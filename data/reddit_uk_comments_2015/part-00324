That said, one thing that I dislike about playing Gomez out as LB is that when we transition to attack, you see the same pattern over and over again. The ball works around the back 4, gets to Gomez, he will take a look up field, but usually he just sends it back across the back four until the ball ends up with Clyne. It was becoming a bit predictable when we played Bournemouth. I must say he gives alot more defensively, and that may be the main reason he is on the pitch, but he gives little if anything offensively. That seems to throw off the balance of our attacks. I would be weary about sticking him out there against arsenal, i don't want the young guy to get skinned too hard. Other than that we seem to look pretty good, you can see the chemistry is just starting to bubble. We have yet to get a good look at our two Brazilians playing together, but Coutinho and Benteke look like they already have a pretty good understanding of each other. Once our other players get a good feel to what he offers as a center forward I can see us giving defenses a real hard time. Pair that with a healthy Sturridge and we can see another formidable offensive partnership.

**The 50/30/20 Budget Rule of Thumb**

Sit down and put pen to paper (or finger to keyboard) to figure out your budget, you may find yourself getting overwhelmed by the minutia of it all or you may be left wondering if your budget is actually realistic. Sometimes it’s helpful to have a benchmark or rule of thumb to compare your budget to see if you’re on the right track.

One rule of thumb that I’ve found helpful when creating my budget was coined by Harvard bankruptcy law professor  Elizabeth Warren. It’s called the 50/30/20 Budget Plan and calls for the following:

* Limit 50% of your after tax income to needs like rent, utilities, food, health insurance, and car insurance. You need to be really strict about what you classify as a need. A cell phone plan with unlimited data and texting isn’t a need; cable isn’t a need; grass-fed buffalo steaks or SuperSonic burgers, while food, aren’t needseither.

* Limit 30% percent of your after tax income to wants. Clothes, eating out, cell phone plans, movies, subscriptions to magazines, apps, etc.

* Spend at least 20% of income on savings or paying down debt. If you have student loans or credit card debt, work on paying that down with at least 20% of your monthly income. Once you pay down your debt, shift to putting that money to retirement savings.

Again, this is just a rule of thumb to offer some guidance. You can adjust it if you want to be more aggressive with your debt repayment or savings. But if your spending roughly matches the 50/30/20 breakdown, you can be confident that you’re on the right track financially.

Because we will not take the Europa League as seriously as the premier league, as much as I want us to.

They, currently, are not better than Ibe, Benteke (although he'll probably play), Milner/Henderson, Sakho/Skrtel - basically the team that should start in the premier league. 

I understand we need a rotation system for EL games, but I absolutely hate it when we make more than 3 changes. Most teams that use their rotation system don't even make more than that. For example, when we played Besiktas and got knocked out, 3 days later (although we beat Soutampton) we played a team with FOUR changes in just the attack. We went from Balotelli and Sturridge and Sterling to Coutinho, Sterling, Markovic and Lallana.

I encourage readers to use their imagination and reflect on this issue for a while.  
  
Here is one way to think about it, your past, present and future interactions with your General Practitioner:  
  
**Past**  
  
Perhaps in your youth you used drugs and required treatment. That information could be extracted and identified with you. It might result in your employment prospects being reduced.  
  
**Present**  
  
You have a sensitive issue you would like to raise with your GP, for example an impotence problem. You might be inhibited from discussing the issue with your GP or getting treatment as knowledge of your treatment could become public.  
  
**Future**  
  
Your silence (not submitting a form) grants consent now and in the future. Developments in medicine, such as personalized genomics, might later be included in the database. An inherited genetic condition might be associated with you in the database and you and your children and grandchildren might be liable to higher insurance premiums.  
  
The issue of health care data security needs greater consideration and once the data goes onto the database in September, it can't be deleted.

Public, Independent &amp; Private schools are all more or less the same thing. They are fee paying non-state run schools that anyone from anywhere can go to as long as they meet the entry requirements. Which specific label of the three is used by any given school is I think mostly determined by what the standard was when the school opened.

Prep Schools are also fee paying non-state schools but they are aimed specifically at early-teen kind of years and *prepare* pupils who will be going on a Public/Independent/Private school.

Boarding Schools are again like the above but refer specifically to schools that have the pupils live on school grounds during their time. To my knowledge these are almost always gendered schools.

Grammar Schools *used* to be ones that specialised in language skills but these days can refer to any high/secondary school.

Depending on where you are in the UK there is 2 or 3 levels of 'standard' and predominantly state run schools.

In Scotland we have Primary School (5-12) and High/Secondary School (12-16/18). 

England has middle schools which are the 9-13 kind of age range. 

*Faith* Schools also exist but can also mean different things. In Scotland we have Catholic-leaning schools. (It's not catholics only, just catholic-leaning). Depending on who you ask these either provide better education through more traditional and strict standards *or* help continue sectarianism.

Not that I think Rodgers would do that, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it because it seems Rodgers values clean sheet to get the confidence high in the team right now.  Moreno and Bellerin are about the same speed.  Lovren would be clearing all balls on his stronger right foot since Arsenal attack mainly down the left.  Gomez normally plays a RCB and would pretty much be doing the same job here.  It gives us the height advantage.

Boarding schools are those where students live on the school grounds during term time. AFAIK, almost exclusively private.

Prep schools are private schools catering for young age groups, normally under 13. Short for preparatory because they prepare you for later school.

Public schools are a select group of private schools with significant history and educational reputation/cachet. Original group defined by the Public Schools Act in the 19th century, so-called because they were ""public"" to anyone who could pay, rather than being restricted to a certain social class or religion. (Don't cite me on this)

State schools are government funded schools, run with taxpayer funding and free for all students. This is the large majority of the UK school system, which runs from Year 1-13 or ages 5-18. 1-6 is commonly referred to as primary school, 7-13 as secondary school. Year 12 and 13 also referred to as sixth form.

Grammar schools are those selextive state secondary schools that require students to have passed an aptitude test at age 11 to attend (at least this is how it used to be for me, not sure how reforms have changed it now. There's also a bunch of weird history that I don't know a lot about). Distinguished from comprehensives which have no such barrier to entry.

To some extent neither certain Labour MP's or the press can always be considered unbiased on this election.

I still believe the better way of handling the Jeremy Corbyn problem from the Labour party's point of view would have been to have more and better MP's standing for election against him, instead of complaining from the side lines, Corbyn just seems to have too much baggage after 32 years in politics.

I commented elsewhere that I've come more to a kind of peace with the probability of a Corbyn victory, an uneasy one, but a peace none the less, and I would rather try and start seeing the party and members start to build the alternative vision for Britain again, one that I hope we all generally share.

- We don't have any true wide players bar Townsend (I'd like to keep playing him of course, might he even be able to play the second striker? a la World Cup Robben/Sanchez?) so we can focus on the center instead.
- We get Eriksen in the most influential role, being the creative hub of the team, and if we play against a team with no DM he could find himself isolated between the lines pretty easily.
- The formation begs for attack-minded fullbacks, and that's pretty much all we have. Won't have a tough time convincing Kyle Walker and Danny Rose to get up and back.
- We have a few solid CM options, and we can adjust to fit the need: want defensive solidity and ball retention? Bentaleb and Dembele. Want to attack at all costs? Mason and Alli. Each pair has one passer and one dribbler, and Poche can mix and match to his desire.
- CDM is the only question mark. I assume that's why we're in the market, and that's why Dier has been converted. Hopefully Dier does well in that role.

Plus it's theoretically perfect against the 4231 itself - we have two CBs to cover the striker, a man on the #10, and Eriksen is naturally free between the lines.

I think the defence dealt with pressure well, keeping bournmouth from having any clear chances, the team as a whole could probably do with starting a little better. I think Moreno starting ahead of Gomez to offer more protection could be a very useful tactic, particularly against arsenal when you have pact players like ox, Sanchez, Walcott. I also think part of the backlash people are having atm is that they expected us to completely steamroll Bournemouth, which was a little disrespectful to bournmouth, they aren't a bad team, and came out of a very competitive championship.

They're disallowing people who have previously shown support for the Green Party and the Socialist Workers Party.

Well, guess what? If you've got broadly socialist values, the Labour Party *was*, traditionally, your home, if you wanted to support and influence a mainstream party that had a cat-in-hell's chance of making a difference. 

Along comes Blair, doing away with much of the tradition of the party - with the support of a large number of its members, let's not forget. So the left-leaning people leave the party (or if they're young, don't join) and seek pastures new: green or SWP being obvious choices. 

And now that Labour looks like turning left again - they can't go back!

This is the most blatant jerrymandering I've ever seen. I was wondering how the ""Establishment"" - which, for the avoidance of any doubt, *unquestionably* includes the upper echelons of the Labour party - was going to react to a resurgence of organised, coherent left-wing opinion.

null,null,strolls,null,null,null,"&gt; Public, Independent &amp; Private schools are all more or less the same thing. They are fee paying non-state run schools that anyone from anywhere can go to as long as they meet the entry requirements. Which specific label of the three is used by any given school is I think mostly determined by what the standard was when the school opened.

Public schools are generally those which have a royal charter (typically 15th or 16th century) or historical charitable status. I think there may also be some that were established by 18th or 19th century acts of Parliament, before the advent of universal education. 

Public schools are all non-profit, and they are not allowed to discriminate against applicants.

Private schools started to proliferate in the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century, to feed the market of educating the children of those who were starting to benefit from the industrial revolution.

Alternatively, sometimes membership of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference is (or was) used to define a public school.

""Independent school"" is an umbrella term which covers both types, and is used to put behind us the snobbishness of the distinction.

Sigh look. You know the numbers you use? That's Indian. Decimalised mathematics came from there. You know the fact we use opiates for pain relief in medicine? Indian. Variolation (the precursor to Vaccination)? Indian. Distillation of Alcohol? AKA Whiskey? Chinese.

That's nonsense. 

1. So you are claiming most of Asia is backwards due to a culture of water bidet usage? Most posher toilets here have a spray for that. I am with the french on this. Bidet Beats Paper. In addition? Most of Asia uses water to wash, not ""their hands"". 

2. There were some Brits near Delhi who molested children. Is it indicative of a savage inability to keep it in their fucking pants? What about the ""Thai"" holidays a lot of young men have. 

3. I am unaware of people not being able to learn the language. Want to know something? The entry requirement for immigrants outside of the EU (AKA most Muslims) is much higher than most locals are expected to attain. So if you want to be a doctor, you need to score a minimum of 7.5 on the IELTS. Most Brits score around 5.5. 

Most Speak English.

Stones is younger than Kalas and has played 50+ games for Everton over the past 2 seasons and if he stays with them this season will no doubt start every game as long as he's fit enough. In the past 2 seasons Kalas had just returned from a successful loan spell with Vitesse although they are a massive downgrade from Everton. He then spent a season with us only really doing well in the game against Liverpool and even in that we played with 10 men behind the ball which made his job so much easier, the few other games he played were not impressive. Then he went on loan for half a season at Koln and didn't make a single first team appearance in a much worse team than Everton. Then on to Middlesborough, he did well, but only well enough to get him another season there, no Premier League interest, but you're right he is of equal quality to Stones. Ake is a little closer and would be more of an asset due to his versatility but he still isn't anywhere close to being as good as Stones.

null,null,RedScouse,lfc12,,null,"Firstly, Allen isn't a defensive midfielder. He plays central midfield, and can play in the holding role, but he's not the type of player that will break up plays or be deep lying playmaker that will have extremely good passing vision to set up attacks. He's solid at recycling possession and covering ground.

Moreover, think through your statement: why should we get a defensively minded midfielder, when we could just have a controlling type midfielder. Look at the first match we played against Stoke. When Coutinho, Milner and Hendo were playing in central midfield, we were on the back foot a fair bit and couldn't hold on to the ball as well, and were constantly pushed off it or made wayward passes due to intense pressure. We brought on Can, and this stabilized the midfield. He was able to take control of the defensive side of the game, and move the ball along to players who were now more focused on attacking, rather than worrying about the defensive side of the game, or coordinating who would cover in defense for each of them. Coutinho, Milner and Hendo knew Can would handle the defensive bit, and didn't have to worry about defending as well, or coordinating who would pick up the slack when one or both of the other two would be in attack. 

Having someone like Illarra, who's not as defensively minded will lead to two things. You won't have someone who's as good defensively, and the other CMs will have to cover for him defensively and coordinate defensive work (whereas they didn't have to for Can). He has solid passing ability, but again, the lack of defensive work will require a lot of coordination and defending between the other midfielders, which we were poor at against Stoke, and will likely be even poorer with against better opposition.

Pogba is an ideal replacement for Toure. 70 mill for a player of his calibre and age is not so unfair as so many people think. He was pivotal for Juve's success and would be a massive capture for us. 

KdB would be an ideal replacement for Silva if you'd ask me but it's very debatable. Nobody can really replace that little magician but de Bruyne would do some pretty good job at it. Many confuse him to a winger, where he plays in the Belgian National team but he's best in the hole where he plays at Wolfsburg... and once Silva's age starts to tire him down, he will take his place.

This question is hard for me but if I had to choose now, I'd take Pogba but mainly because he is more needed atm. Toure is older then Silva so we need his replacement sooner, but Silva won't be here forever and eventually we will have to find a replacement for him. If Toure and Silva would be at the same age, I wouldn't be able to choose.

&gt;Rossiter hasn't been named on the bench once yet and we are yet to see if he will in the cup, hopefully he will. But even then 1 it could be 1 or 2 games he has to prove himself.

Well yeah, we're two games in and like you say we have cup games yet to come. As for him having a couple of games to prove himself, I think that's fair. He deserves a bit of leeway because he's young but in the unlikely circumstance that he's awful then I don't see why he should keep getting game time and jeopardise our chances of silverware.

&gt;Teixera is another example who is very highly regarded and had a good loan spell last season and good preseason.

Teixeira's not even that young anymore, he's only a year younger than Coutinho and Firmino in fact who are way ahead in terms of development. He looks good but we have far too many players ahead of him in his position for him to have any chance of getting into the first team.

&gt;Milner offers nothing to our long term hopes of competing for the top 4 and as a carbon copy of Hendo he offers nothing new.

Milner is a really good player and is probably better than Henderson at this point. There's a reason City wanted to keep him.

&gt;You say he couldn't afford to play academy kids but he could afford to play Allen who funnily enough played most games during our winning streak early in the year. The players I've mentioned are all better than Allen yet he still didn't give them a chance

&gt; And before you call me whatever for not supporting palestine, I support a two state solution, which Jeremy clearly doesn't. Atrocities and terrorist acts are committed on both sides, Jeremy only recognises terrorism from Israel on Palestine. Double standards.

How did you come to that conclusion? Where has Jeremy said he doesn't support a two state solution? Again, pathetic straw man arguments. Jeremy has never denied that Hamas has committed terrorist acts, they blindly fire rockets into the sky for fuck sake. But it is a disproportionate conflict, and the larger share of the responsibility lies on Israel. Regardless, both sides need to answer for their crimes against humanity.

null,null,CodeRed1234,null,null,null,"I like our Owners, they've given us so much money to spend because they're ambitious, I doubt they would tell Rodgers to take the PL more seriously, when the EL can also guarantee CL football. 

A weaker side is never enough in the EL league. These teams that aren't supposedly as good as the others MORE than make up for it with their drive and willingness to win. They always want it more. Every time we've been knocked out in the last 5 years it's been to a team we should have beaten, but didn't because the other team wanted it more than we did. (Bar THAT game against Zenit. Suarez wanted that more than any fucking person in that game) 

I like our squad this year, I think it's improved, still want to see a Sakho/Lovren partnership but I don't think we'll see it. Clyne solves a problem we've had at RB for years, and Gomez/Moreno should provide adequate competition for each other for the LB spot. 

Regardless of how we've improved depth-wise, you can't just pluck players in and out and expect the team to play the same way, which is essentially what Rodgers rotation system expects to do. Firmino, Coutinho and Lallana, for example, will probably play the same position for most games. You can't take either of the first 2 out, put Lallana in, and expect the same attacking effect. Same goes for if we put Markovic for Ibe, Allen for Milner, etc. Whilst I like both and think they'll eventually come good, the side will just underperform because you've replaced 4 very good players with 4 good, not in form players who barely get game time.

There's something about the name 'Zac' that just signals to me that the testimonial is made up. I don't know what it is because I know that people out there called 'Zac', 'Zack', and 'Zachary' exist (and other variations) - but it seems to be a go-to name that companies use when making a quote up. It's weird because you'd think they'd stick with a 'John' or a 'David' but maybe they second guess themselves and say that those names are so obvious that people will see through the charade and realise that they're also fake? I don't know. It's probably confirmation bias or something but there's definitely something about the name 'Zac' which sets off my bullshit detector. Anyways, I'm drunk and on a train so this is probably a silly thing I'm thinking too much about, but keep an eye out for 'Zac' in other literature and see if you think it's bullshit.

1 - Ibe.

He's constantly double/triple teamed and this is not good (obviously). Now on an offensive level this is apparent because the ball gets pulled into a vacuum, but against Arsenal this will be a huge threat against us defensively. Arsenal have shown that they can make the transition into an attacking move from the defensive block ridiculously fast. If Ibe is triple-teamed then not only does he lose the ball, but the tackler has an immediate passing option, along with an extra to bypass the full back as well. Seeing how narrow we've played on Ibe's side, this is a particular worry. Not to mention that the double trouble of Joe Gomez vs. Alexis Sanchez with only Lovren to cover. This could be alleviated by starting Ibe on the right with Clyne (still risky), or benching him in favor of Milner on the wing with Lallana, Lucas (Henderson), Can in the middle, which I straight up don't see happening. 

2 - Lallana.

I love this guy. He's probably one of my favorite players in the team right now, which is funny because I totally hated on him at the start too. Contrary to popular belief (the shitshow that was the Nicol thread), I think he provides something that our midfield desperately needs, especially if Henderson doesn't start. If we get the midfield trio of Milner, Can, and Lallana against Arsenal, we NEED some form of control, and that's where Adam comes into play. While he doesn't have the same discipline and physical strength/stamina that Henderson does, he does have that extra touch of class. What people see as ""overplaying"" on the wing, leading to missed chances, I see as something that could be turned into a vital piece of our midfield, especially against Arsenal, providing he has a passing outlet under pressure. We need to maintain a semblance of control against the Gunners or else they will shred us, and Lallana holding possession might help a bit.


3 - Lovren

Here is where we will have trouble. Arsenal at home hold possession in the final third very well, requiring discipline in defence. Lovren has been better, much much better, but we haven't come up against this type of sustained, patient pressure yet. Neither Skrtel or Lovren are known for their brilliant decision-making or patience, so we may have issues with runners in behind. I'm hoping that it's Skrtel that's replaced for Sakho, but against Arsenal? Tough ask for Sakho, and a conundrum for Rodgers for sure.

In a side-note, anybody who wants to rant about the refs favoring us that game I say you take what you can get. Fuck the haters, fuck everybody else who tries to pull this shit.

Say you insist that the CEO's wage should be a fixed multiple of the lowest wage.

Here's how it could pan out in a small IT company. The guys all earn £100k writing gaming software, but employ a secretary on 20k and an in-house cleaner on above the minimum wage (which works out at about £10k). Everyone has perks because this is an IT start-up and they like doing that stuff.

Corbyn brings in his rule. Company sacks cleaner to ensure the lowest paid is now the secretary and out sources the cleaning. The new out-sourced cleaner now takes a pay cut down to minimum wage, and loses her perks. So the IT staff are still earning nicely and their company is merrily going along, but the cleaner loses out thanks to Corbyn. The cleaning company owner being savvy doesn't pay herself a salary at all, she pays herself dividends. So she's exempt too.

Or Scenario 2. Say you have a fixed maximum wage.

Here's how that would pan out: Larger company that has a range of staff at a range of salaries. They shift the high paying staff to Dublin, which lowers the salaries in the UK. The staff are paid the same under this scenario, but HM govt loses all the lovely tax revenue from the higher paying people (because they are now abroad). This impact Corbyn's spending plans.

null,null,Capital_Punisher,null,null,null,"Not sure if there is anywhere you can get a private chef at every table, but as a massive foodie, here is my input:

* Chai Shai - Jacob's Wells Road on the roundabout.  PHENOMENAL authentic indian food.  Don't think you'll get the normal takeaway style menu full of madras, korma and vindaloo, this stuff is the real deal.  5 out of 5 stars on FB and 4.8 according to Trip Advisor, both after hundreds of reviews.  I live around the corner and spend a lot of time here.  Its BYO, informal and 1/2 the price it should be. TRY IT!!

* Steak Of The Art - on the Harbourside by Millennium Square.  Great steak served in a futuristic art gallery. Sous vide to perfection before being charred on the outside for flavour. I have literally paid 5x more for a lesser steak (albeit in London). Great house wines and a more formal atmosphere without being too ""fancy"".

* The Rummer - St Nicholas Market.  They do regular tasting menus of 5/7 courses that are a delight.  They have a fine dining room downstairs in the cellar but you may need a larger group (which i have done but with a few of us via work)

*  Bordeaux Quay - The Harbourside.  Downstairs is relatively informal, upstairs is white linen table cloths and the sommelier knows his shit (if you like wine).  The food at both levels is great, but upstairs is more fine dining.

Feel free to ask any questions!

EDIT:  I'm going to give a very special mention to Spoke &amp; Stringer - Also on the Harbourside but with an amazing waterview (bet you can't guess where I live?!) which is a tapas bar that has recently opened up.  I've eaten there 5 times in the 4 months they have been open and everyone I have taken has been SO impressed.  It's got to the point where I have now tried everything they have on the menu and I still want more....

Be Quiet Dark Rock Pro 2 CPU Cooler 

Im selling my amazing CPU cooler - the Dark Rock Pro 2 from Be Quiet. 
This cooler is amazing with a great ratio of sound to performance.

I honestly believe allowing families to grow exponentially when they wouldn't be able to afford shoes without government handouts is more damaging for the children involved.

That said, all children pay for their parents mistakes at some point in their lives. The responsibility of the parents will undoubtedly affect a child in one way or another.  

Let's take your argument and apply it to other circumstances. 

A man is arrested for burglary and assault. He has a new born child. Should he be sentenced to prison even though the child would be put at a disadvantage because of his father's responsibility? 

Or let's say a family hasn't paid taxes for 10 years but have had a new born child. Should they pay the money back? If so it would put the child at a disadvantage caused by its parents irresponsible actions.

I think adults have a responsibility for their children but shouldn't be given compensation just because they have a child.

Even though there are things like deflating footballs or other things that happen in every game, NFL is choosing to make Brady the example to save face. Even the other players (an [article](http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13423597/nfl-player-survey-reveals-majority-think-new-england-patriots-deflated-footballs-cheaters) by ESPN says 60 out of 100 players polled wouldn't call the Pats cheaters.

We won 1-0

&gt; Because we still don't have strikers or attacking midfielders who are consistent enough to actually score a simple goal against an average 

We have 2 goals, one from an attacking midfielder and another from a striker. 

&gt; And we still don't have a defense that is capable of anything

We have 2 clean sheets in a row. Losing Lucas is a stupid move I agree, we shouldn't loan or sell him.

&gt; All we do is go out and fuck around in the middle of the park for 90 minutes every fucking game. 

Not sure how to reply to that. Other than, that simply isn't true. 

First of all, what do you define as a fail? Anything less than the final = a fail? I think we won't fail because the season you mentioned with Suarez and Sturridge is the only season we've had 2 great goal scorers (bar this one). Benteke isn't anywhere near as good as Suarez obviously, but I think he will get into the high teens in the league and around 22 in all comps assuming he's fit. By the time we make it into the knockout stages I think we'll have a fit Sturridge back and that firing power can win a lot games.

Defensively, Clyne has been a brilliant purchase if the first 2 games are anything to go by. Nothing has been created down his flank from the opposition. Lovren has also improved in his first 2 appearances compared to his first 2 for us last season. Everything will need work obviously, we've brought in like 6 players.

Its main competition used to be a U.S. highway and is now called Cruiseways, Inc. Rte. Cal-12. Farther up the Valley, the two competing highways actually cross. Once there had been bitter disputes, the intersection closed by sporadic sniper fire. Finally, a big developer bought the entire intersection and turned it into a drivethrough mall. Now the roads just feed into a parking system—not a lot, not a ramp, but a system-and lose their identity. Getting through the intersection involves tracing paths through the parking system, many braided filaments of direction like the Ho Chi Minh trail.

How often did you need to wear the gown? Wondering if I should splash out. I plan on keeping my gown, like a wedding dress, as a reminder of my time at Cambridge. Btw, I had a look at the Ede and Ravenscroft website, and the gown + hood + hat would cost me £233! Bit steep. £190 without the hat, which I assume is just a generic mortarboard?

Also, do I need to get a hood now, or is it just for when (well, hopefully anyway!) I graduate?

a - he's only on the ball as a secondary playmaker (thus the excellent midfielder inside him)

b - making a move that may result in loss of possession (and on the flip side a beaten and broken defensive scheme when it succeeds) is mitigated by the wide defender behind him

c - giving the two defenders on his side a fit by making them choose him or the striker inside him

Given that we have Walker behind (adequate, but not much more), some combination of Mason or Dembele or Bentaleb or whomever inside (none of whom can reasonable play their own position and give Lamela cover when his moves breakdown), and Kane in front (a lot of good things, but not exactly threatening to blow up a central defender-fullback tandem by blowing by them), Lamela just doesn't fit on the wing.

And I don't think he fits in the center, either - he's too easily dispossessed to be the main playmaker going forward.

Also we were in the Champions where the quality in general is higher (Real Madrid were in our group). The last time we were in the Europa league we got through the group stages with Rodgers. 

The 6-1 result was a complete fluke evidenced by the fact that it was the first time we had ever conceded 6 goals in the premier league. 

&gt; Our defense is the same one that struggled to do anything all last year, plus some fullbacks.

Plus one of the best fullbacks in the league and an improving CB. 

I'm not ignoring Lovrens performances last season at all. As I said he has improved his performances for his first two games *compared to his first 2 last season.* And compared his first run with the side, compared to the form he's currently in, he's improved his performances. Something you conveniently missed as well. 2 of our 4 defenders have improved on last season, but you'll still stick with your baseless idea that our defence is incapable of anything. 

One of our goals was a wonder goal, you get those every now and then. Go look at a Luis Suarez/Steven Gerrard compilation. You have a couple a season from a couple of players. Our other goal was very simple. It should have been ruled offside but now Coutinho and the rest of the team will not make that mistake again. The actual play itself was simple. One in swinging cross aimed at the far post for our Striker to run onto. What isn't simple about that? 

&gt; And everyone said that last August as well after we spent over a hundred fucking million and brought in almost a full new first team squad. Give it time for them to fail to gel again. 

That means the team is improving. If year on year fans think their team can do better than last. We were also in a more difficult competition that our main striker was not fit for. He literally played 0 games in the champions league. And at that point we only had 1 competent striker.

null,null,The_Disco_Spider_,null,null,null,"&gt;Firstly, Allen isn't defensive midfielder.

I know. I didn't say he was a DM at all.

&gt;He plays central midfield, and can play in the holding role

Yes, this is why he'd be a great 2nd/3rd choice beind Emre Can and Illaramendi.

&gt;Look at the first match we played against Stoke. When Coutinho, Milner and Hendo were playing in central midfield, we were on the back foot a fair bit and couldn't hold on to the ball as well, and were constantly pushed off it or made wayward passes due to intense pressure. **We brought on Can, and this stabilized the midfield.**

Emre Can is not a DM like Gattuso, De Jong or Lucas but he completely changed our game. This is why I said there's no need to get a defensive midfielder when we can just get a controlling, holding MF. Especially as Illaremendi is available.


&gt;Having someone like Illarra, who's not as defensively minded will lead to two things. You won't have someone who's as good defensively, and the other CMs will have to cover for him defensively and coordinate defensive work (whereas they didn't have to for Can). He has solid passing ability, but again, the lack of defensive work will require a lot of coordination and defending between the other midfielders

Illaramendi is defensively minded enough though, about as much as Emre Can. Which is to say, not actually that much for someone playing as the deepest midfielder.

They're not as defensive minded as Mascherano or Lucas were, nor are they as defensively absent minded as Gerrard was as the holding midfielder.

You're looking at an Alonso or Marchisio type, where of course you put in challenges and break up opposition play. But the main objective is to give the CB's an option and dictate the play with vision and a good passing range. Illaramendi has a little more experience but Emre Can has more physicality.

Illaramendi sat deepest with Henderson and Milner slightly advanced on either side, with Emre Can ready to come off the bench for any if them has us set in my opinion.",null,0,null,1440184272,null,null,false,0,cuazq9d,null,t3_3hu8r5,null,null,null,t1_cuaucw1,null,null,null,1441390105,null,1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

&gt; I tend not to criticise entire groups of people anyway. 

I *tend* not to. I do it when it's fair to do it. In the case of the Orange Order, it is a sectarian organisation, and I stand by that. If it wasn't, I'd be able to join it, or I'd at least get an invite from someone to join in the celebrations on the Twelfth. All my Orange friends make suspicious disappearances on that day. When I was a teenager, the youth group I was with was almost turned away from the Apprentice Boys museum because there were Catholics in the group. They had to have a discussion to decide whether to let us in or not, and when they did they disallowed us from some rooms. That's blatant fucking sectarianism. 

&gt; This from the person claiming no unionist/nationalist bias. Which is it to be?

I never *ever* claimed to have no bias, that is almost an impossible task, especially having grown up among nationalists. I only ever claimed to try to be fair to either side. There's only so much I can tell you from my experiences, so if you've experienced something entirely different then tell me about it. My views aren't at all concrete and never have been. Some people are much more stubborn about their views. 

&gt; Irrelevant when talking about unionist/nationalist issues.

This is exactly what I'm talking about. Everyone is either unionist or nationalist to you.

Let's take the argument 'A child should not be punished for their parents irresponsible actions.' and apply it to other situations.

A man is convicted of burglary and assault. He has just had a child. The child will suffer if the man is sentenced. Should the man be responsible for his actions even though it would cause the child to suffer?

This is not about punishing children. This is about adults making responsible choices in life.

Literally? Literally absolving your usual group of blame that's all.

&gt;I *tend* not to. I do it when it's fair to do it. In the case of the Orange Order, it is a sectarian organisation, and I stand by that. If it wasn't, I'd be able to join it. 

Does that mean the Jesuits are sectarian too? Or can I join them? 

An obviously grotesque generalisation. Again in one direction only.

No, the question IS whether Islam is compatible with secularism and it's becoming pretty clear/has been clear to many people that it's not. 


I agree you should be able to practice your religion, but when you believe gays should be killed, when you believe the same for apostates, that cartoonists who draw a 'prophet' should be at the very least prosecuted or in extreme cases, murdered, then I think your religion is completely and utterly non-compatible with a secular western society. How many muslims would be comfortable with the idea of a caliphate? These are not exactly unusual views to have within Islam.


I have no interest in 'integrating' with homophobes and zealots. Christian, Jewish, Muslim or otherwise I think it's a stone-age religion. Again you keep using these platitudes, 'willingness to embrace new ideas', 'not living within the confines of absoutes', sorry, but this is wishy-washy vagueness that helps no-one.


Islam is very much different, I'd argue followers of Islam are generally way more devout and extreme than followers of other religions. Their faith is absolutely integral to their way of life, I know many Christians and Jews who would not say that. The majority of muslims I have known, and muslims I have seen speak on Television and in debates are much more devout. These are people who won't change their minds.

Since her iPhone broke, I told her not to unbox the new phone just in case. I believe they told her that to take out the contract she would need to receive some sort of phone, so threw in the cheapest one they sold. She could then use the SIM to carry on using her old phone.

I wasn't in the country at the time it happened so I didn't have any input; by the sounds of it she was signed up by the time she got off the phone. Had I been around I would have told her to cancel it ASAP. 

I don't think the new phone really has apps and media as such :p I'm not 100% sure what happened with regard to the SIM card, but she's currently using her old phone and old number.

My assumption is that they realised she was old and not so tech savvy so bigged up the contract, preyed on her naivety, and pushed for the biggest  sale they could get, which kinda sucks. My best guess is that the contract should have cost her around £7-8 a month, so its a pretty big difference.",null,0,null,1440186006,null,null,false,0,cub0uez,null,t3_3hvhd7,null,null,null,t1_cuaz4xa,null,null,null,1441390631,null,1,null,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1,null

null,null,riyten,null,null,null,"Here's a snapshot of how the BBC has affected my life:

The BBC is the biggest employer of musicians in the UK. It works with unions and pays fair rates. It invests in the lowest levels and eagerly seeks out fresh talent (BBC Young Musician Competition, for example). Most of its programmes feature proper music, composed especially by British talent. I'm talking from CBeebies up to the BBC 1 nature docs. BBC radio is THE platform if you're an up and coming artist in the UK. Get on BBC Introducing and you have a promotional pathway to follow, thanks to the Beeb, which can include playing at Glastonbury. 

As a kid, my life's ambition was to write the music for a BBC show (I quite fancied *Gardener's World*, for some reason). As a teenager, I played in the Albert Hall on live TV, thanks to the BBC. They funded a project which linked professional music groups with kids like me, where we wrote a piece together and performed as part of the Proms series (oh yes, the Proms are fully organised by the BBC). And now, finally, this year, I might actually get to be a part of the music for the next David Attenborough documentary (funding permitting). 

The BBC literally inspired, funded and allowed my career. I owe it my livelihood.

I could have written this little piece if I were a script-writer, a make-up artist, an actor, a sound engineer, a camera operator, a light rigger, a subtitler, a graphic designer, a 3D modeller. The BBC is our largest and most crucial employer and curator of the creative industry. Currently, it could be said to be leading the world. Tragically, I don't know if this will be true in 10 years' time.

""My"" usual group? You talk some shite. First of all, you didn't label a bonfire as nationalist, your title says, ""Nationalists burn poppy wreath on bonfire"". As I already explained, this is divisive language, and implies that the burning of poppies was a widespread activity, rather than an act carried out by an extremely small number of individuals, their political views completely unknown to you. 

&gt; Does that mean the Jesuits are sectarian too? Or can I join them?

The Jesuits are a religious organisation. The Orange Order is a protestant-only fraternal organisation whose sole purpose is to promote Protestantism.

null,null,lux_roth_chop,null,null,null,"While I appreciate the sentiment behind this, it seems unsavory to me in several key ways. 

First, it very badly oversteps the bounds of science. The purpose of science is to discover and deliver information, not to command behavior. 

In this case, that information suggests to me that homeopathy is not an effective treatment method. But it does not follow scientifically that no one should be allowed to use it. Freedom of choice, even the choice to use treatments which have only placebo value, is key to all medical treatment.

Second, people in Africa are not benighted credulous savages who can be duped at will. They are people just like you and me and just as intelligent. If we want them to have the same opportunities as us they need to be able to choose like us. Censoring their access to information will not create a utopia. 

Lastly it's clear from the wording that the agenda here is to go after a wide range of charities. That's fine and I endorse the right to do so. But it's not science and to do so under its guise is disingenuous at best. Science does not work by censoring views you don't like. It works by presenting better information and inviting the audience to choose it rationally. 

I applaud anyone offering a better option than homeopathy. But that doesn't imply and I think should never mean that no one should be allowed to choose or offer homeopathy. I think all people of sound mind and good conscience should be empowered to choose to reject it on rational grounds.

null,null,aCowbell,null,null,null,"The fact that we consider this impossible is a bit strange. It is almost as if Chelsea were embarrassed by its financial wealth for the last couple of years - sensibly moving players on and finding great (if not necessarily world-class) replacements - and didn't want to splurge for fear of 'buying the league' claims. To a certain extent, I understand. But now that Man U is spending mega-millions and Man City have strengthened at great (even greater, if they get KDB) cost, a Pogba deal is something we CAN and SHOULD do to remain competitive with the ultra-elites of world football. 

Incredible players leave great teams to go to Real, Barcelona etc. not for the money or because they're guaranteed to be the stars but because they get to play with players they consider to be some of the world's best. To continually challenge yourself and produce brilliance with others on your level is far more of a driver (I think) than money or history.

When PSG, Real, Man U and Man C want someone, they go and get them and damn FFP and the cost. I get that it feels dirty to pay such a high price with the ghost of Torres ever-looming but the fact is that to compete with the ultra rich elites, you sometimes have to bring in a top-ten player at a top-ten cost. 

Watching the Man City game at the weekend really brought this home for me. We've got Hazard and Courtois as our two truly world-class players that any team would want. If we step back and aren't truly challenging in Europe and domestically - and aren't making steps to get even better - these ultra-rich teams could step in and make an offer for our best players and we're back to square one. 

Hazard had the pick of the litter and he chose Chelsea because we were champions of Europe - meaning we had the talent to make him an even better player as well. Now with our legends leaving it is time to get another one in to improve the status of Chelsea FC, help us keep our world-class talent and KTBFFH for years to come. Pogba is only 22. 

All that being said, I'd be shocked if we got him. Nonetheless, I think we should.

I never had to do CAD over the holidays, but I did frequently need access to Matlab (even then, GNU Octave is usually sufficient).

Not completely. But fairly significantly, yes they are. And it's comically naive to think otherwise.

It's the reason that [places with the lowest immigration have so much concern about immigration](http://www.cityam.com/1414419679/ukip,-mapped-nigel-farage-most-popular-in-areas-with-the-fewest-immigrants) for example.

It's the reason that [governments ramp up the fear of terrorism](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/13/distorted-fears-cost-lives-terrorism-murders) to bring in ever more draconian laws.

&gt;The reason they believed that the Tories were right about our overspending is that, as far back as 2001, people were sufficiently concerned about overspending, particularly on welfare to stop voting for the party,

And vote for one with a historically worse record on overspending than them.

&gt;Even many on the left criticised us over the expense of PFI, an argument which was usually framed as 'it isn't cost-effective'; in other words, even people on the left were getting annoyed by 'misspending', if not overspending.

And we were right to because it was the Wonga of government finance. It was originally a Tory policy, expanded massively by a right-leaning Labour party, yet it's the left wing of the spectrum that is continually painted as being profligate.

&gt; As I said, even SNP voters didn't consider austerity to be the major reason for voting SNP (although it was important), as the study referred to in this article shows.

Only that's not what it seems to say at the bottom - ""It is true that the anti-austerity message strikes home in Scotland. However, many Scottish voters think that their economic interests are more likely to be looked after in an Independent Scotland.""

In other words, as I'd suggested earlier - the initial pro-independence vote was at least partly driven by a desire to move away from the UK's austerity drive as was the further swing at the election. They just thought it was best achieved through an independent Scotland.

&gt;By the way, even I don't think the SNP are 'good, honest people', frankly. They've lied about virtually everything they've ever done

I wasn't trying to use gotcha or whatever that means, I was trying to have a discussion. I only mused suchlike as i have no idea where you got that i believed those with large families are stupid.

As I mentioned before, which you ignored, is that I am proud to live in a country has schemes in place to help people that fall into unforseen circumstances. 

I also mentioned that I don't think it is unreasonable to expect someone to have less than 3 children in their lifetime. If they do they should be aware of their situation.

I also don't think I should pay for your decision to have children you can't afford. I want children. I am in a relationship. So far it hasn't been the hardest job in the world to not have a child until we're ready. Never mind three of them.

How do you think the millions in other countries get by without government assistance for children? They don't abort every pregnancy or sell their children to slavery when times get hard. They manage, usually because of the loving home that they built. Why should Britain be any different? 

I feel like you are insinuating that the only reason people have more than three children is because the government is helping them. I feel like that is a ridiculous statement. If you're not insinuating that and I have read your attentions wrong then what does this change? If those who have large families would do so without government subsidy then they will do it regardless of this law.

I hope there I haven't offended you again with another three word sentence, if so I didn't mean to. I would like to carry on this discussion though, albeit preferably without swearing, expletives or even the need of exclamations.

I'll start out by saying he's a quality shot stopper, but not much more. His distribution is terrible (no secret), his command of area is bad (there is more to commanding than just yelling at players), he is very oblivious to his surroundings, once he loses his nerve he's gone.

So many people on this sub have forgotten that he was so bad the first half of last season that Rodgers had to drop him from the team entirely for Jones, only getting back into the team because Jones injured himself.

People started raving about his 'revival' but i think its just a coincidence that his revival came at the same time Rodgers made major changes to the formation and playing style, in particular playing 3 at the back with Can in CB forcing play up the pitch as far away from the Goal as possible and us attacking more aggressively using sterling up front.

The one game that he really pissed me off the most in was against Villa. [This goal is entirely his fault](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ViOm6yd4R0g/UtrDIDBKetI/AAAAAAAABXU/GmFbsrQQrMY/s0/18-01-2014-GifNumber-81.gif) but this is the sort of thing he did again and again that season. Even though Johnson clearly has it covered he comes out and makes a ridiculous one arm attempt knocking the ball over his head into the path of Benteke away from the 2 defenders in front of him. What grinds me is is that even though he is in no immediate danger with 2 defenders in front of him he seems to be completely oblivious that benteke is there or that Johnson can handle it he comes bumbling off the line and knocks it into his path. Later that game he again is day dreaming again, not commanding his area or watching for other players sneaking in and comes completely off his line [instead of trusting the 3 players in front of him to deal with it](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_-cFU1RGdhc/UtrAHqf_pmI/AAAAAAAABXI/B5C9sRwrsSo/s0/18-01-2014-GifNumber-80.gif). 

he made far less mistakes the second half of the season but the first two season he was here I constantly saw him make mistake after mistake and the blame went everywhere else but on him, then when he got dropped suddenly everybody noticed how bad he was. I mean credit to him for improving but for me I could never trust a keeper that could fall to that level of mediocrity when he's not feeling confident, its far too much of an important position to gamble on.

Looking at [this Income Statement](http://swissramble.blogspot.com/search/label/Liverpool) for Liverpool you can see that the operating result (EBITDA) for 2014 is 53.2 million GBP while their net debt is 126.3 million GBP. [Tottenham](http://swissramble.blogspot.com/search/label/Tottenham%20Hotspur) are much better off because while their operating result (EBITDA) is only 29 million GBP, their net debt is -3.2 million GBP. A negative net debt means they have enough cash to cover all their debt, plus some extra.


Obviously Liverpool has the capacity to generate much more revenue, but being so in debt drives down a valuation of the business.

null,null,SoyBeanExplosion,,Labour | Co-op | Fabians,null,"I think we need more fundamental reform so that the government doesn't need to keep stepping in. If the employees had more of a say in how the company was run (through a co-operative structure) as well as representation of the workers and trade unions on the actual board of directors, these disgusting pay disparities would never have been allowed to arise in the first place. Minimum/maximum wage laws are entirely unnecessary if you empower workers. Trade unions do a better job of enforcing the minimum wage than the government ever could. Once you get that kind of structure in place in these huge corporations, I think schemes like that would inevitably be adopted - workers would never accept the idea that the CEO's pay has no link at all to their own.

For a real life example of a similar policy *actually* in practice right now, at John Lewis, every employee receives a bonus at the end of the year. The amount is the same for every employee, and is directly linked to the company's overall profitability that year. So every employee has a direct investment on making sure the company they work in is successful, because *everyone*, not just the CEO, does well out of it. Every employee is a Partner in the company. On top of that, 5 of the 10 board seats are appointed by the Partnership Council, 80% of whom are elected directly by the Partners (i.e. employees).

These are the kinds of business stuctures Labour ought to be encouraging with specific incentives, carrots and sticks.

Why? The child hasn't committed a crime and that is the logical conclusion to your argument in my opinion, that is your argument isn't it? The child should not be punished for their parents irresponsible actions. I think commiting a crime counts as an irresponsible action.

Let's make the exclusion of crimes then. A child shouldn't be punished for his parents irresponsible actions unless the irresponsible action is a crime.

A single mother goes out with her friends to a casino. She loses all the money she had and won't be able to feed her child for the next week. Should she be exempt from paying because the child will suffer because of her irresponsible action?

Whatever way you look at it children will always suffer because of parents bad life choices. My point is that it impossible to govern or pass any law that has to pass that test.

I think you misunderstood me; that was the point I was trying to make. Even if the team sheet shown on TV at the beginning of the game is a 4-3-3 with Sturridge as a RW, he will still be a forward and will get himself into those central areas. He won't be a winger in the traditional since at all. Neither would Firmino.

I referenced 12/13 because our front three was extremely fluid, and the formation, outside of the shape of the midfield three, really meant fuck all.

I especially agree with your points on Benteke, that he is more mobile and versatile than most would let on. Still, two games on, the team has obviously been instructed to get it up long to Benteke as an outlet when other teams press us from the front.

We used to do a lot of TICs, as did quite a lot of other forces. There have been occasions where people have manipulated the system. It can be manipulated by officers and offenders.”
Met police chief says all burglary victims should get police visit

&gt; The Met says the overall number of burglaries has fallen in the last five years, from 65,840 in 2010-11 to 50,662 in 2014-15, in line with the falling national trend in reported crime.

&gt;McCartney said: “It’s clear the historic inclusion of TICs meant solved burglary figures were padded out, making them look much better than they were”.

This is all about the changes in the way detections are now recorded. It wasn't unusual for burglars to admit a string of offences after being convicted of a few, and this dramatically affected figures. However, with no real incentive to do so (i.e. it rarely affected sentencing and earned no credit) and problems in accountability on both sides of the fence, the practice has been stopped.

Step 2: Create incentives for businesses to encourage people to work from home. Lower employer NI contributions by 1 - 2% for homeworkers over X hours a week, sufficient to cover the increased IT costs to businesses on top of savings in office square footage. Offer cheaper season tickets in large cities like London for only commuting in 2 / 3 days a week to reduce the pressure on limited transport infrastructure; offer free / reduced rate parking for those who work outside of towns and cities.

Additional bonuses: Reduced carbon emissions as fewer people need to travel to work. People spend more time with their families.

null,null,Be_lieve,null,null,null,"Depends on what kind of person you are. I'm a mature student at the university here and when I moved here I went straight for a studio flat. I did not want to rely on other people, whether they're clean, loud, cause problems or whatever.. I've seen some people having real problems with their flatmates and that's why I chose not to have anyone's problems influence my life. If you find a flatmate you'll rely on paying rent together, if your flatmate for whatever reason wants to move out or can't pay the rent you'll have no choice but to move out too. 

I pay a bit more than other students sharing a house with 7-8 others, but in the end it's my place. If I want to be social I can go out, and when I want to be on my own I can comfortably stay in. I don't share my bathroom/kitchen so I don't have to worry about others not cleaning. 

I have a friend who found a flatmate so they could rent a 2 bedroom house together, she got kicked out of her course at uni and because she was on student visa she had to leave the country. This left her flatmate in an awful situation. You need to make sure that you can rely on your flatmate to keep to the contract you both sign.

I'm not fond of sharing a living a space but I can understand why some people do it - it's cheaper and you meet people. I moved to Bristol 3 years ago and still live in the same studio for around 500 pcm. It depends on where you'll be living, areas near city centre would obviously cost a lot more. 

Also, some agencies would want to have someone as your guarantor and if you don't have one, they might ask you to pay rent 6 (or more) months up front. Agencies can also charge for a holding deposit to 'reserve' a property before you sign a tenancy agreement, mine charged 200 at the time.

Well I'm not against the idea in principle, but the problem I have is that those who gain the most from a company's profits often don't actually take a salary (or at least not an insane one in many cases). Personally, I feel that the greater good is best served by demanding that companies essentially profit-share with their employees. Although this may have the effect of discouraging investment in very large and profitable companies, I suspect that they wouldn't exactly collapse.

To be honest, I think there's a place for both. I don't really think either solution is applicable to all types of company or employee, but I strongly believe that one or both should be implemented. I'm wary of caps on pay - I'm more of a liberal when it comes to things like that really. There's no real reason why people shouldn't be able to earn trillions - but doing so without also substantially rewarding the people who get you there is something that we as a society need to start rejecting. I feel that if you're an employee of a multi-billion dollar company which is making a profit, then you should be able to expect a share of that profit. All things said and done this might not work out to a whole lot of money depending on the size of the company and the profit margins, but I can't help but come to the same conclusion every time: we cannot afford to have rapid growth if it means that the poorest stagnate or even become relatively poorer. We should all benefit from the wealth that a society can create.

EDIT: To clarify my position a little, I believe the biggest problem right now is the corporate investor class. This phenomenon means businesses become unaccountable, and the primary objective becomes to increase profits at any cost. A relatively small number of people end up reaping the benefits of the work of a multitude of employees, whilst effectively contributing nothing but money in the hopes of making more money. Money doesn't make money. Effort makes money. Without effort, nothing gets produced. No goods, no services, no nothing.

My main concern has been, and still is, the idea of whether he fits the style of play that has worked best for us (meaning the pacey, high pressing and passing football of 13/14). *As of yet*, I don't think he has shown that he does fit that style of play. However, that isn't really his fault as the team as a whole hasn't played that kind of football yet. Quite on the contrary, it seems that having a big man up top has encouraged people (mignolet, centre backs) to go for long balls to him. Which hasn't really worked out all that well. 

But in fairness, when Liverpool started playing well during 13/14, Rodgers had had basically the same starting XI for the last 8 months. Coutinho and Sturridge came in at the beginning of 2013 and at the start of the new season we played really scrappy and managed to just get away with some really tight wins until the players started to find each other. Making a team play that well is really hard and I don't expect us to play fantastically beautiful free flowing football after just two months while integrating 5 new players to the starting XI.

I've never doubted that Benteke's a gifted footballer, but I'm still doubting whether he'll fit in if/when the team actually gets playing. What I'm basically afraid of is that he'll become our Giroud. They're similar players: very gifted, decent with the ball at their feet, using their strength and power. But Giroud isn't really working out for Arsenal and they're looking to buy someone else. Personally I would have preferred Carlos Bacca before Benteke.

So I don't think my own concerns and doubts about Benteke can be corrected just by seeing him run around while we're playing quite bad football. I'd like to see him work in a team that is playing well. Then again, if he scores five or six winning goals now at the start of the season giving us valuable points, I can be fine with him being just that.

I was only trying to circumnavigate the same situation by pre-emptivly diffusing any slight you might have perceived and actually have a conversation. 

I don't believe that my argument does exclude it. For clarification I will highlight my points for you in reference.

Unplanned: Children are unplanned now and parents have to make the same decisions. No one who has a unplanned third child has kept it purely because the government subside it. Therefore this law doesn't affect that decision. 

Unforeseen Circumstances: We are lucky to live in a country that have schemes specifically to help people that fall into unforseen circumstances. These schemes exist and I believe will actually benefit from having the administration resources that could be tied up in large scale family subsidiaries. 

&gt;&gt; I feel like you are insinuating that the only reason people have more than three children is because the government is helping them

&gt;I have no idea where on earth you got that from

If you believe families are now unlikely to have more than three children because of this law you are also saying that the reason they have three or more now is because they were subsidised.  It is the only variable that changed so the reverse must be true.

Also our midfielders are good at pressing, but not great against the press as none of them are super smooth in possession(I'm talking the back two, not guys like Eriksen or Dembele).

The 4-4-2 is good against the press theoretically because pressing teams often will isolate the oppositions forward against a single defender with the logic being that the front of the press will deny the forward the ball so it won't matter.  By having a second option up front you can potentially exploit this if the team doesn't adjust properly to the second forward.  Even if they do adjust it should still prevent the opposition from pressing quite as intensely for fear of getting caught out by a long ball.

Last week, Begovic's performance probably prevented an even faker result, but it couldn't make Chelsea's unbelievably non-existent defense any less real.


Though City's looked good, they've benefited from Pulis's mistaken game planning and Mourniho's delusions (Chelsea's defense needs a hell of lot more than one John Stones. I know they have Falcao, but as much as he'll weigh them down, he isn't the true anchor they needed).


I'm not convinced yet Yaya (still loaffing for stretches) and Kompany (still forcing his confidence) are 'back'. Their defense hasn't really been tested (there's a reason they dropped the amount they did for Otamendi...), and I'm fairly certain Hart is off his meds. Kolarov's been great going forward, but tracking back the smokes must be catching up with him. Sterling hasn't been convincing and is still missing sitters. Navas's sole purpose in life is to pass the ball to Silva or Aguero. They'll see our Yarmolenko cock-tease and raise us a De Bruyne blue-balling... 



Point is: they have issues too, despite the adorable efforts of their pint-sized Spanish/Argentine attacking combo; the teams they've played have simply had more.

I can't think of anything more irresponsible than doing something illegal. By definition something that is illegal is also irresponsible, but I digress.

Ideally no one should suffer, but that isn't a feasible ideal to maintain or govern towards.

-Alli seems the more attacking of the two and also more creative. When we asked Nabil to link play against United, it started off smooth but got really ugly midway through the first half. The couple of matches I saw of him, Alli looks willing to do something only really Mason does with some regularity, which is switch the fucking ball to the opposite wing and make space for our central attackers.  

-They both take care of the ball, generally speaking and both are big and physical enough to deal with most PL outfits. 

Idk it just seems like both their strengths fit the others deficiencies. All that being said, there is still a lot to learn about Alli. I don't think it's necessarily outrageous to see a situation years from now where both players are world class.

Not necessarily. It's no good simply assuming that other industries will magically spring up in their place. When economies collapse, things tend not to miraculously spring up in their place. Look at Argentina. They used to have a strong economy, but they still haven't recovered from the collapse of the 90s. Or look at Greece. We might not starve, but might instead be left with a moribund economy where people need to move abroad to find decent work.

Don't assume that things can't get much worse here. They can.

That's an interesting point, it is an arbitrary line in the sand. Would our arguments change if the numbers were changed? And should any children be subsidised? Perhaps not. I wonder how much could be siphoned to education or care centres if no children were subsidised. Could it mean free university and would it lead to a more communal upbringing or destroy the traditional home life? Its an interesting thought experiment but moot in the end. The proposed law is three so I think the discussion should focus on that.

&gt;
I think that the subsidy helped people feel financially secure enough to have children.

Well, that's rather the point isn't it? Should people feel financially secure enough to have children without preparing? I honestly don't think they should. Further more, why should they? If they aren't financially secure to have children there might be more thought put into having children. And if an accident happens it will be subsidised. And if another accident happens it will be subsidised. And if a third accident happens they really should try a different technique than pulling out.

It's the lying adverts that bother me and waste my time. I once needed an unfurnished place, was promised that all the furniture there belonged to the tenant and would be gone. LIES. When I moved in, they told me it all belonged to the landlord and I would lose my deposit if I got rid of it. So I was stuck with all my furniture, and all of his. The landlord was very unpleasant to talk to about it too.  I made the best of the situation and put what I could into storage. 

That place caused me so much trouble. The one saving grace was that the agency fucked up big time towards the end of the lease and forgot to communicate to me that the landlord was taking back the flat. It caused the landlord a ton of problems, as even though I was moving anyway, legally I didn't have to move by the date he needed to be in by. 

However, a few days after I moved out I walked by the flat and noticed all his furniture out in the footpath ready for the council to take away. Assholes.

Honestly, I'm by no means a natural supporter of Mensch, but I think she's been doing a great job.  I also liked her reporting on the Tim Hunt fiasco.

Edit:  And of course - instadownvoted by the Corbynistas.  They don't want debate - they want their critics to shut up.  

Edit II:  Since people will inevitably hate-read the most downvoted comment:  What Mensch has been doing for the past few days is to highlight again and again that Corbyn supporters include a number of antisemites, who support him because they think he will stick it to the Jews.  And it's always Corbyn supporters.  This isn't happening with the supporters of any other Labour candidate.  Mensch has also written [blogposts](http://unfashionista.com) helping to expose Corbyn's links to antisemitism.  Is Corbyn himself an antisemite?

These people reflect the view of labour in the country much more than a few hundred MPS that were ushered in during the new labour era.

Their views are completely mainstream big tent labour values. The idea that if you vote green or even stand as a green you could never rejoin the labour party is ludicrous. In the same way that the average UKIP voter is someone the Tories will be expecting to return to the fold at some point.

And what exactly is wrong with them? I want you to tell me.

Can you honestly look at the UKIP manifesto and dismiss it all as rubbish? It's true that I don't agree with everything UKIP says (for example, they are deluded about climate change), but the vast majority of it is perfectly sensible.

Let's pick some policies from the manifesto...

 - Free tuition for STEM subjects in university, which is exactly what this country needs to stay competitive with Germany, America and Japan. 
 - Abolishing inheritance tax, which is really quite important for people who live in London, considering the insane house prices.
 - Ensure big corporations pay their fair share of tax
 - Invest an extra £1.5 billion into mental health and dementia services over the next five years
 - Introduce a flexible state pension window so you can still take a slightly lower state pension at age 65 even as the state pension age increases 
 - Crack down on benefit fraud
 - Stop child benefit being paid to children who don’t live here permanently and limit child benefit to two children for new claimants
 - Build one million homes on brownfield sites by 2020 &lt;- this is actually unrealistic
 - Support renewable energy where it can deliver electricity at competitive prices 
 - End the abuse of zero-hours contracts
 - Change the remit of the Competition Commission so dairy farmers get a fair price for milk 
 - Triple the maximum jail sentences for animal cruelty and torture 
 - Impose lifetime bans on animal care and ownership for anyone convicted of animal cruelty 
 - Ban the export of live animals for slaughter
 - Scrap our opt-in to the European Arrest Warrant and uphold the principle of ‘innocent until proven guilty’ 
 - Take a zero-tolerance approach to unacceptable ‘cultural’ practices such as female genital mutilation (FGM)
 - Decriminalise non-payment of the BBC licence fee and review its cost with a view to its reduction.
 - Genuinely debate petitions gathering over 100,000 signatures in the House of Commons
 - Introduce a new proportional voting system that truly reflects the number of votes cast 
 - Keep Council Tax as low as possible
 - Uphold freedom of speech within the law
 - Protect religious freedom but refuse to condone faiths which are intolerant of or refuse to respect the human rights of others 
 - Consult Parliament before committing our armed forces and taxpayers’ money to combat situations 
 - Encourage peace efforts in the Middle East and support a peaceful two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.

Sounds a bit left-wing, no?

That's my point. You cannot say UKIP is on the right because while they might be economically, socially we're a huge mix of liberals, libertarians, conservatives etc. It's really quite refreshing.

I joined UKIP because I want to leave the EU. I want *our* country to make it's own laws rather than annoying ""Accept cookies"" popups on every bloody website we visit, the EU telling us where we can't smoke, the trade agreements like TTIP that we should accept, the EU telling us what we can and can't do and ordering us around like the authoritarian Labour and Tories.

Besides, it's working, productive people who keep the economy running, not some shareholders and landlords reaping profits on top.

I completely agree. I'm certainly no Thatcherite. I'm in favour of new approaches like rent controls and heavy taxes on large landowners and buy to let landlords, as well as state ownership of vital utilities like waterand the railways.

&gt; Maybe, but I'd rather we tried to change things because we all know things are unfair and aren't getting any better.

It won't be a good thing if those changes bring us to a system which is even worse for ordinary people.

&gt; I'm just voting in my own interest, and if millions of others did, Corbyn (or someone even farther economically left) would win with a landslide.

Far left countries don't have a good track record of providing for the needs of their people. The ones who do tend to be more moderate social democratic countries like in Scandinavia. Corbyn is way to the left of these places. The idea that someone even further to the left of Corbyn would be good for ordinary people is ridiculous.

&gt; This is nothing to do with welfare or entitlement, the system itself is broken. Those who make the most money don't earn it, and the wealthiest just profit off the work of others be it via rent, dividends, or other means.

The system is far from broken. It's imperfect and there are a lot of problems that need to be solved, but that doesn't mean that you throw the baby out with the bathwater. You'll also find unfairness in any economic system. A better question to ask is whether or not the alternatives will do a better job of providing for the needs of the people than the current model.

Your entire post *reeks* of this Thatcherite ""Socialists just live off of other's hard work"" bullshit, I've no time for it.

I'm suggesting a few things. The main one is worker and trade union representation on company boards. This is not hugely controversial, has been done before in other successful countries like Germany and Sweden, and has proven positive results. This is the most fundamental change I want to see. It is an eminently just and fair proposal for those that believe workers should have a stake in their workplaces, and for those who believe democracy has a place in our economy.

But we should also offer *incentives* to companies willing to move to a broader co-operative structure along the lines of John Lewis, where each worker has shares in the company and policies in place to create a link between company and employee and to promote the success of both. We should also offer financial and legal assistance to individuals and groups of people who are interested in setting up their own co-operatively run businesses, offer them advice and guidance on how to do that.",null,0,null,1440192527,null,null,false,0,cub4yjz,null,t3_3huz8x,null,null,null,t1_cub3szl,null,null,null,1441392570,null,-2,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,-2,null

No, because there's a disclaimer which tells you the people and quotes aren't real. There's smallprint telling you the sample size when they tell you 90% of women loved it. There are standards that **advertising** has to stick to.

For Web Dev, the front end would be using Html, CSS, JavaScript, etc to code the layout of the website. Site navigation, text, pictures, and button placement all things a front end developer would be responsible for. Pretty much creating the whole GUI(graphical user interface) layout. 

The back end, as the name implies, is what's on the backside of interface. The code behind that the user does not directly interact with. Specifically it would include things like setting up a database or even configuring the server. For backend Web Dev , a lot of people use MySQL for their database and code with PHP. You can set up a server using APACHE on any Linux OS. Or find a company online to host your website.

Situation: random exotic derivatives trading desk making £100m per year, the star trader gets a £20m annual bonus.

Problem: new maximum wage means you can only pay him £100,000, and he's going to leave to a US-run Cayman Islands based hedge fund instead.  The UK-based business stands to lose £100 per year.

Solution: create Exotic Derivatives Ltd, with Mr. Star Trader owning 20%, the profits accumulate in the company.  After five years, company buys back the 20%, Mr. Star Trader now has £100m in cash even though he only earned £100,000 each year.

You can't have a maximum wage without enforcing a maximum return-on-investment.  Or classifying sale-of-assets as income.

If say, every baseball team that has ever won a World Series has had a combined team WAR (Wins Above Replacement -- baseballs end-all-be-all statistic) over 70, then you should assemble your team is such a way to get that desired stat. The EG metric is fairly predictive, but also not perfect.  It doesn't account for individual players, true, but that flaw only matters if a player is particularly good. Messi is one such player.

You might feel OK taking the decision to release your data, but subsequently that choice would be unavailable to your descendants; the data would already have been made available.  
  
The merits of different pricing mechanisms for insurance is a distraction from the focus of this thread.  
  
The concern is that any decision to release such potentially sensitive data ought to require commensurate consideration, and the systems for storage and access of this information should be very robust.  
  
Insurance was a single example to demonstrate a point. You have an opinion about it, others may have an opposite point of view. There are grounds for debate there and that ought to happen prior to release of data.  
  
The consequences of releasing this data could extend into a whole variety of domains in the future. People ought to have a chance to consider such possibilities before making the decision. Here are some other areas in which there might be repercussions: Law, Education and Terrorism.  
  
**Law**  
  
In the future, your records might show that you have a particular variant of red-headedness (!) which is associated with a propensity for violence. This might be introduced as evidence against you in a court of law.  
  
**Education**  
  
When a school is oversubscribed and other means to select successful applicants have all been exhausted, details from your medical records, such as brain size, might be used for or against you or your children.  
  
**Terrorism**  
  
Terrorist might wish to target individuals or a particular ethnic group. By examining the medical records, it could be established that a particular biological pathogen might be used to target your ethnic group.

I've done that a few times and I'm fairly sure looking back on it that I was over the limit. 

I seriously think its the adverts that have made it a taboo, they put them on during kids and teenagers TV shows so before you're even drinking *or* driving you're seeing them [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEVbSB2vz_8) one is particularly memorable.

Also, I think a decent part of it is that people are drinking long before most people can drive, so you get used to having to go out without a car from a young age, also part of it is that our towns are more compact so you basically never have to drive or taxi between bars like you often do in the US.

Newhaven to Dieppe is 4 hours. You can get a late night boat and treat it as your kip if you're really keen. 

On the French side the roads are so nice and quiet anyway you won't feel like you need cycle paths, Just stick to back roads or take the Avenue Verte http://avenuevertelondonparis.co.uk.

Alternatively, South Downs Way if you've got a MTB or hybrid. Brighton to Hastings on cycle paths is superbe. Or The Viking Way near Margate. http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/cycle-the-north-thanet-coast.

I don't buy that at all, and I think they're way *way* over-hyped. I've given my opinion of them before, and I essentially think they're the Simpson's Comic Book Guy version of an ISP. Zen is a much better ISP - they can provide you with a /29 network, have good tech support (i.e. they trust you know how to configure a router yourself), but alas do have a cap of a few 100GB.

Also, A&amp;A have absolutely no capital infrastructure to speak of. They might have a few core routers dotted around, but when it comes to it they use TalkTalk and BT Wholesale for their backhaul and Openreach for the local loop. They're as much an ISP as Gregs The Baker or the Post Office are.

There are literally dozens of ISPs out there that offer unlimited packages (either 'truly' unlimited, with a fair-use policy, or just traffic-shaping between certain hours). The ones that do traffic shaping tend to offer the best service IMO.

For example, BT (Retail) offer unlimited broadband, so do EE, the Post Office, Sky, and TalkTalk. Virgin Media don't.

I didn't make that claim.

What I do claim, and with some confidence, is that leftist antisemites are flocking to Corbyn, and no other candidate.  The evidence is pretty clear.

Oh, and I'm also happy to claim that Corbyn has a long history of associating with antisemites and looking the other way when it comes to their bigotry.  And that this behavior is almost certainly what's drawing the support from antisemites.

&gt;How many anti-Semitic Labour voters do you think there are?

I don't think it's insignificant.  Go look at [Mensch's twitter feed](https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch)- she's been able to find many many examples.

As I said elsewhere, I think it falls short of a scientific study, but I also think it's a genuine effect.  I've seen it myself - and you can verify it for yourself by using relevant search-terms in the twitter search to find antisemitic comments related to the Labour leadership election.  It's not difficult and it's not a secret that it's happening.

&gt;No one on twitter is even verified - any random tweets of that nature could be written by crazy people or by people who wanted to smear Corbyn.

Nah.  You can look at their histories - these comments are not dominated by new accounts.  They're real opinions from real Corbyn supporters.

&gt;Would you consider it reasonable if I found some comments by Jews on twitter saying we should destroy Palestine, and then tried to link them to the state of Israel itself?

Well no, because Jews and the state of Israel are two separate things.  However, if you were able to find a constant stream of genocidal comments from a group of Israelis then I wouldn't think it ludicrous to make a fuss about it.

null,null,NervousEnergy,null,null,null,"This kind of hits home for me because I suffer from ASD too, and at times really considered trying to get onto DLA or PIP. I can function as a member of society now (just about) but the symptoms of ASD are still there and if I let them control me it would be *frightfully* difficult to hold down any kind of job. And yet to look and interact with me in public, you would be hard pressed to diagnose me with anything. It bubbles away just under the surface.

If you're not in his head, and as you don't seem to know him that closely, you can't really understand what life might *really* be like for him. What if he suffers dreadfully internally? You say he spends most of his time at home all day.. for all you know he could be sobbing his eyes out in fits of severe depression (like I was). I'm not saying he isn't cheating the system.. but what if he isn't?  

If he does claim ESA or PIP or one of the other disability-related benefits; he must have had evidence from his GP that his condition is bad enough to present him from working. The DWP really does make it hard to get onto these programmes without concrete evidence. I got clients (I now work as an employability advisor) with **severe** disabilities who are routinely refused to go off JSA. 

Honestly; with a benefits system you should accept the fact that some people are going to abuse it. Is it really worth the effort of tracking down and punishing all these people who do abuse it? It's a minuscule percentage of the entire claimants, and I really believe that the obsession with the ""scroungers"" is doing far more harm than good. It taints **all** valid claimants when people start questioning the integrity and truthfulness of your circumstances. 

And let's say you report him and he really is defrauding the system. That doesn't really gain anything apart from grabbing back a tiny bit of tax payers money and clearing your conscience. And yet, if he *does* have a severity of ASD that effects his ability to work; your reporting him might just make a vulnerable person's life *just that little bit more hellish*. Is it worth it?

You would have to change the law to force companies to *never* hire any temporary or contract staff, and that would include their accountants etc. It would be a nightmare - you would have to do *everything* in house. What if you found asbestos at your place of business - instead of hiring a contractor, you would be forced to take on an asbestos person as a permanent member of staff to your IT business! 

Also, mass outsourcing *isn't* that expensive if you cut salaries. In the first scenario the cleaner goes from an above minimum wage situation to a minimum wage situation - the business is probably paying the same to the cleaning agency, but the cleaner gets less, and the agency gets the difference. So Corbyn's plan would make business owners richer at the expense of workers.

&gt;Your Dublin Scenario is just a bit bizzare TBH.

The fact is, wealthy British people like living in the UK, especially London. With a very few exceptions, they did so even during the days when tax rates were 90%+.

First of all, it wouldn't be the individuals making the decision but the business - as in ""we're moving all your functions to Dublin, and if you don't want to relocate, here's your redundancy notice"". Corporation tax is only 12.5% in Ireland, so being nudged by Corbyn to move all their higher functions plus corporate HQ there would really benefit them - at the expense of the UK treasure. Again Corbyn making businesses richer at the expense of staff thanks to his idiocy.

I've seen it myself - and you can verify it for yourself by using relevant search-terms in the twitter search to find antisemitic comments related to the Labour leadership election. It's not difficult and it's not a secret that it's happening.

And how do you know who these people are? Are they genuine tweeters, are they genuine Labour supporters? Might they be part of a lobby designed to discredit Corbyn or Labour? Are they just cranks?

Claiming it falls short of a scientific study is a joke. It's not even close.

&gt;Nah. You can look at their histories - these comments are not dominated by new accounts. They're real opinions from real Corbyn supporters.

See above, although examples of this flood of anti-Semitism would be appreciated. 

&gt;Well no, because Jews and the state of Israel are two separate things.

They are indeed. Which is interesting, because that seems to be a concept that pro-Israel lobby groups have trouble unpacking. Indeed, I think you know as well as I do that Corbyn's thoughts on the Middle East will almost certainly relate to Israeli policy and not the Jewish people, and yet you are the one chucking anti-Semitism in to the debate.

&gt;However, if you were able to find a constant stream of genocidal comments from a group of Israelis then I wouldn't think it ludicrous to make a fuss about it.

There are plenty. I've been involved in plenty of debates on the ME where the view of some Israelis goes as far as calling for genocide, but you know what? I separate that from the Israeli state and Jewish people in general because they are, more than likely, just cranks. Maybe you should do the same.

null,null,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,null,"&gt;This is MONUMENTALLY stupid though

It really isn't though. There's a lot of leading economists who support the idea of a national maximum wage, and countries with excessively high income taxation at the highest levels like Finland haven't had so much capital flight that it seriously adversely effects their countries. 

Additionally, what are having all these big multi-national corporations in our country actually good for? Most of them don't even pay tax (or their employees..) and so just use services paid for by the rest of the tax payers. It's not like the small amount of capital flight this will create is lost revenue anyway, given that most of them only pay the 20 odd percent for dividends taxes, rather than the 45 percent top rate. 

In the absence of any of the good things these top execs and CEOs do, here's a list of positive things that a national maximum wage will produce. 

1) to limit inflation - Corbyn wants a ""people's quantitative easing"" which is known to cause a lot of inflation. Setting a maximum top wage is just sound economic sense. Otherwise all of the money would just lose value and it'd be for nothing. 

2) It improves the health of society. There's a lot of research which has been done that indicates quite strongly that more equal societies are more healthy across every part of society.

Yeah, I doubt that these people are all conservatives in disguise.  Isn't the simplest explanation the most likely one?  That Corbyn's support of antisemites is attracting supporters who are also antisemites.

&gt;See above, although examples of this flood of anti-Semitism would be appreciated.

I've linked to it multiple times now, but maybe you missed it.  Go look at [Louise Mensch's twitter feed](https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch).

&gt;Indeed, I think you know as well as I do that Corbyn's thoughts on the Middle East will almost certainly relate to Israeli policy and not the Jewish people, and yet you are the one chucking anti-Semitism in to the debate.

Um, because actual antisemites and holocaust deniers are expressing support for Corbyn.  This has nothing to do with Israel and it certainly has nothing to do with my feelings on Israel - which are at best ambivalent.  

&gt;I've been involved in plenty of debates on the ME where the view of some Israelis goes as far as calling for genocide

Don't care.  This is side-tracking.

As for Iraq,  I held a similar position to you before the second resolution wasn't passed, then I very quickly woke up to what was going on.  I understand the strong feelings on the Kurdish genocide (Oona King supported the war essentially on that point) but that was a long time before 03, and in between there had been sanctions and a few aitstrikes.  The Iraq war itself was premised on false information, which it's clear to me at least Blair knew to be at the very least shaky. Regime change constitutes an illegal war,  that isn't the defence to drop back on, and it certainly wasn't the argument at the time.  At the very least you have to see what very quickly followed the invasion was catastrophic, and involved a sickening amount of corruption and profiteering.  ISIS has lead directly from Al Quida in Iraq, itself a result of the chaos and deBaathification that followed the invasion.  The UK and the US fucked up,  Labour fucked up (even just strategically by drawing resources from Afghanistan)  we have to recognise that.

I never said they were Conservatives. There are other lobbies in operation.

Put simply, no.

This is like evidencing that the holocaust was make-believe by reference David Irving. Just provide me with some actual links, so I don't have to trawl her rubbish.

&gt;Um, because actual antisemites and holocaust deniers are expressing support for Corbyn.

They also express support for other political parties. So what?

&gt;Don't care. This is side-tracking.

It's not side-tracking at all. It's raising a comparative scenario. Namely, that you can't just tar everyone in a certain camp with the same brush just because there's some nutters in it.

If it was that simple to start and establish a business, everyone would be doing it and everyone would be rich.

Like I said, there are no legal obstacles to starting a business. Why don't you give it a try. Set up say a manufacturing business. Design a product, patent it, raise the finance, organise the staff, do the marketing, build a brand, sweat blood trying to get the product into the shops -  and then say ""It's the staff that's done all the hard work, that cleaning lady is really the source of success the way she pushes the hoover at night, I'll hand over all the profits to her"".

The reality is that people get paid according to their contribution - so the engineer that will design patentable products will get paid more than the cleaner. And the person with the balls to start the company in the first place and sweat blood trying to raise finance to pay the staff in those months before the revenue starts to flow has made the biggest contribution of all, by having the nerve to create the business in the first place.

Like I said - if you think it's so easy, how about you lead the way. Instead of saying ""the government should do this"", the bosses should do that"", how about YOU start a co-op and show everyone how it's done. In the early days of the Labour movement in the 19th century people did just that - now Labour has turned into a bunch of whiny people like you who want *someone else* to set it up and you are getting all huffy because they don't want to share with your sorry self.

Continue like that and watch how business reacts. Cleaner moaning about pushing the hoover - abolish her and get one of those robot hoovers that you just set and program. Tube drivers going on strike, just get those driverless trains to replace them.  People giving you hassle at work? Just automate.

Did you know that our manufacturing output is 10 times what it was in the 1950's but staff in manufacturing is 1/100th of what it was? That's because robots have replaced people. And business got pushed into it by people like you.

To paraphrase you, It's not the boss doing the hard work, it's the robots. Robots create the value in the business and they don't need to share in the profits.

Got to agree on that last part- I did read a year or so ago about the university that actually trialled a 'tee total area' in their student union, with some really positive results. I was also involved in both the Christian Union and a RPG gaming group which really put the social focus away from drinking. With the CU it was meals out and stuff like going to a theme park and whatever, whilst with my RPG group the activities generally involved a lot of food rather than everyone getting hammered (usually pizza).

I think that he's an old-time Marxist lefty who has the usual prejudices of Marxist lefties against the big bad imperialist West.

Ideological thinking is weird - it can get perfectly nice decent people to accept all sorts of nonsense and excuse any amount of evil - as long as its in the cause of reducing cognitive dissonance.  To an extent we all suffer from it - and I'm certainly not immune to biases.  But, Corbyn is likely further in than most, having spent decades as a hard-left rebel.

I work in the BT cancellations team. A new tenant taking a service should have **no** impact on your cancellation whatsoever. If a new person was taking out services on your line after you have arranged to cancel, then your line would just show up on the system as ""*Pending Stop*"".

The new tenant can request whatever date they want for their service to start, but if your line is still active then this would trigger a letter to come out to you, giving you the choice to allow the takeover or block it (for example, if they tried to takeover the line before you were moving out). If you don't contact BT then it goes ahead. If you say no, then the takeover is cancelled and the new person will have to arrange another takeover order.

I honestly don't know what happened that meant that someone actively contacted you to tell you that a new tenant is essentially being given priority over you - but they are wrong.

Call 0800 800 150 and get through to the Customer Options Team (easiest way is to use the word ""cancel""). They are a UK based team who are trained in home-moves and cancellations. If they can't sort it sufficiently then email a summary of the issue to gavin.patterson@bt.com to be contacted by the ELC (Executive Level Complaints) team. Emailing ""elc@bt.com"" is **not** the correct way to go about this and the issue may not be picked up.

Edit: In reference to other comments in this thread, do **not** contact the ombudsman unless a) BT have not resolved the issue after 6 weeks, or b) a manager at BT has issued you with a Deadlock Letter. The ombudsman will not even so much as look at a complaint if either of these 2 things haven't happened. Using the word ""ombudsman"" to get results therefore does not work.

null,null,SoyBeanExplosion,,Labour | Co-op | Fabians,null,"&gt;The reality is that people get paid according to their contribution - so the engineer that will design patentable products will get paid more than the cleaner. 

This is utter bollocks. This doesn't make sense *even looking at it through a capitalist perspective*. Seriously, you need to get your background knowledge sorted before you start challenging me on this shit. Even if we disregard the LTV, and assuming a relatively competitive economy, wages have nothing to do with some objective measure of contribution, they're about supply and demand within the industry. Engineers are paid more because there's fewer of them and higher demand for the few that we do have, because it's more difficult to become one as it's a more challenging profession in itself. The supply of engineers is relatively inelastic because it's not easy to just become an engineer, it takes qualifications, studying, etc. And each engineer has the potential to create a lot of value. The supply of cleaners is highly elastic because there are so many people who can do that job as it requires so few qualifications.

Nonetheless I think it's important that all workers have a stake in the business they work in. That doesn't mean you bring the cleaner in to the board meeting and give her a veto, it just means that, like Germany and Sweden, you give them and the unions qualified representation on the boards. Then you don't need any heavy-handed statist intervention further down the road.

&gt;Design a product, patent it, raise the finance, organise the staff, do the marketing, build a brand, sweat blood trying to get the product into the shops - and then say ""It's the staff that's done all the hard work, that cleaning lady is really the source of success the way she pushes the hoover at night, I'll hand over all the profits to her"".

You're thinking in Thatcherite terms. Everything you're saying tells me you're probably a Tory, am I wrong? From a socialist (Labour) perspective, the questions you should be asking about that situation are these: Did I do the marketing or did I hire someone to do the marketing for me? Did I raise the finance or did I hire an accountant and a secretary to help with the financial side of things? Did I organise the staff or did I employ someone else to do that? Did I do everything on my own from start to finish or is the reality that it was a team effort and I cannot take sole credit and profit from its success?

&gt;Like I said - if you think it's so easy, how about you lead the way. Instead of saying ""the government should do this"", the bosses should do that"", how about YOU start a co-op and show everyone how it's done. In the early days of the Labour movement in the 19th century people did just that - now Labour has turned into a bunch of whiny people like you who want someone else to set it up and you are getting all huffy because they don't want to share with your sorry self.

This is utterly absurd. You're living in some alternative reality where people haven't set up and tried the co-op model yet. In *this* reality, John Lewis and Waitrose are highly successful businesses. Turnover increases year-on-year (£10.2bn in 2013-2014) and with the exception of 2013-2014 profits have also risen year-on-year, directly linked to the bonuses that regular employees receive. The Co-operative Group has turnover of about £10.8bn too, and [this site](http://www.uk.coop/economy2015/uk-co-operative-economy-2015-report) has a chart showing the most successful co-ops, turning over many hundreds of millions of pounds every year. The Mondragon Corporation is one of the most successful businesses in Spain, and in France the Crédit Agricole Group,  Groupe Caisse D’Epargne, and  	Confédération Nationale du Crédit Mutuel alone bring in about $200bn every year.

&gt;Cleaner moaning about pushing the hoover - abolish her and get one of those robot hoovers that you just set and program. Tube drivers going on strike, just get those driverless trains to replace them. People giving you hassle at work? Just automate.

These things are going to happen anyway, this is how technology progresses, it's a historical inevitability, and it's one thing capitalism is very bad at addressing.

Almost all of his great moments have come when he's found himself in the center.  And I'll be honest, I think he's actually a more creative passer than Eriksen is.  They're the reverse of what we expected: Eriksen is actually better at beating a defender on the dribble, and better at putting the ball in the net, while Lamela has been the more creative (sometimes too creative for his own teammates, in truth).

You make a good point about Eriksen being better on the left than Lamela on the right.  Eriksen actually gives us more width on the left (and is much more two-footed) than Lamela does on the right, and has proven much more effective as a winger than Lamela has.

The problem is that Eriksen's defensive work on the left is poor, from what I recall.  He's good on the forward press, but he doesn't track back well.  Then again, Chadli doesn't either, so maybe we're not losing much in that sense.  Lamela tracks back like a rabid dog (for better or worse).

null,null,RifleEyez,null,null,null,"&gt;Almost all of his great moments have come when he's found himself in the center. And I'll be honest, I think he's actually a more creative passer than Eriksen is. They're the reverse of what we expected: Eriksen is actually better at beating a defender on the dribble, and better at putting the ball in the net, while Lamela has been the more creative (sometimes too creative for his own teammates, in truth).

I'm tempted to agree here. You think of Eriksen as the technical little number 10 in the hole, and Lamela as the inverted winger. Eriksen beats defenders out wide quite a lot, especially with his trademark disguised-scoop-pass-thing (i'm sure fifa kids have a name for this). 

I mean, Lamela isn't exactly ''slow''.  I remember before he joined us Zeman had them doing sprints at Roma and his time was ridiculous. But you're right, Lamela isn't quite a ''toe punt it and speed past defenders and cut inside'' like Bale type of player, he's more of a 'mock' RW who naturally drifts into the centre. His goal vs Burnley was awesome though.

&gt;And I'll be honest, I think he's actually a more creative passer than Eriksen is

[Just watch this little clip. Totally sums up what you're saying. Oh, he's central here too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEaAFxwyBqo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m3s). Even the next clip after that is through the centre, *again*, which resulted in a goal. I think Erik is WAY more creative than he's given credit for, and that would be much more useful in the AMC position.

Literally, ignoring his time at River playing there and Roma, whenever you watch Lamela for us on those compilations, just take note of how much more dangerous he is whenever it's in the central areas. It's crazy.

Plus, his defensive workrate would be great for pressing the defenders and putting them under pressure with the support of 2 CM's behind him.

null,null,MadArend,num20,,null,"Agree with everything you said here.

&gt; The issue is really, who do we leave out and how do they all fit? Chadli has made himself relatively undroppable, Eriksen HAS to be on the pitch and if Erik is at AMC then he's gonna be on the left. With the Dembele experiment on the right, and Njie (weak left foot IIRC) and Berahino (scores much more with his right), I'm not sure how it will work.

It's probably down to game-by-game tactics.  I really don't know enough about N'Jie or Berahino (or whomever we bring in) to comment on them.  I will say that I like Dembele at CAM more than out wide, and honestly, when I've seen him beat defenders at the byline and come round into the box for a cross, it's actually been on the *left* side of the box, not the right.  But his dribbling and shooting ability (which he's finally starting to use this season, surely by demand of the coach) are most devastating around the top of the box.

I think Chadli is good on the right (he's gotten better at it while he's been here), and he's a massively underrated dribbler.  When he's in the mood, he absolutely destroys defenders and makes them look foolish.

Also, Kane likes to pull wide to the right to create space for Eriksen and Chadli, and he does it brilliantly.

So for me, we have (in alphabetical order)...

our most creative players:

* Eriksen
* Lamela
* Kane

our best runners/dribblers:

* Chadli
* Dembele
* Kane
* (Townsend?)

and our best forward pressers:

* Dembele
* Eriksen
* Kane
* (Lamela?)

So the combination we play should depend on whom we're facing.  There's enough width in each category (or enough of each category capable of playing wide) to mix and match based on opposition.  (edit: Plus, we're going to need as many quality lineups as we can muster when we get to the later stages of the cup competitions, so having league matches in which we can leave a player like Chadli, or Lamela, or Dembele, or even Eriksen, on the bench, is great news.)

What we're short on is pace, though with N'Jie in the fold, we could play him and Townsend on the flanks if we wanted to go full-out flying wingers.

EDIT: for instance, if we wanted our most creative lineup, we'd go

                        Kane
                Eriksen Lamela Chadli

with Kane pulling out to the right when Chadli makes a run into the middle, and with Chadli and Eriksen occasionally swapping wings. ",null,0,null,1440205508,null,null,1440206158,0,cubc4gz,null,t3_3huogt,null,null,null,t1_cubbfxc,null,null,null,1441396012,null,1,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

null,null,Collosis,null,null,null,"I feel I should preface with what I'm about to say with a few things.  Firstly a summary of why stocks are the best long term investment, if going by a single asset class, rather than property is something that smarter people with more experience than me write hundred page essays on so my version will be woefully simplistic.  Similarly there will be a lot of false assumptions for simplicity.  Also pretend that London property isn't being considered - that's a whole oddity in itself with other rare factors at play.

Imagine an economy in 1950 with 10 people and 10 houses for them to live in.  Each house costs £100.  By 1990 technology has surged ahead, as has the population.  Now 20 people want to inhabit homes but the availability of prime location land is limited, so 10 more homes are built to accommodate them.  The original 10 homes in the ""better"" location may be worth more (assuming they are the same quality).  Counterbalancing this, the houses can be built more cheaply than the houses that existed in 1950 due to the technological expansion.  The net increase in house prices is mediocre, maybe £105 per house.  The only reason you may read that and think ""my nan bought her house in 1970 and now it's worth 20 times that"" is because of inflation; the purchasing power she could get by selling the house in 1970 compared to 2015 is not hugely different.

Now imagine the same economy with 10 people in 1950.  A company makes bicycles for them to ride which each person needs to buy 1 of each year (just go with it).  The company sells the bike for £10 and it costs them £9 to make.  The company sells 10 bikes for £100 revenue and has £90 of costs; £10 profit for the year.

Now it's 1990 and there are 20 people.  The technological surge, the lower average cost (making 20 bikes per year still only requires 1 accountant so the cost of employing him/her is split more) &amp; improved innovation (this company and its staff have been perfecting how to make bikes for years) means it only costs £2 to make a bike.  The company can't still sell the bikes for £10 each since a competitor would jump in and undercut them.  However, the price doesn't need to fall as much as the cost does - this bit is super technical but lets just say that if bikes sell for only £3 when before they cost £10 the consumer will happily pay it, even if the company sells it for a 50% margin whereas they used to sell it for a 11% margin.  The company sells 20 bikes @ £3: £60 revenue, £40 costs, £20 profit.

As you can see from the ultra simple example, the improvement in technology, innovation and population size has caused profits at the company to double.  The property on the other hand has not seen the same improvements in value from these variables because it is not producing anything which can take advantage of these improvements.  The heightened profitability of companies is essentially what you are buying when you buy shares.  As above, if inflation comes in and causes the price of everything to uniformly double then they still sell 20 bikes except each one costs £4 to make and sells for £6.  Total profit is £40 (2 x 20) so any inflation will still feed through into higher-yet-not-real gains as was the case with the house.

You might point out that we've excluded the rental income you could get from the property but dividend income from the company has also been excluded.

Another thing to consider is the risk premium principle.  If you could lend money to someone who pays you 5% interest a year but might never pay you back, or lend at 5% interest to someone who would definitely pay you back, you would obviously lend to the latter.  You may however be unsure who you wanted to lend to if the former would pay you 20% interest a year.  In the same vein, the fact that the stock market can sometimes lose you 30% in a year whereas safer investments like property won't (2008 notwithstanding) means that people will only invest in stocks if they believe there is a better return to get in stocks than other assets.",null,0,null,1440207348,null,null,false,0,cubd2mr,null,t3_3hrzik,null,null,null,t1_cual144,null,null,null,1441396524,null,5,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,5,null

When first introduced (played by Roger Delgado) during The Third Doctor story ""Terror of the Autons"", he is already on his 13th life.

During The Five Doctors special, the Time Lords offer him a new set of regenerations if he cooperates with them, to which he agrees.

During the intro of the 1996 TV Movie, The 8th Doctor mentions that The Master (played by Gordon Tipple in the intro, and then by Eric Roberts) is on his last life when he's executed by the Daleks.

So already, that 26 confirmed deaths before we even get to the New Who series.

Between the '96 Movie and New Who, the Time Lords rescue The Master from the Eye of Harmony to fight in the Time War, and after that, the next time we see him is as Professor Yana (played by Derek Jacobi) in the episode ""Utopia"", so that a minimum of 1 more death and regeneration, because we don't know how many times he may have died during the Time War, at which point he is shot and regenerates into the John Simm incarnation, who dies in ""Last of the Time Lords"", is resurrected by a cult and dies again in ""The End of Time"".  So that's a minimum of 30 deaths right there.

The next time we see The Master is as Missy, but there is some speculation that [this screenshot](https://sp.yimg.com/ib/th?id=JN.iJ8vwFDZihQyTXpQ6sCNJg&amp;pid=15.1&amp;P=0&amp;w=300&amp;h=300) from ""Day of The Doctor"" is of Missy's hand as she escapes the Time War, so it's possible that the Michelle Gomez incarnation is actually between the Eric Roberts incarnation and the Derek Jacobi incarnation, because it hasn't been clarified (yet) if that was her first escape or her second, but it's more likely that it's after John Simm.",null,0,null,1440208140,null,null,false,0,cubdhn5,null,t3_3hx4fy,null,null,null,t3_3hx4fy,null,null,null,1441396721,null,17,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,17,null

Actually Al Queda was founded in the 1940's, it wasn't created by Iraq.

As for ISIS - it was created in 2012 (nearly a decade after the Iraq war) - and crucially it was created by Saudi and UAE in order to put pressure on Syria. So *nothing* to do with Iraq at all, it emerges first in Syria.

Why did Saudi want to create a terror group in Syria? Simple: pipelines. They had hoped to build a pipeline from Saudi through Syrian territory into Turkey and onto Europe. But the Iranians wanted to build another pipeline through Iraq, into Syria and into Turkey and onto Europe.

Assad of Syria being an Alawite, sided with the Shia Iranians and Iraqis and gave the greenlight for them to use his territory. The Saudis responded by sending in a terror group to topple him.

So neither Al Queda nor ISIS have *anything* to do with the war in Iraq. Yet people like Corbyn are pretending that it is and it's all our fault. Which neatly lets the Saudis off the hook...

The information I linked to indicates that this equality principle only counts for when your income is *over ~£20,000 per year*. All the information I've given only applies to the Western developed countries, namely, the OECD. Absolute standards matter, yes. The inequality indicators need to be tempered by absolute indicators, which they are. Eliminating inequality should only be a priority for countries once the overall majority of people have incomes of over the absolute poverty threshhold.

Additionally, I'm not even particularly arguing this from a Rawlsian perspective. My argument is that it's better for everybody in society, including the rich, where as Rawls has a preoccupation with the poor. There's certainly similarities, but we're not of the same mind.

Oh for fuck's sake. Now I've seen it all. ""The hero we needed""? Melodramatic enough? Can I get some more inferiority complex please?


**Dealing with players**

Lambert was dogshit at man-managing. It was no secret we wanted to offload Bent, Given, Ireland, Hutton and N'Zogbia. Cases can be made against the quality of all of these players, but there is no doubt they could have helped us at some point. Youth and inexperience was one of the biggest weaknesses of our squad as we routinely crumbled under pressure. Regardless, banishing the ""bomb squad"" to the reserves made very little sense. We needed these players in the shop window, not rotting away in the under-age teams. Banishing them ultimately had no effect, of course. All of those players continued to collected their exorbitant wages and saw out their contracts. Hilariously, Given and Hutton were eventually *reinstated* as assistant-manager and primary right-back, while Bent and N'Zogbia received clean slates in Lambert's third season. Begging the question, what the fuck was the point in shunning them 2 years ago?! It was an absolute shambles.


**Archaic tactics and horrendous results**


Lambert's first season left us all a nervous wreck. [[Continued...]](http://www.resavr.com/comment/paul-lambert--hero-1674681)

Or would you rather have everyone pay more income tax? which is a valid opinion.

Belgium have the highest rates in Europe, so lets take their model to make it fair. (Not that this would be your idea, but it's the only way I can see a restructuring of the tax bands with a higher rate)


    
|Annual income|	Tax rate
|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|
In between 0 € and 8680€ |	25%
In between €8680 and €12360|	30%
In between €12360 € and €20600|	40%
In between €20600 and €37750|	45%
In excess of €37750|	50%

Then lets add your 70% for over a million if we implement it in the UK.

If you earn the Median uk income of £26,500 you're take home pay is £21,107. With Belgiem's system it's [£16,762](http://contractortaxation.com/Belgium/Tax-Calculator-Belgium)

There are 18,000 people in the UK who have an income of over £1m, and 6,000 who earn over £2m(can't find the in between numbers). I'm sure those 12,000-odd people would find other ways to keep their salary under £1m. 

I prefer our current rate where the lowest earners pay no income tax. My yearly take home pay rose by a grand in the past 5 years which came in very handy when you're not on a lot.

Besides, some of the best moments on the show were when they were making corrections. Ie. Dara O'Briain and the triple point of water.

Though I understand why you'd get upset in that case, since they were factually incorrect. Especially since it's a matter of national pride. I remember one episode where they mentioned the RCMP, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which is our national police service. They're the equivalent of the FBI in the US. 

Anyway, David Mitchell had a crack at them, with the idea that all police officers in Canada are mounted, and they're always riding horses, in the office, the police cars are massive, ha ha, fucking Canada. I was genuinely annoyed by that. 'Royal Canadian Mounted Police' is just their name. They're not actually on horseback. I'm sure they're all trained in the use of horses, but as far as I know, they never use them outside of ceremonial duties.

Basically, it's the equivalent of me going on QI, them mentioning the national police service of Scotland Yard, and I popped up saying, ""What? Scotland Yard? So your national police only operate in Scotland? England, Ireland and Wales don't get anything? Ha ha! You stupid Brits!""

But neither the elves nor Stephen Fry were responsible, just David Mitchell, which makes him a dick.

So they linked Corby to China like this

'What's the connection between Corby and an enormous amount of porridge found on Mars?'
'""And in Corby, England, an Irishman, John Coyle, has won the world's porridge-eating championship by consuming twenty three bowls of instant oatmeal in a ten-minute time limit. Over.""

'There we were, in space, near Mars, on the crater Corby. Now, porridge was invented, in fact, in China: the city of Qian'an, spelled""Qi-an-an"", but pronounced ""Chi-nan"" in Chinese. About the same size as Corby'

And many - probably the majority - of British Jews have their identity very strongly associated with Israel, such that a criticism of Israel can feel anti-Semitic even when it isn't.

And in Canterbury, New Zealand, we have exactly this, right now. A subset of our medical records, stuff like long term illnesses, allergies, and prescription information is available to pharmacists, other doctors, and hospitals using a service that is now called HealthOne, but used to be called eSCRV, electronic shared case record view. By default we're all opted in to this system, but one can opt opt.

This system was set up after the Christchurch earthquakes, when it was discovered that having a lot of people needing urgent medical attention from unfamiliar practitioners was really hard due to no information.

The system tracks every access by every user, and to get to some parts of the record the user has to click a button which acknowledges they have a genuine need to see this information. This feature enables people to be sacked for browsing information they shouldn't, as happened to a bunch of people who thought they would ""just have a look"" at a well-known rugby player's records when he got admitted, and found themselves no longer employed.

I'm more of a privacy advocate than most, but on balance, the advantages of this system outweigh my privacy concerns.

&gt;1. banks

May as well get one now. 

&gt;2. Gowns


They are college-specific. About £40 for undergrad gowns. You might be able to get a second - hand one, they're one-size-fits-none. 

&gt;3. Gym

The uni sports centre is a spectacular gym. I actually cried a little bit when I first went in. It's about a 15 minute cycle from Pembroke. There's also a pure gym a little closer, but it's not as well equipped. Kelsey Kerridge is expensive and rubbish. Most college gyms are cheap and really, really bad (except Trinity and churchill). 

&gt;4. Linux

You should be fine. I think engineers mainly use matlab. The university has a total academic headcount license (i.e with a uni address, the most recent version is free), and that works on my Ubuntu boxes. 

&gt;5. Frying pan

Storing it is fine. The only problem is that a lot of college gyp rooms only have an induction hob (not sure about Pembroke). See if you can check that out beforehand. 

&gt;6. Storing food

For something like oats, there'd probably be space in your room if not the kitchen. Your limiting factor living in college is more likely to be fridge space: when I was gaining in first year I never had enough space for my milk, had to stock up on UHT and drink it out of the cupboard if I didn't want to go to the shop every day. 2L was fine, more than that was a struggle. 

&gt;7. Internships

You don't need to start looking now. Some people get them really last-minute, although midway through the year is probably the best time. 

&gt;8. Societies 

Not really sure about engineering societies. I recommend joining some non-engineering though! Cambridge can get stressful and it's best to get some time away from your subject. 

&gt;9. Things to do

Getting a bike is important. Learning to cook things on an induction hob if necessary.

There's also a huge difference in language that is being used to communicate a precise technical point (such as would be used in any engineering or indeed non-engineering profession) and the language that is used in general communication.

Obviously for anyone doing a job at Nasa (oh OK, then NASA!) it's of vital importance that everyone is always crystal clear about what's being discussed and that there are no ambiguities. After all, imagine what could happen if one team planned a spaceflight using metric units and another used imperial -- as if that would ever happen :-p

Anyway the point is that within NASA it's no surprise that there were lots of abbreviations and that the staff there always used them correctly. They're all in a situation where accurate communication is an absolute vital tool of the job.

On the other hand a casual reader of the BBC website is not going to cause hundreds of millions of dollars of spacecraft to crash if it takes him an extra second or so to parse ""Nasa"" rather than ""NASA"".
