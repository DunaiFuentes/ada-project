Instead of achieving that kind of distribution, a giant suction pump had by 1929-30 drawn into a few hands an increasing portion of currently produced wealth. This served them as capital accumulations. But by taking purchasing power out of the hands of mass consumers, the savers denied to themselves the kind of effective demand for their products that would justify a reinvestment of their capital accumulations in new plants. In consequence, as in a poker game where the chips were concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, the other fellows could stay in the game only by borrowing.

null,false,swug3,,Right Wing Conservative,null,"&gt; But the question is how much is that actually that women don't actually want to do these jobs, and how much is just that women don't feel they could be able to go into these jobs as they believe its a man's job?

That isn't the question, the question is why do we focus on one thing being gender equal but not another, if people want equality, they have to have it across the board, or they will be (in my eyes at least) massive hypocrites.

&gt; The problem is that prejudiced attitudes tend to be self-reinforcing. If we just let the status quo be, then it reinforces the current trend and then people think ""well politics isn't a woman's job"", so woman are discouraged from going into politics, which thus reinforces the belief that its a men's only job.

It's funny, because a lot of issues that affect men more, i.e. Male suicide rates are barely even talked about by the politicians. Politicians rarely care for all the demographics, they only care for the demographics who vote for them and the demographics they will most likely be able to sway. That's why the main topics will always be- Economy, Defence, Social policy, not Gender equality or male issues because the majority of voters don't care about that.

&gt; In an ideal world, these statements wouldn't need to be made - you're right, it shouldn't matter. But because we are a country that has a history of oppressing women and minorities, there are social attitudes that have been ingrained into society, which bias women against taking jobs they believe to be ""men's only"" and biases employers/the public into thinking that women shouldn't be doing these jobs.

As was most of the world up until about the late 1970's. The same could be said about ""female only"" jobs, like teaching. It works both ways, and people need to realise this. 

&gt; For a long time, the public felt that it wasn't a woman's place to be allowed to vote, and even once woman's suffrage happened, a lot of women felt they had to simply comply with their husband's choice because they were too inferior to make their own political decisions

Up until that point, men under 30 couldn't even vote, but popular history isn't to focus on this issue because Male issues didn't matter as well. We need to educate the young by breaking down any gender divides as best as possible, this isn't by blaming anyone, because all that does is get people to use the past and not think about the future. This has to happen with boys and girls. Not one or the other, but both.

There are gender divides, some can be changed, and some can't. But in this day and age, we are expected to take one side or the other because no one actually wants to have a sensible discussion about it. The side which I am trying to present is that, if people make their Sex (whether male or female) or the colour of their skin a defining feature, then they are part of the problem as well. The same as those who are prejudiced against others. It is an emotive subject, but it doesn't need pandering or PR. It needs to be laid out in an informative way to try and convince everyone that politics really is for the people.

But arguments like this will always get hounded down, either by so called ""Feminists"" or anyone who blames the ""White rich elite"".

He's much more defensively disciplined than Yaya, we saw that against arsenal when the Monaco defensive line was perfectly organised. Then when arsenal got lazy he started attacking and scored his fairly lucky long range goal. 

He'd be a really good long term investment, good enough to play a starting role and maybe then take over from Yaya  when he goes. Him and Fernandinho would be impenetrable ahead of the back 4.

It really comes down to you, although for pretty much any percentage you care top pick it would probably still benefit others more than it would harm you, and there is evidence that charitable giving boosts happiness more in the long run than having the money.

One thing to take into account is the effectiveness of the charity you give to, as some are orders of magnitude better at helping people than others. This is an area where GWWC along with a charity evaluator called Givewell do a lot of research, and there is a list of charities they recomend here: https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/top-charities.

The charities that come out best are generally healthcare interventions in developing countries, such as [SCI (schistosomiasis-control-initiative)](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative) which cures children of parasitic infections for around 50p per child in sub-Saharan Africa, or the Against Malaria Foundation which distribute anti-malarial bed nets. Interestingly the evidence also suggest that these are actually better ways of boosting education figures than directly building schools/sending textbooks etc. as poor health is a major driver behind a lack of education.

It's also handed them a huge propaganda victory and allowed them to spread to other countries.  At this point I doubt ISIS can be removed without significant military assistance (on the ground) from an external power.  The sort of capabilities the Iraqi army and Kurdish forces have seem to not be up to the task unless there is a major change in policy towards arming them and training them.  

If we really want ISIS gone as a foreign policy aim (and we should) then the chances are there will be a shift in strategy after Obama leaves office and there will be a new military coalition on the ground in Iraq early next year.

He is coming up to the later years of his career, and he certainly has to legs to beat Wiggos time (in better conditions, maybe), he may not have the fluidity though. I'm sure this is what puts him off, but on a purely maths level- is the fluidity going to be as major as the effects of altitude and high pressure (about 6%, or so I gather)? 

Same goes for Martin; who, as you point out would need some serious track time. That being said, his wattage over an hour is greater than what Wiggins can output, and feel as though the time Wiggo set today is well within his potential, providing he could get some fluidity in the velodrome. 

I would love Martin to take the record, probably after The Worlds (or between The Tour and The Worlds). I respect Tony a hell of a lot, but I think Wiggo is ultimately the fastest on the track, and would love for him to put a true top time in. As you say; at altitude, as I feel it is a time that would shelf the record for a long time to come.

It was a great time, but it is not the sort of time that is going to put Martin off one bit. 

The ultimate would be the 3 guys riding it at the same time. Imagine Cancellara in Switzerland, Martin at The Veledrom and Wiggo in London.

&gt;

&gt;In [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics), a __monopsony__ (from Ancient Greek μόνος (*mónos*) ""single"" + ὀψωνία (*opsōnía*) ""purchase"") is a [market form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_form) in which only one buyer interfaces with would-be sellers of a particular product.

&gt;The [microeconomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microeconomics) theory of [imperfect competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperfect_competition) assumes the __monopsonist__ can dictate terms to its suppliers, as the only purchaser of a good or service, much in the same manner that a [monopolist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopolist) is said to control the market for its buyers in a [monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly), in which only one seller faces many buyers.

&gt;In addition to its use in microeconomic theory, *monopsony* and *monopsonist* are descriptive terms often used to describe a market where a single buyer substantially controls the market as the major purchaser of goods and services. Examples include the [military industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_industry),  [space industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_industry),  and the [prison industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_industry).

I largely agree with the rest of what you have said but that's not what we were discussing, you were asking why I demonise Muslims based on the actions of &gt;1% and I was explaining why I don't.

From what I have seen the support of distinctly 'un-British' things such as sharia law make it impossible to combat Islamic radicalisation because what we see as radical they see as part of their religion.

That is the 1922 IRA that later became the Republic of Irelands National Army. Not the terrorist Provisional IRA of the 60's/70's. You actually linked to the pension section of the official archive website of the Irish Army.

You really need to stop.

Also I never suggested kicking anyone out, I said I don't think we should make provisions for them and their culture. You know like how no one gave into the IRA and Northern Ireland still exists or how the Hunger Strikers were left to die.

Also, the European Court of Justice doesn't enforce national law, only [Union Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_law) where I can't find a reference to land ownership. 

An alternative would be to declare the UK a republic, whilst writing a new constitution that meant all land was owned by the government, leasing the land to the previous owners minus the monarchy.

At the end of the day, the majority of us don't want to do that. The Queen has a better approval rating than the current government.

sorry? culture and language intertwine, overlap and overall have huge implications on one another. pretty ignorant statement. if someone leaves a country and is settling in a new place, they bring their cultural norms with them and there will often be miscommunication, misunderstandings and many other circumstantial situations.

""So, if I was from Nazi Germany and it was my tradition to say ""Jew"" instead of the person's name when I traveled abroad it's okay because it's my culture as long as the person is not offended himself? It's about as ridiculous."" 

okay well I'm a Jew and I could choose to be offended by something like this, but obviously this is just a copout argument on your half to use the weight of Nazi Germany to support your viewpoint.

""but that was definitely not the case for Suarez, he was in a different culture where he had been for long enough to be able to understand that it was offensive plus the fact that he's not black himself.""

okay, so this is just basically conjecture. can you please tell me the exact amount of time it takes for people to understand and adapt to new cultures? there must be some cutoff line right? 1 year enough, 2 years? 2 years and a day? 

""And calling every overweight person you see ""fatso"" like they usually do is actually always offensive, whether the target agrees to it or not""

okay no it isn't. maybe in your culture and your viewpoint it is, but in much of south america and I am assuming Spain it is not. we use these sort of descriptive terms in the most affectionate way. once again please don't mistake your contextual viewpoint as some sort of universal arbitrator what is considered offensive.

""I have a friend that is American with Philippine heritage and he's been in fist fights over being called ""Chino"" in the South American culture, since it's a big insult to him. Does he have the right to be offended?""

yes he does, but it does not mean that it is universally racist. perhaps this is more of a case of ignorance? well of course probably not to you in your armchair bubble

""And this type of slang has little to do with Rio Platanese, it's the same at least in the Spanish speaking parts of South and Central America.""

um it does have something to do with it because that is where suarez is from

""I have already read about it extensively back when it happened and I don't believe one word of what Suarez said in his semantic defense. Suarez and Evra are two hot heads and there's no doubt that Suarez used the word ""negro"" more than once, and that it was not used friendly while arguing and tugging at each other in the penalty area and that he followed up by pinching Evra's black skin. There was no reason for Evra to be making all this up. You are a delusional fool if you believe that whether it made it into the report or not. If he said ""Porque tu eres negro"" or ""Por qué, negro?"" is irrelevant to me in that context, do you get it?""

okay so just more conjecture on your part, with many assumptions of what actually took place on the pitch. obviously the use of  ""porque tu eres negro"" ""por que, negro"" ""por que vos sos un negro"" are irrelevant to you as you apparently have little to no knowledge of the Spanish language and South American culture.

null,false,vicioustyrant,null,null,null,"If you're into castles, here are some suggestions beyond the obvious Edinburgh Castle/Holyrood Palace combo... 

Get on the 41 bus from the city centre and visit Lauriston Castle. 16th century origins, 19th century extensions, and the interior has been preserved as it was in 1926 when it was given to the nation by its last owner. The views of the Forth are incredible, and the gardens are remarkable for two reasons - the Playfair design of the main garden and the Japanese Friendship garden which was a gift from Kyoto. It's also within walking distance of Cramond, so if you fancy checking out ruins from the northernmost Roman barracks you can. 

Stirling Castle is worth the train trip - it's a better tourist castle than Edinburgh in many ways (quality of information, layout, less 19th century additional nonsense etc.), and tends to be a little quieter. The Great Hall is amazing, as is the King's Old Building. 

Take a short train ride out to Linlithgow and check out the ruins of the palace. It's where Mary, Queen of Scots was born. They're pretty extensive ruins and take a good few hours to nose around. There's a pretty little church next door that's worth a look, and a pub across the road called The Four Marys that does excellent food and real ales. Stroll round the loch, feed the swans, grab an ice cream... it's a good day. 

You can also jump on the 37 bus and head out to Roslin to see the ruins of Rosslyn Castle. It was built in the 14th century, got the crap kicked out of it by Cromwell in the 17th century, then was eventually abandoned in 1788. It's also right round the corner from Rosslyn Chapel, with all its intricate carvings and grail hoaxes/legends. Well worth a look. 

Or you could do something completely unrelated to castles and get the 29 out to Gilmerton Cove, which is a really odd little system of sandstone caves beneath a betting shop in a suburb. They're not naturally occurring caves, but no-one is entirely sure how they got there or what they were used for. A family lived there for about 10 years in the 18th century and claimed to have hewn them out, but that's almost certainly bullshit.

With Sturridge likely to pick up injuries and will be out until October anyway, this makes Ings highly likely to be number 1 for periods. 

Now we're all hoping we'll sign another forward (Benteke looking most likely, which I'm actually all for as explained [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/37puoy/benteke_potentially_a_waste_of_325m_if_rodgers/crotaih) if you're interested). If someone like Benteke does come in then yeah, he'd be rotated a lot more. But given the abundance of fixtures we'll have with Europa/cup games Ings will have a lot of chances still. 

I think we'll play the diamond occasionally too, allowing room for 2. [This](http://lineupbuilder.com/2014/custom/?sk=7sx58) formation is my ideal one for what are looking likely transfers. All it would take is for Sturridge to pick up a knock and Ings would take his place in that line up.

null,false,midas22,null,null,null,"&gt;sorry? culture and language intertwine, overlap and overall have huge implications on one another. pretty ignorant statement. if someone leaves a country and is settling in a new place, they bring their cultural norms with them and there will often be miscommunication, misunderstandings and many other circumstantial situations.

Yes, language and culture intertwine but it's not the same thing as you're repeatedly saying. You have to adapt your language to your current surroundings.

&gt;okay well I'm a Jew and I could choose to be offended by something like this, but obviously this is just a copout argument on your half to use the weight of Nazi Germany to support your viewpoint.

I wrote it to show how irrelevant it is what your culture is in your native country when you're abroad.

Suarez claimed that his grandmother used the term ""negro"" or whatever but that doesn't mean that it was right. Maybe the Nazis were saying ""Jew"" to your grandmother in an endearing way or your great grandmother used the word ""negro"" in what she thought was an endearing way to her servants as well, it doesn't mean that it was right. It just means that Central and South America is behind the west in the evolution of morality and language.

&gt;okay, so this is just basically conjecture. can you please tell me the exact amount of time it takes for people to understand and adapt to new cultures? there must be some cutoff line right? 1 year enough, 2 years? 2 years and a day?

Most people of normal intellect do understand the basics of a new culture within a few days or weeks, like the fact that you should not walk around and call random people ""fatso"" or ""blackie"" whatever language you're speaking.

&gt;okay no it isn't. maybe in your culture and your viewpoint it is, but in much of south america and I am assuming Spain it is not. we use these sort of descriptive terms in the most affectionate way. once again please don't mistake your contextual viewpoint as some sort of universal arbitrator what is considered offensive.

What if the ""skinny"" guy has an eating disorder or the ""fatso"" has a disease and is embarrassed about his weight, is it still affectionate and endearing to them? Does it only apply to men or is it okay to call women ""fatso"" and ""shorty"" as well? What amount of overweight do you need before it's okay to call someone ""fatso""? Your arguments are beyond stupid.

&gt;yes he does, but it does not mean that it is universally racist. perhaps this is more of a case of ignorance? well of course probably not to you in your armchair bubble

Well, ignorance and racism goes hand in hand. You can call it whatever you want but I can agree that ""Chino"" is ignorance and ""negro"" is racism if you like since Chinese is not a race.

&gt;um it does have something to do with it because that is where suarez is from

Yes, but nothing about this mentioned type of slang is specific for Rio Platanese.

&gt;okay so just more conjecture on your part, with many assumptions of what actually took place on the pitch. obviously the use of ""porque tu eres negro"" ""por que, negro"" ""por que vos sos un negro"" are irrelevant to you as you apparently have little to no knowledge of the Spanish language and South American culture. 

Obviously you have no idea about me at all. Spanish is my third language but I'm fairly fluent in it since I'm living in Central America now and has lived in Central and South America for many years and studied the language before that. I'm not splitting hairs with these quotes but all I'm saying is that ""por que, negro"" is bad enough to use in an situation like this. The word ""negro"" is never endearing in an argument or a fight, it's quite the opposite.

I personally hear these words every day and I get called ""whitey"" dozens of times a day. Sometimes endearing and sometimes hateful, and using these words is always ignorant at best.

OF COURSE IT FUCKING IS.

When you look purely at the cost of the mortgage repayment you're not looking at the total cost of ownership of a house. 

I really wish people like you would stop comparing just the mortgage payments to rent.

12% thought it was right to call for the death of those who insult Islam.

13% thought it was right to react with violence to those who those who insult Islam.

4% thought Al Quaeda's attacks were justified.

20% were sympathetic to those who carried out the 7/7 bombings.

7-10% aren't loyal to Britain.

Again 40% support Sharia Law being introduced in areas of Britain.

25-30% thought the prosecution of Abu Hamza was unfair.

60% would never, under any circumstances attack an Islamic country (Iran given as example)

So that all seems like a concern to me. You can't now say that those polls are unrepresentative when they are taken from different ages, social backgrounds, gender and location, following all polling regulations and is carried out by a respected polling institute. 

Also this is one of the more lenient polls carried out.

&gt;actions speak louder than words and I havent seen british muslims trying to do that in the last 9 years

And i've already explained why they haven't. They are surrounded by not only 93% of Muslims but the other 95% of the country who think they are twats.

null,false,Cloudsinmycoffee987,null,null,null,"I've just heard about the death of Charles Kennedy. He was an unknown figure in Australia of course, so I have only found out surfing the net today, but I became full of admiration for his talents when I lived in the UK for a short time. His speech at the Lib Dem national conference around 2001 had me jumping for joy at the radio. At last, here was an articulate politician with real commitment to social justice. What a rarity. 

When I returned home I was in despair of the political scene in Australia. For some reason, I wrote him an email asking if he could visit Australia to reinvigorate progressive politics here. Someone with his intellect, his gift of oratory, was sure to spark some passion. This would have been around 2005. I was stunned that he wrote back, a very heartfelt and personal reply, saying something about having visited not long before - I can't recall the details. I think I was rather shocked at having even been given a reply! But what a fantastic thing to do and totally in keeping with the kind of man I think he must have been. 

I hope that the people in his old constituency knew what they were doing when they voted him out, and didn't do so just to make a cheap point. I hope the change pays off in some way for them. Because quite frankly it is hard to imagine anyone else having the same intellectual rigour or penchant for hard work that Kennedy brought to his work as an MP. 

We are all worse off for his passing, but so much better off that he chose public life so early.

Why? Well, I have relatives who emigrated to Canada, it is culturally linked (commonwealth) to us but also to our biggest media influence - the U.S. Canada even have a French bit which makes it feel European! Oh and I guess it does feel a bit Scottish. 

Finally, and this is general perception in the UK, Canada is held up as pretty much what we wish the U.S. was - friendlier, more open and globally literate, a bit more liberal/centrist, doesn't bring up a 200 year old war when you meet them, understands sarcasm etc etc. 

As an aside: I remember being told that if you meet someone and think they might be from North America you should ask them if they're Canadian rather than from the U.S. as Americans won't get offended because they consider Canada as basically a part of the U.S. but this isn't true the other way round.

null,false,thebluerabbi,null,null,null,"There has been a lot of discussion on Reddit recently on what charities to give to, mostly focused on the US. I've been working in this field for 15 years, first for the UK Charity regulator, and now as a consultant on the topic. 

- First, please be reassured that the vast majority of charities are legitimate. Cases of institutional fraud in the developed world are extremely rare. Bogus cash fundraising is the main thing to look out for. The cases that have recently been highlighted on reddit are largely about defrauding the tax man, rather than the donor. US regulation of charity at the Federal Level is not terribly effective, in truth. 

Nevertheless, some simple guidelines can help ensure your money is going in the right place: 

- If you want to support a local charity, which ones can you see around you doing a good job? Give to those.

- Giving overseas? Go with one of the big ones. There are many complications in doing charity work in foreign countries, and the big charities have the infrastructure, scale and clout to deal with it more effectively.  

- Support charities whose name gives a clear indication of their mission. Its hard for the *West Sussex Children's Cancer Relief Charity* to spend money on anything other than children's cancer in W. Sussex without looking fishy. A charity called *The Rainbow Trust*, however, could spend money anywhere without anyone knowing whether that was appropriate or not. 

- Check out the website. How much information is there? Can you see accounts, the names of all the management and trustees?  Does it feel like they are eager to share and explain? (All good things). Is everyone related (could be a warning sign)?

- In my experience of inspecting charities in the UK, some types of charity are better than others. The most impressive charities I ever visited, in terms of dedication, impact, and value for money for society, were.... drugs rehabilitation charities. The least effective... animal charities. (Obviously, this is my personal view, and not the view of the UK government for whom I no longer work). 

Finally, I would say this. As someone who has had a chance to see and critically appraise the operations of charities, big and small, from the first world to the third, in Europe, Asia and Africa - do not hesitate in giving. You will be amazed at what a difference even a small amount of money can make to people's lives, and the almost humbling devotion of people around the world to making the best of the funds you provide.

I've been working for [RNIB](http://www.rnib.org.uk/volunteering/find-volunteering-opportunities-near-you/search?volunteer_region=Northern+Ireland&amp;category=All) (not the boats, as many people think! Royal National Institute of the Blind, who work with people with various levels of sight loss) since 2006. I do confidence building/assertiveness training/wellbeing workshops/one-to-one coaching with service users and have done social media training with staff. Volunteers help with IT, admin, events, visual awareness training, children &amp; family projects. Taking people with sight loss out on tandem bike rides might appeal to some of you cyclists!

[Beat Carnival](http://www.beatcarnival.com) arts charity - drummed in their samba band for about 5 years (just did a 2-day masterclass, which was brilliant); they play public events in Belfast, Downpatrick, Derry, Bangor, Larne (many of the yearly carnivals and St Patrick's Day events) and have done the finale at Culture Night the last couple of years. They do cross-community outreach with drumming, have free weekly arts programmes for kids (as well as the Thurs night samba classes for adults), perform at one-off events like a kids' charity night at the zoo last Fri night - lots to get involved in.

[Beyond Skin](http://www.beyondskin.net/) - diversity education charity who do ""Interactive World Music Experiences"" (bringing groups of local and immigrant musicians out to community groups and schools to play music with the audience and answer blunt questions about immigration, racism etc); festivals, world music arts &amp; dance workshop; international radio production projects; rural global village experience; OCN-accredited courses; diversity training; live world music performances; international media exchange projects (e.g. ""Parallel Versing"" was a project linking primary school groups in NI and Sri Lanka to create a music track together online). They're now partners of WOMAD for festivals and outreach work here; great achievement. I played in some of their music projects/festivals a few years back and have done some wellbeing workshops for staff and user groups; haven't been directly involved in a few years but still a huge fan of their work.

[NOW Project](http://www.nowproject.co.uk/what-we-do#node-anchor-72) - a social enterprise that supports people with learning disabilities, learning difficulties or Autistic Spectrum disorders into work or education. I've done some coaching and social media training for staff there and was (am) really impressed with their projects (food from their [Loaf Catering](http://www.loafcatering.com/) project is class too!).

I volunteered as chair of the steering group and did a wellbeing workshop for young people for [Rathbone UK in NI](http://www.rathboneuk.org/Pages/find-us/Rathbone-in-Northern-Ireland.aspx) a few years back, for one year - they did detached outreach work with kids in north Belfast, going out on the streets and into housing facilities to talk to young people, organising sports and arts events and some training opportunities. When I left the charity had just been taken over and the future of the NI one was uncertain because of very different needs here to areas in GB, and we didn't fit the new charity's model so well. The NI page of the website's doesn't seem to have been updated since 2012 so not sure if it's still running, but the manager, Colm, who I got on really well with (great, hard worker passionate about youth work) is now at the [Colin Glen Trust](https://www.facebook.com/colinglentrust) doing outdoor pursuits with young people, you could check that out. 

Carers organisations: [MeUnltd](http://meunltd.org/testimonials/) (cross-border) and [CAUSE](http://www.cause.org.uk/) carers, I've done wellbeing and social media training for these and they're both excellent.

I did some festivals training for NIAMH (NI Action on Mental Health - thinking of doing a fundraising [Sofa Session](http://dreamdolove.com/category/sofasessions/) gig for them at end of August so if you're an artist, get in touch!).

&gt; Muslims do tend to have a common culture/history and they tend to speak one of a handful of languages (Arabic/Urdu/Turkish for instance and perhaps Somali/Nigerian).

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world#Demographics) says:

&gt; Approximately 23% of the world's population is Muslim. Current estimates conclude that the number of Muslims in the world is around 1.6 billion. Muslims are the majority in 49 countries, they speak hundreds of languages (over forty languages are spoken in Iran alone), and come from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Major languages spoken by Muslims include Arabic, Urdu, Bengali, Punjabi, Malay, Javanese, Sundanese, Swahili, Hausa, Fula, Berber, Tuareg, Somali, Albanian, Bosnian, Russian, Turkish, Azeri, Kazakh, Uzbek, Tatar, Persian, Pashto, Balochi, Sindhi and Kashmiri, among many others.

Even the smallest of those has millions of speakers.

Furthermore, ""Nigerian"" is not a language.  [Wikpedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Nigeria) again:

&gt; There are 521 languages that have been spoken in Nigeria ...  major languages are Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba, Ibibio, Edo, Fulfulde, and Kanuri. Nigeria's linguistic diversity is a microcosm of Africa as a whole, encompassing three major African languages families: Afroasiatic, Nilo-Saharan, and Niger–Congo. Nigeria also has several as-yet unclassified languages, such as Cen Tuum, which may represent a relic of an even greater diversity prior to the spread of the current language families.",null,0,null,1433751929,null,0,false,0,crz9hbs,null,t3_38wkkv,null,t1_crz9hbs,null,t1_cryjtoq,null,null,null,1436817305,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I'm the same age as you but a couple of bad choices in my teens and twenties led me to where I am now, unhappy, demoralised and concerned for my future.

I've been researching various online courses for about 6 months now, from full on degrees to short courses on EDx. Nothing really caught my attention as much as this course did, bear in mind it's not a degree, simply a 12 month course to enhance my writing skills, introduce me to the world of music journalism and *potentially* send me down a new career path, not necessarily as a journalist but hopefully something more fulfilling than the current nightmare I call my job.

I had considered programming but I just don't have an interest in it, music is something I'm passionate about and as I can't play an instrument the next best thing I can do is write about it, or learn to at the very least.

I see people say this quite often and my experience is the opposite. I own a modern property and the quality is excellent. My old houses really were built of questionable materials (asbestos in the roofing, some lead pipes, and wall I removed had loads of screwed up newspaper in it!) 

The house I live in and the ones my friends own seem to be built in the way people want to live - they have long kitchens which easily accommodate a large kitchen table, and they have double doors going out to the garden. Admittedly, the gardens are not as big as my previous houses, but I don't feel it's small (I've had around 30 people for a BBQ and it wasn't a problem). I guess it varies between developments, but I have never seen awkward room sizes in the new builds I looked at previously, or my friends.

What exactly have they said?

&gt;  So that would be my mother, correct or not correct?

You say she's on housing benefit.  That would imply your home is rented in which case your mother is not ""a resident owner-occupier"".  She would be a tenant, which would put her at number 2 on that list  - ""a resident tenant"".

If you are also on the tenancy you would also be a resident tenant and hence jointly liable with your mother.  If you're not on the tenancy then you would be lower down the list and hence not directly liable for council tax.

However there's a separate consideration which is how much the council tax bill is.  As a person on benefits your mum is entitled to claim council tax support (CTS)to help pay the bill.  When working out her entitlement they will look at the whole household, and the fact the household contains another working adult (you) may well reduce the amount of CTS she can get.

So even though you might not be jointly liable you can still effect how much council tax is due.  If that is the case it's between you and your mother to agree how much you should contribute, just as it is for you to agree how you should contribute towards other household bills.",null,0,null,1433752909,null,0,false,0,crz9p5k,null,t3_38zuqg,null,t1_crz9p5k,null,t3_38zuqg,null,null,null,1436817495,null,6,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,6,null

&gt;##Travelling in the EU

There would still be 90 days visa waivers in place in most European countries. Even if there weren't there would be 30 days waivers. That is more than enough time to enjoy two weeks in the sun. Longer queues at the airport? That constitutes a serious argument for staying in? Pathetic.

&gt;##Moving to another EU country to live, work or retire

It would introduce a lot of red tape, but given the determination it requires to move house to another country in the first place, I am quite certain that a bit more red tape won't deter the people who want to leave anyway. I know people who have emigrated to America and Canada, and while there were forms involved and waiting times for documents, it wasn't an horrific nightmare. I know of one person who didn't manage to emigrate and that's because she was dumb enough to try and jump the border and get hitched on holiday and they found her out.

&gt;##The second home on the Med?

A minority of people. If anything it would do the Spanish economy some good to stop having their housing hogged. And I also think that it shows exactly who the Guardian are aiming at these days if they're citing *that* as a major concern. Hardly the concern of Fireman Jack.

&gt;##Consumer rights

Refunds and returns were possible in the 80s, last I checked. I'm quite certain that those rights are enshrined in the Sale of Goods Act 1979. But hey, I'm not a professor. I might be wrong.

&gt;businesses could urge that these standards be lowered.

Could? That's the best you've got?

&gt;##Trade with the EU

We would be able to get a good Free Trade deal with Europe. I can't imagine there is enough spite in their hearts to give sufficient impetus to cast us adrift completely and leave us hamstrung with a one sided negotiation. That said, I agree that a lot of jobs would go. I can't imagine Nissan, for example, would keep a factory up north.

&gt;##Trade with the rest of the world

I'm pretty confident we'd be ok on this front. If the best the EU can do with America is TTIP then why do we need the EU? It already opens the door to privatising everything. How much worse could it possibly get?


&gt;##Pay, holidays, maternity and paternity leave

###Fact check

Maternity pay in the UK is 36 weeks: 6 months (24 weeks) full pay; 3 months (12 weeks) half pay. Last I checked, that is statutory. My wife got the Maternity Allowance on that basis for 9 months as an out of work benefit because she's self-employed. It was a more-than-healthy £550 a month based on her income prior to going on leave. The government will pay 90% of your weekly earnings up to a maximum of (IIRC) £136 a week, working out to roughly £550/week maximum.

On the other side of the English Channel, in that last bastion of solidarity, yea Mighty France, the world's home of Socialists and Republicans, maternity pay is 16 weeks! 4 months! That's your lot! Beyond that there is something called *Congé parental* - Parental Leave -  which can last up to 18 months but IS NOT PAID.

And I'm supposed to think that leaving the EU is going to decimate our welfare state? If anything the EU needs to catch up with US. Nice, professor. Nice.

&gt;##Clean beaches and the environment

&gt;Again, there would be demands to reduce the regulatory burden.

And what? There are demands to reduce the regulatory burden already. Brussels is full of lobbyists of every stripe.

&gt;##Crime

I would imagine that there is enough common interest across the boarders to find solutions to tracking down known criminals. What am I supposed to believe?

&gt;""We chased a gang leader out of Britain and we believe he's hiding in France. Could you find him and send him back?""  
&gt;""lol no we want all the crime for ourselves.""

null,false,tadskis,null,null,null,"1. Records show Irish lands exported food even during the worst years of the Famine. When Ireland had experienced a famine in 1782–83, ports were closed to keep Irish-grown food in Ireland to feed the Irish. Local food prices promptly dropped. Merchants lobbied against the export ban, but government in the 1780s overrode their protests. No such export ban happened in the 1840s.

2.The Famine gave considerable impetus to the shift from Irish to English as the language of the majority. Those most gravely affected by the Famine were mostly in Irish-speaking districts, and those districts also supplied most of the emigrants. 

3.Island of Ireland's population had fallen to 4.4 million, about the same as the population in 1800 and 2000 and only a half of its peak population 8.5 million.
On the other hand, the population of England and Wales doubled from 16 million in 1841 to 32.5 million in 1901.

So pre-famine mostly Gaelic speaking Ireland consisted almost half the population of GB. Problem? Hunger happens, no matter, let them die or run away into America but export food without restrictions. Profit - huge population shift at the expense of Ireland and less trouble for English domination with greatly reduced numbers of those pesky catholic Irish Gaelic speaking troublemakers. They managed to make enough trouble even being decimated in relation to England but imagine what a pain in the ass they could have been if there were 15 million Irish in Ireland in 1900?

Why is the burden of proof on LGBT* folks, such that they have to prove that revulsion, aversion and discrimination against them is bad? There is plenty of evidence that homosexuality is a naturally occurring phenomenon in multiple species, and is in fact perfectly normal. 

We don't ask anti-racist people to have to prove that racism is bad to, say, the EDL or BNP. A reason for this is that racism has been shown to have no basis in anything other than bigotry and nastiness. Also, throughout history, most people would agree that societies with less racism are more pleasant to live in. Thus we ask racists to prove that what they are saying is with merit.

null,false,kugrian,null,null,null,"AN MP used his maiden speech in the House of Commons to complain that Londoners moving to Brighton and Hove are clogging up commuter trains and buying up precious property.

New Hove MP, Peter Kyle highlighted the city’s housing crisis during his speech on Wednesday.

Speaking in front of a packed house, the Labour MP praised the city’s universities and social life, adding: “All of this explains why our city has been voted the best place to live.

“We do however have a problem,” he joked. “The problem is with immigration: that's people flocking down from London, buying up property and clogging up our commuter trains.”

Speaking to The Argus yesterday, he said the quip was a response to the Conservative stance on immigration but added there was some grounding to it.

He said: “Forty percent of housing transactions in Brighton and Hove are from people in London. That is putting pressure on our housing stock and causing our prices to go up.

“We need an honest conversation about this.

“We need to balance it by making sure we have enough affordable housing coming on stream and making sure there are homes for people who already live here.

“I don’t want to deter people coming from outside – we just need to get the balance right.”

Phil Graves, who runs Graves Jenkins estate agents, said there was truth in the idea of Londoners bringing about a rise in prices.

He said: “Certainly the market is very popular with London commuters.

“You can’t stop people coming here.

“We want and need London buyers – London is a very important part of our market.”

He said he sympathised with first-time buyers, who are “often propped up by the bank of mum and dad”, adding: “That’s the way it is.”

The council’s City Plan makes a provision for affordable housing with the current Brighton Marina development a good example of it in action.

A total of 853 flats are to be built in the Marina, with work on phase one of the Outer Harbour due in the middle of next year.

The first two apartment blocks, comprising 195 flats, will see 20 affordable properties.

Mr Graves added: “We have been trying to solve this issue for some time.

“The people who are ‘clogging up’ commuter trains may well be the same people selling their houses to a London buyer.”

Mr Kyle himself moved from Bognor to Brighton in 1996 as a 26-year-old for university.

He added: “I don’t want to deter people coming here but we are getting to the point where someone won’t be able to afford a deposit without saving for 19 years.”

However, it is not just people buying homes who are affected.

In 2000, 3,700 families sought help from the council for housing – 50% more than in the late 1990s. In 2013, that figure stood at 16,000.

The same year, nearly 1,000 homes in Hove were bought by Londoners aged 25 to 44. Meanwhile research by Savills estate agent found Portslade saw the biggest rise in house prices across the south of Englandwith an average sale price of under £250,000.

We sent reporter Gareth Davies to find some Londoners living in Brighton. Where did we send him? London Road, of course

Yesterday the search for a former Londoner was difficult and we had to speak to lots of people before unearthing one.

“I ain’t from London, mate. Brighton born and bred,” was the cry from some.

The search continued at the Open Market, where Christian Cotton, owner of Smorl’s food bar, was born in Worthing, schooled in Shoreham and now lives in Brighton.

He did not have any customers from London at the time but he knows many that he could link us up with.

“I’ve got a lot of neighbours who are DFLs (Down From London), and it’s great for traders,” he said.

“They make the big bucks in the big city and then come here to spend their hard-earned cash.” The attraction of the south coast was clear for most to see, including Oliver Ovett, who has lived in the city all his life.

He said: “It’s the best place to live in the country by far. It’s easy to see why people want to come down here from London. It’s the sea and the people.

“And if they can afford to come down and buy a place then good luck to them.”

Simon Reid landed in Brighton from Glasgow, via Cambridge.

He visited a friend who was at university in the city five years ago, and knew it was the place he wanted to call home.

He now does just that, living in Ditchling Road and running Twisted Rainbow in the Open Market.

“It’s just awesome here,” he said.

“The sea, the sunshine and the happy people make such a difference. “I’ve lived in places where everyone is just so miserable, but when I come back here I feel like I’m at home.”

But not everyone was sucked in by Brighton and Hove’s charm.

One man, who did not want to be named, said Brighton was the worst city he’d lived in having travelled the world with work.

The man was originally from Tipton in the West Midlands and moved to the coast 10 years ago.

He said: “Mediocrity rules here, it’s the most mediocre place on earth.

“I just don’t think you have to be good at anything here – you’re just accepted.”

Alex Abrahams, who works at the Chilli Shop in the Open Market, was born in Brighton and moved to London in the early 1990s before heading back here.

He said: “I came home basically because I was broke and everything is so expensive there.

“Brighton has always been London-by-the-Sea since the late 90s.”

After toiling long and hard, we finally stumbled across a former Londoner in the form of Gary Elmer, owner of Objet D’art.

He said: “I came down here about 30 years ago and I also lived in Spain for 10 years during that time.

“I was working close-by in Steyning so wanted to stay in the area.

“This was around the time when house prices down here weren’t too bad and they were sky high in London.

“When I initially moved to Sussex I worked for Laurence Olivier doing cooking and driving and bits for him.”

Since then, he’s run businesses ranging from a jacket potato shop on West Street to a delicatessen in Beaconsfield Road before ending up dealing antiques in the Open Market.

He added: “I can see why people do it, they get more for their money in terms of houses, the sea is right there and the countryside the other side.

“It’s got a lot going for it and I call it my home now.”

History of city’s path into London by the sea

FROM the days of the first steam train, Brighton and Hove has grown into London by the sea.

Before the rail line the city was a small medieval town called Brighthelmstone.

Many of its present-day suburbs such as Hangleton and Patcham were once separate villages entirely and Hove was a different town.

The first boom in housing came in the mid 1700s when property sprouted outwards from the nebulous of old Brighton town.

By 1835 six steam companies were vying to build a railway between London and Brighton.

Two years later Parliament agreed to a direct line and, in the summer of 1841, it opened.

By this point, with the population at 45,000, housing had spread north of Preston Park and out to the point of joining up Hove and Brighton.

Some of today’s upmarket architecture – most notably the uniform Regency squares – resulted from this boom with wealthy Londoners buying properties by the sea.

The piers followed along with theatres, fancy restaurants and seaside attractions.

The 1900s saw the growth of suburbia with many farms and outlying villages absorbed into Brighton.

At the turn of the 20th century,165,227 people lived in Brighton, Hove and Portslade - twice as many since the coming of the railway.

Peacehaven was built after the First World War, with the city’s suburban semis created either side of the Second World War. The population increased to 239,447 by 1951 and 253,210 by 1969.

Brighton Marina opened in the mid-1970s and was followed by updated main roads such as the A23 bypass in the 1990s, bridging the north of the city.

Salient passage:

""As observers, fixating on little details is often unhelpful; not least because you can’t judge the details without all the relevant information (as it’s the relevant information that reveals the details). I often don’t agree with a manager’s judgement calls, but then I don’t have the same knowledge of the game, and I certainly don’t have the knowledge that comes from being close to the players every day, and knowing their moods, their fitness, their personal issues, and so on.

Managers need to get the balance of the side right, but I have zero time for the “he’s out of position” protests – just one example of a manager “getting it wrong” that drives me mad. For example, unless Lionel Messi gets picked as a centre-back, or Luis Suarez starts the game in goal, then a Barcelona manager has the right to do what he wants with the talent at his disposal. In the end, Luis Enrique decided to move Messi wide and play Suarez centrally. If that didn’t work then absolutely everyone would call him mad to move the world’s top-scoring striker from his central position. If Lionel Messi (like Zinedine Zidane before him) can be deployed in a (nominal) wide role, then anyone can be played one step removed from their “best” position.

If a centre-back ever plays at full-back, or vice versa, or if a central midfielder players wide, or vice versa, or if a full-back plays as a winger, or vice versa, or a winger plays as a striker or vice versa, it’s almost always perfectly acceptable (unless, for example, the full-back is a clogger who can’t dribble or cross the ball, in which case he probably won’t cut it as a winger; but there may be times when a manager wants to double-up in defensive strength on one flank). So if you’re getting worked up about stuff like this you really need to ask if it’s incompetence on the manager’s part, or just a sensible distribution of resources based on the extra knowledge he has relating to the situation.""",null,0,null,1433759140,null,0,false,0,crzb276,null,t3_3908zs,null,t1_crzb276,null,t1_crza51r,null,null,null,1436818168,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

null,false,rytlejon,lfc68,,null,"I think you're absolutely right. But there's nothing more annoying than fans complaining about how everything's going to hell. 

Realistically, we aren't going to sign more than perhaps one expensive player this summer. The idea is that fundamentally, we have a good team, and that players like Lallana, Ibe, Markovic, Coutinho, Can are the people we should be banking on. We can't afford to compete economically with Man Utd, City, Chelsea. So we have to aim for those players: buy young, hope that it works out. Maybe sell someone (Suarez) and raise the overall quality of the squad. So realistically, our great players for next season were bought last summer. 

The aim for this summer should be to fill the biggest gaps (Striker, back-up striker, right back, back-up goalie) and to try to get experienced or somehow proven players for those positions. 

So if you're asking for world beaters, maybe we'll get *one* this season (like Icardi or Kovacic). But most of them we already have in the squad and we'll have to hope that they grow into it.

With that in mind, I'm happy with our signings so far. With Ings, Milner and Bogdan (if that happens), we'll have found another experienced midfielder, a decent (potentially great) back-up striker, an experienced and decent back-up keeper. Left on the list are a *good* striker (I'm hoping for Icardi, Vietto, Tevez) and a right back. 

We shouldn't be trying to replace Ibe, Markovic, Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana, Can just yet. We can't buy a full, great team, we have to settle with hoping our youngsters grow in to the team and turn out great.",null,0,null,1433760118,null,0,false,0,crzbafz,null,t3_390aad,null,t1_crzbafz,null,t1_crzaka5,null,null,null,1436818331,null,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11,null

Rule of thumb though - the more you put in as a deposit, the lower the rate of interest you will pay.  If you think that on £20k deposit, realistically you'll be looking at properties that are £200k or less.  Usually you'll get a mortgage of about 3 - 4 times your combined salary, so work out if that will give you £180k or not.  Finally, work out where you want to live based on that number - the further out you go the more you pay in transport, but the more you will get for your money.  Finally, remember that there are 'fees' associated with moving that you'll need to put aside on top of all that (solicitors, moving, up front costs of making the place liveable, furniture, etc).

PS there are a number of schemes for first time buyers that you should look into.

If you want my sincere advice - I'd advise you rent for another 6 - 12 months and save as much as you can (share houses, share a room, whatever).  Cut back on everything (going out, holidays, all luxuries).

Do you eat cornflakes? Same for that. Gummy Sweets? Again. Now A huge amount of food that we produce isn't eaten and cannot be eaten. It's called a strategic reserve. The reason why you don't see price fluctuations is due to this.

However this means the food cannot be stored for too long. As food spoils. So generally food that is no longer fit for human consumption is fed to animals which allows us to be more energy efficient. 

And no you can't just give all your corn to poor people. It destroys local farming by precipitously dropping the price of food in places like Africa making farming less profitable and more people will starve in the long run. 

And you cannot eat all the calories in food crops. Are you daft. Traditionally animals are fed hay which is not something you can eat. 

Do you eat the cobs of the corn? No? Why? Cause you cannot digest it. But cows and pigs can. So why not feed those bits to them and then eat them. That's how efficient farming works. 

And more than a 150 billion animals are killed? 

According to the WHO and USFood roughly 9.5 billion animals are slaughtered a year and the USA consumes 20% of the world's animals. Therefore you get around 50 billion animals. not 150 Billion. 

So firstly? Wrong about total animals eaten. Secondly? Wrong about what part of the calories from crops they eat.

I guess from the perspective of a Muslim for whom their religion is a big part of their identity, or from the perspective of a multiculturalist, integration means mosques spreading throughout the country without attracting hostility. However for many British people, what they mean by 'integration' is 'assimilation', so mosques are not a sign of integration but are a stark symbol of its failure.

I think this difference in meaning is key to hostility between Muslims and the native British. See this [New Statesman article](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2007/06/integration-ready-values) for an example. As you know, mainstream Islam is perfectly compatible with integration, defined in the multiculturalist sense, but is absolutely incompatible with assimilation.

I think as long as the native British expect assimilation, and the Muslim community expects integration in the multiculturalist sense, there will be conflict. What are your views on this? I advocate assimilation because I'm afraid of the possibility of Britain developing an [Ottoman empire style millet system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet_%28Ottoman_Empire%29) which would be a disaster for democracy, and social cohesion and trust in general.",null,0,null,1433762373,null,0,false,0,crzbuch,null,t3_38weoe,null,t1_crzbuch,null,t1_crylzxf,null,null,null,1436818583,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

A 'meh' 5:52 with *very* limited training - a handful of small runs and plenty of dog walking.

The length isn't at all unmanageable, if you just plod your way along. The hills are the pain!

If you live in a hilly place just make sure your runs incorporate as many steep hills as you can! If you don't... Can you travel to some once a week? Otherwise get on a treadmill with an incline! 

(When training) When you're running the hills really push on them. Try to keep the same rhythm you had before and keep it all the way to the top. Then between the top and the start of the next you need to be recovering. 

You should aim to gradually build up the total length that you're running per week. And the pace.

I don't know what sort of time you'd be hoping for. But unless you're going for an all out sprint I think the most important part is recovery between hills. You need to be able to keep going at a moderate pace for the whole time, put the effort in on the hills and recover as much as possible between them!

Best of luck!

Was my first time on a geared bike (had a rev and go moped about 10 years ago) and after a little bit of a struggle getting the hang of low speed clutch control and gears, I did get the hang of it.                    
Took about 30 minutes to an hour on the road section to completely get the gears as off the road I didn't get chance to get out of 2nd.                   
                   
My biggest issue was screwing up the gears. After I got into the habit of getting into 1st prior to feet down at a junction or general stop it helped a lot. Added to mentally noting the gears as I changed and getting used to the feel/sound of a gear chance (the little click), come the last hour or so on the road I was changing pretty well.                         
                                 
Just remember take your time and if you feel yourself panicking or stressing take a few deep breathes then try again.

* I highly doubt the legitimacy of this statement, due to firstly my disbelief of Edexcel contacting one member of a various number of communities, rather than making a statement via their website etc.
* It very much seems to be a scapegoat for the earlier Non-Calc exam
* TSR and other websites including social media are already flooded with the answers and I don't think that stopping it here will make much of an impact.
* The said reason for the wanted blackout is that members of other countries are taking their exams later on in the day and we could be sharing details with them, however from my knowledge and what I have seen of other people's, people in different countries take iGCSEs and not our English GCSEs.

For these reasons, I will refrain from deleting any answers for now. What I will say is people can refrain from it themselves to be safe as such and I would recommend this for the time being. I struggle to believe a company of Edexcel's size would try and stop the faulty system there has been for decades now with a message to one member of a forum.

Until I have other information or Edexcel release a statement, no further action will be pursued. However, I'd like to see what you guys think about this, and if we should remove answers or not.

Combating homophobia should be done, as you rightly say, by everyone. All the evidence to show the baselessness of homophobia has been presented time and again, and are generally accepted into our understanding of the world.

The only people still with a prejudicial attitude against LGBT* people are not going to be ""convinced"" out of it by evidence. Their arguments revolve around either religious conviction, illogical resistance to any kind of social change (however beneficial), or base revulsion. Arguments to suggest that being gay is either a choice or is a socially harmful phenomenon are almost always made in bad faith. Refuting these arguments is a waste of time for LGBT* people, because for the bigots it was never about the arguments themselves in the first place.

The LGBT* movement has been remarkably successful at breaking into the mainstream, and have made being something other than heterosexual and even cisgender more normal than it has ever been. The way to combat bigotry is to show that it is an outlier and unwelcome. Excluding a UKIP organisation based upon their bigoted policy is a good way to do this. In the same way, I would expect a Pride demonstration to exclude the EDL (back when they were a thing), even though the EDL had a pinkwashing LGBT* group. UKIP are not as blatantly bad as the EDL, obviously, but they are both organisations with bigoted policies. I don't know if there was ever a situation in which the EDL tried to get in on a Pride march.

The organisations with which you are prepared to share a platform mean a lot. Pride would be making a statement whether they chose to allow UKIP to be a part of it or not, and they chose one statement over another. They *are* tackling UKIP head on by saying ""your policies are bigoted, and regardless of the orientation or gender identification of your members, we cannot allow you to be a part of Pride while you have those bigoted policies"". It shows that homophobia is wrong when a huge umbrella like Pride has no truck with those prepared to use it to grub votes. It shows that homophobia is an outlier, and with most people is unwelcome.",null,0,null,1433763494,null,0,false,0,crzc57s,null,t3_38qo5y,null,t1_crzc57s,null,t1_crzavjg,null,null,null,1437566000,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

Might as well do the actual maths on this as I'm bored in my lunch break. 

£180K houses, with £750pcm yield. 

£80M gets you 444 houses. 

Assume 5% vacancy at any point in time, and that's 421 houses at a rental yield of £750 pcm. 

Assume each house costs £20 in insurance each month, with £100 sink fund per month for maintenance needs. 

Assume a 5% letting agent deal to manage the properties. 

So £750 - 5% - £100 - £20 = £492.50 profit.

Subtract another 20% for misc costs, staff, etc. 

£394 profit per property, per month. 

£394 * 444 = £174,936 per month, or 2,099,232 per year return before tax. 

2.62% returns without factoring in house prices raising. 

Plus you get to have something to do with your time. 

It's probably not the best way to invest your money, but it's probably one of the safest ways. Everyone needs property, and unless we elect communists it's going to be like that for a long long time.

But in this case it was close and we know that a lot of people who voted no have now changed sides since. The only *right* answer is the *representative* answer.

Sometimes the situation calls for these things to be reexamined. Take the hypothetical case of a government heavily propagandising one answer to the point of lying.

null,false,DrBasedGod,lfc99,,null,"I would like to make a case for Mandzukic

The man is a maniac in the pressing game. I've seen a lot of concern about target men and whether they fit our style, and Mandzukic fits us amazingly well even without being a quick lad. He presses with intensity and his workrate made him a mainstay both in the possession-based Bayern and the quick counterattacking Athletico Madrid teams. Fiery disposition, a player who works hard for everything he gets. The kind of guy you want on your team to show the youngsters how it's done.

He is a quality finisher, showing the ability to score around 15-20 goals per season at the top level and in the Champions League. He has the experience of playing for the big boys and holding his own, and at a rumored price of around 15m I think he'd be a bargain for that kind of finishing ability. He also shows a good ability to find assists and that indicates that he can play in a passing team.

Aerial presence. He's not amazingly tall but great in the air. This team barely crosses and I think it has the opposite problem that Kenny's teams had. With Kenny, everyone knew we were going for the cross into Carroll's head, so they pressed wide to the wingers and tried to stop crosses going in. With Rodgers, teams know there's no one in the box, so they squeeze in tight and get compact to force our guys out wide and try to play balls into tight spaces. With a legit aerial presence we could space out the defense and keep them on their toes because we have plenty of players like Lallana and Hendo who can put a quality ball into the box.

Benteke for 30m doesn't exactly make me jizz my pants and Aubameyang for 20m+ doesn't particularly give me a raging semi. Mandzukic offers the ability to start immediately with a price tag that isn't unreasonable, and he also would give us something different. I would argue that Lambert, although a big lad, doesn't *play* like a target man. Perhaps having a legit target man who isn't as bad as Andy Carroll would improve the team's balance.

You could play Mandzukic up front alone in that 4-2-3-1 Rodgers has been trying and I think the formation would work better with a stronger striker like him up top. You could also go to the diamond with Studge making runs off of Mandzukic. I think he works in a variety of systems including Rodgers' ideal 4-3-3 which requires a lot of pressing by the striker.",null,0,null,1433764383,null,0,1433764567,0,crzcee0,null,t3_37az31,null,t1_crzcee0,null,t3_37az31,null,null,null,1436818919,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

null,false,danielsamuels,eng-Suffolk,Cambridge,null,"&gt; Building new housing does not push down the price of nearby properties, according to research that runs counter to the widely held belief that the best way to make housing more affordable is to increase supply.
&gt;
&gt; A pilot study by the London School of Economics looked at eight developments of nearly 300 homes each, built in the Midlands and the south of England by the housebuilder Barratt in the past five years.
&gt; 
&gt; The sites were all in suburbs or villages. Most faced substantial opposition from local residents before they were constructed.
&gt; 
&gt; All of the schemes were large in proportion to the number of homes in the local area. Yet in none of the cases did house prices fall once construction was completed, although in some cases prices went down slightly during construction, the LSE researchers found.
&gt; 
&gt; In some cases prices even went up in the surrounding area after the scheme was built.
&gt; 
&gt; “Developments of the size and scale studied, even in areas where originally objections were significant, can lead to more rapid rises in local house prices,” the report said.
&gt; 
&gt; The findings reflect those of Kate Barker, a former Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member, who produced an influential report on house prices in 2004. Ms Barker found that housing supply was “not particularly responsive to changes in house prices”.
&gt; 
&gt; Many economists and housing industry analysts argue Britain needs to build more homes to moderate future house price rises. Most agree that the country needs between 200,000 and 300,000 new homes a year, but in 2013-14 Britain built only 141,000.
&gt; 
&gt; The research was commissioned by Barratt and the National House Building Council but lead researcher Christine Whitehead said they had not interfered with the report’s findings, which were independent.
&gt; 
&gt; Philip Barnes, Barratt’s group land and planning director, said local residents’ opposition to new houses was often based on fears that it would drive down prices. The research “fits with our general experience that opposition to new homes often rapidly recedes as a development is built”, he said.
&gt; 
&gt; “This is a small sample but the developments in this study are typical of much of the housing being built in many towns and does suggest that this additional housing can be absorbed without an adverse impact on an &gt; individual local housing market.”
&gt; 
&gt; Neil Smith, head of research and innovation at the NHBC, said local opposition was “one of the main &gt; obstacles” to getting more homes built.
&gt; 
&gt; “It is understandable that homeowners will be anxious to protect their investment in their homes, and &gt; concerns about the negative effects of new developments have compounded the issue,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; “While there are clearly a number of factors affecting property values in specific areas, this research challenges the assumption that newbuild developments will adversely affect local house prices.”",null,0,null,1433764884,null,0,false,0,crzcjqa,null,t3_39077e,null,t1_crzcjqa,null,t1_crzb9nk,null,null,null,1437565995,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt;  Downing Street has been forced into a climb-down over whether Government ministers will have to resign if they want to campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, reports our Political Editor Peter Dominiczak.
Number 10 insisted that David Cameron ""has not set out"" whether ""collective responsibility"" will apply at the in-out referendum, which could be held next year.
Mr Cameron's spokeswoman insisted that the Prime Minister had only said that members of the Government would have to resign during the renegotiation phase leading up to the announcement of a referendum if they wish to campaign for Britain to leave the EU.
Mr Cameron has not made a decision about whether ministers would have to quit if they campaign for a British exit, Downing Street claimed.
It appears to leave open the possibility of ministers being able to campaign for Britain to leave the EU.
The Prime Minister was asked on Sunday at the G7 summit in Germany if he has “absolutely closed your mind to allowing ministers a free vote”. 
 The Prime Minister said: “I’ve been very clear. If you want to be part of the government, you have to take the view that we are engaged in an exercise of renegotiation, to have a referendum and that will lead to a successful outcome.”
When asked if anyone “in Government who opposes that will have to resign”, the Prime Minister said: “Everyone in Government has signed up to the programme set out in the Conservative manifesto.”
However, following warnings that it would lead to mass Cabinet resignations, Downing Street was forced to clarify the Prime Minister's comments.
His spokeswoman said that the Prime Minister's comments had been ""over-interpreted"".

Maybe not of the quality needed, but important to remove the weakness we had at that position at times. 

I still do not get why we are interested in Bogdan as he had only 1 good game and that was against us and he have been the number 2 GK for Bolton. It does not seem like he is anywhere close to be beating Mignolet for that position. 

Highly doubt we will go for Charlie Austin, would rather prefer Benteke compared to Austin to be honest. 

Lets say we get either Clyne or Trippier, a decent GK and striker. One of my biggest concerns are still at the DM position, as neither Allen, Henderson, Can or Milner can play in that position. Lucas is injury prone and better teams will use this weakness against us like Arsenal and Manchester United did pretty effectively. Other teams like Newcastle and Aston Villa did this as well.

Money doesn't come for nothing, you'll struggle to find a donation without an ulterior motive.  

&gt; Shell donates just £200,000 ($306,000) a year to the Science Museum and in return gains a social legitimacy that it does not deserve, by presenting itself as a generous philanthropist.   

Globally Shell (via the shell foundation) donated $18,000,000 in 2013. If you look further at somewhere like Houston, TX, there are hundreds of petroleum sponsored facilities such as sports, youth clubs, museums, parks. they do donate a lot for the community.    

&gt; offshore drilling in the fragile Arctic, something only possible now that sea ice is rapidly diminishing   

Not true, it is mostly the advancement of technology of drill-ships and the cost of oil. As cost and demand increase it pushes companies like Shell to advance their research and go to new frontiers. Arctic drilling has been going since the 1960's.    

&gt; There is nothing comfortable about the world we will leave future generations if we fail to shift to a culture beyond oil. The Science Museum has the opportunity to stand up for the future of its visitors, both young and old, by cutting its ties to Shell and BP. If Ian Blatchford is serious about raising awareness of climate change in any meaningful way then his next action should be to end the museum’s relationship with the fossil fuel industry.   


Oil plays such a huge part in the development of the world and we wouldn't be where we are without oil on both a physical and financial scale. We have used oil in society since ancient history and we will continue to use it into the future. I actually agree we should be reducing our usage fossil fuels and be making our fossil fuels cleaner. But it is naive to believe that oil is something we can just move on from.

For starters, the United Kingdom isn't the same as the [British Isles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles). While historically, pissing off the Irish has been something of a national pastime for us (that would be an example of understatement right there), if you want to avoid doing the same, you might want to clarify your terminology. Personally, I'd say a fairly interesting presentation could be put together just based on the differences between, say, England, Britain, the United Kingdom, the British Isles and so on.

Historically speaking, it depends how far you want to go back. Some interesting highlights might include Roman Britain, the Viking invasion and the Norman Conquest where variously Italians who liked straight roads, hairy Scandinavians and some chaps from the continent decided to effect some regime change but ended up just complaining about the rain like everyone else. 

There was the Hundred Years War with France (where we came second), the War of the Roses (which we won and lost), King Henry VIII (big chap, many wives), the fending-off of the Spanish Armada in 1588... If we leap forward from there, there's the British Empire, which is the reason English has spread so widely around the world, despite the best efforts of *Two Broke Girls* to make ignorance of English more appealing. Even further forward, there are the world wars, decolonisation... And that's only an England-centric perspective. While all that was going on, our Scottish neighbours were slicing us open with claymores, hunting wild haggis over the highlands and doing wonderful things with deep fryers. Irish history, too, exists.

Geographically and natural historically speaking, you could look at the ice ages, the flora and fauna native to the islands-- someone else pointed out that quite a lot of stuff got brought over by the various people who have popped over to either stay for good or just a spot of light pillaging-- and maybe the different geological regions in the country.

Politically, all kinds of ~~really good~~ surprisingly adequate arrangements have come out of our rainy little island home. Our particular brand of parliamentary democracy, for instance, with its franchises all over the world.

Culturally, I'm sure I don't need to mention Shakespeare, Byron, Keats, Burns, Wilde, Turner, Elgar, Clarkson and all the other poets, authors, artists and so on who shaped British cultural identity.

Don't get ahead of yourself. It's one season.

Update:

She-Ra (admin of TSR):

&gt;Hi everyone, 

&gt;Edexcel have been in touch with us previously about international exams - however we were very clear with exam boards last year that this is predominately a student forum where UK students come together to revise and talk about their exams whenever and however this wish too. 

&gt;Mr M is not lying and I am in no doubt that the exam board will have contacted him directly - please don't be unpleasant to him - he does a huge amount for the students on this site and it's sad to see him getting stick from some of you.

&gt;We won't be moderating comments on today's exams because for the last 18 months new exam posting rules have been in place. It would be unfair of us to create new posting rules for today's exam and confusing for students who have become used to the way things work around here for the maths community. 

&gt;If you have any questions let me know  I hope you're exam went really well today and I'm sorry that you have been put in a position that means you feel silenced. 

&gt;She-Ra

And she's said since that an EU-exit would 'trigger' another one.

&gt;Only saying that there's room for debate either way.

There is indeed, always - but not to the extent of repeating referendums because someone didn't like the majority not agreeing with them.

&gt;You shouldn't just ignore their opinions.

And the SNP/ people generally shouldn't assume that another referendum is exactly what Scotland needs as if there wasn't one less than six months ago.

Uh that's not really what happened.

If a player doesn't want to track back and play defense that IS his fault. That's his choice.

Which mostly has to do with other players having a down season rather than De Bruyne being the best. I'd still rather have Reus or Gotze.

An Artist would have evidence of their work, a Scientist may have papers published or research undertaken, a manager may have qualifications, training or statistics that show improvement where they have worked. 

None of this is true for customer services, you can have previous experience, but it may be in a completely different environment e.g. moving from a small family owned hotel to a chain owned hotel will be very different. 

There is very little for the person doing the hiring (not usually a specific hiring manager as you mentioned earlier, do you think each branch of McDonald's has it's own personnel department?) to go on to show how good you will be at doing the job. That's why they get you to do the job to figure out how good you will be at it.

null,false,NiceyChappe,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"That one of the things that paradoxically seems to define Britain at the moment is a lack of collective identity. Unlike a lot of other modestly-sized countries we do not have a strong common culture, and unlike a lot of more populous countries we do not have a large geographic area. So where the USA has different states with different variations of culture but stronger local identities, that doesn't happen so much here, except for the furthest reaches like Scotland, Cornwall, Wales, Northern Ireland, the North. The islands themselves tend to have a stronger sense of identity than the mainland (isles in Scotland, Isle Of Man, etc).

In some ways we are too small for the subcultures to diverge too much, but we are in some ways too broadly pragmatic and plain to have a strongly defined culture; our national dishes are mostly modifications of foreign dishes, so our food is much like the language and the racial history, a glorious mishmash.

We have been both the invaded and the Empire, both poor and rich, the oppressor and the underdog. We pushed for the abolition of slavery, then a century later invented concentration camps, and then another few decades later fought another World War on the basis of high morals.

One of the things that defines the UK is the class system - the image of British people as English toffs or as Cockneys seems widespread, but it's more than some sort of wealth gap. It is a complex set of cultural differences which have become embedded in a collective view. In many ways the supposed history of the UK is really the history of an often foolish or cruel ruling class. The history of the common people is much more wry and restrained. 

Most British people I know have a distinct preference for the centre ground, for balance, neutrality, consistency. We are aware that if you veer too much in one direction you could become too much like America, or too much like the French, or the Germans or any other stereotype. Sometimes that encourages mediocrity; anything too exciting or difference is broadly mocked. Sometimes it is our saviour as we refuse to go down a path like fascism. We have reformed rather than revolted; we helped write other people's grand constitutions, but do not have one of our own.

In terms of human geography, we have some disadvantages compared to other European nations; unlike France, the weather, the capital, the industry all pull towards the south, so there is quite a polarisation to the country in terms of wealth. In France on the other hand, the industry and the politics is in the north, but the weather and the vineyards are in the south, so there is not the same bias.

I like the suggestion of the Shipping Forecast. It is a plain, nearly-unintelligible list of weather forecasts for the shipping regions around the UK. The names of the regions have historic origin, and the forecast itself is a product of a bygone age - it is broadcast on the highbrow BBC Radio4, an institution of high regard among the political classes and highbrow listeners; the forecast is a comforting presence to many people, a reminder of the stable and familiar. And yet we consider ourselves inventors, tinkerers and gadget lovers.

Indeed, as the most effective charities are really really good at helping people (curing children of parasitic worm infections for 50p each, or distributing anti-malarial bed nets for £3 each), that one would probably do more good by using the time that would otherwise be spend volunteering to earn more money and giving that away (as volunteering locally, though still a very good thing, does not really compare in terms of good done to working even minimum wage and giving your salary away to the best charities).

I feel that in an ideal world we would dedicate our resources to solving problems by amount of effort (or money) per amount of good provided, and if everyone was on board we would pretty quickly solve the vast majority of the most pressing, and would arrive back at a situation similar to what we have now in the developed world, but the quality of life for those in developing countries would be drastically improved.

Personally I think the big advantage of this type of property investment is that it gives you an active business with a spread of assets, so you're not invested in one giant block which you sit on long term and could take a massive hit.

Having said that, it's true that other types of investments give better returns. With a huge capital sum you can invest in stuff like commodity futures which are actually very safe but most people can't afford to buy. A good commodity futures portfolio could net you 5% above the current treasury bill rate (t-bills are a kind of government bond which is low yield but totally safe, so they're used as a baseline) and have minimal costs associated with them.

There's a middle ground though - commercial property.

&gt;play the same attacking midfield position

We still have a No 10, the difference is Mourinho expects that player to not play so far up the pitch. We often play a 4-2-3-1 and there is still a no 10 there, just different expectations. Mata didn't do what Mourinho wants *all* players on the pitch to do, and that's play defense and press up and down the pitch.

&gt;What do you call an attacking midfield position that is pushed back a bit and made into tracking back defensively, il give you a hint, A CENTER MIDFIELDER.

Oscar still plays as a no 10, not as a centre mid. 

&gt;Not being able to play out of position is hardly a fault.

Tracking back is not playing out of position. 

&gt;He isn't a center mid, he is a number 10.

Your entire logic is faulty. Hazard plays defense, but is still a winger. Playing defense doesn't mean you're playing a different position. Costa tracks back, still a forward.

&gt;Do you think Kagawa, Isco, Goetze, Mata, could play that role?

If they tracked back, yes.

&gt;You seem to love to hate ex players.

I don't hate them, I just recognize their faults.

&gt;It says a lot about your football intelligence if you think Oscar and KDB played the same role this season.

They both play as a no 10. They are both attacking midfielders. Oscar did not play center mid this season, he played as an attacking midfielder. Being tasked with playing defense doesn't change the position you play on the pitch.

&gt;De Bruyne and Oscar do not play the same role

They play the same position bud.

&gt;Oscar plays less attacking and more defensive,

Which is a product of our style and not his position. All our players do that. When we played weaker teams and pressed a lot, which was *most* games, Oscar was definitely not ""further back"" or playing as a centre mid.

&gt;even covering for Fabregas at times

Every player does that. Even Matic covers at CB if Terry or Cahill were pushed up. Covering a position doesn't change your initial position on the pitch.

&gt;You know nothing about football.

Says the guy who doesn't think Oscar is a no 10. We play a 4-2-3-1 formation. Oscar played in the center of the 3. If you think that makes him a centre mid then you must also think that makes Willian and Hazard centre mids. You have no clue how that formation works.

I reckon under 6 is very very doable! It just takes some determination on the day. My companion was struggling with pain on downhills so we couldn't run as much as we wanted. There was easily room for improvement.

Under 5 is easily achievable as well - you just need to keep plodding the whole way. 

It's all about the hill training! You want a decent level of fitness, but you don't need to be running a replica of the main event. As much as anything you want to strengthen your body and joints so they're used to the ups and downs. 

Whilst training, make sure you use the kit you'll be using on the day before you get to the date! You don't want a new pair of shorts that rub in an awkward spot, or a bag that doesn't fit quite right. So they should get some decent outings before hand.

In the last week you shouldn't do much training at all. It gives your body a chance to fully recover and leaves you in the best state.

When it comes to the big day, if you're in a decent state of fitness (in particular for the recovery aspect), and make sure you keep hydrated and fueled, you can drop the pace from your training and just keep going and going.

Fuel is very very important. After about an hour and a half / 2 hours you'll run out of carbs. If you're carrying your water, I'd suggest getting something like [this stuff](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Science-Sport-GO-Electrolyte-1600g/dp/B000OBYIG2/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433768378&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=carbohydrate+powder), and using a bladder to keep sipping the whole day. You can't just drink water. Need the salts and other stuff you're using as well.

You can also get energy gels and then just have plain water. Same idea, just delivered differently.

I for one haven't forgotten the countless times he failed to make a simple 5 yard pass or when he would run with the ball, fumbling over it in an attempt to dribble past players, when it worked he looked as shocked as everyone else and didn't know what to do with it afterwards or, this was more often the case, would run straight into the player or into a dead end and lose the ball.

I wanted him to stay over Salah, simply cause they were the exact same player but Moses at least would, somehow, get you goals. I don't think he's good enough at all though and his performances at Stoke haven't convinced me otherwise. 

Chances of him being here next season are slim but if he was happy with being backup and we weren't going to use one of our youth players to fill the gap at right wing then I would keep him for sentimental value (reminds me of the Oscar, Mata, Hazard days where we destroyed every defence).

null,false,CharlieDeBeadle,null,null,null,"I think it should be grams divided by density.  

    density = grams / volume
    grams given, volume wanted
    
the wrong way:

    grams * density = grams * grams / volume
    grams * grams / volume = (grams^2) / volume
    
the right way (I think):

    grams / density = grams / (grams / volume)
    grams / (grams / volume) = grams * (volume / grams)
    = volume

this is because:

    a / b = a * (1 / b)
    e.g. a/2 = a * 1/2

Now if we make b a fraction, say x / y:

    b = x / y
    1 / b = 1 / (x / y)

when you have 1 over a fraction, you just flip the fraction:

    1 / x / y = y / x
    a / b = a * (y / x)

so if we make a = the grams, and b = the density (think of grams as being the x used before, and volume being the y from before):

    a / b = a * 1 / b
    grams / density = grams * 1 / density
    density = grams / volume
    grams * (1 / grams / volume) = grams * (volume / grams)  

and then they just cancel out, to give you the volume.

*It is useful for estimating costs because it contains costs you may not have otherwise thought of. It doesn't actually give any directs costs as such. The notable absences are costs for food &amp; transport. Other costs, more discretionary, would be shopping, entertainment (games/drink/food), holidays &amp; presents.

**There are also a lot of one-off costs when moving house which should be taken into account. These can be rental deposits, mortgage deposits, fees and even furniture.

The figure of 1,200 deaths is often cited - but how reliable is it?

&gt;Living and working conditions for some migrants in Qatar are appalling. Long hours in the blazing heat, low pay and squalid dormitories, are a daily ordeal for thousands - and they cannot leave without an exit visa.
Qatar is clearly worried about stories getting out about the workers' suffering. A BBC team was arrested there just last month.
And many workers have died. A graphic published last week in the Washington Post now doing the rounds on social media contrasts the relatively small numbers who died building facilities for other recent international sporting competitions - from the Beijing Olympics to the Brazil World Cup - with the 1,200 said to have died already in Qatar.

But where does that figure come from, and how was it calculated?

&gt;It was first published in 2013 in a report by the International Trades Union Confederation, called The Case Against Qatar.
The ITUC went to the embassies of Nepal and India, two countries which are the source of many of the migrant workers who go to Qatar. Those embassies had counted more than 400 deaths a year between them - a total of 1,239 deaths in the three years to the end of 2013.

&gt;Deaths in Qatar


* **Nation 2011	2012	2013**
* Indian	239	237	241
* Nepali	162	169	191
* Total	401	406	432
* Source: ITUC			


&gt;But Nepal and India account for only about 60% of the estimated 1.4m migrant workers in Qatar, so the total number of migrant worker deaths is certain to be higher.
The law firm DLA Piper, which was commissioned by the Qatari government to look into the issue, was given similar estimates for deaths of Indian and Nepali workers. It also obtained figures for the deaths of Bangladeshi workers - taking the death toll to almost 1,800 across the three years, or 600 a year.

But this would still be only part of the story, as Qatar is host to large numbers of migrant workers from other countries, from Egypt to the Philippines.
These workers aren't all building World Cup facilities, however. In fact most of them aren't.
A lot of them are construction workers building - well, pretty much anything that needs to be built around Qatar.


&gt;The ITUC believes that counting all construction work is legitimate.
It says that although the first World Cup stadium was only started last year, subways, hotels, and even an entire city are currently being built, not to mention an airport, numerous roads, a new sewerage system in central Doha and 20 skyscrapers.
""It needs to be remembered that the infrastructure programme in Qatar is entirely built around the delivery date of the World Cup in Qatar,"" says Tim Noonan, director of campaigns at the ITUC.

But it's hard to argue that if there been no World Cup in Qatar there would have been no construction. Qatar's economy tripled in size between 2005 and 2009, and a construction boom was already under way before the country was awarded the 2022 World Cup. To blame football for all the construction deaths in the country is surely stretching it.
Another factor that needs to be taken into account is that, according to one estimate, a third of migrant workers in Qatar don't even work in construction. The ITUC, though, is counting the deaths of workers in any line of work and from any cause, including road accidents and heart attacks.
Some would argue that it was a bad idea to hand the World Cup to a country where so many migrant workers are dying - even if some are dying on construction projects unconnected with the World Cup, and others are dying in unrelated sectors of the economy.
**But the Indian Government says in a press release: ""Considering the large size of our community, the number of deaths is quite normal.""
The point officials are making is that there are about half a million Indian workers in Qatar, and about 250 deaths per year - and this, in their view, is not a cause for concern. In fact, Indian government data suggests that back home in India you would expect a far higher proportion to die each year - not 250, but 1,000 in any group of 500,000 25-30-year-old men. Even in the UK, an average of 300 for every half a million men in this age group die each year.**

&gt;Tim Noonan from the ITUC believes the comparison is misleading. The migrant workers in Qatar are not only young, they are fit. ""Qatar requires them to be given a medical examination to screen them for pre-existing conditions, so this is comparing apples and pears,"" he says.
Of course, India is a very poor country and Qatar is a very rich country - the richest in the world in terms of GDP per capita - so it's perfectly reasonable to say that Qatar should do better by its migrant workers. But then it is.
So is the figure of 1,200 Qatar World Cup deaths just meaningless? No, says Tim Noonan. He denies the ITUC came up with the figure just to get headlines. In fact he thinks the real figure may well be higher.
""To describe a problem is the correct thing to do,"" he says. ""And we believe we've described it accurately and conservatively.""",null,0,null,1433770888,null,0,false,0,crzeth7,null,t3_3908sd,null,t1_crzeth7,null,t3_3908sd,null,null,null,1436820393,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

This is all according Tony Barrett (Extremely reliable for Liverpool)

The plan is to have Sturridge, Ings and another striker. The top target is Benteke.

Borini has been told he isn't part of our plans and is already in talks with Lazio, Lambert has been told he can leave for more playing time if he wishes. Balotelli will be sold if we can find buyers and Sampdoria have already offered to take him on loan with some of his wages paid by us. 

Origi is coming back, but he's been mainly used as a winger in his club career so he's likely not to be starting upfront. 

With Sturridge, Ings and another striker, that is a clear plan to me. 

With Europa and cup games and the variables seasons throw at you like injuries, fatigue, suspensions and drop in forms as well as we are likely to play two upfront at times like from the 13/14 season should provide ample opportunity for all 3 with a backup option of Origi. 

Ings is also a perfect fit for our system. We played Sterling upfront because we like to press from the front. But doing that sacrificed threat going forward as Sterling's finishing leaves a lot to be desired, he misses a strikers instinct and lacks the physicality to challenge defenders. 

Ings presses hard from the front and is actually a goal threat. Exactly what we need.

As things stand, Aston Villa have lost Cleverly and could loss Benteke and Vlaar. This is Sherwood's first ever transfer window, so no one can even predict what kind of players we could see at Aston Villa. Sherwood wants to sell a lot of players, which is removing a lot of structure from the team. Those boots can be filled, but as things stand, it looks as though there could be a lot of additions. Some will flourish, some will not. But with a lot of new additions, fans will have to wait and allow the team to gel.

From the names we have been linked with, they are solid and known BPL players. Which isn't a bad thing, what worries me is that Sherwood and Aston Villa may end up paying over their transfer fee which could bring Villa back to MON days.

I'm going to wait and remain patient, because I just don't know what the future holds for Villa. Which is why I haven't been posting for a while, that and I still haven't really recovered from the FA Cup final defeat.

Conversely, one of my friends in school froze up in exams. She could write page after page of material explaining the hows, the whys, and the whats, but you sit her in an exam hall and the pressure makes her mind go blank. So she suffers for that.

Homework was very similar. My classwork was great, demonstrated a clear understanding, but my homework was utterly terrible, and it contributed to a severe and longstanding, ongoing, battle with deep depression. I was in trouble at school for my bad homework, and I was in trouble at home for being in trouble at school. I was miserable 24/7. I never bunked off or anything, because that would only risk my mum getting in severe trouble, and so I stayed miserable for five years of my life.

null,false,Sharwdry,null,null,null,"There are actually lots of places where that TED Talk falls down, and a few facts it fails to address. Firstly, it pre-supposes that paying more money gets better people, well if we want to look at the truth of that we can look at CEOs- how do their performances scale with pay? Well the answer we tend to find in research is better paid CEOs tend to take higher risks and their companies tend to perform *worse* on average. So actually more money isn't getting you better people, it's just getting you more expensive people. 


Secondly, the assumption that a charity taking a lot of money is a *successful* charity. That's not true, there really isn't much total market growth for charity - the total money going to charity doesn't change hugely year on year. If your charity therefore boosts it's fundraising efforts and gets more money, you are almost certainly actually taking money away from another chairty - and paradoxically you're spending less of that money on your goals, and more on raising charity. This fundamentally undermines his point, the money isn't the measure here, a successful charity is one that acheives its goals with very little money, not spends alot of money on goals it doesnt' acheive. 

By definition then, a well paid group of people working at a charity run an immediate deficit - you could be hiring cheaper people and more of the money would go to charity. Now obviously, you have to draw a line, you want smart effective people, but do we pay for that? Well again, scientific experiments tend to show remuneration doesn't increase performance for anything  but the most basic of tasks. The smart motivated people where they feel they make a difference and care about what they're doing, the money is secondary. So again, we come to the conclusion, by paying more you're attracting the people who aren't going to be good for the job. Charity has one huge bonus that big business doesn't- they can hire people who actually believe in the project, rather than compete on pay.

&gt;__Gift Aid__ is a UK [tax incentive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_incentive) that enables [tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax)-effective giving by individuals to [charities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization) in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom). Gift Aid was introduced in the [Finance Act 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Act_1990) for donations given after 1 October 1990, but was originally limited to cash gifts of £600 or more. This threshold was successively reduced in April 2000 when the policy was substantially revised and the minimum donation limit removed entirely. A similar policy applies to charitable donations by companies that are subject to the [UK corporation tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_corporation_tax).

Tell a story fundamentally connected to the British Isles.

Arthurian Legend: King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, or The Fisher King.

There are variations on the story for different parts of the British Isles you might want to focus on (so as to not exclude Ireland), and you can relate it back to other countries to authors like Chrétien de Troyes so it can be seen as a Norman vision of the history of the British Isles, [a later  Sir Thomas Malory romanticised version](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Morte_d%27Arthur) or to Percival and a more Germanic interpretation, with [Arthur's Red Dragon seen as a symbol fighting the White Dragon of the Saxons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_Regum_Britanniae#Books_Nine_and_Ten).

I'd go more for the romantic aspect, but if your brief is more about a geographic aspect of the British Isles, then you can follow geographic places and influences around the British Isles as you tell the story, going from Tintagel to the present day where a round table hangs in the Great Hall in Winchester.

The extra support that clubs have is largely based on their success. Celtic and Rangers have been by far the most successful clubs throughout history so they get extra supporters all over the country. Mostly in areas outside of the other big cities where fans may not feel drawn towards another 'big team'. So in your small towns you'll have a portion of people supporting the local lower league team, a portion supporting the nearest premier league team and a portion supporting rangers or Celtic.

There are some anomalies to this. In the 1980s, Aberdeen and Dundee United were very successful so a lot of people outside of their respective cities chose to support those teams.

Due to rising house prices in the counties cities, a lot of people move out of town to smaller villages but continue to support the same team and then pass that support onto their children, this leads to more people in satellite towns supporting clubs from the bigger cities.

In the cities with 2 traditionally 'big' teams, the main deciding factors are which ground you live closer too and who your family has traditionally supported. The vast majority of football and in Scotland will support the same team as their father/uncle/grandfather/older brother.

Lastly, there's religion.

You can U-turn in 5th, if you feel brave enough. Correct placement of clutch and enough revs - sounds horrible, but you'll see it through. Just takes practice.  
Not that you want to, just that it's doable.

My Mod-1 training had us do that, just to show that you don't need to panic if you're in the wrong gear.

He'd probably cost £20m + £15.6m wages (2 years @ £150 000/week) = £35.6m and he'd leave on a free in 2 years time.

Also, I'm not too sure how effective he is as a lone striker - he's had success playing off Berbatov/Aguero/Llorente/Morata, so it could mean 2 upfront - presumably a diamond with Coutinho, Lallana, Sterling, Markovic and Ibe vying for 1 spot. That also means Ings or Origi starting regularly unless Sturridge's thighs become magically cured.

&gt; The first German national anthem used the melody of ""God Save The King"" with the words changed to Heil dir im Siegerkranz, and sung to the same tune as the UK version. The tune was either used or officially adopted as the national anthem for several other countries, including those of Russia (Molitva russkikh, until 1833) and Switzerland (Rufst Du, mein Vaterland or Ô monts indépendants, until 1961).  ""God Save The King"" was used as the national anthem of the Kingdom of Hawaii before 1860, and from 1860 to 1886 the national anthem E Ola Ke Alii Ke Akua was set to the same melody.  The melody is used in the American patriotic hymn ""My Country, 'Tis of Thee"", the lyrics of which were written by Samuel Francis Smith in 1831. ... It is Norway's royal anthem titled Kongesangen. It was the Swedish royal anthem between 1805 and 1880, titled Bevare Gud vår kung.   The tune—that was in use for the Swiss National Anthem Rufst du, mein Vaterland until 1961—is still used as the national anthem of Liechtenstein, Oben am jungen Rhein. The same tune was therefore played twice before the Euro 96 qualifying match between Northern Ireland and Liechtenstein; likewise when England played Liechtenstein in a Euro 2004 qualifier. (When England play Northern Ireland, the tune is only played once.) ... The tune is also used for the anthem of the ""Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen"" in The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show.",null,0,null,1433774718,null,0,false,0,crzgqd0,null,t3_38xoad,null,t1_crzgqd0,null,t1_crz8bgx,null,null,null,1436821662,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I wouldn't be surprised if we lost Lucas and Allen and in that case we would need another midfielder, but as it stands now I think we're fine. Moreno is a good LB for me, we need another RB such as Clyne and I do think we'll sign one. As for CBs we have skrtel, sakho, toure, and Lovren plus Can and Wisdom if it gets rough.

- The ever closer union phrase is not a binding agreement. Were there to be a new treaty, like Lisbon, we'd be able to veto it.
- In work benefits are so insignificant, they cost basically no money at all in the grand scheme of things. That being said, it's an issue we can solve ourselves by putting some requirements on them, like having to of lived in the UK for 3 years before claiming, or working here for 1 year. As long as those requirements were given to UK citizens too it would be within EU law.
- National parliaments already have powers to block EU legislation both via the yellow card system (1/3rd parliaments can cause immediate vote in council) or via the council itself. 
- We can veto new members joining the EU
- So leaving the EU, would that create more or less red tape. I can guarantee you right now it will create more as the whole damn point of the EU is to reduce red tape &amp; differences in business standards. Leaving the single market would make business much more difficult.
- This one I don't know much about but either way it doesn't really impact me
- This one makes sense but I don't see why we need to threaten to leave to get something so obvious.

""Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.”  But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.  The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband.  For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.  Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control."" (1 Corinthians 7:1-5)

Essentially, the Corinthian Church wrote to Paul saying that ""it is better not to marry"".  Paul says no, you should get married because sex is pretty tempting and God wants it to be done within the context of marriage.  Then he says that, once you are married, you should be having sex as much as you want it and you shouldn't deprive each other of it - even if you're not in the mood but she is.  

Later in the chapter, Paul goes on to say that he wished everyone was like him - able to remain single to dedicate themselves to God (v. 7)  He acknowledges, however, that what he has is a gift from God (v. 7 again) and most people aren't like that which is why he says that it 'is better to marry' (v.9)

I don't think it's quite as simple as saying that Paul was anti-sexual relationships.  Indeed, looking the Song of Solomon, I think it's pretty clear that God is not anti-sex, He just has some rules for it (which essentailly boils down to being within marriage).

But I suspect you're asking a slightly different question? Whether the Conservatives will always govern (more-or-less forever) if there is no opposition party.

Technically, it's entirely possible, but it's extremely unlikely that Labour will somehow vanish off the political radar. They received over 9 million votes and control approximately one-third of the Commons, they may be struggling to decide their next steps but they are still a major force in UK politics.

Ah yeah, you've used this one before and it's bull. So many players have gotten much better after the age of 23 it's ridiculous to even claim they don't. Alonso, Gerrard, Carragher, Henderson, Suarez, Reina, Mascherano, Lucas, Lallana, Lambert and countless others which haven't played for us. A players peak is not bloody 23, it's between 25-30 for a striker, 26-32 for a midfielder and 27-33 for a defender in most cases.

Benteke was injured through the world cup so that's not right either, Lukaku also had a niggling ankle injury too, so it's not like he started over them because he was better. 

I really do like the look of Ings, much more than Borini, Lambert or Balotelli. I said back then they weren't good enough and didn't fit our system, but I do like Ings, I think he's capable of being a great player for us.

He has the right traits for it.

I think this passage underlines my point, Paul was fairly anti-sex but understood the faults of humanity, thus he selected the lesser of two evils in the hope that it would be deemed enough. 
Paul's theology (if one can call his thought patters developed enough to have a clear and consistent theology) was essentially one of compromise. This can pretty clearly be seen with his ""justification by faith"", that the law is still good yet seemingly impossible for total obedience by the gentiles and so he is forced to invent a clever workaround. If you look at Paul's thought he always seems to take the middle ground but in order to strike at the heart of what his ideas really were, you need to look at the actions he practised himself.
Also it's not a great idea to quote the song of solomon, it espouses early second temple ideas of marriage and anyway lots/most of Christian ethical teaching isn't rooted in texts from the second temple period apart from maybe eschatology.

The sheer engineering, design, financial, regulatory, and most importantly scientific unfeasibility of this proposal is mind boggling.

A light Aircraft equipped with a parachute system like the Cirrus S22 is 1.6 tons. It was designed from the outset to be equipped with a BRS. 

The maximum take off weight for the Airbus A380, for example, is 590 tons.

590 tons. That's the equivalent of about 7000 people. 

And then talk of a detachable Wingbox to jettison the Wings. Christ. A fuselage without wings if lucky becomes a lawn dart, if not it would enter a phenomena called a flat spin which would be fatal as there is no longer any pitch/roll/thrust control with the wings and engines gone to try and get out if it. Parachutes would probably aggravate it further.
