&gt;

&gt;__Cabot Tower__ is a [tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower) in [Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol), England, situated in a public park on [Brandon Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Hill,_Bristol), between the [city centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_city_centre), [Clifton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton,_Bristol) and [Hotwells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotwells). It is a grade II [listed building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building).  

&gt;The 105 feet (32Â m) high tower was built, on the site of a previous chapel and windmill, in the 1890s to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the journey of [John Cabot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cabot) from Bristol to land which later became Canada. Public access to the viewing platforms at the top of the tower via the staircase was stopped in 2007 as it had become unsafe. It reopened in 2011.

So, let's say the deficit (filled by borrowing) is more likely to be EUR 250bn it's only going to take a few years to build that debt back up to where it was before default (especially given the interest rates in play), making the whole exercise pointless, ruining the economy, surrendering a sovereign currency and generally making a balls-up of the country.

And after he played great (to prove how good he was), his effort on the field dramatically reduced and he went back to being uninspired and not producing.

Bobby on the other hand, seems to give his all every time, plays defense, and seems to have a good rapport with the on field players. While not scoring goals at the rate we want him to, his movement on the field and build up play are still there.

I personally think Soldado is better than Ade, but if you disagree with that, we can both agree neither is currently playing to their ability. I think the problem most people have is that for one of them its for lack of trying.

I don't hate Adebayor like many people seem to, but I also am not in favor of his perceived effort on the field, and would always start him behind Kane and Soldado. I think the only excuse to ever boo a player of our own is for lack of effort, but I also disagree with the amount of hatred going towards him, like you said - there isn't a need for that.

&gt; &gt;Rape has a higher conviction rate than most almost any other type of crime

&gt;&gt;Yes, there is a slightly higher conviction rate for sexual offences

&gt;Thank you.My claim is correct idiot.

No, once again, your claim is false, sexual offences =!= rape.

What I consider rape has nothing to do with it, the law is what matters here. 

Lower the burden of proof? Sexual violence cases, especially rape often come down to someone's word against another's, lowering the burden of proof could in theory catch more sex offenders, however this would also increase the number of people wrongly accused and perhaps even convicted.

Sexual violence cases are incredibly emotional things in this world, understandably, however the law must remain un-emotional and impartial. Start a petition by all means to lower the burden of proof, laws can be changed by the populace if there is enough support - no politician will go against that. Just bear in mind that professionals in law enforcement; police, lawyers, judges etc, have looked at these laws and they are worded and carried out how they are for good reason.

The key thing is to eliminate any stigma around people who have been sexually assaulted and offer complete support - if you are a victim of crime you have no obligation to go to court and help the prosecution, however in sexual assault case many are embarrassed / worried that they wont be believed. This is the more pressing issue that *needs* to be fixed.

The number of rapes jumping 31% in a year does not mean that people in England have lost their moral compass and are assaulting people everywhere, it means that the support mechanisms and structures for victims of sexual violence are improving and people are more 'happy' to come forward.

&gt; Agreed. We need to make massive cuts and reforms.

I'm more for revenue hikes. I think capital gains should be the same as income tax. I don't understand why those making money with money should pay less than those making money with themselves. If I have an opportunity to be crazy I'd also suggest nationalising accounting for various reasons that would probably result in a can of worms.

&gt; You can't have Labour's preferred level of spending without a strong economy to pay for it. 

That's Keynesian economics mate. You increase public spending to exit a recession then you save during the good times. Its an economic theory.

&gt; The right balance is fiscal conservatism with social liberalism and a strong safety net.

Like I said, economic **theory**. None of these answers are right or wrong because we can't count all the beans and actually turn it into maths. All we can count are the beans that people say they have and people aren't so reliable which leads to crazy distortion. Now we have no idea how many beans there are so we just theorise about how the beans work.

&gt; If we adopted half of what the Greens wanted to do then the economy would tank and they would have no way to pay for it.

Maybe. I'm not so certain, y'see economics is humans and humans are fucking counter intuitive. The ""basic income"" for example might be something that ends up working out for unforeseen reasons. You give enough people that extra breathing room and maybe those that now have time to write a killer musical or start their own business or invent some crazy contraption will outstrip all the dossers eating doritos on their couch. It hasn't been tried so its not like we have previous examples we can point to and say:

If Merlin could have found a way sooner to tell Arthur (like when he was being judged and was offered the chance to accept magic and Merlin told him not to), maybe he would have listened to Merlin and he could have told him he had heard prophecies and such. Also, after Merlin was right about pretty much everything all the time and all of his ""feelings"" and suspicions were right, Arthur probably should have listened to him more. He seemed to lend more credence to what he said in the last season, but not quite enough

I mean, I guess the only consolation for me is that Arthur wasn't really who he was supposed to be.

I feel as if people see Cahill making a last ditch slide tackle/block and think of how good he is. Cahill is excellent in these moments where has no time to think and instinct takes over. However, the only reason he has to do these things is because his positioning on the field is inferior to Terry. Sure, Terry makes blocks/last ditch challenges but he does much less frequently than Cahill does.

In Spain, you get captain by the length of time (seniority) that you are with the club. At Real Madrid it's Casillas, Ramos and then Ronaldo due to seniority. With Barcelona, the players vote for their four captains (who are mostly seniors with the team). 

With the British, it's less seniority and more about leadership. He's the one who can do a General Patten on people's arses if they're larking about on the field, and if the referee has an issue with your player, you're the one to go and try and smooth the way.

He was an outcast under AVB, out of favour. As AVB started to recieve criticism and face more and more pressure, Ade was seen as a potential saviour and failing to bring him in to try and solve our goal crisis was seen as another one of AVB's failings. He was then given an opportunity to come back. He performed and played a significant role in our successes in the 2nd half of the season. 

BUT he didn't do enough to garner the total support of the fans. Bring on this season and he hasn't put in the effort. More importantly, he is on 100k (maybe 140k, I'm not sure). For that much, you expect at least someone who tries hard. When the fanbase expected a new Spurs based around fast play, Ade. is the play who has held up our tempo. He slows down our moves and ruins attacks which we are now completing with Kane. Not what you expect from someone with a salary fitting a star player. 

Throw in his bad attitude and the fact a 22 year old newbie has done what we wanted a well trained professional with Real Madrid on CV him. 

Giving him the captain's armband was obviously going to piss the fanbase on unless he puts in a shift. You pay Â£40 or w/e to go see your team play, a team you are dedicated to.....and the captain you hoped would resurrect your team or at least earn his salary, puts in less effort and a bunch of young-uns on a third the money, then of course he deserves a bit of shit. 

That's my personal view though. I wanted him gone last summer and still thing he should go. I've no time for people with a bad attitude. At least put on a smile, admit your faults and promise to work hard and give that fans, the manager, the board, what they deserve.

1) Reform the job center completely making finding suitable work for it's users it's number one priority and allow it to have control over its own funds locally. You should be able to walk into the job center and have options straight away which will help you get back into work immediately with a personalized supportive approach to suit each individual working in unison with social services and the NHS.


2) Abolish unpaid internships, allow work experience for up to one month and subsidise participants (allow them to keep JSA) encourage companies to use it. Long enough to be useful for the individual, short enough to not be open to rampant abuse and the preserve of those rich enough to be supported by parents. 


3) Create a number of intensive schemes that underemployed/unemployed graduates can sign up to offering further skills and grading that companies work with to find potential employees. 


4) Big funding for increased places for medical training so we can be self sufficient in the NHS without having to rely on expensive agency staff and immigrant workers. 


5) Increases in minimum wage and a higher rate per hour if you are on a zero hours contract. 


6) More focus on local enterprise centres and support for people setting up a new business. Ability to borrow the equivalent of student loan on the same terms would be ideal. 


7) Program that helps unemployed people move to different parts of the country for employment if they want to and their local area has supply outstripping demand. 


8) Incentives for companies that offer further training and up skilling within the workplace. 


9) Policy that encourages business to be located here (i.e competitive corp tax) 


10) Big funding for science and technology research, making us a world leader and encouraging future generations that the jobs will be there if you train in these subjects.

&gt; ""Many of these people who are out there committing rape are serial rapists and sometimes people feel there isn't enough evidence to go forward on my case alone, but actually when lots of people come forward you begin to build up a very big picture.

&gt; ""But when you have anonymity for that rapist - or potential rapist - you protect him.""

&gt; Human rights barrister John Cooper added: ""Anonymity for sex crime victims is unworkable. Why should somebody who is accused of a sex crime receive anonymity? Why don't we broaden that out to include people who are accused of beating children or murdering children?

&gt; ""There's no distinguishing case for sex crimes to be singled out, it has to be anonymity for all or anonymity for none.""

&gt; Ruth Hall, a spokeswoman for Women against Rape, said the proposal would stop women coming forward to report rapes by propagating the notion that many allegations are false.

&gt; ""The people here all found it an insult to the women who are raped,"" she said. ""With a 6.5% conviction rate for rape and so many women not getting justice, all they are putting forward is anonymity for the men who rape us.

&gt; ""They should pay attention to the 94% of reported cases that do not end in conviction rather than the few that are false. It will just support the idea that women are making false allegations.""

&gt; Hall said that, while false allegations were rare, they tended to attract a great deal of publicity. ""Being falsely accused of rape is a terrible ordeal, but the same could be said of being falsely accused of murder or fraud,"" she said.

&gt; ""We don't want to see men accused of rape getting special protection that people don't get for other crimes. Anonymity for men has already been tried, but then police said it hindered their investigations, because they could not put out calls for women who had been raped by the same man.""

&gt; She added: ""This is just another way to try to stop the tide of women reporting rape.""

The FT City Network was established in the autumn of 2014 as an invitation-only panel of more than 50 of the Cityâs top financiers. In the second of the forumâs monthly online debates, we asked members for their views on the year ahead. In particular, how do they rank the biggest risks for 2015 â the UK election; monetary policy challenges; the oil price; Russia; terrorism. Here is the exchange in full.**


Xavier Rolet, London Stock Exchange

I would suggest that the greatest risks to the City are:

1) Uncompetitive financial regulation
2) The old European demons: ie a rise in nationalism/anti-immigration/protectionism which cannot coexist/support the needs of an international financial centre on a scale achieved by the City. We live in extraordinary times. Is Europe led by extraordinary politicians?
3) Popular disaffection for capitalism could kill the nascent UK tech revolution
Iâm afraid I see no prospects for rate rises anywhere in 2015 (other than special cases such as Russia).
I regard the decline in oil prices as a strong positive reflecting the fact that Saudi Arabia is no longer a swing producer, but also of the beginning of long-term structural shifts in the Energy markets.
The impact of new technologies everywhere is also being underestimated

Politicians just reflect who we are: fears are running high and so is the temptation to retrench. Europeâs political record in the last 150 years is nothing but disastrous.

Key question for me is: will the current stress lead us down the same path, or will a real and global political governance (UN-based or otherwise) emerge this time around and achieve Peace and Security?

Guy Hands, chief executive, Terra Firma

I think the biggest risk for the City this year is the political uncertainty that would be created by an inconclusive general election.

Labour will do too badly to form a government. We could very easily have a second election in October. If Labour do get into power I would be very concerned about punitive attacks on the City. People are waking up to the fact that the benefits of globalisation have not been spread evenly and there is a lot of hostility out there to financial services. We could see the sort of tax rises that would have other international financial centres rubbing their hands in glee.
I do not think the volatility created by oil price movements or the crisis in Ukraine will hurt the City â in fact quite the opposite, the City can often benefit from such volatility. I do worry about Europeâs ongoing economic malaise and the divisiveness of the question of European Union membership in British politics but I believe that is more of an issue for 2016-17 than 2015. The Conservatives will get the most votes but not enough seats for a majority

Manny Roman, chief executive, Man Group

I think it is very straightforward:
1. The UK election is a real risk. The Labour party is seen as very anti-business and investors will fear a repeat of Hollande. That means cable trading around 1.45 and the FTSE underperforming. This is an Ed Miliband risk more than a labour risk. Obviously any weak government is also a problem.

2. The more oil goes down the better it is for the economy and the world and for a solution to Ukraine. I am (fairly) relaxed about this. That said, a real oil crash will mean significant dislocation in the credit market, in banks and in equity valuation for the sector. Hard to âgaugeâ how bad it can hurt but thatâs a definite worry.
3. Rates are to remain low in the world for a long time. Welcome to Naritaâ¦..
4. I think terrorism is a real risk. Some criminal just shot 10 journalists and two cops because of their satirical cartoon of Mohamed. From what we can hear, the shooters were totally trained and spoke perfect French. I am very surprised nothing like this has happened in London.
John Cridland, director-general, CBI
The biggest risk undoubtedly is political uncertainty. In the UK, with six parties instead of three, the outcome of the election is more uncertain than for any election since 1992. Bookend that with referendums â one on Scottish independence that we thought was behind us on the 18th September but now doesnât look as if it is, and one on membership of the EU that increasingly looks like itâs ahead of us irrespective of who wins the election â and you get a cocktail of uncertainty.
There is also a cocktail of uncertainty globally. A year ago, the only real political risk was in east Asia. Isis, Crimea, Ebola werenât on the agenda.
The biggest non-political risk today is the eurozone. The deflation figures show that. There is sluggishness in France, a slowdown in Germany and the need for quantitative easing.
The irony of all this is that it comes at a time when the prospects and underpinnings of the UK economy are really quite strong. You talk to most financiers and thereâs a lot of M&amp;A activity, a lot of IPOs, a lot of investment going on. Weâve moved from commercial risk dominating corporate risk registers to political risk dominating corporate risk registers.

Dame Alison Carnwath, chairman Land Securities

There is little doubt in my mind that the real prospect of an inconclusive election and the ghastly possibility of a second general election as well as a possible EU referendum will result in fatigue with politics and short term policy sound bites.

Business will be wanting to plan and execute for the longer term and the political headache in the UK may unsettle capital markets and possibly affect the jobs market. Exchange rates are likely to be volatile and so generally execution of strategic plans and delivering consistent growth will be challenging.

However London is not alone in having to digest uncertainty and policy errors. In fact compared to Europe we are better placed and hence from a relative perspective London should do OK. Adjustments will need to be made to react to the oil price but London and the markets generally have been here before.

It is important that business remains focused on their long term goals and ploughs through the uncertainties to achieve resilience and transformation of business models which are being driven more and more by changes in technology.

Ken Costa, financier

1. In the UK the key risk is clearly the election. I am however more sanguine than most commentators. It seems to me that there is a credible probability for an outright Conservative majority. In many ways the election could be similar to the Scottish referendum where the final stages of the campaign concentrated the minds of voters in a very clear and targeted way. When the electorate makes its final choices after Easter I believe that they will make this choice on the basis of leadership, in which Cameron has the advantage. Even in the marginals the risk of the unknown will lead to a vote for safety first. Two factors further persuade me that the electorate will go for safety rather than risk. By then the feel/better factor will be more widely spread and global political instability will still be a cause for concern. The risk weighted judgment will therefore tend to be defensive.

The greater risk is that whichever party â or combination of parties â forms the new government, the resulting administration will be weak. This will make it more difficult to implement the much talked of but not executed deficit reduction plan.

2. At the macro level I suspect that the decline in oil prices will be stabilising around current levels. This will result in improved margins across the consumer sector as these savings feed through to the bottom line.
3. Volatility in financial markets is likely to continue as we may well see a correction in stock markets following their recent strength occurring at the same time as political uncertainly arises in Europe (Grexit), deferred or fudged QE and uncertainly over the UKâs position in Europe.

4. The social effects of the strong US Dollar on the economies of the emerging markets is a significant risk in these countries given the levels of unemployment that will result from the rise in the US Dollar

There is a major political risk reflecting the inability of politicians to map out a modus vivendi within countries with culturally diverse communities. The terrorist threat better planned, better executed and with social media momentum is real and present. At a time of strong economic performance these uncertainties would not be as significant as they are likely to be given the weakness of global economic prospects.",null,0,null,1421939684,null,0,1421940135,0,cnx7xgq,null,t3_2takg3,null,t1_cnx7xgq,null,t3_2takg3,null,null,null,1424456976,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt;Even the last PL game Poch would rather try Dembele out on the right than start with Townsend which I think says it all.

So? Did Townsend pick up a knock? Maybe he wasn't fit for 60 minutes of play or 90? Maybe he woke up with a bad stomach. Maybe Poch saw an opportunity to take. You're assuming Dembele having to play out wide is a reflection of Townsends ability to play the position and not the many other circumstances that could be. 

Sure, but between Lamela, Townsend, Lennon and some of the academy products we have, we're not getting one. We're not City or United who can drop an inflated January fee for a winger who also is competing for a that role every week. We have a first-team choice (Lamela), with two great rotation options (Townsend and Lennon). Andros is still young and Lamela and him can battle each other for starts. Lennon is a backup. 

I completely get where you're coming from, but a lot of your arguments are speculation and insight into how you feel the team would be best suited. Hell if we had Oil money, I'd be happy to upgrade our wingers. But we're a mid table club trying to develop talent rather than buy it all within a conservative financial strategy.

My thoughts are as follows:
1. Politics: lots of heat and light and likely wild moves in sentiment as we approach various elections â obviously 7 May in the UK and other significant ones such as the Greek and Spanish elections â the latter at the back end of this year. Overall mood and morale is likely to be more significant than actual meaningful policy initiatives with the exception of the eurozone area which could produce some shocks to the system.

2. Economies: Overall, reasonable growth rates again with the possible exception of the eurozone area which will still struggle with low rates of real growth. Energy users worldwide are clear beneficiaries of the transfer of wealth from energy producers. This will underpin real income growth in a world where wages will still not grow significantly.

3. Markets: Continued low inflation will permit the continuation of quantitative easing in its various forms. Market volatility will continue as fickle sentiment produces a broadly sideways trading range. Investor sentiment is largely one of a heightened state of nerves so the fact that we âmuddle throughâ another year is likely to push indices upwards.
We all need to remind ourselves about the unreliability of forecasts, entertaining as they may be!

Here is my risk register:
1. Electoral outcome â fragmented power â uncertainty prevailing
2. Terrorist activity â escalation â global destabilisation â cyber vulnerability
3. Eurozone â continued decline

Alex Wilmot-Sitwell, president (Europe), Bank of America Merrill Lynch

1. Elections and the likelihood of uncertain and unclear outcomes. Greece, UK and then Spain could all have very challenging results in terms of clear policy making and direction.

In the UK, I think that there is a good chance that the Conservatives lead the next government but then we enter into a protracted period of EU navel gazing and unhelpful distraction so not all good. However, it is also likely that this would be the case with a Labour-led government and their anti-business agenda and stance and their approach to higher taxes would be a big issue for growth and investment.

2. Low growth in the eurozone and QE. Welcome to Japan.

3. Lower oil prices â good overall for global growth so long as the price does not collapse from these levels.

4. The threat of terrorism. This is now higher than it has been for years. I see London returning to a level of threat and heightened security not seen since the IRA was targeting the UK in the 70s and early 80s. Social media and extremism make this harder to manage for the security forces.

Nigel Wilson, chief executive, Legal &amp; General

I hope 2015 is a terrific year for everyone â however I suspect it will be only if the business community leads from the front and invests to create economic growth and real wage growth â the CBI is starting to make some bolder statements, but it is not enough

I still think that Greece will muddle through even if Syriza form the next government in Greece and the chances of Grexit are low.

The biggest risk is we donât invest â we have become experts in identifying why we should not invest BUT Interest rates are at all time lows â As we have recently seen corporates can raise 5 year money at 0.5% and 10 year money at close to 1% â oil is below $50 â wage growth is around 2% and the UK economy is growing at 3% â I agree there is too much political and regulatory risk â we need to engage more to reduce it

In housing we need 4 million new homes suitable for older people, most cities need substantial regeneration and there is massive demand for private rented accommodation (a true cottage industry)

The world is awash with liquidity and with amazing technology that moves seamlessly across geographies â but corporate investment across most of Europe is too low and those corporates who want to invest are increasingly looking at the US and Asia
There is always election risk in Europe â there seems to be an election about every 40 days We cannot continue to use elections as an excuse not to invest â as Edward implies there is not that much difference between the main parties in the UK

We are instead allowing our politicians to invest in expensive energy â Hinkley, if the technology works will be Â£90 plus per MWH and off shore wind and other renewables at around Â£150 per MWH Furthermore instead of building interconnectivity through building public wifi they want to spend Â£50b to Â£70b on HS2 which may arrive in Manchester in 2035

Governments have to reform, Spain and Ireland were forced to do so â and as a consequence there are positive signs of growth- but we have to engage to drive that reform elsewhere â a big risk is we choose not to
You can take almost any sector in the UK and there are investment opportunities â In Energy we need low cost gas production, more storage, in house solar ie roof tiles, ground heat systems, Interconnectors with Norway etc
The list for pharma, healthcare, auto, technology, financial services, education is also long and exciting Even the mighty FT has growth opportunities as have other media businesses such as the BBC

The real risk is we convince ourselves not do anything about seizing the opportunities â it is clear that the US and China have both chosen a different route.
We can all write long essays on the risks associated with; Japan, Euro break up, China hard landing, the growth of rightwing politics etc

The above is problem identification â We are paid to solve these problems and deliver positive outcomes both at an individual level and as groups and communities

The UK should be a great place to invest â London is the best city in the World â many of the worldâs most successful businesses are located here as well as several of the worldâs leading universities
It is time to step up

James Bardrick, chief executive, Citigroup (UK)

Much has been said already particularly around election and economic slowdowns.
To add . . .
1. High likelihood that a combination of a very low interest rate environment and threatening stagnation / deflation in large mature markets for foreseeable future plus strong dollar impact on emerging markets will challenge many multinational corporate and financial businesses operating models and executives experience. Running and investing in these businesses will be particularly tough.

2. A continuing lack of trust in mainstream political parties, the financial services industry, âbig businessâ and global agencies and regulators combined with a greater focus on the real and perceived issues of increasing exclusion and inequality will make execution of âgoodâ reform, strategy and regulation considerably more difficult to execute.

3. Lots of reasons that barriers to and costs of international trade and economic development will increase and the progress and benefits of âgoodâ globalisation will be impeded.

However, all the more reason to commit to staying the course and making progress responsibly but assertively with a longer term strategy in the areas where players have demonstrated value and competitive advantage remain. Specifically, the UK financial services industry should continue to invest its time, ideas and talent and act as a strong financial services leader (in Europe and globally) and not âwait and seeâ â there will always be elections, uncertainties and precedented and unprecedented events and changes.

I think my biggest complaint is how rushed the end was, and it was completely unnecessary.  Especially considering that seasons 3 and 4 were functionally the same thing, just bump Morgana up to Morgause and slide Agravaine in for Morgana's role. If they had skipped a lot of Season 4 stuff, they could have given us more of the build up, or even let us see Arthur establishing peace and allowing magic before he died. 

And where did Morgana keep finding these armies?  I mean, the first few times they were enemies of Arthur, but after watching this woman get several armies killed, you would think it would be harder for her to amass one. Especially since he had been making more and more allies. And where were those allies during the final battle? We went to the trouble of meeting at least three kingdoms with whom Arthur had made a strong alliance, and didn't revisit any of them at the end.

A lot has been said already.

A messy Greek exit from the eurozone (it can scarcely be other) ranks high.

But a higher risk in my view is that QE fails to stimulate economic activity and defeat deflation in Japan and the eurozone. Results are already disappointing in Japan. There is a good chance we will have the same outcome in the eurozone once the ECB puts is hand to the QE plough. At that point, the economic policy armoury begins to look very threadbare. Ineffective monetary policy; very limited fiscal policy headroom; and weak political and societal support for structural reforms.

â¢ The biggest risks to financial markets are always the unexpected ones. In 2014, we had unexpected geopolitical risks including worsening tensions with Russia and rising nationalism, not just in the Middle East but across Europe and the UK. I donât think anyone would have expected the oil price to fall below $50 a barrel a year ago.
â¢ From an economic perspective, we see the main risk as deflation. Economic growth could surprise on the upside but if deflation were to gather momentum, this would be a much greater problem and would almost certainly be coupled with a further collapse in the oil price.

â¢ The known risks which the City is already starting to discount are the changes to the political landscape and the possibility of another hung parliament in the UK with the balance of power being held by one of the minority parties. Outside of the UK, an election in Greece later this month and the countryâs possible exit from the EU will cause continued uncertainty until resolved. (A possible UK exit is an issue for 2016/17 in my view.) All of these factors, along with further tensions with and within Russia, possibly driven by a further fall in the oil price or the rescheduling of debt, could cause volatility but not to the same extent as something unexpected.

â¢ Perhaps one low probability risk worth keeping an eye on is that should Greece have a very successful exit from the EU, some of the other countries facing continued low growth and austerity might also begin to think that an exit is a good idea. Greece leaving is one thing but Spain, Portugal or Italy would be different.

It is not possible or indeed wise to try to second guess what unexpected events lie ahead that could unsettle markets therefore, having a resilient and sustainable investment approach will be key in 2015 and beyond.

Seraina Maag, chief executive (Emea), AIG
Although much has been raised already, here are my thoughts:

1 The UK political scene. Previously a stable element in the equation: now a big source of uncertainty. The possibility of a weak government or coalition unable to carry policy and or/having to appease its allies and/or critics would mean either a 2nd election or bad policy. Most worrying risks â immigration policies making it harder to bring the talent we need to London (Cons) and an anti-business climate (Lab).

2 The oil boost canât offset lack of global growth and deflated eurozone. Populist politics across the region (including UK) drive protectionist policies, weaken legislatorsâ commitment to liberalisation, fuel hostility to international finance and global businesses. TTIP petering out would add to the toxic mix.

3 A major terrorist attack in London seems a matter of time and would make a gloomy picture worse.

Sir Win Bischoff, chairman, Financial Reporting Council

The biggest risks as I see them in order of priority are:
1. Inability to find the right transition from unnaturally low interest rates to those normal for the long term.
2. Inability of the UK electorate to deliver a decisive parliamentary outcome which allows uncertainty to be removed.
3. Inequality of economic benefits leading to further radicalisation of those perceiving themselves to be disadvantaged in economic, social political or religious terms.

But as a number of colleagues have pointed out there are lots of other risks any one of which could, if realised, cause great harm.
If there is one certainty it is that 2015 will be a year of great anxiety and worry!

Sir Philip Hampton, chairman, Royal Bank of Scotland
Lots of great points and reasonable consensus around elections and general political risk but Nigelâs challenge on attitudes to investment is really interesting.

Lots of very cheap money and lots of very well capitalised businesses, and generally good labour relations and flexibility. These were undreamt of conditions in most recent decades. We now have dramatically lower energy prices in prospect too. Deflation can be a risk to investment cases, but perhaps not as much as the ugly disturbance of out-control-inflation was a generation ago.
Even quite risky SMEs are borrowing at sub 4%, which is scarcely a figure in living memory. As Nigel says, big corporates with strong ratings, and governments, scarcely pay interest.

There are doubtless many explanations, including the new geo political uncertainty tempering animal spirits. But I also wonder whether businesses have adapted to a world of low inflation and nominal borrowing cost, especially when the low costs are a long term feature ie term debt is cheap, not todayâs overdraft.

The last 40 years or so of corporate planning in many businesses has been based in large measure on Modigliani-Miller, who lived in a very different world, and many corporates want to achieve real equity returns of, say, 10-15%, depending on their betas or whatever.

The fact that only a small proportion of US or European corporates have delivered returns at their cost of equity this century, and the fact that many equity investors seem eager to accept, or are at least reconciled to, lower returns should give food for thought for investment hurdles.


Simon Walker, director-general, Institute of Directors

Institute of Directors members are in good heart as we go into 2015. Theyâre expecting to have to pay employees rather more, and have factored this into their thinking. Theyâre ready for interest rates to start edging up â weâd prefer, but donât expect, to see that starting sooner rather than later. Theyâve been pretty gloomy about eurozone prospects for a while. If Grexit triggers a rationalisation of the euro, that may be no bad thing: it canât keep staggering on the way it has, and the demos will simply not allow fiscally disciplined hard-working northern Europeans to keep subsidising their lax and hidebound fellow eurozone members.

Of course the UK election poses risks. A particular concern of mine is that egregious behaviour by a few large businesses leads to generalised outrage about corporate greed and irresponsibility. That would play into the hands of the enemies of the free-market and could lead to a knee-jerk legislative and regulatory response. But if corporate Britain is sensible, my expectation is that reasonably business- friendly policies will prevail. It ought to be a pretty good year.

What none of us can predict are the true black swans of geopolitics, whether from Russia, the Middle East or North Korea. But in terms of known unknowns, the outlook is manageable.

My main risks for 2015 are mainly political in nature rather than financial or economic risks:
1) Elections in Greece, UK and Spain.

2) Ukraine and Russia risk

3) Terror incidents

4) Nationalism/Anti-islamisation movement in Germany/protectionism
On the economic side â deflation seems the obvious risk, but negative rates have not stopped people from fighting for TV sets over black Friday . . . so I am not sure that traditional economic theory applies.
I am rather more optimistic than consensus given, low input prices, low rates, quantitative easing, attractive FX rates for euro exporters, increased government spending on infrastructure projects and general fiscal stimulus, reviving consumer confidence, combined with a European market that seems to have been largely spurned by international capital flows. All this should make for some attractive investment opportunities in 2015.



Tidjane Thiam, chief executive, Prudential

I will not talk about the well-rehearsed risks related to the prolongation of QE or to the lack of structural reforms in key countries of the eurozone which have been very well covered by many others in this debate. I am actually not sure these are still risks as to a degree we all seem to agree they have already crystallised.
What I would like to focus on is the rise of political extremism in Europe, which in my mind is linked to a widespread perception that the free market system does not really operate in accordance with its stated principles of meritocracy, fairness, level playing field and transparency. Such perceptions are reinforced by the many stories reported in the media of financial markets being rigged, high youth unemployment and concerns around immigration, whether they are about security or reduced access to social services. One of the key questions of our time is clearly whether our economic model, as it functions currently, is politically and electorally viable any more.


This rise of the extremes may lead to a consolidation of power in the centre as traditional moderate politicians huddle together for warmth in national unity-type Governments after difficult elections. While this may appear a positive development in the short term as markets may be reassured by such outcomes, there is a risk that it just continues a sclerotic consensus that fails to address the deep underlying structural problems of Europe â negative demographics, unsustainable welfare provision, an increasingly risk-averse culture and a perception that the system is being gamed by the haves; further alienating the growing ranks of the have-nots.
There is a lot of discussion about a âcrisis of Capitalismâ. I actually donât believe that there is a crisis of Capitalism: Capitalism is alive and well, and being embraced with success in many parts of the world. I donât want to sound pious but what we need in Europe is to âwalk the talkâ a little more about some of the necessary conditions for capitalism to work well: meritocracy, level playing fields, openness, fairness and diversity. Europeans, and others, will accept unequal outcomes if they feel they are truly based on merit and a fair process.

So my hope for 2015 is that leaders in Europe will have the courage to:
(i) take on vested interests, (ii) move towards freer, more open markets rather than listen to calls for protectionism and paralysis and (iii) develop an appropriate narrative to get the public behind such policies.
Other parts of the world have long recognised this â most of them having paradoxically been inspired at the outset by European ideas (Adam Smith!).

Europe must remember what made it great, that it taught to the rest of the world if it doesnât want to be left behind, with negative consequences for everybody.

Daniel Godfrey, chief executive, The Investment Association

The risks for the City that are most worth worrying about are the ones over which we have some measure of control.
On that scorecard, the biggest risk is of our own inaction.

Inaction on change throughout the turntable of capital that flows from savers through agents and intermediaries into the economy and how it is allocated and stewarded (if thatâs a word!)

All players in the ecosystem need to work together to find concrete ways of developing Capitalism 2.0 which is inclusive, which reduces income (and wealth) inequality, which provides a living wage and which creates opportunity throughout society. Globally the risk of failure is nasty politics, economic failure, increased poverty, violence and, for the City, a loss of licence from society to operate.

The barrier is self-interest and short-termism. But at least we have the solutions in our own hands if we are willing to turn intellectual understanding of the need for change into real and visible actions that start the ball rolling in the right direction.

Jean-Pierre Mustier, former head UniCredit investment bank

This year we have a higher than usual concentration of important issues (domestic elections, decision about Europe, Ukrainian Russian conflict, social and religious tensions, change of monetary policy). Because of the uncertainty about the election results, the risk is high to have short term political over reactions to deal with such issues and gain populist support, without measuring any long term impact. This damaged the perception of France during its most recent election year and could do the same for the City and the UK. The other big risk is to find the right strategy in the moving battle fields facing us: how to handle a conflict with a nuclear power like Russia, sanctions or diplomacy? How to deal with the threat of extremism, restrict or not freedom of speech and privacy of information? How to handle a major cyber security breach in a much more sensitive industry than movie production like power, water or health? Any mistake could have dramatic consequences for the City and the UK.

Weâre spoiled for choice on the risk front this year, so I will highlight one which could easily crystallise in 2015 and describe another â more of an ongoing, insidious process than a single event â but which I believe will continue to deepen and which, if not ultimately resolved, will lead to some kind of profound future upheaval.
But first regarding the political situation in this country: maybe I have been living here too long (25 years) but have never lost faith in the uncanny ability of the electoral system for all its faults to muddle through and arrive at roughly the optimal outcome for the times; and, while there has clearly over the past few years been a genuine fragmentation of party allegiances, my expectation is that the general election will, after a lot of heat and light, result more or less in a continuation of the status quo; itâs mostly working and I believe enough voters intuitively understand weâre in the middle of a multi-term revitalisation project where the risks of tearing it up and starting over vastly outweigh the potential gains, especially in such an uncertain global/macro environment.
I worry only that the ongoing disproportionate focus on immigration â which is clearly a concern for a large % of the electorate â could jeopardise what I believe has been one of the vital ingredients of the UKâs economic dynamism, particularly compared to our European peers.

In terms of 2015 risks, the situation in Russia seems very fragile â the combination of high levels of maturing corporate debt (over $150 billion), low oil prices and heavily restricted access to capital on account of sanctions would appear to be a very challenging âtrifectaâ of circumstances; if one of these does not âgiveâ or change in some way during the year, it is difficult to see a favourable outcome for the economy there and hence its conduct on the geopolitical stage, especially having alienated such previous key supporters as Germany.
My longer term worry is the political implications of a sustained period of zero to low growth in a deflationary eurozone, and a bit like the slowly boiling frog, Europeâs lost decade is almost complete (70% and counting), all the while political leaders and central bankers claiming theyâll do whatever it takes to avoid it, and â due to an institutional preference for minimal/incremental solutions â saving the most potent and necessary ammunition until the battle is largely lost.

And no major country outside Europe â not the UK, US or Canada â will be immune from the consequences if this becomes an entrenched secular trend rather than just a long and deep cycle. The most worrying implications for me are: a steep erosion in popular support for the liberal economic order (which is ironic since itâs what many European countries need more of in order to generate better growth), a further rise of nationalistic and anti- globalisation populism, and a generalised loss of confidence in elites to deliver their end of the bargain (ie rising standard of living for the vast majority). How long it takes before we reach a tipping point is very hard to judge, and I donât believe weâre there in 2015, but itâs not a line we want to cross just in order to find out or because Europeâs political leaders lack the courage to make bold decisions without the imperative of a burning crisis.

The many risks to business as we enter 2015 have been listed. Most of these will be beyond our influence or control. No doubt we will be surprised by the ones that ultimately emerge as game-changers.
One issue that is firmly within our control is to continue to rehabilitate business as a recognised force for good as well as the only source of wealth. We risk much if we fail here, as a number of respondents have already noted. Our voice needs to be heard on the key issues affecting us all, such as EC membership and business regulation.
Unless we collectively act responsibly in our communities, embody our stated corporate values with authenticity, recognise the inequalities in society and play our part in addressing them and are not seen as greedy, we will be ignored. The cost of failure in this leadership would be huge.

Nigel Rudd, chairman elect, Meggitt

I am reminded of the only memorable sound bite from the last general election. âI agree with Nickâ. We all seem in agreement that capitalism is in some kind of crisis so I agree with all of you. The area I want to explore is income inequality.

The fact is that until recently those of us lucky enough to belong to the group of high income earners have had a licence to operate with the tacit approval of the rest of the population. They have by and large accepted us on the basis that a growing economy also gives them a chance to improve their own standard of living. Most people do not now believe this to be the case.

I am probably one of the few people who have actually read Thomas Pikettyâs book on the state of capitalism in the 21st century rather than a synopsis. Pretty hard going I can tell you. His answer to the accumulation of wealth by the few, is a global wealth tax. We all know this is totally impractical but one of his observations particularly caught my eye. He believes that modern capitalism has been hijacked by an elite management class.

In some ways I agree and make the following points:
1. It is now possible as a manager to become seriously rich without taking any personal risk. Even highly paid footballers risk breaking a leg. As executives we risk nothing. Very few people begrudge the Dysons, Bamfords, Dunstans or Bransons of this World accumulating wealth. They are capitalists in the true sense who took risks and reaped rewards. Should mere managers have the same rewards?

2. An elite group, including myself, have persuaded ourselves that we are worth huge sums for, in effect, managing other peopleâs capital either in the financial service sector or as managers of large corporations.

3. The power of organised labour at least in the Anglo Saxon world has diminished. This has had the consequence of increasing the share of wealth taken by capital and reduced the share taken by payroll. 

Paradoxically this has led to performance related pay for the elite to increase as they have driven productivity and reduced costs

I do not have an answer other than to be fearful of the political consequences. Nobody could sensibly argue that as managers we should increase payroll costs and reduce profits. I also donât believe for one moment that the elite will curb their desire to be paid more. My fear for 2015 is that the electorate will go for a government that will try to redress the balance. They will try to do this through the tax system. They will probably collect very little extra tax and do enormous damage to the economy. This happened in the 1970s and it took a couple of decades to fully recover. Picketty believes that the logical consequence of this is Revolution, probably starting in France as they are quite good at it! He believes that the âhave notsâ will despair of politicians. I hope not.
We should all start praying for serious growth and we might just get our licence back.

I can understand why people object to the expense of renewing Trident but I don't understand abandoning our nuclear capacity entirely. They deter conventional conflicts between the great powers which is something worth keeping. Seeing as we have the infrastructure to maintain them already it actually doesn't cost very much. Renewal is expensive, maintenance is not (roughly Â£280m).

Absolutely absurd and strategically illiterate. The armed forces don't have to be engaged in combat to protect Britain and it's interests; their mere existence acts as a deterrent to aggressors. 

There is no telling what will happen in the future and we need armed forces for a worse case scenario.

Have done so for 2 seasons so I've seen a bit of Rossiter and the other names here. Rossiter has a good range of passing, but I don't see the huge technical ability. 

For me, a technical player means one that is great at keeping the ball and able to play his way out of pressure. Technical = composed on the ball. Technicality for me is all about how a player handles tight situations. Having a good first touch under pressure, having a good first touch at full pace, being able to play out of trouble, being able to beat a man one on one...these things for me are what I consider technical. 

So under this definition, while Jordan Henderson is an extremely good passer of the ball, I don't consider him very technical. He shys away from pressure, which is smart, but there are advantages to having a technical player such as Joe Allen or Coutinho, who aren't afraid of bringing the ball up themselves by passing a defender in the midfield. 

Rossiter hasn't really show this trait when I've seen him. Sure, maybe thats because the coach has instructed him to play this way, but I think its because he's not that type of player. When you watch youth games, Chirivella shows much more confidence and technicality on the ball. Same with Wilson.

Fair point.... although I find their premise to be the opposite of progressive, wandering backwards if you will. I find myself saying:  

&gt; and then what?  

We pull out Europe, we cap immigration...... 

&gt; and then what?  

How would we deal with a tariff war against say India or China without being part of the EU? How do we retain our welfare pyramid without immigration?  I feel as though Farage is lost in a world of former empire where we'd actually be able to negotiate favourable terms in any sort of trade agreement. As the rest of the world grows and we eek out small % points of growth we slowly become less and less relevant at the bargaining table.   
The revelation of Farage's latest comment on the NHS just confirms my suspicions which is getting into bed with the US is the solution to all these problems which to me undermines his very desire of independence. We've already seen the level of control the US expects following our election of Labour following World War II (which relevantly enough resulted in Keynes himself having a stroke after trying to negotiate the loan agreement after the US pulled out the rug).  

&gt; I meant that you can't have Labour's preferred punitive tax regime and expect to generate significant growth which would in turn fund more spending.

I believe this one is debatable. Tax and growth are not necessarily as correlated as I believe your positing. Both governments (Tory and Labour) have demonstrated they can grow our economy and both governments have also tanked the economy at various stages demonstrating neither being the golden ticket to economic brilliance.  

&gt; To do their basic income thing you'd need very right wing economic measures to promote business. Eliminate the minimum wage, scrap workers rights etc etc. There's no way in hell the Greens would do that.

I'm not sure that's the only way, perhaps there are others. I would agree though with the general assertion that the Greens would likely be bad for business..... I think even just them getting voted in would tank the market overnight.  

However all this talk is made irrelevant because of First Past the Post. The system is setup so no new party can play so the best that we can hope for is that one of the ""big two"" will pick up a watered down version of these ideas at some point. Which means that I've totally got time for radical policy discussion in the hope that some of it might see the light of day sometime.

&gt;We still had the same strikers available against Arsenal, Swansea, Chelsea etc, but we played a completely different style than before December 15th? Why didn't we start attacking before that point in the season?

Because to play that style you need runs beyond the ball and I just explained why we didn't have that?

&gt;Look at our starting XI against Basel(H) and United(A), 1 week difference, complete overhaul of the team, tactics and formations, we couldn't have done that earlier?

Partly because 3-4-2-1 would have taken time on the training field before we could play it in a game (we actually switch to it for 15 minutes before Markovic gets sent off I think), partly because we exhausted other options before we got to a very experimental, very difficult system. It's easy to say in hindsight that he should have  got there earlier but imagine if you're in that position with your job on the line, would you start sending out 3 defenders and 7 midfielders like it's no big thing?

edit: saying that, this info wouldn't really help with looking at the likelihood of people who are eventually convicted of sexual offenses having previous accusations.. it just doesn't seem to be in the data.

Ok, [page 9 here](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/an-overview-of-sexual-offending-in-england-and-wales) states:

&gt;A large majority of offenders sentenced for sexual offences each year had not
previously been cautioned or convicted of a sexual offence â over 80 per cent in
each of the last seven years. Around four per cent of those convicted had five or
more previous cautions or convictions for a sexual offence and, in 2011, just under
80 per cent of those people received a custodial sentence. Of those convicted of
rape in 2011 who had five or more previous cautions or convictions for a sexual
offence, nearly all (97 per cent) received a custodial sentence.

He has made a decent number of starts in total yes I'll agree but in the competition that REALLY matters the fact remains he was not and is not (well, we have to wait until Lamela is fully fit to be sure) first choice so the manager cannot have that much faith in him. Maybe it's a case of square pegs / round holes with him being a left footer playing RW and he'll never be able to get the stats that make him look good but those stats really are just SO bad. So few assists, so few goals... It's just so frustrating to watch so many good chances/counters or good bits of possession/pressure absolutely wasted by him blasting the ball absolutely nowhere.

You're right I don't know what Poch has told him to do and we've not got money to burn in the sense we can bring in a star player mid season who may only be a rotation option but it doesn't stop me just being so fucking annoyed at Townsend. Maybe it would be better if Walker was always there bombing on past him to actually deliver a cross or he was always looking to play a ball in to Kane/Eriksen but he doesn't seem to want to do that enough, it's snap shot into row Z followed by a chorus of cheers from the opposing teams fans.

Paulinho is guilty of this as well. It's just absolutely up there as one of my absolute most hated things to see. I wouldn't even mind it if the Row Z ones were only occasional or at least on a decent ratio to the ones that are on target / goals but his ratio of shots to on goal or open play goals is SO shit it's just incredible.

In fact it's only when we judge the right to say something based on what is being said that any meaningful censorship can occur. While you could argue that social pressures that people unlikely to say things they might otherwise want to can be called censorship that's largely a colloquialism when talking about this in terms of formal rights. 

It is simply not something that free speech was, is or ever will be interested in because it is born out of the value judgments of the society and the values of the person who is thinking of speaking all of which is subjective. Not something you want mixed up when trying to work out someone's basic rights... which is why I dislike our laws in this regard and why I think it's absurd, for example, to strip ""human rights"" from terrorist. 

At best free speech acts to give the *possibility* that all views could enter into the debate by not allowing for unilateral expulsion of an idea from it. A voice can always be put to any view for any reason and that's all that matters.

General insurance companies make money by investing your premiums, not on charging you as much as possible. As long as there is healthy competition and rigorous regulation on the quality of care, their desire to make profit is basically irrelevant. Maybe it's not to you but do you feel the same way about the private businesses involved in providing you with food which you need every day in order to exist?

I'm not saying each mid should be able to play CAM and DM. what I'm saying is having the ability to play out of pressure is a necessary trait of top teams. its the mark of class. Busquets and Xavi are slow players who keep it simple and rarely join up the attack, but their ability to create an extra yard from their man helps them keep the ball or even slip past a man and bring play up.

I agree that I don't see us being that active in the transfer market this summer. Lacazette would be amazing, but I feel that if he continues at this rate, he will be snatched up by someone who can outbid or outpay us. We may have to go all in on him in the winter market before a bidding war starts in the summer.

chiravella is undoubtedly much better with the ball at his feet, has comparable passing ability and vision...what i think rossiter does have is the defensive work rate, the tackling, he has the scouse heart that we so desparately need. i think both could potentially make the first team, i really do. rossiter, though, is just something of a different breed and what he brings that is most important to a team is not measurable in stats necessarily. 

anyways as i always do, let me sum this up because i tend to ramble on my posts: chiravella=more technically gifted player with the ball, surely. rossiter=near equal passing ability, still comfortable on the ball, phsyically more gifted and a mental side to him (football iq if you will) that is beyond most of his peers, and why he is getting a look. Both can make it. both are solid prospects. both need to work very hard to make that impression. rossiter seems to have grabbed the attention of the boss and that's also important because now, at this juncture, he has scored a goal in his first (and only) lfc senior game and he needs to continue to raise his work levels in order to get on that team sheet more often. we also tend to forget he's 17. hendo wasn't a first team regular (albeit with sunderland) until he was 19, and was an lfc regular at 20. he wasn't considered a significant piece to the team until 22. rossiter, chiravella, ojo, wilson, all of these guys realistically have between 3-5 years before they will really have a chance to crack the senior team, so lets keep that in mind and help spur these guys along.

The one major factor in this is that prison funding is far less now than it was. Instead of having 4 or 5 officers on a landing of 40+, there are 2. It makes it impossible to provide the same level of care to vulnerable inmates, prevent drug use, prevent assaults, deal with violent inmates and maintain discipline.

Officers are now on 18-22k a year for a very difficult and stressful job and are leaving at a high rate and although it doesn't need much academical qualifications it takes a lot of ""jailcraft"" which can only be learned with experience, which is being lost as staff leave for better paid jobs as the majority feel very undervalued and overworked.

Honestly some of the jails and prisons are nearly at breaking point and people are going to die because of it!

It's a shit situation but will only get worse as properly funding jails is expensive and not a vote winner! Just think of the headlines ""more money spent on jails as class sizes increase and hospital waits go up""

Contrary to what some might think, most people working in jails aren't bullies and many pride themselves on doing a good job, and get on really well and having a good working relationship with the prisoners and want to see them looked after well!

The restrictions are removed following completion of the property sale, as you need the sale proceeds in order to pay the mortgage holder and the creditor. The removal of the mortgage holder's restriction isn't something you can do yourself, as the bank will want a guarantee that you won't run off with the sale proceeds. Only a solicitor can give them that sort of comfort. It would make sense for your solicitor, who will be dealing with the bank's restriction, to deal with the creditor's restriction at the same time.

Based on what your post says, it's entirely possible that you won't see a penny out of the property sale once the bank, the creditor and your solicitor have been paid. It depends on what's owed, how much the creditor will settle for and how much the property sells for.

I think you're right that we don't start loads of new players at any one time, but all of our new players have gotten significant minutes. Lovren was the leader in minutes played at one point, yet he hasn't made a start in a month or two, which shows how much the new guys have played. I am not sure how important it is that they play all at once, honestly. I can see the logic behind it, but someone like Lovren or Markovic are still playing in a new system with new players regardless of if they are also playing alongside 3 or 4 other new players.

True, of course. Upvoted, by the way, since someone seems to think downvote=disagree.

&gt; I'm a feminist in the traditional sense: men and women are equal, but women have some catching up to do.

Seems sensible and fair enough to me. I'd describe myself in the same way, and I'd say most people probably would as well. 

&gt; I think the casual sexualisation of both genders is a creeping problem

In what sense is it a problem. All men have penises and all women have boobs. What's to be ashamed about?

&gt; but Page 3, which happens to feature women, is the most extreme example of that. 

Really? Have you seen any porn? If you think page 3 is extreme you're in for a nasty shock. I also find it a little odd that someone who feels that casual sexualisation is a creeping problem would use an example of said problem (problem, being used loosely here) that's been around for longer than most people who visit reddit have been alive. (I'm not saying that's a reason to keep page 3 in itself, I'm just saying that if the problem is creeping, and page 3 hasn't changed in decades, how is page 3 responsible for any creep?)

&gt; The closest male equivalent is the Diet Coke guy, which is tamer and less ubiquitous - but still not something I feel comfortable with in terms of mass-market oversexualisation. 

Right, OK, fair enough. You're entitled not to feel comfortable about relatively tame images of men or women. I'm not really sure how that isn't prudish, since it effectively exemplifies the definition. 

Still, you're entitled not to buy any product that goes against your own particular standards. No one's forcing you to buy any of these things. 

But... this isn't simply about whether or not you can choose to take part, you seemingly support the core argument that misandrist feminists should have the right to demand what people do and don't see, even on publications, or in relation to products they themselves have no interest in buying. 

Can you explain how that isn't just a basic, obvious and open attempt to censor?

&gt; But I don't think adding lingerie removes the problem.

While I don't think there's even a problem to begin with, I do agree with you that putting a bra on the model isn't going to do a damn thing to curtail any of the fears you may have (which I generally don't find any reason to be fearful about in the first place.)

Still, I'm not seeing people with voices like your own getting much spotlight in the page 3 issue, it's by and large exclusively being championed by the loony side of feminism.

That's not really a problem, because a false accusation has to be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Which is why prosecutions for false accusations of rape are so rare: there were only 109 prosecutions during the last five years.

Some women's rights campaigners don't like these prosecutions because they fear that they put off rape victims from going to the police, but this doesn't affect policy and in my view is misguided.

I invested with Nutmeg just before Christmas. I have around Â£10k to invest which is just sitting in an ISA with my bank getting a rubbish interest rate. 

I wanted to try and make this money work a bit harder, but I'm not a financial expert. So Nutmeg appealed to me. Minimal work on my part, but seemingly a good steady return, much better than my bank.

Instead of sticking the whole Â£10k in, I thought I'd start off with just Â£1k to test the water. Since mid-December, and a Â£100 top-up at the beginning of Jan, my balance is now Â£1,151. An increase of 4.45% in just over a month.

Safe to say I'm ecstatic with that performance!

I'm not stupid, and know I must have been fairly lucky to achieve that return in such a short space of time. And I know it won't last. But hey, still a great start.

Everything I read though is very negative on Nutmeg, saying it's very expensive. Could anyone explain to me exactly why they think it's so expensive?

Like I say, I'm not a financial expert, but 1% fee a year doesn't seem like a lot to me. Â£10 on a Â£1,000 balance. Even with this fee, it's likely that the return will vastly outweigh what you'd get at a bank. And surely if you invested yourself instead, there'd be fees that you'd have to pay. I dabbled in buying and selling shares in the past and there was a Â£15 fee per transaction. ANd that was with Interactive Investor which was the cheapest place I could find to trade. Suddenly makes Nutmeg look cheap eh?

Overall, so far, I've had a great experience with Nutmeg. It's so simple and transparent. And there's nothing technical that I need to do.

At a guess I'd say that women tend to find implication and suggestion more powerful than explicit imagery - a tendency which we see reflected in how people sell stuff to us (because that is all this is).",null,0,null,1421947630,null,0,false,0,cnxchqb,null,t3_2t82yg,null,t1_cnxchqb,null,t1_cnx7ait,null,null,null,1424454849,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I would concede that this definitely a problem, however this doesn't prevent my premise as a philosophy or desire to be completely without merit, this is merely an implementation issue..  

However your premise that someone that earns Â£1Bn should earn Â£2Bn is absolute shit. They might be gouging, cropping, underpaying, overworking, bribing and giving themselves a giant's share of that wealth and giant shares are not good. A healthy economy has that money sloshing around and wandering everywhere. Someone who earns 2Bn per year can barely spend that much. Its not good, its a monopoly on wealth and should be broken up.

13 weeks at WHSmith, in 2005. Workfare has been alive and well for a long time. Practically all of the BS involved in the benefits system right now has been around longer than 5 years.

It's either been ramped up to level insane, or is just getting more coverage now. I *think* it's the former, but I can't be sure. The reason I think it's the former is because I have seen the media take a hard swerve to the right. It wouldn't be so widely reported in Tory-friendly media unless it was really becoming a problem. The way it looks is that Labour were at it at a low enough level that it went by unnoticed. We know they were at it, and there's no denying that. We were both there, both under the same boot. The panic I see around me among claimants wasn't there back then, though. People were confidently taking part in New Deal, grudgingly, and either getting nowhere or getting work (mostly getting nowhere, just like Work Programme now. Names change, stories stay the same). But there wasn't the ever-present dread that there might be a sanction around the corner. Sanctions existed, and they were used, but definitely not to the extent where every signing appointment felt like a game of roulette, as it is now.

Surely if it was like this 5+ years ago, even the left wing (but drifting right) media of the time would have picked up on it and reported on it. That's why I figure it's gotten a lot worse. People fear sanctions because they're told about them.

As fans, we don't get a whole lot of information as to what goes on in the locker room, so we have to make assumptions.  Since we don't hear about Ade being injured or having some other problem, we assume he's not there just because he's lazy and doesn't care about the team.

Mimicking another artist is good to learn, but when you create stuff you have to find your own way of doing it or you're just stealing someone else's artistic voice.

This image looks a lot like the stuff Alicexz does, down to the painting style and the background, and the image is either from the promotional photos or referenced from a screencap. Inherently, there's nothing wrong with that, but it also doesn't take much effort or much originality to take someone else's painting style and a screencap and put them together. Yes, time went into it, effort went into it, the individual is clearly good at digital painting, but it's not theirs. 

It's not just a matter of ""drawing off of someone else's style"" it's a matter of taking someone else's hard work, research and time and then claiming it as your own with a few tweaks. 

Cosplay is generally mimicking other people's work, and that's the point of it, even to the point where people get in arguments about how close or representative a costume is of its original design. Yes, there are people who do historical cosplay  / reinactment stuff, and there are steampunkers and modders, but ultimately cosplay started as people dressing up as their favorite characters. Your comparison is a little off base, honestly. 

You can't compare cosplay and art. One is a direct reflection of someone else's work, and art is striving to make your own work. Neither is better than the other and I think in some cases they can be symbiotic, but the creativity to make costumes look like their show replicas is a different creativity than it takes to paint the character in the first place.

""Football needs another Eric Cantona,"" says The Daily Telegraph's chief sports writer, Paul Hayward. ""One who turns his collar up, looks at the world like it's his ping-pong ball and says what he thinks.""

The closest we have to Cantona these days is probably Zlatan Ibrahimovic - the arrogance, the swagger and the uncanny ability to shock and surprise in equal measure - but he plays in France for PSG, and we don't really see much of him.


Do we have another Cantona slightly closer to home? A player we can't help but like and are not sure why? Step forward Diego Costa...

For starters, he's not afraid to alienate an entire nation. And not just any old nation. The most football-mad country on the planet who, last year, just happened to host the most important event in the football calendar. That's right, Costa, born in Brazil, elected to turn his back on the land of his birth and represent Spain. That takes balls. Especially as he then had to play for his adopted country at the World Cup in front of a few million unhappy Brazilians.

Second, he's old school. And in England we like that. So often South American forwards arrive in the Premier League and struggle to adapt - the weather, the food, the language, the physicality - they find something to moan about. But not Diego. He's big, he's bad and he's ugly and is about as ideally suited as you can get to a Premier League centre-forward.

Thirdly, he's not flash. At Chelsea he's one of their top earners, following his Â£32 million move from Atletico Madrid, but you won't see him spilling out of nightclubs, smoking on the job, tweeting something insanely stupid or arriving for training in the latest model of Ferrari.

Fourth, he loves football. Costa is in the same mould as Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez and Man City's Sergio Aguero. Like the Chilien and Argentine, he plays football like he's out in the park. He wants the ball. He may not have the speed of Sanchez or Aguero but he makes up for that with raw power. And he's not afraid not get stuck in. He just wants to play.

Fifth, he's not exactly an oil painting. That may sound harsh but there's something endearing about Costa's weathered, beaten-up look. If you had to go into battle with a footballer, Diego Costa is a man you'd want by your side. And he won't back down. He almost came to blows with Liverpool's Jordan Henderson in the Anfield tunnel the other night. Yeah, good luck with that one Jordan!

And finally, he's made it to the top the hard way. He may be on the big bucks now but Costa was no 16-year-old prodigy who had everything done for him and more money than his juvenile brain knew what to do with. No. In fact, up until 16 he was still playing street football in Brazil. Costa is walking, talking proof that good things come to those who wait.",null,0,null,1421949830,null,0,false,0,cnxdu72,null,t3_2tb5zn,null,t1_cnxdu72,null,t3_2tb5zn,null,null,null,1424454219,null,29,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,29,null

Pedestrian and cyclist: 0.5 * 75kg * 1.3m/s^2 (3mph) + 0.5 * (75+15)kg * 6.7m/s^2 (15mph) = 63 + 2020 = 2083J

(If the pedestrian were jogging: 0.5 * 75 * 2.5^2 = 234J)

Cyclist and Car: 0.5 * 90kg * 6.7m/s^2 (15mph) + 0.5 * 1500 * 13.4m/s^2 (30mph) = 2020 + 134670 = 136690J

136690/2083 = 66 times more energy, whereas a cyclist has roughly 10 times more kinetic energy than a jogger. So a cyclist is still going to cause more damage than a pedestrian, but the energy involved is a lot less than a road collision.

Also, last time I checked the road death statistics, cyclists killing pedestrians were anomalies in the single figures per year, hardly call that ""easily"".

&gt;[""Honey bees are widely recognized as important beneficial insects. In most countries, regulators assessing potential risks and benefits from GM plants list the honey bee among the 'non-target' species that need to be considered before these plants are released.

This article summarizes research on bee health and GM. There is now a considerable body of knowledge on this topic and some well-established techniques for assessing risks to bees before new plants are released.""](http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15890956)

null,false,epeeist,null,null,null,"&gt; In all honesty, page 3 is about the least offensive thing about the Sun newspaper.

Definitely agreed on that.

I didn't say that a topless woman is an extreme sexual image. I said it was *at the extreme end* of the casual sexualisation of the mass media, and it has been since it was introduced. (i.e. it hasn't suddenly become a problem - it's always been really jarring.) Of course there are far more explicit things to look at than a topless woman, but we don't sell anything even close to explicit for 40p in every newsagent and supermarket in the country. If Page 3 breaks no social norms, why doesn't every paper have it?

The increasing sexualisation I'm talking about is mainly in other media - films, TV shows, music videos. Think about the way women (particularly) are photographed in blockbusters; the stand-out example is Megan Fox in Transformers movies. I suppose it bothers me because it feeds into my insecurities about how women are still viewed as decoration, not protagonists. I do a professional job and have experienced first-hand the (quite scary) views some men have about women. Clearly the vast, vast majority of men are normal, emotionally intelligent people, not thugs or rapists or supremacists. But there is a backwards minority that see women as genuine inferiors, and at worst as sexual commodities. I don't like to see that view reinforced in the mass media, and I feel Page 3 does that.

I mean, I'm not going to pretend the tabloids serve any purpose other than to divert, however briefly. Sensationalised news items, celebrity gossip, naked woman, cartoons, sport. For me, that naked woman sticks out like a sore thumb. I'm not calling for censorship, I'm not trying to ban nudie pics, I'm not saying our culture should be neutered and asexual. But we don't live in a sensible world where they're just boobs, or it's just an admiration of the female form.

This is where I was at my recent Christmas job with Royal Mail.

Sorting through 2 and a half million parcels a week for 6 weeks felt like a fucking holiday. The optimism I built up while doing that back-breaking, mind-numbingly dull work made me realise just how broken I was from life on JSA. I want to do another 6 weeks already and I've only been back on JSA since new year's eve.

The downside is the fact that the only thing I've actually got out of those weeks of work was some rent arrears. Working and earning = no housing benefit. Couple that with never having to pay rent before, so having no clue how to go about it, or whether I even needed to pay the full amount. By the time I'd settled into the routine of working by night and sleeping by day, and could find the time to set up a potential HB claim, I was about to finish work, so I didn't bother and just waited til I was back on JSA.

Basically, it was a nice holiday that screwed me a bit, and left me hardly any better off (despite being paid well over minimum wage and numerically being quite a lot better off. About Â£6,000p/a vs about Â£16,000p/a).

It's made me realise something pretty important about myself too. I shouldn't play chicken with social issues. Previous jobs I've had have mostly been retail, and mostly left me a broken shell after a matter of days. I figured I just hated doing work that didn't challenge me, mentally. I had zero issues sorting mail. As far as one can possibly love such work, I loved it. The big difference... no customers. No having to face strangers asking stupid questions all the time. This, I think, is the deciding factor in previous retail work leaving me actually suicidal. I don't deal well with other people in general (thanks to being autistic), but if I can get used to the other people, I can get more comfortable around them, and they become less of an issue. This has changed everything in terms of future work for me. Where I was looking for security work before, but might have hesitantly considered going back to retail work, I can say now I've definitely scrubbed retail work off my list of possibles. After all, if it's been a disaster 100% of the time before, and something different wasn't remotely a problem, then it's clear the cause of the disaster is the choice of industry.",null,0,null,1421951156,null,0,false,0,cnxeor9,null,t3_2t5npr,null,t1_cnxeor9,null,t1_cnx8cke,null,null,null,1424453753,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt;âSanctioningâ is a particularly harsh and brutal way of treating unemployed people.   They have all their benefit removed even for the most trivial infringements, e.g. being 5 minutes late for a job interview or for a work programme session.   Their benefit (Â£71 a week JSA) is removed for 4 weeks for the first infringement, for 3 months for the second, and (almost unbelievably) for 3 years for the third.   This quickly reduces the victims of this abhorrent policy to destitution and leaves them with no alternative but to beg for board and lodging from family or friends.   There is no appeal against these decisions which could well be regarded as a breach of the common law by deliberately reducing a person to penury by administrative edict against which there is no redress.   There are now nearly a million people who have been subject to this inhumane practice of sanctioning.   That is awful enough, but it has now become clear there is another motive on the part of government driving this policy.

&gt;There has been great puzzlement in economic circles at the plunging drop in the unemployment figures over recent months from 7.8% to 7.1% which was far bigger than might be expected from the state of the economy and the very low level of labour productivity.   It even caused consternation in the Bank of England where the governor Mark Carney was forced to revise his âforward guidanceâ which had been based on raising interest rates when the unemployment level fell to 7%.   It now seems this enigma can be explained.   The government has adopted the utterly dishonest practice of excluding from the claimant count all those persons who have been sanctioned.   Thus the abrupt fall in the claimant count is explained by the scam of regarding all sanctioned persons as no longer seeking work, though they clearly are.

null,false,meeeow,null,null,null,"Just because they are both Western it does not mean they are comparable. Holland and the US are both western cultures but Jock Sturges makes a fantastic break down of how their approach to sex and the body are so different in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4BETqLDzJY). Page 3 girls don't exist in a vacuum, you have to consider why they are there, who wants them there, how as a culture we relate to sexuality and nudity, how we communicate that. There's a whole tangle of issues that merges in this case. For example, I lived in Amsterdam and both male and female nudity were present in a non-sexualised way, they were common. We don't do that, we are not really ok with for example full frontal, or showing sexual parts of men, depictions of women's breasts in a non-sexual way is very rare (Even in the context of breast-feeding people take issue with breasts) so you can't just say 'they're both western cultures so whatever', no you need to look deeper than that. 

So to answer you're next question, why is it a problem when children see them, it's a problem because it normalises the sexualisation of women, it communicates that just having them there as decoration it's ok. It tells both boys and girls that this is what a woman should look like, these are really powerful messages that children internalize. Now, is not The Sun who is going to make or break them, but do you remember what I said about Page 3 girls not existing in a vacuum? When we have a culture where this kind of sexualisation and objectification are common, the message becomes louder and more powerful. Even if you take away children from the equation completely, the fact remains that as a country we are really puritanical when it comes to things like nakedness, sex and swear words. Its the reason why you don't see a lot of content before the watershed, it's the reason why lads mags with half naked women are on the top shelves. So why is this publication different? Why is not being placed with other publications that contain soft-core pornography? Why does it deserve special treatment?

I agree with you, I think the UK really needs to chill the fuck out when it comes to sex, but that's not why the Page 3 girl is there and it's not like the you can divorce it from the broader cultural context it exists in. 

As for objectification of men, it's bad too of course, it's simply not the topic at hand. And by the way I said nothing about banning anything.

Make sure that the bike satisfies any additional (third party) warranties  that the bikes comes with to entice you to buy it. I've been sold a bike that came with a warranty I could not claim on because it didn't meet the third party's criteria.

That makes sense. Brittan was an intelligent and hardworking man who was more than willing to do Thatcher's dirty work when called upon, and to carry the can when things didn't work out as planned. My inclination is to read him as having been a loyal functionary rather than as a pedophile, but I wouldn't rule anything out. Another thing to keep in mind is that the Thatcher cabinet was the first Tory cabinet to have a significant number of Jewish ministers, and that many of the traditionalist Tories were sneeringly antisemitic. I suspect this had some bearing on Brittan being such an unprincipled keener: he knew there were hostile remarks being made behind his back and that his support could suddenly vanish. And he was a shy, awkward man who lacked the self-confidence of someone like Nigel Lawson or Keith Joseph.

Your 'holy trinity' of anti ageing is arguably a retinoid, vitamin C and niacinamide. All antioxidant actives have some anti ageing benefit, but the polyphenols are probably the next best after the trinity. So yes retinol has the potential to be a multitasker.

Most of PC's retinol products are relatively low percentage wise, they are decent for beginners but it is worth upgrading at some point. Not tried it yet myself but [Ishtar Skinlights] (http://www.ishtarskinlights.com/skin-treatments/retinol) looks great value for money. I would however check with the company whether their sunflower oil is the regular high linoleic acid type (beneficial for skin barrier) or the high oleic acid type (detrimental to skin barrier and the irritant in SD).

I haven't seen the PC e-mail so it's difficult to comment on what was said, what the reasoning and scientific basis is. Seems odd given PC are big on moisturiser-sunscreen combo products tho.

Dry/ dehydrated skin = a struggling skin barrier and research suggests it exfoliates less well than hydrated skin. I don't see the logic in allowing skin to become dehydrated before treating it: to me much skincare is preventative: we aim to prevent dryness/ ageing/ acne, etc.

Also not all the effects of dryness/ dehydration can be seen or felt, researchers test for increases or decreases in TEWL (trans epidermal water loss) rather than simply relying on the test subjects to say if their skin feel dry, tight or flaky. Just because you do not have 'symptoms' (see or feel) doesn't mean there are no 'signs' (can be found on tests or physical examination) of a disorder or warning signs of the same.

Having said that some serums are 'rich' enough to double as moisturiser, and certain sunscreens can double as moisturiser providing the right amount is applied.

But a toner ... ? That Skin Recovery toner has butylene glycol (penetration enhancer and potential irritant), and cycopentasiloxane (volatile silicone so evaporates off) right at the top of the ingredients. I don't believe there is enough niacinamide or ascorbyl palmitate to do anything without the support of serums or treatment moisturisers.",null,0,null,1421954284,null,0,1421954696,0,cnxgnev,null,t3_2t2fil,null,t1_cnxgnev,null,t1_cnx5apv,null,null,null,1424452838,null,3,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,3,null

&gt; An organisation that a few years ago was trying to get voters to care about its plan for an NHS for pets.

Nope. Utter rubbish. The article links to an article in the telegraph which in turn doesn't in any way back that up. It's no on their policy website, I can't find any source for it. Good start.

&gt; Caroline Lucas â who was arrested at a fracking protest a couple of years back

The article mentions that as if it's a bad thing.

&gt; Under a Green government, the Monarchy would be scrapped

[The policy states that the Monarchy would no longer be a constitutional part of the government of the UK, not that it would be scrapped.](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/pa.html)

&gt;and everyone â from the unemployed to Alan Sugar â would be given Â£71-a-week, ""citizen's income"". The idea is that this would replace other benefits, nobody would be without a safety net and people could all work a little less if they wanted to. It's a move the Telegraph estimates would cost the UK economy around Â£250 billion a year â ten times the defence budget.

Rather then comparing it to the Defence Budget, why don't we compare it to, oh, I don't know, the current Welfare Budget that it would be replacing, [which is currently around Â£215 billion](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/9/1357739565544/Public-spending-on-Benefi-001.jpg).

&gt; Anti-rave laws would be scrapped

... and they'd be regulated to ensure that police are aware of where they are taking part:

&gt;DU105 Raves / pay-parties / free-festivals and the like have proved an enduring setting in which various drugs are consumed by many tens of thousands of young people across the country. Unlicensed and unregulated events, kept underground by prohibition, are held regularly in overcrowded venues or inappropriate sites that fail to meet health and fire regulations, at which ventilation and provision for refreshments are inadequate and to which the emergency services would be unable to gain access if needed. The popularity of these events and their proliferation in spite of attempts to suppress them makes the adoption of a more liberal approach coupled with a system of regulation a matter of highest urgency.

That suddenly seems a little more sensible now we have it in context.

&gt; drug laws would be significantly liberalised

As recommended by the [Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs]( http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(10\)61462-6/fulltext) and repeatedly ignored by current governments.

&gt; The sex trade would look more like Amsterdam

A reform long since overdue.

&gt; but drinking would look more like Scandinavia â really fucking expensive, with taxes for booze and fags increased

Because that totally hasn't gone up under every single government.

&gt; An attempt to bring the council into line with equal pay legislation in 2013 saw bin collectors facing a Â£4,000 pay cut, which led to a week of strike action.

So they implemented legislation voted through by central government and it's their fault?

&gt; More recently, an attempt to increase council tax by 6 percent was voted down by Green councillors, despite their party coming up with the proposal.

I can't work out if this is praise or scorn.

&gt; Meanwhile, Councillor Ben Duncan, who had previously called for Brighton to introduce cannabis cafes to boost the tourism trade, described members of the armed forces as ""hired killers"", ensuring he would be forever viewed as a hate figure in the right-wing press.

I mean... is he wrong? Are they not paid to kill?

&gt;  ""It's a mess, figuratively and literally,"" is how Cllr Warren Morgan, leader of the Labour opposition on the council, characterises four years of Green rule.

Blimey, who'd have thought that the council opposition would have only disparaging things to say? He goes on to say:

&gt; ""I go into meetings with the council leader, and he says he can't deliver his group because the party is not whipped.""

A resounding endorsement for the Greens if ever I heard on.

Well, that's probably the choice that's going to have to be made.

Unfortunately people who are young today have been stitched right up by the preceding generation or two, and it's going to take big sacrifices if you want to rebuild the welfare state. 

Frankly, I still see a largely negative perception of socialist policies here, so I'm pretty much expecting to pay for my own healthcare.

Secondly use a skin barrier repairing moisturiser and/ or sunscreen each morning. Initially you could try your night product in the day (there isn't anything night specific in there just some ceramides and phytosphingosine which are beneficial any time). Alternatives include CeraVe PM lotion (4% niacinamide for acne and the barrier) or one of the Eucerin face creams (5% urea which is hydrating and gently exfoliating).

The NIP+FAB pads (&lt;3% glycolic acid) are pretty gentle if used in moderation - can be alternate days or every day on the less sensitive areas and every other day on the more sensitive areas for example. This also means the tub lasts WAY longer! Listen to your skin each day and learn what it needs. If it is struggling think about what you did 'wrong' the previous couple of days. Maybe you slacked on the moisturising, maybe you exfoliated even tho your face felt stripped and a little tight or more tingly/ sensitive than normal.

Lastly take an honest look at your diet and lifestyle choices, ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle.

Instead it's ruminant thoughts to the detriment of all other activity. Coupled with my concentration span, this means I can literally spend 18 hours doing nothing but coming up with strategies for computer games)

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Recurrent Depressive Disorder

and finally,

Social Phobia

It's a cocktail of crap that doesn't remotely affect my ability to do things, but severely hampers my likelihood of doing anything but vegetate inside my own head without some form of outside intervention, which I don't have. Once upon a time I had an occupational therapist, but I lost her to the NHS reforms. She had decided I'd made a lot of progress and discharged me instead of putting me through getting used to another stranger (partly an act of mercy, partly sentencing me to fall back into being pretty useless). I can work. I not only recognise this, but refuse to go on ESA for two reasons. 1) I'm a job seeker, therefore Jobseekers Allowance and 2) if I had an assessment, they'd take one look at me and say I'm fine, because instead of burbling some loosely-defined string of grunts, I might animatedly offer them a 4 hour introductory course on rocket science once they coax me out from under the table.

In short, I'm not unfit for work, I'm just not a very likely prospect for most employers, and thus difficult to employ. There's also a very limited range of industries where I wouldn't be reduced to a gibbering wreck and can perform well (needs to be with a smallish team who don't mind working with an oddball who needs to be reminded of everything, otherwise will tangent off into something esoteric that involves too many big words but vaguely involves either games, TV shows or comics. Needs as little public facing stuff as possible but is polite as all hell. Great at customer service, terrible at *surviving* customer service stuff.

This all leads me to security work, especially CCTV. If there's one thing I can definitely do, it's watch and study people from a distance. Not having to walk up to them with a big fake smile and offer to help them. Unsociable hours are great for an unsociable man who does everything at night to avoid crowds. Only needing to be in contact with my managers, my fellow CCTV operators and sometimes the police. I don't think the police will be put off too much by me not really sounding too friendly (my language is nice and friendly and polite, but my actual voice doesn't convey anything, I'm told), they'd just get on with working with me. This is why I now have SIA licenses. Just looking for an opening that doesn't require experience.

I have never been sanctioned (yet), but I fully understand how close I am to one at any given moment. When my signing days approach, I spend the day before and the same day in an agonising loop of uncertainty. I know very well that I 'appear' fully functional, not remotely disabled, and therefore fully capable of meeting each and every requirement. I look at my world around me, and the chaos I am enveloped in, and I know how only 30 minutes too long pondering the intricacies of warp drive at night may make me miss my alarm in the morning and be late to signing on. I know how too much time watching Firefly may leave me with too little time spent jobsearching.... In terms of sanctions, I live on a knife's edge. Mistakes that are far too common for me need only happen at the wrong moment, and I lose my livelihood.

Now have a look at that list again. Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Knowing you might lose your only income in a minor moment of bad judgement and knowing you are very good at making those bad judgements doesn't really play well with being prone to severe anxiety. I sign on on Mondays. How would you feel, in my position, on the bus to the jobcentre on a Monday morning? I feel that way every fortnight, from Sunday to Wednesday.

The last job I had was in the run up to Christmas, sorting mail. That was a holiday for me. Finally being free from the jobcentre felt great. It's ironic, really. Most people would think that working a 21:00 to 05:00 is the chore and lazing about just signing paperwork for money is the life of luxury. I can only speak for myself when I say this is not so.

I know that I need much more intensive support into work (and with life management) than I currently get. I have major problems asking for it, though. I do not know specifically what sort of support I need. Asking for a cleaner to visit me once a week sounds cheeky as hell to me, because I'm physically capable of doing my own cleaning. Asking for help with forms and stuff.... I can read heavy tomes about the omega point theory and understand highly complex concepts of existential nature. A mere application form is no challenge. The best description I can provide of what support I need is 'someone to give me a kick up the arse every two minutes, who knows how to encourage results without coming off as condescending or disappointed, because I rebel against condescending and I already disappoint myself enough without having someone else to feel guilty about disappointing'. As far as I know, no sort of job title fits that role. I get that it's down to me to work it out for myself, something I've had mixed results with, but the current state of affairs makes that considerably more difficult to do alone than it would be if I wasn't legitimately afraid of having my entire life situation brutally violated at a moment's notice.",null,0,null,1421956100,null,0,1421956282,0,cnxhscp,null,t3_2t5npr,null,t1_cnxhscp,null,t1_cnvxl5z,null,null,null,1424452307,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,Eureka_Street,null,null,null,"&gt; I didn't say that a topless woman is an extreme sexual image. I said it was at the extreme end of the casual sexualisation of the mass media, and it has been since it was introduced. (i.e. it hasn't suddenly become a problem - it's always been really jarring.)

Fair enough. I get that distinction. 

&gt;  Of course there are far more explicit things to look at than a topless woman, but we don't sell anything even close to explicit for 40p in every newsagent and supermarket in the country. If Page 3 breaks no social norms, why doesn't every paper have it?

Surely the fact it's been around for ages suggests its to some extent an element of what makes up a social norm? Not that I think that's a reason in itself to keep it, it's not. But still, several of the red tops have naked women in them; Although I get the symbolism of ""bringing down page 3.""

Still, to me it feels like a hollow victory (especially in light of what happened today, with The Sun trolling everyone.) 

&gt; The increasing sexualisation I'm talking about is mainly in other media - films, TV shows, music videos. Think about the way women (particularly) are photographed in blockbusters; the stand-out example is Megan Fox in Transformers movies. 

I do love films. Some films portray women as one-dimensional sex objects and some films don't. Advertising constantly rams imagery down your face, it's totally normal to get sick of elements in it. The overall media barrage can be overwhelming and I'm no fan of Rupert Murdoch, the sun or british tabloids in general. It's just muck.

The thing about films and media and tabloids and page 3 is that you don't have to watch or read them. Other people exist and some of those people like watching films where women are sex objects and I don't really see why people think they have a right to control what other people can or can't do. Obviously everything has limits and no one's advocating chaotic anarchy, but if you're going to live in a free society, chaotic anarchy in terms of what is or isn't publicised is a by product. 

&gt; Clearly the vast, vast majority of men are normal, emotionally intelligent people, not thugs or rapists or supremacists. But there is a backwards minority that see women as genuine inferiors, and at worst as sexual commodities. I don't like to see that view reinforced in the mass media, and I feel Page 3 does that.

Yeah, a lot of men can be dicks. Just like a lot of women can be dicks too, it's not a one way street. I don't see how page 3 cheapens women anyway - people have a stick up their bum about the appreciation of beauty in this country, choosing to brand every element of sex perverted, instead of normal like a lot of other countries do. It's simple puritanism, but instead of religion it's the religion of ""protect me from being offended always by everything.""

We all just have to get over how offended we get. I do it too.

&gt; They also do have a number of policies which mention women specifically...

Those are the two you mentioned there. However, they also have many policies regarding reform of the justice system, and sentencing in particular:

&gt; CJ340 Wholly unacceptable levels of men, women and children are currently imprisoned at great cost to their future rehabilitation, as well as to their families, the taxpayer and society in general. The Green Party is therefore committed to significantly reducing the prison population. To that end, a range of measures will be used, including changes to sentencing policy and practice. Courts will have a duty to reduce use of custodial sentencing in favour of community sentencing. (See also 'Immediate Prison Reforms' section, below.)

&gt; CJ330 The community's first response to a crime is to offer support and services to victims.

&gt; CJ341 New principles will be introduced giving Courts the duty to sentence with main objects of firstly, ensuring reparation to the victim or the community and secondly, persuading and enabling the offender to become a law-abiding member of the community.

&gt; CJ331 All accused who admit the offence or are convicted would immediately be provided with an opportunity to offer reparation to the victim(s). Local victim/offender mediation services could convey such offers to victims, in liaison with victim support, and negotiate between the two parties, offering the chance of a direct meeting - in the immediate future or later on - if the victim would like to have the opportunity.

&gt; CJ334 Reparation might take various forms directly to the victim, if the latter wanted it, or in service or payment to the community; or it might include taking part in a programme that would encourage the offender to avoid offending again, such as vocational training, counselling, therapy, problem solving and other ways of overcoming disadvantage; or it might be a combination of these different forms of reparation. Where a crime has a transphobic, homophobic, or racist elements or targets people due to a disability or faith, the offender should be given specific training to encourage them to review their attitudes.

&gt; CJ335 For less serious crimes which have little effect except on those personally involved, the Prosecution Service (CPS) would use its discretion not to prosecute if adequate compensation had been agreed or to suspend prosecution conditionally on the offenders carrying out agreed reparation.

&gt; CJ336 For serious offences where the offender is regarded as a danger to society, or others are affected (for example because they fear they may become the next victims), a personal settlement is not enough. Serious offences require a public denunciation, and these cases would be brought to Court by the prosecution.

&gt; CJ342 Reparation of whatever nature agreed or ordered would in the first place seek to reflect the actual financial and other losses and the pain, injury and inconvenience suffered by the victim. Then the offender's ability to pay and perform the reparation would also be taken into account.

&gt; CJ343 Reparation successfully completed before sentencing by the court in a serious case will be taken into account in determining the sentence. Mediation between victim and offender, however, will be a voluntary process affecting only the victim and offender as individuals.

&gt; CJ344 Current non-custodial sentences such as Community Service and Probation would continue to be used, but the use of fines would be replaced by measures which make reparation for the harm/ inconvenience caused. In the short term emphasis would be placed on increasing the reparative element in sentencing and reducing the use of detention.

As I said before, they specifically mention women in two of the policies (something which I think isn't even required given the other policies), however it is clear from their stated policies that they are committed to a massive reduction in the prison population and a reform of sentencing laws that will benefit everyone.

Depends on lots of factors. A large property with a single tenant can be risky as if they abscond there's no one to pay rent (unless they have a good guarantor). A couple can split up (at which point liability for rent can become contended unless there is an iron-clad tenancy agreement) or quickly outgrow a small property.

A shared household can be risky if the tenancy is under one person's name and the others are expected to pay that person, however in that case the landlord wouldn't be liable for the council tax bill.

The people that are cheating just know how to work the ropes.

Maybe if there was a living wage people would be more compelled to actually work rather than claim benefits. I worked a crappy high labour job and after paying transport to and from work I was left with Â£40 a week to pay my bills and buy myself food. If it wasn't for housing benefits I would have had to go back on the dole to survive. It's impossible to get up every morning and go to a crappy job and end up with less money than you would get on the dole. I stuck at it because I guess i was scared of the judgement of benefits and that why i personally didn't go back on them.

The whole system is flawed. When I was on jobseekers fresh out of school I went to the job centre to try and get work or additional training to help me further my education and try to become a 'valuable' member of society they turned me away. 

I was not out of school long enough to qualify for education. I also had to be on the dole for 6 months before I could take an apprenticeship. I also needed somewhere to live rather than touring around sofas, scrounging of my friends.

Do you know what fixes all those problems. Have a child or fake illness. 

If more support was given, more effort was put into getting people back into school and into Training where you get paid more than Â£4 and hour and making  it so working was possible. Not more appealing, but actually possible. 

Look at childcare costs, transport costs, public transport is a rip of and owning a car is expensive (never mind the costs of learning to drive, which is what one advisor reccomened after I complained I couldn't get adequate transport to half of the interviews they sent me, walk 15 miles was another gem she said)  

The fact when you get a job you need to make sure your working within the limits to receive top up benefits if not you're going to end up even worse of as well.

It's a load of bull. Steaming, smell bull. Fraud is the least of our worries. When it comes right down to the core problem it's not even relevant It's the government oppressing the poor, making the working class poorer and making the poorest destitute and turning us all against each other. 

Considering our local council decided to cut the bus times, close our local hospital down, take away daily meal delivers for our elderly and replace it with fortnightly frozen meal deliveries AND charge for parking and premium numbers to the local clinic all to save money. Then to turn around and spend 10 million fixing up our town square for some stupid cycling race. They are the real thieves.

I now this rant probably didn't make a whole load of sense and went of on a tangent haha I'm not the best at articulating my thoughts.

Edit, I also forgot to add, some people with health conditions and mental health problems COULD work, but the support needed to make that happen is almost non existent and the little there is is completely inadequate.",null,0,null,1421958309,null,0,1421958754,0,cnxj6eu,null,t3_2t5npr,null,t1_cnxj6eu,null,t1_cnxgt5n,null,null,null,1424451658,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

And you might be on to something because yes, Conservative voters [do think](http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/graph/?id=888#.VMFbtUfF-So) that Labour is further left than Labour supporters, according to the British Election Study's data the blog post drew from. 

Just over a quarter of those who intend to vote Tory at the next elections place Labour at a 0 on the 0-10 left-right scale, and 59% of prospective Tory voters place Labour at either 0, 1 or 2. Those who intend to vote UKIP are of much the same mind. 28% of them place Labour at the very furthest left point on the scale (0) and 52% of them place Labour at 0-2.

Those who intend to vote Labour, on the other hand, regard their party quite differently. Just 11% of them place Labour at the far-left end of the scale, and no more than 33.5% of them place the Labour Party at either 0, 1 or 2. 

The rather overblown views of Tory and UKIP supporters of how far left Labour stands would explain much of why Labour comes out overall at a 3.0 out of 10 among English respondents, considering how many Tory and UKIP voters there are among them. 

Does this mean that the reason Labour is viewed as significantly more left-wing in England can be explained purely by the fact that Tory and UKIP voters see them as pretty far off to the left and there are more of those in England than in Scotland? Or are there kind-by-kind differences in how Labour is perceived north and south of the border too? I.e. do Scottish Tory voters see Labour as less left-wing than their English counterparts do; do Scottish Labour voters see their own party as less left-wing than their English counterparts do; etc?

null,false,Manny-B,lfc99,,null,"For those that can't access the article or don't want to read it here's a quick summary of whether the loanees are deemed to have a future at the club...  
  
* **Andre Wisdom** - Maybe. Johnson's contract is expiring and Manquillo is currently only on loan so there could be a space in the squad. Could depend on whether Rodgers thinks he can play as a RWB or as a CB (his best position imo).
  
* **Joao Carlos Teixeira** - Possibly. He is benefiting from the increased responsibilty of playing regularly and seems to be developing well. Would appear to be honing the necessary talents required to play in attacking midfield at Anfield but has plenty of competition in that position.
  
* **Divock Origi** - No doubt that he is a big part of the Reds' future. We spent Â£10m on Origi and even considered paying an extra few million to bring him to Anfield early.
  
* **Luis Alberto** - Probably not. There is talent (shown by his assist for Suarez's goal against Spurs) but it looks like the Premier League is not the place for him to show it. He would have limited opportunities with the options Liverpool have.
  
* **Iago Aspas** - No. Both the club and the player will likely want to move on.
  
* **Sebastian Coates** - Unlikely. He hasn't been given much time playing in the Premier League but hasn't really impressed in the limited time he's had.
  
* **Tiago Ilori** - Hard to say. Though he is quick, good on the ball and did well on loan to Granada last season, there is a long line of central defenders ahead of him.
  
* **Jack Dunn** - Aged 20, it will be difficult to break through in a side with so many attacking options â but he's giving food for thought at Cheltenham, where he will remain for the rest of January.  
  
* **Lloyd Jones** - Too early to say. Rodgers must see something in him as he named him on the bench for the game with Fulham in May 2013. He has captained the Under-21s, and featured in the side more than any other player last season. At 19, thereâs plenty to learn, and a month at a League Two club may not reveal everything.
  
* **Kevin Stewart** - Difficult to say. The 21-year-old featured in the pre-season but is still an unknown entity at Anfield.",null,0,null,1421959696,null,0,false,0,cnxk2c0,null,t3_2tbpfa,null,t1_cnxk2c0,null,t3_2tbpfa,null,null,null,1424451246,null,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4,null

I would not force a mother to have or not have a child. In the majority of cases the system doesn't either but ""right to life"" organisation and the like are however noted.

Let us look at the experience of the father in all of this.

Abortion? No say.

Adoption? Not an option if the mother wants to keep the child the father is still financially responsible for a child he didn't consent to for the next 19 years, legal systems will work against him for money and in cases will lead to his imprisonment, even if he is unable to pay. Many cases of this in America. have a google by all means.

The real failing there was not replacing him rather than letting him go in the first place. And Agger was let go on the cheap, I'll admit, but wasnt getting game time and likely only wanted to move to Bronby, of his available options, so if we didn't take a hit on the transfer fee we could have been left paying high wages whilst his price continued to drop. 

Lucas on the other hand is our only senior, legitimate DM and has proved to be pivotal in recent weeks so letting him go would be insane.

You see, we love lads like this at Everton, our history is built on them (rather than the more flashy lads with haircuts across the park), and many fans see Besic as the reincarnation (along with McCarthy and perhaps Barkley) of our famed midfield trio of when we last won silverware in the mid 90s.

John Ebbrell, Joe Parkinson and Barry Horne were known as 'The Dogs of War'. They were not flashy players, but they didn't stop running, tackling and closing players down until the job was done. Besic and McCarthy are so similar to Parky and Ebbrell, and it has got a lot of fans remembering that era. 

We Evertonians love Besic (and Naismith, for similar reasons) more than others. They turn up, put their heart on the line and play like their life depends on it- graft is what built the stadium, the club and the whole city; so we love seeing it on the pitch. 

Whilst having wonderful, skillful players like Mirallas is great- it is always pointed out if he is selfish, or doesn't run as hard as we would like... But it is never pointed out that Besic or Naismith lacked the tekkers to do a defender and make some crazy run at goal like Kevin would have. This is different to a lot of clubs, where they want the exciting flair players, but that is just not us. 

That is not to say Besic doesn't have skill, he can pick out a pass and has good technique- but that is not what he is about for us.

Which to be honest sounds about right, too many people looking for too few jobs, a crappy HR job that used to go to someone straight out of high school now needs a university degree. 

I think if you want to live in the UK for a bit and you keep your expectations low then you could probably have a nice time here. Move to a big city apply for crappy jobs hopefully get one get the cheapest flat share you can and then see if you can get a better job. If you work in a call centre or somewhere you'll probably make some friends and you could have a nice year or so. You might not get the job you want, and you might lose any money paying rent while you look for a job. Bit also you might get a job pretty quickly and you might end up finding a job you'd rather do. 

So I wouldn't get into debt or anything to come here but if you have Â£1000 or so and want to risk it then go for it.

null,false,1havok,null,null,null,"&gt; 15,000Â£ in SS ISA invested in **index funds**.

An SS ISA is a tax wrapper. You can put in 15k this tax year in a Stocks and Shares ISA, it means you will not have to pay tax on any income within the fund (so capital gains in this instance). 

An index fund is basically a way to spread an invesment over a stock market. So the FTSE100 takes the top 100 companies in the UK, it buys a proportion of each by market capitalisation. So if one stock crashes it won't destroy your investment. [Look here for a general idea of how such investment may look over time, remember past trading history is not indicative of future prices](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=%5EFTSE#symbol=%5EFTSE;range=1d).  There are many indexes around the world, so you could invest in the US market (Dow or SP500, or emerging markets etc). It's seen as a good way to invest in the stock market, and reduce your risks. As for which index to choose, look into a range of them, you may wish to spread the index across multiple indexes/geographical areas to reduce your risk even more.

Importantly an index fund is a type of 'passive' investment, where there is no active fund manger. This means the costs are cheaper. Importantly these types of funds nearly always make a bigger return in the long term, some active fund managers may beat the fund in the short term (and a few in the long term), but you also need to take into account the risk they take in doing so. 

You don't want to mess around too much with stocks if you have a short time horizon, generally you want 5 years with stocks (to ride out any market dips). Even then you may not make back what you put in. 

So look for a cheap platform, Charles Stanley Direct is a popular cheap one. Then you could buy an index fund of a particular index, vanguard offers many good index funds. You will also need to decide which market indexes you wish to invest in. This would based on the risk you are willing to undertake. You won't find many people saying 'this is the best index to invest in right now'. The truth is nobody really knows, they just know some markets are more stable than others. 

So that should give you an idea of how it works. Importantly you need to decide when you need the money, are you looking to take money out in the near future (less than 5 years?) What is your attitude to risk? Do you care if you lose your original investment? Do you need that money for education in the future? Do you need money as an emergency fund for your first grad job etc?

Reus would be a great player and he'd fit in the team. But he's just not as good, and wide attacking midfielders are much more common than true box to box midfielders. Plus he's older, and not that it really matters but United fans would be suicidal if Pogba scored in a derby. Just imagine it.

* Can we just leave education alone for a couple of years so we can find out what all the changes are, be trained in how to react to them and just teach the same thing 2 years in a row so we have more than 6 months experience in our jobs. Readdress the role of OFSTED so they HELP schools to improve rather than inspecting them repeatedly thinking that actually helps ( some advice and demonstration of good practice would be nice)
* Tax avoidance comes in at number 3
* How can we actually balance the books so that outgoings as a nation does not exceed income and eventually we can start to think about paying back all those loans

* Globally, how can we help stabalise the many unstable areas in the world. This requires long term planning and negotiation. Our greatness as a nation is based on our ability to act as a go between and our excellent diplomatic skills

&gt;This document was drawn up in May 1880, when French workers' leader Jules Guesde came to visit Marx in London. The Preamble was dictated by Marx himself, while the other two parts of minimum political and economic demands were formulated by Marx and Guesde, with assistance from Engels and Paul Lafargue, who with Guesde was to become a leading figure in the Marxist wing of French socialism. The programme was adopted, with certain amendments, by the founding congress of the Parti Ouvrier (PO) at Le Havre in November 1880.

&gt;Concerning the programme Marx wrote: âthis very brief document in its economic section consists solely of demands that actually have spontaneously arisen out of the labour movement itself. There is in addition an introductory passage where the communist goal is defined in a few lines.â [1] Engels described the first, maximum section, as âa masterpiece of cogent argumentation rarely encountered, clearly and succinctly written for the masses; I myself was astonished by this concise formulationâ [2] and he later recommended the economic section to the German social democrats in his critique of the draft of the 1891 Erfurt Programme. [3]
french text from L'Egalite

&gt;**After the programme was agreed, however, a clash arose between Marx and his French supporters arose over the purpose of the minimum section. Whereas Marx saw this as a practical means of agitation around demands that were achievable within the framework of capitalism, Guesde took a very different view: âDiscounting the possibility of obtaining these reforms from the bourgeoisie, Guesde regarded them not as a practical programme of struggle, but simply ... as bait with which to lure the workers from Radicalism.â The rejection of these reforms would, Guesde believed, âfree the proletariat of its last reformist illusions and convince it of the impossibility of avoiding a workers â89.â [4] Accusing Guesde and Lafargue of ârevolutionary phrase-mongeringâ and of denying the value of reformist struggles, Marx made his famous remark that, if their politics represented Marxism, âce qu'il y a de certain c'est que moi, je ne suis pas Marxisteâ (âwhat is certain is that I myself am not a Marxistâ).

It was in the far north of the country, near the boarder of Siberia. There were two towns, separated only by a single road and each month, all the men from each of the two towns would meet on that dividing road and have a huge brawl in order to show supremacy. My barber, who grew up in this rivalry, started fighting at 12 years old and as he grew older, he became well known as the top fighter in the area, something of a local legend. He told me that one day, while he was preparing for battle, his mother and aunt had to leave, and they told him that he had to stay home and babysit his nephew for the evening. He promised that he would not go out and fight that night and everything would be fine. But, growing bored, he decided to go out and fight anyways. So he strapped on a baby carrier and took his nephew down to the road, where the other towns men were waiting. He sat the kid down under a street light and the battle commenced. As my barber was dueling with his opponents, he told me that he would periodically look over to the street light and check on his nephew. Each time he looked over, they made eye contact and his nephew held the stare and just watched him fight with fascination. My barber told me they won the battle that night and he was able to take the kid back home and his mom and aunt were none the wiser.

Some years later, his nephew grew up and became the top ranked karate champion in all of both Kazakstan AND Russia.",null,0,null,1421967596,null,0,false,0,cnxp168,null,t3_2tae0b,null,t1_cnxp168,null,t3_2tae0b,null,null,null,1424448857,null,6,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,6,null

The republican/democrat thing isnt exactly right, but it probably helps your understanding as theyre essentially two sides of the same horrible coin.

The Liberal Democrats are something of a third path to these two, but currently lean more to the left than Labour do (at least in this guys opinion). Theyre unfortunately bearing a mark of cain because of five years of coalition with the Tories and completely turning their coats in 2010. Before the election they campaigned on a platform of eradicating tuition fees and got a large amount of the student vote. There was such a wave of support it even got a name,[ Cleggmania](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cleggmania-spreads-across-britain-1947687.html). They then pissed this away by supporting the Tory government in tripling student fees after cutting the higher education budget by something like 80%.

Greens are like green parties everywhere - extremely popular with fringe voters but have a lot of policies that give pause for thought. They're idealistic to a fault without reconciling that idealised ideology to the realistic implementation.

UKIP are the dark horse of this election. Support for them has exploded in the last year and a half, although they were founded 20 years ago and been a far fringe vote since then. Similar to the greens, theyve never been anywhere near any real power and their manifesto (at least, when they get around to writing one - their head of policy got sacked this week for being only 5 months from the general election without a fecking manifesto either published or in the works) reflects it, with similarly ideologue-driven ideas that havent been tested and are very, very speculative. They're also the most colorful party in the sense that again, theyve never been near any real power so they've traditionally attracted a lot of the political fringe. Theyve been trying to be all things to all people under a certain over-reaching umbrella of being anti-EU and this attracts people of a certain disposition.

Possibly the best thing about UKIP's rise is that for the first time the traditional two-party stranglehold looks like its going to be broken wide open.

That about does it for a five minute precis, but you're probably better off by reading as much as you can as widely as you can to pick up things by osmosis.

If a company takes out a loan from the bank the bank then has an asset (the future promise of repayment of the loan, plus any interest payments) they can sell that asset like any other. So if the loan was for Â£10,000 and was expecting Â£3,000 worth of interest over its life I might come along and offer to buy from them now for a lump sum of Â£12,000. The most common form of this is government bonds, where people lend money to the government and in return receive interest on it. These are very commonly brought and sold and are considered a very safe investment, governments being fairly unlikely to go bankrupt.

Separate from that is the second point. Banks having something called capital ratios, which is the ratio of assets They have to the number of loans they make, their minimum capital ratios are set by legislation. So a bank with more money can make more loans. In addition because QE has mainly been done through govt bonds (which I described above) the return on your investment for owning govt bonds has dropped. Therefore investors who are looking for higher returns will put their money somewhere else, which will probably be riskier, govt bonds being about the safest thing there is.",null,0,null,1421969243,null,0,false,0,cnxpze2,null,t3_2ta4v5,null,t1_cnxpze2,null,t1_cnxnodo,null,null,null,1424448413,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Nevertheless I'll do my best to give a good idea of UKIP without being biased on the subject.

UKIP is a party which has formed on the basis of leaving the European Union, I won't go on to give you the pros and cons of this as I'd be biased on that front. In more recent years UKIP has slowly started gaining support mainly due to the leader of the party which could be seen as particularly charismatic, he likes to paint himself as the common man and talk ""common sense"".

UKIP tend to draw a lot of people in because of the fact they want a tighter immigration policy rather than the free movement of people between European countries and the UK that we currently have, some people around the country are deciding that our country is getting strained by immigration and thus turn to UKIP.

We elect people to represent us in Europe and in the last election UKIP topped the polls, this is the first time in about 100 years a party other than Labour or the Conservatives have won a national poll. This won't carry through to the General election but they will still take a big chunk of the vote. UKIP has been polling about 20% of the national vote, to put this into perspective the main parties(Labour+Conservatives) are polling around the 32% mark, UKIP's support however is very divided and spread across the country, whereas parties like Labour and the Conservatives have support centralised in particular areas which will allow them to get more seats, in light of this UKIP are likely to only get about 5 seats in parliament compared to the main parties which will be likely to get about 280.

null,false,NervousEnergy,null,null,null,"So, the political spectrum is split up between three ""main"" parties, several smaller parties, and several regional parties.

**Main Parties**

**The Labour Party**: formed in 1900 as a party representing the views of the urban proletariat. With heavy influence from the Trade Unions and socialist groups, the party was traditionally that of the working classes and the poor. Policies were based around labour laws (as the name suggests...), and was very pro-worker. Left leaning in both economic and social issues, they championed the nationalised industries of the UK. In the 1970s they were hit hard with the strikes that brought Britain to a standstill, and many people saw that the trade unionists had taken over the party and were going too far in their demands. They were ousted out of power for a full 18 years and were seen to be floundering. ""New Labour"" was formed in the early 1990s, as a way to drag the party into the modern age by moving policies into the centre (third-way politics), so as to be more attractive to the broad middle class voters. Tony Blair was the most famous of the New Labourites, and he became Prime Minister in 1997 in a landslide election. During his Premiership, we saw Labour move further into the centre, and take on some 'right wing' policies such as fairly draconian surveillance and anti-terror laws. New Labour was also quietly against state control of industries, and promoted capitalism and businesses. Discontent over the Iraq/Afghanistan War , the deficit, and Tony Blair, saw the New Labour brand become fairly toxic to the electorate and Labour was voted out in 2010. Ed Miliband, current Labour Leader, has been fairly derided in the press for being uncharismatic and for having no real policies. The Labour Party is unique in that it sort of has another independent political party *inside* it; The Co-Operative Party which, as the name suggests, stands for co-operation in politics. There is still a split between the New Labour/Blairites who advocate centre-policies, and the Old Labour group who are more traditionally left leaning. 

Currently the general policies of Labour are centre when it comes to economic issues, and slightly centre-left when it comes to economic issues.  

**The Conservative Party**: formed in the 19th century as a faction of the Whig Party. Nicknamed ""The Tories"", referencing a political group from the 17th century. The party was generally for the land owners and upper and middle classes of the countryside, and exposed traditional social and religious values, pro business and capitalism. They followed Labour by embracing workers rights, but in the 1970s won a landslide under the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher, who fought hard to dismantle the Trade Unions; which she was quite successful in doing. Thatcher also took charge of privatising the nationalised industries (telecom, railways, power, water, steel, etc), which many people saw as ""selling off the country to the highest bidder"", although you have to understand that many of these industries in the county at the time were horribly bureaucratic, inefficient, and expensive to run. Thatcher also moved the UK economy from that of an exporter of heavy manufacturing to services, primarily financial. She saw we were unable to compete with the developing nations when it came to cutting manufacturing costs. She adopted a free market policy, promoting businesses and entrepreneurship. However, after 11 years in power and a split within the party, she was finally ousted out in a leadership challenge in 1990. In the 21st century, the Conservatives have modernised their image to appeal to a wider base of voters. Socially they have adopted some traditional left policies, such as gay marriage. David Cameron, in his Premiership, saw tackling the deficit and restarting the economy as the main issues. He has shrunk the state, and has continued to privatise parts of the economy, continuing the promotion of businesses and capitalist ideals. He has been much criticised for welfare reforms, and the rise of 'zero-hour' contracts and short-term employment. There is a certain split in the party between the progressive conservatives, and the traditional right wing faction.

Currently the general policies of the Conservatives are centre-right when it comes to economic issues, and centre when it comes to social issues.

**The Liberal Democrats**: formed in the 1980s as a merger between two liberal parties. As the name suggests the Lib Dems are a social-liberal party with left-leaning policies. They were always the smallest party of the main three, and especially in the beginning were often seen as a 'protest' vote. They appealed mainly to the young and middle classes, with policies promoting environmentalism, progressive taxation, and liberal social and political reform. Social liberalism has always been an important stance, although economically the party is split between 'Orange Bookers' who promote businesses and laissez faire economics, and the 'Social Liberals' who advocate state intervention and more socialist ideals. After much media attention during the 2010 election cycle, the Lib Dems were seen as 'The Kingmaker'; able to go into a coalition with either Labour or Conservatives to ensure an electoral victory. In the end they became the junior partner in the current Coalition Government with the Conservative Party, a partnership seen by many Lib Dem voters as betrayal considering the policies and ideology between both parties were nearly opposite. Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats and Deputy Prime Minister, was much derided for breaking his 'electoral promise' on rising university tuition fees; under this Government fees have tripled. As such, the student voters (which made up a large percentage of the Lib Dem electorate) fled the party and support plummeted. In the coalition, the Lib Dems has been seen as dampening several right wing policies of the Conservatives and introducing several liberal policies (such as rising the tax threshold). Unfortunately their main political stance, electoral reform, failed at a public referendum. 

Currently the general policies of the Liberal Democrats are left-wing socially, and centre economically; although supporters would say they don't fit into either the traditional left/right wing camps and instead are all about ""Liberalism"". 

**Minor Parties**

**United Kingdom Independence Party**: formed in 1993 as a ""single issue"" party; being against the European Union and what they saw as dangerous integration, and the giving up of national sovereignty to the European Parliament. They want to withdraw from the EU (as the name suggests..), and this is their main electoral promise. Seen as a minor fringe party for most of their years, they gained sudden traction in 2013 and won several local council elections. Discontent with the EU and the Coalition Government saw them gaining big wins in the 2014 EU elections, and membership and vote-share prediction continue to go up and up. Current polls put them at 15% - 20% of the national vote, which is a massive rise in such a short period of time. UKIP, as they are known, are a right-wing party which has populist policies. They aim at the working classes, saying that Labour no longer represents their interests. They are also libertarian; wanting a much smaller state and promoting capitalism and free market economics. However several of their social policies are right wing instead of libertarian, such as being against gay marriage. They are much seen as representing ""traditional British values"", and wanting to cut down heavily on immigration which they see unintegration as a huge threat to the social and economic fabric of society. Several members have been called out for spouting racist, sexist, or homophobic ideas in private and in public. 

Currently, the general policies of UKIP are right-wing socially and right-wing economically. 

**The Green Party**: Three independent parties representing England &amp; Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. As the name suggests, they promote environmentalism above all others. Part of the world-wide Green movement, founded in the 1970s, the Green Party is socially and economically liberal and left-wing. They want state ownership of key industries/utilities, sustainability in resources, and progressive social and political change. To this end they have policies such as cutting the defence budget, lowering the national speed limit, banning GM crops, banning nuclear power, and banning testing on animals. The party is split between the 'watermelons' who want less extreme policies to promote to the majority of the electorate, and the 'kiwis' who still support the rather extreme green policies such as mandatory vegetarianism. They won a seat in the last General Election and have seen a surge in support, with a lot of disgruntled Liberal Democrats joining them as the only other left-wing party in England.

**Scottish National Party**: Founded in the 1930s, as a protest party demanding Scottish independence. They stand only in Scotland, and are seen to be what old Labour used to be like: promoting left-leaning policies and socialism. Scotland was given devolved powers in the 1990s, with it's own Parliament. The SNP quickly came to dominate Scottish national politics, and was widely seen as an alternative to Labour. In the 2007 and 2011 Scottish Elections, the SNP came out as the largest party; they promised an Independence Referendum. This happened in September last year, and was widely reported in the news. The referendum was close, but came down on the side of Scotland staying in the UK. The SNP has continued to grow in support, with many Scots seeing the Coalition Government as unable to represent the interests of the Scottish people. David Cameron presented a ""New Deal"" today, promising further devolution and powers to the Scottish Government. Nevertheless the May election is predicting big gains for the SNP in Scottish seats.

Currently, the general policies of the Scottish National Party are centre left-wing economically and centre left-wing socially. 

**Plaid Cymru:** Formed in 1925, they also advocate independence for Wales from the United Kingdom. Following a similar history as the SNP, Plaid Cymru has never gained as much support regionally although do hold a number of seats in the Welsh Assembly. Their policies are centre left-wing economically and centre left-wing socially. 

**Northern Ireland**. I am in no way knowledgeable of Northern Irish politics. Suffice to say they have their own regional Parliament, and this is split between the Unionist parties (mainly the Democratic Unionist Party) and the National parties (mainly Sinn FÃ©in).

True. In terms of membership that doesn't matter too much...See UKIP have 24 MEPs, while the SNP have 2. And they have a much larger vote share than the SNP.

&gt; They just don't run outside of Scotland, but they will have a much bigger impact on the resulting UK parliament than UKIP and the Greens and very possibly the Lib Dems.

I don't know. UKIP will have a large impact on who wins what seat in England...They're taking votes of Labour and the Tories, which will probably work in Labours favour.. The Greens will take votes off Labour, possibly getting the Tories some seats. The SNP will take many seats off of Labour, but I'm not sure they'll agree to a coalition with the SNP.

The House of Lords is the upper house, and is 790 members strong. Originally members of this house were all literally hereditary Lords; members of the aristocracy who passed down the title and the membership to the oldest son, with significant land ownership. This was changed in 1999, and now only 92 hereditary peers sit there. 26 of the House of Lords are the 'Lords Spiritual'; Bishops from the Church of England. The rest of the sitting members are ""Life Peers"", which in **theory** are experts in various fields (politics, law, medicine, science) who have been promoted to the House for contribution to society. However in real life we often see the various political parties parachuting in ex-Members of Parliament to try and swing the House of Lords into their favour. 

Parliamentary stages of a Government Bill are as follows: 

&gt; **First reading**

&gt; Introducing the Bill to the House of Commons. 

&gt; **Second reading**

&gt; This is a debate on the main principles of the Bill. At the end of the debate the House will vote on the Bill. 

&gt; **Committee stage**

&gt; This is a line-by-line consideration of the detail of the Bill by committees, including incorporation of any amendments.

&gt; **Report stage**

&gt; Reporting on any amendments added to the Bill.

&gt; **Third reading**

&gt; Another general discussion of the Bill in the House of Commons. 

&gt; **Bill sent to House of Lords**

&gt; First Reading, second reading, report stage, third reading as previous.

&gt; **Bill sent back to House of Commons**

&gt; Any amendments made by the House of Lords must be considered. If agreement can't be reached, then the Bill moves back to the House of Lords. A Bill may move backwards and forwards between the two Houses before agreement is reached, so this stage is sometimes called âping pongâ. In certain occasions the House of Commons can invoke the *Parliament Act*, which in essence vetoes any decision made by the House of Lords.

&gt; **Royal Assent**

If true:

If Inter are coming to buy Lucas, my guess is that LFC have a deal for Fabian Delph essentially tied up.  Jordan Rossiter is tipped to play against Bolton which makes sense and Emre Can would most likely got to he holding position with either Glen Johnson or Lovren slotting into the back three during the season and semi final cups matches if they don't sign Delph.  

If bullshit:
This is just the president dipping his nuts into the water to see who bites.  If he is in the market for a DM England is a good place to look.  Mikel, Schneiderlein, Ramires (to a degree), Paulinho, or any of the other CM's tottenham has.  


I think this is a legit story though.  I think Lucas gets sold.  Lucas is a great destroyer and disrupter but going forward he is not as accomplished as I think Rodgers wants.

People used to (2000 onward-ish) vote SNP in Scottish Elections then Labour in the General election. For the simple fact that the SNP had a good shot at seats/power in Holyrood (Partly popularity, partly the STV voting system) but didn't at Westminster. Labour *do* have a shot at Westminster so if you don't vote for them you're just wasting the vote and helping the Tories out.

Since the referendum it has became abundantly clear to lots of people that voting Labour for Westminster to try and keep the Tories out then *hoping* they'll do good things for Scotland isn't actually working and isn't the best way to go about it, for a number of reasons;

1) Willingly entering into a negative campaign with the Tories in the referendum. Labour brought in devolution, Labour are supposed to represent the masses against things like Tory austerity. They didn't have to support independence but they could have at least came at unionism from a different angle than they did.

2) Offering the least amount of devolution post-referendum. Again, supposed to be the party of devolution but is more interested in maintaining their own vision of it than giving people what they want.

3) Making it clear they'll get in the way of EVEL which might have got in the way of further devolution if Cameron was serious about linking the two.

4) It's abundantly clear the Scottish *branch* of Labour is treated like a child organisation, doesn't have the authority do what it thinks is best for Scotland so.. why the hell would we make them government?

5) They seem pathologically incapable of accepting that SNP support is genuine. They have this weird *ownership* thing about Scottish votes and they think we're all off wearing Yellow ribbons just to piss them off, maybe if they mention they're patriotism more often we'll come back.

6) Scotland voting Labour doesn't *actually* stop a Tory government. If England wants one it gets one, we're not big enough to really influence it so why are we trying when we could vote for who we actually want?

The SNP however have shown pretty much the complete opposite. They've been competent in government, they've delivered things they promised and finally through the referendum they've shown they aren't scared of going toe-to-toe with the big parties to get what they want or even working with idealogical opposites to do it. They are far from perfect of course, there's a bit of superiority complex in there and I don't like some of the social policies. 

Also (and your opinion may differ on this) but the SNP have in the past had to get Conservative support to get budgets through, I think that's a good thing and is how you get good government. 

So the time has come to abandon Labour at Westminster. We'll send the SNP, their mandate is extremely clear and the cards will fall where they do. If I was to sum it up I'd say the political borders of Britain have solidified, the Scottish electorate no longer views itself as just another collection of British constituencies but as a nation that should arrive at Wesminster with good intentions but also demands. Maybe that's a good thing, maybe it isn't. We'll see. 

Ultimately we just don't *need* Labour any more. The SNP are better at filling the centre left role and it's a more honest exchange between them and the Conservatives. Labour are just an incoherent mess stuck in the middle who hate everyone for really creepy 'voter allegiance' reasons.",null,0,null,1421975756,null,0,false,0,cnxtpza,null,t3_2tauxw,null,t1_cnxtpza,null,t3_2tauxw,null,null,null,1424446669,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

I've heard it with Origi, Ibe and Rossiter this window and hear it every window.  

Each athlete is different, some derive great strength from the pressure, others shrink away from it.  The managers and people around them know this, they are professionals and deal with pressure all the time.  They see how they play in cup matches, U18 and U21s, see if they have the maturity and character to go through it.  Pressure is a part of life and more so in competition.  But being under pressure and put in those situations makers them better players.  

Even if they fail, which all players do, they need to learn to overcome that, giving them the mental steel to be a complete player.  

Origi played in the World Cup for his country for fucks sake and people on the subbreddit are against brining him here because of the imaginary pressure to have him get us into top four that no one would ever think is real.

Part of the appeal of the book is that it portrays Cromwell in a much more sympathetic light than most other interpretations; he is usually showed as something of a villain. 


The other thing is that the book is written in the present tense, so, to quote a review, it gives a ""vivid sense that what we now regard as history (and therefore as somehow inevitable) is something that once unfolded â and unfolded uncertainly â in real time.""

They are wankers, but their own fans aren't booing them. Opposition fans are.

For example I think opposition fans would see Soldado as a wanker (he has a bit of a penchant for the elbow), but he's pretty well liked around here (though not for his footballing ability).

There must obviously be examples of white players who are lazy and don't go the full mile for their team, rather picking up their pay check. But are they booed by their own fans? I'm not sure.

It's an important question and there's no definite answer.

Maybe look at it from Adebayor's perspective, you come in you already are the odd one out coming from Togo and all, and then you go out on the pitch and you fell you've put in a good shift, closing down defenders and idk maybe scoring a goal. Then you find out people are calling you lazy, when it seems to you you've put in just as much effort as a local player in your position. That might make you a) put in less effort as you're not happy and feel like you aren't getting the credit you deserve, or b) push on to disprove this and fight a possible stereotyping of you.

I don't believe you are sorry you are simply trying to demonise me because you can't counter the argument. I've seen this many times before from people such as yourself.

Would you for instance attack my support of abortion and a women's rights to choose by calling me a baby killer?

I can also supply rope and please be aware the questions coming your way can be answered by you at any time. If you feel you cannot answer them due to the narrative restraints of your chosen ideology, by all means say.

&gt; what exactly do you mean by 'men's reproductive rights'?

Men have no legal protection to insure they are not forced to become parents, I want them to have that right. It's a pretty clear concept with perhaps difficult answers, just as difficult as women's reproductive rights. Which is why you have stereotypically fallen back on emotional responses in an attempt to distract from the issue, hence the continued straw manning.

You continually focus on consepts like abandonment, again a straw man but I'll address it by quoting the relevant mens section of the wiki on [reproductive rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights)

&gt;Recently men's reproductive right with regards to paternity have become subject of debate in the U.S. The term ""male abortion"" was coined by Melanie McCulley, a South Carolina attorney, in a 1998 article. The theory begins with the premise that when a woman becomes pregnant she has the option of abortion, adoption, or parenthood; it argues, in the context of legally recognized gender equality, that in the earliest stages of pregnancy the putative (alleged) father should have the right to relinquish all future parental rights and financial responsibility, leaving the informed mother with the same three options.[26] This concept has been supported by a former president of the feminist organization National Organization for Women, attorney Karen DeCrow.[27] The feminist argument for male reproductive choice contends that the uneven ability to choose experienced by men and women in regards to parenthood is evidence of a state-enforced coercion favoring traditional sex roles.[28]
In 2006, the National Center for Men brought a case in the US, Dubay v. Wells (dubbed by some ""Roe v. Wade for men""), that argued that in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, when an unmarried woman informs a man that she is pregnant by him, he should have an opportunity to give up all paternity rights and responsibilities. Supporters argue that this would allow the woman time to make an informed decision and give men the same reproductive rights as women.[29][30] In its dismissal of the case, the U.S. Court of Appeals (Sixth Circuit) stated that ""the Fourteenth Amendment does not deny to [the] State the power to treat different classes of persons in different ways.""

So don't panic, above is a situation where abandonment isn't even an issue and all around I think thats pretty fair. I'd like to see that law in place for all men globally, but at this point in our social evolution we should certainly have it in the westernised ""modern"" world. In existing instances I would expect the state to step in and relieve the financial burden of men who did not consent to parenthood and have no contact with their children. A parent may not retain contact and avoid the financial responsibility that comes with consensual reproduction unless there are extenuating circumstances including but not limited to; Disability, Poverty, Imprisonment.

null,false,almodozo,null,null,null,"OK, following up on my earlier reply, I spent way too much time looking into the point you were making, because I thought it was a salient one.

In my other reply I already found that the reason Labour is perceived to be at 3.0 on the left-right scale in England -- more to the left than I would have imagined -- is indeed at least in part because a majority of Tory and UKIP voters place it all the way on the far left, at 0-2. You had that right.

Now I wanted to see if English voters of different parties saw Labour as further to the left as their counterparts in Scotland; or if the placements were the same and the difference in the topline result is just because Tory and UKIP voters make up a larger share of the electorate in England, like you suggested.

To do this I first used the British Election Study's ""Data Playground"" to retrieve the relevant data. Unfortunately, it only provides the data from the May-June 2014 ""wave"" of the study, not yet those of the September/October wave used in the blog post. That's relevant because, as the post pointed out, ""the two biggest changes"" between the two waves ""were those of Scottish Labour and the SNP"", with the former becoming seen as more right-wing (3.6 to 4.0) and the latter as more left-wing (4.2 to 3.9).

It was still worth a look though, because even in the May/June wave there was already a difference: English respondents then placed Labour at 3,0 too, and Scottish ones at 3,6. So the question of what caused that difference remains the same.

Using the ""Playground"" data, I calculated the mean score for how supporters of each individual party positioned Labour on the left-right scale. I also calculated how large a share of the total number of respondents the supporters of each party made up. And then I created variable width column charts for England and Scotland to show both things at the same time: how voters of each party rated the Labour Party and how many there were of each.

Here's the result for England: http://i.imgur.com/bn5VaHr.png

The mean score is indeed pulled down by Tory and UKIP perceptions, but perhaps surprisingly Labour's own voters also placed the party fairly far to the left, at 3.4. Only Green voters were more skeptical, and placed Labour pretty close to the center point, at 4.2

Here's the result for Scotland: http://i.imgur.com/unCidnm.png

In Scotland, too, Tory and UKIP voters place the party far to the left, at 2.4 and 2.8. Their estimate is almost identical to that of their English counterparts. Moreover, the Scottish Labour voters placed their party at 3.5, also almost identical to how their English counterparts rated Labour. Instead, the chart shows that the overall placement of Labour on the left-right scale is pulled to the right mainly because SNP and Green voters place it much closer to the center. There are no SNP voters in England, of course, so this really weighs into the difference.

In short: you were definitely on to something. Here's a final chart, in order to make a direct comparison: http://i.imgur.com/k9QiNwD.png

You see that there are some, minor differences in how Scottish and English voters of respective parties perceive Labour: the Scottish Libdems and Greens, in particular, are more skeptical (or in the Greens' case, I should say ""even more skeptical"") about Labour being a left-wing party than their English counterparts. But Tory, UKIP and Labour voters in Scotland and England pretty much position the Labour Party in the same way; the only difference there is that Tory and UKIP voters just weigh more heavily into the total in England, while in Scotland there are SNP voters, who pull the number into the other direction. The only other factor is the opinion of those who had no party preference, said they wouldn't vote, or preferred one of the smallest parties: their number in Scotland also saw Labour as less left-wing than their counterparts in England.",null,0,null,1421979879,null,0,false,0,cnxw14q,null,t3_2tamuf,null,t1_cnxw14q,null,t1_cnxcqwp,null,null,null,1424445545,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

They don't have to consider the effects of inequality or the human cost nor do they have to worry about history or what public opinion will dictate. It's an intelligent, useful point of view but I'm not going to take any lectures from them on this place.

Chadli (excellent this season! been extremely pleased with his progression) and Eriksen (who, really, should never play in a winger's position. We need him dictating play in the middle of the park.

In order of positions in, I think we need:

Left Midfielder (Konoplyanka, Mirallas (or is he right wing?)?)

Striker (...)

CB (Moreno?)

After the weekend match you'll get some post match reaction meh. Is it worth it to buy now.. maybe not. If you want to watch pre season matches in the summer then I recommend.

It's interesting to see the tables turned in this regard. The conservatives are popular and on a percentage share of the vote actually did the best last election. However a large part of the reason they have so many MPs is traditionally the right wing vote is not split while the left has always been split particularly in relation to Labour and Libdem. 

In this election the left vote will only be split in Scotland and Wales, however the conservatives don't stand a chance there anyway. In England, the country the conservatives have to win by a fairly good margin to hold a majority in the UK parliament, the left vote is more unified than any time since 1922 and UKIP are splitting the right wing votes.
