I think he gets that reputation for a few reasons. 

First, Ivanovic is our RB. Compare any other RB/LB in the EPL (other than maybe Baines) to Brana and they are going to come up lacking in the attacking department. 

Second, Azpi tends to stay back and defend a lot more. It's not that he's a bad attacker, it's just that he doesn't attack often (I'm thinking this is probably because we have Ivanovic getting forward so often). 

Finally, our right side winger is Hazard. It's much easier to just lay the ball off to Hazard and act as an outlet for Hazard, than to push forward and over commit. Hazard is the type of player you want on the ball all the time, the Dave abides.

My guess is that since attitudes back then were considerably different they would have seen it as leverage, and something to hide.

I am reminded of watching the Yes Minister special where Hacker becomes PM by this. The whips knew why ministers could not become PM and what skeletons were in their closets. 

A former whip has also commented that back then it would have been seen as something for them to protect MPs and something to use as leverage.

What I want to point out is the hypocrisy of the public. How much would _you_ have done. Would you be the whistleblower? Would you risk your career being destroyed - or maybe even bumped off by the specials - by exposing it if all you could do was make an accusation against the establishment, who would see to it that nothing happened? 

What if it was something not quite as bad. What if it was an MP going to prostitutes and someone whispered in your ear that they were east europeans coerced into it?

Nope. No blog. I considered it for a little while but there are already so many good ones out there I wouldn't contribute much. Maybe in the future I'll look at guest writing or something on others' blogs. 

I would never say tactics is an esoteric theory; when you're watching a game it's hard to pick out little movements that ultimately change the make-up of a movement unless you're focusing on it. Even though, you may have to watch two or three times to see it. 

I watch a lot of games with friends and I am always looking looking away from the ball, observing the singular movement or cohesive movement of players. Trying to figure out what instructions managers are giving to their players is one of my favourite things to do. That said, when a game is exciting, I just sit back and enjoy it and forget about the nuances of tactical theory. 

A great book to read is *Inverting The Pyramid* -- goes back to the start and discusses how the game as evolved with styles and influence of tactical displays throughout the ages. 

[Zonal Marking](http://www.zonalmarking.net) is a great place to go too. I'm a little critical of some of the analysis that comes out of there as I feel it tries to impress some expectation of clubs, mainly what a club should be expected to do and not simply what they only did, but 9/10 times it's bang on. Others treat it as the gospel so I mean take what you want from it.

We always do our best to find out all sides of a story. As promised, here is a statement from Pets at Home following the story that we shared earlier about the tragic death of a family pet:

This was an extremely tragic situation and we have investigated it fully. Please find below the response from Arthur, the vet who attended to the cat:
_______________________________________
""To all the people commenting, I wanted to assure you that this poor cat was suffering from chronic renal failure and had been for some time. The cat was presented to us as a stray by a concerned member of the public who felt sorry for him and took it upon herself to bring him to the vets.
She firstly asked us to check for a microchip. None were detected and he didn't have any other means of identification. She then asked for him to be examined by a vet.
I have 12 years of experience as a vet and was able to diagnose and recognise the severity of the cat's condition as a result of a thorough, clinical examination.
The cat was very thin and had lost an awful lot of weight. He was very dehydrated, had very smelly uraemic breath (and no tartar or oral disease to be anything else). I examined his abdomen and his left kidney was grossly enlarged. I could also feel a knobbly irregular indented surface which indicates renal infarction and major internal damage in the kidney. We discussed blood tests, but I subsequently advised that the poor cat was too far gone and that putting him to sleep was the kindest option. He was given an injection and drifted slowly off to sleep while being stroked by the young lady and the vet.
Let me assure you that I would only ever take these actions as a last resort. I am a great animal lover and have four rescue cats at home, three of whom were nursed back to health following severe road traffic accidents and kept by me when no one claimed them.
I'd like to express my sympathies to the cat's family at this difficult time, and I am sorry that this decision was made without them being present.""

He's contributed much more to City than KdB, Salah, or even Schurrle to Chelsea. 


Cesc and Oscar are both versatile players who are asked to fill different roles depending on the situation. His flexibility and experience (WC winner, excellent premiere league player) are why Mourinho preferred Cesc to KdB in my view. How would KdB look in Chelsea's double pivot and would he be able to maintain effectiveness if the formation switches to a 3 man midfield? That's the question. KdB has been great in the Bundesliga but there is a difference between a player who stands out as the best on a mid-to-upper table side and someone who stands out on a team competing for every trophy like Chelsea. That's not to say that players who are doing very well for a smaller club can't step up but sometimes they can't adapt. If he maintains his form I'm sure another big club will snap up KdB and then we'll see. With regard to Oscar, his role at Chelsea has always been as much about man-marking key midfielders and disrupting buildup play as creating. KdB simply does not have the defensive quality or tactical awareness to put in the performances Oscar has.

Broadly though, with FFP Chelsea have to sell and sell high in order to bring in players. So far we've done an excellent job at selling players while their value was still high without being significant contributors to the squad. Lukaku fits here as well.

null,false,Bobsled_team,lfc68,,null,"Gerrard really is just the next of a series of players this sub loves to completely write off. It's been a real trend this year: Mignolet was shite and had to leave until he didn't; Allen was shite and had to leave until he didn't; Lovren was shite and had to leave, and the opinion of him is in the process of rapidly, drastically changing the way it has with several of our players. 

Gerrard had a few weeks where he played beyond his fitness and didn't perform superbly, culminating in his injury. One solid performance, even if it's against Blackburn, will go a long way in completely changing his narrative in his sub. All 3 of the players I mentioned before made their turnaround after lengthy lay-offs, two as a result of injury. 

I expect to get one of those 'but he's been poor all year, not just for a few weeks' responses, but Gerrard was poor after arguably the worst disappointment of his entire career (which is virtually all on his shoulders), a truly abysmal WC showing from England in his final international tournament (and as captain), and during a poor, transition period for the entire squad. 

Don't play Gerrard out of sentiment, play Gerrard because he's been, and is, a fantastic player. If he comes back and doesn't perform, so be it. If anyone is going to come back motivated and able to contribute, It's Gerrard. He had a rough first half of the season following more than a decade of stellar performances (including last season). Show a little faith. 

Edit: TL;DR: Gerrard doesn't deserve to play out of sentiment, but because he's a great player. We constantly write off players (Mignolet, Allen, Lovren, Lucas, even Henderson once upon a time) and one performance changes the entire narrative. Gerrard's talent, not his legacy, warrants the same opportunity. 

Double edit: This should be read as a response to the general attitude of this sub towards Gerrard, not only in response to this post.  Gerrard absolutely should have to earn his place, not just have it given to him.  That's sort of the point.

However, on a much brighter note, things are almost cleared up at work (and hopefully I'll still be employed!) and I can resume my duties and what not as a moderator on my mam's laptop. 


Personally I'm going to try and co-ordinate a watch thread for non-city match discussion as well as throwing a few fun games in here and there with prizes. I plan on writing a guide on ""your first visit to a match"" for supporters who are unfortunate enough not to have the opportunity to attend when they want, and I'll set up match threads too when available. People are welcome to contact me with any questions or whatnot and I'll do my best to reply asap. If you have any suggestions too on what you would like to see on this sub, please drop me a message. I hope you all enjoy the improvements we'll be making to the sub over the next few weeks

In China, high school is extremely hard. Its not uncommon for students to study 14-16 hours a day. They really pull out all the stops to get great grades to get into great universities. Once they get in, they're done. They will graduate from a great university with all the prestige that comes with it. The work is done, they've got to uni, now the hard work part is over. They can relax and take it easy!

He's made his money, pulled his strings, gone down in history. Half the things he promised he would do, he hasn't done. And we know this.

I can understand where you are coming from but everything is not the west's fault although that's what the middle east and our own governments tell us on a daily basis. 

We like Russia basically decided to try and invite the middle east on the world stage of global power, Russia tried to teach and give technology to Afghan that ended up in a war. Where Afghan was using the west and Russia. While Saudi Arabia was training Muslims to fight in the war, taught them their religion which ended up creating Al-Qaeda, after the war, we the west stepped in decided to send their young to be taught in our schools they came back basically Atheists, decided to give farmers equal lands and enabled peasants to have land, the farmers were ticked off and banded together known as the Taliban. Saudi Arabia uses money from the US to make mosques and madras in all corners of the world where the majority of the mosques are teaching Muslims Saudi's religion which in turn is the same religion as ISIS.

  I'll address that last paragraph first. I would be telling a lie if I said I was the world's best Muslim, and in my everyday life yes, there are those things which I do/think/say or whatever which may seem at odds with my Islam. However i don't see my faith as being some magic wand where when I say shahadah I become some superhuman. Rather each day I work on it to become better. 

  It's not that I hate Britain- I'm not some female Anjem Choudary. Rather I feel greatly let down as a citizen of the UK and I would even go so far as to say I feel I have no future here. Assuming I do end up moving to the Balkans, I will feel very angry I had to move 1500 miles just for the chance of having something approaching a normal life. 

  As a Muslim I feel pushed out of a society I grew up in because of a decision I made to believe something. You cannot possibly understand what it's like to have someone you've known all your life stop talking to you when she sees you in a hijab. Or to have a complete stranger threaten to kill you in the middle of the street, in public, with no-one around batting an eyelid. 

  I am beginning however to think that I may be aiming my anger in the wrong place- rather than aiming it at the British population generally it would be better to redirect it towards the causes of the problems I have and the people who caused them. 

I could always try becoming a politician myself and actually changing things...

I went through the atheism thing with Dawkins, Hitchins, Harris and the like a few years ago and it made me realize people don't ""quit"" religion...It's like quicksand. You need to pull people out slowly and willingly, because if you try and drag them kicking and screaming you'll just make them sink ever deeper into it.

Disclaimer: I'm sure someone, somewhere in our world of 7 billion people is an exception, but in general it's not a very productive approach.

As far as comparing religion to a physical addiction people *want* to quit but can't? I don't view your analogy quite as kindly as DogBotherer. Cigarettes are objectively harmful and addictive.

null,false,rtuck99,null,null,null,"I think you probably need to take a step back and sort out your money strategy. Wonga is a very expensive way of borrowing money. The key to comparing the cost of loans is to compare APR, which will show you that Wonga is 1500% vs 20% for a typical credit card (or 0 if you pay back in the interest free period). In fact if you choose the right credit card you get cashback which means they pay you rather than the other way round.

The key to getting out of this mess is to ensure you have sufficient float in your account to avoid going overdrawn if something unexpected comes up. That means saving up a bit over time for a while until you have enough in your current account to cover your monthly bills, plus any likely ""rainy day"" things like car repairs. Depending on your outgoings that's probably somewhere between £1500 - 4000. Note that ideally it needs to have that amount in it all the time, not just for the 3 days between pay day and when all your bills go out, because if there's a hiccup and you get paid late, or Scottish power randomly change their billing date, then you are screwed.

You need to get out of the mindset of ""My account has money, I'm fine"" when it only has only £500 in it, into ""My safety margin is not big enough, I need to spend less"".

You can get a bit of a medium-term breather by arranging for a standing overdraft facility of say £1000, which should be seen like the equivalent of a nicotine patch - something less bad to help you quit borrowing which is easier than going cold turkey.

However the benefits of achieving your buffer zone are worth it. Once you reach it, you don't have to worry about individual bills and instead only have to think about overall spending, which means you can do things like save money by setting up direct debits, and paying up-front instead of monthly.

I'm a fan of the Baltimore Ravens in the NFL (hand-egg team, USA). They release tried and true veterans but we (usually) keep on winning because of the signings we make. We have a fantastic manager named Ozzie Newsome who makes brilliant signings. It's gotten to the point where he's been right so many times (Justin Forsett, a nobody veteran that guided us to the playoffs, this past season IN; Jacoby Jones, a great receiver and kick returner, this offseason OUT) that we've adopted the phrase ""In Ozzie We Trust"". This came after losing many of our talismans or fan favorites because Ozzie thought they were surplus to the salary cap (think FFP). And for the most part, he's been right.

I typed all of that because of the parallel with Chelsea. Mourinho and the board know the type of players we need and if they will fit in the system (or they figure it out after a season). As much as it killed me I can understand why he let Mata go. Price aside, Oscar is a like-for-like substitute and offers so much more defensive contributions. Luiz for 50 mil?? You can't turn that down. Salah was probably in the top 3 fastest Prem players but he couldn't finish (in England). He's doing great now - which I love - but he wasn't good enough for a top 4 Prem team. Schurrle ....I don't know what happened there except he seemed to always be shooting instead of passing to a better positioned Costa. Sturridge-esqe you might say. Trying to earn his place in the side at the detriment of the team. I should say still I'm a huge fan of his and hope that he as well finds success. 


Cuadrado, I hope, will justify his price tag. Willian seems to be a Ramires but with better defensive skills yet terrible finishing. Cuadrado didn't impress out of the gate but I'm sure he has some magic in him that we just haven't seen yet.

What I want to know is whether we'll pick up another CDM after going through what we did. Or can Ake play there?

Absolutely. It's a fine balancing act that BR has ahead of him to keep SG involved but not jeopardise the form of the current lineup.  I do not want him sidelined, nor do I want the possibility of a CL spot to be risked for sentimentality.

Damn, the way that comes across is that SG is a liability. Not intended, but his stamina is understandably not that of players 10 years his junior.

I also though he was on the wane in the first half of last season before Suarez kicked into gear and the team was reshaped to the SaS attack. 

This was always going to be his final season. Let's hope it's a fitting send-off to a stellar servant to the club.

And I'm talking actual specifics here, not what people reckon.

Just imagine for a second that we lived in a country where the broadcasters were biased and deliberately set up a flawed and unfair system designed specifically to screw over the Tories because they wanted to. The Tories, opposing said system, refused to take part and raised a legal challenge to it. In such a situation, the fact that they had been invited to turn up would be irrelevant, as would the fact that everyone else wanted to go along with it, and to then empty chair them and give 90 minutes of free prime time coverage to the other parties would be a partisan and biased situation. In such a situation, it would be unfair for the event to go ahead.

Back to reality. What do we have codified in writing to say that Cameron cannot decide not to turn up? Absolutely nothing. The leaders debates have only happened once when everyone agreed, there are no accepted and agreed-upon rules in deciding this.

Literally the only direct thing Ofcom has here is that the debates will be decided with agreement between the Broadcasters and the major parties, which in this situation has not been reached.

null,false,VincentKompanini,,Old Growler,null,"Once upon a time there was a guy who pretended to be called Vincent for the purposes of an Internet website. One Saturday afternoon Vincent fancied some classic Heinz Tomato Soup, so he utilised his vast culinary expertise to heat some of the aforementioned soup up in a pan. 

Upon completing this arduous task, Vincent took the bowl of soup into his bedroom, keen to enjoy the fruits of his labour. 

Having situated himself comfortably upon his memory foam bed, Vincent began to shovel spoonfuls of soup into his mouth, revelling in the taste sensation that he had created. In his excitement, Vincent had forgotten to grab the TV remote from the bedside table before he settled into his eating position. Being a rather gangly creature, he decided that this did not pose a significant problem, and reached across to retrieve the remote. 

Believing the bowl to be well balanced, Vincent picked up the remote and began to reassume his original position. Only then did he feel the warm, damp sensation of the spilled tomato soup as it seeped through the fabric of his finest Sports Direct tracksuit bottoms.

But this was just the beginning of the horror. Looking down, Vincent could see that some of his precious soup had made contact with his snowy white bedsheets, and his heart filled with a cold, sharp dread. He dashed to the bathroom and returned with wet towels in hand, but the damage had already been done. 

Filled with shame and self loathing, Vincent finished his soup, and then began to change the sheets, the final spoonfuls of soup tasting like ashes in his mouth.

I agree as well that the team performed better when Lucas was brought in at DM, and you're right that Lucas distributed better. I think that illustrates my point though. Clearly Gerrard can pick a pass better than Lucas. The fact that he wasn't doing so suggests a dip in form much more than that he simply forgot how to play. 

I don't mean to say that Gerrard has been moping about, not putting in effort, sad about last May. I can see, though, how letting the league slip, clearly his last chance for his only title and storybook ending to a one-club, followed instantly by a dismal WC performance could put someone in a frame of mind where motivation is not easy to produce. 

He will never be able to press properly the way our system demands and can't defend by means of pace, but neither do Allen, Lucas, and to a certain extent, Henderson. Allen and Lucas defend positionally; Henderson does so through his engine. I'd say that Gerrard has a good enough understanding of the game to position himself well if that's his only means of a spot in the starting 11. Gerrard also has the ability to offer more than either Lucas or Allen offensively (Allen was fantastic going forward against City, but that still isn't the trend, at least not yet). 

If anything is going to motivate Gerrard to work, it will have been sitting out for 6 weeks and watching the team flourish without him. Surely he doesn't want to spend his last year at Anfield as a spectator. He absolutely has the quality to adapt to the deeper role, if that's what he wants to do. I'm honestly surprised that everyone is so adamant that he is finished. People were upset with the positive, somewhat disrespectful response to Johnson's not signing an extension.

Looking at the company web site it say nothing about being a benefit to the local community and all about how successfully the company is.

The question is are the people on the Board fit and proper persons to be managing a community asset. Can the board show they are members of the local community? Do they use the services of the Housing Association or do they profit from it?

Ask the moral questions and call into question the boards integrity.

How well has the board managed the finances. What happens when interest rates rise 300% and property prices fall 30%. Ask the awkward questions. If they don't say then ask what it is they are hiding.  

In my opinion on legal grounds you have already been sold down the river but with a large enough group you can pressurise the board to re-think.

**2.1.1** - The plate can be positioned within the longitudinal planes passing through the outer extremities of the vehicle. 

**Section 3 - Inclination**

**3.1.1** - Must be right angles to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle;

**3.1.2** - May be inclined from the vertical by no more 30° when the backing plate for the registration number faces upwards;

**3.1.3** - May be inclined by not more than 15° from the vertical when the backing plate for the registration faces downwards.

**6 - Geometric Visibility**

**6.1** - The space for the mounting the plate must be visible within a space bordered by two dihedrals; one with a horizontal edge defined by two planes passing through the upper and lower horizontal edges of the space for mounting the plate, the angles of which in relation to the horizontal are shown in Figure 1; the other with a perceptibly vertical edge defines by two planes passing through each side of the plate, the angles of which in relation to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle are shown in figure 2.

In short, you fall foul in arguably three areas, perhaps two. Your license plate (section 2) does not protrude the distance of the length of the bike, obstructed by the exhaust cans. The licence plate (sec 3) does not meet angle requirements (it is facing downwards of greater than 15° incline) and finally and most importantly (sec 6) it is not visible in an angle of 30° from both sides of the bike when standing behind it nor is it visible at 30° above or 5° below from behind.

You could argue that the plate does satisfy section 2 as it is visible on the longitudinal plane (from the rear) but it's not a strong defense.

EDIT: Not to piss on your parade or anything by the way, i was just curious as to what it would fall foul on is all! Unfortunately we don't have such relaxed plate law as America, where you can in some states just have it almost at 90° stuffed up the arse of the bike!",null,0,null,1425700607,null,0,1425701025,0,cp6z00h,null,t3_2y679b,null,t1_cp6z00h,null,t3_2y679b,null,null,null,1427623788,null,4,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,4,null

If we beat QPR, we'll be ahead of Southampton and one point behind Liverpool.  If we go on to beat United, we'll be level with them.  We'll still have to outperform both in the run-in, but they both have much tougher fixtures.  They will both lose at least two matches against top 7 clubs (not counting our match against United).  Will we?  I doubt it.  We're better than Southampton, and we might just get a nice result when City comes to the Lane.  Regardless, I don't think we'll lose both.

Everyone cites Gerrard's legs as the reason why he simply cannot play for Liverpool in this system. I think Gerrard had plenty of leg last season and don't really see why he couldn't be bothered to show that again now. 

I could easily be wrong, and everyone's attitude towards Gerrard would be warranted, but all this hate  for him is rather astounding. Either way the debate will be settled very soon. It's honestly that Gerrard doesn't deserve to be written off so quickly because of his performances; every player has a dip in form.

Ionno about you guys, but I'm thinking it's hard to be optimistic about this one. Tottenham are arguably playing better than Arsenal currently are, so this game might be even harder than Wednesday's. They're a few points off their annual 4th place challenge as well, so the incentive is definitely there for them. Meanwhile our squad is decimated. Will be interesting to see how Ramsey lines up. I'd love to see Vargas starting.

As for what I think will happen, it'll be something pretty status quo. As usual, we'll give them a good run for their money, playing better for large parts of the game. But, as is traditional, we'll fail to score our chances when they come, and ultimately end up losing 1-0 or 2-1 on some jammy goal that we didn't defend properly or something.

Check your CV for evidence of website development. What sites have you written using proper techniques and tools? I realise time is not plentiful but, in what spare time you have, you need to write these for fun if you cannot find paid gigs. It shows you can do it, more than a degree. If you can put the source on GitHub all the better. Find something you like, write a website about it. Write a discussion forum (yes they exist but fuck it, write your own to prove you can do it) to go on it and you have evidence for an employer. 

Emphasise the tech side in your CV as it sounds like you are going for development jobs.
And tailor your CV for every single application. Quality over quantity. When you go for a job the employer wants to know you want **that** job. Not just any job. I know this means pretending sometimes.

Jobs that require business *and* tech skills are rarer than those that require one or the other but they do exist. So your degree doesn't necessarily help. It may, but its usefulness is only measured against other courses, not against no degree at all.

Your skills may not age as badly as you think.

The biggest disappointment, considering the agreement that was in place, was Victor Moses. He was once one of the most promising players in the league and I was genuinely excited to see him in red. Signing him and having to play him in a certain amount of games cost us the league. He is a winger who can't run in a straight line, he gave the ball away and made Hendo have to make the tackle that got him sent off, he didn't track back quickly (due to his inability to run in a straight line) which cost us points against some lower league teams who shall remain unnamed for pain reasons. I hate that we signed Victor Moses and was genuinely joyful when we sent him back to the rentboys.

Before BR, I was apprehensive of Sami Hyypia. In that transfer window we signed another centre back in the form of Stephan Henchoz, and I was more familiar with him as a good player as we signed him from a quality Blackburn side, and my grandad rated him over Hyypia and as a kid I thought my grandad was the biggest football brain in the world. So in my mind Hyypia was to be like 3rd choice. But then I saw him play, and he was stalwart. I am really happy to say I got that wrong because Sami is a true legend. A player I thought would be a legend, however, was Joe Cole. He came with prestige, off people screaming for him to be brought back into the England team, with even Gerrard saying that ""He can do everything Messi can do.""

The rest of the pack is starting to pull away from us. 

We need Isla in place of Furlong at right-back. Sorry, but Furlong's not yet up to very high pressure games against quality strikers.

We need some kind of creativity in central mid-field, which likely means Kranjkar. Then we need some pace up front, to stretch the opposition a bit. The only issue then is solving the service to Charlie; I'd say stick Philips on the wing and get him to keep crossing into the box.

Stretch Spurs through the first half with pace, bring Zamora on in the 2nd half to receive the long-ball.

Yeah don't worry about it. Your article was perfect for your target audience I think. I wouldn't say I'm your average reader I guess. So really it depends on your audience. I do like reading long tactical analysis but at the same time, I don't normally expect it to be on WAGNH. I also don't really delve into the fanpost section very often.

As for a condensed or longer version, I think I'd always end up rambling because to me everything is important and shows some of the depths football has that most other sports don't necessarily have. I'd always end up adding things because I'm never sure of what other people have seen as well. Zonal Marking does more of an overview which I'm a fan of, but I often end up disagreeing with bits of it, although I suppose it's also always the minutiae. Which I think is always going to be a problem if you condense a lot rather than focus your article as you have.

From the reaction to your piece, most people aren't too familiar with tactical breakdowns and the article seems perfectly judged in terms of depth. It just means that because you've now made me think about more things I've gotta go and either analyse some more or find an incredibly detailed tactical blog on Chelsea so I don't have to think for myself ahaha.",null,0,null,1425721270,null,0,false,0,cp757yw,null,t3_2y1yvq,null,t1_cp757yw,null,t1_cp6cv0l,null,null,null,1427626760,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

&gt;It’s hard to see Balotelli having a future at Liverpool beyond this season. If Liverpool can find a buyer willing to pay a decent price during the summer they will let him go. I don’t buy into the idea that Balotelli is such a bad influence that he can’t be incorporated into a team but he’s yet to really fit in at Liverpool for various reasons and there’s no point keeping him if he isn’t going to play.

I really hope Balotelli turns things around (and is given a chance to). As things stand currently, he's still a misfit to our current side IMO.

&gt;

&gt;__Jeffrey Howard Archer, Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare__ (born 15 April 1940) is an English author and former politician.

&gt;Before becoming an author, Archer was a [Member of Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament) (1969–74), but resigned over a financial scandal which left him almost bankrupt.  Later, after a reversal in his fortunes from the royalties of his best-selling novels, he became deputy chairman of the [Conservative Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK\)) (1985–86) before resigning after another scandal, which would lead to the end of his career in elected office.  He was made a [life peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_peer) in 1992. His political career ended with his conviction and subsequent imprisonment (2001–03) for [perjury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury) and [perverting the course of justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverting_the_course_of_justice), which followed his second resignation. His books have sold at least 250 million copies worldwide.

* nobody is talking about 15% of our food supply disappearing. The only person here that mentions it is you, and for no discernible reason. And if you did not have reading comprehension issues, you'd also notice that I wrote that 15% is the upper limit of the percentage of our food that comes from the developing world, as per the report I linked. If you want to dispute the report's contents, I would suggest contacting its authors, rather than trying to argue with me that the figures it contains are wrong. 

* You talk vaguely and without substantiation about the EU itself importing stuff from elsewhere. I am sure that there's a degree of that at play, but you provided no reliable numbers or evidence that's the case, so, as far as I am concerned, that is a second order effect at best until such time as said evidence turns up.

* You ramble on about some vague reference about imports and exports and finish with a lapalisade. Yes, we know we import more than export, that is where we started this discussion from, but the obvious point is that if you import 1t of lettuce and export 500kg, you'll be able to import less than 1t if you export less than 500kg.

* You then (hopefully not purposefuly) choose to ignore what my sentence actually means and start again rambling about food banks and whatever. The fact is, the **global** (not just this quaint little group of islands) number of undernourished people is falling. While there might be more and more of us, we're becoming more efficient at food production and distribution. Is the trend sustainable? Opinions vary, but generally the sentiment seems to be thatt change needs to happen if we are to have a chance to feed everyone on this planet in the future.

If you believe the Daily Mail then 8/10 claimants are living the life of riley and whilst that's absurd, it's possible to live comfortably on benefits if you know the right words to say, the right way to act and even more so if you're willing to work on the side and plenty are.

I know the usual retort is ""Oh well how can you know they are lying"", but in my own personal experience people are more than willing to openly admit to it - they are proud of it.

They have just bought wrongly the last couple of years, going for older players for instant success instead of thinking about a healthy future. Which even Chelsea is considering more, they sold Mata so Oscar could have that position. 

They are limited to buy players for 50m a season + sales. But they do not really have any players worth selling. Their defence is extremely old (especially LB and RB), they need 2 good new midfielders (one replacement for Yaya Toure in the future) and well someone who can play next to Fernando/Fernandihno as they can´t play together.

---

&gt;One of Coghlan's clients, in September 1986, was [Jeffrey Archer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Archer), then the [Conservative Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK\))'s Deputy Chairman, whom she met in [Shepherd Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherd_Market), [Mayfair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayfair). Aziz Kurtha, a Pakistani  businessman, sold the story of Archer seeing a prostitute to a tabloid newspaper. On 24 October 1986, the *[News of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_of_the_World)* filmed and audiotaped Michael Stacpoole, a representative of Jeffrey Archer, giving Coghlan £2,000 in £50 notes on Platform 3 of London's [Victoria station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_station_(London\)) to leave the country to avoid reporters. Coghlan earned £6,000 from the newspapers for taking part in the [sting operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_operation). Archer admitted to giving Coghlan travel funds, but sued the bolder *Daily Star* for printing that he and Coghlan had had sex for money.

As was the chemistry between Louise and Tom despite the fact that he believed, at the time, that he could do the show just as well with a cabbage as his companion.  Some OTT acting by some supporting actors.

Sunmakers - Less clever script, but with great social commentary.  Less imaginative sets.  At least as much OTT acting.  Strike that, waaaay more OTT acting.  Good writing for Leela and one of the better resolutions to a Fourth Doctor story.

Happiness Patrol - Not one of my favorite McCoy stories, but then the only one that was really ever any good in my mind is Remembrance of the Daleks.  Not that I didn't love Sylv and Sophie, but lets face it, the scripts sucked, the producer was more a promoter than a show runner and TV (esp on Doctor Who's budget) special effects at the time couldn't come close to what the movies were doing.  The set and costume designers seemed to loose interest in being creative with what funds they had and JNT had by this point shoved the show so far up its own ass that even the diehard fans couldn't follow what was going on.  And the less said about the Candyman, the better.

That being said, it was certainly an interesting story.  I love how Seven disarm the male snipers(?) and it's still probably better than new series Who stories 9 times out of 10.

If it's that they haven't installed a ramp at the front of the building, but only at the side, because there's insufficient room at the front - that's unlikely to land them in any trouble, as they can show that they've made ""reasonable adjustments"" to facilitate the disabled. Have a look at S20 of the [Equality Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/20).  
If you're registered disabled, you actually get [additional rights](https://www.gov.uk/rights-disabled-person/police) in some circumstances with the Police.  
  
As for the businesses - are they discriminating against disabled customers, or employees - or both? And if so - how are they doing this?  
You really need to give a bit more detail, here.  
Also - note that when the Police say it isn't up to them, and you haven't said what, specifically ""it"" is - they're probably correct. They don't write the law, they just enforce parts of it.

Except no one was arguing that no one would mourn her death, so no idea why you felt the need to write it. In fact, you were saying the opposite. You were saying that even if a Republican didn't like the Queen, they'd still mourn her. Which is bollix, regardless of whether you think she's some god deity worthy of respect or not. Now, I'm sure there will maybe be some, but they'd most likely be outnumbered by the ones singing ""ding dong the witch is dead."" Unless you want to delude yourself into believing royalist servility extends into Republicanism, but really that is just delusional in the extreme. It's the equivalent of sticking your fingers in your ears and screaming ""everyone loves her, I'm not listening, she's a saint and everyone will mourn her, lalalalaa."" 

They won't. Nor should they, and nor should they feel obliged to out of some bollix royalist emotional guilt trip. That would be a dick move by a royalist to try and enforce their own agenda. Much like a Republican running up and laughing in the Royalist's mourning face that the Queen was dead would be a dick move.

null,false,nichzuoriginal,null,null,null,"fucking shit loads. You must live I a nice area if you are not surrounded by the like I am.

for a start it's not 52 quid. That's kiddy rate and just the start of the feast. there is the housing 180 a week, council tax, free school meals, free prescriptions, glasses, all the vouchers, free school. trips, subsidised uniforms/classes. of course many many have children as a career, and these children have conditions that are highly subjective but attract extra cash.

the calculation is not : do I want to be on 52 a week or 450. it is; do I want to be on minimum wage 225 a week + travel. and the reality is many will not earn more than minimum wage, they have zero qualifications and skills and it is pretty fucking sweet to do nothing all day every day in exchange for 400 a week in benefits without the hassle of getting up early, getting dressed, all those hours lost to commuting, difficulties with wraparound d childcare. and with the prevalence of aero hours one day sick and you are struggling. works dry up for a few weeks and the have all. that stress.

But benefits, that is the good life. get up when you want, do what you want, sell some shit on eBay, work cash in hand for the luxury. these people could not have this lifestyle. I work.

and don't start with : 'well then employers should pay a decent wage' because employers cannot afford to pay bog cleaners or chippy staff 26k a year. because that number is only the start. They also have employers NI, ppensions, sickness and holiday, maternity, insurance training, all relevant certs re: safety. we look at a cost of 40k for a 19k new start.

and wages will not rise when there are EE immigrants house sharing 4 to a room for minimum wage on zero hour or UTR.

it is about what option gives the better quality of life and more cars and by a county mile that is not working. by a fucking mile.

They may not have your lifestyle as a 24 year old programmer /engineer or mine as a old hand in a trade. But it is the best option for them.

and this country has fucking sold them down the river. in the buying trade we outright stopped taking on British labourers /trainees. as we could get dirt cheap poles who would work as Ltd companies for set prices for work. this was often less than minimum wage. as we had a an infinite supply we never took on any new kids, who used to be working class lads with a bit of savvy and a strong back who didn't mind a bit of graft and banter.

They would do the donkey work but pick up skills, knowledge and tickets. maybe classroom learning wasn't for them but they could bend pipes, screed, weld, what have you. We would pay for cscs, abrasive wheels, pasma. theses are expensive for a young lad and they would move up the conveyor belt.

But that all stopped when several hundred thousand EE rocked up simultaneously. many lived on site in caravans. making fast cash and going home, loaded. fucking loaded big time. we had Romanians (self employed - don't report us, all legal) mailing 3 years wages in 6 months.

it was shit. in a caravan, 12hiur days 13 on one off but it didn't last long. and we can't function like that as a society. Who will run the beavers or football clubs, we need to look after our elders parents and see our wives so they don't divorce us. read to our kids. it's not sustainable long term.

rambling now. few beers after night shift do that.

First off she applied to Oxford University (but didn't get in). Poor people simply do not go to Oxford University. She also spent a year studying in Paris ERASMUS did not exist then. It was extremely expensive to do this.

Second her time spent in Portugal.

How did she get there? This was before the age of low cost carriers only legacy carriers during that time. Only wealthy people took flights.

Her job required an RSA certificate (CELTA today). ESOL was small back then it cost more relative to incomes today. Today the CELTA (the modern RSA certificate) costs £1500. There are lots of training centres in every city which means the price is lower than 20 years ago.

ESOL in the 80s and 90s was the golden period. Several of my older friends in my biking group went to Portugal to teach English. They say it was very well paid because of the super limited supply of people willing to travel out to a wild foreign country (which Portugal was considered at the time). Talk to any older ESOLers and they'll talk about being paid a lot more in the past.

She then worked for several big organisations (read well paid) then trained to be a teacher taking the teachers' training grant and also managed to get an arts council grant as well.

1 goal keeper with fast distribution and fast reflexes.


1 full defender that does not leave half unless crucial


1 defensive mid of sorts, second role is attacking. Biggest role is breaking up play and having body strength and poke tackle ability.



1 attacker/wing player, second role is defending. Does track back depending on score.


1 full on striker always ready and in place, does not retreat unless need to protect conceding at all cost

A player like Costa doesn't work in a 5 a side match as well as they do on a full pitch. You cannot be whipping in corners and all that. Nor does someone like Willian. Azpi himself does work but I think Luis' skill is much better. Either can be picked depending on your covering defender and since that is Matic, Luis is more than enough.


Fabregas can be replaced with Oscar easily. Neither can be replaced by Cuadrado or Willian. Most of their skills require pace.


You don't need a traditional striker in a 5 a side match either. In my team you can switch Fabregas with Hazard, it doesn't matter. An Aguero like striker is perfect but Chelsea don't have one like him. What matters is the striker's skill to beat one last man and quickly dispatch a shot for which they need great skill, close control and snapshot which is why these are much better.

Eh? When did Mr. Cameron or any member of the current government say they wanted to scrap the welfare state and replace it with ""charity handouts""? Sure, they've made some attempts to curb abuse (some of which have been less-than-successful) and cut some benefits paid to working people (who, in theory at least, aren't reliant on them).

null,false,strolls,null,null,null,"&gt; They have both said that they don't trust me or my wife (for reasons TOTALLY unclear to me) not to keep the money for ourselves (which we would never do). So they want to pay it in direct. They also believe (falsely) that i can steal from a ""normal"" account in my daughter's name, but that an ISA is more secure.

I'm not saying the grandparents are right to mistrust you, but I've heard of so many cases of familial fraud and misappropriation that I don't blame them for wanting to cover all eventualities. 

Family financial disputes seem quite common, and if it was spent a a decade ago then the money may never be recovered. Whenever I read such stories, the feckless parent has no assets from which recompense could be recovered, and there's nothing to be done but jailing them.

I can find a number of such stories in the newspapers by searching now ([1](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/11327147/Mother-stole-daughters-20k-inheritance-and-secretly-spent-it.html), [2](http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/Mum-stole-disabled-daughter-s-2-6m-compensation/story-20458717-detail/story.html), [3](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-30880667)), but I suspect the cases reported to the police are the minority, and that it's more common to for young adults to accept that the money's gone and to live with a family relationship which is permanently bitter and soured.

Like I say, I'm not saying they're right to mistrust you, but if you're in financial services yourself, you must see that the ""right"" thing to do is to pay it into an account in the child's own name, preferably one which cannot be accessed by you.

I'm a bit surprised that you say child ISAs are not more secure than a regular bank account - pages at gov.uk ([1](https://www.gov.uk/junior-individual-savings-accounts/overview), [2](https://www.gov.uk/junior-individual-savings-accounts/manage-an-account)) suggest that they can be managed by parents, but the child can't withdraw from them until they're 18. I'm sure that's a strictly-enforced legal stipulation.

I would assume there'd be no such requirement for a regular bank account - I had loads of bank accounts when I was a kid, from which I was freely able to withdraw money. I can imagine a parental signature being required for some kind of ""child savers"" account, but I can imagine no kind of regular bank account prohibiting access to the saver's money for years on end.

Maybe you're right that a regular account would be just as secure as a child ISA - I'm just saying that, if so, I can see why the grandparents may be under the apprehension that it might not be.

Child ISA's were introduced specifically to replace Blair's [Child Trust Funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Trust_Fund) and it's right that they should be locked up by law so that no withdrawals until the holder comes of age.

One can easily imagine contingencies in which a parent might say ""we need to withdraw these funds, it's for the good of the child"". Surely better to withdraw a child's savings than for the family to be homeless, right? That seems exactly why child ISAs might have stronger legal protections than a regular account.

I've always been very lucky in my relationships, and I can't say I've ever had a properly acrimonious breakup. When it comes to a couple who've fallen in love, raised children and spent years together before divorcing, however, it's easy to see why they might feel betrayed or want to feel prepared against future acrimony.

I'm sorry my comment does not offer any direct answers, but perhaps after reading it your in-laws' behaviour seems a little less incomprehensible.

I could support a club that is virtually guaranteed success because they spent millions buying definite top players, but its so much more satisfying supporting a club that earns it success with hard work.

Call me qa romantic or an idealist but I far more prefer seeing our club work and fight their way up than have that bolstered by mad spending.

Equally satisfying sticking with your teams through the bad times cos that makes the good times all the sweeter. 

Moaners like this have the distinct wiff of those who have only just become fans and you'd swear they never heard the words of our club anthem that describe the very thing of struggling through the tough times:

""When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
Is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of the lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown

Walk on walk on with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone""


These are people who support the club without knowing what its about or its ethos and they should be struck from being fans if they don't get that.

Perhaps I'm being overly romantic but I love the moments where the team rises to the occasion, scores as I'm cheering right there with them and every other fan on the planet.

One of my favourite moments of the season is Coutinho sliding to the line, tongue out, nodding his head in that ""Who's your daddy"" way. 

Its great to revel in those moments but you can only revel in them when you've cursed the tough times.

There are currently 675,263 jobs listed on Universal Jobmatch, the service that the government wants people to use to find a job. There are 1.86million people unemployed, 860,000 of those are claming JSA. There are no doubt more claimants of other benefits who aren't counted in those figures as unemployment figures only count those who are actively looking for work and can start work within a fortnight. 

So even if every single person who was claiming JSA only, to say nothing of the million other unemployed, had ONE JOB on jobmatch they could do, that leaves 184,737 people with no job, who are still unemployed. 

There are not enough jobs out there to have full employment, and full employment is not an admirable goal for a government to work towards as it tends to cause high inflation. 

If you start taking away benefits, the reality is not that everyone will find a job - the reality is that those who cannot will expand an underclass, and we will have a vicious cycle of undereducated children becoming undereducated parents and contributing to the underclass. It's far better, in my eyes, to provide all families with a baseline of living so at least the children can go to school in a clean uniform with a belly full of food and a fighting chance at being able to learn something.

null,false,JLBate,null,null,null,"Cases like these are infuriating as it's very difficult to prove. I'd do the following: 

- Write down the entire incident whilst it's still fresh in your memory. This will help as you may be questioned days or weeks later and you'll probably forget some things. 

- Inform the police and provide a Statement of Complaint. In the statement, make sure you have every detail of the doorman and any witnesses. (Remember the doorman's weight, height, distinguishing marks/features/scars/gait, etc.)

- The guy can be identified from his place of work - the police are likely to perform a PNC check on the him which will potentially identify any previous offences. This won't lead to a more likely conviction - and the information may not be disclosed to you - but it could add support to your allegation. My suspicion is that the bouncer has offended before.

-  Unless they have already done so, I'd request the information to be sent to the Force Intelligence Bureau (this means that it's recorded on an intelligence form and it now becomes a jigsaw piece that could, potentially, make a bigger picture if the guy is known to the police. Again, this will be done by the police but it's something that shouldn't be overlooked) 

- Follow advice from the Police with this, but I'd immediately put in a complaint with the manager of the bar, and if a solution isn't forthcoming, then I'd go higher (the council may be able to provide you with a point of contact for the pub's management company perhaps? I don't have much experience with contacting these people, so I'd do some Googling beforehand) **Edit:** this is perhaps unprofessional of me, but I've seen successful Facebook campaigns that have been used in cases like this - you could apply pressure on the nightclub; especially if other people have been affected but haven't come forward. Take that advice with a pinch of salt, but social media is a powerful tool. 

- Money, as property, is very difficult in proving ownership (as you are aware) -- unless you have serial numbers etc. it's very hard to trace. Had you drawn the cash out from an ATM earlier that evening? Perhaps CCTV covers that area? 

I won't answer for the police at the scene, but if it was a busy night they may have had other considerations - they may have concluded, as I have, that enquiries are unlikely to catch this guy. Perhaps they should have been more professional in their manner, however that's one of those things. The bouncer has probably done it before and clearly knows the difficulty in investigating this. Remember also that you, the patron, was likely drunk, and he's sober. (Just another reason not to get too pissed - people take advantage of you) 

Unless I'm mistaken, *key* means cannabis. (I might be wrong) but common drugs in clubs are pills and cocaine, so perhaps it could mean Ketamine or something like that. Also, you were right to not kick-off, that would have made things escalate, but next time I'd make a fuss, speak loudly saying, ""I do not consent to be searched"" or words to that effect so other people start watching. Or, you could record any incident on your phone (audio or visual) -- measures like this provide an accurate and unbiased account of what's been said and could pay off next time. 

Ultimately, the Court will have a very hard time proving this one, and because it's ""only"" a few quid it will likely be chucked out. Reference your comment about being stabbed; I feel your frustration (and I know it was conjecture!) but any serious crime would be investigated fully - the courts wouldn't classify yours as serious, however. In a perfect world all crime would be treated seriously, but with the current state of the police and courts I'm surprised you managed to find 2 coppers to report it to!

This was particularly notable in the host nation Germany, the defending champions twice over, as well as in the countries of the two finalists, the USA and Japan. 
&gt;  
&gt; The four games featuring the German team all gained average audiences of more than 14 million, with their final three matches attracting averages of over 16 million viewers nationwide – by far the highest audiences on record for FIFA Women’s World Cup matches in Germany. An average audience of over 17 million people watched Germany bow out to Japan, representing nearly a quarter of the German population. 
&gt;  
&gt; To put these figures into context, an average German audience of 15.5 million watched the recent Klitschko v. Haye World Championship boxing match in Hamburg, Germany, and an average of 14.8 million watched Germany v. Serbia at the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa™. The German audiences for the FIFA Women’s World Cup are also the highest audiences for any sporting programme in the market since the final in 2010. 
&gt;  
&gt; “These are solid figures on their own, but when you put them into context with other major sports events they emphatically underline that the FIFA Women’s World Cup was an exceptionally popular spectacle for TV viewers,” said FIFA TV Director Niclas Ericson.http://www.fifa.com/newscentre/news/newsid=1477957/index.html",null,0,null,1425736181,null,0,false,0,cp786nv,null,t3_2y84ro,null,t1_cp786nv,null,t1_cp76zqr,null,null,null,1427628143,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

The incident has been recorded by the police and assigned to an officer. I have also notified the SIA (who licence the door staff) however the police also work closely so they will again pass this on to them.

I did draw the money out of a cashpoint - went into 1 pub and ordered 2 drinks via my credit card.
I entered another club and bought no drinks, I entered this club and again spent no cash, I was hardly in for a 30 mins before needing the toilet, I wasn't drunk and I did tell the door staff I don't consent searches - he forcefully searched me.

Cameras would see me withdrawing cash and cameras in other clubs would see me not spending money, but again I can't see anyone caring enough to even bother finding this footage.

The area I was in only contains a few clubs and the night was a quiet one, no trouble out front and the police were just sat in the van talking, not that they were to busy but that they did not care to investigate. I do believe if they had searched him he could be questioned as to why he had a large amount of money (considered to be) for someone at work.

I notified the management, they were quite helpful and have ID the doorman and passed this on to the police, however that was all they done.

Pepe Reina
Arbeloa-Carragher-Hyypia--Riise
Lucas
Alonso--Mascherano
Gerrard
Torres---Suarez
Manager: Rafa Benitez

Keeper: Had to be Reina for me, as a leader, fantastic keeper at his best and an alround amazing guy.

Defense: Hard to overlook Agger, but I feel Carra/Hyypia partnership is the best one and with only two CB i had to pick those. Arbeloa on the right, an alround solid back who went on and has played good for RM. Riise ive always liked and we never really replaced him until maybe now with Moreno!

Midfield was a bit tricky. I wanted a Alonso/Masch partnership with Gerrard just in front. I concidered Kuyt for a long time, but I also feel Lucas deservers a spot, so i went with him for the sake of the formation I wanted.

Forwards: I went with this formation to fit in both Suarez and Torres on top, and what a partnership that could have been. Two strikers at their best were number one in the world, and who will always have a special place in mye heart!

null,false,SoyBeanExplosion,eng-yorkshire,York/Ely,null,"&gt;Under the plans to be debated by members, Article Five of the UN Declaration of Human Rights – stating “no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” – would be extended to “all sentient life forms”. 

I like this idea. Good to see at least one party is taking a strong stance on animal rights.

&gt;Members also propose a ban on commercial horse and dog racing. 

Wholly support this. Anyone who knows how animals in these sports are treated knows how brutal it usually is. It's a cruel support that shouldn't be allowed, same as bullfighting.

&gt; The Greens believe that the money spent maintaining a nuclear deterrence should be spent on foreign aid, increasing the budget to £16 billion a year, or one per cent of GDP.

&gt;On Sunday members will debate using the money to “build one or more hospital ships to provide worldwide humanitarian aid and support”.

&gt;They will also propose the creation of Forest Schools, so that children can build their “self-esteem through hands-on learning experiences in a woodland or natural environment with trees”. 

Again, all policies I can get behind. Scrap the useless nuclear ""deterrant"" and instead spend the money helping the most needy across the planet. Also strongly support the idea of these 'forest schools' (though it might be more practical to simply enact a similar policy for existing schools?), I like the idea of children being raised with a greater appreciation of the environment, and particularly being given the chance during their youth to explore some of the wonderful places this beautiful country has to offer.

&gt;Under plans to rewrite the rules of global trade, goods would be banned from entering the UK if they are made in factories that do not comply with British health and safety standards or do not pay a living wage. 

Thumbs up to the first part though the living wage is definitely too high a standard. We have an ethical obligation to not support sweatshops.

&gt;As for those who enjoy a Saturday night flutter, members propose that “rather than creating a few millionaires, we would seek to make the lottery more progressive by dividing prize money into smaller chunks.” 

Not a huge policy but seems sound enough to me, spread the wealth around a bit more. Can do a lot more good that way!",null,0,null,1425740470,null,0,false,0,cp79itj,null,t3_2y8pt0,null,t1_cp79itj,null,t3_2y8pt0,null,null,null,1427628767,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

null,false,GnikN17,null,null,null,"I disagree. Lamela gives the ball away just outside their box where their entire defence is so they can spring out and counter. Mason gives the ball away when the team is in a more defensive shape so we have time to recover. 

Basically Mason tries high risk passes and he's no Luka Modric (who is?) so they don't always come off but they don't tend to lead to any real danger for us. We can barely pass the ball forward without Mason and his attacking mentality.

Lamela gives the ball away whilst doing fuck all but slow the game down and it always often looks like we can conceded from the breaks it causes. Look at what Chaldi does when he receives the ball on the left. He controls the ball and looks for a pass straight away. If there's not one on he runs at his fullback and keeps him guessing whether he's going left or right until last minute and then does something useful like dribble past his man or put in a decent cross. Lamela could do the same on the right if he could use his right foot and react quicker but he doesn't, he just gives it away and I'm getting so fed up him wasting possession in good positions.

I'm not having a go or anything, but I don't understand why Lamela gets so much support and patience whilst our own academy products (Bentaleb &amp; Townsend last season, Mason &amp; Townsend now) are regularly criticised harshly. I remember some were even saying Kane isn't all that great before he started scoring loads. What has Lamela done to earn more fan support then the academy boys?

His crisp passing through the lines into the offensive third is so unspectacularly efficient and clever. Masch is just a tad more one-dimensional in that way. Or, rather, he never really got to show that part of his game in a double pivot with Xabi. I agree that one might quite easily make the claim that Mascherano is an even better player than Lucas, but I'm thinking Liverpool-Mascherano here, not Barca-Mascherano, and I feel that Lucas has surpassed Liverpool-Mascherano, at least. I fucking LOVED Javier when he was here, but I guess I just have a really soft sport for Lucas, and in general prefer his style of play over Mascherano's. Have no issues with anyone preferring Masch, though.

If we're putting together a team to be the most efficient in our current formation rather than picking the ""best"" players, I definitely agree with Riise over Aurelio and Agger over Skrtel. I'd be really tempted to put Mascherano as a center back over Carra or Agger as well. With the way pace is valued in the wingback-positions as well, there might even be cases of replacing Kuyt with someone faster (Sterling? Hendo?), but i can't not have Dirk in my team at least. :P

Struggled with this for about a day, gave up, was too scared to disassemble the caliper so I ordered another complete caliper with all the bits from a company on ebay who happened to be breaking a GS with the same brakes. That came with a stroke of luck - the pads on there were only slightly used. I decided to swap out the calipers temporarily, disassemble and clean the old one (good learning experience) pop the new pads in there once it's been cleaned and fixed and then put it back on the bike. While swapping the calipers, I managed to spill brake fluid everywhere (emptying the master cylinder), and now I can't get the new caliper back on the disc. I can't move the pistons back enough again. Im waiting on brake fluid (ordered 2 days ago) but FedEx and wemoto have let me down on that one. This is how you learn, right?

Sadly it will be very difficult to secure a conviction. If you look at it from the point of view of a defence solicitor for the bouncer, all they need to do is put an element of reasonable doubt into the mind of the magistrate, which unfortunately in this case would be quite easy to do.
  
As you've identified an offender the officer should have taken a statement from you, and should now look to interview the doorman .
  
Sorry you didn't have a good experience with the officers who attended. It sounds like they could have handled it better and perhaps you should make a complaint to their inspector who can reinforce with them the idea of victim focus. I won't make excuses for them, but night time economy policing is difficult because there are so many reports of theft that go on all night that it's difficult to investigate them all there and then whilst also maintaining enough of a presence to stop violent disorder, which i hope you'll appreciate will often be more serious. Either way these officers do sound a bit lazy.

I disagree with this. Everyone talks about swing voters like they're a bunch of easily manipulable mindless idiots, but realistically they're not. Swing voters, just like the rest of us, live in the country where the Tories are currently in power so it's natural they understand more about them already. 

In my opinion TV debates serve only as a platform for lesser known or out of power parties to gain traction, not necessarily with honest policy and good debating skills either. If it does go ahead a number of the smaller parties will just be telling people what they want to hear, which the Tories will have trouble doing.

Of course he chooses what is discussed - what do you expect from a weekly hour long TV show? Most of his work is radio work.

Second half was great at the start. We pressed well, made solid passes, caught their defense out. But that Charlie Austin save off the line was too good. 

Then we just absorbed too much pressure. Thankfully we didn't concede after the Beast scored, though it could have been a penalty on Nabil.

**Pros**: Moved up to sixth, above Southampton now.

Two straight wins after a rough patch. 

Lloris is God.

Great counter-attack that, unluckily, didn't produce

**Cons**: Defense was a bit sloppy.

Can't absorb that much pressure against better teams and expect them not to convert.

It's a free country I suppose.

And secondly I only saw the edit in your first reply to me. You really show your ignorance about ADHD if you think these things are unrelated to the disorder. 

IIRC ADHD is caused by a lack of dopamine in the brain. This means people with ADHD are, in effect, in a permanent state of mental boredom, their brains under stimulated. This is the [Low-Arousal Theory] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_arousal_theory). This causes the inattention and hyperactivity seen in ADHD. This is the brain trying to stimulate itself. It can also cause a [novelty-seeking personality] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_seeking) type. This is seeking out new forms of stimulation and pleasure e.g. drugs, new sexual partners, extreme sports etc. 

This is also coupled with impulsivity. So instead of thinking about it and then turning down an offer of drugs, the person with ADHD is already away snorting a line in the toilet. Or say you're trying to improve your diet, you might eat a slice of cake before realising you're really not supposed to be eating this.

And to throw another spanner in the works there's also the nearsightedness in thinking which causes a low motivation. To work and improve at something over a long period of time is a struggle. Those with ADHD will only be motivated with immediate or in the near future consequences. Improving your diet to better your appearance or kicking an addiction take time and patience as the results are delayed and far off in the future. And if the results are delayed those with the disorder will lose motivation at the lack of immediate results and give up.

So what does that mean? Those with ADHD are constantly bored leading them to search for any and all forms of enjoyment, are impulsive and don't think before they act, and don't have the patience or motivation the better their behaviour. Not really good traits to have in a world full of opportunities to take drugs, cheat on your partner, eat unhealthily or drive dangerously. 

Of course not everyone with the disorder will be a drug addict or a cheater. It's just that they're much more likely to do become these people. 

And finally, looking back I guess this is a good example of the ""hyper-focus"" ADHD can cause lol.

I should have said above, other external factors aside ""Based on what Podpool3 has said it doesn't justify his hatred"" *given he doesn't also hate Shelvey*. Liverpoolmeg wasn't being that non-nonsensical in his question (and point), is all. I'm a mathematician- It's in my nature to think logically and seeing harmless sense being downvoted ruffled my feathers a little! (With that in mind, Reddit in general should probably give me a break down, I know.)

Player A commits offence 1, implies hatred towards him.
Player B commits offence 1, does not imply hatred towards him.
Collectively implies attitude to Player A and to Player B is independent of offence 1.

Since: Not being punished for committing an offence does not stop the offence from being committed. An aside, take this assumption or not, It's simply injustice as it should be an event independent of a player's ""A or B'ness"".

Basically I can't stand Evans *solely* for that tackle on Shelvey.


This all breaks down if you simply allow for the fact that Shelvey cannot simply be modeled as a 'Player', but as a 'Liverpool Player'.

I have an exam in 3 days. I'm sorry for procrastinating, I'm aware of holes in what I've typed out above, but I've realized it's not worth too much to try and iron it out.

TL;DR
Fuck Evans :P

I notified the nightclub and they messaged me back and said they had ID the doorman and passed this on to the police, however could not discuss this with me, which I understand.

I'm not sure they can, the officer that attended my home said, even if I as selling drugs he does not have any warranting powers to take anything from me as an officer would if they had reasonable suspicion I was doing so. Even if they could...they should not conduct searches in the toilets, it should always be done in full sight of CCTV or with others present. I could question as to why he decided to shake me down in the toilets rather than outside...he admitted he went into my pockets as he took drugs off me (allegedly).

You mentioned you went through university having or not having a degree is irrelevant not denying you weren't at university  simply proves my point. Nice try but any person can go back and read your comment on this resorting to technicalities to try and avoid this is laughable.

I think you are a prick I will admit I have been insulting you because in my opinion you are an asshole. Now you were saying you didn't hate disabled people throwing out the word ""spastic"" at someone who is disabled greatly hurts your point and is hypocritical.

Playing the victim card are we? You didn't deny anything I mentioned the comment of yours simply stated because you went through hard times and received no help means disabled people should suffer as well.

The Irish language isn't offensive, no matter how much unionist parties try and declare it offensive. Spitting at people and shouting *""Second class citizens!""* at them however... pretty objectionable.

&gt; Ultimately yes it is the British government's fault for the health crisis, but the parties here still have a responsibility to do the best with what they've got.

SF are pretty powerless when it comes to health, I mean, yes, they can argue and put the pressure on... but as the DUP runs it... if SF claimed the common cold was no threat, DUP would end up declaring it the new black death out of spite. I think NI is almost unified in wanting Neanderthals out of healthcare, but until the DUP decide to make it so, I guess there's nothing we can do.

&gt; Arguing over languages on signs and spending money to change them doesn't help matters.

It's the unionists arguing about it - it's no threat to them but they just can't stand to see something Irish prosper. Spending money on it is a bit more of a legitimate argument and yeah, I would probably hold off on it until health is sorted if I was in charge, but as the DUP don't seem to be compatible with being in charge of that whatsoever then I don't think we'll see change there for a while, at least until the Torys are out over in Britain.

&gt; And the point about SF youth wasn't about how much power they wield. Rather it was to show how the petty tribalism still lingers amongst the younger generations.

I never said tribalism would be a thing of the past, I said the unionists won't be able to brand them terrorists or say ""SF-IRA!"" yada yada in the future - Tribalism will always exist in the current Stormont set up we have.

I do not let it become an excuse for the kind of shitheaded pity-party half the yahoos in this thread want it to be. They're only interested in soothing words and validations for their laziness in dealing with their own minor issues. That was clear from the moment Pete made his post. The over-precious touchiness is laughable. I mean, get over yourself.

You work with what you have and you don't use your manageable disadvantages as a shitty cop out, or cry for pity. That culture is what sickens me and it's evidently increasing. It's all over this thread and it's fucking shameful. Sissy, self-justifying bullshit.

The amount of aspergers teens I've met, for example, who grew a little older, got into their 20s and just gave up the entire facade, comes to almost 100% of them. That's a non illness if ever there was one. Autism is a spectrum, and can be a very real illness, but socially inept, selfish assholes who use 'aspergers' as an excuse to be an anti-social, obnoxious cunt can take a run and jump. 

Depression is an illness. It can be overcome, usually by extreme mental fortitude, support and things like CBT. But fuck me if I could be arsed reading another blog from a sanctimonious attention whoring depressive. Or how it's not something you can ever get over. That is absolute defeatist bullshit of the highest order and anyone who tries to peddle that shit should be hung out to dry.

ADHD is a real illness, but not a particularly serious one. You can choose to live a decent life instead of letting it overrun you, or use it as an excuse to make up for your own basic failings in becoming an adult, or dealing with your adult responsibilities. This is life. Stop making excuses. You have it made compared to real suffering.

But none of that matters, not here. Not when even daring to point out the rank hypocrisy and unending bullshit results in mass downvoting and general ""fuck you"" from the outset. That's why I didn't even bother being civil with this arseholes. They're idiots who aren't worth the time. 

Cheers for the decent post - you're the first one that hasn't wet themselves with outrage.

null,false,to3m,null,null,null,"I dunno, man. Petrol retailing is pretty competitive (not like you can't easily price compare...), and people don't have much loyalty. The price falls come through pretty directly, but you do have to take care to look at the exchange rates.

With the proviso that these figures are a bit rough, let's compare June 2014 (£1.317/L - an average, I think - this number is from some notes) to today (£1.099/L near me):

Wholesale petrol prices: June 2014: £0.47/L (it didn't vary much); today: £0.30/L. So that implies the price difference should be £0.47-£0.30=£0.17 ex VAT, or £0.205 inc VAT. And the actual price drop was £1.317-£1.099=£0.218 - close enough? I'd say so...

You can pull these figures apart a bit more to make a stab at guessing the margin that might be in it for the retailer. So say June 2014 was £1.317/L retail. Then that's £1.317/1.2=£1.0975/L ex VAT; £1.0975-£0.5795=£0.518/L excluding duty; £0.518-£0.47=£0.048/L.

And the same for today: £1.099/1.2=£0.916/L ex VAT; £0.916-£0.5795=£0.3365/L excluding duty; £0.3365-£0.30=£0.0365/L... amazing they can afford to keep them open ;)

Of course, you might argue that the refiner is the one ripping you off, but you can check that too. Figure 170L of products come from a barrel of oil, so divide the barrel cost by 170 to get a rough estimate of how much the oil price contributes to the cost of that thing.

June 2014: ($115/bl)/($1.70/£1) = £67.50/barrel; £67.50/170L = £0.397/L; Today: ($60/bl)/($1.50/£1) = £40/barrel; £40/170L = £0.235/L.

So you'd expect a difference in the wholesale price of £0.397-£0.235=£0.162 - which is pretty close to the actual difference of £0.47-£0.30=£0.17.

I don't drive, but otherwise I expect a holiday would be nice, as would a new house.  I could easily spend £2 million on a house nearby, but having too many rooms would be crazy.  So I'd just pick a mid-range house for an eighth of that.

Once we had the new house I'd want to give myself a job so I didn't get bored.  I expect that I'd become a landlord, and would buy 10-15 houses, or flats, outright, and stick the rest of the money in index-funds/similar.  The houses would generate income, the index-funds would generate income, and there would be enough phone-calls/queries that I'd be busy enough.

A minority Tory government can definitely do confidence and supply arrangements with the Lib Dems, Ukip, and the DUP, and possibly with others, too, if they play their cards right. They may even be able to form a coalition with any of those parties (probably not all three) to make it easier on themselves, although I believe this scenario is less likely.

The scenario you appear to be suggesting - where the second- and third-largest parties form the government, is the one with no precedent, not least when you consider that the smaller of those two parties will be part of a government that it thinks shouldn't exist.

You're also making the equally unfounded assumption that the Labour party would *want* a coalition with the SNP, especially given that the SNP will be very largely to blame if we fail to win a majority. I, for one, would prefer a minority Labour government or, if the numbers add up, coalition with the Lib Dems, to coalition with the SNP. There are a great many people in the Labour party who would prefer minority government to *any* coalition. This isn't even getting on to what the general public would think about a government containing a party that wants to split the country. I doubt they'd approve.

Again: If the Conservatives are the largest party they *will* form the government, whether it lasts or not.
