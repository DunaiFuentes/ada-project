Joking aside though, I'm pleased for him. Sherwood made a comment last season that we need guys like Baker around who are part of the fabric of the club. Seems especially poignant now when we're brining in so many players from elsewhere.


He's not the best or most assured defender, but he's strong and committed and I still think has plenty of scope to improve.

I think there is potential for a 'Orange booker/Blairite/David Daviser' centrist political grouping that could be the Lib Dems. They might have the wrong leader for it but he doesn't have to last. It would provide ideological clarity to both Labour and the Lib Dems if both were clearly offering different ideas to the electorate. The Lib Dems, given they have to start again anyway, could supplant Labour in those Tory English marginals and abandon their Lab/Lib and SNP/Lib seats that they've mostly been completely destroyed in anyway. The sensible path back to seats for Lib Dems right now is entirely through the Tories anyway.

Every workplace should have policies in place for disputes amongst workers-usually called something like 'working well together' policies. She needs to find as much evidence as possible-any emails, any contemporaneous notes she might have made, and try and write a timeline of exactly what happened, how the situation arose and when she might have had discussions with other staff about him. Even if there was no record made of casual discussions, if she can remember who she spoke to, they could act as a witness in any investigation. She should also get hold of any relevant policies if she can to make sure that they are followed and the company doesn't try and ignore this. 

If she's asked to attend any meetings about the issue, she should be able to take someone with her (certainly in the public sector you are allowed to have an accompanying person). This could be her union representative or another colleague. She should also insist on seeing any minutes from any meeting to ensure that they are an accurate record of what was discussed. You are allowed to see any documentation that relates directly to you, although they can redact sections relating to others. She needs to make sure that she gets copies of all minutes.

Finally, it is worthwhile taking legal advice, especially if she's public sector. An hour spent discussing this with an objective and experienced workplace lawyer is worth it, especially if she is being penalised for something which wasn't her fault-not being able to do her overtime is directly affecting her income.

It is clear what was meant and clause 5 does trump cluae 4 like it says, but it is not drafted as clearly as it could be. Also as a side note there is no way I would accept clause 6.2!

Basically the easiest way to do this is but an actual figure in the deed - this deed covers that at 5.2.1. Language like that is good. 

The liability for rent is easy to divide up, the difficulty comes over damage. Is the guarantor liable for the correct fraction of the damage (eg a quarter of there are four of you), or the damage you cause... but then sometimes nobody will know who did the damage. Clause 5.2.2 above deals with damage and the definition of ""Relveant Proportion"" expressly excludes joint and several liability (ie there needs to be some fault). Language like that on rent could also be useful, as ""the tenants share of the rent"" doesn't really have a meaning for joint and several liability. 

For the love of God do **not** trust the letting agent to make any changes to the deed, they have no clue what they are doing or what anything means.

I wont even start with pedestrians walking into the road staring at their mobiles or running across when its a red man showing.

Do you really think that cyclists purposely put themselves in danger or do you think it may well be down to how the infrastructure is designed?

You only have to look at what an [advanced stop zone looks like](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0P5bkEYlbMQ/UGGWo_ERyYI/AAAAAAAABUg/gQPjWycBEOg/s1600/2.JPG) and then compare it to what [the blond spots on a HGV look like](http://www.portsmouthctc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DSCN1620.jpg) to realise that uk road planners and those who agree to road design specifications are fucking idiots.

Dont like cyclists going up the left? Well, [thats exactly where the infrastructure tells them to go!](https://goo.gl/maps/5jjYI).

Although the plan never truly meant to explain the Doctor's backstory 100% it did allude to the fact that the Doctor might be the reincarnation of one of the founders of Time Lord society known as the Other and that his name might be related to that origin.

Even if the Doctor isn't related to the Other it is clear that even few Gallifreyans/Time Lords even know his true name as he was always referred to as the Doctor or by his academy nickname Theta Sigma in interactions with other Gallifreyans/Time Lords.

I know there's no legal requirement for a cyclist to use a cycle path, but that doesn't make it any less frustrating when you're sat behind a cyclist. 

Other road users jumping reds doesn't make it OK for cyclists to do so. I haven't got so much of a problem with them jumping reds at ped crossing where it's clear. But you can't always tell when there are vehicles involved. 

Of course the infrastructure is poor, but you really, really, *really* shouldn't undertake a large vehicle as it's turning left. The little lane that tells cycles to do so is at a stop sign. You only go there when the vehicle at the stop light is at a stop.

&gt;Also, what makes you think construction would start now we have migrants?

Nothing in this world 'just happens'. A Government would have to commission the building of them. That said, if you have an influx in demand for housing, the prices go up, which makes it more lucrative to build. A government could incentivize this building, through tax breaks or relaxing some regulations so long as certain conditions are met.

A Government could also take it on the chin now, and just pay for the buildings itself, and offset the cost against future benefits of building a shitload of houses, of which there are many, unless your investment portfolio is dependent on consistently rising property prices of course.

http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/tv-crimes-how-scottish-football-5271308

To show 86 SPFL games a season, Sky, BT and BBC Alba pay around £15m a year and the Chinese give another half a million.

lets price the SPFL tv at £5 a month just for the hell of it.
15.5 million / 5 = three million one hundred thousand subscriptions
three million one hundred thousand subscriptions / 12 months =  258,334 people subscribing for 1 year to equal what we get from media. 
129,166 if you charge £10.

That excludes the cost of doing it,  but at the same time excludes advertising you could have after matches / half time etc.  

It'd be interesting to know who owns the rights to all the SPFL / SFA / SPL archives though.

Would they be able to do things like show Ferguson's  Aberdeen's run in Europe etc etc....

If they don't own the archive the tv station / online streaming thing would be a non starter

was about 8 in the evening and he was waiting on a meeting with someone who never ended up showing up.

Thirdly, as I've said elsewhere, he wasn't blabbering loudly.  He actually seemed to be a bit concerned that we were there and was making a concerted effort to turn his head away from us as he spoke and spoke softly.  I heard some but not all of what he said.

Or do you think I just happened to see a different English bald man with a $50,000 watch who was talking extensively on Spurs transfers but was not Daniel Levy, and I as an ignorant American was tricked into thinking it was him?

Keep in mind this was the night before I took the bar exam; the very last thing I wanted to be doing that night was staying up late on reddit replying to dozens of comments.

I actually can't recommend going abroad enough, it's an absolutely life-changing experience. Not to sound like a preachy gap-yah douche, but I did so many amazing things while I was out there - if you have the opportunity, I say definitely go for it.

Steve Henderson and Peter Kirsop are running the year abroad/industrial experience programs next year (might just be Peter, Steve is retiring) so if you're interested you should definitely have a word with them. 

I was at NTU in Singapore, and I originally went to spend 1 semester at the university and 1 semester on industrial placement, so I'd graduate with the ""...with Industrial Experience"" title. I even went to some interviews for companies (Syngenta, ICES) but I eventually realised I was having too much fun meeting and travelling with all the exchange students, so I stayed and got the Year Abroad title. Totally worth it. You can get really cheap flights and make the most of your time out there. I flew a plane in Malaysia, went caving in the Philippines, trekked through jungles in Burma... some crazy stuff. Definitely think about going to SE Asia. 

There's not a huge difference between the Year Abroad and Industrial Experience degree titles. Industrial experience comes with more practical knowledge (which you have to learn in 5th year anyway), and Year Abroad throws you a billion miles out of your comfort zone to the furthest end of the earth (if you choose) where you grow as a person and do crazy shit. So I may be a little biased, but I'd suggest the year abroad!

If you have any other questions I'm happy to talk about it, I can even give you tips for the year abroad interview if it's something you're going for.

Grid Iron have been a bit hit or miss lately, the show they did in the uni's old medical school being a definite miss, but they do still have a great track record and are always interesting.

From the Traverse I'd say [Swallow](https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/swallow) is a good shout just because of it's pedigree, Spoiling is one of the best things I've ever seen at the festival and Ciara had Blyth Duff in it (it was also pretty good). [Tomorrow](https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/tomorrow) also promises to be good but is likely to reduce me to a blubbering mess if it is any good because of the themes.

Northern Stage's programme has [Here Is the News from Over There (Over There Is the News from Here) – A Borderless Twitter Ballad Fresh from the Middle East](https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/here-is-the-news-from-over-there-over-there-is-the-news-from-here-a-borderless-twitter-ballad-fresh-from-the-middle-east) which if you can get past the War and Peace length title should be really interesting, accessible and fun.

From the International Festival it simply has to be [David Grieg's adaptation of Lanark](http://www.eif.co.uk/2015/lanark). He is simply the best Scottish playwright at present in my opinion, (Blackwatch, the Strange Undoing of Prudencia Hart etc. etc. etc.). Will be interesting to see how he tackles such an epic novel.

If you enjoy a good musical but hate the prices the Playhouse charge for everything that tours these days then check out the [Royal Conservatoire's Urinetown](https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/urinetown). They put on three shows every year, one main one and two others. The last two years I've seen the main one, Avenue Q and the Addams Family and they have been brilliant. Properly staged with amazing sets, well acted, great lighting and sound design. Always been a highlight and while I don't know Urinetown they're yet to let me down.

Finally if you're a football fan it's worth checking out [A Beggar for a Miracle: A Fan’s Life in Football](https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/beggar-for-a-miracle-a-fan-s-life-in-football) which has Ron Ferguson (writer of the Blue Brazil) and Tom Maxwell (journalist) in conversation.

The threat functions well enough. See the Cold War and North Korea.

True

&gt;If we launch at them, doesn't matter what we hit, we're fucked.

Also true but having them reduces the chances that a rational actor would actually launch one against the U.K

&gt;Its a suicide vest for the country. As soon as one nuke goes up, THEY ALL GO UP. There will be no winners in that war.

Knowing that there would be no winners is one reason why nukes won't go up.

&gt;Again, the nukes they are telling us about DO NOT EXIST anymore, do you actually think it is possible for any country to launch ANYTHING without every other country knowing INSTANTLY?

Knowing about it is one thing. What to do is another. If you cannot retaliate, then the only other option left is to surrender.

&gt;The only thing having nukes does is ensure that if there is ever a nuclear war, you will definitely be targeted, that's literally their only function at this point. (outside letting your old school chums and/or future employer siphon shit loads of money from your work place ""legally"")

Easy to say as someone who's been driving for 16 years and no longer cares about the learning to drive process and no longer has the desire to get behind the wheel by myself as quickly as possible, but a short time behind the wheel with an examiner doesn't prove you can make safe, appropriate decisions 100% of the time.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"He was a rapacious thieving corrupt oligarch who became mayor of Nizhny Novogorod, deupty prime minister and was briefly (during Russia free market phase) the pro-Western heir apparent to Boris Yeltsin. During the 1990's, him and his cronies in organised crime looted billions worth of Russian state infastructure, set up rackets and extra taxes to fund this corruption in Nizhny Novogorod (like a two-tiered tax system which still exists in parts of Russia to this day), he one of the key figures in the merger of organised crime into the Russian state machinery during the 90's. At the time the West loved him, but while he was doing this Russia was going through it's worst economic collapse since the end of the second world war, millions of people were made destitute in a short length of time, there was mass hunger and starvation. As a result by the time of his death Boris Nemtsov was a hated, marginal, figure in Russian politics. 

This is the main reason why I have doubts about Putin wanting him dead - someone like this was so marginal and despised amongst ordinary Russians for his actions in the 90's that his opinion isn't taken very seriously within Russia, and he didn't pose any kind of a threat to Putin's power. Having him killed causes more problems for Putin than it could possibly solve and gives away an opportunity to make him into a martyr figure.

I'm not saying it's impossible for Putin to get rid of him, I'm not at all naive about how ruthless Putin is, and people who critisize him certainly do have a funny habit of ending up dead, but a man like Nemtsov had so many enemies at this point in his life the list of possible suspects is probably quite long.

My only response is this; to not get too bogged down in electoralism, the ""lefts"" (a disparate group of various people who are joined in hating both capitalism and each other) response must be on both reclaiming the State insofar as is possible and as a social and intellectual movement. It needs a real recasting, a transformation of leftist thought since capitalism is so adaptable. It's a herculean task. Not many of us are even sure what it would look like and it's the present task.

That section explains the circumstances which must exist before the constable has the power to require a sample of breath.

The ""reasonable suspicion"" you see there means any articulable suspicion (that is, they must be able to put into words the reason they suspect you, and the grounds must be reasonable to an average person).  ""Suspicion"" is below ""belief"" on the scale of certainty.  Case law indicates that on a ten-point scale from a ""gut feeling"" to absolute certainty, ""reasonable suspicion"" is as low as 2/10 (the so-called ""simple test"").

Another user has given examples but the basic principle is; if a reasonable person saw you driving, would they suspect that you were drunk/had committed a moving traffic offence?  If the answer is ""yes"" then the suspicion is reasonable and the power to require a sample exists.

I have seen lay-by traps where police measure the speed of oncoming vehicles, or watch for vehicles with headlights out or similar.  They then have reasonable suspicion of a moving traffic offence, and pull the vehicle over to breath-test the driver.  Presumably this is what you're talking about.  These are perfectly legal.

&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by integration exactly?

You have no idea what integration means, yet you claim that you understand and remember '81? 

Working with a few people from different countries is an example of successful integration, but it's by no means definitive. Integration is more than sharing a harmonic work place, and while I have no doubt that your anecdotal example works well, there are plenty of instances where integration is far harder to achieve. 

*Every* migrant community has it's struggles when they relocate. Sometimes it's easily surmountable, and sometimes it's more difficult, and it can range from anything from something as trivial as the choice of food, or as serious as feeling that our most fundamental laws are of no consequence. 

My point is that slow and gentle immigration is a wonderful thing. The immigrants feel more obliged to accommodate our culture because they are clearly a minority and they don't get the opportunity to form an enclave where they live the exact same life as they did in their own country, and the Brits don't feel threatened by a massive change of lifestyle because their community has been dominated by an alien culture. 

Part of the problem in '81 *was* a fairly fucked up police force, but Brixton wasn't a truly diverse area. It resulted in two different cultures living next to each other, and I guess that's an example of what I mean about integration, or the failing of. If that can happen when we have immigration numbers of a few tens of thousands per year, do you not think it's a concern that that situation could be exacerbated when we have immigration numbers of a few hundreds of thousand a year?

&gt;If you mean integration in the sense of intermarriage then I don't think this is a real issue. Most Jews, who have been in the UK as a community for a very long time...

Many migrant communities only marry within their community. 

It's not what I meant at all, and it's an odd point to raise, and to be honest the way that you only cite Jews being guilty of this seems very odd. 

&gt;Experience would suggest that the tendency is for greater acceptance and integration as time goes on rather than less.

I completely agree, but if you want to achieve similar levels of intolerance as we had back then all you have to do is impose a foreign culture on a community, not just in the UK, but anywhere. 

&gt;Mixed race partnerships are hardly a big deal any more; when I grew up any white girl sleeping with a black man was simply labelled as a whore. 

I remember it, and you're right. 

&gt;Believe me when I say this place was truly racist in the 60s and 70s. It is much less so now but taking the UKIP stance won't help continue in the right direction.

Why have you made the assumption that I'm 12 years old? A friend excitedly phoned me in '84 and said he was going to pick me up in 10 minutes. When he arrived he told me we're going to Brixton, and despite my objections we ended up watching the riots from the sidelines. You really aren't educating me at all.

As for taking the ""UKIP stance"", I believe that that's *exactly* the right stance to take. 

We *need* immigrants for many reasons; culturally, economically, socially, all sorts of reasons, but we need them at a pace that is dictated by *us*. It's not enough for our government to say we need X amount of immigrants to make the books balance if the public wouldn't be comfortable with it. We need to create a harmonious society, but that can only happen when the amount of migrants is regulated so real integration is achieved.


To be honest, I've only just seen your flair, *""London Arab""*. Do you think one day you'll be able to discuss this without trying to cite the Jews as the most isolated community in the UK, because that's obviously complete bollocks. 

Also, do you ever see a time, given that you've been here since at least '81, that you might change your flair from *""London Arab""* to just *""Londoner""*, or will you always be determined to see the division between people?

What I hate about biking you ask? its the gear, weather and comfort. I blame my self for comfort because you can get aftermarket seats or big comfy touring bikes but the gear and weather are absolutely horrible.

I don't have to deal with traffic thankfully, I live next to a B road which takes me to my work place in half an hour and its almost empty unless its on  a weekend and full of weekend drivers/riders. But still every couple of months I'll have to meet clients away from my workplace which is a around a 100 mile or more trip. I hate waking up, putting on gear and getting on my bike at 5 in the morning when its bloody freezing. This is what appeals me most about a car, you can just sit in it in whatever clothers, turn on the heater and play some music and be on your way. 

What I plan on doing now is to trade in my mt and getting a supersport and a cheap learners car so I can get used to a steering wheel lol. Hopefully the new bike will take me out of this phase.

I most likely going to be a ""fair weather/weekend rider"" if a new bike doesn't change me mind.

&gt;I guess what I'm saying is it's quite frustrating that someone would refuse free treatment

If you've never dealt with a chronic mental illness, I can well understand the frustration. It's difficult to describe to someone who has never had to...

Here's the thing about treatment: It only works if the patient allows for it. If you try to force it, it'll fail and the patient will combat you every step of the way. Then there are those who simply aren't able to function enough to make the appointment, such as those with chronic depression. Let me tell you, the human mind when it malfunctions can take you to some seriously dark places.

And then there is the stigma. I won't for instance put down on any job application that I had treatment for depression, because I know if I do I'm more or less unemployable.

that the car driver could and should have acted differently is not being disputed by anybody on this thread

what is concerning though, is that many seem to advocate and even encourage the actions of the cyclist. 

cooperation starts with both users being aware of each other. the cyclist could easily have moved a little to the left at the point where the overtake took place but then he wouldnt have got his little video to add to his youtube collection

he then pulled along side the driver and a further confrontation took place. no matter how blinkered you are you surely realise that it takes two people for such discourse to occur

it is therefore appropriate to criticise the actions of the cyclist who effectively created this whole situation from the outset

For those in the middle east, most go through Syria, into Turkey, then the Balkans in to the Germanic region. Out of those countries: Syria, in the midst of a civil war. Turkey is hardly a liberal country, especially if you're Kurdish, or don't have any papers, and has no liking for many of the countries where these migrants are coming from. Balkans, by and large, far more xenophobic and hostile than any Western European country, so not somewhere you can expect a warm welcome as a refugee, especially if you're a Muslim.

Those from Africa travel north in various routes, until they reach the med, generally Libya, Morocco, Tunisia or Algeria. Libya may as well not have a government. Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria all have had internal struggles recently, and are no where near as safe as their nearby European neighbours, France and Spain.

1. A mobile phone camera (depending on what phone you have) probably isn't going to be good enough for the results you're after. Something where you can adjust exposure time, aperture and ISO is more suitable - buying a used dslr or bridge camera may be a good idea. I got mine for £80 and am over the moon with it. 

2. For stars, you want to go somewhere with as little light pollution as possible. Liverpool, being a massive city, is full of lights and it's gonna be hard to find somewhere you can *really* see the stars. Somewhere like Wales/the lake district is more ideal, where there is little light (can get light pollution maps on Google). But, of course, if you're wanting to travel a little, there's a risk that the sky may not be clear.

Six months ago I got my first car and I tell you what, it might be the worst car in Britain. It's constantly breaking down, nothing in it works properly (including the speedo and half the gears) and it costs me an absolute fortune to run. It *is* fun though, not in the same way that riding is, but it's still a laugh to throw that old bastard around corners. Sometimes I'll find myself wanting to go for a drive rather than take the bike, not even due to weather or anything, just because I fancy it.

What it's certainly done though, is make me appreciate the bike a lot more. Now I really know how fast it is, and how nimble, and responsive, and how great it is to not get stuck in traffic. All that stuff I'd started to take for granted I can now really enjoy after a few days of driving the car. I even quite like riding in the rain, it makes me feel like I'm being tough even though I've got a car option.

Personally I think getting an older, cheaper car is a good idea to start with for obvious, crash related reasons. You say you can afford a GTR but your insurance would be phenomenally high if you went straight for that after passing with no NCB, why throw money away? Get a cheapo car and keep the bike for a bit, see how you get on. You can always go full car and just keep the bike for trackdays later, or you might (like me) find that actually you enjoy driving the bike on the road after all, it just gets a bit stale after a while.

He doesn't watch sports, he doesn't hang out in bars... he mostly just spends time with my mom and their friends as a couple. Likes sci-fi, reads a lot, does some DIY, is actually kind of over-sensitive. He's a great dad in many ways. But I think because he's never been taught how to express negative feelings appropriately, and because he has a huuuuuge amount of repressed anger/resentment, when someone does something he perceives as wrong he just loses it trying to get them to acknowledge their wrongdoing. And even if they apologize and are clearly trying to diffuse the situation, he can't just see it in perspective and go 'Okay, no need to go do Defcon 1 - let's just drive off.' Once that kind of rage has been triggered, it's like a nuclear reactor that's gone into meltdown - there's no going back.

I've been in the car with him when someone does something to set him off, and admittedly they're being a total dick.... or have done something really dangerous that we narrowly avoided, etc. Whereas the normal person would probably go 'WHAT AN ASSHOLE!' and then drive off and move on with their life, my dad will have to drive up next to them and shout at them through the window getting into a screaming match, swearing, insulting. I once had to sit there as he had a full on screaming match with a woman who was parked in the middle of a street blocking it and a taxi driver who inserted himself into the fight... I was terrified it was going to become physical. She was making it worse and worse by goading him and insulting his masculinity for daring to ask her to move her car. It escalated so quickly, I couldn't believe it, and I couldn't understand how SHE didn't see the danger she was putting herself in... if I saw I was making someone that angry, I would back the fuck off - not because they're right, but because I don't want to provoke someone into violence! I don't understand the desire some people have to provoke provoke provoke. Roll your window up, call the cops. 

The worst part for me is that you could scream in his face 'You're scaring me, and I could get hurt if this turns violent, please stop!!!!' and he wouldn't even hear me. It's like 100% tunnel vision. I often compare this to having a vicious dog on a leash that desperately wants to attack something. You could kick it, you could scream at it, and it just wouldn't even perceive you until it was all over.

In 13/14, we lacked upfront until Adebayor was resurrected and scored a lot of goals in the second half of the season.

In 14/15, we only had Harry Kane playing, and all of our other strikers were very much out of form.

It's been a while since we were able to bring someone on when our striker couldn't produce. Last season we would bring on Soldado or Adebayor, but the thing is they didn't offer anything different to anyone else. We lack pace upfront. So I hope we get someone like Berahino or Werner.

This manifests itself from things like the rise of the SNP and the Scottish Referendum through to things like UKIP's ""blame everything on the immigrants"" stance and the current Eurotunnel issues, as well as relations with the EU. Regardless of where people stand on these things, they've become a more prominent part of everyday discussion.

The housing market has become even more ridiculous, with prices spiralling and first-time buyers pretty much screwed. Likewise, competition for higher-paying jobs has increased thanks to a whole load more people going to University for degrees of varying usefulness, meaning a lot are coming out and finding themselves in student debt and unemployable but with entitled expectations that, as graduates, they should be earning decent figures. Instead they're often finding out their degrees mean diddly squat when everyone has one.

Since Bush and Blair's invasion of Iraq, Europe has pretty much spent every Eurovision Song Contest trying to make us finish bottom to show how much everyone hates us. It doesn't help that someone decided Englebert Humperdinck and Scooch were good choices to represent us. Also, Graham Norton isn't as funny as Terry Wogan.

Some talentless oaf named James Corden rose to uberprominence and then buggered off to America. Hopefully he won't come back.

We had the Olympics which, to pretty much the shock of everyone, went pretty damned well, and appear to have actually left some kind of positive legacy.

Use of the public highways is a fundamental right of access enshrined in law for pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders. The use of vehicles can only done so under licence so technically, those 3 groups have more right of access to the roads than vehicles.

&gt;*Imagine if you asked a motorist why they constantly drove in the cycle lane and they said ""it's not illegal and it's easier for me"", I doubt you'd say ""fair enough. Continue..."".*

As Timothy_Claypole pointed out, if the cycle lane has a solid line, it is breaking the law. When it has a broken line, its only advisory.

Brendan Rodgers expects Christian Benteke to prove “a bargain” for Liverpool despite the £32.5 million it cost to sign the forward from Aston Villa.
In a robust defence of Liverpool’s decision to invest so heavily in Benteke and the Belgium striker’s ability to fit in with their playing style, Rodgers insisted the most expensive signing of his managerial career will prove a shrewd purchase.
“I think he’ll prove to be a bargain for the club, I really do,” the Liverpool manager said. “I’ve read and seen things [said] about his game, but in the short period of time he’s been in, I’ve been even more impressed.
“He’s not just a guy who you chuck the ball up to. Of course, his strength allows you to keep the ball, but he’ll really help the unpredictability of our game this season.”
**Benteke and Roberto Firmino, the £29million signing from Hoffenheim, will play in a friendly away to Swindon Town tomorrow, having been omitted from the Liverpool squad for their pre-season match against HJK Helsinki in Finland today.**
Rickie Lambert, the striker, has completed his move to West Bromwich Albion for a fee believed to be about £3 million.

null,false,AlgeriaWorblebot,null,null,null,"My story is that there were two ""societies"" on Gallifrey: the Time Lord society and the outsiders.

Because of billennia of scientific advancement, all Gallifreyans at one point had lifespans upwards of a thousand years, but after the advent of TL society the groups diverged; the outsiders scorned and were scorned by the scientific world, and their lifespans declined as they bred.

The TL society didn't breed: they set up the looms and strictly regulated their population, and so maintained their lifespan and other epigenetic traits passed on through non-DNA genetic material.

So. They're all Gallifreyans, but only those from the TL society can regenerate, only those from TL society can become TLs, and only TLs can control TARDISes.

***

The Chancellery guard are born of the looms but didn't go through the academies; they are not TLs. The Shobogans are born of the looms but have turned their backs on TL society; they are re-integrating with the outsiders. The first-gen Shobogans can regenerate but it's probably a lottery as to whether subsequent ones can.

Iris Wildthyme is an interesting case; she claims to be an outsider, from an unsanctioned House. She may have been loomed, and she can definitely regenerate, but she was denied entry to the academy and is not a TL. She does, however, own a TARDIS that she can control.

***

The Doctor has mentioned being loomed physically mature, and has also mentioned being a child. I'm going to say both.

This is partially from the idea that he's in actuality the reconstituted (along with incomplete memories) Other. The Other was born rather than loomed; he started out as an infant. It's possible that those are the memories the Doctor has of being a child, and he also remembers starting out as an adult because the Doctor himself was loomed as an adult.

The Master being shown to us as a child could be explained as not the Doctor's memory of the event (as it's unclear whether the Doctor was there at all, and even if he had been he definitely wouldn't have had that particular vantage point), but the humans' mental image of the event. Or maybe he was loomed as a child. He was from a different House; maybe they had different traditions.

***

When it comes to the events of Listen, I find problems. The TARDIS should not have been able to travel to Gallifrey's past; it should not have been able to penetrate the transduction barrier; and a child Doctor in the time of the academies doesn't fit with my Doctor narrative. Plus it's wildly unlikely Clara would have recognised that barn as the same one hundreds of years removed and in the dark.

It has been mentioned that the barn was explicitly *not* on Gallifrey, which solves part of the problem but introduces a further one of the fact that TLs did not leave Gallifrey. At all. Any TL who left Gallifrey other than for a sanctioned mission was outcast, called a renegade, and alienated from TL society. There is absolutely no way the child Doctor would have been off-planet at any point, especially not living off-planet. My solution is that the barn encounter was not a physical event, rather a dreamstate induced by the TARDIS' telepathic circuits.

Gallifreyans are the people of the planet Gallifrey and the term refers to them at any point in time. They had developed natural inclinations about the flow of time due to evolving as a race in close proximity to the untempered schism. Sort of a sixth sense. It also made subtle changes to their biology that Rassilon later used to his advantage.

At one point in their past, Rassilon cooked up an ""upgrade"" (to put it simply) that gave Gallifreyans the ability to regenerate and enhanced their sixth sense. Along with Omega they also invented time travel. 
Now that they were the ultimate badasses, Rassilon gave his race the title of ""Time Lords"" from that point on.

So, Timelords are different than classic natural Gallifreyans, but at this point most or all Gallifreyans are Time Lords so the term in synonymous. 

River Song was created through a similar process, being conceived within the time vortex and then treated with a process that gave her regeneration. However in the show they said that her special conception only started them off, it alone is not what made her a timelord. She was probably not a full timelord. While she could regenerate, she probably lacked the sixth sense about time like the real ones naturally developed.
