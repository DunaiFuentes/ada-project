I wonder if he really thinks Labour could win a majority or if he was avoiding SNP discussion.

That was a fun watch with Paxman interviewing. Audience segments seemed less worthwhile.

Points from the BBC summary:

**Cameron**

 * A Conservative government would be able to find a further Â£10bn in welfare savings, but would not specify where they would be made
 * He wanted an economy ""that does not just look good on the page""
 * When he spoke in support of fired Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, he had not known what had happened
 * He had given an ""honest answer to an honest question"" when he said he would not seek a third term as prime minister

**Miliband**

 * He spoke about the ""bruising"" leadership contest he fought against his brother David, saying the divisions were ""healing"".
 * Mr Miliband also said Labour had been ""wrong"" in the way it regulated the banks, and apologised.
 * He pledged to tackle the ""cost of living crisis"" and to ""save the NHS"" and said leaving the EU would be ""a disaster for our country"".
 * Wealth creation was and important part of ""building an more prosperous society and a fairer society"", he said.",null,0,null,1427409545,null,0,false,0,cprwka0,null,t3_30feb9,null,t1_cprwka0,null,t3_30feb9,null,null,null,1432034224,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

She's a very headstrong and bold person, no doubt she has delivered many a bollocking to respective PMs over the years.

&gt; The Economist cites critics of Krugman stating that ""his relentless partisanship is getting in the way of his argument"". In addition, a website (titled ""Lying in Ponds"") that tracks partisanship among public intellectuals rated Krugman second in the overall partisan slant of his columns, behind only Ann Coulter.[31] As Richard Posner and economist Mark J. Perry note, the site, which uses careful statistical analysis to make assessments political partisanship, has ranked Paul Krugman the number 1 or number 2 most biased every single year from 2002-2008.[32][33]

&gt; The Economist magazine supported the finding, noting the vast majority of Krugman's columns feature attacks on Republicans and almost none criticize Democrats, making him ""a sort of ivory-tower folk-hero of the American leftâa thinking person's Michael Moore"" and that ""a glance through his past columns reveals a growing tendency to attribute all the world's ills to George Bush.""[31] And speaking on Krugman's recent ""prophecy of doom"" regarding the 2010 election, the magazine calls it a ""baseless partisan freakout.""

But apparently that was a level of complexity too high for the British public, so discussing the role of the financial crisis was ""not answering the question"" of if Labour spending was too high.

He was similarly bad with Cameron, when he was insisting on that ""Could you live on a zero hour contract?"" question, which was pretty politically irrelevant. Cameron was completely justified in trying to answer the underlying political issue of if zero-hour contracts are acceptable.

Fair point, I wasn't comparing apples with apples there. That said it was one of the earliest advance fares I could find on that route and is still cheaper than equivalent fares in this country.

&gt; One of the things we're talking about is the 'un-planned' kind of travel. I can often on a week day grab a C182, with 30 mins of weather brief, pre-flight and paperwork I'm off.

Does aviation offer that kind of flexibility all the time? Genuine question, I'm amazed it's that easy if you're a PPL.

&gt; Comparing it with a car is for that same reason, the flexibility, as I said, you can get singles that are Â£30. First often for less than Â£50 (sometimes doing the Â£20 upgrade on a weekend etc).

Yeah cars will always be more flexible, agreed. The cheap weekend upgrade offers are a good idea on the trains though.

&gt; Also let's not get confused about privatisation, it wasn't all sunshine lollypops and cheap fairs before

Single fares have rocketed in price but it wasn't really surprising that season tickets haven't increased at the same rate (eg 150%). Barry Doe really knows his stuff on train ticketing and fares though.

&gt; Also, the investment has been significant, and working practices are different. The TGV is a more efficient rail. We've issues with the gauge we use, that goes back to cost cutting in the Victorian era, we can't have the same double decker trains, this means it costs us more.

I know that. But if we're building HS2 it will be to common standards, as defined by the EU, that would allow us to run double-decker trains.

Answer: In general, Labour spending was sustainable and under control, with the lowest decifits as a proportion of GDP in decades. Labour did not spend too much until the financial crisis hit, at which point spending increased and tax revenues fell due to a global recession. Tory deficits were similarly high during the height of the recession.

Kay Burley from 'do you eat your three shredded wheat a day' to 'that's a politicians answer' and repeated comments about Miliband's family.

Then, it went a bit too far, and gave Miliband a chance to come back strongly. It was a really excellent finish. He actually landed two or three blows on Paxman, which you don't expect at all.

Cameron was more smooth, statesmanlike, maybe a bit corporate. No gaffes, well constructed answers. I thought the point by point substance of his answers was a bit better than Miliband's, given the hands dealt to them, especially during the audience section.

Obviously we're in a worse position when it comes to striker depth when compared to those clubs, but we should be adding quality strikers to the team not selling the only one we've got. 

Rodgers will look at the situation, knowing that he has a player who has one of the best goal-game ratios in the top European leagues and understand we need a striker to play alongside him, or replace him when hes injured.

I think one distinction that can be made between *Breaking Bad* and *Better Call Saul* is that Breaking Bad was more a leap into the unknown. With Better Call Saul we already know the fate of the two most interesting characters (Saul and Mike), the story is how they get there. With Breaking Bad on the other hand, though I suppose we broadly knew the path that Walter was heading towards, it perhaps had more room for surprise.

I also personally feel that the story of Breaking Bad was more intriguing, whereas seeing Saul represent the elderly in a class action lawsuit (or even seeing him use illegal means to steal money from a house to help someone he cares for get her clients back) is not so captivating. I feel that Better Call Saul started with a bang - with the appearance of Tuco - and then drifted from that immediate excitement a little too much.

I don't mean to be overly critical of the show because I really am enjoying *Better Call Saul*.

As I said though she made a lot of people rich which was basically the precursor to the banking crisis and the inequality gap we see today. You could say we stopped being world leaders in manufacturing and heavy industry and turned into a nation of gamblers under Thatcher.

The shuttle is nice, and the walk from Central campus to King's Buildings isn't bad at all (~35 minutes). I live in self-catered uni accommodation and it's OK. Having a house office to accept your packages is a huge boon. Huge! :P

There are a lot of events on throughout the year put on by the school, and your program will have some as well. You'll get out of the experience what you put in, of course. For info about the city, or things to do there are loads of posts in this subreddit, have a search, and give the sidebar a perusal. I found it very helpful.

It's an expensive city because, well, it's a city. If you're coming in on a Tier 4 visa, you will likely be able to work upwards of 20 hours a week, but you really gotta buckle down a lock in a job so you can explore the country and continent as much as possible. Again, squeeze a lot out of your time here.

Grad school is expensive generally wherever you go, and the ones here are one year, which was appealing to me. It's getting to be pretty busy this time of year, so if your time management isn't great or you don't start assessments right off, you're going to have a rough time. 

Transport from the airport to your accommodation can be daunting if you haven't been here before. I wound up paying for a taxi because I didn't sleep well on the overnight flight over. Your other options are the bus or tram, both of which drop you into the city center. Make sure you have a copy of your letter of acceptance before you fly over! Border Control will want to see it.

With Better Call Saul on the other hand we know where that path leads. We don't know everything of course but we know he is going to become the Saul we see in Breaking Bad. We know that he and Mike (the two most interesting characters) are going to survive. To me this gives the show less tension, which I think is what makes me not mind the pace of Breaking Bad.

I suppose I feel that Better Call Saul opened with a bang (with Tuco) and then took too much of a step back from that.

&gt;Abortion laws in NI and ROI as well as increasing restrictions on accessing them in some US states

You understand that abortion **isn't a feminist issue**, right? 

While I support full rights for contraception and abortion, even for late term abortions, I still understand that the **religious right** pushing for anti-abortion laws aren't doing so because they want to ""keep the womyn down"".

They are doing so because they are ignorant, idiotic and **genuinely believe that abortion is murder**. The fight is to convince people that it's not and the dangers involved in trying to prevent. Rallying on the claim ""women have the right to an abortion"" makes about as much sense to changing their views as ""women have a right to murder"".

Circumcision should be banned as it's no different than other forms of female genital mutilation. But I don't go thinking the Jews, Muslims, right wing anti-masturbation lunatics that started the trend and pseudoscience doctors genuinely hate men by advocating it. I understand they are doing it because they are ignorant and moronically believe they are doing the right thing.

So no, abortion has nothing to do with feminism and people have been advocating for it long before and will be doing so long after.

&gt;Shaming of rape-victims

Which feminists have made damn clear is anyone questioning a rape claim with no evidence. But this isn't a widespread, gendered or relevant issue. And if anything, feminism has made sure of the opposite with their ridiculous activism.

&gt;lad culture

Strange then that feminism isn't targeted at lower income populations but middle class men instead. And it's pretty hilarious you think women aren't doing the same thing in those sub cultures. You know, laddettes.

&gt;Cat-calling

So again, a non-gendered issue that isn't widespread (as feminists keep ironically unintentionally showing us with their 10 Hours Walking videos).

&gt;groping

A non-gendered issue that isn't widespread and is already illegal and overwhelminging vilified.

&gt;slut-shaming

So when are feminists going to be attacking women, the overwhelming amount of people who attack other women for being ""slurs"", again?

This is the problem, though. The EAW couldn't have been included in the vote. The only way the Government could have had any sort of binding vote on the EAW would have been if they'd introduced secondary legislation that would have had the effect of withdrawing the UK from the EAW (moving all other EAW countries to a different list under the Extradition Act), and then argued against its own legislation.

Which is why the legislation they put forward contained what it did. People who were following the whole criminal justice opt-in procedure were a bit annoyed with all the fuss kicked up over this as this should have been clear to anyone who knew what they were doing. The legislation in question had been published weeks earlier, clearly not including the EAW, and anyone who understood the workings of Parliament, and the situation with the EAW, should have known that the Government wasn't going to put forward legislation relating to the EAW (as there was no legislation to pass).

But because Cameron made a stupid promise (promising a vote on the EAW, not on the criminal justice measures or whatever), and apparently no Conservative back-bencher, including Rees-Mogg by his own admission, bothered to read the legislation until the day of the vote (relying on whatever the whips had sent around), it became a huge farce.",null,0,null,1427424227,null,0,false,0,cps52q1,null,t3_30dbfh,null,t1_cps52q1,null,t1_cps1s5q,null,null,null,1432038246,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Are all stamps illegal?  Even accidental? 

It seems so bizarre that something is so serious in one sport, like stop the presses, the media focuses on it for days, this guy needs to be suspended RIGHT NOW, serious.  When stamps are a part of the game in American Football.  I mean, an intentional stamp would no doubt get punished, this has happened before (look up Ndamukong Suh, who ironically grew up playing soccer), but accidental stamps happen all the time and they aren't treated like the player was trying to murder someone.  They all get forgotten.  

All I can really say, is that to me, it looked like an accident.  In the age of replay, where you can slow things down, it's easy to analyze every frame for intent.  What's forgotten is that Skrtel and De Gea can both cover 10 yards in a little over a second.  In real time, the whole thing happened in literally a blink of an eye.  

We judge it, and hand out punishment, based on slowing down an almost imperceptibly small amount of time.  It's one thing to stamp on someone after the ball is gone and the play on it is over.  Like Gerrard taking out his frustrations.  It's another to stamp on someone when you're both going full speed at each other.  

Also, does it actually state in the rulebook somewhere specific rules and punishments for stamping?  Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place, but I can't find anything that addresses stamping.  If that's the case then ""rules are rules"" doesn't really apply, that means these ""rules"" are open to interpretation.

If not, think about the skills that you have acquired through your education/past experience and see how they relate to the area you've decided to focus on. Once you've done that and got that clear, you could start really homing in on entry-level opportunities in the field (using all the normal job sites - I've found reed to be the best but it's a matter of personal opinion) or applying for jobs outside your desired industry that do, in some way, share the skills you need for your ideal job.

You'll be more determined in the long run. If looking to start a career in a field that you really want to work in, don't be afraid of looking to relocate - it could be really worthwhile.

As far as apprenticeships are concerned, I do not think you should consider it. Apprenticeships, be they school-leaver or higher apprenticeships (for sixth form leavers), are not designed for graduates. You have already completed your education and therefore it seems a kind of backward step. Work with what you have. You have an upper second class degree and, regardless of subject, it is still a very desirable qualification because of transferrable skills etc. More often than not it's those things that recruitment managers zoom in on in CVs and covering letters. 

You'll probably know basically everything I've said, but I do hope it helps in some way! I wish you the best of luck in what you decide to do!

So it is baffling that the Tories felt there is bias against them that they felt the need to sneak this through. Maybe someone who is more familiar with this could shed some light on it for me.

null,false,swug3,,Right Wing Conservative,null,"&gt; I think the problem is that we're not starting the discussion at the same point. I'm not advocating for a Presidential system, where executive power lies with that person, rather that an elected President would take over the ceremonial role of Head of State (the current role of the Queen).

All you would be doing is moving the problems in the name of ""democracy"". Having an elected head of state doesn't mean that they are accountable to the people, it means that they are accountable to the majority of the people.

All an elected head of state needs is realistically 55% of the population to vote for them. That isn't a fair system.

&gt; But through being elected, there would be more transparency. An example would be Germany. They have a President who has a very ceremonial role, the Chancellor, Angela Merkel, derives her power from their Federal Legislature, the same as our PM.

The PM still wouldn't be accountable, she gets her power from being elected by the majority of the people (in which she/he is elected by our elected representatives), again she isn't representing all the people's views. Which is again unfair to the rest of the population. 

&gt; Do you see where I'm coming from?

I understand where you are coming from, I just feel you have an idealised view on democracy. Having a German like system doesn't sort out problems. It just creates new ones. No democracy is perfect, and the British one isn't broken. In fact. Having an unelected head of state is a good thing. They aren't influenced by party politics, they are accountable to the people, they derive their powers from the unofficial nod that the commoners give them. Its a sort of paradox that works.

&gt; I agree that there would need to be codification of the constitution and that could be a long drawn out process, but worth it in the long run.

A codified constitution isn't worth it in the long run, as society changes very quickly, and if we don't have a constitution that can catch up, then we are stumped.

Look at the right to bear arms in America, that is some serious legal business going on.

As I stated above. The view that removing the monarchy will make British leaders more accountable is a romantic view. They will still be lobbied by different sections of society, elected officials will still have to tow some sort of party line. Monarchs don't, they can, and generally do, do things that would be in line with what the people would want. 

Which I feel is a lot fairer, you stop a tyranny of a majority, you would stop anyone from becoming to powerful. You would ensure that if anything does go wrong, you have a fall back plan which would be able to rule effectively without having everyone trying to lobby them or influence their views, until a Government can be formed.

All democracies are broken, that's how democracies work. Each broken democracy suits different nations. Trying to implant a system, alien to those people is a idealistic view which will only lead to social segregation, between monarchists and republicans, which never goes down to well.

You're seriously advocating the idea that making peace with the Nazis would have been the right thing to do?  Tell that to the millions of people the Nazi's saw as subhuman.  Not to mention in the long term leaving the Nazis alone would not have worked.  Hitler only saw the British Empire as an expedient ally against France and Communist Russia and there was still serious underlying anti-British feeling regarding the Treaty of Versailles in Germany.

Beyond that we are talking about the guy (Mosley) who married an ardent supporter of the Nazis (Diana Mitford) in Joseph Goebbel's house with Hitler as a guest.  I'd find anything he said to be highly suspect of self censorship for political means.  

Some other quotes that Mosley said openly:

&gt;It should not be necessary to secure British racial purity by act of law. It should only be necessary by education and propaganda to teach the British what racial mixtures are bad. If a Briton understands that some action is bad for his race he will not do it. With the British this is a matter for the teacher rather than the legislator, but if legislation was ever necessary to preserve the race, Fascism would not hesitate to introduce it.

&gt;The Jews have deliberately maintained themselves as a foreign community in Britain, setting their racial interests above the national interest. As such, therefore, they will be treated, and none can complain of treatment which accords with their own actions. We do not permit foreigners to be M.P.'s or officials, or afforded the full rights of British citizenship, and Jews will not be afforded these privileges. 

This is not at all dissimilar to the ideas that Hitler was pushing before he became Chancellor.  This sort of ""thin end of the wedge"" talk is right out of the Nazi playbook.

I mean, neither do I, but I have been persuaded to try and see things from other people's perspective.

There are probably people in this subreddit who were born in the UK, who have been spat on, beaten up, called names or refused jobs because they're ""not native"" enough.

Racism is real, and it happens in a myriad of ways, many of which I can't even guess at, never mind describe. 

Considering that, maybe using skin colour as a measure of someone's ""indigenousness"" - telling people they're not ""indigenous"" enough - sounds like just another way to make them feel shitty and excluded.

When people defend stuff like this, they tend to say things like ""that's the meaning of the word"" (which I think is open to debate, anyway), but you're stripping that of the context that Longfoot was claiming that these little kids shouldn't be in the paper, ""pushing their agenda"", because of the colour of their skin.

There are just some words, and ways of behaving, that are so easy to abandon, that I don't understand why it's so important whether or not they meet a pocket dictionary definition of ""racist"".

It takes absolutely no effort whatsoever to say ""oh, yes, I see how that might make people feel like you're being a cunt to them"".

Five years ago, I would absolutely have been one of the blokes (there are a number in this subreddit these days) arguing that the right to be a cunt to people is more important than being considerate when it race issues, but in hindsight it seems a supremely pointless and worthless position to take.

Having nearly finished this comment, I thought to take a look at your comment history, to see if there was a word I could find and say ""look! see you don't like being called that, but I don't call you it, because I'm not a cunt"". Maybe there's something about your Irish ancestry, or videogamers sometimes get annoyed about the way they're portrayed in the media - Longfoot certainly gets unreasonably outraged about certain things - and it would have completed one of my earlier paragraphs to say ""well, I could argue that it's technically correct, in my dictionary, to say this thing that bothers you, but I don't argue that, because I'm not a cunt"".

That's why I noticed another comment of yours, arguing that ""slope"" is not such a bad word - you would absolutely not be saying that if it was your kid or your girlfriend who'd been bullied throughout school, called a ""gook"" and a ""slope"" just because her mum was filipino, and had the audacity to come here and work as a nurse.

None of this I say you blame you or finger-point - this comment has turned out a bit longer than I intended, but I just tried to reply sincerely to your statement ""I don't understand why that's so bad"".

There are places up north they hate her for decimating the coal and steel industries, whilst personally I hate her for selling off the council houses, as I believe that's a direct contributor to the current housing crisis. 

Myself, I don't see how loss-making mines were sustainable, but it's clear that, instead of help with retraining or subsidising other opportunities, Thatcher felt striking miners deserved to be punished for their resistance.

Meanwhile, on Thatcher's watch cops collaborated with the construction industry blacklist, which saw innocent men lose their livelihoods merely for pointing out health and safety concerns, and the whole Hillsborough thing.

She's held as an icon by many tories, who attribute entirely to her the economic boom of the 80's, but I believe she's considerably overrated, and a wholly nasty person. She's been reported, posthumously, to have made belittling comments about the poor, and that's not to mention Section 28. 

Someone else has reported that Thatcher's greatest triumph was New Labour - I usually phrase this as that she changed our political narrative, but wealth inequality has risen steadily since she was elected, and that was something she was actually proud of.

She may not have said directly, but it's clear she was happy to sacrifice the poorest in our society, if it was offset by a larger benefit to those at the top - in her ideology it's only your own fault if you're not successful.

We then made more of an effort to supply quality over quantity and with josh and myself then being fully employed our time to get wider coverage lessened. We are not going to disappear but like paddy says we simply need more people to step up. 

Uni ulti is hard to cover and we try to use the systems in place to get previews but students have to study primarily. Club is easier for us but we still need people to write.

playing 7 a side and we get a free kick in the last 2 minutes of the game and we really need to score. Usually whoever is nearest takes the set piece but my team mate has taken the last 3 and not done much with them. so as he's lined up I run past, I pat him on the back of the head (in a friendly hey mate i got this way - like footballers do) and take it quickly and get the game going catching them by surprise.

the ball goes off for a corner and as im walking back the guy who was going to take the free kick is looking at me and pointing to the corner and repeatedly saying 'go take it' 'have another go' 'you sure you don't want it' again and again and again. He doesn't stop saying it and i don't know what he wants so I walk up to him and go to put my arm on his back to ask him what's up and then hits me aggressively in the chest, gives me an angry look and then sort of squares up to me

he said i hit him hard in the head and then disrespected him by taking the freekick. my initial reaction when he hit me and squared up was to punch him as hard as i could in the mouth because this was the first i knew that there was an issue. I was more shocked than anything but I kept my head and tried to defuse the situation so i calmly apologised in front of him and everyone and the team walked us different ways, i played it off as a heat of the moment thing. Full time was called and i walked over to him again on his own and apologised again but he sort of fobbed me off and said something like 'maybe because im older its not something i would do, whatever', didn't look at me and shrugged his shoulders.

I genuinely didn't mean to offend him or hurt him which is why i apologised straight away and then again because were team mates and been friends for 3 years - he clearly felt i offended him and i can see how what i did might have done that but where i get annoyed is instead of him pulling me to the side and saying 'hey mate you hit me a little hard' or 'you shouldn't have done that, i don't like that sort of thing' like friends should do, he lost his cool and hit me and then squared up to me infront of everyone. 

How the fuck did he expect me to react by reacting the way he did? yes you can be annoyed but this isn't something you start throwing punches over. even though my actions initiated it i dont feel like the bad guy",null,0,null,1427445019,null,0,1427445346,0,cpsccfm,null,t3_30g6c5,null,t1_cpsccfm,null,t3_30g6c5,null,null,null,1432041742,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

&gt;Essex, Sussex and Wessex, as you suggested, are named from the Old English Äastseaxe (""East Saxons""), SÅ«Ã¾sÄaxe (""South Saxons"") andÂ  Westseaxna (""West Saxons"") respectively. Mercia would be the most likely candidate for your ""Norsex"". This is the region now known as ""the Midlands"" and the name is from the Old English Mierce or Myrce, meaning ""border people"".

&gt;The name of Northumbria reflects the approximate southern limit to the kingdom's territory, the Humber Estuary.

&gt;Kent was originally called Cantia, derived from the Brythonic word Cantus meaning ""rim"" or ""border"". This describes the eastern part of the current county area as a coastal district.

null,false,staptiudupe,null,null,null,"Well to me it sounds like you're against democracy then (at least to some degree, as you state that democracies are broken), so what do you propose? I mean, it sounds like you're in favour of some form of reform, so what would that be? Please correct me if I'm wrong. 

I agree, you need to have safeguards to protect against tyranny anyway, regardless of what kind of system you have. So I don't see how having an unelected head of state who has no way of being lobbied or replaced by the public is better than one who is. Again, the whole thing about the letters that Charles is sending out goes against the following thing that you say

&gt; As I stated above. The view that removing the monarchy will make British leaders more accountable is a romantic view. They will still be lobbied by different sections of society, elected officials will still have to tow some sort of party line. Monarchs don't, they can, and generally do, do things that would be in line with what the people would want.

I don't want to have a King who lobbies the health minister for Homeopathy, and having no ability to remove him from a position of power. I think that is ridiculous in the 21st century. The elected HoS would have a totally ceremonial role, with no other real power, not even to influence. Look at Germany, what has their President done recently to influence the policy process? What about in Greece? etc.

I also disagree on the following point

&gt; Trying to implant a system, alien to those people is a idealistic view which will only lead to social segregation, between monarchists and republicans, which never goes down to well.

I'm not advocating the violent removal of the monarchy, just what I believe would be the best situation, in the long run, I don't see there being an English Civil War on the basis of the Monarchy. I do think that King Charles (if he keeps that name) will probably weaken popular support for the Monarchy, possibly even more so when we know the contents of the letters that he has written. We already have division in our country based on class, how would this be any different? 

I would agree that there would need to be careful thought put into a written constitution, but again, you're comparing the right to bear arms from a constitution written in the 18th century, yes, things need to be thought out, but I don't think we'd be left with something like that. In my opinion, a written constitution would be better than simply relying on norms and practices. I mean look at the whole situation with the speaker yesterday. Again, the manner in which that would be done would be tricky, to put it mildly. 

I hope that my points make some sense and look forward to your reply.

Certainly the group has stated that it's primary concerns are commodity prices, and although fuel has recently dipped, it remains uncertain.

LB MD stated that future investment is the reason for the rise in fares (which lets face it is quite a modest increase when weighed against the south of England)

The Scotsman gives the reason has the Scottish Government cutting investment in concessionary fares.

This is a white person masquerading as a black person, which at best is an act of cultural appropriation, and at worst an act of overt racism, although perhaps acceptable in 1920's white culture.

So here we've got an entire conference of people imitating the moves of someone who was promoting racial stereotypes as entertainment in order to not offend, while possibly offending deaf people by selectively using their sign language, but was the rest of the conference signed for the benefit of the deaf?

If I see a white guy wearing dreadlocks and talking in a Jamaican accent I don't think he's evil. 

I understand the argument. In principle I agree with it. If you were an oppressed group and the hardships have helped you build a culture and community, someone outside of it emulating it might feel a little like appropriation. 

It's also a good thing. It means characteristics associated with that culture are now desirable. It helps bring communities together. 

&gt;The idea of cultural appropriation is that by taking an important aspect of an culture's identity and trivialising it

It's a solid point but not sure what we do with that information. We can't ban it obviously. I don't even mind discussion about the idea because that could have a positive impact. 

&gt;I think this is actually a fair argument, especially when you see Americans wearing Native American headdresses to football games; but obviously the problem is where do you stop, can white people listen to hip-hop, eat Indian food, do algebra? 

There is also a problem with how to deal with it. Which I think is the worst problem. At the moment it seems to be a weird group think thing. People who disagree are made out to be oppressive monsters who are directly to blame for subjugating people.

null,false,dwair,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,null,"&gt; How was it then

Its quite a while ago now but I will try and paint a picture of what it was like for me.  Obviously other peoples experience will differ.

I left school in 1984, half way through my A levels as I was bored of education and wanted to do something else for a bit before going to university.  It was the height of the miners strike and nightly the news was full of picket line battles with the police and people queuing at makeshift soup kitchens in really grim looking towns up north.  Thatcher had just started her second term the year before and policies were taking hold.  

Unemployment was over 3 million, Interest rates were going mental above 10%-12% and inflation was very high.  Like most people my age I signed on and got the dole / housing benefit which was enough to live on provided you didn't mind living in a real shit hole (no central heating, damp, dilapidated ect) There was no work about about but the Job Center were kinda realistic about this and left you alone provided you turned up once a fortnight to sign on.  

Some time in the spring of '85 I got forced to work for the ""Manpower Services Commission"" which was a kind of ""work for your dole"" set up. I got an extra Â£10 a week for spending 35 hours a week digging holes by hand for the council.  Obviously if I didn't do this, I would get my benefits stopped.  I can remember spending a week filling in a trench in a field that later on I found out that another shift had dung out some months previously.  Very much false job creation to get unemployment down. 

On the News, industry was closing left right and center and the only people in the country that seemed to be making money were asset strippers - companies that bought other companies  and sold them off piece by piece. Socially, the SPG were still rocking up in vans round London and beating people (mainly black) up at random.  Eventually the police shot a woman in Brixton, it all came to a head and rioting started. 

By this time it was just about impossible to get council housing due to ""Right to Buy"" and the councils basically not having many houses left.  Homelessness was starting to become a problem and private rents were rising.

adjective: sustainable

    1.
    able to be maintained at a certain rate or level.
    ""sustainable economic growth""
        conserving an ecological balance by avoiding depletion of natural resources.
        ""our fundamental commitment to sustainable development""
    2.
    able to be upheld or defended.

Please note that it doesn't say ""only if the global financial crisis didn't happen"". If your spending or actions are ""sustainable"" only until something happens THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY SUSTAINABLE.

Now I'm not saying that the global crisis could have been predicted but something bad was going to happen sooner or later. Things things invariably do no matter that Brown claimed to have eliminated ""boom and bust"" even a cursory glance at history should have screamed ""bollocks"". 

What Brown/Labour did was create a situtation that was actually wholly unsustainable. Hence why things went wrong and the government deficit shot up.

There's also Freesat from Sky, which is entirely Sky's and is a much worse system because you can't record TV, minimal catch up facilities and it's basically a way for Sky to try to advertise their pay TV service and get their box into your home so you might just do that.

Not all Freeview channels are on either of the two Freesats. Dave and the other UKTV channels aren't, for example. In an ideal world someone would make a box that took an aerial and satellite feed and used the best of both

Not quite as simple as you think. Remember politically Britain became a union of governments when the Scots and English parliaments joined together.  It can, and would have been argued that when the UK membership was accepted then that included the independent Scottish government which had signed up through membership of the union. Everything signed up to and opted out of so far has been signed up by representatives of the old Scottish and English parliaments in a union of governments. In any case whether they could expel Scotland is redundant, the EU is clearly expansionist and simply would not lose a well off nation.

On NATO, you have already agreed that it simply can't function without Scottish waters. I'm not sure what else needs to be said to convince you that access to those waters means that Scotland would not be expelled for even one day. 

&gt;If you want Trident out of your waters fine, but you pay.

That is quite simply an absurd position to take. R/UK could not force an independent Scotland to pay for this anymore than they could force any other independent country. An analogy might be if Westminster ever wanted the US to remove its UK airbases. Can you imagine the US saying no not until you pay for us to go? The idea then that the US could in effect operate an occupying military force within the UK depite being told to go? Then it has a referendum on it, and its people decide that yes the UK should pay for the movement of US equipment so we are occupying these bases militarily until you do? Its just an absurd idea. 

&gt;how are you going to pay for the your version of the NHS, Free state education, Armed forces, Everything really with less money.

Scotland already pays for all of these things. Scotland already supports itself in taxation and spend. Yes it operates a deficit, but so does the UK. Even the Better Together campaign admitted that  an independent Scotland is financially viable. The question thereafter was on spending priority. The myth that r/UK supports Scotland is just that, a myth. 

&gt;Neither is France and look how well that is turning out for them.

Seriously? Do you think that France is struggling as an independent nation? Do you think that they are clamouring to pay taxes to Westminster and have them make their ""big"" decisions? 

The Scottish government did not want independence lite, however in a political campaign words have to be chosen carefully. Interestingly Devo-Max would have swept the boards, but Westminster wouldn't allow the option. By doing so they have set Scotland onto an inevitable route to independence, unless they about face on that one.

As well as the rise and destruction of 'free festival' hippy culture, wealthy aristocrats fighting in woodlands...

I was reminded of that just because it's the book that really taught me to visualise a pre-modern England, and it's fascinating to see on your map that the most important 'highways' are the great rivers.

To carry on from the above, why can't workers simply hold shares in their current company? Making that easier (maybe with tax benefits) would work within the current system rather well.

&gt; Reform the whole tax system to make tax avoidance harder

Not even a sniff of detail, so I dismiss that as hot-air. And just like the Greens you appear to confuse ""avoidance"" with ""evasion"". Unless you are going to tell me that you want to pay **more** tax than you need to.

What are your opinions on taxing gross-income rather than profit?

&gt; Increase VAT on luxury goods.

&gt; Substantially reduce VAT on essential items.

Define ""luxury"", define ""essential"". Are office shoes/work boots essential? How about Prada loafers? They're all shoes, but only one is a true ""luxury"". Is the Gore-tex jacket I wear when hiking a ""luxury""? My motorcycle body-armour? Well, yes. Hiking and biking are non-essential to life, but massively raising the cost of equipment for people's hobbies is going to do you no favours. This appears to be yet another piece of ""tax the rich, tax *them*"" rhetoric that pervades your entire manifesto. Does it occur to you that you probably are part of the ""rich""?

&gt; Require that employers who sack workers contribute to their Unemployment Pay.

Uh, why? If someone is unfit for a job (i.e. incompetent), why should the company be effectively fined for getting rid of them. or are you asking companies to retain incompetent people and not hire competent ones in their place?

&gt; Repeal the Right to Buy provisions that ban councils from using house sale profits for construction.

Where will these new houses be built? As I walk around I see many, many abandoned/empty buildings that, with a bit of thought, could be re-purposed or simply levelled. Seems to me that this policy would encourage building on greenfield which raises the question of you stance towards the environment.

&gt; the corporate greed of the energy cartel.

Us/Them with a dash of paranoia. I must say, really does seem like you don't have a pension or if you do have one, have no clue how they work. Actually, pensions is a thing. I see no mention of the new policy of forcing the low-paid into shares-backed pensions, exposing the most vulnerable to the vagaries of the financial markets. Seems to me, as a party of the workers, this is **exactly** the kind of thing that should concern you.

&gt;  both men and women are expected to play certain roles and behave in certain ways, and are shamed for failing to do so.

Say what now? Never mind the entire concept of ""shaming"" someone for following their own free will...how the hell is that going to work? I can see the headlines now: ""Socialists Ban Barbie!"" That said, where is ""Barbie the Nuclear Physicist"" or ""Ken the hairdresser""? And why the shuddering hell does ""Lego Friends"" exist?

&gt; Fight for a more proportional electoral system.

Good. The current one is a raging cluster-fuck.

&gt; Reform the House of Lords into a fully elected or guild upper chamber.

See...here's the curious thing. The HoL is actually quite clever (well, was). It plays one system ""populist opinion"" (Commons) against ""we can do what the bloody hell we want and you can lump it"" (Lords) the other, hopefully between the two something approaching what is needed pops out. The thing with populist opinion is that is can be easily manipulated by the media - so people will vote based on media rhetoric rather than thinking for themselves. Not saying I'm all luvvey-duvvey with the Lords, I'm just worried that you propose to replace it with something *worse*!

Remove the Lords Spiritual, sure. Replace them with, perhaps, people plucked from science, engineering, medical etc fields (warning: they'll still be the ""rich"", sorry but highly qualified people tend to earn a lot).

&gt; Improve regulation of lobbying and ban second jobs for MPs. 

Hmm...tricky ones those. How does an MP know which choice to make? They speak to experts and get advice (a bit like you do). At what point does ""getting advice"" become ""lobbying""? And as for second jobs...depending on what that job is, could be a good thing. Keeps an MP in touch with the real world rather than existing totally within a Westminster bubble.

Isn't it ironic that a party-of-the-workers also wishes to deny someone the right to work? Or are you going to deny everyone the right to take second jobs? Reads like your whole us/them dichotomy again.

&gt; Lower the pay of all politicians in line with the average London wage.

So you don't want to encourage the best candidates to apply and you actually want to make taking money from outside sources *even more desirable*. Have you thought this through?

&gt; Vote for a democratic end to capitalism; vote Socialist!

Capitalism, in the pure sense, isn't bad. By far the most competitive section of the software industry is the F/OSS sector. That broiling and heaving mass of totally unfettered competition and innovation brings us more good than you could possibly imagine. And you know what happens to projects/developers (workers) that don't cut the mustard? They fail; or they get forked and run by others. This driving desire to push forwards *is* capitalism. It *is* the free market. There is *no* protection.

Why do you think that curtailing this is somehow going to be a benefit?

If you want to talk about monopolies, oligarchies and plutocracies etc; OK. But I put it to you that those are *not* capitalist and share more in common with socialism being command-based systems and no longer free markets.

Some things I'd like to run past you:

* Houses bought for MPs via the state paying the mortgage to remain the property of the state, not the MP. The state can then sell/rent as it sees fit. This should not preclude an MP picking the property that happens to fit their needs based on constituency etc.

* A prejudice towards free software for public works (i.e. GPL-or-compatible licensed). Paid for by the people, owned by the people. Would also allow other countries with little funds the ability to pick-up and run with the software.",null,0,null,1427454580,null,0,1427456143,0,cpseb8m,null,t3_30ez5a,null,t1_cpseb8m,null,t3_30ez5a,null,null,null,1432042669,null,2,false,nottingham,t5_2qmbu,2,null

A male-dominated, boisterous, discompassionate culture that can be quite detrimental to the 'progression' of society. You might think I am being too dramatic (well brace yourself) but I have thought this for a long time about Top Gear (and many other shows the BBC trots out). 

It's not just that the comments he made are offensive, they have at different times been described as racist, sexist, ablist, homophobic, classist and on almost every occasion I would agree, it's also not an issue of freedom of speech (he is ultimately an employee of the corporation). For me it is that a lot of the people who are defending him aren't defending his right to say such things (which of course he has) but that they agree with the things he says. I have seen many of his defenders use similar slurs without the privilege of receiving money in return and to those people he is an inspiration and a validation. 

It's not about whether one watches the show or not, personally i would enjoy a show about cars a lot more if it wasn't so rigidly formatted and casual bigotry wasn't a compulsory side order, but that it invades almost every pub, social gathering and work environment in the country and is a mean-spirited distraction from a unity that could benefit everyone. 

I feel like the BBC has relied on Top Gear for too long and I am genuinely interested to see if it will create something that is truly brave and irreverent in its place and use its enormous influence in a positive way as opposed to placating Middle England.

Also, to those who enjoy Top Gear, it was never going to last forever. Surely this is an excellent way to go out, courting the attention and controversy it sought during its production as opposed to gradual decline in quality and output, personnel changes and eventual cancellation.

To answer your other questions, if someone wanted to cancel something I generally enjoyed then I would look at the merits of both sides and choose rationally whether it is truly worth defending.

&gt;And if you look at countries where similar measures are already in place, thereâs far less litigation, which means that drivers pay lower insurance premiums.

&gt;But the one thing thatâs stood out in our research is that every country that has both a high percentage of people walking and cycling on a daily basis and a low number of people killed or injured in road accidents has some form of presumed liability in place.

I've helped a couple of friends out with their builds recently, the cheapest case I'd consider to be reasonably alright would be the CoolerMaster N300, or anything from that range (N200, N600 etc). The N300 has good air flow but is a bit of a pain to cable manage, so it might be worth thinking about spending a little more and getting a Corsair case.

Short answer: Theoretically yes, but in practice it's not going to happen.

Long answer:  The PM is the person who can command the confidence of the House of Commons, which is *usually* the leader of the largest single party after an election.  While there are no hard and fast rules that this *must* be the case, it's very difficult to see someone like Salmond, who wouldn't even be leader of the SNP group in Westminster if everything stays the same, commanding the confidence of the Commons.  Even if they have the best election imaginable the SNP would only be the third biggest party, and both of the big parties despise Salmond for a whole variety of reasons so the idea of him being some kind of compromise candidate in a hung Parliament isn't likely at all.

tl;dr While it is theoretically constitutionally possible that a much loved leader of a third party could become a compromise candidate for PM in a well hung Parliament, it's extraordinarily unlikely - and doubly so in the case of someone as hated as Salmond.

(It's actually considerably more likely to be Boris.  I'm not sure if that will cheer you up or not...)",null,0,null,1427457555,null,0,false,0,cpsf3rr,null,t3_30hbfl,null,t1_cpsf3rr,null,t3_30hbfl,null,null,null,1432043043,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

There are 3 things that might potentially happen:

1) You won't be able to board the train at Nottingham as your ticket won't allow you to get through the machine. You then have to go to the member of staff to let you through, and that person might, but if they notice that the ticket is not valid for this time of day they might refuse entrance.

2) A train conductor will ask to see your ticket. They may notice that your ticket isn't valid for the journey at this time of day. They will then charge you the difference that you owe.

3) Once you get to London you will have the same issue as in point no. 1, in that the machine won't accept the ticket and the member of staff may or not may not notice. To be honest you might be able to get lucky, if there are a lot of people disembarking at London and the member of staff is swamped they might not notice, but then again they might. But I'd reckon once you've gotten to London they'd probably let you through.

So yeah, I get that you're trying to save money but there's a reason why the tickets are more expensive during the peak hours when you intend to travel so don't be an arse about it, that's just the rules, and you might have to end up paying the same amount (or potentially even more).

TLDR; yes the ticket will be rejected by the barriers, you might end up having to pay the same amount or more if train conductors or station staff catch you out.",null,0,null,1427457576,null,0,false,0,cpsf3zz,null,t3_30hd3h,null,t1_cpsf3zz,null,t3_30hd3h,null,null,null,1432043046,null,12,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,12,null

&gt; That incident, another involving HMS Eagle, which is not detailed in the files, and the willingness of sailors to visit the bars of Bugis St, in Singapore, which were frequented by transvestites, led to demands for a crackdown on homosexuality.

&gt;""There is evidence that some officers and senior ratings do not take a sufficiently stern attitude towards minor homosexual acts,"" the Second Sea Lord said. ""The time has come to take a stricter and less permissive attitude in the fleet.""

I mean, it sounds like you're in favour of some form of reform, so what would that be? Please correct me if I'm wrong.

All political systems are broken to some degree, I am not saying I am against democracy, I just understand that it has its problems, at the very core of its ideology, and I am okay with. 

I would like a PR system, as it will make all the votes worth while. However, I accept that PR has massive issues. Do I mind them? No not really, they are just the issues that come with a PR system.

&gt; I don't want to have a King who lobbies the health minister for Homeopathy, and having no ability to remove him from a position of power. I think that is ridiculous in the 21st century. 

Counter to this, what gives any pressure group like the CBI or the Trade unions to lobby MPs, they are unelected groups who we as the people cannot get rid of, influencing policies. 

A monarch lobbying is no different than any other pressure group lobbying, he should get a say in how policies are formed as is the right of every other person in the UK. 

&gt;The elected HoS would have a totally ceremonial role, with no other real power, not even to influence. Look at Germany, what has their President done recently to influence the policy process? What about in Greece? etc. 

Then why should we go through the whole process of electing him, if he will just be some rubber stamp role? It seems like an utter time waste.

As I said in an earlier post, the British monarchy in our system is a sort of paradox. Where they are unelected and should be in theory unaccountable, however they have ended up being more accountable to the people than our elected representatives.

The Monarchs have to be these people that appeal to everyone as that is where their power comes from in the 21st century. The people. They are given an unofficial nod essentially by us to rule. 

The Monarchy gives many benefits to the British system and I will outline three of these here:

Social Cohesion: 

The Monarchy can achieve bringing people from different classes, from different backgrounds together. This is because, they give people one banner to unite around, they give people something to feel good about. Which during times of economic hardships, people need.

The reason why they are so good as being great in creating some unity in the nation is that they are very down to earth.

Many have taken roles which ordinary people take and do things that really, our Elected representatives should be doing a lot more often.

**Prince William**:

RAF Search and Rescue pilot.

He is also a Patron too many charities, essentially making them a lot more important as they have a lot more clout.

Tusk for example: http://www.tusk.org/index/uk

**Prince Charles**

The Princes Trust. I need not say anymore.

**Prince Harry**:

Apache Helicopter pilot. Done a tour in Afghanistan, helping the effort against Terrorism.

Created the Invictus games in the UK that helps wounded soldiers recuperate more effectively by bringing in sporting competitions.

It would mean so much less to the people if an Elected Head of State were doing these things. 

Fall back plan:

The Monarchy are also a good in ensuring that if anything does seriously go wrong in our democracy, they can step in, to stop hell breaking lose. They aren't influenced by party politics and do not have to tow the party line. They would have to rule with the knowledge that they are doing it for the nation. They are a banner which the people can unite around.

Foreign ambassadors:

The Monarchy are the best foreign ambassadors that the UK has to offer. Not only do they bring unity to our nations, they can bring it to other nations. Which elected head of states can't really do.

Another example, I have already used, is the Ireland-British one. It means so much more to both when the Queen went over to Ireland. It really shows how far we as two nations have come, even though we both have a very bloody and dark history. 

&gt; We already have division in our country based on class, how would this be any different?

Lets take two events: The Royal Wedding and people wanting to see Prince George. 

The make up for both of these events spanned from the rich to the poor, the Royals make people feel good. So much more than an Elected Head of State can. Why take that away in the name of accountability? why take away a system that is great in uniting the people?

&gt; In my opinion, a written constitution would be better than simply relying on norms and practices. I mean look at the whole situation with the speaker yesterday. Again, the manner in which that would be done would be tricky, to put it mildly.

A written constitution is pointless nowadays, it would just be a rubber stamp. Because most people would go mental if Governments seriously tried to get rid of the very fundamental rights of the people. You don't need something that takes time to create, and is poor to keep up with an ever changing society.

  editing for a bit of detail;  
  
  Last time I went to Wembley was CPFC vs Watford Play Off Final, beers outside the stadium from the pop-up bars were about 6 quid a pop, memorabilia was all cash only (scarf 15 quid, t shirts 10-25 depending, flags ranging in price on size and design, hoodies/zip ups all north of 30, some significantly so) and food was about 8 quid for a weird burger sandwich loaf thing, other things also available.  
  
  Chances are you'll blast out of work early and head to the ground, where you'll probably spend a fair amount of time outside getting a bit pissed as it's no smoking in the ground obviously (I'm sure you'll probably have a few smokers with you even if it doesn't apply, remember you'll not be allowed out once you're through the turnstiles).   
  
  One thing to note is lack of toilets near the ground, if you're coming from the tube up the main stadium approach to your right and down are a few restaurants and a large hotel. They also have a bar and toilets. This may be preferable if it's seriously rowdy, which is unlikely but you never know.  
 
  Do not leave it too late to go find your seat, they're good at getting people into the stands but the queues are pretty long. You do not need to smash yourself full of beer before the game outside. they do serve beer inside but you'll have to down it before you go through, and you'll be lucky if you get one at half as all the bars get fucking rammed to shit.

null,false,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,null,"&gt; It's a moral argument.

Well I was just speaking pragmatically but to answer your question I disagree, I don't think its a moral argument, its a pragmatic one.  
The problem with morality is that its absolute whereas pragmatically we can discuss the trade-offs and the primary trade off we're discussing here is:  

* Can we afford it?  

i.e. do we live in a civilization that is centralised enough to put aside a budget to deal with crime and punishment?  
If so, then its something we can consider and IMO we should consider, especially since it enables our justice system to err. With the death penalty in place you can't undo an incorrect decision. For me this is the primary reason why the death penalty is bad.  

The morality of ""never killing"" falls apart without civilization though. e.g in a wild west where it is not possible to accordingly punish people because mob rule can occur and its tricky to enforce the law. Same goes with Somalia's darker days where might equals right or other scenarios when killing might be your only option due to limited resources.  

&gt; I can't see how the cost savings would make it morally justifiable

Now this isn't what I was getting at, I'm looking for morally _consistent_. Do we punish or reform? I notice that our society at present doesn't have full ""buy in"" on the reform tip. This leaves us in a scenario where the state punishes/reforms criminals but citizens still feel the need to pass their own arbitrary judgement on other citizens that have been through the justice system. We don't trust our system to reform because our system doesn't really reform, we're still stuck in limbo between reform and punishment. This often results in criminals having a lot of difficulty re-integrating into society and in a lot of cases re-offending.  
I guess if we're going to talk about this morally then you might ask yourself what is ""kinder"", killing someone or dooming the rest of their existence?   
While its philosophically tidy to state that one shouldn't kill a killer you might also ask if the end result of avoiding their death is crueler or kinder than death and then we're back to asking whether we're looking to reform or punish the criminal.

Bringing back the death penalty would put us squarely in the punishment box again and bring down the costs (e.g. not spending tax money housing criminals ""worthy"" of death).  
I'd much rather us move to the reform box.... however that would require so many changes that our society is just not willing to accept. Everyone is still terribly eager to meter out their own form of punishment to offenders without trusting the justice system to do its job. A terrible example (but one that just springs to mind) might be how much of the discussion over Ched Evans discussed how he shouldn't play football as opposed to discussing why his sentencing and release were inadequate. This results in Evans specifically being punished because its high-profile, everyone low-profile being ignored and the underlying issues of the justice system being untouched. If we were a society ready to accept reform then the conversation would have centered around the legal system and reform system and not the specific subject and their life following release.

1) You are innocent until proven guilty by the Crown before a jury of your peers. What this is going to do is discourage defendants from exercising this right. Even if you may have committed the offence the Crown has to fucking prove it,  and if they can't then tough. Everyone has this right. 

2) Poor people and the mentally ill commit most crimes. A lot of the time it's because,  surprise surprise,  they don't have money or their have issues which are being ignored after cuts to funding for social care particularly in adults. Convicted defendants already face fines and victims repayment schemes. This is just cost cutting and passing it onto the most vulnerable. 

3) The UK has the best legal system in the world at present. This is fact. We are impartial,  well developed,  highly experienced and internationally renowned for this. There's a reason most commercial cases are heard here. Cuts to criminal funding are going to rip the heart out of proper defence work.

Having less government debt would not have shielded us from the effects of the financial crisis, which propagated through a lack of liquidity in private banks, not the government. Throughout the recession, government borrowing costs remained low, indicating that the markets never lost confidence in the solvency of the British government. (Because we have our own central bank). At one point, investors were even paying the British government to hold onto their money (negative real interest rates).

Deregulation of the banks was politically uncontroversial and had cross-party support. It was started by the Tories in 1986 and continued with Labour. It was universally agreed to be correct. And largely, it was correct.

The recession was caused by banks' liquidity problems resulting in less lending and a loss of confidence in business. The two combined to result in a fall in investment: banks stopped giving out loans, companies held off investment out of uncertainty. The economy slowed, employment fell, and consumer spending fell with it, high levels of household debt also playing a part.

I'm not seeing how the UK government's balance sheet has any role in all of this.

Step three: do a quick pubmed of the supervisors. When what and where have they publishEd? Who is the first author author? Is it a student orpostdoc?
Step four: make a shortlist. Go visit them. Find out if they are pricks

~100% of natives [and non-natives] speak English, English is the native language. *Cymraeg* is a historic native language of ancestors of the proportion of the population that aren't immigrant. 

The [Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/mwa/2011/1/contents/enacted) AFAICT is the closest thing to a statement of having Welsh as an official language. The only genuine official language, by statute, I gather has been Latin (from the Roman occupation).

&gt;forced learning?

Yes, all primary aged children are required to have the old Welsh language impinge on all lessons they learn in school. Despite this damaging outcomes and putting Wales behind the UK, which in turn is falling back against other countries (see eg. http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/pisa-2012-results.htm). Parents can choose old Welsh as their medium but can't choose New Welsh (aka English, the current native tongue) as their medium for the education of their children. Given the choice I'd choose English + a second World language chosen as a communication tool - either a modern European language (eg Spanish, French, German, Portugese) or a major global language (eg Mandarin, Urdu, Russian, Arabic). It's the only subject taught throughout the day, by edict, in English medium schools.

&gt;The number of speakers is on the increase

Not according to census data and the recent study by the Office of the Welsh Language Commissioner. I'd warrant they're the best available data.

&gt;Despite this Breton is still taught in most schools there and is used in daily life.

Your assertion contradicts Wikipedia. Do you have an official source to support your statement - I'll update Wikipedia if you do.

&gt;""In the late 20th century, the French government considered incorporating the independent Breton-language immersion schools (called Diwan) into the state education system. This action was blocked by the French Constitutional Council based on the 1994 amendment to the Constitution that establishes French as the language of the republic. Therefore, no other language may be used as a language of instruction in state schools. The Toubon Law implemented the amendment, asserting that French is the language of public education."" ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breton_language))

Wikipedia also claims that there are barely any under 60yo that speak Breton which goes against the thrust of your comments.

Past languages are an important part of who we are and warrant study by those passionate about them. For me as a Christian for example Akkadian and Ugaratic, Hebrew, Ancient Greek, Aramaic, Latin, late Mediaeval English, and yes *Cymraeg*, are all important languages in turn as they feed in to the passing on of the wisdom that relates to the Christian faith for me.

[Take a look here](http://www.debtbombshell.com/britains-budget-deficit.htm). The graph shows that during early Labour years when they promised to keep to Tory spending they actually ran a surplus. After 2001 they went spending and basically kept a deificit of ~ 2.5-3% of GDP. 

Now I doubt anyone disagrees that the UK needed investment and needs it still today. But that growth in spending during what was a prolonged boom (and a few other economic cock ups) pretty much guarenteed that when things went bad the UK would be in a bad place since the automatic stabilisers (e.g. benefits payments) shoot up as unemployment rises.

Bear in mind that during this period GDP was growing [at around 3%](http://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;idim=country:GBR&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:GBR&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false).

Despite the bursting of the .com bubble and a few other bumpy rides which slowed growth we'd not seen a recession since the early 90's. 

Now there's schools of thought that say during boom periods you should run a surplus to ensure that when bad times come around you are not forced to take on so much debt that the debt itself (or inflation, or currency devaluation) become obstacles to growth and getting out of the recession.

All in all, yes, there are very obviously levels of spending that are sustainable through a recession if you run a big enough surplus to have big reserves which countries like Norway or Russia have/had. So long as the net debt position remains low.

What I'm not seeing is how any of this, one way or the other, would have helped Britain during the financial crisis other than vague assertions about reserves. How, exactly, would reserves help reduce the impact of a recession, and in particular the financial crisis? I'm looking for the precise economic mechanism here, because I'm not seeing any connection between a government surplus, bank liquidity and confidence in the private sector.

The only thing I can find is this: 

&gt;you should run a surplus to ensure that when bad times come around you are not forced to take on so much debt that the debt itself (or inflation, or currency devaluation) become obstacles to growth and getting out of the recession.

However, the UK never got to this point, nor did we even come close to it, because we print our own currency. At no point during the recession was the government in a position where they could not borrow to finance a stimulus if they had wanted to. Indeed, our borrowing costs were so low (approaching negative real interest rates, at which point the government is making a profit off borrowing) that all economic sense said we should have been making the most of those low rates and borrow as much as we possibly could, paying off our high-interest debt and replacing it with low-interest.

Incidentally, our survival of the .com bubble had nothing to do with government spending and everything to do with very low exposure to risk. It was a largely US phenomenon.

My advice would be to take over a big team first, just to get to grips with the game. Also assign your assistant to do a lot of the things you're unsure of at first. 

It's probably worth copying a tactic from online, and reading about why it works to begin with, just to see what instructions work together, and what type of players you'll need to fit them. 

[For example](http://imgur.com/a/4FjUB#0), the first picture here shows my current tactic. The important thing to notice is firstly is the wings. IF's are inside forwards who primarily cut inside, sit narrower, and look to score. 

To compensate for their lack of width I have CWB's in defense who's primary focus is to overlap and deliver crosses from wide. With all this going on upfront, my midfield needs to sit a bit deeper with one cleaning up as the BWM(ball winning midfielder) and spreading the play to the DLP(deep-lying playmaker) who sits deep and opens up play from midfield. 

My AP is just a freak of nature, so I give him free-roam to do what he likes, and he produces Messi levels of goals.

null,false,WhereAreTheDufranes,null,null,null,"Primary needs to be addressed include: Striker, Central Midfield, Center Back, Right Back.

**Striker**: I think Jovetic is worth a look. He's on his way out and he's got immense potential. He's struggled to consistently crack the lineup at City and understandably so when they're purchasing players like Bony even with all of the depth they have in attack. If not him, then someone like him. A young player with potential that won't be expected to start every game (but can if need be or if on form). Other names to consider might be Lacazette (an ideal candidate, but pricey) or Luciano Vietto from Villareal (also could end up being pricey if he keeps scoring goals). Also worth mentioning is the return of Origi from his loan spell at Lille.

**Central Midfield**: I think Emre Can is the answer here. A fantastic passer, outstanding work rate, and exceptional skill. It will be much cheaper (and probably more effective) to utilize Can in midfield and buy a Central Defender than it will be to break the bank on someone like Pjanic - who is a world class talent but could cost upwards of â¬35m. 

**Center Back**: I think someone who can step into the starting XI is a must, especially if Can will be played in midfield. Perhaps Chelsea will look to offload Gary Cahill to make room for Zouma. Maybe Juan Jesus because Inter are looking to offload talent to make room to bid on Yaya Toure.

**Right Back**: Here's where I'm unsure. Will we revert to a back 4 or stick with a back 3? I think attack-minded full backs are a must for either system. One I really like would be Serge Aurier (on loan at PSG; under contract with Toulouse). Keep in mind we have Flano and potentially Manquillo if the deal is made permanent. But the need for a starting XI quality Right Back remains, because both players seem to be quality squad members but not (yet) consistent starting XI talent.

For example I purchased a 42 inch Sony tv from curries for Â£500. Extended warranty would have cost Â£130 for 3 years. Instead I looked at sony's own warranty which was Â£45 for 3 years. In the end I found out that currys redirect you back to the manufacturer after 28 days of ownership anyhow. What a rip off and I was glad I went with Sony's own warranty.

As he starts opening it there is a letter saying he ran a red and he is going to be fined X and have X amount of points.

Then he gets to the next dvla letter in the stack, it's a reminder than he needs to pay X amount.

Then the next letter, saying he will be taken court if he does not pay, followed by another with a court date.

Final letter outlines he didn't show so has been ordered to pay something in the order of Â£900 in total and has lost his licence. He tried to contest it but had to pay the full amount and retake his licence.

The Lisbon Treaty merged the different ""pillars"" of the EU into one thing, which brought the criminal justice measures (the EAW, police co-operation, that kind of thing) into the main body of EU rules. Some people weren't keen on this as it gave the EU courts some limited jurisdiction over criminal justice matters. The UK Government obtained an option to opt out of the whole package of criminal justice measures, with the understanding that then they could negotiate with the other national governments to opt back into any they wanted to keep.

The current Government held a vote in the House of Commons asking their opinion on whether to exercise this opt out, and the Commons said they should. The Government then had to go to the Commission and Council to negotiate opting back into the ones they wanted to keep (such as the EAW), and any new ones they wanted to sign up to as well - the deadline for this being December 2014. Which they just managed.

However that was only an EU/treaty thing; the UK Government agreeing to these measures - it didn't change UK law; to do that they had to pass some new regulations, adding the new stuff. But the EAW (and some of the other measures) was already in UK law (in the Extradition Act) so they didn't have to take any action in order to make it legal.",null,0,null,1427469012,null,0,false,0,cpskbt3,null,t3_30dbfh,null,t1_cpskbt3,null,t1_cpsgyg3,null,null,null,1432045515,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

This will require investment both of time and possibly money, but it's the most effective way to take financial control of yourself, and can put you in the best position financially. 

To cite one example, maybe one of your biggest annual costs is your electric supply, and maybe on investigation of that, you might find that your old PC being left on around the clock to download is costing you upwards of Â£300 year, based on consumption as reported by an on the wall meter, your rate per kWh, and a calculation to relate that to your usage. Spending Â£250 on a more energy efficient modern PC or laptop could reduce annual electric consumption by Â£250,  which means that by the end of year 1 you've broken even on your investment, and at the end of year 3, you've saved some Â£500. The same logic can be applied everywhere. High heating costs? How can you reduce the amount of best required to be comfortable? Thermal curtains, seals around door frames, better insulation, replacing windows, changing how you heat the place, etc, all that sort of stuff can have a massive impact, and by forming a full cost analysis, you can work out exactly what you can stand to save, or what you have saved, against each investment or change.",null,0,null,1427469306,null,0,false,0,cpski7u,null,t3_30htaa,null,t1_cpski7u,null,t3_30htaa,null,null,null,1432045599,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

It's something that you should bring up offhandedly so that you both can come from a place of comfort and security when you talk about it. Serious ""we have to talk"" types of conversations immediately put someone on the defensive. Avoid these words/phrases AT ALL COSTS. If I were you this is how I might do it:

OSC: Hey, so I was a little confused the other night, can you help me out?

GIRL: Yea of course, what's up?

OSC: I know you probably said it in the heat of the moment, but it really bothered me when you told me you don't believe that I care about you or your life in general. What's been confusing me is that I feel like any time that I do ask about what's going on with your career, I'm met with a cold shoulder and denied any incite into these types of things. I just want to make you happy and I really hate that we've had a couple of arguments because of this scenario...........

From there it really depends upon how she responds to you (i.e. defensive, open, etc)

A few keys here: TONE, APPROACH, WORDS. Keep all of these light, endearing, and optimistic. No matter what, try to project positivity and you'll be pleasantly surprised with your results. Also, don't force the conversation.

Discrimination of this sort continued way after JC was repealed. It didnât have to be in the law, the local law enforcement thought the behaviour was acceptable and hence didnât act on discrimination of the sort.


Another thing, the issue with your boycott proposal is that it relies on everybody not only being aware, but actually caring enough to boycott. If you're the average person in a country you're almost certainly not going to encounter any discrimination, so you're likely to be aware of it are you? Also, even if you are aware, what makes you think people will automatically care enough to do something? We see advertisements showing us starving children, saying that all we need to do is text in and we can give money to support, and the majority of us will just ignore it. What makes you think enough people are going to give a toss and actually participate consistently? The only people who will are those who are affected, who are by almost certainly a minority, and will hence not have large effect.

When the Â£1000 interest allowance comes in that'll be an another strike against cash ISAs (for your situation).

You mention fixed rate savings - you might be able to get a little more interest in a cash ISA this way but last time I checked they still didn't compete well with high-interest current accounts. Even then, you generally face some sort of penalty for early withdrawal and you may lose out if interest rates rise.

But if people had the views that you have, those things would still be around in some fashion today. With no government opposing discrimination, there would be nothing to stop landowners banning things like interracial couples on their land or businesses. I remember reading, for example, that during 1950s America, only something like 4% of people supported interracial marriages. Yes, government may have enforced these things, but government has also removed them. You libertarians constantly act like the government and the people are completely separate, when in fact the government is made up by the people, and if the power of the government is reduced, it doesn't mean the people are going to act any differently. A libertarian government in 1950s America would have still produced a very similar racial situations as the actual government in 1950s America. 

&gt; How about we just leave people alone?

Which is easy to say until you're on the sharp end of discrimination. You aren't being 'left alone' if you're being turned away from work, or from businesses, or from accommodation because of your race or sexual orientation.

People are the government. The government is not some separate entity which rules over people, it is (at least in a democratic society) the expression will of the majority. 

Also, the government itself does not have a monopoly on oppression. As the American south has proved, as the ethnic cleansing perpetrated in the middle east has proved, groups of people are just as capable of dealing out oppression without the guise of government. All they need is more force.

Because. People. Are. Happier.

The second issue seems most likely to be some general insecurity about your relationship, as in, she's trying to tell if you really like her or just like having sex with her. My advice: don't take it personally, because it's likely not. Next time she gets upset about that, act concerned and not angry. Reiterate that you care about her. Ask her what you're doing that has given her the impression that you don't care (NOT defensively, with genuine interest and concern). If she's being unreasonable, do your best to ignore it and focus on the feeling. You won't be able to reason your way out; you have to address her underlying fear / concern. 

On top of that, make sure you're doing things to regularly communicate your interest in her as a person. If you do all of that and the relationship continues to develop, the problem should resolve itself as she gets more comfortable and confident that you're not going anywhere. 

Good luck!

If a simple spur system breaks then all of the sockets downwind of the fault just stop working, immediately alerting the homeowner that something is up.

If irrational fear of the SNP is what it takes to wake people up and demand a real PR referendum then so be it but it's pretty frustrating to see people who pulled every dirty trick in the book to stop AV now suddenly begin to care.  It's equally telling that the so called advocates of electoral reform in the Lib Dems are happily joining in, they're just as to blame for not demanding a real PR referendum.

Labour voters should be looking at why SNP support could benefit their party by dragging them back to the left for this election anyway, a reality often overlooked by the media despite a lot of discontent with how British politics seems to now be dominated by very right wing ideals.  By all means fix FPTP but to do so just because of the SNP bogeyman (cos the sun said so) is just typical of how this country operates.

I live in Leith, which is pretty close to the centre with good bus connections and cheaper than some of the fancier areas. There are still plenty of pubs etc to spend your time in.

Can't say directly as I'm not a American student, but a few of my American colleagues have found the workload pretty hard going (in a social science subject). I think it's partly because their essay writing style is different somehow - not exactly sure in what way! - so some of them have been pretty dissapointed with their marks. 

Definitely take advantage of any writing workshops etc at the beginning of the year so you know what is expected of your work. There is also always a thesis element (15,000 words) which a few of the American's didn't have to do for their undergrads so feel a little uncertain about.

There is no such requirement for other claims. Technically there is nothing stopping you doing it using your Canadian address, and issuing your claim form by post by sending it to the [Salford Business Centre](https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money/overview). The difficulty you'll have is that the court fee needs to be paid in Sterling, and the only way if you're doing it by post is by cheque. You'd therefore have to get your Canadian bank to draw you a cheque in Sterling, and I bet that there's a hefty fee for doing that. Similarly if you succeed and get a judgment, you face the problem of enforcement. Â£395 is a very small sum to try to enforce, and any step you take with the court will require another fee, and so on.

I'm pretty mild though and before it had a chance to get much worse than a swelling face and tongue I nipped out to the shops to buy antihistamines and chewed them up.  Not anaphylaxis like some people will go in to.  I talked to the manager and suggested to prominently label the dish as containing peanuts as there's such a good chance of killing someone.  He seemed to take it on board. 

Two weeks later we (ambulance) were called to a hotel in the town where a visitor had eaten from the same takeaway and this time actually had an anaphylactic reaction.  He did not have his epipen and required us to administer adrenaline, you know anaphylaxis when you see it and the only way to correct it is adrenaline.  

Nobody is telling you to remove peanuts from your dishes if you don't want to but for fucks sake make sure its labelled, this allergy isn't rare and for some like me its just a case of swelling and a little airway obstruction but for others it's fatal.  Anyone who's allergic to peanuts knows how sensitive you are to the taste but by the time you detect it the reaction has begun and you need to do something about it.  The severely allergic might not even get this chance.

[Page 29 of the report](http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/media/38945/bsa32_fullreport.pdf) as quoted in the article.

Certainly none of these findings suggest that there is any inaccuracy involved in characterising Ukip as a party of the âradical rightâ

The very next paragraph acknowledges they are on the left on issues such as social equality (page 28 table 6). Indeed most of the section on ukip (pages 20 to 29) quietly concede that on most issues the ukip supporter has common views to the average voter and makes no conclusions from them facts.

The only major differences is ukippers are more distrusting of government 20% trusting vs 40% average (page 25 table 4) and attitude towards the death penalty (page 24 table 3).

The glaring omission that I see is any questioning about a controlled immigration policy anywhere in the survey which is after all ukips main point aside from a EU referendum. Instead they chose to reference their 2013 survey (page 22 bottom paragraph) which asks if ""immigration undermined or enriched british cultural life"" which in my mind is kind of a loaded statement like saying if you are against open doors you are a bigot and completely ignores the question of volume of immigrants.

Started doing a meal plan. I made a menu and ordered the food online to fit the meal plan. Â£56!!! Shocked. No food wastage at all, we ate everything. And I got the satisfaction of ticking off the meals as I made them and creating my own menus to put on the wall.  -what can I say, I'm a weirdo.

Packed lunches rather than buying out saves money too. My meal plan was for all meals so the actual saving was even higher because I used to have all my lunches out. 

Joined kindle unlimited Â£7 a month. Used to spend at least Â£25 a month on books. Now I try to read mostly the unlimited selection with just the odd 'general selection' book. Could just download them for free but the books I want are never there anyway.

Also random thing I have picked up on - if you buy a few 'value items' on your online shop or obscure things they might not have in stock -they replace it with more expensive items at no higher charge. For example I often buy value corn flakes for my son to make chocolate cornflake cakes. They never have them in so I've always been sent normal ones. Same with fish, they never have the whole trout which are about Â£3/4 each so you end up with something pre cleaned and filleted, the same weight, but the same price! 

Pretty small savings but they add up over the year and let you have extra treats.
