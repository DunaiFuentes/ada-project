Bacuna popped up all over the pitch. He's not very good even at his own position so what does he think he could do by playing in a free role?

null,null,Prannet,eng-GreaterLondon,London,null,"The point of opposition isn't to literally just go against everything the government is saying simply because that will be easiest for the public to digest.
The point of opposition is effective scrutiny, and being able to hold government to account, while also making them fear for their tenure. This is a key point as otherwise you are a lame duck opposition. Corbyn isn't credible, isn't electable and therefore can't do any of these things. All he can do is shout and moan in perpetuity as he has done for all of his career in the Labour party.

&gt;Corbyn isn't credible, isn't electable 

And yet here he is, still favourite for the leadership, still wiping the floor with the other three. I'm not actually a Corbyn supporter tbh but I can see the appeal. He's shouting and moaning while Burnham, Cooper and Kendall sit with their hands in their pockets and he means what he says. Like it or not, that makes him a lot more popular and credible than the other three.

&gt;On the welfare bill, let me try another line of reasoning seeing as you understand how the reasoned amendment works so well, even though it doesn't seem like you read that article. A simple way to look at it would be to imagine how it would be turned against them if they had voted against the bill on the whole at such an early stage, given some of the measures in there that they do actually support and have campaigned on. ""Labour votes against cheaper social housing"" would be the cry from the Tory government, e.g.


&gt;even though it doesn't seem like you read that article.

That's not an article, mate. It's a blog post from an MP trying to justify their actions. Like it or not, the only thing to come out of that mess was the quote from Corbyn that escapes me right now. Instead of leading to Tory spin, it lead to [this](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/20/corbyn-becomes-only-labour-leadership-candidate-to-vote-against-welfare-bill) and [this](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/welfare-cuts-vote-welfare-bill-that-will-cut-welfare-spending-by-12bn-passed-in-parliament-with-a-majority-of-184-despite-large-labour-revolt-10403340.html)


&gt;You seem to also miss the reality that it would have gone through anyway. So again, smarter to try and convince your ""enemy"" of a way to amend and moderate the law they are trying to get through. That is why bills go through so many stages.

And how did that go? 

&gt;A bill isn't a black and white, all or nothing thing. It's a little more complicated and nuanced than that. Simply expecting the party to mechanically oppose everything just because it's put forward by another party is absurd, and is entirely contrary to how politics actually works. Politics is actually about horsetrading. Not some sort of legislative football match.


I would agree that opposition for oppositions sake isn't really constructive tbh.

I'll stop this here because it's hard to care as much when I'm not drunk but if Corbyn isn't electable and isn't credible and isn't this and isn't that, exactly what does that say about the other three contenders consideriing the thrashing that's predicated?

I looked at and seriously considered training to be a teacher. A music teacher in fact, which, as noted, is currently one of the areas facing a significant issue. The costs of living in London for a year whilst training were prohibitive. Even the additional grants for target areas like music are only really significant (when in London) if you get a first. The warnings that you would get stressed and tired, coupled with advice from friends and colleagues was that I would be unable to work with any reliability part time whilst training to be a teacher. So hungry, tired and stressed for a year, and for what?

A mediocre starting pay packet, that I'm already earning over just as a graduate professional musician. A career path that is frustratingly linear, with progression leading to management positions with schools or exam boards. A ending pay packet, that isn't particularly note worthy unless you become a head teachers or similar. Hours that are long, unforgiving and relentless, a work environment that is generally considered non supportive by people in the industry according to the various surveys they do... I could continue. 

Oh, and the music course is boring to learn and boring to teach, and the private tutoring I do occasionally for the exams is enough to make me want to shoot myself. 

Except that fixing that requires specialist music teachers to enter the system across the system, boosting and enhancing music education cohesively from day one, so that by the time they get to GCSE level they're a little beyond ""this is a C  major chord"". And, frankly, that isn't going to happen.

Music departments are underfunded, understaffed and normally dominated by people that did a music degree and then realised they didn't know what to do next. Even the basics of a music department support staff (piano, performance space, high level pianist for accompanying) is missing in some schools, and things like bands, orchestras, choirs, music groups..? You may as well pray for Jesus to come down from above and bless you with his munificence. 

Except in private schools, where teachers are paid significantly more, music departments have much greater funds, students have much more financial freedom to engage with music and staff tend to all be highly qualified performers as well as experienced educators. 

Why is there a shortage of music teachers? Because for the last ten years, music and the Arts have been cut, cut and cut again. And now there is barely any money and anyone capable of doing it to a high level would rather earn double a teacher's wage doing something more rewarding, more engaging and with less teenagers. 

The best (?) part is that my opinions are shared by every fresh graduate from music degrees I've spoken to. Some are going into teaching anyway, mostly females at primary level, but most view it on the same level as ripping out fingernails. 

And there's a lot of concern over the future of music in this country generally I feel, considering how many of my fellow graduates have already left the country to take work elsewhere in other countries for better pay and better conditions. Goodbye anyone good enough to land foreign contracts. Guess what that means for music education?

Rant over. This is something I'm rather passionate about and I could literally go on about this for days.

There are many more variables while flying, the requirement for good decision making is far higher, and a low-energy state is an unstable, dangerous regime for an aircraft to be in, whereas a low energy state in a car, train or ship is stable and safe, making emergency management in planes far harder. A computer - not being an intelligent, sentient being - cannot make reasoned decisions, cannot think outside the box, cannot track developing threats. It can only carry out actions it has already been told to do, and as unforeseen events occur regularly in aviation that nobody had adequately predicted, with human pilots being the only way of mitigating them, a fully automated airliner will not be safe. At least not until we make a breakthrough in the fundamental capabilities of computers - i.e., intelligence and decision making. 

In any case, airliner designers are not trying (yet) to design pilots out of the cockpit because they understand that although the human element can and does cause accidents, it is also capable of some ingenuity and more often than not saves the aircraft from a dangerous situation. The task for designers is not to create an aircraft without pilots, but to create an aircraft that mitigates the errors pilots are good at making, while making full use of what they're really good for - situational awareness and decision making. This can be seen clearly in Airbus' design - the fly-by-wire protections are there to assist the crew and not let them make the kind of mistakes stressed pilots have been known to make, e.g. stalling the aeroplane, getting disoriented and going into a spiral, etc., while leaving the crew fully in command to manage the flight.

null,null,JohnnyButtocks,scot-orkney,Orkney,null,"&gt;Well from my point of view, at the very least you have to stand up for the country and defend what's right

You need to get specific, because that just sounds like vague jingoism.

Corbyn has been proven right over northern Ireland and the IRA. He knew back in the 80's that the only route to peace is to include all sides in the peace process, and to acknowledge the legitimacy of the other side's grievance. He was talking to the IRA when the govt still wanted Gerry Adams' voice dubbed on the tv... The people who wanted to stand up for ""the country"" wanted to send the army in. How'd that work out?

His policy on Palestine/Israel is the same. Get everyone talking and on amicable terms as human beings. If there is ever a solution to that problem, it will vindicate Corbyn's approach. 

He was also vindicated on South Africa, while the Tories were still arguing against an embargo.  He was opposed to the western policy of toppling foreign leaders in places like Iran and Chile. Meanwhile people like Thatcher and Reagan were literally *advising* tyrants like Pinochet on how best to rid their countries of socialism.. Again, who was on the right side of history?

He also, when it comes to Ukraine, sees NATO as an aggressor, and cause of Putin's recent expansionism. I think any rational analysis has to accept that the invasion of Ukraine was directly caused by the ongoing threat of NATO expansionism. At the fall of the Berlin Wall, NATO powers swore they wouldn't expand up to Russia's borders, into their sphere of influence. They have been steadily expanding eastward ever since. What happened in Ukraine was an undemocratic coup, to remove the elected, pro Russian govt, and replace it with a pro EU, pro NATO one. From Russia's point of view, the country in which their entire naval fleet was docked, their only presence on European waters, was about to switch sides, to join the military alliance which has had nukes pointed at their civilian centres for 60 odd years. How do you think America would have reacted in a similar scenario? In the 80's their application of the Munro doctrine was so generous as to demand, unilaterally, that they wouldn't tolerate socialism or pro USSR govts in the same hemisphere as them... None of that means that Putin isn't a dangerous illiberal dictator, but a clear policy of denying Russian border states NATO membership would have probably cooled the situation enormously. But those arguing for what's ""right"" and claiming to protect western interests are universally in favour of NATO expanding up to Russia's border.

Sometimes what creates or maintains peace doesn't feel patriotic or brave.

Secondly, the way he is treating kozak is a joke, especially after the pre-season he had. Play him, if he is not good enough then fine, but he hasn't even been given the chance to prove himself. 
On top of that, some teams, palace, Leicester ect have come out the stables flying, now the time this will become an issue is of they continue to perform, while we don't start to improve. 
Aswell, Palace worked us out extremely quick, pardew is no fool, if he can, so can other managers. 49% of their attacks came down their left, our right wing. They attacked bacuna, left amavi with only 11% of their attack to defend, they figured out our weakness and Sherwood did nothing to stop them. These sort of things are what will cost us games, if we allow teams to adapt and dont do so ourselves we will fall behind.

The idea that helping the WORKING poor is crippling them is so incredibly stupid that you have to wonder what future generations will think of us. Raising the minimum wage and cutting tax credits also directly makes the majority of those children living below the poverty line poorer (IFSs own data). 

Tax credits are more progressive and fairer than a minimum wage, the only reason people are whining about them is because they don't want to pay more taxes when they're well off, because they're greedy cunts.

null,null,34Mbit,null,null,null,"**Emergency fund:** Work out a monthly budget and save 6 months worth of expenses. You can keep this money in any sort of cash-account like an ISA, as long as you've got instant (or at least reasonable) access. Glancing at your numbers, you could probably stash away a 12-months emergency fund in a year (~¬£500/month saved). I keep about 6 months in an ISA, and one month in cash hidden away.

I'd look to save for more than a six-month fund in your case, because your expenses are so low and an emergency fund is often used to fund emergency 'big purchases' too, not just regular outgoings - for example if you needed to buy a car quickly for a new job opportunity. It's nice to know you've got a few grand in the bank that you can use to buy a *decent* car if you need it, etc.

**Pension:** Check what pension provisions your employer offers. Most offer an arrangement where you 'salary-sacrifice' a percentage of your pre-tax pay, which they match for free. So if you sacrifice 5% of your pay, they might put in another 10% taking your ongoing investment to 15% of your gross pay (¬£3,000 in your case).

That money should then be invested in your company's appointed pension investment service. The charges are often less than impressive, but you have to suck it up if you want your company's free money. Invest in high-risk stocks and forget about it until you leave.

**Regular Saving:** Once you've fleshed out a budget, sorted out an emergency fund and are happy with your pension, your next job is to continue saving your money (that would have otherwise been putting towards an emergency fund). One idea for you is to calculate the cost of renting your own place (including bills, tax, etc.), subtract the 'keep' you're paying your parents and squirrel that away - that way you're used to the regular outgoings that come with your own place. 

Lastly, you should always keep 'personal improvement' in your plans and budgets. This could be budgeting for books, exams or classes to improve your career skills, or maybe getting a driving license if you don't have one, or some other forms of certifications that will help your earning potential. If you're earning ¬£21,000, then you're effectively an asset worth around ¬£500,000 (with a return of 4-5%); if you can get an additional qualification or certificate that improves your earning potential by ¬£3,000 then you can turn a ¬£500 exam into a ¬£60,000 increase in your value. It's a bit heartless obviously to think of a human as that, but it's helped me appreciate the value of useful education.

null,null,square13,null,null,null,"&gt; He also, when it comes to Ukraine, sees NATO as an aggressor, and cause of Putin's recent expansionism. I think any rational analysis has to accept that the invasion of Ukraine was directly caused by the ongoing threat of NATO expansionism. At the fall of the Berlin Wall, NATO powers swore they wouldn't expand up to Russia's borders, into their sphere of influence. They have been steadily expanding eastward ever since. What happened in Ukraine was an undemocratic coup, to remove the elected, pro Russian govt, and replace it with a pro EU, pro NATO one. From Russia's point of view, the country in which their entire naval fleet was docked, their only presence on European waters, was about to switch sides, to join the military alliance which has had nukes pointed at their civilian centres for 60 odd years. How do you think America would have reacted in a similar scenario? In the 80's their application of the Munro doctrine was so generous as to demand, unilaterally, that they wouldn't tolerate socialism or pro USSR govts in the same hemisphere as them... None of that means that Putin isn't a dangerous illiberal dictator, but a clear policy of denying Russian border states NATO membership would have probably cooled the situation enormously. But those arguing for what's ""right"" and claiming to protect western interests are universally in favour of NATO expanding up to Russia's border.
&gt; 

Your Ukraine/NATO position is ridiculous.

How about this, which is basically the same situation; can you imagine if there were a military alliance of former British colonies that was set up to ensure that the UK would have no influence after decades of colonial rule. Now imagine if the UK annexed part of Kenya or Ireland because of it's increasing growth.

In actual fact I think just one change could fix most of the issues of demoralisation.

I believe the education system should be run by an independent body of educational experts (i.e. not the government).

Obviously the government needs to have influence but every time a new party gets into power there is a dramatic shift in what we teach and how we teach it and basically we have to start from square one again.

It also means that young people's education becomes an ideological battleground. I don't think that is fair on the students. Should their history lessons be focused on Britain? Should it be interpretive or fact-based? Are we trying to encourage national identity or not? Is it ok to criticise democracy? Somebody studying politics or history today will have a very different experience to somebody studying it 7 years ago.

Additionally, teachers feel like their pay and pensions have been pulled from under their feet. People are never going to be happy with cuts, but it could have been handled a lot better with a more gentle transition. I think a body of experts would have been able to provide that by virtue of being less ideologically driven than politicians and more concerned with the sector.

What our education system needs more than anything is stability. Our system creates politicians with 5-year ambitions. I don't blame the politicians for this, this is inherently part of the system. Establishing an independent body could work around this.

At the moment he isn't in form in an attacking sense, and he adds nothing defensively, so it's like playing with 10 men. 

&amp;nbsp;

In my opinion we need another strong, defense-inclined player to sit next to Matiƒá (think about Tour√© &amp; Fernandinho), who is being overrun at the moment, leaving the back 4 exposed. Obviously lots of people (me included) would love Pogba to be that player, but realistically, RLC looks like he could fit that role. He is big and strong, has good feet, as well as having the ability to dribble and pass. Considering his performances thus far this season, I think F√†bregas should be dropped for the game against Everton and RLC should start.

If you think that's an even *remotely* comparable situation, you have an utterly *fantastical* idea of what NATO is... 

NATO is Russia's allied, nuclear armed enemies from the cold war.. What it is clearly *not* is a defensive alliance of former Soviet states.. There are a grand total of 3 former Soviet states who have joined Nato, only two of which share a border with Russia. They are Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. They joined in 2003. Georgia was well on its way to joining before 2008. So who is expanding up to who's borders? This is just historically illiterate I'm afraid.

Edit: just to be clear, I don't blame the Baltic states or Poland etc one bit for wanting to ally with NATO. I would too if I was in their place. My complaint is with the US and other influential NATO leaders using expanding NATO membership as a way to continue expanding their political interests up to the Russian border and sphere of influence. What do you think will happen if you support a coup, the purpose of which is to flip Ukraine into the EU/NATO sphere of influence, when the country is host to the entire Russian naval fleet, in Crimea?

He will be crucified by the Conservatives for his past statements.  Even if he turns out to be moderately capable (which I doubt), his past is enough to make him absolutely unelectable as prime-minister.

&gt;No one individual has complete control over their party politics, so it'll be interesting to see how much his policies will be curtailed by his party.

The Labour party *will* be judged by their leader.

Ok youre really missing the point here, last season Kane and Eriksen (and Chadli) finished their chances crazily well which led to us winning games where we were outplayed by the opposition (Swansea, Leicester away being the prime examples). This season we have consistently being better than our opposition however our finishing has been incredibly poor and weve conceded an own goal, and a stupid penalty in our first four games - these things will not continue to occur. There will be a regression to the mean in our finishing. Kane and Eriksen have both been playing well this season anyway btw - kane just hasnt the goals to show for

This.  I don't know whether they did it as a compromise to get in and get their legitimately good ideas like SureStart, minimum wage, etc. going, or if there's a more disheartening truth to it, but one of New Labour's lasting legacies for me was to lock in neoliberal thought by throwing away its mainstream opposition and embracing its core ideas while shifting leftwards on the details.

Funnily enough, when there are two main sides to a process, one side proposes something, and the other side tacitly accepts it, received wisdom comes down that that something is mainstream and challenging it is ridiculous.  Thatcherism in 1997.  Austerity in 2010.

Danny Rose owned that side of the pitch in the second half - his tenacity, and athleticism were amazing.  His movement off the ball was non-stop.  He was powerful and precise when he did have the ball - and when the opposition gained possession - he was relentless.  I wound up watching Danny rather than following the ball around.  I don't regret it.  It was the Danny Rose show, and I had a front row seat.  

Ever since that match, I rate him incredibly highly.  He is quality and class.   I have been nervous this whole summer - I feel like the club doesn't rate him quite as highly as he deserves, and he might go to another PL squad that recognizes his quality and makes a generous offer.

null,null,heulian,null,null,null,"This answer provides very solid advice.  To offer a few additional points:

I'd base your emergency pot over an estimated cost for living alone, as I imagine you will be thinking about moving out in the next few years.  As such, you should build up to a 6mo-12yr emergency savings buffer gradually; over 1-3 years.  As OP suggests, most of it in an ISA (or high-interest like Santander) is a good shout.

Don't contribute more to your pension than your employer will match.  I.e. if they cap out at 5%, only put in 5%.  You have other priorities at the moment.
 
Regular savings/spending should be geared towards your priorities.  Sit down and have a good think about what you want to do over the next 6 months/year, and areas of yourself and personality that you want to develop (not just career!).  Suggestions (not that you need to take these, they're just what some may find rewarding in your situation) are: moving out, getting a girlfriend/boyfriend (sort of depends on the first item, hehe), being a rockstar at your job, getting additional training, getting/staying in shape (e.g. joining a gym or sports club), and pursuing any hobbies you couldn't really do before.  You can now afford any/all of these and more, so carve out some space in your budget for whatever you want!  This sort of spending pays for itself far, far more than any stock-market investing ever could, as you are investing in your own awesomeness, happiness, and future earning potential.  Don't neglect soft skills (E.g. public speaking, networking abilities) when thinking about career enhancement and earnings potential.
 
Investing.  Don't be afraid to start small and start early, if only for interest's sake (pun intended).  I would personally get rid of your student debt entirely and build up a safety net before even looking at this area, but that depends on your comfort level with debt. If you opt to invest first, head over to [/r/investing](http://investing.reddit.com) to get started.  
 
Always, always keep your lifestyle below your income.  It sounds like you have a good handle on this already, so I won't harp on about it!

Now get out there and kick some butt!

[This graphic from the BBC shows how Palace looked to exploit our right hand side throughout the match](http://c.files.bbci.co.uk/3F12/production/_85264161_capture.png) and though I don't have details for our other games it wouldn't surprise me if there is a trend. 


We could be scoring more goals, but I don't think that's our main issue. If we were keeping clean sheets/limiting teams to one goal then we would have a hell of a lot more points than we do currently with our goal tally. 


Depending on injuries this is the team I'd like to see in the next league game:


Courtois


Azpilicueta Zouma Cahill/Terry Baba


Loftus-Cheek Matic


Pedro Oscar Hazard


Costa


We would miss some of Fabregas' ability on the ball, though at times he's been messing up simple passes, but I think we would be a lot more secure in midfield. Baba and Azpilicueta would be able to offer genuine width and should have the pace and energy to get back when the ball is turned over. Loftus-Cheek is a bit of a risk to put in but frankly the way we are performing I think it's a risk worth taking, he looked up for the game when he came on against Palace and *could* be the answer to our cries for a physical B2B midfielder.

Jota is a huge loss. Even if he makes it back he'll not be match fit.

We are a team in transition, new players from Europe, a new manager, everything changing. so I have lowered my expectations to a middle table finish. I'd be happy 3 spots above relegation. It will make the season if we beat QPR and or Fulham. Next season the play-offs.

What happened to that movement and through passes type of play? Everything looks so static now. Milner, while he is a complete beast when it comes to running and dominating the midfield, isn't able to create anything in the final third. Benteke, short of creating a magic goal in a solo fashion, isn't able to find the player running through in a quick 1-2 play we used to see last time. Or the player making that run always just runs into a wall of defenders instead of an open space. Or all our shots from the wide are somehow blocked, especially Clyne.

This is not! I understand marking would take a long time but I presume some of it can be fairly dull others actually quite interesting? Does it require a lot of thought?

What is a post-16 PGCE course? Is that just for A-level teaching? Wouldn't normal PGCE give me more of a scope and a greater chance of employment?

Lampard/Oscar. When ever Lampard got the ball on the last 3rd part of the field and faced towards the goal, you would instantly think ""This is a dangerous moment"". His abilities to shoot and pass combined with his eye for the bigger picture just made him a threat in anyway possible. This forced the opponents defense to push out to prevent this, giving up alot of spaces behind them. Oscar - when he is playing up to the best of his  abilities - got what Lampard had. The Problem is just that, where Lampard always gave everything and always on top level, Oscar is just so inconsistent.

Malouda/Willian: Well, Willian doesn't posses any threat to the opponents goal really where as Malouda with his direct plays would cut into the box looking for the opportunity to score or make the last pass.

And then there was Essien. He might not have been part of the dedicated attack, and he didn't have a lot of goals, but give him the ball within 35 yards from the goal and he could pull out a screamer.

Take a look at this compilation with 10 of his goals. Close to the back line, 35 yards out, in the middle of the box and so on. All position he got the ball he was a threat. Where is the threat in Fabregas? When the smaller team pack up the bus where is the long distance threat the either forces them out or having them becoming a shooting tent.

Our 2010 champion team attack with everything they could. If they saw the smallest opportunity, they sieged it and they would attack with the furiousity of a lion.

Pearce often gets singled out because his opinions often (*often* not always) seem to be in staunch defence of Rodgers.

Firstly Echo writers are local so rely on those within the club for information, secondly due to the first point they don't want to upset those at the club by going against what they say (and thus souring their main source of news) and finally they know what the fans want to hear (ie. in the Raheem situation, they know that fans want to hear about how bad he is etc etc)",null,0,null,1440932830,null,null,1440933309,0,cukn71y,null,t3_3ixyso,null,null,null,t1_cukmuyd,null,null,null,1441583524,null,3,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

null,null,backtowriting,null,null,null,"&gt;He‚Äôs anti austerity as well as anti war. Corbyn also opposes Israeli politics. This fact was enough to make him uniquely unpopular amongst British Jewry. 

I think it was more the detailed and credible allegations that he has consistently allied himself with antisemites, but whatever.

Edit:  For those who are confused as to the nature of the claims /u/pacifismisevil [recently put together an excellent summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3igck7/antisemitism_has_no_place_on_the_left_it_is_time/cug9j43).  (It was of course downvoted by the usual Corbynista bullies.)  I reproduce it below - 

----------------

Let's look at some facts about Corbyn, for all the people who claim he is not an anti-semite:

1. He supports ethnically cleansing Jews from the West Bank. His anti-semitism when it comes to Israel is clear by this and his [long disproven](http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2010/01/06/correction_israel_palestinians_story/) claim there are Jew only roads in the West Bank.

2. He has stood arm in arm with [Hugo Chavez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez#Allegations_of_Anti-semitism). He supports many totalitarian regimes around the world - the ones that are ""coincidentally"" the biggest enemies of the UK and USA, and which have domestic policies totally contrary to his supposed liberal views.

3. He has worked for Iranian state television. The Ayatollahs are vehemently opposed to communism and secularism - the only reason he likes Iran is because of their anti-american and anti-Israel views and [their funding of terrorism around the world against American allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_and_state-sponsored_terrorism).

4. He publicly praises Putin and Russia Today.

5. He calls Hamas and Hezbollah friends, and tries to claim he was just being diplomatic but he also then claims Hamas and Hezbollah are dedicated to ""bringing about long-term peace and social justice and political justice in the whole region"" so it is obvious he meant it when he called them friends. This is the Hamas ""social justice"" that jails women for 5 years for having children outside of wedlock, and have executed hundreds of ""collaborators"" without trial [who in reality had no links to Israel](https://vimeo.com/125778303). He says the British government labeling them terrorist organisations ""is really a big, big historical mistake.""

6. He has made anti-Israel policies his highest priority. He writes more about Israel than his own constituency on his website. His 3 sons are likewise obsessed with demonising Israel on their Facebook accounts. 

7. It is difficult not to see a pattern in Mr Corbyn‚Äôs associations. He has strongly associated with holocaust deniers, terrorists and antisemites, and publicly defended them. There is little doubt he is untroubled by anti-semitic views amongst his friends.

8. [Corbyn jumped to Stephen Sizer‚Äôs defense](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3191393/Jeremy-Corbyn-defended-controversial-vicar-banned-social-media-promoting-clearly-anti-Semitic-material.html), saying that Sizer was under attack by a ‚Äúpro-Israel smear campaign.‚Äù

9. Corbyn recently pulled out of a meeting where he was due to appear on a platform with Latuff, second prize winner in Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad‚Äôs Holocaust Denial cartoon contest, and Azzam Tamimi, a London defender of Hamas who says that suicide bombing is a ‚Äúnoble cause‚Äù and he would do it if he had the opportunity. It's not that he was unaware of these things when he agreed to attend, he just didn't want the controversy after it became public knowledge. 

10. Corbyn is a patron of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, an organization dedicated to fighting for a boycott of Israel and which has a record of tolerating anti-Semitism within its ranks. Corbyn supported Deir Yassin Remembered for years after it had become clear that its founder Paul Eisen was an open Holocaust denier. He believes [Israel is the sole country in the world deserving of a boycott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_in_the_World#Middle_East_and_North_Africa), and opposes sanctions on Iran - a country that hangs gay men in the street.

11. Corbyn was pictured hosting spokespeople for the IRA days after that organization had tried to kill prime minister Margaret Thatcher in the Brighton bombing. Pictures have emerged of Corbyn sitting next to Dyou Abou Jahjah on a platform, a man who says that the ‚Äúdeath of every British soldier is a victory.‚Äù

12. His opposition to democracy in Northern Ireland and the Falklands is contrary to the views of the British public.

13. He has [hosted meetings in Parliament in which journalists who are pro-Israel were banned from attending](http://ukmediawatch.org/2010/07/30/richard-millet-and-jonathan-hoffman-banned-from-parliament/). An extreme misuse of government property.

14. Jeremy Corbyn MP has sponsored and signed a number of Early Day Motions in parliament that praise Interpal for its ""humanitarian work"" and condemn the ""damaging designation of Interpal"" as a terror-support organization. Interpal is led by [holocaust denier](http://www.thecommentator.com/article/4910/tell_the_truth_about_terrorism_and_islamic_charities) Ibrahaim Hewitt who has stated: ""Jews cannot be entrusted with the sanctity and security of this Holy Land."" ‚ÄúThe undeniable fact that the creation of the state (of Israel) is the prime cause of the unrest in the Middle East.‚Äù Oxfam pulled out of an event he was at, not because of his anti-semitic views but because he claims to want homosexuals to suffer ‚Äúsevere punishments‚Äù for their ‚Äúgreat sin.‚Äù Ibrahm Dar (Abu Hana), the Bradford representative of Interpal, is an open admirer of  Anwar Al-Awlaki, a major al-Qaeda leader whose main ambition is blow up U.S. planes.

Overall, he is strongly associated with people who hope for the death of British soldiers, with anti-Semites, with homophobes and with woman-haters. He claims to be left wing and liberal but his greatest foreign friends are some of the most right wing and illiberal regimes in the world.",null,0,null,1440933901,null,null,1440935330,0,cukngyz,null,t3_3iy0k9,null,null,null,t3_3iy0k9,null,null,null,1441583654,null,-6,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-6,null

null,null,Putin-U-Down,null,null,null,"&gt; Pearce often gets singled out because his opinions often (often not always) seem to be in staunch defence of Rodgers.

You won't be able to find me one other reputable journalist who has ever said negative things like Rodgers out. This is because journalists will never take a side unless forced too. There is a neutrality that sport journalists in particular write with. In fact i've been working recently with the local newspaper of Cardiff, the Echo. Most of the journo's there don't care for the manager Russell Slade, (as any fan will have an opinion) however they don't take the rhetoric of 'Slade Out!', they keep a neutrality for the sake of the fans.     

&gt; This combined with the fact that a local journalist like Pearce will only report what the club tells him makes it sound like everything he writes is essentially propoganda.

Completely wrong. Pearce reports like any reputable journalist is obligated to do - fairly and without bias. Here are some recent examples where he actually reports against what would be considered 'the Liverpool state of mind' 

- http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/liverpool-fc-0-3-west-9955264 
Check the section titled 'Rodgers' tactics will prompt questions' - certainly questioning the club and Rodgers.

- http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/balotelli-made-mistakes-liverpool-fc-9938417
This is an article where Pearce covers Balotelli's response to Rodgers way of football. In the article there is nothing like an objective opinion, only quotes. If Pearce was part of the so called 'propoganda', he could have easily not reported this, or made it into an editorial where he questions each of Balotelli's statements. He does neither.     
      
&gt; Firstly Echo writers are local so rely on those within the club for information

As does any other journalist working and football club, national or local. Your point doesn't mean anything - any reporter will rely on information from the club or those associated with the club. Football agents will talk to the Echo just as much as they would talk to the BBC or the Times. The densest collection of Liverpool fans is in, surprise, Liverpool - so it makes sense for anybody trying to change the fans opinion to talk to journalists working in said area.  

&gt; secondly due to the first point they don't want to upset those at the club by going against what they say (and thus souring their main source of news) 

As I have already pointed out there is quantifiable evidence that this isn't true. Not to mention Liverpool FC rely on local media as much as local media rely on Liverpool. The relationship just won't break down, they rely on each other too much. 

&gt; finally they know what the fans want to hear (ie. in the Raheem situation, they know that fans want to hear about how bad he is etc etc)

This is a point I would agree with you on, any journalist will report for the reader. But this point directly contradicts what you said earlier about Pearce being in staunch defence of Rodgers. Last season when we lost 6-1 to Stoke and the months that followed, almost everyone wanted Rodgers out. If Pearce was culpable of reporting what the fans wanted to hear, why wouldn't have he (and the Echo as a whole) jumped on the bandwagon and said 'Rodgers Out!' as their leading headline.


Sorry for the long post, I've just been studying journalism for some time now, and enjoy a  good debate about the ins and outs. Because like you said, it's not black and white and you can make a case for either side. However in this case, Pearce is certainly not actually doing anything wrong. He is just an easy target for those who have an anti-club agenda.

Benteke had next to service which was a result of our passing being so slow. If we are going to break these teams down we have to pass it quicker and get the ball moving with one touch incisive passes. Otherwise teams will just sit back and we will be useless, which has started to happen recently

I didn't think the midfield offered enough protection of the defence either. Lucas and Can didn't really do enough I felt. So yes Lovren was poor but so was Skrtel and Gomez.

There is no claim to make though, I've already said there is very little between them. I'm just telling you, as a fact, which of course you don't have to accept, that Liverpool like ANY club in the UK will give their local paper priority. 

You talk about reliability and yeah of course Pearce will get something wrong from time to time, but so will any journalist ever (that includes Barrett) in a world where things move so quickly no-one can ever be 100%. 
Not to mention Barrett doesn't only write as much about Liverpool - so the sample size is a lot smaller therefore it is hard to quantify.

Look, it's not a case of this is what I believe, this is what happens in sports journalism. Locals are given priority, they are considered the ones who attend the games therefore the ones who's opinion matters most. Thats just one reason why what I'm saying is true.

It's silly to argue over this, because end of the day this is a stone cold fact and if you don't want to agree or believe thats your call. Not to mention, the amount between Pearce and Barrett is so small its almost negligible. But there is room between them. 

I talk about my masters because I think it can act as some level of proof that I'm not just making shit up, I know how this works - in fact one day I'll be doing it.

I'm not saying he said it in the best way but I was with a large amount of people after last season, I don't think Rogers has done enough to stay on this season HOWEVER they backed him so I was happy enough to see how he did. He had a lot of money backing him, seems to have got all his targets and yet still the exact same problems linger on. 

I can count on 1 hand the number of times he has actually managed to change a game through a change of formation or subs. When we go behind I just honestly expect the worst. Since we lost the only player capable of making something out of nothing our attack has been so ridiculously laboured it is a joke. Strikers which have had good seasons elsewhere were suddenly unable to score here and rather than write it up as maybe something is wrong people are all too happy to just blame the strikers. 

He has had 4 games to show that he has learned lessons and so far hasn't shown a thing. I wanted him to learn with us, to grow into the job but honestly can you say that we are playing better now than when he took over? We accepted a poor first season as growing into his style, I would be all too happy to have a season adjusting to a style but here we are 3 years on and I honestly couldn't tell you what that style is. Really I think it just comes down to it not being a good fit, he's a young manager who definitely has potential but do we have time to let him make the mistakes before he lives up to it here?

* **Ivanovic &gt; Baba**. Pretty self explanatory. He was just as bad defensively last year but it was okay because our team overall was in great form and Ivanovic was scoring or creating. Now he's even worse defensively and he's not doing anything going forward either. Baba should be ready by next match and even if he's not completely ready, we can't afford to keep playing Ivanovic. It's suicidal.

* **Costa &gt; Kenedy or Remy**. May be a bold move, but Costa needs to stop complaining and looking for fouls. He probably would have gotten a penalty today if he didn't lose the benefit of the doubt after the previous PL matches he's played in.

Hahahaha. I love how you keep changing the criteria. James Pearce said 100% that Balotelli was staying ""beyond any doubt"". He put his name to that statement to what he believed was true.

&gt; There is no claim to make though, I've already said there is very little between them. I'm just telling you, as a fact, which of course you don't have to accept, that Liverpool like ANY club in the UK will give their local paper priority.

It's not a fact though, is it? A fact is something you can prove is true. You can't prove anything you're saying is true whereas I am backing up my claims with evidence. It's more of your own opinion which is wrong (as you can see by the way this thread has been downvoted).

&gt; You talk about reliability and yeah of course Pearce will get something wrong from time to time, but so will any journalist ever (that includes Barrett) in a world where things move so quickly no-one can ever be 100%. Not to mention Barrett doesn't only write as much about Liverpool - so the sample size is a lot smaller therefore it is hard to quantify.

Again, find me evidence where Barrett has got anything wrong in the past 8 months. You just can't because he hasn't got anything wrong in that time frame whereas Pearce has gotten multiple things wrong within the space of a few months.

&gt;Look, it's not a case of this is what I believe, this is what happens in sports journalism. Locals are given priority, they are considered the ones who attend the games therefore the ones who's opinion matters most. Thats just one reason why what I'm saying is true.

LMFAO. Barrett is a local journalist you cretin.

&gt; But there is room between them.

Yeah you're right with that, Barrett has been way ahead of Pearce since December of last year.

&gt; I talk about my masters because I think it can act as some level of proof that I'm not just making shit up, I know how this works - in fact one day I'll be doing it.

You are making shit up though. You're throwing the word ""embargo"" around when you don't even know when it's in effect. You're getting confused between what is a fact and what is an opinion too.

&gt; Whether you want to argue your opinion against actual fact or not is your call. But I'm done here

I don't know why this is so difficult to understand. Farage is leader of Ukip but isn't electable. Miliband won the Labour leadership but also wasn't electable. 

Look, the sad thing is you trust the media over a Labour MP's first hand account. If you knew anything about law or the constitution, parliamentary process etc it would be a no brainer which account was more reliable given what they each say. Corbyn always rebels because he's a moron. The timing was just right for it to kick off a storm this time around and play into his hands - possibly for the first time in his entire career. 

&gt; And how did that go?

Well like I said, **it would have passed anyway.** Voting against or rebelling for the sake of your principles or for the sake of PR stunt is literally facile in these circumstances. Much smarter to *at least* try and get aspects of it changed before the inevitability of it going through. 

&gt; Like it or not, Corbyn is doing something that hasn't been done since Blair in bringing people into the party, energising people, taking a stand.

If I'm honest I don't really care. I don't have a horse in this race and am not particularly political. I'm a lawyer so just enjoy analysing and arguing out the issues. 

The thing that we have yet to see is whether the kind of people that support Corbyn now and the type that he is energising are representative of the public. And if they will even stay with Labour if or when Corbyn fails. I suspect not, on both fronts. But we will just have to wait and see.

Putting Wiggins into that race rather than G showed where the focus was. British cycling was the Wiggins show and no one who disobeyed Brailsford was getting a look in whether it helped Team GB or not. Hence why Cav was basically forced to waste a year of his career at Sky with little to no support. 

To be fair to Wiggins, Cav started out with the same arrogance, he learned a lot riding for HTC and grew up a bit. Wiggins seems not to have felt personal growth was at all important. Another good example was his attempts to unsettle Froome before the Tour last year. He must have known he was never capable of riding it competitively, especially after his complete failure at the Giro but still decided to play on the media's lack of understanding of cycling by pushing comments on his attempts to make the team.

National security is a complicated issue. We can't pretend we have never fucked up on foreign policy issues and tried to 'impose our will' on people in other parts of the world. Recognising that and trying to address it is probably going to be *good* for national security. One of the main things that the US and the UK in particular need to realise going forward is that it isn't really so easy to go around the world jackbooting in other countries these days without getting some collateral damage back home. So we should very carefully weigh up why we interfere in the affairs of other countries. I don't for one second buy into us 'caring' about the people of Syria or Libya.

Barrett used to work in Liverpool for the echo. Now I imagine he's in London as he works for the Times. That ain't local. I don't know how old you are, but seriously, you don't understand. I'm sorry, you just don't. Go get some work experience for a local newspaper if you're interested in the subject, you'll learn a lot about the medium.

I'm not making shit up, embargo's exist all the time! Do you not believe that? Lets say someone said to a journalist 'x player wants to leave - but this is off the record'. That in itself is a vocal embargo. There are a fair few different types which I think is what has confused you. Embargo's are quite abstract that operate under a lot of different media laws, so arguing about them is really tough unless you know the letter of the law - which even I admit to not knowing (and there is no way you would know them either, unless you work in either Media Law or are an experienced journalist yourself). 

The concept of journalists being ahead of another doesn't make sense either. Honestly sports journalism does not work like that. In news and current affairs, yeah absolutely. Sport is different, as the same story tends to be read by one person in multiple ways (i.e. you would read a new signing story in the Echo, Times and the BBC) Of course, breaking a story first is appreciated, but especially online, they will tend to get clicks anyway - a lot of that is down to social media like Twitter which will share the same story by different people numerous times.   

I can't provide evidence that one is more reliable than the other, because from the hundreds of posts there is bound to be discrepancies on both sides, not to mention Barrett is behind a paywall and Pearce writes far more editorial pieces. No journalist is perfect, not one! All I can offer is an academic standpoint.

It's an abstract fact, I mean the only way I could prove to you that what I said is true is getting you to come along and talking to the professors who teach this type of thing in university. Obviously nowhere online is a direct statement saying how local papers are given priority - it's just one of the unwritten rules of sporting journalism. Journalism just doesn't work like that. It's really stupid for us to go back and forth because you don't know the information which puts us on different levels. I don't think you should just accept what I'm saying as fact though, after all I'm a stranger on the internet, who as far as you know could just lying to make a point! It's good to argue a point but genuinely if you were to study it, you would of course see things in a different light.  

I really can't offer you much more than that. It's ignorant to keep arguing. I know that facts I'm stating are right, and you obviously think your opinion is true, which is fine. I can't change that, which is a shame, but its what comes with debating, opinions will entrench the debater further into what they believe.

I can only speak from the UKs system, which is constantly criticised for being too complicated and failing to provide any relief to the that need it and too much advantage is given to those that don't need them. Tax credits don't incentivise people to work, because eventually when they find work their involvement with the government doesn't stop, and they still feel worthless. And when you work and get less than you'd get unemployed, you'll pick unemployment. 

The poverty are not crippled by the government support, our economy is. By the government masking the true cost of labour, for the very low earners, businesses will always use the excuse ""we can't afford to operate if you raise the minimum wage."" Let's face it, that's the line they've been running with since the introduction of the minimum wage and it's a surprise that many people still believe it. When in fact most companies can afford to take a 20% hit to their profits and still exist and exist quite successfully.

But the government and the public lose out, a welfare system that is suppose to look after the vulnerable, is used to help businesses seem more profitable. The welfare system is pre-occupied in supporting people that it shouldn't have to support and can't offer reflective service to those not in work. 

The biggest thing I don't understand with the U.S. minimum wage is that it's not age tiered. A lot of the arguments about having to pay teenagers more are understandable and easily navigated. Of course a teenager shouldn't earn $15 an hour, but an adult shouldn't earn what a teenager does. 

It's simple, business can afford to pay a more reasonable minimum wage and should. I doubt the loss of jobs would be huge but let's say it is, we will have a better idea about the number of people that businesses can't support. Essentially highlighting how many jobs we are short by. The government can then look at that demographic and think about what projects they could help with, infrastructure projects, data processing, lots of jobs that the government could source out to this demographic and a fair wage. Whatever is left, we can agree that there is no fair work for these people so they need government support, whether that's through your minimum income idea or through another way. 

Raising the minimum wage in the past has always yielded better results in the long term, raising it to something where anyone can live on their wage is something that should be aspirational and it will not kill business. Business needs to be done regardless of the cost of labour.

*  Azpi on the left kills the attack far too much, nearly every time he receives the ball he goes backwards and kills momentum. Not that that is entirely his fault, he isnt very good on his left. But because of that he makes less overlapping runs than he should. 

* Because Dave isnt making the width, Willian/Oscar have had to come the left when Hazard has the ball to try to make space for him. This compacts the pitch far too much and makes it hard to create chances. Thats why a lot of our half chances or out balls are from the left across the pitch to Iva or layoffs to Fab or Matic.

How is that fixed? Nothing ground breaking here but, start Baba on the left and bench Iva seems the most immediate fix. Id also like to see, just for a game or two, Jose keep the formation extremely rigid. Dont let Pedro and Hazard come inside looking for the ball and isolate them against the fullbacks and give Oscar the space to create.

As well as this, Tom Baker had two console rooms going at the one time (at one point during his tenure as The Doctor).

Peter Capaldi's console room - whilst very similar to Matt Smith's later console room; is different - so, in Idris terms, it would be a different console - as well as this, the console room is also slightly changing again this year.  

As well as that, there are a few Doctors who had the same console rooms; 1/2 4/5 (and i think 3 shared the same as 4/5); 9/10.  So; the console rooms don't necessarily change when The Doctor changes, they change when he fancies a change (a bit like wallpaper).  

However, often when The Doctor Regenerates, he feels like a new start, so does change things.  

That said, The Curator in the 50th suggested that he would have many regenerations.

null,null,JohnMulroy,num20,,null,"I agree with you about the ethos of our club and what we are trying to achieve but whether we win or lose, or qualify for CL means less and less to me every year.

Money has change the game and changed people expectations and understanding of what football is about. At its origins, football was just being with like minded people and belonging to a community. It was better than going to work.

Things are starting to change now because in the past you paid a tenner to go to match, but now you pay 40-50+. (ticket prices are a systemic issue across the whole PL not just an ENIC problem) The price fans pay creates a sense of entitlement that they paid their money they should only have to watch their team win. Its bullocks. You show up to support your team not to watch your team win. If i may point out the difference between home and away support. The away support tends to be more traditional tottenham fans, people who are just there to have a right fucking time and sing some songs. The away fans rarely slag off the team. Even when we are losing, they would rather sing something funny than just start coating off our players.

There's a video of Spurs fans singing 'Lets pretend we scored a goal' while we were losing, 4/5-0 to liverpool last year away. If that was at home, the hate, the boos, and the fans would be absolutely furious and they would probably leave early. To that I always think, you dont judge a fan when they celebrate a victory, you judge a fan when his team is down 0-4 at home. Thats when the real character comes out. What tottenham actually means to you. Does it mean winning, champions league and whatever Sky Sports wants to make you believe or is it more than that. 

Back to the reality of things mate. Like i was saying, Money has changed things in a competitive sense now as well. Short of an Arab prince coming in, Spurs are never going to qualify for the CL consistently or win the league in the next few years until the stadium comes. So getting worked up about not qualifying for the CL is rather silly. Of course i want spurs to as well as possible but it doesnt affect my enjoyment to the game too much. Im sure many people would agree with me on this, but i would rather have the team we have now finsihing 7-8 every year, than have some billionaire, who is wiling to spend heaps of money and buy some mercenaries. Those boys are part of tottenham. They were born just a few minutes from where you and i were born. 

The year we were relegated from the first division, the support for the club was never better. Can you imagine if the club was relegated now? Christ they would probably torch Levy's and Poch's office. 

Im sort of all over the place here mate but the point im trying to show you is that at its heart, even before Bill Nic came, football was just about getting together with mates and having a laugh. Wanting to be a competitive team and always being in europe, which we are, are great and show what we strive to do. Thats why we buy the talent we buy and invest the money in youth, but it should never be the end all of football. 

Because i probably explained this like shite, listen to the last episode of THe fighting cock. Flav gives a great explanation of this.

Yeah, I mean, there is no such thing as causality. People's actions are basically random, especially terrorists. They are just as likely to perpetrate acts of terror against the UK or Iceland. There is definitely no link between UK foreign policy in the Middle East and the motivation for Islamic terrorists to target us.

&gt;Personally, I'm a fan of the idea that people are responsible for their own actions. That if you make the choice to kill innocent people, then it's nobody's fault, but your own.

&gt; The Government has responded to the petition you signed ‚Äì ‚ÄúMake the production, sale and use of cannabis legal.‚Äù.

&gt;Government responded:

&gt;Substantial scientific evidence shows cannabis is a harmful drug that can damage human health. There are no plans to legalise cannabis as it would not address the harm to individuals and communities.

&gt;The latest evidence from the independent Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs is that the use of cannabis is a significant public health issue (‚ÄòCannabis Classification and Public Health‚Äô, 2008).

&gt;Cannabis can unquestionably cause harm to individuals and society. Legalisation of cannabis would not eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade, nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence and the misery that this can cause to families.

&gt;Legalisation would also send the wrong message to the vast majority of people who do not take drugs, especially young and vulnerable people, with the potential grave risk of increased misuse of drugs. 

&gt;Despite the potential opportunity offered by legalisation to raise revenue through taxation, there would be costs in relation to administrative, compliance and law enforcement activities, as well as the wider costs of drug prevention and health services.

&gt;The UK's approach on drugs remains clear: we must prevent drug use in our communities; help dependent individuals through treatment and wider recovery support; while ensuring law enforcement protects society by stopping the supply and tackling the organised crime that is associated with the drugs trade. The Government will build on the Drugs Strategy by continuing to take a balanced and coherent approach to address the evolving challenges posed.

&gt;There are positive signs that the Government‚Äôs approach is working: there has been a long term downward trend in drug use over the last decade, and more people are recovering from their dependency now than in 2009/10. The number of adults aged 16-59 using cannabis in the last year in England and Wales has declined over the last decade from 9.6% to 6.7%, with cannabis use amongst young adults aged 16-24 and young people aged 11-15 following a similar pattern.

Of those 3 things, not one of those was up to scratch for a first team player. As I said, he was effectively ball watching most of the game, hardly made a single tackle, often lost his man, lost his composure towards the end and his passing accuracy for anything going forward was poor at best (as it has been for the last few games he's played). 

Comparatively, Rose, Vert, Dier, Ali and Dembele all played well and it sort of emphasised Bentaleb's nervousness to go forward and his lack of positional awareness because they were all so on point.

He is a bit more of a risk because he actually goes in and tries to make a play whereas i feel Skrtel lets play happen in front of him far too much (perfect example is the 3rd goal yesterday). There was an incident in one of the games this year where there was a bit of miscommunication between Milner and Skrtel in clearing the ball from our area. I feel that happens more often with Skrtel. 

However the best endorsement as to why Lovren is in the team currently? He played no part in the 6-1 thrashing by Stoke.

null,null,TotallyNotAnIntern,null,null,null,"Tax credits were designed so the marginal rate of tax on any job would be below 100% in all but some pretty extreme circumstances where you shouldn't work anyway (disabled parents, single parents who are also carers for very ill relatives etc). So nobody has been discouraged to work since you'd practically always earn more if you did.

You keep talking about how it's 'demoralising' to get state help, but it's morally exactly the same as using the NHS or even driving on public roads or visiting public parks. The reason it's 'demoralising' is because the press keep besmirching the good name of the working classes, not because welfare or socialism in moderation are by any means bad things.

The minimum wage has a real statistical link to increased unemployment especially among the youth and ethnic minorities and other disadvantaged groups: http://www.adamsmith.org/wp-content/uploads/Minimum_Wage.pdf I'd imagine it's even worse among single mothers, but tax credits are non-discriminatory in their wealth redistribution.

The economy is not crippled by tax credits, GDP is massively increased by additional income to the working poor (the IMF have a report on this) whereas if we simply refunded the taxes used to pay for the tax credits the GDP would grow much more slowly, the rich don't spend their money they hoard it, which is why they're rich. 

I'm not arguing against a minimum wage, i'm arguing that subsidising and offering hyper-progressive taxation to the working poor is the best incentive to work and boosts the economy more than lower taxes ever would.

No argument against the red card as far as I'm aware, two blatant yellows right in front of where I was sat.
Clearly Koeman had had a word about the long ball football as the entire team were keen to keep it down today, which is lucky because the people around me were baying for blood the moment the ball got off the floor.

My two main things from the match today are.

Ward-Prowse must start every game. He was fan-fucking-tastic today. Offensively very good at keeping the ball moving both with short ground passes and with beautiful cross field (first time!) balls. Defensively he put in a very good shift making sure he was talking the entire game, he is (as we all know) our future captain. Real coming of age game imo. Now he needs to do it against 11 men.

Tadic is a fantastic player when he's on the left! We've been screaming it at Koeman since he arrived and finally he relented and shoved Tadic back to the left. In the last 10 minutes he moved to the right and was noticeably worse. (I called this in the pre-match thread, but then who didn't?).

I actually used ticketbis a few weeks ago for the Bournemouth match. Like you, my decision to use ticketbis vs. the official ticketing process was largely motivated by the desire to get good seats. For those of us who don't live in the immediate vicinity, trips to Anfield can be rare and hard to come by - so naturally, it makes sense to try to get the best seats possible in either the Kop or lower Main/Centenary. Beyond that, I had the misfortune of attending the match/being in Liverpool with a Chelsea fan who obviously had no interest in signing up for a shiny new LFC membership.

In terms of the process, it was pretty straightforward and clean. Ticketbis simply intermediates between sellers and buyers. In this case, I was buying seats from a season ticket/card holder. The cards were left in an envelope at the front desk of my hotel with clear instructions about how to use them, what to say if someone asked where I got them, and how to return them when I was done (put them back in the envelope and leave them with the front desk at checkout). All in all, it was a seamless process and I got exactly the seats I was promised with no hassle. Of course, as with any website that does not directly hold their own inventory and relies on the good faith of both counterparties (same with StubHub or SeatGeek), you may or may not have similar results. However, I will say that ticketbis is fairly responsive and does a good job of ensuring that both parties meet their end of the agreement; they were proactive in ensuring that I both received the tickets and had properly left them behind for pickup. If the seller had not acted in good faith, I'm not sure what the outcome would have been - but I imagine that you'd get a refund, at a minimum, if not an alternate set of tickets.

Proof from the match (feel free to DM me if you want to see the confirmation on the website): http://imgur.com/bvx860M

* Romeu is a fucking bargain. Pains me to say it as he's one of my favorite Saints, but Big Vic who? 

* Cedric looked like the Cedric we were promised, slightly suspect defensively but fantastic getting forward and put multiple dangerous crosses into Pelle. For a guy up field so much he didn't seem to get caught out today either. His fitness and workrate seem to be very good: if he's caught out he definitely gets back. I have a feeling when Bertrand comes back teams will stop forcing it down the left side though and he may not be allowed the same offensive freedom. 

* Yoshi and Fonte weren't challenged, which is good given how crap they were midweek. I honestly don't know what to think of Steks yet because he really hasn't had anything to do very often. 

* Tadic/Pelle/Mane/JWP were all fantastic, Tadic and JWP in particular. I get starting Davis but Koeman definitely made the right decision sacrificing him for Jay at half given our man advantage. Think JWP should be getting Davis' minutes (or Vic's, I guess) given his performance today. 

All in all, I'm happy for once. I know it's *just* Norwich and they were down a man, but that was very convincing.

Training in FE (Further Education) is a different pathway and course. It doesn't just cover A-Levels, it covers all adult education except for Uni Lecturing. (Also qualifies you to teach GCSE.)   

The difference is, you do *not* qualify with QTS (Qualified Teacher Status), which is what you need for Primary and High School.  

If you change your mind after it and want to go into Primary or High, you would have to pay a few hundred quid for QTLS.

I'll agree that 25K is probably a reasonable guestimate within the bounds of inner London. You'll find most starting teachers earn less. Around 20-22K is ""normal"" for a NQT I believe. According to [this](http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/teaching/how-much-do-teachers-earn), teacher pay starts at ¬£21K and goes up to ¬£37K before you have to stop being a teacher and become management.

Hardly rewarding.

&gt; What kind of careers in music pay ¬£50-60k a year? 

For someone starting out, earning that much requires that you invest a *lot* of time into your work. I won't be earning that much for a few years (unless I pick up some of the positions I'm interviewing for over the next few weeks, but that's a different story...) but even just with what I'm doing I'll be earning more than NQTs. Which is incredibly depressing when you think that apart from my degree, my best skill is really my ability to convince anyone that spends more than 5 minutes in a room with me that they should really hire me to do something that they haven't even thought about hiring someone to do yet.

Within classical music, most musicians won't really get up to 50-60K if I'm being honest. If you're *just* a performer and you *just* do orchestral concerts where you're like.. seventh string violin, then expect to be on about ¬£20K/year. A top violinist in a good orchestra will be on ¬£50K/year. But the careers that require ancillary skills (teaching, sightreading, harmonisation, score reading, accompanying, etc.) tend to earn more, and the management positions (musical directors, mostly) are on more again.

There's kind of career paths in music, but it's more about developing your own skills to advance your own career path than it is following one that anyone else has made.

To answer your question, in any case:

* Private teaching is about ¬£80/hour in some parts of London. You can realistically do about 25-30 hours of teaching a week and it's normally around 30-35 weeks of the year. Do the maths, be incredibly depressed as you realise that successful private teachers verge on 80K+. Even at half of that as an hourly rate, you're looking at earning ¬£30-40K/year.
* Accompanying auditions, concerts, etc. can be a nice money spinner. Varies person by person, client by client, but if you think that an exam season might be ¬£200-300/day (¬£25-40/exam, 10 exams a day: not an unreasonable guestimate though it's complicated^TM ), 5 days of the week, 20 weeks of the year, and that's 30K by itself. And if you're pulling in that much accompanying graded exams I *guarantee* that you'll also be working the other 32 weeks of the year in places. If you have that many clients then yeah. You're basically set. As a side note, I've earnt as much as ¬£400 for a 45 minute concert. Short notice (48 hours) and I came recommended by a friend who told them to make me an offer so high I couldn't say no. This is unusual (it worked out at about ¬£50/hr after rehearsals + practice) , but it does happen.
* Playing for studio recordings can be ¬£220-500/day, depending on difficulty, how much you're doing, how good you are, how good you are at bullshitting about how good you are. Commissioned recordings can be pretty well paid, but tend to be less per hour because you actually have to learn the parts. Playing for professional theatre is ¬£800-1100+/week, sometimes more: a friend of mine earnt a year's rent by playing all shows for a pantomime in her local city, though that was horrifyingly well paid and we all secretly hate her. Even amateur theatre is ¬£300-600/week if you're not letting them rip you off, though you normally only *get* one or two weeks for an amateur show compared to much longer stints for professional shows. Sometimes you get royalties thrown in for recordings, sometimes they buy the royalties off of you. People new to the job earn significantly less, of course, and generally have to go jumping through hoops (and cruise ship contracts) to get the decent shore jobs.
* Directing *amateur* choirs and orchestras and bands goes up to ¬£120/rehearsal. Directing *professional* groups has a increase in pay. You can easily do 2 different groups each night (if you have sufficient groups to run and are willing to accept the occasional schedule clash), but even just doing one group a night (2 hours a rehearsal, 5 nights a week, 35 weeks of the year) is going to push you towards 30K/year.

I could continue and explore other areas, but you get the gist.  And, of course, if you missed it: teaching, studio/session recording, composing all share a completely different time slot to theatre work, directing work and so on.

So yeah. There's high paid work out there in music, frankly I've found that most musicians have a salary directly proportional to their ability to sell themselves... you have to have the skills, the drive and the confidence to go for the big bucks and, more than that, you have to be able to rebound every time you fail and take failure as a means by which to further develop yourself. I don't think I've ever gone into an interview and not walked out of it with at *least* occasional work from the company, and if you get enough occasional work then it's regular work anyway. It just makes my timetable a mess.

Diversity of skills, repertoire and musical knowledge is what makes a musician successful in the sense of ""consistently earning large amounts"" (well, that and personality, networking and other stuff like that). But if you consider that a teacher's working week is [50-60 hours](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-27087942)? I'll take ""earning more than an NQT whilst working many less hours"" for ""not hating my life"".

Though I may be an aberration. I'd guess that most successful musicians earn ¬£30-40K but a lot of the recent graduates around my age are on ¬£15-20K/year at the minute and don't look to be increasing it despite working 30-40 hour weeks. Which is bizarre but I can't complain because it means a few are starting to edge towards the agency I'm establishing and that means commission for me. Yay!

&gt;I've always thought that getting a music degree was a niche thing that one did for enjoyment or personal accomplishment rather than for career purposes.

A lot of people go into a music degree without a firm plan of what to do *after* their degree. Hence they never really earn any money and end up doing something else because they never knew what to do with their degree. It's a common issue, because musicians rarely pass work around outside of their friends, so unless your friends are the people with the work you're not going to get it.

I'll admit that I know very few people who go into music without enjoying it a *lot* though. The work tends to vary between quiet weeks where you'll be working 10-20 hours and then busy weeks where you'll be working 80-90 hours. If you can't put up with the busy weeks then you aren't going to be able to survive professionally because you just won't earn enough.",null,0,null,1440948326,null,null,1440948595,0,cuksz98,null,t3_3iwgzb,null,null,null,t1_cukopwn,null,null,null,1441586250,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

null,null,agentdcf,flair8,,null,"I don't know if people have run the numbers for football, but in hockey this is ABSOLUTELY the case. Goals are essentially random outcomes within the realm of possibilities created by chances, and both teams and players will convert those chances are pretty similar rates. Obviously there are players with greater skill in this department--strikers will be better finishers than defenders, on average--but the differences aren't so great as to make some players or teams able to score much more consistently from much lower quality opportunities. The differences among teams are marginal. 

Now, in football, there isn't quite the same skill parity that exists across the National Hockey League, so the differences may be greater. The individual abilities of attacking players for Manchester City are significantly better than those for Norwich, for example, so this may be slightly less true of football than it is of hockey. Still, though, the really crucial stats for *predicting* success, and not merely *describing* it, are chances created. If you're creating more scoring chances and limiting your opponents' chances, it means that you're controlling the game in ways that are repeatable. It means you're playing the right way. If you're merely scoring more goals than your opponent, you may be getting the points in the table, but it's not necessarily repeatable since the goals themselves are more luck than anything else. 

In other words, the people saying that Spurs need to ""learn to take their chances"" or ""be more clinical"" are really just saying that Spurs need to be luckier. And honestly, the first four matches this season have been frustrating, but I'd much rather have us playing better but not getting the results rather than scraping out results we don't deserve. The former suggests that we'll be successful in the long run, the latter does not. Michael Caley, @MC_of_A, does a lot of advanced stats for us, and so far our xG (expected goals) over the four games is 6.5, while our xG allowed is just 3.5.

null,null,planetoiletsscareme,null,null,null,"Stekelenberg - Not really challenged but a couple of good stops

Yoshida - Great covering and clearances

Fonte - A couple of good stops

Targett - Arguably his best game, held his position well and wasn't fooled by a fake out resulting in a vital clearance

Cedric - Started off more defensively and became more attacking as the minutes ticked on, exactly what he needs to do. Linked up with Mane very well

Romeu - IMO our best signing. Absolutely brilliant from start to finish. Interceptions and passing on point. Works well with the team.

Davis - Supported the midfield well as he always does, the natural one of the 3 midfielders to be taken off for J Rod

Ward-Prowse - I keep banging on about him and today showed why. Absolute cracker of a free kick very early on in the game. He's constantly engaging with the players and improving them even when he's nowhere near the ball. Pelles goal was due to a quality interception from him and he defended excellently too. As others have said I think he will be our natural captain once Fonte departs. Absolutely HAS to be a starting XI, over any other possible attacking Midfielders.

Tadic - Much better on the left, much more creative. He acted like a bit of a dick a couple of times but I can't complain as he for once managed to get on the end of a low ball cross which we always seem to mess up. His best game for a long time

Pelle - Much more convincing from him today, a couple of really nice head ons to others (including a setup for Tadic that he probably should have scored). The second goal was basically his as well as the first. Looked much happier today after he scored like he always does.

Mane - As mentioned earlier worked well with Cedric and was dancing his way around a few players. You could sense his frustration at not scoring but a couple of assists is a very good performance.

J Rod - Good idea bringing him on to switch to a 4-2-4 at half time. A decent game I felt from him, a couple of balls that had he got on the end of would have been great. Overall slightly above average performance

Martina - Wasn't on for long at all but showed a good workrate even though we were 3-0 up, can't complain

Juanmi - Again brings so much energy to the attack when he's brought on, and was covering back very well too. I think he could be a very potent 60/70 min sub in a game that is level to spicen up the attack

Johnson might be worth a punt in the more physical games, but in the first three games, the midfield players all contributed and it's difficult to see where Johnson will fit in the team without injuries.

By all means report back with your findings. I can't check right now, or this reply would just be an image.

Edit: Also meant to add in the first reply that Skrtel's mistakes hardly go unnoticed here and there's plenty more than a whisper about him. It's just rarely backed up. Obviously he's not the world's best, or anything, but he's been our most reliable defender for quite a bit.

Edit2: Just so the connotation or content of what I'm saying isn't misconstrued and to hark back to OP, I think we *should* offer our support to Lovren in times of need, after bad games and just in general. Players have bad games, and defenders look the worst when they have a bad one.

&gt;Yes the British army is personally responsible for every Iraqi killed

Not something I claimed, nor something that anyone has claimed at any point.

&gt;whom the left is so intent on marking out as 'good for stability' ignoring that he gassed thousands of Kurds

Citation needed. Who on the left said this, when and why? Was it during or after the Al-Anfal campaign? Who was it who supplied the weapons required to wage that campaign [in the first place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Iraq_during_the_Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_war) in order to prop up Iraq for the sake of 'regional stability'?

&gt;ISIS and the various militias which are only as powerful as they are because we withdrew from Iraq on the whim of short-sighted 'muh pacifism' the left is promoting.

It's actually impossible to envisage the existence of ISIS without the Iraq War. The fusion of Baathists with Salafists, who prior to the Iraq War despised each other, was a result of the conditions of the occupation and the repression of the Sunni population by the Shia dominated governments put in place by Britain and the US. Coalition forces left Iraq because they were not permitted to stay [by the Iraqi government](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/21/iraq-rejects-us-plea-bases). There was no 'stab in the back' by 'the left' although I'm sure that various leftists will be amazed that they are able to exercise such hegemony over the government of the United States.

&gt;As for Central Asian dictatorships, mildly entertaining people are calling a guy who took a direct hand in destroying two of the modern age's most brutal dictatorships a supporter of them,

It's not really in dispute, is it? Blair [works](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120691/tony-blair-does-pr-repressive-azerbaijan-kazakhstan-autocracies) for the governments of Central Asian dictatorships and has become rich while doing it.

&gt;all while constantly harping about how 'great for stability' Assad, Saddam, Gaddaffi, etc are/were 

Who was saying this exactly? 'The Left' is pretty diverse, so we have Galloway today or the WRP in the 80s but there are plenty of people on the left who are not and a good number on the right who are. The SWP, for example, has taken a pretty pro-revolution line on Syria but most of the focus of the left in the past couple of years has been on support for the YPG in Rojava.

In the case you've mentioned where the suspects were identified as Pakistani it's different because they were caught and we know a lot more about their background - not the case here. Also, in the grooming cases generally both terms were used - Asian and Pakistani to describe the men, with Pakistani being used more as we found out more about the suspects. If you wanted to get more specific you could reference them being of Mirpuri descent to avoid lumping them in the same category as Lahori Pakistanis. 

I've also seen plenty of people who complain about the child exploitation gangs being described as ""Asian"" because it lumps them in with Indians and (apparently) Chinese more than happy to refer to them as ""Muslim gangs"" despite the fact the majority of Muslims in the UK aren't Pakistani. Makes their intentions suspect.

null,null,Thehunterforce,null,null,null,"I have to disagree partial with you. Ofcourse we're bound to have quality players in the team or else we wouldnt be able to win the title. But we need to scale it for what the clubs ambition is. We want to win the title and have a run for the CL trophy. Right now, when you look around Europe, you have some serious powerhouse we just can't compete with. Yes Courtois is in the top tier of goalkeepers. Our defense? In my opinion it is mediocore. Most of our offensive players have a lot of responsibilities to protect our back 4, which makes it a lot easier to look good. However, we conceded 32 goals and 'only' kept 17 clean sheets in the league. Our 2010 had 18 clean sheets and conceded 32 goals but they were more offensive and scored 103 goals in the league compared to the 73 our 2015 team did. 

What I ment was, when you look back those 5 years, everything was quality. You had J. Cole and Malouda who terrorized any defender where as, now we only have Hazard who does it. And if it didn't worked out for them, then we had Anelka or Kalou. Willian is way to passive and just never goes in to make the threat to the goal. If Hazard and Willian isn't playing or are performing badly, who is there really to replace them?Iam going to leave Pedro out because he just signed and has played 2 games and it isn't fair to make a judgement so shortly. 

Same can be said with the central midfield. Back then, Lampard Essien and Ballack. If they didn't perform at the top level we would have Deco to put on. Our current team? Oscar is injured and it is a castatrophe in the center midfield.

If you had to make an all star XI with every player in the world right now, how many Chelsea players would be in that (without being biased ofc)? Matic has a good change of making it and Hazard would probably make the bench. Else I just think there are so many other players who are above the rest of our team. Our 2010 team would have atleast a couple of players on that team. So to me, our squad is not in a competitive spot for what the club actually wants.

Firstly, it fails to acknowledge that men and women *really are different*. Prior to the leg-eating incident, your climbers were all interchangeable. That's not the case with the sexes, where there is an irreducible difference. Beyond that there are socially constructed differences between the sexes that many people see value in. Well-intentioned people can disagree on where the boundaries lie between social &amp; physical differences, and on how desirable it is to erase the socially constructed differences.

Secondly, your analogy fails to acknowledge that there might come a time when sexual discrimination is finally a thing of the past. Your unfortunate climber cannot grow a new leg, but sexual discrimination *can* be completely overcome.

Together these two flaws neatly encapsulate the problem with treating this issue as black and white: We need to be discussing what a world without sexual discrimination will look like, so that we can *recognise it when we achieve it.* The most radical feminists will necessarily be dissatisfied by that outcome, because other reasonable people will want to preserve more sexual differences than they would like.

My issue with all of this is that I don't think people are being sincere when it comes to reporting about these Sharia courts.

null,null,TrickyDickNixonbot,,Cooper Trooper,null,"&gt; Not something I claimed, nor something that anyone has claimed at any point.

Sorry I thought your implication that Blair is directly responsible for killing Iraqis, and not ISIS and Saddam Hussein, meant that. Only with the left can killing people you didn't kill be attributed to you because mental gymnastics. 

&gt; Citation needed. Who on the left said this, when and why? Was it during or after the Al-Anfal campaign? Who was it who supplied the weapons required to wage that campaign in the first place[1] in order to prop up Iraq for the sake of 'regional stability'?

The US gave weapons to Saddam Hussein almost 20 years before the events we were discussing, whom at the time the US could not have possibly foreseen doing what he did later, nor could've removed because the conditions for a regime change did not exist in the slightest. It made sense to back Saddam against Soviet-favoured Iran. I find this a relatively ironic argument considering its regularity, the US should've gone against Saddam then, but later when we had the ability to remove him and did, it was imperialism? Make up your mind, should we oppose these dictatorships or shouldnt we?

&gt; It's actually impossible to envisage the existence of ISIS without the Iraq War. The fusion of Baathists with Salafists, who prior to the Iraq War despised each other, was a result of the conditions of the occupation and the repression of the Sunni population by the Shia dominated governments put in place by Britain and the US. Coalition forces left Iraq because they were not permitted to stay by the Iraqi government[2] . There was no 'stab in the back' by 'the left' although I'm sure that various leftists will be amazed that they are able to exercise such hegemony over the government of the United States.

Its also impossible to imagine the existence of ISIS without the US/UK withdrawal of troops. While the left's solution is 'leave a brutal genocidal dictator in place for stability to prevent ISIS' (something you literally just claimed nobody argues, then proceeded to argue lmao), the sane solution is to remove Saddam while the conditions for regime change existed, and secure that change effectively rather than leaving the job half finished like we did. 

Also that link you cited from The Guardian does not say what you say it says, we made the decision to leave Iraq, not the Iraqi government. Although at the time the Iraqi government believed it was secure enough to maintain itself, our own military high command and a variety of politicians were warning otherwise, and whadya know, what they were saying would happen, happened. Now we have ISIS. Great job pacifists. 

As for your claims of 'Shia governments', you're the one arguing keeping Saddam Hussein in power so this is somewhat ironic, in addition to the fact that Iraq's government (thanks to le evul west) was *democratically elected* and the Iraqi constitution [contains provisions for the protection of ethnic minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Iraq#Regions). Gosh darn us evil Westerners, should've let Saddam stay in power and gas the Kurds for stability amirite XDDD

Oh, and yes, anti-war protests and response to voters does in fact exercise large amounts of influence on the actions of governments. The same happened in Vietnam and Cambodia back in the day, that led to Pol Pot which im sure you also think was good for stability or something.

&gt; It's not really in dispute, is it? Blair works[3] for the governments of Central Asian dictatorships and has become rich while doing it.

Jeremy Corbyn works directly with Hamas and Hezbollah, but does not share their beliefs according to you people. I have family members working for the Chinese government, they are not raging Communists but make a fairly good salary, they perform civilian services, much like Blair is trying to get a fucking pipeline built. Whats your proposal, we just let gas prices shoot through the roof and allow a Russian monopoly? Im sure thats good for stability too.

&gt; Who was saying this exactly? 'The Left' is pretty diverse, so we have Galloway today or the WRP in the 80s but there are plenty of people on the left who are not and a good number on the right who are. The SWP, for example, has taken a pretty pro-revolution line on Syria but most of the focus of the left in the past couple of years has been on support for the YPG in Rojava.

Everyone saying ""oh dont intervene, dont do anything, we shouldnt've touched Libya, Syria, Iraq, etc"". Not doing anything when something can be done is the direct acknowledgement that these governments are apparently the best option to remain in power. Im sorry but this is how it works. Im sure once again though, mass-repression and genocidal tendencies is okay for stability or something.

Lmao the YPG fetishism mention, cant go 2 seconds without deluded socialists jerking off to the YPG.

The purpose of the project is to install Solar Panels. As Kuumba Imani is partly funded by the Council and next year there will be big cuts to ""non-staturory provision"" they need to find way to boost their coffers. So, sticking solar panels on their roof would do two things. First it would provide them with electricity to use and so reduce their costs. Second it would provide them with a stable source of financial support for 25 years.

So what is being asked is for you to follow the link and vote for Kuumba Imani to get funded. To be honest, there are other projects in and around Liverpool. If you look around the site then you will find them. If any of those appeal to you more than the Kuumba Imani project then please vote for them instead.

Kuumba Imani has helped to provide Writers Workshops, help to start up businesses and even Health Training to the community.

All I've seen really are the highlights, and any time he did anything of note it was centrally.
He was garbage on the wing last season (and I don't just mean at wing back) and only looked half decent when playing centrally.

He doesn't look like he has the burst of acceleration to beat a player face on (with more of a galloping pace that's good for attacking on the break), he doesn't look like he has the skill to beat them, and he doesn't seem particularly good at crossing.
He doesn't seem willing to take players on when they're isolated either, but that could be down to confidence.

His qualities seem to suggest he's a good attacking mid for a counter-attacking team and possibly a backup number 10, with the ability to run at players centrally and link with the attack or pick out short passes over or behind the defence.",null,0,null,1440952551,null,null,false,0,cukv9x2,null,t3_3iy7vr,null,null,null,t1_cukuohb,null,null,null,1441587397,null,1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Tomorrw was also really good though quite unsettling, my partner's grandfather has severe dementia so it hit quite close to home. Was really well done.

Think my favourite show was actually Lanark last night. 4 hours in the theatre but it was pretty much perfect. The level of ambition in putting a book like Lanark on stage was matched by their execution and David Grieg's dialogue was, as always, sharp and witty. 

Didn't see those other ones, I actually made some pretty awful choices this year, Light Boxes was one that was well staged, well acted and would have been good of not for the choice of source material. Didn't do my research, the book it's based on is utterly self indulgent and the show grated.

The problem with grey squirrels is that they have a net destructive effect on woodlands. Grey squirrels are able to eat seeds like hazel nuts and acorns before they are fully mature, preventing their competitors from foraging, and to an extent slowing down the growth of woodland (although woodland growth is more likely to occur through cloning rather than germination of seeds, particularly in Hazel and Oak). 

The best way to deal with the grey squirrel problem would be to re-introduce pine martins. In areas with pine martin populations, such as the scottish highlands, there are generally also high populations of red squirrels. This is because red squirrels are adapted to the threat of pine martins; they are small and nimble, so can get to the ends of branches, safe from predation. 

Grey squirrels on the other hand lack the adaptation to pine martins. They are relatively slow and sluggish, making them an ideal target for pine martins.

They naturally coppice trees, prolonging their life and clearing up the understory, allowing insect eating birds and bats to hunt more effectively. They slow down rivers, creating more effective nursery pools for salmon hatchlings, and so a better environment for birds like Kingfishers. The slower water also increases the number of flying insects, again aiding the populations of bats and insectivorous birds. Furthermore, slower water means flushed ground, which means more willow and alder and so a more diverse woodland.

null,null,GreyShuck,tom-baker,Tom Baker,null,"Ah, that gets more interesting.

If we assume that a) the Daleks in *The Dalek Invasion of Earth* were in the same, unaltered, timeline (and there's no evidence that they had time travel themselves by then) and b) that they were the same strain of Daleks (and the casings appear to be the same - lacking the energy grid plates on the side) and c) that the Doctor was correct in his statement that the Earth Invasion was ""millions"" of years before their first encounter, then it seems that they were, or had been aware of life on other worlds before the Doctor's initial arrival.

Now, any of those assumptions might be false, however, it seems likely that they had made some impact beyond Skaro prior to the Doctor's arrival for the Time Lords to have become aware of them and experimented with them in the Death Zone.

There is a theory that all the Daleks that we see later on - those with the energy grid plates - were the Davros creations, and it was they who moved out to other worlds, leaving Skaro to the mutants, who eventually became the ""naturally"" occurring Daleks. They then found experimental Mk 1 or Mk 2 travel machines (afterall the Mk3s that we see in *Genesis of the Daleks* already have these plates) and adapted them for their own purposes. If so, then it is possible that these ""natural"" Daleks didn't know anything of of other worlds, but that the Davros Daleks had already created empires. That still doesn't quite explain the non-plated Daleks on Earth though.

Alternatively the Doctor could have been guessing when he mentioned the relative time placements (but again, the plates on the Daleks in GotD?)

It is certainly stated that Davros was not aware of other worlds in GotD, but it seems highly likely that the Daleks had already been playing with their own history themselves by that point for the Time Lords to have been concerned enough to have sent the Doctor on this mission.

I want to sell off my first build or possibly salvage some pieces but first I want to check what people think its worth.

Fx 6350 cpu. (box)
R9 290X Tri-x oc gpu. (no box)
m5a78l-m/usb3 motherboard (box is torn)
H55 water cpu cooler. (box)
16 gb (4x4) hyper x fury white 1866 ram. (boxes, 2 2x4 kits)
TP link wdn3200 (has 5ghz wifi connection so worth it, box)
razer blackwidow ulitmate mechanical keyboard (planning to get the corsair strafe silenced mx keys, this comes with box).
Dead silence cubed black case. (box but lost a few screws)
2 af 120 purple led fans (box)
Corsair cs650w psu semi modular. (maybe box)
1 seagate barracuda 1tb hdd.
1 64gb sandisc plus ssd
1 samsung 850 evo 120 gb ssd
1 250 gb ssd plus sandisk (still not used, might save for next build, might not sell 850 evo either but yeah all ssds have boxes.)
All been set up since april but I'm not too impressed with amd cpu and the case, been wanting to build itx. Got a planned build already..http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/gP7GTW

&gt; You really aren't painting us in a very good light here.

There's no ""us"" here, you're a loyalist reactionary who masquerades as a Celtic fan, I'm a Celtic fan.

&gt; Last I checked we were set up on charitable foundations by four monks in 1888

I wonder what they'd have thought of your talk of ""benefits scroungers"" 

&gt; not by the IRA

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Davitt

Probably because the IRA didn't exist in 1888. Celtic is an Irish Republican club, has always been an Irish Republican club, and will always be an Irish Republican club. 



&gt; People who felt a great debt of gratitude to our country for taking them in and making them part of our country. 

People who only ended up in ""our country"" because ""our country"" oppressed, starved, and murdered them. I'm sure they felt a great debt to the people publishing reports titled ""The Menace of the Irish Race to our Scottish Nationality""

&gt; People like you brought ugly sectarianism to our club, it wasn't founded on it. We have a lot to be proud of in our history, don't subvert it for your own narrative.

Hahaha ""if you know your history..."" eh?

It is not sectarian to resist militarism, it is not bigoted to be an Irish republican.

&gt; You will find a lot of people who voted No

No you won't ""Celtic supporter"" and ""loyalist"" are mutually exclusive. You cannot be a Celtic supporter and simultaneously be loyal to the British state. 

&gt; and a lot of people who vote for something other than SNP at the stadium every weekend.

Good the Celtic support should be suspicious of the pro-monarchy, pro-nato, Offensive Behaviour act SNP.

&gt;Neville Southall spent 18 years at Everton, becoming a club legend. He led the club to two championships and cup victories including a European Cup. In 2004 he was voted by the fans as one of the greatest heroes in the club's history. He's the last goalkeeper to have won the English footballer of the year award. This year, a new version of his noteworthy biography ""The Binman Chronicles"" was released.                       

&gt;**Neville Southall, you're a legend at Everton. But is it true that you very nearly joined Fortuna D√ºsseldorf?**

&gt;Well, ""very nearly"" is a big of an exaggeration. I was 14 and we travelled with my Welsh regional club for a friendly in D√ºsseldorf. Afterwards my uncle came to me and said ""they'd like to have you. Do you want to stay?"". It was totally bizarre.

&gt;**Was your uncle the coach?** 

&gt;Yes, officially. But he didn't have the slightest idea about tactics and so on.  He just made sure there were eleven of us on the pitch. You have to imagine the  scene in D√ºsseldorf: He didn't ask me if I wanted to go there at some time. If I'd said ""yes"", the others would have travelled back home and I'd have stayed with my rucksack. 

&gt;**Your progression to professional footballer was also a little curious. While other players developed in the youth teams of major clubs, you were playing small-time clubs from the villages.**                                                                 
                                                                                                      
&gt;You could say that. I played once at a pitch that was almost like a skateboard     half-pipe. The middle of the pitch was a few metres lower than the two penalty boxes.    Another time we played in the countryside and on the halfway line there was a telephone pole.               

&gt;**What happened if the ball bounced off it?**

&gt;Tough luck. You know, the people never complained about it. You just played and       didn't moan. Sometimes the soil would be the purest sludge, but when you're playing   out in the sticks you don't expect a Wembley lawn. I remember also a game in an open  field, the wind was blowing so strong that I had to catch my own clearances.                          

&gt;**Did you believe at this time that you'd make it as a professional?**

&gt;No, but I never really did anything other than play. I played for my team and     then again on Sundays with the old men in a pub team. There were all stocky guys                      and then I was stood in goal like a toddler. At age 15 I only went to school to                       play football. I only took part in the PE classes. Nobody really paid attention,                      
I finished school anyway. 

&gt;**What did you do afterwards?**
                                                                                                      
&gt;Oh, all kinds of jobs. I worked as a waiter in a restaurant where the waste on the           floor went right back into the fryer.. When I'd had enough of that I worked as a                      buider. A thankless job, especially when I'd broken a rib playing football.

&gt;**You kept working?**

&gt;Of course. I had no cash and was young and naive. I thought it'd just heal itself    somehow. What I learnt from that, it's not good for the recovery of a broken rib if                   you spend the whole day lugging buckets of rubble around. 

&gt;**In England some fans stil jokingly call you ""the binman"".**

&gt;Yeah, that's another job I did, though only for a month. Many take it for a        disreputable job, they've got no respect for this work. But everyone's got rubbish,           it's a part of life. And to them I'd say one thing: in the most fashionable houses                    in the richest parts of town I've seen the shabbiest conditions. Gardens allowed todeteriorate so much that I wouldn't let my dog in there.
                                                                                                                                                                                
I'll try to take a look at parts 2 &amp; 3 tomorrow, but I don't know if I'll have the time.

null,null,dystopian_now,,Corbyns under beds,null,"&gt; Sorry I thought your implication that Blair is directly responsible for killing Iraqis, and not ISIS and Saddam Hussein, meant that. Only with the left can killing people you didn't kill be attributed to you because mental gymnastics.
&gt; 

Those who start aggressive wars are usually considered to be responsible for what happens as a result of that war. According to the Nuremberg principles, upon which much of international law is based, those who start aggressive wars are responsible for the subsequent crimes that result. That isn't 'mental gymnastics', that's just a basic fact of international law.

&gt; The US gave weapons to Saddam Hussein almost 20 years before the events we were discussing, whom at the time the US could not have possibly foreseen doing what he did later, nor could've removed because the conditions for a regime change did not exist in the slightest. It made sense to back Saddam against Soviet-favoured Iran. I find this a relatively ironic argument considering its regularity, the US should've gone against Saddam then, but later when we had the ability to remove him and did, it was imperialism? Make up your mind, should we oppose these dictatorships or shouldnt we?
&gt; 

It's almost like there might be some middle ground between giving chemical weapons to a murderous regime and launching an imperialist war.

&gt; Also that link you cited from The Guardian does not say what you say it says, we made the decision to leave Iraq, not the Iraqi government. Although at the time the Iraqi government believed it was secure enough to maintain itself, our own military high command and a variety of politicians were warning otherwise, and whadya know, what they were saying would happen, happened. Now we have ISIS. Great job pacifists.
&gt; 

The US wanted to maintain bases, the Iraqi government did not allow them to, that is not in dispute. You are very confused about what the word pacifist means here, it does not mean 'someone who does not want to continue the Iraq War indefinitely'.

&gt; Oh, and yes, anti-war protests and response to voters does in fact exercise large amounts of influence on the actions of governments. The same happened in Vietnam and Cambodia back in the day, that led to Pol Pot which im sure you also think was good for stability or something.
&gt; 

More strawman nonsense, makes already weak arguments look even worse.

&gt; Jeremy Corbyn works directly with Hamas and Hezbollah

Citation needed. This is like saying that Blair and Major worked directly with the IRA.

&gt; Everyone saying ""oh dont intervene, dont do anything, we shouldnt've touched Libya, Syria, Iraq, etc"". Not doing anything when something can be done is the direct acknowledgement that these governments are apparently the best option to remain in power. Im sorry but this is how it works. Im sure once again though, mass-repression and genocidal tendencies is okay for stability or something.
&gt; 

Ok. I suppose that it's time to start launching missiles and carpet bombing every single country which has a less than democratic government, if you don't advocate immediately invading all countries with which we have a cordial relationship (despite their repressive policies) like China, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain ad infinitum then you think that 'mass-repression and genocidal tendencies is okay for stability or something'. 

Oh wait, I suppose that would also apply to your family members and your Anthony.

I actually went to university and sought to become a teacher, doing a degree in primary teaching.

I failed the placement and, when given the choice, I decided to drop the QTS side of the degree and just earn my degree, meaning I still graduated in 2014.

It meant I'm not a qualified teacher, but by then my mind was made up: I didn't want to teach anymore.

Since then, I've heard a *lot* about people from my course who've either not gone into teaching yet at all, but had QTS (Just ""putting it off until they're ready to teach"") or like my friend, who started teaching last September but then by the Easter Holidays she had handed her notice in and instead became a nursery nurse.

I know that only more from my course are going to leave over the next few years. And honestly I do not blame them at all. I truly have a great amount of respect for *anybody* who is a teacher, because fuck me, it really broke me in the end.

I find it particularly bad when she says that any legitimate Burlesque that meets her standards is like the lockness monster. It's the tiniest token that someone somewhere might not be applicable to her criticism but that arguments based on their existence are abstract and unimportant. 

I imagine it's quite likely that a majority of things called burlesque is stripping by another name but I'm also positive that there are many performers who go out to offer something different and do something they believe is more than stripping even if it involves it. If the problem is the lack of artistic merit why encourage people to squash it by calling *all* burlesque stripping and not leave any wiggle room? 

It's not that there isn't legitimate criticisms to be made and actually there is probably a good read about the difference between the promise and reality of Edinburgh fridge burlesque. That maybe more effort could be made to find performances that offer more that a strip and nipple tassels. 

But then again so what if it is stripping by another name with a bit of reassurances everyone's having a good empowering old time?

null,null,lossaysswag,lfc12,,null,"If league position can be damning evidence after four games, it certainly can be positive evidence.

""We could've"" but we aren't.

We could've won the league.  But we didn't.  We could've seen out the game taking away points without Lovren and Skrtel's errors as well as Coutinho's red card, but we didn't.

""Rodgers needs to go.  He's a fraud.  Anyone who believes he can lead this team is a moron."" - That's not criticism.  Especially when we didn't get undone by the tactics of a lesser side.  We got undone by the mistakes of a defense that seemed to be pretty solid.  A week ago Arsenal supporters were praising Skrtel for playing out of his skin.  Two weeks ago Liverpool fans were praising Lovren for seemingly turning his form around and actually looking like a proper leader.  Now they're both responsible for our undoing at home to West Ham.  Every judgment, good and bad, is being made in the present.  But when it's bad less perspective and consideration is given and people immediately jump to the worst of the worst conclusions.

So no, I'm not fooling myself into comfort.  I'm not saying ""nothing needs to change because we have 7 points out of 12.""  However, given all the concerns from last season and the uncertainty surrounding how we'd play there are plenty of positives to build on including taking 7 points, with a point coming away to Arsenal where we looked our best.  ""What if's"" don't work the way you think they do.  Yeah, we could have not benefited from offside and foul calls.  But if we hadn't, who is to say *everything* following those calls would have played out exactly the same?  You can't just change one detail and suspect that would be the only difference between your hypothetical scenario and reality.

Furthermore, Tomkins made that statement AND THEN PROCEEDED TO PROPERLY CRITICIZE THE TEAM.

However, a slightly nicer public facing role could be something along the lines of working in a library or even a bookshop. People tend to be quiet in there, they generally know what they're looking for and I've never heard of massive scenes being caused in the local Waterstones.

It will still help you work on dealing with people in a face to face role but would possibly be less taxing for you.

I work retail. I hate people but I can turn on the old ""OMG, I haven't seen you for ages. How's the kids?"" etc and I can feign interest up to a point. My daughter, however, is definitely not going to be suited to retail due to her Asperger's.

It's no good trying to force yourself to do a job that makes you really miserable and tense all day. You'll just end up making yourself ill.

null,null,ChronaMewX,mcgann,McGann,null,"&gt; We've gone from ""just this once, everybody lives"" and ""this planet is protected!"" to a Doctor who is pretty nonchalant about people dying.

I don't think this is a fair thing to say - he's not so much nonchalant about it as he is focused on the bigger picture - he acknowledges that some people will die and there's nothing he can do about it, so instead of mourning he's focused on saving everyone else. He never poked fun at anyone's death, he just didn't waste time he didn't have on mourning. Into The Dalek is a perfect example - he knew that the guy was about to get killed, so he fed him a tracking thing - if he instead started crying and saying it's not fair, what good would that have accomplished? His endgame is saving everyone he can save.

Time Heist is an excellent example of it too - you could see the pain in his eyes when Psi and Saibra ""died"", but he knew that time was a factor so he pressed on. He wasn't glad they died and wished they hadn't (and luckily he was right in the end), it's just that he was still in the middle of a mission and had to finish it.

&gt; I feel like in previous seasons, I could get attached to characters who were only in one episode (and more importantly, so did the Doctor!). I felt sadder when I thought Ida Scott had died than when we found out Danny had died. Doctor Who used to have so much heart--it's what set it apart from similar shows, but that all feels different now.

I'm not sure how that's changed though. Season 8 gave a lot of one off characters that people loved. Psi and Saibra as I mentioned earlier, Shona from Last Christmas, Rigsy from Flatline, Perkins from Mummy, etc. It's just Danny that most people disliked, but seeing as his purpose in the story was to try to ground Clara and oppose the Doctor, that makes him a very easy to dislike character. It's the same reason tons of people hate Skyler in Breaking Bad - they want to see more ~~adventures in time and space~~ meth cooking but here comes ~~Danny~~ Skyler to give the very real but very boring perspective that ~~Clara~~ Walt was doing something that was extremely dangerous and putting himself and his family at risk. In universe they couldn't be more correct, but as viewers that's not exactly the perspective we want to hear and thus most fans dislike them.

Funnily enough, the opinions of Clara are split - a lot of people hated her in 7 because she had no plot to her besides being a mystery, then liked her more when she was given a more personal plot. While you're on the other side of the picture. Personally I'm really excited for Clara next season because she's got no ties left to earth - Danny is dead, she'll become a full time companion that lives on the TARDIS. It'll be an interesting change :)",null,0,null,1440958796,null,null,false,0,cukysaw,null,t3_3iyza6,null,null,null,t3_3iyza6,null,null,null,1441589051,null,46,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,46,null

null,null,irt92,null,null,null,"I agree with the Malm√∂ game it's nothing to do with money! Some of the teams we have beaten over the years have had frightening wage and transfer budgets.  Think it just comes down to poor performances and playing a team that is about half way through their season with some form. 

I think with the money however isn't that we don't spend like some people claim, I think we have just bought poorly. I think with spending ¬£2 million each on the likes of Scepovic, Balde, Pukki, Armstrong, and roughly ¬£1-¬£1.5 million on Efe, Boerrigter, Boyata, Cifti. Not to mention the players we spent money on that have come really good for us it's roughly around the ¬£8million mark. 

Right there that's roughly ¬£21 million reinvested. We can't afford to reinvest everything not in the current state of Scottish football! 

So for me it's not about the fact that ""the board are lining their own pockets"" as some have stated., It's about the fact that we went from being the obvious stand out team in Scotland head and shoulders above anyone else, to signing the entire Dundee United strike force?
 
The loans I am unsure about. When we have an option to buy its a good idea I feel, but without that option it really is just improving someone else's player. Also gives us an unrealistic representation of how good our team is when some of the best players from the season before are sent back to their teams the next season.

I'm a Rangers fan, so I'll use them as an example. Rick Nash was one of the hardest working players last year, especially considering he didn't score most of his goals on the Power Play. He scored from good areas and bad ones. Meanwhile, Carl Hagelin had so many blown opportunities. He couldn't finish at all. He probably had the same number of opportunities as Nash at even strength, and yet he scored significantly less.

So why are you saying you do?

&gt;a spy agency that was completely secret until it was leaked by Snowden.

Except that arms of the UK's intelligence service have had departments like this since their inception. Snowden has leaked nothing but the name. And this unit only has a name for the simple reason that new technology and new issues tend to require the need of new approaches.

Or TLDR: If you think it is news that the UK intelligence services has explored a variety of secret agent techniques over the years, you might be more vegetable than man. If you think that the intelligence services deciding not to go around publicly trumpeting ""Oh hey guys, we just made a new department to explore psychological and internet operations since we have the internet now!"" means that it was TOP SECRET... you might be more vegetable than man.

&gt;However we do have the following as a result of the leaks, showing these techniques are in fact in operation.

How is helping the police shut down a website identifying confidential informants and people in witsec ""actively shap[ing] online opinions to change public perception of people and events""?

Whilst we definitely need a defensive minded player in the middle (to start ahead of Mason/maybe push Mason on to play better), I can't help but feel to get in the top four, we'd need a player who can cover the back four, whilst also providing something going forward.

Pato hasn't been good in Europe for a long while and has been plagued with injuries. For the price, he would be a  great gamble, but hardly a top four signing. Especially as much smaller clubs have managed to get players like Rondon, Shaqiri etc.

The ""Brendan's a genius"" crowd will shift the blame elsewhere (players, fans, refs) when things go wrong, and bleat incessantly when things go well. This is the internet, where the loudest voices are inevitably the most passionate.

The truth is that Brendan is a manager with some very obvious flaws but is capable of doing very good things. It will not always be perfect, it will not always be awful.

When Rodgers came in he spoke about playing with 11 outfielders. But signed Mignolet. Whether it was due to financial constraints or something else, we wont know. Then he signed Lovren who from the looks of it needs cover to perform his role. Rodgers likes his fullbacks to move up the pitch but with Lovren he has been compromised to have a very traditional back 4 with two fullbacks tucking in. So if you look at it he has compromised on his philosophy. Playing out from the back was a part of his thinking but largely with problems of his own making we have abandoned it.  The other compromise is buying Benteke when we did so well with fluid strikers. We tried to get in Sanchez last season but completely tore up that blueprint for god knows what reasons. Now we are in the middle of nowhere. I wonder how many questions Rodgers is asking himself everyday and maybe that translates to our on field performances. Whenever we go down a goal we look full of doubt. Rodgers has had a huge learning curve here.

On the huffpo link in the other article, 4000 people found fit for work died over a two year period, so 2000 people in a year. The number of people found fit for work in that year was 133,333 (from the 400K over 3 years number you gave). That would mean a death rate of 2000/133333 or 1500/100,000.

The death rate for those on incapacity benefit is 1032 per 100,000, so it's not 4 times higher, it's 50% higher.

Is there something I'm missing?

Still, given the fact that this is comparing two different data sets with two different time periods adds some uncertainty. The paper that gave the ""random death rate"" said that it had been decreasing and the numbers are from a more recent and shorter time period so it would mean that the 1032/100000 rate is likely an underestimate.

Also of the 4000 that were found fit for work it was only stated that 1360 were actually made to go to work. The rest have pending appeals and the info on the appeals success rate is not provided. If only a fraction of those people had their appeals upheld then the difference between ""random death rates"" and death rates following being made to go back to work disappears.

These and a few other factors can could quite dramatically change your conclusion. So as far as I can tell, I think the conclusion from the source you used is probably correct:

---
&gt;
&gt;Gwyneth's parents died of influenza when she was twelve and she was brought up by Mr Sneed. She went to school only once a week and gained ¬£8 a year. She fancied the butcher's boy.
&gt;When Gwyneth gave the Ninth Doctor a cup of tea, she said, ""Two sugars, sir. Just as you like it"", although she had never met him before. These psychic powers enabled her to be contacted by the gaseous Gelth who had arrived in the city via a space-time rift located there.
&gt;Gwyneth and the Doctor agreed to the Gelth's pleas to let them come through to Earth and possess dead bodies in order to survive. The Gelth lied to them about the extent of their numbers and their hostile intentions. When she stood underneath an archway in order to contact the Gelth, they passed through, and trapped the Doctor and Rose. Learning the Gelth's true intentions, Gwyneth was able to hold them inside the house, though not to send them back. To destroy them, she struck a match once the Doctor and Rose had escaped, igniting the gas in the chamber and destroying herself in the process. The Doctor would have lit the match himself, but realised that Gwyneth had been dead since standing in the archway, despite remaining able to think and speak. (TV: *The Unquiet Dead*)

If you you're in an English school, you need at least two-three A levels to get in anywhere for most courses. Need to pass IELTS (english test) with a level 6 or above for UK visa and to meet university English requirements. SATS are not required and TOEFL is mainly for US/Australian universities. 

I'd recommend you to start looking at different courses and see what suits you and you might be interested in.

If he wants to only play 18yr olds all the time, he can go coach the academy (because he has a bloody good eye for young talent) but if we want to challenge for top 4, get someone else in. 

All we want to see is progress and if you're brutally honest, in our first 3 matches we were lucky to get the results and yesterday when he tried anything, got his ass handed to him.

Rodgers picked up Liverpool during one of our worst periods in PL history. He was chosen by FSG mainly to consistently improve the team. Under him we have made poor signings, partially because we can't attract the top talent we would like to and partially because of transfer strategies that brought us less proven player but every Raheem and Suarez had a Borini and Coates.

Did Suarez help the team break top 4? Yes he was key. 

Were Rodgers' attacking tactics key to us breaking top 4 and utilising Suarez best? Yes, Suarez himself agreed to that

Last season was underachieving. We are the 5th best team but we don't aim to finish 5th, that is unambitious so we aim for 4th or better but finishing 5th or 6th as we did is not a disaster, just underachieving.

Do I believe in Rodgers taking us forward? Yes, I do have faith. He has shown he has the ability to go on strong runs of form even when the squad is in a poor season with no striker. 

We are at 7/12 and if we repeat this form we end at 67 points which is 4th or just outside top 4 and that is after player Arsenal and Stoke away.

null,null,Halizu,null,null,null,"Just my opinion:

When he's playing well, Fabregas' defensive contribution is pretty good. Works harder than you think, makes clutch interceptions etc.

Of course, when he isn't playing well, his defensive contribution is practically non-existent.

Regarding the potential tactical changes:

If you think about it, the system we play is actually pretty damn rare.

Most teams use their full-backs offensively. The average FB is virtually an auxiliary winger, even in the more defensive sides like Sevilla and Atletico. Whilst Ivanovic may fancy himself going forward, he certainly doesn't possess the requisite attacking prowess.

The main job of our full-backs has been to 'sit'. Hence why a natural CB is played at RB, and a natural RB at LB. It worked brilliantly well for large parts of last season, having an extra aerial threat made for so many more goals. Cahill/Terry/Ivanovic scored what? 15 goals?

I've always thought that because of this somewhat reserved tactic, a player who is naturally a 10 is required to play a position that would usually be occupied by 'Jack of all trades' type box-to-box player.

I think the reason we always seemed to play terribly when Cesc was in the 10 last season, despite it being his supposed best position, is that in this system, a player with his vision/passing range from deep is an absolute necessity, at least if you want to have any chance of breaking down the opposition.

I believe that if Dave and Baba were played, then Ramires/RLC in the pivot would work, but with the 'sitting defense', a genuine B2B player doesn't fit the system, unless of course, we are parking the bus. 

The role of offensive full-backs is absolutely huge in freeing up space in the middle. Think Alba/Alves, Coke/Tremoulinas etc.

Moving Dave to the right does however mean that JT would no longer have the protection he needs, so a Cahill-Zouma partnership is likely. This would bring about the potentiality of high line though, as they're both quick. With more offensive-minded full-backs, a high line allows them to contribute more to the attack.

TL;DR In my opinion, playing a completely different player to Cesc has implications that aren't immediately thought of.

Exactly what have I mistaken here? Most likely he was talking about YPJ/YPG and the Christian factions, which calling them terrorists is about as dumb as thinking Assad is the good guy in all of this.

You really don't know what you're talking about if you think this conflict is as simple as labelling one side as terrorists and then claiming because they ""murdered hundreds of people"". The Turks were murdering Kurds before PKK was even an idea, so honestly get off that frame of mind that you think that Kurds had much choice other than to arm themselves and fight back. This isn't a black and white argument, you really don't seem to know what you're talking about. The Turks were indiscriminately bombing entire villages, before there was PKK even existed (look at the Dersim massacres), but I guess that's not murder to you, right. Before you talk about murder and use that as justification or an argument for, actually look at the actions of the other side.

The reason why they are labelled terrorists is because to keep NATO Turkey member happy as they are the whole reason why they were labelled terrorists. That's all it is. What they did in their past is what happens when you have a conflict that lasts for 50 years, they get desperate and fall into the trap of doing things you would regret, but the reality is different now, before the peace process broke down, the PKK constantly wanted a third party mediator like the US or EU to be inolved to ensure the peace process is successful as the Kurds actually want peace, but the Turks very strongly objected this.. This should be enough signs on who is actually prolonging this war.

The PKK is fighting along side the Peshmerga and has been since ISIS practically u-turned and started attacking Kurdish areas. If the PKK was not there, it would have been far worse than what happened to Sinjar. And if it wasn't for the PKK's help, hundreds of people would have died on the Sinjar mountains when ISIS was pushing pasted with heavy weapons and armour and only the PKK was able to know how to fight them.

Due to the reason of the PKK being on the list, the US military on the ground there are unable to work with them and that's what has also annoyed them, and the reality is not once have any nation from the west conflicted with the PKK.

The reason that's a danger is you effectively outlaw a company investing in itself.  

Director No. 1 - ""Well, we're now the number one seller of Boondoggle Widgets in Southern England; the plan for next year is to build a larger factory and become the number one seller in the whole UK.""  

Director No. 2 - ""I dunno, HMRC has warned us they're going to examining all our accounts if we don't put in a year with a 25% profit margin.""

Director No. 1 - ""Well, in that case we can stay the same size as we are, fire half the staff we currently have and clock a nice 30% profit.""

Director No. 2 - ""Done and done.""

When push comes to shove, a company paying 0% tax is not a problem at all.  But only if it's outgoings are actually outgoings, of course.  If there is any evidence that expenses are being inflated as a way of extracting money from a business then we're talking criminal tax evasion.  But if the expenses are legitimate, that money is still active in the economy, and probably either being paid as salary (which has a higher effective tax rate than corporation tax anyway), or paid to a separate profitable company and taxed as part of their profits.

What subjects or subject areas interest you? Sciences? Medicine? Languages? Art? UK university courses involve specialisation from the start, so it's not too early to be thinking about this. British 16-year-olds are already being encouraged to figure out what they want to do!

Qualifications, money, and visa are the three big things you'll need to be able to sort out. Don't be afraid to ask universities directly about how qualifications from overseas correspond to their normal entry requirements, they're familiar with such matters and it won't prejudice your application.

Given the current situation in Syria, visas might be the most problematic issue, unfortunately. No matter how honest your intentions and how far removed you are from Syria's problems, some bureaucrat at an embassy could decide to fill their quota of refusals by suggesting that you're not a 'real' student. So, do your research on this topic very thoroughly. This subreddit isn't likely to be much help, though, as most of us don't have to deal with visas for the UK!

A particular source of useful information, once you start to get an idea of what and where you might want to study, is the student-run international societies which exist at just about every individual university. They'll have a lot of advice which British residents might not be able to provide, or might not think of providing.",null,0,null,1440966274,null,null,false,0,cul2wgn,null,t3_3iz10h,null,null,null,t1_cukyc57,null,null,null,1441592938,null,-1,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,-1,null

You've got the wrong end of the stick here, I'm not using this 4,000 figure.

The uncertainty in the calculation was with the total number of ""fit to work"" decisions. I was in correspondence with a doctor recently who arrived independently at approximately the same figures though with more accurate data. I overestimated the duration (2.17 years rather than 3 years), underestimated the total number of ""fit to work"" outcomes (574,000 rather than 400,000), and the end result is approximately the same.

Also, and on a note which is separate from the details of the calculation (which you haven't given me any reason to doubt), it seems pretty astounding to me that you view this as akin to the case of a prosecution lawyer in a court of law. Surely *any* excess mortality (let alone the vast excess mortality we're finding here) should be grounds for an urgent inquiry.

Would I prefer the perfect striker, of course, but a the need for stop gap now isn't just short term thinking. Maybe Clint can be the number 2, but we were told he works better as a second striker. Maybe Son can lead the line, but from what I've read he's a winger. As for Chadli, I thought he could do it but when we tried it against Stoke he utterly failed to lead the line. My main concern isn't the actual fee to be honest, its wages. If we get a stop gap on reasonable wages we can sell them on in a year or two and knowing Levy we won't lose much, hell he might even make a profit.

Don't get me wrong if we don't get something done I'm not going to throw a fit, but I think we need someone there. Personally I'm more concerned about a CDM. Poch is clearly interested in playing that way this year and as it stands all we have for it is an out of position CB.

I agree that the Doctor is more pragmatic: nothing to be gained from mourning so just keep moving, esp when time is tight.

null,null,hu6Bi5To,null,null,null,"&gt; Cracking down on tax avoidance schemes would be the other approach then.

That's much easier said than done.

If anything (warning: unpopular opinion ahead), there's been too much of a crackdown on tax avoidance already.  There's not much sympathy for this opinion as it is usually very wealthy people being pursued.  I'm thinking of things like recent cases of people abusing tax breaks in the film industry - HMRC reclaimed money from tax years over twelve years ago: (example: http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/05/england-ashes-tax-bills).

Why's this a bad thing?  The whole scheme was only possible because of a previous government incentive to flood the British film industry with money.  This was exactly the sort of thing the government and HMRC intended to happen.  But once they realised the flaws - shedloads of money going in to crap projects that were never intended to be viable films - the whole back-tracking started using the powers they have under ""aggressive tax avoidance"".

Essentially it's all HMRC's fault that most of these things happen.  They would be better off tinkering with the system less, not more.

Whenever there is a difference in rates of tax under different circumstances, there will be an incentive to rearrange your affairs to take advantage of that difference.  And there always be differences.  It's impossible to make it illegal to take advantage of it - how would you ever know?  If you made it illegal for Starbucks USA to charge Starbucks UK with an administration fee, and they decided to change to a McDonald's style franchise model instead, still extracting most cash to the USA, would that be illegal?  Would that make McDonald's illegal too, even though it always operated that way?

The real cost of this obsession with tax avoidance is felt greatest by small businesses.  Look at the whole IR35 fiasco for an example, it's a rule that can be avoided with a bit of creativity, but by being ""honest"" you put yourself in a situation where it's illegal to have company expenses exceed 5% of turnover (with a massive 50-page manual detailing the exceptions).  Originally this was done to shut-down tax avoidance - self incorporated individuals avoiding income tax - but that incentive will be removed soon due to other anti tax-avoidance measures (the change in dividend taxes).  Yet IR35 will persist, because, well no-one knows, but we can't have a small IT consultancy train new members of staff without paying tax on the money first could we?  Perish the thought!

The problem is: there are a lot of very well connected, very wealthy people, making a lot of money and not paying enough tax.  All the proposed solutions however, merely add more red-tape onto those already paying a lot of tax; the wealthy just move on.

The solution isn't to play whack-a-mole with tax loopholes, but to go back to the drawing board and figure out a better way of raising money entirely.

But she's completely aware of her irrationality, how logic is failing her to the utmost, but she can't get around her emotional loss of this... and that's what she's exploring. She even admits to being a dinosaur. In the end she ties it up nicely... her loss is less to do with him specifically, it's her discovery of her own redundancy that upsets her. It's a timeless tale that happens in most mother-son dynamics at some point.

As an aside... I'm a hopelessly middleclass tattooless man (not for me but nothing against them) when I have kids (I'm in my early 30's now), I'll have this convo with them when they're in their early teens, and essentially tell them it's their body and their decision... but still offer advice. i.e. it's better to wait until you're 21 (you're much more like 30 at 21 than you are at 18)... sleep on it for at least a week before you get it, and when you get the stencil, if it doesn't feel 100% right, stop and rework it, or go to another artist. Do it for yourself, never on someone else's suggestion (unless they're a muse for you and you've already decided you want one)... and if you most get one above the collarbone, below the ankle or beyond your wrist, wait until you're at least 25 and you have a strong idea of the direction your career is going to take, the last thing you want to do is limit your options...

Also duh... never get something representing a love interest in your life. That's just smothered in jinx and regret.

As a former amateur player myself I can relate with form issues.  The team will return to its winning form at some point.  They have far too many resources at their disposal to assist them in returning to form; from physiotherapists to doctors to equipment managers to sports psychologist to specialist coaches--the support system is that massive and that talented.  We are not privy to the day-to-day operations of this club but this is just a glance at how elaborate the support system is for each of these players.  They will succeed again.  In the meantime, let's revel in the youth movement and encourage our team back to form as supporters.  I'm tired of negativity.  I'm frankly tired of us trashing Ivanovic.  If he *hypothetically* gets transferred in January say to oh...Bayern Munich, and he comes back to knock out Chelsea with the aggregate winning goal, a lot of people will start to bemoan his loss.  Listen.  The guy is a warrior.  Like Terry, his best days are likely behind him.  But really, what we need to do is trust Jose Mourinho to do the right thing and also expect that the same support team will live up to their end of the bargain and ensure that the players are given the best chance to be match fit.

He¬¥s always been kinda sluggish in defense. He was never pacey or good technical with his feet and passes in offense either. But he always scored when we needed to so it seems. City away, europa league final, Napoli the list goes on. I¬¥m very thankful and he have my respect for that but it¬¥s not what I¬¥m looking at at a right back more so a striker. He stole the show and became unbenchable for perhaps valid reasons. 

He¬¥s never been my ideal RB. Lahm said in an interview on how to be a good fullback is first to always think on defending. The first priority. My ideal full back or in this case RB is the following. Must be stellar in defense(tackles positioning), have to run as fast as pacey wingers who has the ball, Good in offense, tireless(can play 90minutes), right footed(or twofooted), technical good enough to exchange passes and overlap with midfielders. Azpilicueta fulfills these criterias and has just recently starting to become very good in offense compared to before. He¬¥s got 1 goal and 1 assist already. Ivanovic is just not comparable to Azpi even though he can score important goals. But you don't have a RB to score important goals. You have a striker/forward for that.

The question is if Baba can replace Azpi at LB and let Azpi takeover his natural RB position. The latter I¬¥m confident with as we know that¬¥s his natural position and he has played great there before. Azpi sent Ashley Cole to the bech ffs. He¬¥s incredible.

To me that's about as serious a breach of the rule of law as a Home Secretary can manage.

The only other time something like this has happened (recently) was in the 90s, when a Home Secretary ignored a court order not to deport someone (the court wanted the deportation delayed until it could hear the case). But he was out of office by the time the contempt order was finalised - and even then there was a mini constitutional crisis over whether it was even possible for a court to find a minister in contempt in this way.

Theresa May didn't face any punishment (imprisonment or a fine) because she eventually did release the guy in question.

Everyone wants to write 12 off as a grumpy old man, but that's a terrible way to look at the character. To understand 12, you have to look at 11. 11 was a warrior. People forget that. They remember all his funny eccentricities, but the fact is that right from the beginning he had a cold rage burning inside him. He also spent hundreds of years locked in perpetual battle (as much as I disliked ""Time of the Doctor"", I liked that he got thrust back into a war so quickly after meeting the War Doctor).

12's regeneration was a catharsis. He let go of the emotions he's been keeping bottled up. So outwardly he seems a lot more severe than he was before. But really he just took down the fa√ßade. He's not using quirky weirdness to balance out his darker nature. He's upfront about himself. This also feeds into his hatred of soldiers. 10 and 11 were soldiers who were desperately trying to convince both themselves and everyone else that they weren't soldiers. But 12 is the veteran.

In terms of next steps, your engagement letter (or a leaflet which accompanied it) will have referred to their complaints procedure, and mentioned who you can contact if you have a complaint. Write to that person. If you've lost those documents, ask for another copy.

&gt;I haven't yet encountered a moral argument, despite my repeated posing of the question, as to why Tories are any morally higher or less deserving of censure than far-right groups such as the BNP, the KKK, and neo-Nazis. On one hand we see the deepest racial prejudice. On the other hand we see the deepest class prejudice. The Tories have literally claimed that poverty is self-inflicted and accused the poor of being criminals, drug-addicts and welfare scammers. Popularity isn't an excuse, any more than it was an excuse in Germany in the 1930s; any more than it was an excuse in this country when the Popish Plot drove the nation into raving hysteria. Madness of the crowds is a very real phenomenon. People are also extremely capable of developing a moral blindspot towards a designated out-group ... especially when they are egged on by a media blitz which makes Fox News look tame.


The real reason the guy got hounded off r/ukpolitics is because of dumb comments like these and personally attacking people with an air of superiority. 
Now he is aware his views are not capable of co existing with r/ukpolitics, which is still left compared to the UK population, he runs here instead.

Sensible debate? The guy was a total buffoon who thinks he is a genius.
Like how he had to run to an echo chamber, admitting that in reality his views are extreme.

My longest ride was 130 miles and it was knackering (though mostly because it was done through the night as a charity ride), we had one person turn up on a hybrid who hadn't done anything more than cycle a few miles to work everyday as training which slowed us down but damn if he didn't finish! but I regularly did 80 plus rides and was fine the next day and I was no kind of athlete.

One of the guys in my cycling club is a 55year old ex-alcoholic and he did the lands end/John o groats thing in 7 days 1 off the bike, biggest challenge would be been able to be comfortable on the seat for that long but modern seats, carbon frames and padded shorts are excellent and their is always cycling butter :)

null,null,PrinceUmbongo,null,null,null,"The three excuses you're talking about, Firstly, a large portion of this post is talking about the rebuilding phase thats happened since the squad he took over. It was an extremely poor one aside from a couple of players, nowhere near top quality. For the first time since BR came here we're not as fucked if a key player gets injured or goes off-form this season, there's quality in a lot of areas. If you think we have only taken one step forward I think that is bullshit. I think for a while we were relying on Gerrard to carry some mediocre players like adam, spearing, downing again and again. We've transitioned to an era without steven gerrard, at the same time the owners have sold Luis suarez for a cut price fucking fee to be fair, same with sterling, they could have put him on a new contract sooner, while basically never spending big unless we have players sold for big prices. I think people underestimate the job he has done in building the squad, I think you'll see that this season. Anytime we're shit it's rodgers fault but anytime we're good it's just down to the players eh? 
And did you watch the entirety of the games this season? Stoke game, they had zero chances. We basically had a point locked down, coutinho scores a fantastic winner. Is this ""Luck"" or does it have anything to do with rodgers putting coutinho through extra shooting practice and encouraging him to cut in and strike through it with his right foot? which he has done now multiple times? Bournemouth game. Lovren=fouled. Our goal was offside. Would the game have stayed 0-0 if we hadn't scored? It would have been a very different tactical game, we probably would have used ings. who the fuck knows. Another game where we were very defensively solid and bournemouth had posession but didn;t create a single clear cut chance. Arsenal, we weren't lucky, no fucking way. We by far had the better chances to win, arsenal had like one clear chance, giroud miss and close offside. We hit the woodwork twice and were denied by great petr cech performance. The great thing about that is that rodgers said exactly what he was going to do tactically, went there and did it, and you give him no credit!

The only game which hasn't worked so far, was west ham. I think you'll have noticed how few home wins there have been so far. Away sides are tending to play very defensively and spring on the counter at the moment. We were caught napping for first goal, that was just silly lapse in concentration at the start, put us on the back foot. We spent the first half probing, lovren literally gave away a goal. West ham did that to bournemouth last week, it's a silly individual error. And then we were chasing the game against the already parked bus. Arsenal couldn;t take it down at the emirates in a very similar game with ozil and sanchez. What would you have done differently? You don't want to take players out of team that did so well against arsenal, creating lots of chances? You giive it a chance. Half time, big change to go 3-4-3 to try and get wingbacks crossing it in. Wasn't good enough service. If you get hit on the counter which was that big defensive lapse it is very difficult to break it down. Compare us to our rivals, we've not had the worst start to the season.

Edit: Also to /u/Kryogenetics, stop commenting that that ""my opinion seems to be unpopular with the armchair supporters with this subreddit"". Shut the fuck up. I was surrounded by supporters on saturday at the game who have had their season tickets for years, they were pissed off when the game finished, they could all see Iva was getting done and was out of position and they didn't say nothing about because 'we have to blindly support our team and each player through everything', they all let their feelings known that Iva has to be benched. Yet they are supporting our team week in week out a hell of a lot more than you are sitting at your computer telling everyone that we should never criticise anyone ever and never say anything bad about players. Get off your high fucking smug horse, this is what fans do.

The European Commission said there were about 600,000 asylum applications in 2014, many coming from areas of conflict like Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Nigeria, Somalia and Ukraine, making them likely refugees. Of the around 130,000 processed, about 10% were declared refugees. You may or may not consider that a fair approximation of the actual number depending on how much you trust the countries involved. Stats from here: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Asylum_statistics

I will point out that the oft-touted distinction between ""refugees"" and ""economic migrants"" is pretty blurry. What do you say about people whose economic deprivation has been caused by warfare or human rights abuses, for example?

The most dangerous route is across the Mediterranean (and thus the route most badly hit by the UK's refusal to fund search-and-rescue) from Libya to Italy.

Of course there has to be context to estimate what counts as bad enough results, and i think OOP has provided enough context for me to just throw out some numbers here.

4 matches in; no way!

1/4 matches in; depends on how bad, and how we have been playing, but still to soon imo.

Around christmas; this is the point where the owners have to take a choice, namely, do we sack, do we probe for others or do we commit to BR for the remaining season.

3/4-4/4 matches in; choice is made to keep or sack based on how the team has performed.


For me there should be 3 outcomes.

1. We perform awful until christmas, and BR is sacked.

2. We do ok until christmas, but not good enough season-wise, so BR is sacked.

3. We get top 4 or better, and BR stays for atleast one more season.

Nb: Of course there are different contextual variations of how the future will pan out, but i nthink this will be the general gist of it.

There will likely *always* be appalling individual cases. To have a system which never makes a mistake would be phenomenally expensive. Would you be happy paying 10% more tax if it meant 1000 fewer individual horror stories? How about 10 fewer? How about 1?

I don't know how many people the individual stories represent. But I don't think running a welfare system is easy or simple. And I think that in reality there will likely always be people it lets down, though we should always try to improve on that.

This season has been painful, I agree. However, there was no way of keeping Sneiderlin. In fairness, this happened to United and Ronaldo- they got one more season out of him and then he moved so, as painful as it is, if it can happen to United, we can't be surprised when it happens to a club as small as Southampton. As for Clyne, if he wasn't going to sign then we'd lose him for nothing next season. How's that working out for De Gea and United...? 

Still, I'm not so sure about the replacements this year. Losing Toby was huge. Still, it's early, I suppose. We'll see if we get that Celtic lad. Plus with Clasie and Bertrand back, it should be a lot better. Romeu seems to be doing well too.

&gt;What added powers would a fully nationalised railway enjoy which the nationalised railway does not already have by virtue of monopoly ownership of track and stations, and strong regulation of train services?

The power to operate train services in the public interest, rather than for private profit.

* Multiple operators would not have to compete for access to tracks, meaning timetables could be improved and trains could be re-routed onto other lines in the case of engineering works or incidents on the line
* Simpler tickets with more flexible routes. The current system is ridiculously complicated because it has to account for all the different train operators and their individual ticket offers and so on.
* Giving local and regional government more control over transport policies in their area, and being able to harmonise timetables, tickets etc. with buses and trams
* It would be possible to plan infrastructure and rolling stock upgrades beyond the life of a franchise. Investment can be directed where and when it is needed, rather than being tied to private companies' need to turn a profit.

&gt; How would you use additional powers over train management to improve things,

See above

&gt;and why couldn‚Äôt this be done under existing regulatory powers?

Because the existing regulatory framework is absurd, unfit for purpose, and always has been. In 20+ years of privatised railways no government has managed to regulate it properly.

&gt;Why is the performance of the completely nationalised Network Rail so poor? Why is it 25% less efficient than continental railways?

Setting aside the fact that Network Rail is publicly-owned because the private company that John Redwood's government set up (Railtrack) was a fucking disaster in every respect... probably because it has to work within this ridiculously fragmented, dysfunctional system, balancing multiple competing commercial interests against the interests of passengers and taxpayers.

&gt;Why does it often have to pay large performance penalties? Why does it need more subsidy when its valuable assets are on a balance sheet with so little net value?

Why *does* it have to pay large performance penalties? Who is it paying them to, and is it right that a publicly-owned organisation has to pay them at all?

&gt;Why was it unable to carry out a large agreed investment programme to expand and improve the track and signals in many parts of the country despite having access to large sums of taxpayer money?

See above

&gt;Would you want buy up all the engines and rolling stock, and if so how would you pay for that? What would be the benefits of owning rather than leasing?

Continue to lease existing rolling stock. There's no immediate need or practical benefit to re-purchasing old stock. The benefits of a nationalised railway would include a more coherent, integrated transport policy, meaning that procurement of new stock can be managed better. This may involve leasing or purchasing outright new stock.",null,0,null,1440974780,null,null,false,0,cul7l81,null,t3_3iy4jm,null,null,null,t3_3iy4jm,null,null,null,1441595212,null,3,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3,null

The only difference is Smalling/Blind looked more comfortable (maybe not the right word) than Lovren/Skrtel.  De Gea last year was worth a lot of points for them and was the reason they were not around 7th.  While they weren't in form they were drawing and we were loosing/drawing.

Chelsea are under-performing so far this season.  They have a core that has been around and performing for a few years.  Example Cahill, Terry, Azpi, Fabregas, Hazard anchor the team.  One of the best young GK in the world.

We have Coutinho, Henderson, Milner, Benteke.  Clyne is most likely gonna be our best and most consistent defender this year.  Skrtel can be good on his day, but more often than not he isn't a defender you see on a team sheet and go fuck.  He isn't a Hummels, Terry (past few years), Kompany, Bonucci, etc.  Very hard to buy that quality though.  Mignolet is a keeper you can win a title with, but he isn't in the conversation for top 10 world.  Most of the top 4 teams have a keeper in or very near that discussion.

For me the improvements to the team can be brought in before Tuesday.

LB - Gomez is not a LB, we all know that.  He is a cover and it works , but to be a consistently great team we need a player equal to or just a little under Clyne.  Moreno - Has moments going forward, but can be a liability defender.  Is that his age?  Should he be allowed to grow and get games and we put up with his lapses? Do we buy another big name?  If we buy another then I would say Willems (PSV), Souare (Crystal Palace has impressed me).  I would stick with Moreno though.

CBs - Keep Sakho, Buy Van Dijk (Celtic), Garay (Zenit), Veltman (Ajax), Dragovic (Dynamo Kyiv).  Go w/ Sakho/Skrtel and develop Van Dijk/Veltman/Dragovic or play a lineup of Sakho/1 of those 3.  Play Sakho/Garay if we buy him.  Play Lovren in league cups to keep is value and sell in December/Summer

* Cash and shareholders' funds are separate parts of a company's business. Shareholders' funds represent the net value of a company (effectively what you could sell it for). Cash held is just that. So the company holds ¬£5m cash and is worth ¬£400,000 on top of that. Putting them both in the same line suggests that they add to each other. In any event, any money that ends up there has already been taxed, so this is clearly just trying to muddy the situation. 

* The figures show a significant fall in revenue and profit, so it's a bit much to suggest it's ""another bumper year"".

* Writing off expenses isn't tax avoidance; it's fundamental to the concept of corporation tax that it's only paid on profits and those are obviously calculated after expenses. Every company does it (as do partnerships and sole practitioners).

* The article's point is basically that his business became less profitable and therefore paid less tax. Unless there's evidence that it wasn't actually less profitable (which would be evasion), then there's nothing wrong with that.

Kane doesn't quite look the same player who tore up the league last term yet, and Eriksen looks some way off his best and being able to reliably sink late winners.  To say that the goals will just come is naive I think... they may, but we also may have to face up to the facts that Eriksen got badly burnt out last season and had huge consistency problems, and Kane may also suffer a big sophomore slump and become another Andy Carroll, Francis Jeffers or David Bentley.  I'm sure hoping not, but stranger things have happened.

&gt; Its a completely different scenario though because those manifold problems in the tram have been rectified thus far. 

I would dispute that.  Chance creation stats notwithstanding (we've played three teams who finished in the bottom 11 of the league last season out of our four matches), our attack has still looked problematic on the pitch.  I don't think our attacking woes have been fully solved yet, and N'jie and Son are total unknown quantities when it comes to the EPL.

Plus, defensively we have stepped up a notch, but we still haven't come across a potent attacking team yet.  Man Utd have only one recognised striker and still haven't sorted their shit out or integrated their new boys yet, so I'd say only Leicester are a decent attacking side of the ones we've played.  I'd prefer to wait and see how the first 10 games play out before making claims about us sorting our defensive problems out.


&gt;They've been better than OK- weve been better team in all of our matches thus far this season.

We've been the better team for large patches of each match, but faltered badly at key times.  There's no point being better than Stoke for nearly the entire match if you switch off and concede twice in the dying minutes.  Doesn't mean we haven't played well at all, but self congratulating ourselves for some decent halves of football isn't productive I would argue.

null,null,nabeshiniii,null,null,null,"4,000 figure is a total number of deaths within several weeks of the assessment/claim. **This is not a death rate.** This is an absolute number of deaths where a death has occurred within six weeks. What you have worked out isn't the right number to compare to the 4,000 figure published. Let's explore how to use the death rate properly:

Since the 1,032 figure quoted was deaths per 100,000 people, you will need to adjust it for total number claimants at a specific period of time (not accounting for on-flow and off-flow for the benefit). This is a **very rough calculation** but as at May 2015,[ 2.27m people were on ESA.](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/433130/dwp-stats-summary-may-2015.pdf) We should expect that if 1,032 people out of every 100,000 claimant should be dead at the end of the period; then **23,400 out of 2,270,000 should be dead within the next period for any reason.**

This figure is likely to be slightly inaccurate. That said, we can test it's accuracy from DWP publications. From the DWP response on the FOIs, for a just over a two year period (Dec 2011 - Feb 2014; 26 months), [the total deaths while claiming ESA was 50,580.](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/456359/mortality-statistics-esa-ib-sda.pdf). This leads to an annual death total of around 23,300, which is very close to the IB death rate of 1,032 per 100,000. It's uncanny how similar they are as well.

What we need to answer the question: is the rate of death **after the assessment higher?** Let's see what we know:

1,190 per year, or 2,380 over two years, have died after a work assessment ([though this FullFact article says this is an incorrect reporting of the figures](https://fullfact.org/factcheck/economy/fit_for_work_deaths_ESA-47588)). **This is not the same death rate as the 1,032. This is a total deaths.** How do we then turn that into a comparable number to the 1,032? We need the total number of people who have gone through work assessment during that same period and then normalise that figure to reflect deaths per 100,000 people. I haven't found those figures because it's late but if we get that then we can have an actual back of the envelope comparable figure to run with.

--Jenkinson--Tomkins--Reid--Cresswell---

---------------Obiang----Noble--------------------

---------------------Kouyate------------------------

-----------------------Payet-------------------------

-----------Sakho------------------------------------

-------------------------------Valencia--------------

Sakho and Valencia up front are without doubt our best combination of strikers in my opinion. Imagine Payet feeding in those two. Alternate Valencia with Carroll depending on form, because Carroll and Valencia never really clicked as a partnership.

Formation 2 (4-2-3-1)

----------------------Adrian--------------------------------

-----Jenkinson--Tomkins--Reid--Cresswell-----

---------------Kouyate----Noble------------------------

------Lanzini---------Payet---------Sakho-----------

-------------------------Carroll-----------------------------

Lanzini play as an out and out winger because of Jenkinson's limited ability as a defensive full back, Sakho as more of an inside forward. Honestly I think Sakho out wide would totally work, he works so hard and his ball control is amazing, of course it would depend who we were playing, if we do sign Moses I would play Sakho up top and put him on the wing. This is actually my preferred formation surprisingly, given how much we all loved the diamond last year.

It might even allow us to get Valencia, Sakho and Carroll all on the pitch at the same time!

-----Valencia-----Payet-----Sakho-----

----------------------Carroll-------------------



Also, in midfield, if we sign Song as expected, our forward line could look like this, because frankly Noble, Kouyate and Song all HAVE to start.

---------------Kouyate----Noble------------------------

------Lanzini---------Song---------Payet-----------

-------------------------Sakho-----------------------------

Not sure how well Song would operate in that role, but him, Kouyate and Noble could all interchange positions behind those three, as long as we didn't isolate Payet out on the wing. That formation would probably be better suited to two out and out wingers, so maybe switch Lanzini for Moses and Payet for Antonio if we sign them both.",null,0,null,1440976529,null,null,1440977746,0,cul8ihr,null,t3_3j0cxx,null,null,null,t3_3j0cxx,null,null,null,1441595648,null,4,null,Hammers,t5_2sco3,4,null

The fact that YOU are confused doesn't mean that others are.

Well, yes. Thats exactly why I used the words ""I"" and ""me"".

&gt;Now I'm starting to get fucking angry. Because YOU lack the capacity to understand a simple mathematical argument you don't think an urgent inquiry is needed?

Not sure why you'd get ""fucking angry"" because someone whom you've never met didn't quite follow some back of the envelope calculations you did on a reddit post and asked for clarification. And yes, because I didn't understand your maths, I don't understand why an enquiry is needed. Not understanding the logic behind a discussion tends to lead to not understanding the conclusion.

&gt;I'm happy to answer questions about the details of the calculation

Clearly not. You'd rather get all self righteous and huffy instead.

If you'd rather go back to being cordial then the bit I am confused about is you are still comparing the deaths of people within the two week period of an event to the average death rate of a person on disability benefits. These numbers cannot directly be compared and you won't be able to draw and conclusions on cause and effect from them. 

To put it another way all you have done is compare a the death rate within a two week period for one group, with the death rate for a two week period in another group. You haven't factored in the significance of the two week period in question.

Thinking about it though, I think my rundown makes more sense. Feel free to point out where I have gone wrong in my calculation or my conclusion that there is insufficient data to understand what is going on yet.

&gt;but to cast doubt on the idea that an inquiry is needed, when you haven't even made any attempt to understand the argument here, is unbelievable.

Sakho made more mistakes in 13/14 than Lovren did in 14/15, but he had the top end of the pitch to make up for them.However, there's no question that Sakho is better on the ball than Lovren, and again, the stats prove it.",null,0,null,1440977532,null,null,false,0,cul915b,null,t3_3iwbsj,null,null,null,t1_cul7soy,null,null,null,1441595892,null,1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

I was doing well over winter with my hyperpigmentation (sun damage) and even had to change my concealor/ foundation shade. I was using vitamin C (various forms/ products), retinol (Peter Thomas Roth then Ishtar Skinlight) and niacinamide (CeraVe PM, Freederm Daily Complex and others).

The academy are nowhere near ready for the first team so why would they play? Rossiter looked like a kid vs Arsenal. After Sterling, Ibe has been touted as the best player from our youth and he's started poorly so why would we play Ojo when he's ranked even lower than Ibe? 

Markovic however, I believe he shouldn't be loaned. But the overall logic is to play them on loan and see how they develop.

These are three players who have been around Rodgers far more, and in closer proximity, than any of us on this sub have. These are players who have seen his dedication and tactical nouse up close and publicly commented on it.

null,null,LordFirkraag,null,null,null,"Well I'm good at maths so I might have underestimated the difficulty. Let me go again and I'll give more accurate figures this time.

I originally estimated the number of ""fit to work decisions"". Since then I've found the exact figure so we don't need to estimate. **Between December 2011 and February 2014 it's 574,000** rather than 400,000 that I originally gave. [Source is here](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/esa-outcomes-of-work-capability-assessments-september-2014).

The quoted mortality rate for incapacity benefit claimants is **1,032 per 100,000 people per year.**

Let's calculate the expected total number of deaths from December 2011 to February 2014 (a duration of 2.17 years) within 2 week intervals of ""fit to work"" decisions"" while assuming standard mortality rate for incapacity benefit claimants.

Now if a person is as likely to die within one 2 week interval as any other, then we can get the total mortality for 2-weeks following ""fit to work decisions"" for a year by dividing the total expected deaths per year by the number of 2-week intervals in one year, which is 26.  (I can prove this more rigorously if you need but I think you can see the logic: roughly speaking, a person has a probability of dying; it's just as likely within one week as any other if ""fit to work decisions"" are not a factor; total expected deaths within a two-week slice for a population is as good as the sum of dead individuals each in their own randomly taken 2-week interval. ) So we have for total number of deaths in one year:

574,000 x 1,032 / 100,000 x 26 = 227.8

And therefore for a duration of 2.17 years we have:

2.17 x 227.8 = 494.3

**This is the total number of deaths assuming standard mortality rate for incapacity benefit claimants.**

The actual death figure, [quoted in the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/27/thousands-died-after-fit-for-work-assessment-dwp-figures), is 2,380.

So for the excess mortality we get:

2,380 - 494 = 1,886.

So obviously a lot more people have actually died than would be *expected to die* within two-week intervals of a WMA decision assuming standard mortality rate for incapacity benefit claimants.

You are kidding yourself. Vertonghen was the captain of league winning Ajax and made team of the season in his first year, at less than 10m that is an absolute bargain. When was the last Swansea player in team of the season?

Market rate for a world class goal keeper is 12m? you have got to be joking.

Eriksen is one of the best playmakers in the league and cost less than 12m. If you think those are just market value you have a skewed view of the market.

Someone might have a disposition/increased risk of such severe mental illness, but aside from the most obvious risk factors (relatives with an SMI), how can that person or anyone else know that they're necessarily at risk? And would they necessarily develop a full blown diagnosis of schizophrenia otherwise? (i.e. the disposition is there, but it takes something else, like weed, to trigger it).

It's interesting that the debates going on in this thread are pretty measured, I guess because this is a smaller subreddit. I'm impressed. Every time I see a front page discussion related to cannabis, it's always a circlejerk/flamewar of stoners saying weed is fine for anyone and that it doesn't affect anything, even the ability to drive, and on the other side, people saying that will corrupt everyone and that drugs are bad m'kay.

Personally, I'm in favour of some form of decriminalisation (though I'm not a smoker).

He had all but given up by the time Clara got there, admitting to the Daleks that he had no plan. And all of the sudden he got a new set of regenerations, which not only brought back the 11th Doctor's young body via the renewal but perhaps brought back older aspects of the Doctor's character. I find 12 to be more of an honest version of the Doctor in many aspects, not hiding some of the things he hid before and now trying to hide different parts of his personality like sentimental attachment because spending so much time on Trenzalore reminded him that he's not a young man, he's not Clara's boyfriend, and that being a Time Lord means living on while people you love die. So now he's more honest, less attuned to Earth's culture and he's not quick to get attached because he doesn't want to let death bother him.

In brief, 'chemist' is now used to refer to someone who studies chemistry, whereas 'pharmacist' is someone with education in dispensing medicine. The old use of 'chemist' was due to the fact that, not too long ago, many pharmacists would have been trained chemists as well, concocting their own medicines out of raw ingredients in the shop. Nowadays, actual chemists at Pfizer and Merck are formulating the medicines, and the pharmacists just dispense them. Hence the change in title.

The ones that really get on my tits are:

* Elevator instead of lift - I am hearing this more and more, and I hate it. Why use a longer, clunkier word in place of one that means the same thing?

* I do miss the term 'railway station'. It just sounds slightly classier to my ear.

""I don't want to pay for a TV license!"" **WRONG! IT IS TV LICENCE. LICENCE IS USED AS A NOUN**

""I need to practice more.""  **INCORRECT. PRACTISE IS THE VERB.**

Examples:

* ""The DVLA license people to drive by issuing driving licences.""

* ""I need to practise my spelling, so I will buy a spelling practice book.""

I can only assume that British schools have completely and totally stopped teaching this disctinction, because on **every fucking thread** about the TV Licence, *at least* 60% of the spelling in there is 'TV License' and it fucking kills me.

10m a lot for Lyon? Lyon who won the league over and over from 2000-2010. Were perennial CL quarter and even semi finalists? Lyon who were so good at making money they financed a stadium, they also sold talent like Abidal, Diarra, Essien, Pjanic, Malouda, Lacazette and Benzema. Lyon are a massive club with insane success since 2000, famed for dominating the French league, showcasing and selling amazing players into Europe. 10m is not a lot for them.

If you think 12m is a decent fee for Eriksen there is nothing useful I can say to you. The only reason we got him was because he has a good head on his shoulders and wanted to continue developing rather than rot on Barca/Dortmunds bench.

-------------------Adrian

Tomkins----Reid--Ogbonna---Cresswell

----------Kouyate/Song---Noble

Lanzini----------Payet---------Jarvis/Moses or whichever winger we sign

-------------------Sakho/whoever we sign, if better

&amp;nbsp;

The thing is, we've actually got a good bit of depth at the back and in midfield, though we'd have to create most of it by using players out of their natural/most effective position(s). I just hope Collins doesn't leave, which is why I suggest we keep using Tomkins at RB (he fully deserves to start no matter what IMO); it'll make it seem like Collins still has a shot at making it into the lineup, and also pressure Jenko to work on his game and get that form going. He was excellent last season but I feel he was definitely not worth the 3m+ just to get him on loan again.. could have gone for a cheaper, more permanent option. But I hope he proves me wrong and makes a comeback, always great to have competition in the squad while maintaining good morale and chemistry between the players who click with each other and start most often. We need quality partnerships through the core of the starting XI, which means CBs, CMs, and anyone up front.

&amp;nbsp;

Regarding the CMs, Kouyate is quite versatile (most CMs really should be, especially box-to-box, but I feel like he's the type of player that can excel at CDM and CAM as well.. but obviously Payet's got that position on lock ;) ) and can both push up and defend well. I've mostly liked what I've seen from Obiang thus far but Kouyate is still ahead of him in the pecking order, and Noble has been quality despite what people may say about him (he had the highest pass completion rate at Anfield, I think, and he's gotten in on the goals already). The question will be whether Song will live up to the expectations, based on his performances in the first half of last season in particular, or if he's dropped in quality due to the injury and lack of match fitness, etc. But hopefully he can at the very least still be useful to us. If he finds his form and stays fit, he and Obiang could compete for a spot in this lineup.. four quality options in the middle, really pleased with this. Reece Oxford is also excellent considering his age, but despite his outstanding performance at the Emirates, he isn't ready to be starting or even getting too many minutes in the PL considering the depth we're going to have in the middle with Song joining the side. He could and should still feature in cup games and occasionally come off the bench in the league in certain games, which is more than any 16 year old footballer at a PL club should expect (even though his natural position is CB, he does perform his role well as a CDM, CM). I also really like Josh Cullen, should get some more opportunities in the future as well.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, the strikers.. I love Sakho despite all the talk about him early on, think he deserves to be our main striker, and a set starter in this formation. Andy is excellent in the air despite all of his misgivings, and if he stays fit, he could be a real asset to us as well. So I'd alternate between these two in this formation, or try using them together in a 2-striker formation (perhaps 4-3-1-2), or switch AC for Valencia when fit and in form to play alongside Sakho given their partnership could be fruitful as well. Or of course, depending on who we sign, a different pairing could be attempted.. one thing I'd like to reiterate is that we should really use AC in games where we'd expect to win the aerial duels and could take advantage of corners and crosses into the box with Andy winning these and hopefully bagging them..

&amp;nbsp;

Another point that really pleases me is our keeper situation. Most of us expected Randolph to be awful based on his preseason performances and his past.. however he's been fantastic thus far, which is great for his confidence and will also help to keep Adrian on his toes. Spiegel also a rising member of the squad, made a quality save vs WB in preseason, decent young third option.

null,null,LordFirkraag,null,null,null,"&gt; , I'm just here to point out that dismissing as invalid the political views of the largest share of the last electorate is quite extraordinary and I'm genuinely baffled at your thought process.

United Russia has the largest share of the electorate. Nazism was exceedingly popular in its day as were the KKK. Persecuting Catholics rather than the poor and disabled used to be very popular in this country. Believe it or not, but popularity isn't a signifier of whether something is good. 

&gt; Can you really not comprehend that tory voters might just be real people who want the best for their country?

The same is true of all sorts of unpleasant groups.

In the present day Tories I see a cult of greed, a religion of money, a restoration of the aristocracy, a war being waged on the poorest, an attempt to dismantle the welfare state.

And they're even worse. For one thing they're the most effective propagandists the country has ever reckoned with. The media monopoly that they have was described by David Axelrod as more partisan than Fox News. Think of what the means: the*majority* of the UK media is worse than Fox News according to someone who was in a very good position to know.

&gt; To have so much conviction in any belief you must ask yourself questions like these at some point, what are your answers? Or do you avoid answering them?

I find them to be quite laughable because they would apply to every group -- the BNP, neo-Nazis, everyone -- with just as much weight as Tories.

We bought him because our coaches thought he could be good for us in the future, and upon seeing him more on loan and in training have decided that he hasn't got what it takes or the player himself doesn't want to be here. Simple. 

Not every player works and it's unreasonable to think they should, but that doesn't mean we stop taking the risk of buying players. Happens everywhere, that's football. I'm as disappointed as you are if he goes ; had high hopes.

It's great that we've got entirely unexpected and perhaps more than adequate cover for the RB position this season, but can you really imagine Tomkins running up and down the wing whipping in balls by the corner flag?

I think Carroll and Sakho are about the same in terms of what they bring when they are both fit, but Valencia/Sakho just clicked beautifully, I can even remember some of us were comparing them to Cottee/McAvennie at one point. I also remember some people saying that Downing+Jarvis whipping balls in to Carroll = success. Yes, Payet and Lanzini easily &gt; Downing and Jarvis, but sometimes it's not as simple as that.

Payet's set piece delivery is the best I've seen at West Ham since I've been going though, so the thought of those wonderful corners and free kicks with Carroll in the box is indeed very exciting.

You're entirely right about the depth we have as well.

null,null,jimmy17,null,null,null,"I'm not sure this is right. You seemed to have mixed a few things up.

The number of people who were deemed fit for work was 574,000 (I assume, you didn't make it clear if this was the number of assessments in total of the number of people found to be fit for work) over a 2.17 year period so for your calculation on the number of deaths per year to work, you need to adjust this to the number of people deemed fit for work in 1 year. I'll show you my steps:

574,000 people were found fit to work over a 2.17 year period. So 574,000/2.17 gives the number of people found fit to work in a 1 year period:

574,000/2.17 = 264,516

So 264,516 people were found to be fit for work in 1 year.

With a mortality rate of 1,032 per 100,000 per year you would expect the number of deaths in this one year to be as follows:

(1032/100,000)*264,156 = 2,726

So we expect there to be 2,726 deaths per year within this group.

Dividing this by 26 gives you the number of deaths in any 2 week period:

2726/26 = 104.8.

Now at this point I don't know why you multiplied by 2.17. Multiplying the number of deaths in a 2 week period by 2.17 simply gives you the number of deaths in 4.34 weeks.

What you need to do is multiply 104.8 by the number of 2 week periods in 2.17 years which is done as follows:

2.17*26 = 56.42

So if we multiply these 56.42 two week periods by the number of deaths in a two weeks we get the expected number of deaths in the 2.17 years.

56.42 * 104.8 = 5,867.

Now importantly I don't think all of the guff is necessary in the middle. You are simply going around in circles with this calculation. A simpler way to do it would be to take the number of deaths expected per year as we worked out earlier (2,726) and multiply this by 2.17 to give the expected number of deaths in a 2.17 year period:

2,726*2.17 = 5,915

Basically the same as I calculated before but with rounding errors I assume.

Now this is actually much LARGER than the number of people who have died according to these news articles. The reason this is probably the case is that we were only counting the number of people who died within a two week period of their assessment. I imagine many more people died during this period who didn't die within two weeks of an assessment.

Your HR can't help, only a ""stop notice"" instruction from HMRC allows your company to stop PAYE deductions. HMRC will only issue that when informed by SLC.

Despite my planning and almost monthly calls to all three I was still under salary deductions for half a year after repaying. First an SLC mistake, secondly my employer delayed communications with their outsourced payroll. I had to get SLC and HMRC in a phone conference to agree on what had happened in the past to resolve it. Eventually got it settled and sent a letter with payslip copies to get a BACS refund from SLC, but would've saved time if I'd contacted SLC much earlier to stop PAYE deductions.

As /u/dreaming_of_whistler said, you can opt to stop PAYE if you're forecast to repay in the next two years (noting that IIRC it's still the case that SLC is only notified about your actual repayments tax annually).",null,0,null,1440983445,null,null,false,0,culc3kl,null,t3_3iyoor,null,null,null,t3_3iyoor,null,null,null,1441597337,null,2,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

SQUAD BUILDING: 145m net spend under BR, transformed an aging, upper mid-table squad to a young, almost top-4 contender-calbre squad. (bandying around the 200m or 300m+ figure is ridiculous once you realise how much we got from selling Suarez/Sterling and how important they were for us)

 Between Spurs, City, United, Arsenal, Chelsea, only Arsenal has clearly done better. Spurs ran around in circles going nowhere, United has spent an enormous amount, City regressed last season, Chelsea bought plenty of duds and seem vulnerable this season.

Overall rating: Average or above average depending on how well our young players develop (Can, Markovic, Moreno, Gomez, Origi make up roughly 50m of our spending and almost certainly will improve)

In general, you can see why there are fans on both sides of the fences. In all likelihood, most fans feel like BR hasn't done enough to be the man for the job, but he hasn't done badly enough to lose it as well. I personally think that this current season is his make-or-break season.

1st season, transition season. 2nd season, BR proved that he could give us top 4, 3rd season, our squad actually worsened and the squad's collapse at the end of the season left a sour note in all of us. 

This season, our squad is nearly top 4 calibre - if we make top 4, BR will be acknowledged to be the man, if we mount a serious challenge, fans will still be split (since BR is supposed to bring us top 4 without top 4 resources) , and anything worse will see almost everyone turn against BR.",null,0,null,1440983872,null,null,false,0,culcc54,null,t3_3izjgz,null,null,null,t3_3izjgz,null,null,null,1441597449,null,2,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

Azp plays very well on the left tucking in with jt, and is an amazing player even though he is not on his natural side. And up until recently and somewhat at times last season brana has been exposed at times. But he still provides a role in the team of possessing good passing and chemistry with our midfield players and is the target of most of our goal kicks, as well as his presence in both penalty areas in the air. That all coupled with his veteran status at the club are all due reason for him to have not be benched so far, and while it is still to be seen whether or not he is dropped vs Everton. Also, baba may not be ready for the premier league, who knows. We do not see him train every day, or know where he is at with his fitness/general form. Whether or not brana has to be dropped, other areas retooled, or a tactical change in his play whatever we are doing on the right now isn't working and must improve along with the general play of the team.

null,null,LordFirkraag,null,null,null,"God, what an annoying person you are. That's the second post of yours in which fail to understand the argument yet make very confident statements about it.

&gt; What you need to do is multiply 104.8 by the number of 2 week periods in 2.17 years which is done as follows:

No you don't do this. This would give you simply the TOTAL death figures for ALL intervals in the 2.17 years. Which is not what we want at all.

What we want is the death figure for a SINGLE two week interval in a year times the number of years. Because we're considering deaths two weeks *from* the ""fit to work"" decision for each individual. 

If the probability of a single death within such an interval is p, and the total population is N, then Np deaths will occur within intervals of fit to work decisions. The total number of deaths in a single two-week interval is m/26, where m is the mortality rate for the population in a year. But m = 26pN. Thus the expected total deaths within a two-week interval assuming uniform mortality rate within a year following a ""fit to work decision"" is given by m/26. 

You could have seen that your calculation of 5,915 was way off the mark for deaths within 2 week intervals by multiplying it by 26. You get 153,800 people dying. This is a factor of more than 10 off what is predicted by the mortality rate for incapacity benefit claimants. 

&gt; Now importantly I don't think all of the guff is necessary in the middle. You are simply going around in circles with this calculation. A simpler way to do it would be to take the number of deaths expected per year as we worked out earlier (2,726) and multiply this by 2.17 to give the expected number of deaths in a 2.17 year period:

""Proelia"" is the nominative plural (also accusative and vocative), which wouldn't be used with ""in.""  (""Superbia"" is singular, on the other hand, ending in ""a"" because it's a female noun)

The phrase ""non semper in proeliis"" (not always in battles) uses the plural ablative, showing that it is the case used correctly with ""in"".

null,null,Project-Badass,null,null,null,"Well, a great manager would know how to turn the result for once. He's not a horrible manager, but the mentality of our squad makes me doubt him more and more. If you look at previous managerial spells (Except for Hodgson's of course) you won't ever see a team that lost 3-0 at Anfield, or lost 6-1 to a mid-table team. We always had the spirit to hold on, we always had the ability to turn tables, but now once we concede a goal, we just keep conceding more. Hell, even yellow and the red cards are more than before. It was a weird season when a Liverpool player got sent off once, and now it happens more than often. Players make errors constantly. They're not mentally prepared for a fight. 
If you talk about the team now, we have a good team. Not due to great transfers but for buying lots of players, and a few had to work out in the end after spending that fortune. I've seen weaker Liverpool squads perform better than this team.

I'm surprised that some people use players' words as a reference. What do you expect a player to say about his manager? ""He isn't good enough.""? Of course he's going to praise him to get credit to stay in the team or to make the team, so their words don't make any difference because they are biased. 
You can also see that when we try to bring in a big name. They just don't think he's good enough. If we had a better manager with a better reputation, we would have got a couple of the deals we lost. Only our players think he's good. How weird is that.

It's like we, as Liverpool fans, got used to being optimistic about everything and hoping that some way it will work out in the end. We always find excuses and hope that the next game is going to be different. We got used to settling for mediocrity.

Again, he's not a horrible manager and he has some good traits, but he's not good enough for Liverpool.

The other point the article makes is that in 2010/2011, we spent 240 million dollars on players. Assuming that's true and most of them were 5 year contracts, they were being amortized from 2010-2015 and this year they will be off our books so we have space to add new transfers and because this years spending is less than 2010-2011, overall its a net gain.
