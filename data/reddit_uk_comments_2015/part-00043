i must say, people forget how good he was at arsenal, and how he is always regarded as an ""attacking"" center back. he fits our system and although he lacks pace in his older age, could play that middle cb position as a sub. i think we sign him on another year deal, his presence is needed. i mean look at how he backs up the younger players in the squad too..he always stands up for raheem, phil, balo, and the summer signings. he is a positive guy and he is definitely one of the more liked guys in the locker room because of his happy personality.

FSG picked BR to be the players boss, and if they don't like his decisions, then give him some food for thought in training. br asked for mental strength from sahko when he dropped him to put his head down and keep working hard, and that is exactly what he got out of sahko, and look at how freaking good he's been playing. 

it worked with mignolet, it worked with raheem(although his case is a little different), it worked with downing (who talked so much shit about BR because he's a pussy), it worked borini (to an extent) so i mean if you don't play, BR pushes you to be work harder in training, which brings the level of the team up. any player, at any time, can be dropped and they need to know that. they're being paid millions of pounds to perform and if they don't, the coach has every right to drop them. no player is entitled to their spot in the starting XI, except bar sturridge when healthy at this moment. other than that, no player is going to be immune to the drop in my opinion, not even raheem because we have so many options up front now.

Br is doing a great job at getting the best out of players again and is proving his salt. i think he was a bit stubborn sticking with the system in the first half of the season, but who wouldn't? the 3-4-3 is extremely risky and very hard to run properly and takes a long time to implement. it's not a very common system to play in, and many players have little to no experience at the top level playing in it. this is why we couldn't have magically switched to it earlier in the year. I do think, though, that a 4-3-3 would have benefitted the team, with a large focus of the attack coming from the wings and service into balotelli or lambert. but that's just my opinion. im just glad we found something that's working now, and it's just in time for a huge push for top 3...we're only 5 points out of those places.

The article confirms this by saying we shared the information &amp; tipped off the British authorities routinely about this stuff.

**It's the British government which ignored &amp; covered it up, not us which withheld the information.**

The CIA is a intelligence agency meant to push American national interests. Our alliance with the British government is in those interests. Ensuring that the British government isn't full of intelligence leaks &amp; easily manipulated individuals is important.

The British government deciding to ignore that information &amp; cover-it-up itsn't the CIA's fault.

Sure, you can say the CIA not going over the British government, defying our alliance &amp; unilaterally taking actions against British individuals, for British crimes, on British soil was something they should've done, but than again, that's not the CIA's mandate or responsibility to do that. 

The alliance with Britain, as fucked up as it sounds, isn't worth a couple pedos in the CIA's view. To do something would require going over the British government's head, on their own territory, and directly interfering with their government, sovereignty &amp; internal administration without their permission or consent.

It seems to have a pretty bohemian area, which Leeds lacks. These aren't spectacular things to note but they are things the guardian's missed.

null,false,dkcork,null,null,null,"The thing is, a team can only win the league if they get an influx of money. Look at the winners since the PL's inception. The only winners are Arsenal, Man Utd, Man City, Chelsea and Blackburn, in 23 years. There are 4 teams there that are still spending big, along with Blackburn, who won their title due to Jack Walker's riches. It has never happened that a surprise team, without a large increase in cash reserves, has managed to win the league. Sad to say, but this isn't Roy of the Rovers and a team like us won't win the league without either a) money or b) an incredible output from our academy. 

This could be put down as a failing of the current league system, which results in smaller teams never getting a chance.  In a way, I prefer the system in North American sports, where you get high draft picks when your team finishes in a low position. At least that gives you a chance to improve .But currently, rich teams buy all the best players and all the good youth players as well. There is no compensation if you finish low...you just end up with lower prize money, which increases the gap even further! 


 To be honest, I think perhaps your outlook on this has a lot to do with you being from America, because you often see struggling teams turn it around and making the Stanley Cup final or Superbowl in American sports. I mean, the Kings were really not good last year but still ended up winning the cup. You know taht better than most, the Sharks should have swept them! The Avalanche were predicted to come close to last and they ended up being great (though they are now shit again). In the British Isles, we don't ever see a bad team suddenly doing amazing, so that is probably why you perceive me to be somewhat pesimistic. But it isn't that I lack ambition..I would love West Ham to win the league, but I am realistic and I don't want to get my hopes up, because I will be even more disappointed when things don't go our way. The saddest part of all is that it is almost better in a way if a team doesn't over-achieve in the Premier League. Anytime a team does better than expected, the bigger teams just buy up all their best talent. Happens all the time and it is frustrating as hell.


On the topic of Southampton, they did have a more dire recent history than us, but they also had an insane crop of youth players all come good at the same time. They went down to League 1 and had to rebuild from the roots up, focussing on youth players, while we were giving the likes of Benny McCarthy a job. They are selling on these youth players for massive profit now, and they still have more players coming through. Our academy has been pretty poor in the last few years. But I still don't expect them to stay up there and finish 4th. Arsenal and Spurs will end up overtaking them and they will finish 6th or maybe even 7th if Liverpool pull things together now they have Sturridge back.


Finally, you ask why we support West Ham if we don't believe they will win every game. Well...I hope we win every game! Expecting them to win every game is ridiculous though. You won't ever be satisfied if you always demand a win. Supporting West Ham, for me, is about those little moments of joy. Like beating Liverpool and Man City. Like escaping relagation or winning in the playoff final. Supporting West Ham is a rollercoaster that I never want to get off of. And I wrote this post to remind people that we have achieved a lot this year so far. I think we all would have  have accepted us being in this position, if offered to us at the start of the year, and it is important not to forget that we are doing great. Granted, we could be doing a bit better if we dropped Nolan but there are 15 games left, let's see what we can do.

In all honesty, I don't think any of them are odds on to make it, as Courtois looked at one point during his Atletico career, though I'd probably wager Thorgan is closest.

Here's a bit on each of the ones I've watched lately:

- Thorgan seems to be developing well at Monchengladbach, though I think he's still some distance away from breaking into our squad. Mourinho commented on the prospect of having him back not so long ago, so that's a plus. Monchengladbach's attempts to purchase him outright is testament to his quality.

- Traore would apparently be in our squad if he was eligible for a work permit, though I'm not sure if Mourinho was serious. People tend to forget he's only 19, and only on the lower end - age wise - of our loanees. I watched him play against Ajax this weekend and he was very impressive; he has the talent to make it.

- Chalobah looked like the real deal during his loan spell at Watford, then got a 35k a week contract and fell off the board. The original plan was to have him back at the beginning of this season, but given the relatively unsuccessful loan spells he's had after Watford, you get the impression he's trying to resuscitate any the slim chances he has at making it.

- Piazon was superb at Vitesse for the beginning of last season before losing his form after January. He seems to be struggling in the Bundesliga given his inability to physically impose himself, which seems to be a problem given the physical nature of the Premier League.

- Van Ginkel has been average at Milan, where's he struggling to get past Muntari in the pecking order, which probably doesn't bode well for his chances here. Besides one pass to Destro in the game against Parma yesterday, he was pretty abject throughout.

&gt;__Alicia Esteve Head__  (born July 31, 1973)  is a [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain) woman who claimed to be a survivor of the [World Trade Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center) [September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) under the name __Tania Head__. She joined the World Trade Center Survivors' Network support group, later becoming its president. Her name was regularly mentioned in media reports of the attacks. In 2007, it was revealed her story was fabricated: Head was not a September 11 survivor, nor was she even in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) on that day.

The reactions to the supposedly sexist prisons policy, which seems to be deliberately missing the point that it's evidence and statistics based and takes into account the findings of an independent report, is also making more likely to join the Green party, as it smells of red pill bullshit.

Would you mind giving me some statistics showing this? To me this smells like feminist bullshit.

 You do realise that there are separate male and female prisons with different procedures etc? They seem to be working just fine for women at the moment - ""Women have a significantly higher percentage of successful completions than men (95.0% for females and 75.8% for males) in 2013/14. ""

Also, at the moment an average cost for a years stay in prison is ""£36,808"" and for a female ""£56,415""
How do women receive worse treatment in prison? If that's the case then surely we should be addressing the actual prisons rather than giving women a jet out of free card so they can go to their cozy custodial centres. That's just avoiding the problem.

null,false,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,null,"How much would you pay teachers?

I actually think the salary is fair considering the requirements to become a teacher, and there are progression opportunities. 

UK median salary is only 26k or so, so a newly qualified teacher earns more than nearly 50% of the population. I think part of the problem is the high cost of living makes it feel like a 20-30k salary isn't enough. Where on that spectrum should a newly qualified teacher be? Doctors if I recall correctly start on mid 30s whilst their doing their residency.

Or maybe accountants? After 3 years of 60 hour weeks all year round (they have to do exams and work) they'll be on around 40k basic. 

Or shall we go further? Maybe 50k starting salary for teaching, putting them around the salary for a senior developer or manager with a lot of experience and responsibility for 6-7 figures of budget.

I think when the issue of pay comes up teachers feel like everyone else is getting paid more, but it's not the case. Look at nurses, they start on 18k and have to work on rotating shifts which we know contributes to stress and burnout. They also spend longer specialising to become a nurse than it takes to be a teacher. What about ambulance paramedics? 15-16k or thereabouts and again, similar training requirements and the job is likely to be more difficult.

Teachers make an okay salary for the requirements of the role, if after a few years they feel it's not progressed they can move to the private education sector which pays more, or of they're not capable of getting a role they can try to transfer their skills to another industry.",null,0,null,1422904220,null,0,false,0,co8yyfe,null,t3_2ui4nt,null,t1_co8yyfe,null,t1_co8woru,null,null,null,1424251707,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Wrong example of Leeds, Leeds bought several players together and sank. We need one match winner apart from Daniel. Try harder. 

Examples? Mandzukič. Exactly what we need. Fantasies? This isn't Chelsea fc. I'm talking about players within our reach and affordability. Someone who can deliver now. Not even talking world class level. 

Not Ricky fucking Lambert. Or Danny fucking Ings. 

In your head buying  a good player is shopping in the Chelsea or city mold. In my head it is the Lyon mold or the Athletico mold. 

There are several ways to win in this transfer business. Porto, Lyon, Athletico, Dortmund etc. have nailed it. We choose to remain the court jesters, the buffoons of the window. Yet another window passes by while we have our head in the clouds. All it will take is one bad patch of form for Mignolet or one injury to our main striker to fuck things up. 

But no. It's all delusional wanting smart buys who can deliver today.

As somebody who works in genetic engineering these are still unacceptably and incredibly economically damaging policies. A lot of our understanding of genetic disease comes from the ability to genetically engineer human genes and most of the work relies on genetic tools that are patented and took a huge amount of research and development. 

It's a lose lose situation to suggest this as a policy, as akin to the Green's policy on animal testing it merely shifts the ""problem"" out of Britain and shifts the economic gain with it. 

The world is not a better place if we ban animal testing and genetic engineering in the UK (which is currently more ethical in the UK than anywhere else in the world) and just buy the products of animal testing and genetic engineering in from other countries (who might not be so ethically rigourous). All these policies do is make us poorer and the world a slightly worse place, but allow us to brag about how ethical we are.

Pairing Anichebe and Berahino gives them pace and strength together; Ideye seemed to offer medium amounts of each and therefore didn't play well off of either Anichebe or Berahino (to say nothing for his lack of clinical finishing ability at this level).

Oh, and just so this post has some semblance of Spurs talk to it: No Berahino, please, or at least not in January.

The recent focus on these rumours is just indulgence from the media-mob.  You are right about ""the people protecting him"", this is the key to the whole issue.  There must have been dozens of conscious, professional adults (TV production crew, nurses in the hospitals he ""visited"") who had first-hand actual evidence, not just third-hand rumours, who both: a) could, and b) should have done something about it.

No-one seems interested in this angle though, we only want to hear the still-sensational rumours and conspiracy theories about his friendships with politicians and royalty; it's a bit too depressing and mundane to think of all the normal people who could have brought Savile to justice, but instead chose a quiet life and turned a blind-eye.",null,0,null,1422905811,null,0,false,0,co8zwmq,null,t3_2uinit,null,t1_co8zwmq,null,t1_co8u7i1,null,null,null,1424251263,null,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24,null

I think the Greens know what's going on, but want to focus on the 'people getting more' side. Most policies around a Minimum Income/Negative Income Tax approach necessarily require the replacement of a wide range of benefits with the new income. What is usually left to the small print is that it also replaces a wide range of tax credits, too - including things which aren't traditionally viewed as a tax credit, like the personal allowance. 

Correctly designed, this should not make most people any worse off. Considering withdrawing the personal allowance: someone earning over the 10k threshold will pay about 3k more tax if NI and income tax started at 0 income, but will then get a similar amount back in minimum income payments (if paid at £60-70 per week). So individuals paying over the income tax threshold shouldn't see any significant difference in their take-home income, despite this representing nearly £100Bn in extra taxation and spending. Similar observations apply to a whole range of other tax credits and benefits, which serves to dramatically reduce the budget shortfall from the initial eye-watering figures if you just count up the outgoings.

It's a fundamentally different approach to both social security and taxation, and I think the Greens really should have kept hammering this home to illustrate just how sweeping a reform it would be. However, they just didn't seem prepared to do that, and telling everyone you're going to increase their taxes by several thousand pounds isn't really a vote-winner, even if you're going to give it right back to most of them.

(The obvious follow-up question is 'what's the point of taking £3k from every worker just to give it straight back to them?', but that digs down into the philosophy of the approach, rather than its actual feasibility).",null,0,null,1422906390,null,0,false,0,co908zc,null,t3_2ui7ef,null,t1_co908zc,null,t1_co8x6rx,null,null,null,1424251103,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

I would say we've proved to be a rather risk-adverse and calm nation and as such I don't think a radical new political party would take it's place. Instead you'll probably just have new centre right and left parties forming from the ashes or see UKIP and the Greens move towards to centre to order to capture the vast amount of moderates that'll be in play. 

That said you're not going to get every political figure caught on in this and I don't see senior royals getting dragged in.

null,false,JackXDark,null,null,null,"&gt; Ok, well statistically black people are more likely to commit a crime and end up in jail than white people. Should we therefore make some generalised rule where black people are judged quicker, harder or in any other way different from other races?

That's something 'everyone knows' right? Except it's not true. Your premise depends on *where* you're applying the statistic to and what sort of crimes. And also how you're reporting the statistics. There are far more white people in prison in the UK than black people. 

The proportions of black/white people in prison are disproportionate as percentages of the whole, sure, but again, the crucial question is *why* and also what do you do about it?

Are black people about 4% more prone to crime than white people just because they're black? No. It's because of the social conditions they tend to be from. They're more likely to commit crime because their backgrounds are poor housing and deprived areas and lack of local amenities and opportunities. 

There *are* police and social and health initiatives to address crime in inner-city areas that tend to have more black people living there. Operation Trident was one. Was this racist? It was certainly accused of it, in the same way that the Green party's prisons policy is being accused of being sexist. But was it also an attempt to use statistics and evidence to address an identified issue. Arguably, absolutely yes.

That's why you're wrong about this, and why your comments about black people and crime are at best ill-informed, and at worst, racist themselves.

Its actually got me now wishing I had a box to try this now. Not because I want to steal sky - I really don't watch TV much anymore &amp; when I do its BBC - but because I'd like to see what I could / couldn't get working.

&gt; As has card-sharing. It's trivial to buy a box and 12 month C-line from eBay that's just plug and play for less than a ton. No HD though. Not that I'd recommend it, obviously. Ahem.

I believe this is the same change you alluded to before. Having looked into it it appears the communication with the cards is now encrypted. However - it appears current cards will fall back to unencrypted communication if the encrypted communication fails.

Also the cards get sent the public key of the box when first inserted. So if you lifted the private key off the box or just set up the card server to pair with its own ""fake"" key pair then you should have no issue. I expect its a case of the card servers playing catchup - or just being lazy &amp; deciding the hassle isn't worth it / customers are happy enough without HD.

&gt; I'd be tempted to keep paying the £10 a month and see where we are in another year or two. Right now, as neither the box nor OP are broke, I don't think I'd change.

Meh. I'm just stingy I suppose. Sky clearly state they are selling you the box when you ""buy"" freesat HD. So it just seems like insanity that you have to pay them money for it to do something for which it has no external dependencies.

In the past few years I've, however, learned to love my neutrals and products that give me that extra bit of confidence.

Sorry about that rambling, hah, I'm just a bit excited since I've never really bought a lot of makeup at the same time but went and get what I needed. My way might be better in the long run but you can have a little splurge once in a while, can't you?

And to answer your questions: like I said, neutral colors and good quality products. I like my BB creams and concentrate more on my eyes than my lips. I'd like to find a go-to lip product and I'm going to test Revlon's lip butters out like someone here suggested.

null,false,ZombieWomble,null,null,null,"&gt; How are the government going to afford £280 billion when we are trying to cut our deficit, not expand it? 

This was the point I was making - the government absolutely *does not* need to afford £280 billion extra spending, because the minimum income is designed to replace huge swathes of existing benefit spending and tax credits which are trying to achieve the same result. Replacing pensions and personal allowances with the minimum income would cover about £170 billion of the cost, without anyone getting any substantive reduction in net income. 

[Citizen's income trust](http://www.citizensincome.org/FAQs.htm) has a fully costed minimum income policy, based on the 09/10 budget, under the 'is it affordable' FAQ. A little over half the cost comes from replacement of existing benefits and about a third from the removal of income tax credits and allowances, and the remainder from the removal of some savings tax credits. The latter point makes it a bit hard on higher-earners, but the vast majority of the cost (about 5/6 in this example) is met simply by moving money around between different types of government spending without particularly affecting any individual's income. 

The devil is, as always, in the details, but suggestions that the Greens are suggesting increasing the deficit by a quarter of a trillion pounds are very misleading.",null,0,null,1422909295,null,0,false,0,co921hr,null,t3_2ui7ef,null,t1_co921hr,null,t1_co90tuf,null,null,null,1424250267,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

null,false,FlatTextOnAScreen,null,null,null,"Andrea Dossena: Destiny Fulfilled 

"" When Andrea Dossena was a little boy growing up in Lodi, northern Italy, he would spend hours sat cross legged outside the cathedral on the historic Piazza della Vittoria, telling strangers how he would change the world one day, many miles away from where he now sat, in March 2009. Of course, the strangers laughed at the claims of the little boy and told him to go to school. “A correre e cagare ci si immerda i garretti,” the young Andrea would snap back. ‘By running and ************ at the same time will result in a mess.’ The strangers grew tired of the boy’s insolence and started telling him in no uncertain terms that he was deluded. “Can che abbaia non morde,” the old man who sold rosaries outside the catherdral told him. ‘The dog that barks doesn’t bite.’ Quick as a flash, Andrea would shout: “Fatti i cazzi tuoi vecchi testicoli, ca campi cent’anni.” ‘Mind your own business old ******** and you’ll live 100 years.’ Growing tired of being called ‘old bollocks’ by the young man, even the rosary seller stopped talking to him. Andrea was left alone with his thoughts.

On July 2008, Dossena arrived at Anfield for £7m and a plan a lifetime in the making was beginning to come together. The first part was to make everyone think he was *****. It was at this that he truly excelled, managing to look like a plumber who had won a competition to be a Premier League player for the day. ***** first touch. ***** passing range. ***** at tackling. Dossena managed to make Paul Konchesky look good. Well maybe not, but you get the idea. He was just really ******* ***** all the time and of course he became a bit of a joke for being so *****. And this is what a lot of people, nay, everyone (except me and Andrea Dossena) don’t appreciate; he was trying to look ***** on PURPOSE. For a laugh. He told me as much when I travelled to Naples to talk to him but I’ll get to that later.

March 2009. You may remember it for China’s first lunar probe impacting the moon. I don’t. I remember it for a ******* bat**** mental week when Liverpool beat Real Madrid 4-0 and Man United 4-1. But above and beyond this, I remember it for Andrea Dossena. For a week, he was the best player in the world. He was doing Cruyff turns and ******* Lionel Messi dribbles past World Cup winners Sergio Ramos and Fabio Cannavaro. At one point he attempted an overhead kick from HIS OWN HALF, which flashed inches past Iker Casillas’ goal. He then scored a beauty in the 87th minute. One touch. Bang. Pick that out Casillas you ****, it seemed to say. And here’s the thing. He had predicted this TWENTY years ago. On the steps of the cathedral on the Piazza della Vittoria. When he lobbed Edwin Van Der Sar in the 90th minute with a swish of that wand of a left foot, you can clearly see Dossena mouth to the camera “that one’s for you old bollocks”. I remember crying when he scored. Because Dossena had purposefully hoodwinked everyone into thinking he was absolutely ***** when in fact he was the best player in the world and by some margin. I cried at the remarkable beauty of it.

June 2011. Naples. When I travelled to the Avvocato district to research this piece, everyone I met had something to say about Dossena. Most often, I would hear him described as a ‘visionario’. In a little coffee shop on the Piazza Dante, Professor Paolo Vittorio explained to me the impact of Dossena’s conscious choice to showcase his sublime skills for just 36 minutes, over two substitute appearances against two of the biggest clubs in the world. “Andrea knew from a very early age he was blessed with a God-given talent,” Vittorio told me in impeccable English. “But he was very modest. Too modest. Rather than play beautiful football week in, week out, he decided that the best thing he could do was to condense all of his skills into essentially what was a 36-minute cameo, spread over two matches.”

When I finally met Dossena, at Napoli’s training ground, I was tense. Who wouldn’t be. I had been told by the Napoli press officer that I was to have no more than two minutes with the Italian and there was so much I wanted to ask him. When he arrived, Dossena was intense and enigmatic. He told me he still watched English football when he could and that he missed the atmosphere in the English grounds. He joked that he even missed being called a “*****, bald ******”. But when I asked him about his premonition, his face turned very serious and he held me with a powerful gaze.

“I’m from a large Catholic family. My mother and father, they worked very hard so that I could have football boots and kit. They worked from seven in the morning until eight at night. I respect them for their sacrifice. When my father saw the talent I had in my left foot, he told me that it would be wrong to humiliate the other players. He said I should let myself have one week where I show my talent but no more than this. This is why I chose the week we played Real Madrid and United. But seriously, I had always known that March 2009 would be the time. To coincide with the first Chinese lunar probe landing on the moon.” With that, Dossena shook my hand and left. I knew I’d been in the presence of greatness. And the best part is, now that I can tell his story, maybe people will finally realise what a very special talent Andrea Dossena was."" - Surreal Football",null,0,null,1422910217,null,0,false,0,co92lv4,null,t3_2uibf0,null,t1_co92lv4,null,t1_co8xqog,null,null,null,1424250003,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

null,false,Darneil,cnty-wales,Cardiff,null,"&gt; It is a common misconception that any scoped rifle is a sniper rifle, and while certain long guns are more suited for the application than others, it is the act of using a weapon strategically as a sniper that designates it as such.

What if they're renting and aren't allowed to smoke in their house? What if they don't have access to a garden? Not to mention people from out of town and people who work in buildings with no space out back for smoking.

There are many places where people cannot smoke, but the one safe place to smoke is outside in a public place. Yes the smell isn't great, but that is where it will dissipate the quickest.

&gt; but it's at every doorway to every bar, restaurant or business

Bars and restaurants are to be expected to an extent. Their smoking areas are usually very poorly situated right next to the door though. And the ones that are a bit further away, are poorly enforced. Even as a smoker I don't agree with people smoking right outside the doors to bars and restaurants, it does seem rude. But if that's where the smoking shelter and cigarette bins have been placed, then what choice is there?

&gt; Maybe have designated smoking areas to contain the issue?

They already exist, but as I mentioned, they're usually poorly situated.

Cameron very carefully makes the case that he wants legislation to ban the means of preventing the police accessing the content of communications even in the face of a ""signed warrant from the home secretary"".

The only plausible means of achieving that is to make strong encryption illegal. 

By definition ""strong"" encryption has no known way of accessing the content that's easier than using the right key. Thus if you don't know the key, then there is no better way than guessing at the truly astronomic number of keys until you find the right one.

My guess is that he will end up proposing a key escrow system, where all legal cryptosystems have a key held by the government that can be used (after some sort of court authorisation) to decrypt the data. This is an awful idea for reasons that were explained at length 20 years ago when the US had the same idea, and eventually gave up on it.

Transcript from 1:20, my highlights - 

(After talking about access to communication metadata) 
&gt;""The second thing, which is more contentious, is about accessing the content of a telephone call or another form of communication. And here again, the same problem exists, will we be able to access the content of communications as the internet and new ways of communicating develop? Now, I have a very simple principle to apply here, which should be at the **heart of the legislation** that will be necessary, and the simple principle is this; in our country, do we want to allow a means of communication between people which **even in extremis, with a signed warrant from the home secretary, personally, that we cannot read?**""
&gt;Now up until now, governments of this country have said no. We must not have such a means of communication. That is why in extremis it has been possible to read someone’s letter. That is why in extremis it’s been possible to listen in on someone’s telephone call. That is why the same applies with mobile communications. Let me stress again, this cannot happen unless the home secretary personally signs a warrant. We have a better system for safeguarding this very intrusive power that probably any other country I can think of. **But the question remains, are we going to allow a means of communication where it simply isn’t possible to do that? And my answer to that question is no we must not.**""

Well this is the issue, we now have a view that it *can't* be between an underage person and someone who can't be said to be a peer. Especially when the older party has a position of power over them. 

I mean I've said this before when talking about it that I was in a band with a 20ish (I think, god it was a long time ago) singer who was adored by underage girls in the local scene. We'd make sure we never left him (or any of us actually) alone with them because we had no doubt that some of them would try it on. So they could initiate and they would say it was their idea and even be proud of it (as some people seem to think *that* matters) but there is really no way, at all, for us to know how that would turn out for them and by and large these days we think will mostly not turn out well over all. They could also be fine but that wasn't our call to make and in fact as the adult we had responsibility to look after them despite themselves.

You also always knew the guys who were not so open to the idea of  a duty of care of their younger fans or passed out drunk ones for that matter. Given that it's something that is vastly more unexceptable now than back in the day it wouldn't surprise me if a lot of people had a very good idea, if not solid proof, of  what Savile was up to if not the full extent of it.

Swansea were by far the better team, it was an illustration to me of how possession and dominance are not all that important sometimes. Saints had so many balls into the box and never looked like scoring. Swans had one shot in the first half and I would have picked them as the winners for most of the match.

Not much of the game had any level of tekkers, this was a one-off.

Gomis is good. Much like Ade at his best.

If you're in the market for a new car on finance look around - I have recently purchased a new car (Fiesta) and there are certainly some good deals around, SEAT had some great deals especially. 

Get a quote from drivethedeal.co.uk and use that to negotiate a good price in the dealership, I saved over 4000 from the list price of my car - just showing them the quote (not printing it out).

If you're going to buy a car on finance check out GAP insurance too (ala.co.uk) - I wouldn't take it from the dealership as it's usually overpriced.

I'm not a car salesman but having gone though this process recently I thought I'd share what I've learned.

&gt;

&gt;__Gaeltacht__ (/ˈɡeɪltəxt/; Irish pronunciation: [ˈɡeːl̪ˠt̪ˠəxt̪ˠ] or [ˈɡeːl̪ˠhəxt̪ˠ]; plural *Gaeltachtaí*) is the [Irish language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language) word meaning an Irish-speaking region.

&gt;In Ireland, __the Gaeltacht__, or *an Ghaeltacht*, refers individually to any, or collectively to all, of the districts where the government recognises that the [Irish language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language) is the predominant language, that is, the [vernacular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular) spoken at home.  These districts were first officially recognised during the early years of the [Irish Free State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Free_State), after the [Gaelic Revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Revival), as part of government policy to restore the Irish language.  It is now recognised that the Gaeltacht is threatened by serious language decline.

Seeing as you don't have a lump sum just yet... start by building an emergency fund for 3-6 months of expenses. Once you have that figured out, start looking at saving. Try and aim for maxing your ISA out each year (currently 15k), its one of the safest tax efficient investments you can make.

Look at bank accounts, there are a few which offer up to 3% interest a year (Santender), however you are a higher rate tax payer, so would only get 1.8% net. You can get around 1.5% in an ISA at the moment, so they aren't the best rates. If you think you will start approaching 15k+ in savings each year, you can keep your cash in a ordinary bank account and then switch to the ISA account near the end of the tax year, to make the most of your ISA allowance. 

If you are looking to save for retirement, remember you would get tax relief on any pension contributions, however you wouldn't be able to access them until you 55 years old. 

I'm in a similar situation to you OP, initially decided I'm jump on the house bandwagon, but decided I'd hold back and chuck my cash in equities (vanguard index funds) until I decide to settle down somewhere in 5 or so years.

You can't even blame Salah for this. Jose set out some ridiculous expectations for him that he just was not ready for. Its nearly the equivalent of buying a player like Andros Townsend, and then being disappointed they aren't on par with the likes of Hazard, Oscar, Willian, etc. The guy was literally still playing football in Africa a few seasons ago.

&gt;The one thing you can't tolerate is intolerance itself.

A famous paradox.  The claim is that if you tolerate intolerance, then you're leaving the door for intolerance to take over, because the intolerant certainly won't tolerate us.

But, there's another side to the paradox.  For if we refuse to tolerate, then it's *us* who become the intolerant, and intolerance will also take over, but because of *our* actions!

But, free speech is not necessarily tolerating the intolerant.  For free speech to work, yes we must have the tolerance to allow others to speak, no matter how much we disagree with them.  However, freedom of speech also gives us the unfettered freedom to attack any idea we see fit.  No matter how entrenched the majority opinion, we have the freedom in an open society to attack that opinion, with all our rhetorical might.  

To paraphrase Popper - in a free society, we kill bad ideas instead of killing each-other.  

Do you want to know more?  I recommend reading Jon Rauch's classic text on free-speech: 'Kindly Inquisitors', which explains the philosophical arguments defending freedom of speech.  You don't have to agree with Rauch, but it's a fascinating subject for anyone interested in philosophy.

1) Your brother accesses your Tesco online account and orders several games for various platforms.

2) He pays for this with his own card, gets them delivered in his name, and signs for the delivery.

3) Tesco sack you for ""not properly protecting"" your discount.

If this is the case, then the ""not properly protecting"" part comes from you allowing your brother to know your password for your Tesco account; if this is linked to your staff discount (and the fact he got a discount indicates that it is) then you actually haven't  protected it as he was able to use it without your knowledge or consent.

Family members ""can benefit from it"" but I am sure that this is only in your presence - no one else can use your discount card at a store, can they?

Have you told work that you didn't know your brother was using your account? This might also explain where the fraud threat has come from as he impersonated you by using your account - the delivery name and address are irrelevant, the account is yours.

As for the evidence and level of proof; this isn't a criminal case so they simply need to believe that you're guilty ""on the balance of probabilities"" and not ""beyond reasonable doubt"" because this is only a civil matter. 

If their policy states that only you can use the discount, only you should have access to it (be that through the physical card or through accounts tied to that card such as your Tesco online one), and you have admitted this negligence to them, then I am afraid that they're legally OK.

Please note, I am not making a comment on your actions or those of Tesco; I am just giving you the experience I have from working almost eight years in a field that relates to Emplyment Tribunals and Employer's Liability issues.

In my opinion, it does sound like Tesco wanted rid of you and are using this as an excuse but it could also be their policy as they might be worried from a loss- and fraud-prevention perspective so they operate a ""zero tolerance"" approach.",null,0,null,1422917218,null,0,false,0,co96qhu,null,t3_2ufn4f,null,t1_co96qhu,null,t3_2ufn4f,null,null,null,1424247969,null,1,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1,null

The recent Supreme Court ruling on Woodland v Essex County Council clearly states that schools have a ""non-delegable duty"" towards pupils in their care; a child drowned during a swimming lesson and the parents made a claim against the school. The council tried to argue that it was the swimming instructors who were liable as they were in control of the event but the judgment states that the school's duty of care cannot be delegated in such a fashion. How does the affect your case - coulld it be argued that Christmas meals are a ""school function"" and would that view change depending on if it were a boarding or day school?

As well as the contract wording, what does the insurance of pub say? Does it have an ""indemnity to principals"" clause? If so, the teachers can relax as the pub's insurance will indemnify them.

I was so impressed at how Shelvey dealt with what must have been a very frustrating first half. He made mistakes, but he seemed to let go of them much better than usual. Too often, he chases after his mistakes and seems to let his emotions get the better of him by showing frustration. Opponents see this and target him for it, winding him up, so it snowballs.

To repeat a comment that I posted on the AMA thread:

'Many are victims' is perhaps the most offensive part of this. Yes, many *people* are victims, but neither gender has a monopoly on victimhood.

Take a look at some data via [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/feb/13/violent-sexual-crime-statistics-england-wales-2013)

*""3.2% of males experienced violent crime in comparison to 1.9% of females.""*

*""As in recent years, two-thirds of homicide victims were male.""*

And being a victim of domestic violence certainly isn't exclusive to one gender

*""7.1% of women and 4.4% of men reported an experience of domestic abuse in the last year, which is roughly 1.2m females and 700,000 males.""*

You therefore might have two fights; one with the complex and one with your landlord but the way to fight both is the same: gather as much evidence of the state of the floor now and then take it again in a few months, see if you can find old photos showing the state of the floor, keep copies of the footage they've displayed and as much else as you can get (you can submit a data protection request for all footage of you and your flatmate can do the same) to see if you can show evidence of others dropping things or otherwise causing damage.

Keep all of this evidence and don't lose it! Find out what mechanism the complex intends to use to recover this debt and also complain about the withdrawel of implied services (gym use). Then put them to proof, in writing, asking them to fully substantiate their claims. 

I assume your deposit is regsitered with an appropriate protection scheme? Check here for details https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-deposit-protection/overview

from a primary school pov but probably applies across the board, you should know the basic system is broken (to quote the floyd, 'brick in the wall' is sadly fitting), actual learning and teaching opportunities are crowbarred between what is primarily just term by term panic to appease nonsensical government targets and just check the boxes. it takes a very strong person to maximise on those gaps and turn it into something meaningful.

your colleagues will probably be inspirations, your kids will be your strongest motivation, you really can't know if that's enough until you've been through the fire. it will break your heart to see children constantly being failed left, right and centre, first by their parents and then by the one system that should be able to give them some slim chance of thriving despite their parent's inadequacies. if you burn out after jumping through one unnecessary hoop too many like i did, expect to hate yourself, all parents and the gubbernment, in that order. good luck to you.

null,false,Public_Fire_Hazard,2,Ward,null,"Sanogo seems like he can do some damage to a defense without being aware of it, so I'm fine with him.

Murray seems to gel with Gayle as a late sub in my eyes (when Gayle is playing centrally anyway, hint hint Alan) so as long as we're not paying him a fortune I'm not too bothered. 

I hope Mutch doesn't play like he did against Everton again, because if he does I have a good mind to have a fit over how poor he is. If that sorts of game happens for him again it will be the biggest waste of money I've seen us make. 

Souare should hopefully be a good first team player, if he combines well with Bolasie we might have struck gold there.

Not seen anything from Breimyr or Anderson so I won't comment there.

Bannan for Chung Yong seems a good idea, the couple of Bolton games I've been to when he's played he looks sharp. It gives us another way of using the wings as opposed to either a) Tricks and pace from Wilf or Yala and b) Puncheon playing one-twos to get round the defenders. If the loan ends up going permanent I'm gonna miss Bannan, scoring the winner when we went down to 10 men against Hull the game before Pulis came in was one of my favourite moments of last season.

The problem with signing a ""quality"" centre half is that there wasn't really any going. We could have gone for Huth but that seems like a panic buy from Leicester since they're looking like a sinking ship at the minute, taking a 30 year old on loan is a very short term solution to the problem. If either centre back gets injured then we can stick Mariappa, Hangeland, Kelly or even Jedinak there to cover.

I'm not stuck in the past as you would like to think.

I'm an atheist, and have been since I was 11 years old - years before I had one clue about politics. I live with Protestant unionists, I'm even friends with a UKIP'er or two.

10 years at west ham 

That goal at Wembley to take us up 

Stayed with us and took a wage cut when we got relegated .

In 2009 season Cole is a beast and a lot of clubs wanted him like Liverpool,arsenal  and villa , Liverpool almost signed him in 09 . and he always stayed at west ham 

He  tweets how much he loves the club even if some of the fans hates him 

He never ever moans no matter how much shit he gets or the lack of playing time he gets unlike people like zarate 

He has gotten along with every manager he worked for in our club

I'm very reluctant to trash any plans that are in progress just for the sake of it.

* Labour - terrible track record going back to the 1970s (particularly on the economy) and Miliband is just a complete buffoon with obvious waning support from his own ranks.  ""Crash Gordon"" way back in 1997 sowed the seeds of the mess we are now in - remember Ken Clarke (Major's Chancellor) left behind the best economic statistics the country has ever seen

* UKIP - pointless wasted vote.  Everyone thinks they're marvellous because of Farage's novelty comedy act stance on immigration, but most of his other policies are arse

* Lib Dem - HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  I fully expect Clegg to lose his seat and quit as leader

* SNP - cannot and should not be trusted, but they have hoovered up a lot of the erstwhile Scottish Labour voter base

* Greens - hipster party and protest vote with some absolutely reprehensible policies that nobody cares to even read

The Conservatives and Labour are the only two parties with the faintest chance of a majority win, and Miliband probably isn't up to it.

It doesn't even matter if what you're hiding is illegal or not. Simply refusing to speak and give up the keys can land you in prison.

What Cameron wants is a way to get your key **without your knowledge** and access encrypted data on the fly without you knowing that it is happening or about to happen. It would be just like tapping your phone. This is easy for your phone, because everything that goes through your phone is controlled by the phone company and all it takes is a warrant and the phone company will comply with whatever the police want. The call itself isn't even encrypted so anyone can listen in with the right tools.

But how would they do this for the Internet? Unlike your phone, there is no single or small number of pathways or companies that you must use to communicate. You don't have to use snapchat or Skype or WhatsApp or Gmail to communicate. Any person can create their own encrypted communication channel on the Internet that can be unlocked by only himself and the receiver. Microsoft can't decrypt it. The ISP can't decrypt it. Even the person who wrote the encryption software can't decrypt it. No one can be forced to allow access except the person with the key, and you can't get it off him without him knowing about it.

So then what can you do? If our goal is to not allow any means of communication that cannot be accessed by the government, then this can't be allowed.

Your failing to cite these 'flegger comments' of mine or what makes me the 'flegger' I am.

 I know I am viewed as republican/SF supporting/nationalist in this sub, but that is a legitimate political viewpoint and *not* primitive/looking back. SF are one of the leading progressive parties here. I'd like to take this opportunity to also say I support People Before Profit over SF too, and class myself Socialist before Republican. I gave my first vote to SF in the last local elections, my second vote was to the Alliance Party (a non sectarian non nationalist/unionist party). I would've voted for PBP and Alliance but PBP didn't stand anybody in my constituency.

Also, regarding your username; the 12th July is widely seen as a supremacist holiday by all right minded people *the world over*. Yet you feel you can call me a flegger. I don't light bonfires with homophobic, racist and xenophobic remarks on them, I don't support, condone, or glorify it's existence with usernames. My own username is a play on words of sort. Éire [pronounced as heir] of the North - as in the North of Westeros in Game of Thrones, which is filmed here, the North of Ireland.

null,false,MarioMagnifico,null,null,null,"I think you are massively exaggerating his form at the moment. He has played well, and was excellent against Chelsea but he has still looked poor with his distribution and, despite being more consistent coming out, he has made one or two errors in the past few games when trying to collect the ball. It might sound picky but when you consider that, aside from the Chelsea game where he made two very good stops, he hasn't been called upon to make too many good saves recently then it seems not making mistakes is the least we should expect, no? You're massively over rating his performance level, possibly because you're accustomed to his poor form. 

If he was playing like this at Sunderland, even if we pretend for a second that he has been exceptional recently (instead of just good, or relatively great to his own form), then who else do you expect to come in for him? Spurs, United, City and Chelsea all have brilliant goalkeepers who are far better than Migs even in his current form and Wenger is a stubborn one, as we know. They made the right decision too. Mingolet is not a top four goalkeeper. He's a good midtable keeper who has better than average shot stopping but falls short in other areas of his game. 

Please tell me your argument isn't derived from his cleansheets? This is clearly in large part due to our defense, fixtures, overall better play, as well as migs. That argument sounds like something an American might say thinking football is akin to ice hockey in that goalkeepers are far more responsible for their goals conceded. You're just bang wrong mate. He was fantastic at periods for Sunderland, good enough to get us to sign him and then wonder what we were thinking only 4 months on. Your form has to be consistently great to earn a transfer from a club like Sunderland up to Liverpool if you plan on commanding the number one spot. His form was just that, but obviously he doesn't have a style that fits us and he hasn't had the mental fortitude to deal with the increased expectations. Sure, he's had an upturn in form and I am so thankful for this, but you're painting him as if he's one of the league's top goalkeepers..

...In all seriousness: We are typically a mid-table club. But this has been anything but the typical season. In fact, it was the best position we'd had through Christmas in 30 years. When you have that good of a start, you need to maintain ambition or risk losing out to complacency as the year wears on.

In a typical year I'd agree with you. But this has not been a typical year. Instead of doubling down on our efforts and bringing in reinforcements, we've stood pat and now have to navigate a continuing very rough patch of games while also dangerously thin of bodies (particularly at CB).

I was gutted when my old driver retired, he was such a sweetheart. The new one is nice too but I don't quite know him well enough yet :( 

I enjoy it when they turn up in their [pretty van's carrying a wicker basket full of different types of tea, biscuits, chutney, jam, etc, etc.](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ringtons+tea&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9R3QVLq9Nce4Ueu7hPAI&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=320&amp;bih=444) and they've been around for a long time!

The original deliveries were via horse and cart! (as shown in the search above.)  I pay £3.24 for 100 tea bags which equals 200 beautiful cups of tea. I'm never going back to buying from the supermarket.

I can order online from a huge selection or just take my ""usual"" when they arrive on my doorstep (plus anything else in the basket that looks good, I often end up with a pack of their ginger snaps) and I can either pay online or pay by cash or card at the door.

If you don't have any cash or your card on hand then they just smile and tell you not to worry, you can pay it next time. It's nice to be trusted, I can't think of any modern companies that have customer service that rivals my Rington's driver!

I sound like an advert for them but I'm disabled and housebound so having a familiar person knock on my door to bring me tea and biscuits along with a friendly chat and a genuine smile is pure heaven. I'm pathetic, I know.

&gt;The Doctor is sitting in a tea room, enjoying an afternoon tea with scones, cream and jam. He glances at the table next to him and pauses when he spotted a mysterious hooded figure at the end of the table facing him. He turns to face forward again, but suddenly the figure is sitting at his table.
&gt;The hooded figure, whose face cannot be seen, says that a woman wants to meet him. The Doctor tries to brush it off, saying that's nice, but he is married, and doesn't discuss his work in public. The hooded figure said that he knows that and waved his hand; suddenly, the cafe is empty.
&gt;The Doctor, intrigued now, asks the hooded figure who it is, but the figure merely replies it is a messenger for a woman named Darla Von Karlsen. The Doctor says he never heard of her and, standing to leave, finds himself in a dark room. The Doctor now realises that this message is a form of psychic projection and he is dreaming. The figure asks him if he knows where the room is, but the Doctor ignores him and tries to figure out how to break the message. He tries to wake himself up and comes to in a chair on a beach, but almost immediately the figure tells him he is still dreaming.

I hope you don't mind a bit of constructive criticism here. This is just my opinion so feel free to disregard or disagree if you feel like doing so. I know some of the posts are just match reports, but this is claiming to be an analysis so let's try get to the nitty gritty. If the writer is going to analyse ""just how City are missing Yaya Toure and Wilfried Bony"" then you've really got to dig into the footballing reasons behind the way the team plays without them. The parts about Toure's moments of magic and leadership are definitely valid, but you've got the chance to give some deeper insight here. Let's use the latest Chelsea game as an example.


In Yaya's absence Fernandinho and particularly Fernando offer far less of a goal threat and from midfield. Milner was his industrious self and pressed Ivanovic into a few key mistakes, but didn't offer as much creatively either. This left David Silva as the sole creator in central midfield, who Mourinho had Ramires man-mark in an attempt to close down the space for him to operate in. This allowed Matic to sit in his preferred position in front of the back four and stay closer to Aguero. There were a few instances where Chelsea's defence were vulnerable on the counter, particularly Aguero's missed chance, but they were quick to get men behind the ball and sit that Chelsea Bus right in front of goal. 


Naturally City moved the ball wide to find space and Navas did a superb job of showing up Azpilicueta on several occasions. Unfortunately his crosses met a stacked Chelsea box and a 1.73m Aguero was always going to struggle physically against the likes of Zouma, Terry and Matic. Pellegrini reacted by bringing on Jovetic to inject energy and take creative pressure off Silva, Dzeko to provide a more significant target in the Chelsea box, and Milner was moved centrally. Maybe it was just late in the game but I felt this was where the game began to open up a bit more. Mourinho obviously felt the pressure and brought on Gary Cahill as he decided to hold out for a draw.


As the writer quite rightly pointed out, Dzeko and Jovetic have been a little lacklustre on the goal front, and this seems to be the perfect time to point out how Bony's physical presence and aerial ability could become key for City to break down defences such as these. We've all seen the goals he's been scoring for Ivory Coast, and it's worth mentioning his play style is more direct than Dzeko, with an occasional dose of flair to boot. Instead, the analysis fizzles out and the writer simply says. 
&gt; I’m sure Bony will thrive in a City shirt and make a huge difference to the team when he eventually does play.

At the risk of sounding like an English teacher, I'm sure you can find a hard hitting conclusion in there somewhere rather than just a throwaway statement like that ;)

Also, if I was to be really nitpicky there are also a few chances to simplify what's being said. Some of the statements are quite a mouthful if you read them out loud...

&gt; Furthermore when positioned usually aside Fernando or Fernandinho in the centre of midfield he must give one of the Brazilian pair, whoever is picked by Pellegrini,  a big confidence boost.

That being said I think you've got a good looking site and the enthusiasm with the posting is great. Hopefully if you guys keep working on the content quality you can cultivate a really good following.

ARE YOU FOR SERIOUS RIGHT NOW???  That is the utterly the most ridiculous thing I've ever read.   You should be ashamed for garbage like that.  Aside from the fact that **HE HAD ALREADY IMMIGRATED TO ENGLAND BEFORE WEST BROM FOUND HIM!!**   West Brom didn't do shit for him.  This wasn't some charity signing.  He was tearing up playgrounds before they found him....Saido did it all by himself by being an amazing footballer.  West Brom were lucky to have been the ones that were fortunate to sign him first.   Saido Berahino owes absolutely nothing to West Brom outside the contractual obligations he legally agreed to, a contract he has more than provided value for.   

&gt;Don't believe me, go look at his performances between August - October and November - January, he's overrated. And expensive. No thanks.

Your insane.  Saido has proven all season how talented he is.  We've saw his skill last weekend for fucks sake.  Trying to downplay his performances and talent that he's displayed all season is beyond ludicrous.  Every player goes through periods of statistical droughts.  He's still shown touch and class every game.   

&gt;Scores a hattrick in the FA cup, doesn't even recongize the shirt or the fans. 

OMFG!!!!  All he did was not celebrate a couple of goals.  Why's that such a big deal for you?  I mean for fucks sake, it's not like he actually said anything, you're just pretending to be a psychologist.  

You wanna know how he's respecting the fans??? He scored a fucking hattrick.   That's the best way to respect club and fans.

The issue is compounded by many folks with super-common names - William, John, James.  The upside, though, is from arrival in the country lots of lines intermarried, so you can sometimes find records of one line with the others.  (The drawback to that is that it's pretty tough to use DNA testing to sort it out.)  Have been trying to figure out if some of these families were allied before arrival or no.

I did have a few straight from Scotland, however - one that's easy to find records on Stateside is Ninian Beall, my 10th or so great grandfather, from Largo, Fife.  More on Ninian:  http://lundinlinks.weebly.com/blog/ninian-beall
