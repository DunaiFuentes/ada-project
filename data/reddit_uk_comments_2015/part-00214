Most economists accept the version of macro[ outlined here.](http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/mediamacro-myths-summing-up.html).

Politically this line suits the progressives so most progressives also support this line with some notable exceptions - the Labour Party doesn't for instance.

People who accept this view believe in spending out of recession or at least not cutting when in recession.

The main alternative position is neo-liberalism the Austrian School of economics which was utterly dominant until 2008. This incorporates Thatcherism and Reaganism and has a great many politicians who support it. It is also buttressed by simple to understand (but wrong) economic analogies like ""I don't buy a pint at the end of the week if I've spent all my pay.""

People who support this position are pro-austerity and include our government as well as the IMF and major EU insitutions.

There are some plus points for austerity for certain sections of society. It's very good for keeping workers and poor people in line, it's very good for rich people, it's very good for people who to move capital out of the country.

And of course there's a lot of genuine, good-hearted people who support reducing public spending out of a belief that it is similar to running a household and clearing debts is a great way to move forward. Not everyone's a cynic, but I think most non-cynics who are pro-austerity have been rather fooled by economically illiterate tub-thumping.",null,0,null,1433557158,null,0,false,0,crx5rje,null,t3_38ph2t,null,t1_crx5rje,null,t1_crx50zf,null,null,null,1436768286,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

A transfer payment is not productive, and is usually economically inefficient (although not always). Taking from one person and giving it to another, for no services, is unlikely to have an aggregate affect on production. Taking out debt to give people money is similar, although the mechanism is more complex (government debt distorts the money markets and stifles investment).

However, an injection into the economy is productive. This is what pretty much all economists advocate in some form at the moment. The government can take out debt at very favourable rates and invest in productive projects. House building has been proposed by many, as it kills two birds with one stone. Transport is a common example, although in the UK case it may not be as useful, with the possible exception of aviation/airports. Some economists propose ""great works"" projects, like say building a massive hydroelectric dam, but this has broadly fallen out of favour as it is usually subject to spectacular waste and corruption. Employing public workers is also productive, but may only be possible during the good times and lead to labour market distortions in the bad times.

The Tories are doing the opposite because they do not want to be seen to be making inefficient transfer payments.

null,false,johnmedgla,null,null,null,"&gt;One of the most influential [myths] is that there are ""three generations of families where no one has ever worked"". This is an idea first championed by welfare secretary Iain Duncan Smith back in 2009 when he was at the Centre for Social Justice and commenting on housing poverty said: ""Life expectancy on some estates, where often three generations of the same family have never worked, is lower than the Gaza Strip"". It suggests that unemployment can be explained by ""cultures of worklessness"" and ""welfare dependency"" being passed down the generations, from grandparent to parent to child. A debate in the House of Commons at the end of November saw government and opposition MPs drawing on exactly these ideas. But a new study for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which set out to see whether cultures of worklessness helped explain long-term unemployment in families across generations, dispels any notion that this is the case.

&gt;Together with Andy Furlong at Glasgow University and researchers Johann Roden and Robert Crow, we undertook fieldwork in very deprived neighbourhoods of Glasgow and Middlesbrough. We used every method available to try to locate families with three generations that had never worked, such as spending days surveying clients of job centres, interviewing dozens of organisations that worked in these neighbourhoods, advertising via posters, newsletters and newspaper stories through leafleting and door-knocking and spending months in these neighbourhoods talking to hundreds of residents.

&gt;Despite this, we were unable to find any such families. If they exist, they can only account for a minuscule fraction of workless people. Recent surveys suggest that less than 1% of workless households might have two generations who have never worked. Families with three such generations will therefore be even fewer.

null,false,sad_violin,lfc12,,null,"In transitions he acts as a CAM, almost in a Coutinho-esque way. He takes possession of the ball in his own half while the other team is still out of position and leads charges or plays incisive passes to his teammates. Once the team has transitioned (assuming a goal hasn't been scored), he is more useful as a CM using his distribution ability to fan the ball out to players on the wing/play Icardi through balls. On defense, he operates fairly high up, but he is pretty good about following through on opposition midfielders' runs and picking them up, so at times he practically plays as a DM. 

To answer your question, Kovacic will play behind all of the midfielders you mentioned, but in transitions, he will probably bear the same responsibilities they will on attack. His pace and dribbling abilities mean that he can act as a conveyor belt out of defense into the counter, and his passing abilities mean that he can find someone else to bring the ball up the field if he is marked. 

If we get Kovacic, then this team will be deadly on the counter. Origi and Studge up top with Marko/Lallana/(maybe) Sterling/Coutinho in behind getting played incisive passes after making runs instead of before (imho that's part of what made this season so frustrating). 

Remember all of those times that Sterling got the ball too early in the transition while he was marked and our counter was stifled? That can't happen when 3 or 4 other players in the team are equally threatening on the break. Having real strikers and midfielders who aren't 35 (sorry Stevie I love you but you got so slow...) means it's possible for this team to strike fear into the hearts of other teams (as well as get shitloads of goals). If Sterling is double covered, then Kova and Coutinho have space, etc etc. The team was so predictable this season because only a few people were useful on the counter. 

Can can also help in this role, but I see him sitting behind and arriving to play after the transition has happened. Or perhaps he could operate as a double/triple pivot with Kova and Hendo. 

Anyway, assuming we pick up the right players, this team has a quick enough spine to become a real threat on the counter, and a lot of the prospects we've seen touted in the media seem to indicate that LFC will become deadly on the counter once again.

At the end of the ride you and your driver get to rate each other. So if your have a bad driver or the passenger is a very rude they will get blacklisted. Also if your driver acts weird/inappropriate you can report them. Rating and comments are made public to other passengers.

They moved him down to the CM position, as a part of 3 man midfield and it was working wonders for the guy. As Sad_violin said, put him in a CM position behind Coutinho, Lallana and a striker and magic can happen. He got everything you need in a creative player. He got the shots, he can work hard etc. But he is not a holding player, so if we are going to play Henderson, Milner and Kovacic we are going to struggle against teams like Chelsea and Arsenal, as they will find our weakness and we could end up giving away more goals than we should. However, as Henderson and Milner are known for their workrate, it can be used in a way to reduce the threat against stronger teams like that. 


Still would like another DM anyways, but with the addition of Kovacic, Allen's days in the Liverpool shirt could come to an end. As we are going to have: Emre Can, Milner, Allen, Kovacic, Henderson, Lucas and you could even put Coutinho in that midfield 3. So that is 7 for 3 position and for the DM position i would only really use Lucas there, as the other guys have been shown to be ineffective in that position.

I can see why Rodgers wants him, we don't really have anyone who can play make from as deep as kovacic can.  

Inter changed to a system similar to what I see us utilizing with Kovacic Medel and Guarin in the middle and Hernanes right in front of him with two strikers.

But on the note of the things there isn't. What exactly do you mean by thumbnails, as this could be a couple of things? And No flairs? Ehh.....not counting the series 8 ones, there's 11 flairs for content up there but as I've mentioned elsewhere, we're waiting on something else before working on these properly.

Isco would be fantastic though. The rumors got me a bit excited even though I don't see Madrid letting him go. They've got so many central midfielders though and it seems like they might go for more in Verratti or Pogba and they prefer James over Isco even though I think Isco is better.

If we could have Isco in the middle and Hazard and Willian on the wings with the rest of our team staying the same I think we'd have a great shot at winning the CL. 

Other than that just the usual like Pogba, Griezmann, Lacazette, Verratti, Bale, Reus. 

Maybe Götze if he's on the outs at Bayern, I know you get crucified for saying it on this sub, but goddamn what a player De Bruyne has shown himself to be, would like it if we could make it work with him.

Maybe Ricardo Rodriguez or Gaya if we moved Azpi back on the right where he can actually attack.

Young players. Tielemans obviously looks like a guy destined for greatness and he already knows Musonda so it'd be cool if we could have those 2 playing alongside Hazard. A bit of a random and unlikely thing to throw out there, but I like this Korean kid at Barca, Lee Seung-Woo, and he looks to be the next big thing in Asia.

It really might be worth considering *why* it is you have low activity ratings. At this current time, /r/civ has thrice the active users and half the subscribers of /r/doctorwho. I think it's very important to realise why this is the case. 

Have you considered the reason of the success of /r/gallifrey is essentially because there was a max exodus of people who once subscribe to /r/doctorwho found the quality here lacking? The two subreddits shouldn't work dichotomously, wherein all discussion is forced over to one subreddit. There are many high-quality examples of in-depth discussion and flagship subreddits working together in harmony. I don't consider the comparison with /r/civ apples and oranges, rather I think it's important to consider the hypothetical alternate history of the sub. If the post-quality diminished over time and the moderators didn't feel compelled to rectify this, you can sure as hell guarantee a second subreddit dedicated to in-depth discussion would gain a lot more traction than the current /r/CivStrategy currently does.

And you're right, people should not expect miracles from the moderators - but they should feel a certain amount of effort is being put into the subreddit. 

In regards to thumbnails - I'm talking about the pictures next to the the topic titles. In regards to flairs - I'm talking about distinct categories that posts fall under (Discussion, Art, Image etc.) as can be seen on /r/gameofthrones or /r/CitiesSkylines 

There really needs to be a change here. The subreddit design is lacking, and the lack of moderator participation from and observer's standpoint seems absolutely minimal. There's not even a link to /r/gallifrey directly on the sidebar, instead you have to go via a wiki, which I doubt many peop

Anything that can't be tracked just ends up in the bin eventually, there's nothing else that can be done. We wouldn't have had close to the volume RM gets, they probably care less than we did. Their machines destroy mail often, things end up opened by accident and on purpose if an address isn't properly visible yet we know it's there. Only certain people are meant to do that though, as opening mail that isn't yours is a very, very, big no no.  

We handled legal documents (probably far more than RM) that contained everything you could imagine, you simply don't care. Just like tellers and checkout assistants don't care either. Everyone sorting the daily crap are more than likely to have little clue about falling into bad hands and all that.

Honestly, sorting is so robotic and monotonous , the moment they see no address it'll go straight into a tub / slot / sack / crate without a second glance. If there's a footer address or something, it be might posted back in a special envelope apologising about damage or something or another.

Those rates are currently at a historic low - meaning that the Government can borrow money _very_ cheaply.

Now imagine if you could borrow money with a negligible interest rate - it's pretty much free money at that point! Free money which you can then invest in things like education, infrastructure and so on and begin getting the return faster and thus make more money.

So long as the average return on investment of your spending is higher than the interest rates that you borrowed at then it makes economic sense as you can pay the debt back __and__ cover the interest __and__ have made some more money!

Given that areas such as education, healthcare and infrastructure are known to have high rates of return (thus why they are targeted by the Washington Consensus for investment in developing economies) then it makes perfect sense for the Government to borrow money now to spend on those things.

&gt;Distribution of wealth is necessary for a balanced and equal society

.... no. Who taught you that? Coercive distribution of wealth is inherently unjust because wealth is earned. Unless you can prove *theft*, all that wealth came to those that posses it through voluntary exchanges with other free agents. What is the justification for taking from them what is theirs?

The correct purpose of taxation is to pay for those actual *services* that only a large authoritative body can offer... large infrastructure works such as roads a damns, national defense and the police and court systems. The taxation is payment for something the taxpayer themselves actually uses.

There is no need or justification for social programs that provide aid to individuals. such programs take from one body and give to another... it's is not an exchange of value for value, it is a siphon.

&gt;without correct taxation (corporate and personal) you end up with a country financially and socially divided.

I don't even know what this means. You are treating taxation as a tool for manipulation rather than as a simple means of funding necessary projects. Building a highway requires wealth generally out of the reach of any private entity and serves ALL equally. So it is an appropriate job of government. Subsidizing this person's house or that person's health care is neither equally beneficial nor is it necessary to the lives of the general public.

As a rule of thumb, if a government program uses personalized account information to track the benefits of individual citizens, it is an improper use of government. Government services should be generically accessible to ALL on an equal basis, such as leaving your garage and turning onto a street or using water from a reservoir.",null,0,null,1433577873,null,0,false,0,crxd298,null,t3_38jv5k,null,t1_crxd298,null,t1_crwiwiw,null,null,null,1436772219,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,mr-strange,null,null,null,"Firstly, £235k is an opening offer, not the price you will need to pay. Have you researched what you think the flat is actually worth? Bear in mind that there will be a ground rent and service charge - you need to find out how much that is. Also, how many years are left on the lease?

(I've been valuing leasehold flats quite a bit recently. PM me if you want a bit more detailed help.)

Once you've agreed on a reasonable price, then bear in mind that the landlord *really* wants to sell to you. Selling direct will save him at least 1% estate agent fees - maybe up to 2.5%. He will probably want to evict you so that he can sell the flat with vacant possession. That's going to cost him perhaps 6 months rent - maybe another 3% of the purchase price. So selling to you will save him around 5% of the purchase price, as well as being quick and convenient. You should pocket that 5%, and let him keep the ""quick and convenient"" benefits.

So if a fair price for the flat is £200k, you should ask for an additional 5% discount, taking the price to you down to £190k.

That £10k is called a ""landlord gifted deposit"". There are specialist mortgage providers who will count it towards your deposit. That may enable you to borrow more than you otherwise could - although you will probably pay a higher interest rate :-/. I recently sold a house to my tenants, and they decided *not* to use the landlord discount as a deposit - they found that they could get a better deal with a normal mortgage. Either way, you should insist on the discount.

Finally, it sounds like this purchase is a little beyond your range. I suggest that you go back to your flat mate, and try to persuade them to pitch in. If the landlord can't sell to you, then he *will* evict you both before trying to sell it to someone else.",null,0,null,1433579718,null,0,false,0,crxdhdb,null,t3_38ou5x,null,t1_crxdhdb,null,t3_38ou5x,null,null,null,1436772416,null,7,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,7,null

null,false,TBHNA-Joyful,null,null,null,"&gt; Everyone on here always talks about how Housing Benefit is a landlord subsidy and increasing it becomes the new minimum level of rent in an area.

Generally it depends where your properties are how much initial investment those properties needed, but yes, in the general case housing benefit is an excellent boon to landlords (and those entitled to HB). For the most part it provides a guarantee that if you buy sensibly, you'll never have to fear that rental income won't cover both interest *and repayment* on a mortgage while rates are relatively low. Either keep the places with outstanding debt on interest-only terms and buy a more, just bank the extra each month (fill pension to limit etc.) or pay off the debt with (for the most part) tax payers money.

Housing benefit is great for ~~everyone~~ lots of us. It keeps the poor in a home they otherwise cannot afford and would need to move from, gives landlords a (in practical terms) nullification on the risk of rental income falling below the debt servicing costs (put another way: a tax-payer guaranteed minimum income).

The only people shafted are people not entitled to subsidy. E.g. renters who earn too much for it - forced to pay more for lower quality housing stock or - and first-time-buyers who are otherwise priced out of the market by those of us getting an indirect subsidy and buying additional places (thus keeping the sale prices high).

&gt; and not increase people becoming homeless?

No idea really. It depends if there are places for people priced out to move to.

There will only be about 100 people in your year at college and probably 6 or so on your course at that year so you'll get to know them all really quickly.  Colleges also organise their own sports teams, choirs, parties etc so it's pretty easy to find something to do.  Most will also have a separate orientation for internationals before term starts so they can get to know other people and New has quite a visible American presence so I imagine they've got it all organised by now!

If making friends in college doesn't work then there's always the people from your faculty or you could join a uni wide team or society. (There's literally hundreds and there's a fair at the start of term where they all have stands)

One tip though, the terms in Oxford move pretty fast (they're only 8 weeks long!) so you have to get up and go straight away.  The people who had trouble making friends tended to be the ones who spent the first few weeks milling around not sure what to do and by the time they'd decided what they wanted to do it was pretty much the end of the first term.  I'd say it's better to get involved in stuff straightaway and drop it later than to wait around trying to decide what's right.

In fairness, Hyypia was also hamstrung by poor work at board level - failure to replace key players, stats-based signings that only proved you can't rely on stats - and also injuries to important midfielders. 

The board actually weren't going to sack him (he had to resign) because they thought the statistics reflected that the team was performing well and were ""unlucky"" not to get the results their performances deserved. In reality, they just looked nice on the ball but had very little cutting edge, and were often reliant on individual moments of quality (they'd have been fucked without Teixeira).

Sound a little similar to Rodgers? Well, the crucial difference is that Rodgers knows how to set up an attack when he's got the right striker (and even when he doesn't, and he has to use a winger).

Its rare for organisations (esp. those without many million of pounds of card throughput a week) to deal directly with visa/mastercard etc. The IT to handle it alone is costly, and I can't imagine a Mastercard sales rep would even bother returning your call for less than $20,000/week.

Also the landlord is going through the agency. He hasn't been a great landlord in general so to be honest I prefer it this way, though I wouldn't brush off a direct offer.

My flatmate is here on a visa so doesn't want to get involved with the property ladder yet. My boyfriend on the other hand wants a joint mortgage, but I'm not sure I like the flat *that* much to consider a joint mortgage just yet. There are two or three new build flats in the area though so I'll be looking into those while I still feel in the game (will need to find a new place to rent anyway!).

Questions:

1. Does vacant possession increase the price of the flat?

2. Am I right in saying fewer years on a lease will lower the value of the flat because the buyer would need to extend it? In that case if I'm trying to save money, would it be better for me to buy something with fewer years and extend it myself?

3. What's your take on market price trends at the moment? I'm constantly told that house prices are going to go way up again and that now's the best time to buy a property to capitalise on that.

&gt; This deal isn't an indication of telling him to leave, it's telling him we want to strengthen our team and you better step up and fight


I agree with your point about giving players something to play for but Skertel has been our best defender for the last 2 years , he was the top scoring defender in PL. He has been our most consistent defender this season. There will be others who have come with massive transfer fees and wages  like Loveren , even Sakho would have good wages and they are not even consistently picked in the team. So you are telling the most consistently picked defender for last 2 years ( who  has also served the club the longest ) to earn his  worth while there are others who are enjoying similar wages while sitting on the bench.  What signal does that send out ? What is a coutinho thinking looking at this situation ? 

Its like what the phone companies do with its existing customers . All the fancy deals are for the new ones and the existing ones get a bag of crisps.

Bottomline , if you  think he isnt good enough , sell  him find a  new  defender  if not reward him appropriately  for his loyalty to the club and the performance of last 2 season

A bit of extra time and a note to the examiners saying you hadn't been given the formula booklet would probably have had a good outcome. Examiners are usually good at taking individual considerations such as muck ups like this/illness during exams into account sensibly. Admittedly there's no way of them picking a fair amount of extra time at that stage in the exam, but half an hour is pretty decent - if 25% needed it in a four hour exam and you got two hours in before you got the booklet, that's about right as a back of the envelope calculation for time-spent-on-booklet-needing-questions-before-getting-booklet, and the note to examiners would hopefully take account of the extra stress and confidence knock (remember, ""back of the envelope"" is the best they can do, they can't tell exactly how much time you have/would have spent on what...).

As it is, they'll have a decent arguement that you should have noticed immediately that you were missing the booklet and asked for one (which ought to mean getting one reasonably quickly, and either spending the time until you do doing bits where you don't need it or with the clock paused waiting).

Please enlighten me as to where I said either of these things in my post. I said that he hadn't played in a system like ours (he's always been the target man, and it takes time to adapt to new systems) and he's never played under a manager like Rodgers (someone who is very insistent on constant pressing). Please don't put words into my mouth. 

As for the rest of your comment, it seems that you're actually just confirming what I've said -- that our system doesn't fit with his style. He even said himself that he prefers the two striker system to work in. 

&gt; [Sturridge] knows when and where to press. 

This is just a bollocks statement unless you've been watching streams of games purely focusing on Sturridge's pressing. This season, in the small amount of games he has played in, there has been almost no effort on his part and his pressing has been virtually non-existent. I get that he's coming back from injury, but how can people be so hypocritical as to single out one player for not working hard but fail to mention another one?

null,false,TheConnivingPedant,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt; Housing benefit is great for everyone lots of us. It keeps the poor in a home they otherwise cannot afford and would need to move from, gives landlords a (in practical terms) nullification on the risk of rental income falling below the debt servicing costs (put another way: a tax-payer guaranteed minimum income).

Hooray for tax-payer guaranteed minimum income for landlords! A £16 billion pound a year subsidy for an asset that has averaged a **16%** yearly return over the past two decades. In financial terms this is fucking madness. The British (or at least southern English) rental market is the biggest gravy-train in the world and the idea that landlords need it in case they lose money (oh no, investors might lose money, the horror!) is ridiculous. Paying out housing benefit *does* raise the rent for everyone else, which raises the housing benefit bill.

So, what's the alternative? Obviously you don't want simply take away housing benefit and lower prices via mass homelessness. Distorted markets and subsidies for the well off are bad, but homelessness is worse. Far worse. Housing benefit started because of the sell-off of council housing created a shortage. The only way to reverse it is to build council housing again. For the £16 billion per year going into landlords' pockets you could build some 100,000 new units *every single year*. It would solve the housing crisis, lower the rents for everyone and be far cheaper in the long because you're not giving massive payouts to landlords year after year.",null,0,null,1433587070,null,0,false,0,crxezuf,null,t3_38py6y,null,t1_crxezuf,null,t1_crxdmp9,null,null,null,1436773185,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

I don't really care about Balo's pressing. As I said, he has shown a lack of basic striker instincts. Being in the right place, looking for space, having good off-the-ball movements, meeting crosses and finishing the chances. Did none of them.

For Albert to know that Bernard will not know which month her birthday is from the day, it must be a month that has days that appear in every other month (so that it the day cannot uniquely identify it).

So May is out as if Bernard was told 17th, then he would know May is the answer.

June is also out as the 18th also uniqely idenifies it.

July is safe.

August is also safe.

The remaining days are 14th, 15th, 16th and 17th in July and August.

The 14th would not allow Bernard to know which month as it appears in both.

The 15th, 16th and 17th appear in the other months and would allow Bernard to know which date it was.

However, for Albert to then know which date it was from the fact that Bernard knows... Damn I think I'm stuck.

Part of me wants to say July 16th so I'm going for it. I will edit when I find the answer.

Edit: ahahahaha holy shit, turns out that was actually right. I think I was supposed to say that because there were two dates in August and only one in July? So Albert could only know for certain if it was July (only one date). I suppose that's kind of what I was going for but not 100%.

This article is just another anti-Labour mouthpiece trying to paint everyone to the left of Tony Blair as some red under the bed socialist. The Labour party needs to examine itself properly and it can't do that with a bunch of ideologically similar people running for the leadership - Burnham, Cooper and Kendall all agree with each other on all the major points. They all agree that we need austerity, none of them is willing to stand up for the poorest in society (we're not a party of benefits, we're a party of workers), each of them has signed up to the Tory rhetoric of scroungers vs skivers.

Corbyn is the only leadership candidate who has differing views, and he's been put up by the left element of the party to try and drive debate around these points. My own personal viewpoint colours my judgement, were I still a Labour member I would probably be considered as an element of the hard left, but I think it's important the party at least considers these elements of it's policies.

New Labour worked once. It won't work twice - you won't take the Tories core vote from them again. In the meantime the party is hemorrhaging votes to the Greens on social policies and UKIP on immigration and it's doing very little to try and recapture those votes.

To that I say; They are not obligated to report everything that comes out of Parliament's press office as fact but that is exactly what Nick Robinson (And whoever does it now...) did for years. They took those pieces of paper, walked across the green and stood infront of a camera parroting exactly what was written without any journalistic insight. Literally none. They don't even hide that this is how they operate. People believe what is said on BBC News and frankly that is below the standards one would expect from a trainee journalist, let alone a BBC political correspondent. That's not news, that's Public Relations. 

&gt;The BBC is one of the few organisations that bothers to run any length of conflicting quotes from opposing sources when they cover something, be it a government or opposition story they are reporting.

The BBC generally, yes, BBC News, no. There is a clear difference on what and how they report. BBC News frequently runs 5 - 10 minute pro-government policy segments with an obligatory ""Critics say this is bad"" at the end of the advert. They frequently and uncritically repeat whatever the government's reply is on a specific topic without ever going ""Well, that's a load of bollocks, and here's why:""

You are correct that the numbers should at least be corrected for the number of people that are consuming hard drugs / drugs that can lead to death (so exclude e.g. cannabis users and people that don't use drugs at all). Looking at drug deaths relative to the population is most likely wrong as the % of people consuming hard drugs varies by country. However, the article also states that:

&gt; Still, it's very clear that decriminalisation hasn't had the severe consequences that its opponents predicted. As the Transform Drug Policy Institute says in its analysis of Portugal's drug laws, ""The reality is that Portugal’s drug situation has improved significantly in several key areas. Most notably, HIV infections and drug-related deaths have decreased, while the dramatic rise in use feared by some has failed to materialise.""

So that facts are still that 1. death rates are very low 2. the situation improved.

You're looking at actual sales, rather than asking prices on RightMove, right?

&gt;  There are two or three new build flats in the area

New build flats tend to be more expensive than they really ought to be.

&gt; Does vacant possession increase the price of the flat?

It makes it much easier to sell. If there's a sitting tenant, then the only people who will buy are landlords - and they will be suspicious that the flat is only being sold to get rid of an awkward tenant.

&gt; Am I right in saying fewer years on a lease will lower the value of the flat

Short leases *massively* reduce the value. Leaseholders now have the right to extend the lease, but only at defined prices: And the prices are increasingly favourable to the freeholder in the last 60 years of the lease. Here's an online calculator: http://www.myleasehold.co.uk/lease-extension-calculator

The guy I was training alongside who had zero previous bike experience when I did my A2 (after 3 months on a 125) did manage to muck up his mod 1 test by putting his foot down on the u-turn, but if he hadn't done that he would've had a perfect pass.

That said, the school I go to does seem to be outstanding - 100% pass rate for Mod2 for the last 10 months or something like that, and only that one failure on mod 1. 

Point is, there is zero need to ride a 125 for any longer than a day. The only difference with a larger bike is that it'll be heavier and require a softer hand on the throttle, which requires both a bit more restraint and a bit more finesse. With the right bike, maneuvering is no harder than on a 125 - the MT-03, for instance, I found easier to manage than my CBR125, and is about the same as a YBR125.

New social media registration?

2. Of course they are brand new - the company is newly incorporated, we didn't have anything prior as this was a new concept &amp; idea for us!

UK Registration number:

3. The company is registered in the UK - http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//compdetails - you can search with the company number - 09615567 

URL not paid for? - It is, have a search on any domain registration for www.pegasusgaming.co.uk - we are in the process of setting up a website still at the moment

Finally - ""scamming"" how at any point has this been a scam? We are NOT asking for money, we are NOT asking for a payment for anything, everything has been paid for out of our own pockets and all we want is to provide a decent service to UK gamers!

I'm so scared to add anything into my routine - thinking about buying an oil cleanser (I've been testing using baby oil before my foaming cleanser, skin seems ok with it), a Vit C serum (still reading reviews), tested out some vitamin E facial oil from the Body Shop that my friend gave me, face was ok with it. I've been looking into improving my skin texture at the moment, trying to work out whether I have CCs (I have a few whiteheads that disappear after cleaning), because I'm still not quite sure my last AHA did anything for me (Olay Elixir), as my skin seems quite happy without it.

My only real problem is the Oilatum moisturiser is £14 off Amazon and is out of stock everywhere else. Why is it when you find the right thing it disappears?! I've been looking into AB moisturisers, it might be time to get some samples off eBay.

Edit: I also made myself a giant spreadsheet of every product I've used so I can tackle what ingredients irritated my skin or not (using COSDNA &amp; ingredient lists for reference), so far it's looking like my suspicions on fatty alcohols were right, still got to investigate further.

He wants the ball deep, holds up play and brings other players into the attack. He also has a penchant for shooting outside the box, which means he hardly ever makes runs straight into the box and always lingers outside.

I'm not really sure about that. He's not dynamic enough to be an attacking midfielder. You need to create chances for your teammates. He's lazy and someone like him will kill the attack in transition. Had a passing accuracy of 70%. He can only succeed as a striker.

One thing I will concede that he is technically quite good. But that technicality is of no use if he's not arsed. Needs to get the basics right. A player like Balotelli with technique and strength, if gets his positioning and movements right can be really good. Needs to work hard and needs a team that will play to his strength. Should learn from Ibra's game.

I wouldn't want 100k a week rotting on the bench when we can give that kind of money to someone far more talented than Balotelli who will actually contribute to the team.",null,0,null,1433595358,null,0,false,0,crxh2qt,null,t3_38q332,null,t1_crxh2qt,null,t1_crxfxrx,null,null,null,1437568764,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

I do also believe the world might have been a far worse place if Saddam had genuinely obtained WMD. He'd already demonstrated an appetite for genocide on his own people – something *some* of us were outraged by decades before it became a popular pretext for the 2001 invasion – and he thought nothing of deploying chemical weapons during his war with Iran. And while the stories of the grizzly methods he used to murder his political opponents were undoubtedly exaggerated, there is no doubt whatsoever that he *did* have them murdered. He also routinely had his people tortured and subjected them to brutal repression. 

What Bush &amp; Blair did was terrible, yes – criminal, even – and I think it's disgraceful that the deceptions they used to justify the war in Iraq haven't been grounds for at least bringing them to trial.

---

&gt;Millin is best remembered for playing the pipes whilst under fire during the [D-Day landing in Normandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings).  Pipers had traditionally been used in battle by Scottish and Irish soldiers.  However, the use of [bagpipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagpipes) was restricted to rear areas by the time of the Second World War by the British Army. Lovat, nevertheless, ignored these orders and ordered Millin, then aged 21, to play. When Private Millin demurred, citing the regulations, he recalled later, Lord Lovat replied: ""Ah, but that’s the English War Office. You and I are both Scottish, and that doesn’t apply."" He played ""[Hielan' Laddie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hielan%27_Laddie)"" and ""[The Road to the Isles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_the_Isles)"" as his comrades fell around him on [Sword Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Beach).  Millin states that he later talked to captured German snipers who claimed they did not shoot at him because they thought he was crazy.

Option 1 (New 01/02 number);

1. Sign up for a VOIP provider or Skype number and tell HR you're changing your number. Use this number henceforth for calls.
2. Use a SIP App / Skype for calling.
3. If you need 2way SMS, providers like AAISP can help.

Option 2 (Keep your 07 number but forward it over VOIP).

1. Buy a Portech MV-370 or GoIP GSM Gateway, because Ofcom is a **** and doesn't let you port 07 numbers to non-mobile methods.
2. Install SIM (violates most T&amp;C's, except for Three, iirc) and place it somewhere with decent signal and wired internet (house?)
3. Next you need a PBX, something like Asterisk. There are hosted solutions for this if your can't wrap your head around it.
4. Attach the GSM Gateway to your PBX
5. Use a SIP App for calling on the PBX.

Let me explain this one...I won the MySpurs competition to play FIFA15 with Kane, Mason, Vorm and Yedlin at the lane this year. We got to choose shirts and numbers, I'm a big Bentaleb fan so went for that. Kane and Mason signed it at the end, I'm looking to get it signed by Bentaleb before I frame it which will in its own way turn it into a kind of ""breakout season"" shirt with the three academy lads shining.

Potentially one of the last shirts he signed before leaving, I got this not long before his official departure. Chuffed to have got it before it was too late. Massively need to frame this.

Secondly, we NEED to sign a big name in this transfer period. Defensive and tactical stability will be highly increased by bringing in Pogba. Furthermore, Cesc will be available to play amc more often, so Oscar will have more to work for. 
The other option would be Sterling, who will mess up our attacking midfield line. Hazard could then have a breather now and then, or play central role. There is also an option to let Cuardado go. 
The ideal option is that they both come. We have the funds, we can pay for it.

Furthermore, we need a class striker. Buying falcao is a bit too risky, but the way we play is way better for him than style of man utd - we could get him on a loan, with an option to buy.

So, we are signing: Falcao (loan), Sterling or Griezzmann for about (40-50 mil), Pogba (70 mil), and some youth prospects.

Players out: Mikel (10 mil) or ramires (25 mil), Kakuta (i think he is a free agent this summer), Cuadrado (30 mil) [if we get sterling], Romeu (3 mil.), Davilla (1 mil.), McEachran (4 mil), Moses (4-6mil), Marin (we should actually pay clubs to take him), Omeruo (2-3 mil), Salah (extends loan), Delač (last year of contract, he will be sold, for 1 mil at least).

About a year later I was in a shop with my mom and she asked me if I wanted one of the football kits. One was blue, the other red. Since I love that particular colour of blue (it was the 97/98 one) and my mate constantly talked about Chelsea I chose that one.

Two days later I watched the Charity Shield (between United and Chelsea) and thought Dennis Wise was the coolest character ever. Wanted to be just like him. That was that. Became a ravenous supporter after that match. Desailly and Weah coming over from Milan helped a lot too.

Incidentally, the most hate I got was from the Liverpool supporters at my school, who would use all the same shite they give us now (spending too much, no history etc) which is why I get particular satisfaction when we beat them.

He didn't say he wanted it to be forced on anyone by state sanction.  Rather that if someone who was gay wanted to try it then the state should help.  Sounds like barking at the moon to me, but it isn't homophobic.

&gt;UKIP also kicked out its youth leader due to supporting gay marriage;

No, they didn't.  They told Olly (who was in a temporary position) that it wasn't his job to promote non-party policy and to court the press using his position as UKIP youth leader.  They warned him several times.  Yet he continued writing things like why from a Libertarian position he was talking about incest and beastiality and the BNP.  Then he decided, despite warnings, to give radio interviews on his articles.

The opposite is true.  They were criticised by some because they didn't have a separate section in their manifesto mentioning LGBT.  In fact they didn't even mention the word 'gay' or the acronym LGBT in their manifesto.  What they did mention in their manifesto was:

If the language policies of today had been enacted back then, along with Welsh medium schools, then the language would be in a far stronger position ...maybe even the majority language today? Like it is in Quebec for example.

As you mentioned Tryweryn would have never happened, not sure about Aberfan but I guess that depends on whether the ""Welsh Coal Board"" had the same management problems that the National Coal Board had in reality.

Speaking about coal, if the parliament had control of energy and natural resources then much of the money raised by the industry could have stayed in Wales rather then going straight to Westminister.

And then the big one - Thatcher wouldn't have been able to close the mines. Now I have no doubt that eventually many of them would have closed, that's the inevitability of mining a non-renewable fuel, but it would have been a *process*, and it would have been a far more moderate approach; smaller mines closed down and the workforce consolidated into larger and more profitable mines, while the Welsh Government would have probably tried to get other alternative industries to slowly take their place. Not the dangerous, authoritarian, slash and burn approach that Thatcher took. In the end, like Tower Colliery I imagine many of the larger coal mines might have continued running right into the 2000s, maybe even today.

Edit: And another thing, depending on the Welsh Government of the day the [Beeching Cuts might of not have happened](http://www.bilderberg.org/maps.jpg), meaning among others the Carmarthen to Aber Line wouldn't have closed and it would still be possible to travel from North to South Wales without having to go though England.

I think you need to appreciate that 90% of the adult population forget about 90% of the stuff they were taught in maths in high school....because we don't ever use it.

When I was 16, sure I could factorise equations, convert fractions and re-arrange equations but I can't do any of that anymore because I don't need to. One of my friends is a mental health nurse, he doesn't need to know quadratic equations to do his job, one of my other friends is a gardener, he doesn't need to know how to use formulas for this job. Another works at the cinema, she doesn't need to understand trigonometry for hers. I currently work as a classroom cover supervisor, I've never needed to know how to solve probability equations to do my job.

We do all use some maths in our lives...and largely it's primary school level maths- addition, subtraction, how much change am I owed? How much is this TV worth if it's 20% of? And also basic budgeting, can I afford a holiday this year If I save £2000 for it? The simple maths we use all the time, but the complex stuff that you learn at GCSE level you forget basically because you don't ever use it. If you remember it, good for you, but don't expect us to. 

I honestly wouldn't expect any students from the history classes i've covered to remember in their adult life that the Glorious Revolution happened in 1688, or for the kids in the Year 8 German class I TA'd in the other day to remember that ""gelb"" is yellow in German. Hopefully though, they'll retain the skills they've developed through the experience of learning a particular subject, which will help them immensely in their adult life.

People keep clamoring on about signing a DM too, but that likely won't happen. Rodgers hates having a traditional defensive base to his midfield and tries to avoid it.

Can we all just understand that Milner is a very very versatile midfielder. He is capable of doing everything in midfield, he has very high work rate for pressing too.

Some CM's are better at their pressing game and recycling than getting stuck in tackles and in the air. Not Milner, he's capable of doing just about everything in midfield, however other midfielders can do their roles BETTER, it doesn't deny the fact he can literally do everything. 

He's been played out on the wing, in a more forward position if really needs be - then put into more DM/CM role, specially in European games for City - even played at RB when needs be.

tldr; he has the qualities to do everything, however obviously other players can do their roles better.

People get scammed. Granny's get scammed by dodgy builders. Kids get scammed and end up buying a ten bag of parsley. A scam is often something that involves deliberate misinformation, often followed by a swift exit. 

The NHS hasn't been scammed. The private companies have not suddenly changed the terms and conditions of the deal suddenly, grabbed the loot and hightailed it to Bermuda. **Simply, the NHS has got a portfolio of shit contracts.** It is that simple...

The people signing them off were too incompetent to understand what they were signing, and did not bother to conduct proper due diligence on what they were signing before they signed....

Either that or there was organised collusion, which is moving into criminal territory.

A top 10 employer in the world should have enough sense to conduct proper due diligence on any deal it undertakes.

Henderson and Milner both have fantastic work rate and stamina; asking them to play as the deepest midfielders means they have to take turns sitting back as a defensive shield. It's better to have a holding player behind them, allowing them both license to get forward to press and to attack. Neither is a fantastic defender either, so you run the risk of them sitting back but still getting beaten in a 50-50.

One of our biggest attacking issues under Rodgers is our struggles against teams that play with 2 holding midfielders and a narrow &amp; compact back four, and then use their front 4 on the counter-attack. Think his first league game against West Brom, think most of our matches against Palace and Villa, think our latest loss to Stoke. All of these teams flood the central areas where we love to create, leaving us space out wide because they know we can't hurt them from there, and then use fast wide players to hit us on the break.

Your formation leaves plenty of space out wide for them to exploit, and relies solely on central creators for attacking. It makes us even worse against our biggest tactical weakness.

Also, there's no need for all 3 of Sterling/Lallana, Coutinho and Kovacic to play centrally.

It's clear this formation is just designed to shoehorn players into a starting XI.

The fact of the matter is Skrtel isn't as good as most think he is. He was rubbish in 13/14, absolutely shocking. We conceded a staggering amount of goals that year and he started most of the games due to injuries to Sakho and Agger. This season just gone he wasn't great either, people keep saying he was consistent. Ya he was consistently bang average. We need to hold higher standards for our defenders. Sure loads may think he was the best, but just because he played the most games isn't a reason he should be considered the best. He spent a chunk of the year shielded in what was effectively a back 5.

I don't think we're paying other lads more to sit on the bench, because I think this deal is an indication that we're not going to start Skrtel anymore, which is a good thing. Since he became starter in 09 we have had 1 top 4 finish. He's just not very good and people are blinded by the fact that he's this big tough looking nasty CB when he's not at all. We need to change our defence and find a new partner for Sakho because Skrtel's lack of positioning sense and defensive organisational skills wreak chaos.

It's not torture if the person requests, can stop it, and is informed on the lack of evidence behind it.  But I wouldn't stop them from trying if they wanted to, forever how much I doubt it works.  I'd also hope they were offered counselling and support groups as an alternative.  But if a gay person wants to try it, however misguided you or I might think it, it's not homophobic to allow them.

They wouldn't be trying to correct them in the state's eyes, they'd be helping them to come to terms with their denial.  And if somebody wants it, because they're not ready to come to terms with it, then who are you and I to judge?

Keynes wrote and argued during a particular time period and his word is not gospel and it is not universally applicable. Keynesian thought has evolved over time and now we have proper Keynesians (the Post-Keynesians) and bastardised Keynesian thought (New Keynesianism). As for the right type of spending, I really don't think it exists. Whichever spending programmes make the country richer and more equitable are the best if you ask me. 

But as for your main point, which is, when do we stop ... well, when we have properly high inflation (which we obviously didn't have in those dark days under Brown) or properly high debt (which we haven't had in generations), then you may have a point. 

Let me ask you something. As a supposed Keynesian (and please elaborate on what kind of Keynesian you are), what's wrong with spending as a nation (as opposed to as a household)? 

Why are average individuals entrusted with the country's money (Cameron and Osborne's idea of a hardworking family) more trustworthy than a group of individuals that have been to the best schools and universities and passed rigorous application procedures to run the country as part of the Cabinet or the Civil Service? Are you saying that we don't need as much central government spending? 

Is there a point where we just say to the country: well, that's it, everyone, we've reached a figure where certain people say we have to, as a country, stop spending as much. If you're disabled, poor, in bad health or just unlucky, well, sorry, but we can't do anything for you now.

The ""no drippy oil"", rinses clean and portability parts are nice, but I'm not a fan of the emulsified product running down my arm. We'll see if this makes into my routine.

Have they long been known to be anti-gay rights? I wasn't aware of this one myself.

I did a search for 'homosexuality' and 'gay' on their website, and only found one salient link: http://www.ukip.org/ukip_s_roger_helmer_responds_to_today_s_attack

I did a broader search and did find a few articles and blogs discussing the issue, but nothing authoritative from the horse's mouth. From 2013 I found this policy:

&gt; GAY MARRIAGE: UKIP supports the concept of civil partnerships, but opposes the move to legislate for same-sex marriage, which it says risks ""the grave harm of undermining the rights of Churches and Faiths to decide for themselves whom they will and will not marry"".

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22396690

but then found this from 2014:

&gt;Nigel Farage has changed tack and announced that Ukip would not seek to overturn gay marriages.

&gt; The Ukip leader, who warned in 2012 that legalising gay marriage would force some churches to conduct ceremonies that are ""anathema to them"", said his party would accept same-sex marriages if it won the general election.

If you have a local real ale brewery, you can get ""Bright"" beer, that is not pasteurized, or left too long in a pub cellar. But it only keeps for a few days like bread or milk. Much easier on the guts.

Many studies show that, at a younger age, homework is a huge indicator of educational improvement i.e. Kids that do homework do better in school.  *But* it may well be that this is not due to the fact that homework makes you learn better or more but that kids who do homework have better engaged parents and kids who have engaged parents/ a more stable home life do better at school. Causality vs correlation. 

When you get older, it's more mixed and lots of research shows that homework is a stressor. I'm not an expert on this, and I haven't read every paper though. More importantly, I have concerns about what lesson homework teaches students as people - in effect the message is 'there is more work than can be reasonably achieved during the time allotted to school (work) so you need to do this in your own time'. 

No wonder working hours get longer and longer for adults.

Now not to defend it but DLA worked the same way for new claimants, you fill in the form and send it in and you don't get and money (backdated) until the DWP assess it and award your rates. I understand they've changed this for PIP so even people people re-assessed lose their money if they have to appeal, so if they reject it's stopped until they re-award it.

A friend of mine went through the DLA in 2009, i'll convey that here as i helped with it, PIP probably isn't that much different. Enjoy the farce.

Filled in the form in Jan 09, about a couple months later get a rejection letter back saying they were denied on the sole reason that the ""Health Care Professional"" reading the form felt they could walk 50 meters unaided. Now they usually contact your GP to get a letter so we went back to the GP and informed them of my friends current state (on retrospect should have done this first time around) and what they could do.

So he appeals and we get back the same letter again, HCP says 50m unaided. Appeal a third time, same shit. Now this HCP has never met this person and apparently knows better than the GP who did.

By this time 7 months have elapsed so it's about middle of July. After the third appeal we actually get some help from an adviser for the illness my friend has, nice lady who knows the system and helps other understand it. She helps us push for a tribunal as obviously appeals are worthless.

So we get a tribunal date for end of September, adviser agrees to come with us. Now if you don't know what a DWP tribunal involves, it is this: you wait in an area a good 20m from the office so they can see you walk in, once in you are seated across a big desk from three people, usually doctors. Now imagine you had to do this on your own, it's pretty intimidating.

Now me, my friend and the adviser get there, we shoved in a waiting room for a while. They call us in and he walks slowly into this office and all three can see him do this. We sit down and it starts with usually intros and shit, pleasant enough.

Now after that these three doctors took it in turn to grill every detail of his medical history and treatment. He suffers with memory problems and recall under stress, so he's taking his time and he remembers one thing a little wrong, something to do with out-patient treatment frequency. One doctor pulls him up on this and he repeats what he said, she then goes off on one and without saying it basically calls him a liar.

This is about 15 minutes in and it pretty much puts the rest of it to the wayside, the doctor insists that they can't continue until detailed proof of these treatments can be verified by the hospital themselves. It seemed like a minor thing to quibble over to me, this has nothing to do with his mobility and care requirements (the whole point of the DLA). So the tribunal ends there with me feeling shocked at how he was treated and him exhausted and upset.

Once we got outside i talked to the adviser we brought with us who has been to these things before and even she was shocked. Particularly that the meeting had been cut short over this point, the fucking 50m unaided claim that the HCP in the appeals felt was so important wasn't even discussed.

We ask the adviser about complaining and she said you can but it isn't worth it. Next step is we get the evidence they demanded ASAP; so we do. Once submitted we wait a couple of weeks and the tribunal have decided to sent out a GP to do a home assessment in November.

Now this is actually a good thing and probably should be done with any appeal where in person assessment is obviously needed. So they doc comes out and does the assessment around the beginning of November and we then wait back from the tribunal/DWP on the DLA claim.

It's now december, we hear back with a copy of the doctors assessment as well. Awarded low rate care and low rate mobility, back-dated for 11 months. Now we had the adviser read over the report and she said the low rate care was fair enough but said that the doctors report is clearly showing high rate mobility is needed based on the doctors ratings.

So she writes a letter basically saying, what the fuck you give low rate on this doctors report, you fucking stupid or something? Now after new years we get a letter back saying he has been awarded high rate mobility, and backdated for a year.

Now i know that is a long arse post but you can see how much crap disabled people sometimes have to go through. It took a year, a specialist and experienced adviser, 3 appeals, a tribunal, a doctors visit and a polite WTF letter to get that claim sorted.

Now imagine you have no friends who can help or an adviser, your disabled, struggle with memory and using a pen (to fill out forms and letters), exhausted from very little activity only made worse by stress and you go through this bullshit? Yeah you'd give up.

I've heard that PIP is even harsher than this, you basically have to be bed ridden and shitting yourself to get rates needed to not starve. DLA was tough, PIP is downright unfair, you going to be seeing a lot more disabled people in hospitals, hostels and maybe even homeless from the reassessments.

If you start falling behind your personal standard, it's going to be noticed and acted upon. In state education no one will notice - or act - unless you start falling *seriously* behind. You need discipline and a good work ethic to keep your own standards up. 

How are you supposed to develop that with no homework? Classes that cater to all skill levels will by definition be too easy for a large portion of the class. If you've spent the first 11 years in education coasting through a nice easy school day, going home and switching off, how are you going to adjust when classes stop being easy?

Even if the homework itself isn't particularly challenging, getting in to the habit of studying productively at home and without teacher support is hugely valuable. State schools can't stretch all their pupils, but they can at least equip them to deal with a challenge when it eventually arises.

Milner has deep passing ability, so he should be a CM, but he also has pace and crossing abilities, so he should be a wide midfielder. I'm torn. I guess it's a good thing to be torn between, having a quality player for both of those positions, but I feel like it kept Pellegrini and Milner up at night, just like it should keep Rogers up at night.

Assuming Milner gets his way, and is played in the midfield, I see a formation along the lines of a 4-1-3-2 or a 4-1-4-1 depending on the opponent. In these formations, Milner will be wide on either side of the midfield, but will still sit deeper in the park than a traditional winger would. This gives him opportunities to lead counters and use his crossing abilities, while also still letting him support the defense and engage in general CM type play. 

The team is going to change a lot with Milner in it and Stevie gone, and it's too tell 100% how the team will be set up. If we get that Russian lad from Real Madrid, who is an out and out winger, I can imagine a more traditional 4-3-3 with Milner on either side of the holding mid. If we invest more in strikers, then I can see Milner on the wide part of a 4-1-3-2. It all depends on who else we get. It also depends on what strengths Rogers recognizes in Milner, and how he chooses to cultivate and implement them in games.

Right wing anti-immigration tends to be more focused on concerns of cultural cohesion, undermining of 'Western values', that kind of thing. Left wing anti-immigration is more concerned with issues of labour competition and undermining 'Labour solidarity'. 

I think if anti-immigration has been more associated with the right wing, it's only because in the last few decades anti-immigration has been the position of the Right, including newspapers of the Right (the Mail, the Telegraph, mainly). Meanwhile, anti-immigration is an Old Left position, while the New Left is generally pretty pro-immigration, reflected in the line taken in the modern Left's newspapers (Guardian, Independent).

Henderson and Milner both don't have the defensive awareness to play the holding role. They would need an anchor to help them. So if we were going for a double pivot ideally we'd have an anchor like Lucas and one of the two of them. Playing both would gets us in a lot of defensive bother.

I'm really worried we're going to sell Lucas and not replace him. I think we need to keep Lucas and buy a holding player. Unless Can can step up into that role. 

In a separate thread about potential line ups. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/38lh3j/does_this_possible_lineup_for_next_season_look/crvz17d) comment sums up what I think our most likely to happen transfers would be ideally lined up as. 

[This formation](http://lineupbuilder.com/2014/custom/?sk=7sx58) is how I would hope we would lineup the most. I'd ideally like more cover for left back, goal keeper and holding midfielder with those players, but you get the idea. 

It's not that I don't want Kovacic, obviously he's an amazing talent, but we don't *need* him. Whereas we do need strikers, fullbacks, a goalie, a holding mid etc. 

Like Markovic was bought as a great talent last summer, but we didn't end up needing him, and the money should have been used elsewhere. This is my feeling with Kovacic.

During the interview, I was asked about the Irish bakers who refused to put a message on a cake which supported marriage equality, because of their beliefs. In my view, this particular matter was not about discrimination, but rather personal freedoms and what constitutes them, including the freedom to object. Both equality and freedom of speech are fundamental rights— and this case underscores how we need to ensure one isn’t compromised in the pursuit of the other. I know many disagree with my sentiments, including the courts. I respect and understand their position, especially in this important climate where the tides of prejudices and inequality are (thankfully) turning. What I cannot respect is that some have conflated my position on this single matter to assume I’m anti-equality or that I share the personal beliefs of the bakers. Nothing, absolutely nothing, could be further from the truth. I have long championed the rights of the LGBT community, because equality should not only be, as the people of Ireland powerfully showed the world, universally embraced, but treasured.""

Body-less heads tend, naturally, to decay and rot. Loss of awareness is almost immediate. The headless monks have a way to conserve both the head and the self-awareness. The decay still occurs, but slower, and the self-awareness seems to be preserved even after the event of skeletonization. The same process would be applied to Jack's head, influencing the way his regeneration occurs. We have a (perhaps) force to preserve his head, another to regenerate. The way these conflicting forces interact, coupled with the almost infinite lifespan, could end up in making his body not regrowing, the regrowth body mass being redirected to grow his head (with some mutations that may create those ballsy dreadlock appendages) and the natural aging process making his facial features change to what they became to be as shown in S01E02.

EDIT: In the series is somewhat implicit that the existence of a headless monk is dependent on the preservation of the body donor's head. That explains why Dorium Maldovar's and others' heads were preserved in that vault. It opens up the possibility of a headless monk wreaking havoc around the universe while the FoB is still alive. Creepy, but it somewhat preserves balance.

In the spring and early summer, their diet features a great deal of oats, giving an earthy savoury appeal, although it can be somewhat bland.

The greater availability of lambs later in the summer leads to a much more meat-heavy consistency, with the distinctive piquancy of offal.

Over winter, the haggis grazes wild, feeding on onions and other hardy plants, and may be provided additional sustenance in the form of nutmeg, mace, and cinnamon. The effect of these flavours increase during the darkest months, but beyond late January they can take on an acrid, scorched aroma. Tradition has it that a haggis caught on the 25th January will have the best combination of flavours before this spoiling occurs, hence ""Burns Night"" celebrations.

I suspect that it's impossible to breed haggis in a different environment without it fundamentally changing these complex processes. Differences in both flora and fauna, a climate which is less likely to contribute to the 12-month cold-steaming effect, and the lack of midges to reduce the liquid content all combine to create something which emigrees from Scotland dismissively referred to as 'mock haggis', nowadays abbreviated to 'McHaggis' or alternatively called a 'value meal'.",null,0,null,1433618231,null,0,1433626289,0,crxr4vh,null,t3_38tltd,null,t1_crxr4vh,null,t3_38tltd,null,null,null,1436780334,null,21,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,21,null

As you would in the 'normal' way, you're looking for two numbers that add to -7.

As the coefficient of (number before) x is not 1, you have to multiply that **and** the end number.

So you're looking for two numbers that add to -7 and times to (2*-15=)-30.

So that's -10 and +3.

Then put them into the brackets like this:

I don't believe it does, no.

&gt; fuels homophobia by perpetuating the myth that it's a curable illness or even a subconscious choice 

It doesn't fuel that it should be cured, and if it's argued via the NHS it should be argued by practitioners against it.  That doesn't undermine somebody who is struggling and wants to try it, even as a means to coming to terms.

&gt;makes it harder for LGBT teenagers to come to terms with their sexuality.

Tautology from the first point, because there is nothing to say it should be forced.

But if somebody who is gay wants to try it, rather than see them spend fortunes of their own money going overseas to try it, or doublethinking themselves that it might work rather than coming to terms with it, then why deny someone who wants to try it?

And as I've said, I'd want medical practitioners that would be able to sign off on it to be also able to provide counselling or support groups.

&gt; It is shown to be dangerous to the individual and has no place being state-funded, let alone even legal in this country, at all.

Homeopathy is shown to have no medical value beyond the placebo effect but people die because it is not on the NHS.  People sign themselves out of medicine and spend thousands on a fool's errand, leaving behind the system, only to return sicker at greater cost.

I don't believe in homeopathy either, but if it means we can assure such people with homeopathic treatment on the condition they continue with normal medicine (or just medicine), then so what if they get the placebo effect and it means they keep getting help with genuine medicine?

Similarly, if someone is finding it so hard to come to terms with their sexuality and they don't want counselling, then don't send them away because you disagree with them.  By all means tell them it doesn't work from a medical perspective, tell them of the alternatives,  but allow them the cathartic biological-exegesis that how they feel really isn't a choice.

And No, listening to a gay person as a person not an orientation, however uninformed, is not homophobic - if it means them coming around to the fact that it is not something that they 'chose'.

&gt;Since ___[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)___ was first broadcast in 1963, there have been a number of exhibitions of [props](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatrical_property), costumes and [sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatrical_scenery) throughout the United Kingdom. Some have been intended to be permanent, and others seasonal; most have been staged at existing tourist locations.

So, I don't really understand this claim.

The Glorious Revolution, while it sharply restricted the potential for autocratic monarchy and abuses of power (a good thing!) was also accompanied by the (re-)introduction of sweeping restrictions on the rights of Catholics - on things like voting, parliamentary representation, inheritance, service in the armed forces etc. Laws which represent unthinkable levels of discrimination and bigotry by modern standards, and which persisted for between decades and centuries, depending on what you count. And yet when people suggest that the OO celebrating the Boyne and attendant events may appear to others to be triumphalist or anti-Catholic, these issues seem to be forgotten and it's all about the civil rights.

How do you feel about the Penal Law/Protestant Ascendancy period which followed the Glorious Revolution? Do you think it's simply separable and it's unreasonable for it to be brought up by detractors? And, more generally, do you feel it's legitimate to say that the OO had any role in many of these political developments in Ireland?

If you miss a connection due to a delayed train, you can travel on a later service. If in doubt, check with a member of station staff.

You've got plenty of time to make the connection across London, the duration of the actual tube journey once you're on the train itself is only about ten minutes.

If you have a flight delay causing you to miss your first train, then unfortunately you're out of luck. However, if you have travel insurance, this will probably reimburse the costs you incur in such a situation, but also do ask station staff nicely if you can travel on a later train anyway!

(If, by the time you get to Euston, you don't feel that you can cope with the tube, a black cab to Charing Cross would cost something roughly in the region of £15, depending on traffic.)",null,0,null,1433623573,null,0,false,0,crxtqv0,null,t3_38q13e,null,t1_crxtqv0,null,t1_crxtiyt,null,null,null,1436781660,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

Luggage space on the Virgin trains from Birmingham isn't great (we already had rather narrow trains due to accidents of history, and then to make them tilt they had to become even narrower). There are some racks at the ends of carriages, but also a few spaces in spots where seats are back-to-back, which not everyone notices. Everyone will be equally stressed about luggage, though, just join in with the grumpiness, tutting and rolling of eyes!

As a fundamentally pro-Protestant organisation, their most prominent activity (i.e. summer marching) doesn't include a discussion of Enlightenment political philosophy, it celebrates the victory of Protestant over Catholic. The original letter-writer is saying that since the reality was far more complicated than that, the OO could defuse some of the accusations of sectarianism by playing up the full complexity of the wider political situation. Even by secular standards, William was on the right side of history, so celebrating his victory doesn't have to be explicitly sectarian (though from the OO's perspective he gets major extra brownie points for being Protestant too). 

As it is, the OO is a pretty tough sell from a tolerance perspective, given that some of its internal rules are not just pro-Protestant but also anti-Catholic - can't you get kicked out for going to a Catholic funeral, or if a family member marries a Catholic? I don't think for a moment that everyone in the OO is sectarian or bigoted, but the organisation itself has a serious PR problem there.

Anecdotally from friends and my partner -  who work in these areas, the companies are genuinely using it to see how you fit in and not paying you just because they don't have to - not for free labours sake.

They are generally looking that you

- take the initiative 
- fit into the team
- aren't useless

The team is normally asked what they thought of the worker afterwords, and their verdict decides your fate.

Don't listen to to people telling you to refuse it, you simply won't get the job. If you don't like this then look elsewhere (if you can).

Treat it as a way of seeing if you like the company, if you get on with the staff and aren't useless you'll probably find you only have to do this once!

Problem is, he cannot regenerate his limbs, unless he reattaches to them which will then just heal back up by being his.

Culture change.

We need to change the mentality of so many young people and actually glamourise academic achievement rather than let it be something that you get the piss taken out of you for by your peers.

Also:


&gt; If you've spent the first 11 years in education coasting through a nice easy school day, going home and switching off, how are you going to adjust when classes stop being easy?

How about semi-annual periodical internal examinations while scrapping homework?

That would not only train students to develop their own revision schedules and study within their own time, but it also actually includes some pressure to succeed, while simultaneously reducing teachers' marking load.

Homework is generally an inconsequential nuisance but having to revise for semi-important tests every now and then actually spur independent study and learning in a way that homework never has or will.

&gt;

&gt;__Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling__ is a [fictional character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_character) played by British comedian [Peter Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cook) throughout his career. Streeb-Greebling (or Greeb-Streebling, depending on Cook's mood) is a stereotype of the upper class [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) duffer, described as ""narrow-minded"" and occasionally a ""heartless bastard"".  [John Cleese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cleese) described him as one of Cook's range of ""men, particularly English men, so trapped by their culture that they never knew how to live"". 

&gt;He was usually presented in the form of [interviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview) with various comedians or journalists acting as the interviewer, including [Chris Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Morris_(satirist\)) and [Ludovic Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovic_Kennedy).  The most common (and famous) interviewer was Cook's partner, [Dudley Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudley_Moore), in *[Beyond the Fringe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Fringe)* and *[Not Only... But Also](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Only..._But_Also)*.

I've done 8 exams so far (7 to go still), which were the easier ones. I do Sep. Science and found Bio and Chem Paper 1s easy, as I consistently revised them over the last 6 months. 

Even with such little revision, I felt very confident in my answers to questions and only felt bad about max. 5 questions in the 8 papers.

I don't feel the need to do more than 2 hours of revision in the coming 2 weeks, but I will definitely need to kick it into high gear, because the 2nd science papers will be tougher (especially Physics ;_;) and I need to look over History topics that I did a year ago.

All in all, I think everyone should do as much revision as they **personally** need. I missed a lot of time blocks but don't feel bad about it, as I still remembered/understood the material when I did the exams. I recommend you **don't focus on whether you complete every single revision block** and berate yourself if you haven't, but **aim to comprehend what you learn**. Sometimes, I learned more in 10 minutes than in 2 hours. **10 mins of reading from a Physics revision guide** helped me more than doing a shitty **2 hour English Language practice paper**. I guess it's because I dislike English with a passion (thank God I don't need more than a C in it for 6th form.

I wish good luck to everyone! This is the final push guys, don't start rationalizing how you deserve a rest because you did so much work already, get some extra energy and motivation somehow! Think about all the effort you have made in the last 5 years going away if you don't get off your ass and make sure you **know how to complete the square when someone wakes you up at 3am, with a gun to your head**.

If that doesn't do it, then watch this.

That being said I don't agree that the EU should be imposing this on member states, I think it should be up to the member states themselves to decide &amp; I personally would like to see us accept our fair share (which we're not at the moment).

Not that it would have been all sunshine and roses - de-industrialisation was on its way regardless.

The turn of the twentieth century must have been a pretty exciting time for nation builders in Wales. There was a revival of Welsh culture going on - the National Eisteddfod was still a relatively new institution (1860s), and there was a lot of interest in Welsh history coming out of London-based societies like the Cymmrodorion (revived in the 1870s). The University of Wales was founded in 1893, the National Museum in 1905 and the National Library in 1907. In 1914, the Church was disestablished in Wales - certainly the biggest single change to Welsh public life to have been brought about by an act of parliament since the annexation, and a significant departure from the established order in England.

And all the while, the cause of Welsh home rule was gaining traction. It's definitely possible to see a certain trajectory in the events of the day.

Then the two world wars happen, and all that change is put on hold for half a century.

Further constitutional change in Wales wasn't seen until the post of Minister for Welsh Affairs was created in 1951, and even then, the question didn't really become a political issue until the drowning of Cwm Tryweryn.",null,0,null,1433632211,null,0,false,0,crxxqsi,null,t3_38li2e,null,t1_crxxqsi,null,t1_crximqh,null,null,null,1436783534,null,3,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,3,null
