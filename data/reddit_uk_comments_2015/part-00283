null,false,ikkleste,eng-yorkshire,Something like Yorkshire,null,"&gt;How much of this coincides with the rise of social media and technology platforms? While the public - youth in particular - have had more and more options to engage in politics it seems to result in whining rather than actively doing something.

To me the whining is a symptom not a cause of a feeling of a lack of representation. But I've nothing to follow that up with other than its the way that makes sense. No rep... ""Lets whine about it"". Rather than ""all they do is whine... Lets represent someone else."" It's a chicken and egg situation to some degree and I'd argue it's the politians who are best placed to counter it (and keep countering it) Rather than those engaged youths who could work on influencing pols only to get them to listen when they are no longer the youth. Figuring out what influence you can have takes time by the time many figure out that while they are unrepresented now if they do what they can they may be represented in the future they are growing up.

&gt;Because the person/party you vote for doesn't get in to power should not result in a tantrum but perhaps should prompt the question ""what can we do next to get more votes?""

My point that really aside from the fringes (which thanks to fptp are filtered out) there isn't even anyone to vote for for many on the left. Its not voting for someone then complaining about the result, it's feeling disenfranchised by a process that has already decided the limits of the debate are miles away from what you are interested in. And when someone seeks to widen the debate we're told ""If you do that you'll lose forever. Those people in the left; they are irrelevant don't court that section of 34%, or even the 9% that used to vote and stopped when Labour headed centre. You've got to keep fighting for that 2% swing in the middle. Labour hasn't won on those votes for 40 years"" (ignoring they haven't *tried* to win on those votes for 23)

&gt;Taking the rough average of a 75% turnout which seems a respectable figure the question should be of those 9% or so who didnt vote in the last election are they all frustrated lefties?

Maybe not. But given that we constantly hear it's the youth that don't vote, the youth is traditionally left leaning, the youth say that they don't vote because no one is representing them, that 9% appeared as Labour moved away from the left, and no one has seen what happens if you throw a left option out there for 23 years, it might be worth a try...

&gt;The young movement out of all movements should be the most energetic, they can and should be helping shape the future that they will inherit.

Agreed. But how is the question? By protesting? I think we saw that, peaceful and violent. It changed nothing. By voting? Who for? Labour fighting over who gets to cap benfits? Lib dems? that worked out well. Anyone smaller? Fptp defeat those options before they start unless you've got a geographical advantage (and look when that happens massive left turnout and representation!)

Sure some do just sit and whine on the internet, but many engage with energy but the avenues to channel that energy is limited.

I do believe that RLC will get his chances this season and he certainly has the talent to succeed, only time will tell.
Jake Clarke-Salter has the makings of a good defender but would benefit from another season with our youth team and some time training with the likes of Terry, he is certainly not ready for the step up yet and wouldn't expect to see him get a run out this season.
Ola Aina has the least amount of potential IMO and has been taken along because of our lack of cover at wing back. I am sure he we have a good career, but I don't think it will be with us or even in the Prem in all truth.
Finally Chalobah is a player who was our academy's leading light for so long but has insofar not shown the progression that I'd like to see and he has a tendency to go missing in the bigger games. This was noticeably the case in this summers Euros where he was abject. Even during his positive spell with Watford he went missing in the playoff final. I hope I am wrong, but he would be a liability in the team at the moment which we can't risk.

Overall we should give RLC the chance to show his worth this season and continue to grow some others in the youth ranks for now. Dom, Tammy Abraham, Izzy Brown, Jay Dasilva, Musonda and Boga as well as some others have the talent to come through, but I'd say it was too soon for them all right now.

In order to prevent Slovenia or any country below us taking over our position and pushing us down the table we cannot allow lower ranked countries to take points from us.

It works just like a league. You may not be able to beat the teams or in this case countries at the top of the league/table but as long as you continue to beat teams below you over all you should not fall down any further.

In this case a country below us has gained 3 point to our 1 and has ultimately made progress on catching us and over taking us.

Our rank falling further will reduce our clubs in Europe.

It's plain to me that without a Vision we'll continue limping from one setback to the next, at best maintaining the status quo and at worst squandering our future and circling the drain. I don't regard the current setup as adequate, let alone desirable in perpetuity.

But it's equally plain after the last century that Visions pose an incredible hazard to human welfare, because by their nature they have to be pursued in defiance of any obstacles thrown up by the conventional order. Thanks to new technologies the 20th century was plagued by Visionaries like Reagan, Thatcher, Pol Pot. WW2 and the Cold War were essentially visionary conflicts, and arguably the most visionary society for hundreds of years was headed by Josef Stalin.

It seems to me that our society has subtly learned its lesson and developed defence strategies - things like irony and apathy, tall poppy syndrome, derision of politicians - a sort of immune system against grand ideas. 

We're in need of a vision to lead us forward, and yet we can no longer allow ourselves to trust in visions. So I think we'll muddle on rudderless without one for a few more decades, and then when things start to get really bad due to climate change and political instability people will start to look again for a vision to give them faith - and we'll just have to hope that for once it'll be a rational and effective one that doesn't involve causing too much additional misery.",null,0,null,1437735555,null,0,false,0,ctefstb,null,t3_3ef7rj,null,t1_ctefstb,null,t3_3ef7rj,null,null,null,1440055718,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Remember, the way our Police service conducts PR in the UK is very passive. We never come out swinging. They will release a little fairy statement apologising to relatives and to the people involved, and provide no real information in relation to the incident. Meanwhile, you'll have daily stories in the press from affected family members claiming THEY KILLED MY SON, HE WAS A GOOD BOY etc

Once it goes to court, the Police then roll out all of the circumstances and their justification and reasoning for what had occurred and that's enough to convince a jury. Yet once the jury's decision is made public you're left thinking, HOLD ON, I'VE READ ALL THESE NEWS STORIES ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED, HOW COULD THEY FIND HIM NOT GUILTY?

To give you a prime example. Right now in Scotland, we have the Sheku Bayoh death in custody. We have weekly news stories with quotes from the family on how Sheku was the kindest softest man ever, he couldn't have done what is alleged, it must have been Police brutality. 

And the whole case looks and sounds terrible on the part of the Police.

Now if the Police actually took a more confrontrational approach to defending their image, they would come out with a statement tackling the family solicitor's outrageous comments. They would come out and mention how a female Police officer had been battered by Sheku so badly that she required hospital treatment, rehabilitation and still hadn't returned to work after a month. They would explain to the public why it required CS spray, baton strikes and a dozen Police officers to get the big guy under control.

But they don't, so the public are left with nothing from the Police on 1 hand, and a million news stories with quotes from the family on the other hand. It's no wonder they don't understand how a jury reached their verdict.

The inquest into Sheku Bayoh's death will be hearing the initial calls made to Police, they'll hear the radio transmissions from the cops who arrived to find Sheku first, they'll hear the panicked shouts for assistance and the emergency button being pressed as Sheku starts to batter the cop, they'll hear testimony from the battered cop, they'll see photographs of her injuries, they'll see the medical reports and hear of the rehabilitation required. Then they reach their verdict and it's released.

And joe public is left with the verdict, yet knows nothing in relation to the case and can't understand how that verdict could be reached. I can see why the public falls into the trap they do, but if you call yourself an objective person, you must remember that you know relatively nothing about the case, and have seen a tenth of the evidence the jury has.

That seems like it would be the most logical thing to do. In general the name given to places refers to the area of land and not the city itself. For example you could take the buildings that make up the city of Belfast and move them somewhere else but it would no longer be Belfast.

 In that regard it would make sense for the area that was known as Derry to keep that name, and for the walled part of the city to be referred to as Londonderry, sort of how there is a city of London located in the area known as London.

When Ukip gained its first major breakthrough, scoring 16 per cent of the national vote in the 2004 European elections, the BBC literally wrote it out of the script. Its election graphs recorded the Ukip vote as ""other"", even though it had won more votes than the Liberal Democrats and not that many fewer than Labour. For some years thereafter, BBC political reporters continued to ignore Ukip – until Nigel Farage's rise to prominence in the run-up to the 2015 election forced them to come to terms with a phenomenon they did not like and could not comprehend.

I think you might be right with Marko, think if we got somewhere near our money back the club would accept a bid. I do think he's got the potential to be a good player though, I hope he stays.

Yeah Can isn't gonna be sent on loan, but I do worry about his first team game time. I have a sneaking suspicion he might be made captain of a 2nd string Europa league team, hopefully that's enough to keep him happy.

I get what you're saying about Origi but for the price we paid he's going to need results. Last season BR almost refused to play 2 up top, which means Ings will more likely be first choice striker in a 2nd string team, so unless Origi plays out wide (beating Marko and Ibe to places) he's going to be used as an impact sub.

So, what has happened is that the UN High Commisioner for Human Rights - the UN body that represents the worlds commitments to Human Rights (that's a good thing) - has undertaken a study of the UKs legal commitment to Human Rights, along with every other country in the world (this current session looked at the UK, Canada, France, Span, Macedonia, Uzbekistan and Venezuala).

You can find the reports here - http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/SessionDetails1.aspx?SessionID=899&amp;Lang=en

The concluding observations are recommendations on how the UK can bring itself up to the recognised international standard of Humand Rights.

The full text on the smacking issue is  -

""20.	The Committee remains concerned that corporal punishment is still not fully outlawed in the home and certain educational and alternative care facilities in the United Kingdom and in almost all British Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories. It is further concerned about the lack of explicit prohibition of corporal punishment in the home and the existing legal defences of “reasonable punishment” in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or “justifiable assault” in Scotland (arts. 7 and 24). 


The State party should take practical steps, including through legislative measures where appropriate, to put an end to corporal punishment in all settings, including the home, throughout United Kingdom and all Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories, and repeal all existing legal defences across the State party’s jurisdiction. It should encourage non-violent forms of discipline as alternatives to corporal punishment, and conduct public information campaigns to raise awareness about its harmful effects.""

Sounds perfectly reasonable to me, but then I'm not Rupert fucking Murdoch.

I think it depends what people mean by nationalism. Obviously you voted for them because you liked their policies, and that's going to be the dominating factor for most people. But their policies really weren't that different from Labour; just looking at policies doesn't on its own explain the total and utter landslide of a thrashing Labour received north of the border. 

I wouldn't dream of claiming that the SNP were some sort of swastika-wielding nationalist group wanting to expel the dirty foreigner or any of that rubbish. But on the other hand, they have a great dose of appeal by their claims to be localist. That they will do better for Scotland because their focus is wholly on Scotland. Let me put it this way- if their only appeal is that they are a centre left party, do you think they would be just as popular in Scotland if they changed their name to remove reference to Scotland and started contesting seats in the south? What if the party leader came from Oxford and represented a London seat? Would they still see landslide support in Scotland under those circumstances?

Perhaps you think they would, and that's fair enough. But to me it looks like a big part of their appeal to Scottish people is that they solely represent Scotland, that they aren't part of the ""bubbles"" elsewhere in the country, that they are focused solely on the needs of the people they claim to represent.

Sure they are, and on demand services like iPlayer or so indicative of that right? 

There are two different issues here and people love to throw them into one single pot.

Firstly the ""**I don't like x, so why are the BBC showing x?**"" problem. 

Secondly the fact that no one seems to have a concrete idea about what the BBC should be for, and so decide the BBC is stuck in the past despite the fact that they are just as forward thinking as any other TV company. In fact more so since they pretty much were the first TV broadcaster to provide on-demand shows. Long before ITV or C4.

The first issue can be solved easily enough by remembering the world does not revolve around you and your opinions. The second one is something the BBC, along with all other TV broadcasters, need to answer. The BBC is not stuck in the past, it is stuck in the present. 

This links onto this: 
&gt; There is a multitude of media, both broadcast and internet.

You are right, the BBC know this. But it is not there job to make money, they have a mandate and for better or worse they stick to it. They do not compete with other media, that has never been true, and in fact, it is less true now then ever before. I no longer have to pick between what's on BBC one and C4, I can watch them both, even if they are on at the same time, so where is the competition? Same goes for online. The content is sitting there waiting for *me*, it plays when I want it, when it's convenient for me.

Add in the TTP treaty which gives companies the right to sue if they feel any govt has disadvantaged them, and you've got a dogs dinner.

I'm going to be voting Out in the EU referendum as you've probably guessed. I don't want to nationalise everything like Corbyn -  but I don't like that foreign entities are restricting what our govt can do. I want our govt to be able to nationalise if it makes sense at some point in the future without having having to beg for permission.

How exactly do you expect this to scale?

Personally, I like to leave plenty of time for long journeys, and usually stop for a break half way through as well. I sit at around 63mph on the motorway. If traffic's bad, or I'm running late, I can speed up to 70 to take 10% off my travel time, and skip my break to save a further 20 minutes. Only been late for something once this year, and that was because of an accident a short way ahead of me on the motorway.

I refuse to switch lanes in very slow traffic, it's not worth the additional concentration as far as I'm concerned. I just amble along at idle listening to the radio, with about a lorry's length of space in front of me for people who are in a rush or need to come across.

In rush hour, I don't bother overtaking people all that often. We all end up queueing together at the traffic lights anyway, I'd only gain a couple of seconds for it. Again, not worth the extra hassle.

Having said that, the article points out quite clearly that speeding and lane-switching do save time, and appears to be quite poorly written. There's greater than a 25% time reduction going from 55 to 75mph, which would make a huge difference on a long journey.

It's sad that we can't do much about it either because so many are like this and so many in our country could do better with that money.

* A one-way drive from King's Cross station to Speaker's House after a day trip to Leeds in July 2013 cost £168.  
* He kept a chauffeur driven car waiting while he attended a memorial service for former minister Malcolm Wicks in Croydon, south London in October 2012 - costing £289 for five hours.  
* The Speaker had a Foreign Office car pick him up at Manchester Piccadilly station after travelling up to attend the funeral of Labour MP Paul Goggins in January last year. It ferried Mr Bercow and a staff member around “as directed” at a cost of £298, before they stayed at the Park Inn Radisson hotel in the centre of the city.  
* The following day, it took Mr Bercow and two staff members to the service in Salford, waiting and dropping them back to Manchester Piccadilly at a further cost of £276. In total, the Speaker and his staff ran up expenses of nearly £1,300 attending the service.  
* Mr Bercow and an aide charged 299 US dollars (£192) for dinner while staying at the five-star Strand hotel in Rangoon during an official visit in the summer of 2013. The hotel's website says it offers “grand colonial splendour”.  
* Long distance calls totalling 63 euros (£44) were made from Mr Bercow's room during a visit to Vienna in May 2013.

She does have some interesting ideas when it comes to health services, however, I think she's unfortunate in that it's also Burnham's only real area of specific focus so far.

In reality the subsidy for domestic green energy production was only ever intended to be a stimulus to green energy, with a particular focus on solar. It was always going to be axed once the industry picked up, it's just that the industry has picked up faster than anyone expected.

Now that Solar energy has started to absolutely sky-rocket in uptake, the subsidy cannot be justified as it only serves to push up prices in an industry that is now more than capable of sustaining itself. The subsidy was actually costing more to tax-payers and people who wanted to invest in solar. It was also a source of considerable (and growing) corruption.

If you want to see first hand evidence of solar power industry kicking off in the UK, come to Lincolnshire. Fields of what used to be rape-seed are now plastered with solar cells.

Well not in the same way, opposition to austerity is what would unite them but it is second fiddle to devolution, environmentalism, etc. Even then Labour has responded by abstaining on the finance bill, letting the SNP claim that left ground.

For me these different groups are too all over the place to a) attract enough support to break through the barriers of the electoral system b) gather all comers under the banner of ""the left"" Rather than feeding off each other c) mobilise people who are disenfranchised from the whole system making them feel like there is a alternative.

For me this is why I hope Corbyn does do well. I'm no supporter of the current Labour party but could see someone from within them could be a rallying point for this disparate and disenfranchised left. 

Ideally it would someone outside of Labour a leftie farage-a-like to demonstrate to labour there's fertile ground and unclaimed votes to the left. But that seems impossible as any new candidate would just add to the throng and any existing one has different priorities (see Sturgeon and devolution). So it has to come from within Labour and I think Corbyn could be that guy. I hope it doesn't tear them apart and just wakes them up to the idea that fighting for the centre isnt the only way. But I can see that it might.

Corbyn probably wouldn't stand for general election so he'd have to make a splash and show someone else that the room and support is there before 2020. It's an interesting political experiment.

Maybe you are right about a lack of new ideas, theres lots of ideas out there but some are pretty wacky and as you say youthful. But I think we need to start maturing some of them making them into something the mainstream can buy into, a new left. It worries me that Corbyn might not be this. But I can't see us producing anything like that without getting it up there in the debate and the best way to do that is to pull the direction of Labour that way rather than hoping something new emerges from the fractured fringe left.

Add up the all the oil burned in extracting that wood, chipping it, getting it to the coast and putting it on a big freighter and you're very much not carbon neutral. Not even close.

The only way biomass can be carbon neutral is if you chop the tree down with an axe and drag it to your boiler. The moment you start using hydrocarbons you're carbon negative. Better than burning the hydrocarbons, but by no means neutral. Not even close.

null,false,Jorvic,null,null,null,"I think that the SNPs offer wasn't fundamentally different tells you a hell of a lot about the reason we've got to this point.  A year well in advance of the referendum I was telling anyone that would listen (or who was stuck with me in the pub) that Miliband had made the choice between Scotland and the south east of England and as such Labour would be wiped out in Scotland, and the referendum closer than people expected at that time.  It's all down to the overall vision being offered, a confident Northern European Social Democratic future, which even Scottish business could get behind. Labour's been captured by this depressing fearful narrative the Conservatives peddle, and as such can only off piecemeal chicken feed measures (""the rail franchise system is broken? OK we'll keep it but have a state bidder, sorry we can't do more"") which turn off our core vote and are never going to be arresting enough to capture swing voters. 

This is why Corbyn is doing so well, there are core policies there that the majority of the membership have been calling for years, and they're willing to ignore parts they're less inclined to because at least there's confidence, conviction and a vision for the future.  The other candidates are bland, they use the same formulaic politicians answers people are sick of, and they're non-committal, Burnham said he thinks ""there should be more national involvement in transport"",  'more'? What does that mean. 

The big upset seems to be that Corbyn is 'unelectable', well with the other three we've just had the evidence they aren't either, Labour handwringing and tacit acceptance of Tory narratives (constantly going on about Osborne traps forcing their hand in votes, pathetic, that isn't politics) we look weak and that's why we'll struggle to win. 

I'm an avowed socialist. But the party can chose wherever it wants to be on the political spectrum as long as it has a strong distinctive narrative to the Conservatives.  As it is the only person really going hammer and tong on that is Corbyn,  rather than belittle the membership for being attracted to that, maybe the other wings should start to imitate it.  (There won't be a split if we get a proper policy debate, and a settlement most of us can agree on).

(I can go into detail if you want but I'm sure you've heard it all before).

From what I can see, the EU railway policy is incredibly complicated. Germany seem to have plans to privatise the railways at some point, but Deutsche Bahn is currently owned by the German Government, and they have postponed the IPO. Deutsche Bahn also own Arriva, who have some contracts for bus and train services in the UK, so part of our public transport system is effectively owned by the German Government. Meanwhile, France seems to have a nationalised system with a lot of companies being owned by SNCF, including (partly) Eurostar, which we're now losing our share in as our government is selling it off. I think France and Germany would have quite a hard time telling the UK that it couldn't renationalise its railways given their situations, but I'm not an expert.

You're right, I wasn't really suggesting that we maintain active storage for thousands of years, the closest (semi-)serious proposal I've seen that comes close to that is to use religion, by asking (or creating) religions to adopt nuclear waste symbols as symbols of evil. The problem with the longevity of nuclear waste is eventually all active storage necessarily have to stop. You reach a point (maybe after 50, maybe a thousand years) where you say you've babysat it long enough and it's time to throw it in a hole and hope that if there is a problem with your hole, you're still around to fix it or someone else is smart enough to.

That number includes Sellafield. Sellafield was a *military* site and is one of the most contaminated sites on Earth. It's where the early science (and mistakes) were made.

The fact they bolted a turbine on to use the steam rather than just venting the heat is of no relevance to it's actual heritage or purpose.


That figure is *totally irrelevant* when considering the cost of decommissioning a modern, *civilian* power plant which has been built around a fuel-cycle optimised for power generation, not for breeding weapon-grade Plutonium (which is a filthy cycle that creates all the nasty actinides and long-lived by-products).

If you just want heat to make steam, you can do that with low-grade nuclear material that produces far fewer nasty by-products and gives you a reasonably clean site to decommission - no worse than many industrial chemical processes.

I think a lot of this comes from a misconception of how these government agencies work. IF you read the article it explains that they have purportedly obtained a document which shows that intelligence agencies recently had their rules changed to allow them to spy on MSPs. If you read the document they have, it explains that they use a system called the Wilson Doctrine when trying to obtain warrants to intercept communications of members of parliament, and essentially this document shows that European and devolved parliamentarians are excluded from it. If anything, what it shows is that there are rules in place that clearly govern how data like this is intercepted. We don't know whether other rules are in place that cover MSPs/MEPs - or whether the purpose/scope of this Wilson Doctrine simply doesn't apply to them. **At no point anywhere have they produced any evidence to suggest there was interception of communications involving MSPs**. They also go on to point out that half the intelligence agencies never recognized anyone outside of Westminster in this regard... in the same sense they might intercept communications from say a local Councillor. 

I've been saying this all along... if the UK government had wanted to use GCHQ/SIS to rig the independence referendum or bring down the SNP they wouldn't fuck around the fringes listening to their voicemails... they'd have done what they do which is go for the jugular; i.e. release information that would appear to implicate someone like Alex Salmond in a paedophile scandal. **BAM**. During the independence referendum when he was the big boy, that would have been the end of the SNP pretty much overnight.

It seems to be part of a mentality with Scottish separatists that still cannot understand why they didn't win their independence referendum. I think what hurts them the most is the idea that their fellow countrymen - in greater numbers - actually voted to stay with the UK. It's sort of a ""No True Scotsman"" situation... except more ""Scotsmen"" voted to stay in the union than voted to leave. If you go over to /r/scotland you'll see them coming up with all sorts of odd little fantasy explanations: MI5 rigged it, secretly everyone is pro-independence and just hasn't realized it, people were bullied by the UK state etc etc. God forbid, anyone actually wanted to stay in the UK.

If you took a pragmatic view of it, you could dump a good proportion of our ""nuclear waste"" in landfill or at sea with literally zero environmental impact - it would change the background radiation so minutely that you'd still get a bigger dose by sitting on a lump of granite in Cornwall - which millions of tourists do every year.

If we were sensible about it, we could clear the stuff that isn't really measurably dangerous (less radioactive than coal fly-ash for instance!) quite easily, leaving us with an even smaller quantity of the genuinely nasty stuff.

But we're so paranoid that ""anything that might have possibly come into contact with something else that might have been irradiated slightly"" gets classed as hazardous... which is silly.

No one is saying they'll disappear. They will simply come out of the rental market and reduce the overall availability of rental properties.

&gt;An owner occupier - number of rental properties (and renters)goes down, but number of owner occupied houses (and owner occupiers living in them) goes up by the same amount. No net change.

It doesn't work like that, as this assumes two things that aren't true: One, that renters are generally ready to move into their own owned house but can't because they're owned by the landlords (BTL properties in the market make up about 15% of properties at most), and that the number of potential tenants is fixed now, and will go down with each tenant buying.

[As we can see, the total number of people renting has been steadily increasing.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/house-prices/10663923/Rise-of-Generation-Rent-as-home-ownership-hits-25-year-low.html) Therefore reducing the stock of rental properties will act to push up prices. That's literally how market forces work. More people wanting to rent, coupled with fewer places to rent, means it becomes a sellers/landlords market. They can increase the prices, and tenants *will* pay.

The Yaya-Dinho pairing was extremely effective when Yaya was out there doing what only he can and having Dinho play a supporting role from behind, but it's not nearly as effective when Yaya's doing nothing but Dinho is still forced to clean up for him.

* Security Clearance - If the role involves access to sensitive documentation. Involves financial checks, intelligence checks, and criminal record checks. 
* Baseline - Basic stuff like references etc.

There is also a scheme for contractor vetting but it doesn't apply here.

Wisdom will be kept as cover, at least until Flanno comes back. Gomez will stay, as per BR's comments. Ilori I think should be ahead of Toure as 4th choice CB, I'd prefer to keep him, but if Rodgers doesn't agree then he should go to a lower league PL team.

Ibe and Markovic won't go on loan. They should both, in my opinion, be the first choice ""3"" in a 4-3-3 for League Cup and Europa League. Both of those in themselves could be 20-30 matches, not including anything in PL.

Can won't go as we don't have that many CMs, and again I'd imagine he'll be first choice with Allen or Lucas in League Cup and Europa League.

I'm a little uncertain about Origi.

ITV and C4 produce far more popular programming on almost every night, beating BBC regularly when they have two shows with a similar format up against each other.

The BBC is also seemingly incapable of running programming past 2am (other than just switching to BBC News) and most of the weekend shows are re-runs from the 80s/90s, with iPlayer also lagging behind other streaming services.


It is commendable that they often try to produce new and interesting content but the only areas they excel at this are with Dramas and Documentaries. Comedy and Entertainment has been woeful when compared with the competition and their own remarkable history.

The only popular mainstream BBC shows that immediately come to mind are Top Gear, Sherlock, Luther, Doctor Who, Great British Bakeoff, Masterchef, Strictly Come Dancing, The Voice and Eastenders (and maybe Holby City/Casualty). You could argue that they all only come under 3 or 4 different categories and they also count for only a small chunk of their yearly broadcasting schedule.

As I said, I'm not questioning their quality but I am questioning the value for the general public who are forced into paying for it.

Yes

&gt; What could it be?

To re-start and re-imagine the European superstate. Enter a triad arrangement with Germany and France to unite into one federated nation. Set a deadline of thirty to fifty years to establish complete political and fiscal union, as well as a common language, coherent military, and capable of funding and producing its own nuclear deterrent. This gives us a nation formed from three very wealthy countries with a total population of 210 million. The long lead-in time is required because this is the kind of thing you cannot rush. This European superstate should then slowly expand, but it is imperative that the growth and integration is well-managed and given sufficient time for people to adapt and for inequalities to even out.

A single nation can no longer 'go it alone'. The problems of the world are too large for one nation to address - so noone does.

Even though the PC cost about 4 times the price of my Amiga 1200 Nothing worked (at all), everything crashed, you couldn't get the apps that existed for the Amiga at the time, if there were equivalents they cost over 20X the amount (and would crash your system at random) - also sound stuttered and was jittery all the goddamn time - that NEVER happened on the Amiga.

Thankfully my windows inspired computer dark age finished in 2002 when I started running Linux which felt much more like the Amiga than windows ever did.

Basically after the death of the Amiga and with Microsoft's complete illegal monopoly established (mid 90's) innovation was wiped out of the computing industry, it took nearly 1/2 a decade to get back to anywhere near the level of Amiga apps in windows (although everything was far more expensive, sound still stuttered and everything still crashed)

How much better the computing world would be now if the Amiga had not died...

To prove the point look at the specs of the machine Amiga was working on as Commodore went bankrupt - about a decade ahead....

And the last pay rise for junior doctors came with the loss of accomodation and hospital food (It's really cheap when I stayed in a hospital with my father. Like leaving the place our costs doubled. We got two rooms and food for a very low price. I think it was something like 80 quid a week plus roughly 2 quid a meal. 

The reliance on locums is something the NHS needs to deal with since that's the big cost of the NHS (the staff cuts made by Jeremy mean that most departments cannot hire enough staff so are forced to rely on locums who come under emergency staff). 

Naturally? Simple solution. 

1. Either boost Newbie doctor's salaries. Or write off the student loans. You need doctors and you aren't going to keep the predatory hands of America and Australia (They pay less but cost of living is way cheaper and they offer perks. More holidays, less hours and you live in Australia rather than Sheffield). 

2. Hire the damn staff needed. 

Locums are meant to be a ""We have 4 doctors and 3 shifts a day. This means 21 shifts. Oh no! That's 20 shifts. Do we hire a WHOLE EXTRA DOCTOR. Fuck no! We get a locum. 

That's sensible. That's sane. Using locums to cover for sick staff, staff on holidays, staff on maternity and while you recruit more permanent staff is ""Okay"" that's the purpose of it. Not for shoring up failures of staffing.

So you are accepting the fact that players can walk on to the team. Good, because saying ""Nobody walks on to the team, that shit doesn't fly"" was wrong.

&gt; And are you suggesting that they didn't train with the team and prove that they had the ability to be a starter?

I didn't suggest anything. You said no one walks on to the team, I just listed over half our starting lineup who did. And it was a mixture of young and old, veterans and younger.

De Bruyne for example was just as talented and experienced (or even more really) as Oscar when he came into the Chelsea squad. The only difference being that when Oscar came we had almost no depth in attacking midfield, hence him easily walking into the team. De Bruyne didn't have that luxury, mostly for just unlucky timing.

No, as you say, that £50bn is sunk one way or another.

Given that we require nGW of generating capability, and given that xGW of nuclear and coal will go off-line over the next y-years, we have a choice - do we build out:

* *Lots* of wind (and still risk having the lights go out because of their shitty 24% power factor), or

* Build coal and CCGT plants and be beholden to overseas fuel prices, or,

* Do we build modern nuclear?

The cost of cleaning up Sellafield has literally no bearing on what form of power generation we invest in for the future. They're two different expenses.

You seem to be saying ""we can't build new nuclear because we're still cleaning up old nuclear"", which is ridiculous because we're going to be building *something*, whether Coal, CCGT, Nuclear or Renewable - and the cost of GW-scale production runs to billions regardless of which tech you pick.

null,false,LukeeT,null,null,null,"I'm fairly decent but still loads better than me at this, my rules:  

*  Base the player transfer on the next five games rather than just their next fixture. Evertons first 5 games feature 4 top 7 teams i think. Most big teams surprisingly play each other early, Chelsea away at City is annoying in week 2, Arsenal probably have the best start.
* Take this first 8 games seriously, DONT transfer in defenders that score in the opening games, thats not sustainable points. For instance, Dier was transferred in by many clueless people and he **die**r**d** off quickly.
* If you watch a lot of matches and MOTD you really will have a better chance of winning your leagues as youre more likely to notice the players playing well but not getting the points yet.
* For Goalkeepers - look towards the likes of West Ham, Swansea, Everton, Southampton, Crystal Palace, Stoke and whatever team Pulis has that season. Spend as little as possible on GK, i don't even have a sub GK that plays to save money. I dont want another decent GK sitting it out, chances are you swap them when one has bottom of the league and the other has City, then the clean sheet goes the way you dont expect it. So just have one good goalie.
* Defenders - I often go very cheap here and always play 3 at the back, simply again because its a little tricky to predict clean sheets. My rule is normally 1 proven goalscoring defender (Terry, Ivanovic, Coleman) tops, the rest have from the clubs i mentioned above. Look for big club loanees in smaller clubs as the often perform better. Put in big CBs for those corner goals or wingbacks that have Gomis/Carroll/Giroud to aim at. Ill have one relegation shitter on the bench that stays there until a 3.9m defender comes available when i have a spare transfer to use.
* Midfielders - Im going Hazard and Sanchez at all costs. If you can get Arsenal midfielders all the better but be cautious of rotation. Mata could have a huge season with Man Utd only having one striker and 2 good DMs. Sterling after gauging whether hes a starter. There will be at least 3 or 4 surprise Midfielders that get 3 or 4 goals in the first 8 games or spells thorough the season - Chadli/Siggy/Ramsey/Eriksen/Oscar are previous culprits of having great spells in between 2pt games.
* Strikers - spend big on 2 at least a la Costa and Aguero/Rooney. If you can fit them in with Hazard and Sanchez you will pick up points every time everyone else does but not many will have all 4 in the same team. Rotate your captain between mid/strikers and look at opposition teams form and injuries. Consider who exactly they are being marked by and whether its a mismatch and try and have your captain play at home.
* Dont be afraid to have a punt - Ill be looking towards Ibe, Zaha, Rodriguez, some new signings from clubs etc.

null,false,pizzapiejaialai,1972crest,,null,"Just got back from the game, some of my thoughts.

Denayer looked strong, Humphreys was very unsure of himself throughout, but both were outclassed by Madrid's superior attacking force. 

I think Pellegrini did them both a world of good putting them up against Bale, CR7 and co. After Roma, a bunch of the EDS kids were dropping soundbites about how they hope to break in. This big game experience gives them a good dose of reality, and just how far away they are from the standard that City expects of our players.

Worrisome that Kolarov and Sagna weren't able to keep the goals out either. They constantly play as overlapping wingers in Pellegrini's 4-2-2-2 system that it almost seems they've forgotten how to defend.

Sterling is proving to be the buy of the transfer season so far. His little jinks and runs were tremendous, and Real sometimes had to put four players on him just to neutralise the threat.

Yaya started strong and then faded as the night wore on.

For me, standout of the night: Fernando. I know, I know, we've all given him quite a bit of shit for the last season. I'm not so sure now. After #DareToDemichelis, we know that Pellegrini has an almost obstinate confidence in a player if he sees something in the him.

I think giving Fern so much game time over preseason is perhaps starting to pay off. He looked sharp, made a few good tackles that prevented some through balls, and generally held the ball well. Worked hard this game as well.

I'm not entirely worried by this game. As mentioned, in the grand scheme of titles, it was a meaningless match. Annoyed to see Delph get injured, pleased that Dzeko got a run out, as it might be his last match for City.

For what it is, cannabis is terribly expensive.  The black market isn't very efficient at production - small scale, high wages due to perceived risk etc.  But illegal growers are still making a tonne of cash from it.  Like, you could have  a 150cm x 150cm growing area and make enough to pay your mortgage.  It's insane.

  Cannabis is currently about 20-30X more expensive /g than tobacco (that's fully-taxed UK tobacco, which is about £10 /25g rolling tobacco, compared to street prices of about £10 /g for cannabis).  They're both plants.  And whilst there's a little more work in harvesting cannabis compare to tobacco, and whilst the market might be smaller, you can see there's plenty of room for efficiencies to made if there were licensed, large-scale, legal growers.  And then there's still plenty of room for tax revenue to be added on before we're even getting towards black market prices.

And then there are the benefits of buying legally.  a) You know what you're getting (re strength), b) you don't have to deal with annoying/shady dealers (""why don't you stay for a spliff, blood?"" ""no really, I don't smoke that much I just want to go...why do we have to be friends!?!"").  

Honestly, I'd pay a little more just to avoid that whole shitty interaction where you have to pretend to be a fucking drop out gangster / cool customer / bro and stay and get stoned and play gears of war in his shitty chav hovel when really you just wanted to go to the park and read a book or something.

I would have thought its unique funding source would inoculate it against the terrible lack of ethics gallivanting through the rest of the media companies that are privately funded, but it hasn't. I am struggling to see why the British public should continue to pay for an organisation to pursue agendas instead of the news with its most critical function. Its not just about the other programs their news reporting lacks basic integrity and the necessary research to be called anything but fiction on a regular basis.

So for the first time in my life I think the BBC licence fee ought to be abolished, because its not just politics or others campaigning for it to die, I know its news articles are regularly untrue to push particular agendas and narratives that have no actual basis in the real world and I don't think that is in the public interest to fund that at all.",null,0,null,1437746579,null,0,false,0,cteka1g,null,t3_3ef8pi,null,t1_cteka1g,null,t3_3ef8pi,null,null,null,1440057893,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

If you're betting on football then you'll find nearly all bookies will have pre-designed bet slips that include a list of all upcoming matches and their odds. You just complete the slip and walk to the counter and pay.

If you want to bet on a specific horse then you might want to just grab one of the blank slips and write the name and time of the race, the horse and how much your stake is. You will then be given odds by the bookmaker when you hand him the slip and pay the money.

Just some advice; bring your ID. Even if you're 21 they're likely to ID you the minute you walk through the door. 

Also I would avoid anything simulated. I find it crazy that so many people think it's fun to stick money on a simulated horse race. 

Lastly; if you want to place a bet then I would avoid the bookies, it's so easy to do it online these days. Get the William Hill app, it's the easiest to use and they've always got good offers on. Bookies aren't really the nicest places in the world to spend time, I use my phone 9/10 for any betting and only really go in them if I'm with a friend who wants to place a bet.",null,0,null,1437746617,null,0,false,0,ctekasy,null,t3_3eg1ds,null,t1_ctekasy,null,t3_3eg1ds,null,null,null,1440057903,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I'm not sure myself, before UKIP who were the fringe right? Was there even one? Tory back benches? Possibly just because the dissaffected right was chiefly over one issue (Europe), where as the disaffected left was filling space abandoned by Labour while pushing thier own agenda of which there were many in the somewhat idealistic left.


&gt;I disagree that all those parties are ""left"" in the traditional sense, they may have some left policies but SNP and Plaid are nationalist and the lib dems are far too centrist to be classified as left.

I certainly think the nat parties are left, it might not be their raison d'etre, but as their respective countries swing left of the UK establishment it was always going to have a lefty influence ""let us go out own way to do our own thing (which will be a lefty thing)"". Imagine Scotland leaned centre right do you think the SNP would be where they are now? ""Let us go out own way to do our own thing (which will be much the same as your thing)""

As for the lib dems you're right they fit into the centrist problem to a large extent. Where they don't is the authoritarian/liberal spectrum which is another area I feel we need debate which isn't currently voiced by the status quo double team. (personally I think this is actually more important but coalition politics put paid to that for a while.)

&gt;I think Corbyn could be an interesting leader he would certainly shift the debate in a different direction and he clearly has grass roots support but I do think that the lurch to the grass roots will land the party back in Kinnock territory and hence unelectable.

I'm just keen that we have that national debate, I think even if the left loses and it turns out we've politically landed in the right place, the country will be better for the discussion. Engaging more people would be a good thing it may pull together some of the left (i think we're unlikely to see snp and the greens disappear but they may feel they can work more closely with a left oriented labour) creating a more solid voice against the right. And we may see many politically disengaged folks more interested which could offset losses in the centre. Or not I dunno I think they should try though.

People say ""Labour haven't won with anyone not called Tony Blair in two generations"" but they also haven't tried to win with anyone much left of him in over a generation either and still haven't won for the last ten years.

At Marseille he did ""make the grade"" ... sort of. There was a lot of competition for places and so he ended up coming off the bench a lot, and/or playing on the wing rather than through the middle where he perhaps prefers to be (and is arguably most effective). He left after some kind of disagreement IIRC. Bit of a red flag there, perhaps.

At Lorient he's done well IMO. But probably wants to move on because they're ... kind of shit. He was involved in about a third of their league goals last season though, if that's any indicator.

In his time at Marseille I think he just wasn't ready yet, and then he was always in competition with some really strong players, so it was hard for him to really establish himself in the team (he would argue he wasn't give enough of a chance to).

Also have to remember he's still young, so that wouldn't have helped. On the plus side, I reckon he has another 3-4 years of development ahead of him (he's 24 at the start of the season).

Yeah the fee might be a slight overpayment, but could be well worth it down the line. Depends on how Sherwood wants to use him, really. But he's good enough. Main concern I would have is that he's kind of hot-headed. If he can keep his cool, we're alright, I reckon.

I think worst case scenario we're paying a couple million too much for an average forward. And while I think he could get us 15 goals....

&gt; He came very early to Hoffenheim. Not many people knew him yet, he was from a second division club in Brazil, he was a kid but he developed very well, very solid, he is not typical Brazilian player. Imagine he's obviously fast, very strong, he can score and ______ (i think he speaks german at this point lol) his concentration, he shows that he is special player, interest was not just from Liverpool, it was from big clubs all over the world. So I think going to Liverpool was hopefully the right choice (wind is starting to piss me off)

&gt;why it was teh right choice?

&gt;Well the other teams who were also in the draw for him, look for example ManCity, so many top class players and a very big squad. I think BR is the right guy to work with him, he is always successful with younger players and (can't hear anything from here on) ______ just step _______ I believe ______ more interest ______ can became the same star as he was in Germany.

&gt;What kind of person he is?

&gt;The Brazilian guys coming from Brazil to Europe are always a risk. Different country, different language, different weather but Roberto has now 4 years in Germany so he learned the language he knows the european way of life. Its not such a big culture shock from Germany to England. The language is also not so different. At the end of the day he will adjust very fast. He already said that he is really enjoying it there and I can see him being a big fan favorite.

I suspect you could get the crown estate proper.

I'm a monarchist personaly but if I was tasked with ending I would do so by not actually doing so.

Parliament had the power to deem a monarch illegitimate. The sovrieghn is who they say it is. They also control sucession laws.

So if I wanted to end it I'd just make the sucession laws into what ever we would be using to elect the head of state. Basically make queen an elected position. Probably title it lord protector or whatever.

This would get you the crown estate proper and the royal dutchies provided parliament also selected an heir. 

I suspect the dutchies would be placed under the crown estate in this scenario.

Sandringham and Balmoral are held by the Windsor family not the royal family. They are the same people right now but if the Windsors were to be deposed apropriating these two palaces would be seizing a private citizens house, every kind of illegal.

The whole point of liberalism is that we fight for everyone's freedoms. Especially those of people we don't like to do things we find unsavoury, it doesn't realy count if your pro that thing anyway.

That isn't the same as being a progressive although the two have a tendency to share goals the reasoning is verry diferent. 

A progressive want equal marrige because they see that as the just and moral thing to do.

A liberal wants it legal because it doesn't impede anyone els's freedom. The moral aspect isn't relevant.

 First of all I would recommend betting online or over the phone. Set yourself a daily or weekly limit. Their system will ensure that you don't exceed it.

Online you have a great mix of options of a ridiculous number of sports, a massive number of those in play. You also get certain added benefits such as event streaming when you've placed a bet on a match.

Also feel free to call, email or chat with their advisors online. They have lots of knowledge about betting and every sport. If you have any questions or queries about anything at all, they can help. (I'd call, they guys on chat will be talking to multiple people and are always encouraged to use canned responses. They're not always perfect and are under a lot of pressure.)

All bookmakers nowadays have a great number of offers etc both to rope in new customers and also to reward existing customers. 

Bookmakers all have to abide by very strict regulations in terms of gambling addiction. It is for this reason that I would always talk up bet365, they had a great team that genuinely helped a lot of people if things got out of hand. 

Be careful, don't be daft. Set limits. But, more than anything, have fun.

Later on made a tackle after another Skrtel mistake but also failed to put 4 headers on target. 5/10 can't be blamed for the loss.

Ibe - Produced a moment of magic that we will need against buses. Took the game into his own hands whenever he could. Had a lt of failed dribbles though and some poor passes/crosses. 6.5/10

Skrtel - Didn't see him do much. Still rusty. 5/10

Bogdan - Made a couple saves to help us get the draw, tested but not too much. 6/10

Clyne - Made a couple of mistakes and had a couple poor crosses. Also made a lot of tackles, a few further up that stopped counter attacks. 5.5/10

Moreno - Tracked back nicely and barely made any mistakes defensively. Played a bit too cautiously at times by passing when he could have dribbled more but also tried at times to get in behind defenders. 6/10

Milner - Tried to link up with Henderson and Lallana but was always one pass away from breaking apart the defense. Had good chance at goal but hit it straight at the keeper. 5.5/10

Henderson - Tried to control the game but a few of his final passes/flicks were intercepted so he was unable to find his man. 5.5/10

Origi - At times was too static and at times made amazing runs. Looked isolated upfront and was always just too short for some of our crosses. 5.5/10

Lallana - can dribble his way out of a prison. Opened up space very nicely with his movement but there were two times he could have either passed to Moreno or Origi (in better positions) but opted to test the keeper and shoot. 6/10",null,0,null,1437750210,null,0,1437750719,0,ctemh7d,null,t3_3eg8gk,null,t1_ctemh7d,null,t1_ctem9bq,null,null,null,1440058930,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

You're right about technology, but it's not just driverless cars and 3D printing. Like, I'm a writer, and there are already computer programs that can write the news. A sufficiently sophisticated computer could do a lot of the kind of work I do, but where it takes me a day to write 4,000 words, it will take a computer less than a second. Once those programs and the processors that run them are cheap enough, my livelihood will go up in smoke, and there's really very little anyone can do to stop it.

After that, the rest of your £500 spare each month can go into your savings account for the house deposit.

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"I think they already have been economised to some extent. I seem to recall 5 years ago Cameron started walking/cycling places, and significantly cut the number of ministerial cars available.

Fundamentally though, these are high-ranking government ministers - they have places to be. For instance, it may seem silly to take a car 0.7miles, but actually if Bercow had an onward trip afterwards for which he needed a car, then whether he is driven 0.7miles, or whether he walks and the car drives 0.7miles to pick him up for his onward journey is neither here nor there, it's the papers picking one finance line out of context and presenting it as wasteful. There may have been a travel manifest presented to the expenses office, who approved it based on the *full facts*, but only jotted down a brief description in the actual expenses record.

There are also security implications to consider with senior politicians - the whole thing with Cameron cycling to work with his security detail driving behind in a car was one such example and as Speaker, Bercow will be in a similar security category to Cabinet Ministers, so they're always going to make sure he has his police officer around, and probably a vehicle not too far away.

I'm not sure the provisions are especially ""lavish"". Yes, they're going to be decent cars - comfortable mid-range Jags or similar, because they're potentially also going to be ferrying foreign dignitaries, trade emissaries to the Foreign Office, etc and so they want to do the whole diplomatic thing and impress with the best of British.

By contrast though, they're not exactly tooling around in Rolls Royces or Bentleys like some dictators or more corrupt regimes do. Have you seen the multi-million dollar limos Obama (and the entire First Family) gets carried around in, fully armoured luxury vehicles that fly around with him in military transports? Or consider the Police motorcades that accompany a lot of government figures overseas. The UK Gov is pretty economical by comparison, providing just the senior ministers with mid-level executive cars.

I imagine they will have a fairly standard fleet-hire contract where they get cars in with a service deal and cycle them out after 3 years, so they always have a newish, smart looking fleet.",null,0,null,1437752107,null,0,1437754047,0,ctenpyf,null,t3_3effvp,null,t1_ctenpyf,null,t1_cteljz2,null,null,null,1440059515,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Ilori is a strange one, I remember before pre-season started it had seemed like him and Gomez were going to be competing and whoever performed better would stay at the club and the other one would be sent on loan: strangely he hasn't featured and hasn't been spotted training although Can is back from the U-21 world cup.

My contention with the idea that a young quality centre-back can't be given game time due to the fact that they are liable for costly mistakes isn't that Gomez or Ilori wouldn't be prone to making these mistakes, it's that our starting centre halves, especially Lovren, to a lesser extent Skrtel, and to a lesser extent again Sakho are all prone to making mistakes and losing concentration.

This obsession with winning, even if it means giving into the demands of media barons, billionaires and corporate lobbyists has made Labour a toxic force in Scotland and the only reason I haven't dump them is because there isn't an alternative in England.

Never mind what Cameron *says* he wants. First law of politics (or common sense) must be to take that with a pinch of salt. If you think the people in the security service advising him don't understand the impossibility of what he purports to be in favour of, you're in cloud cuckoo land. 

What, pragmatically, *can* he achieve? With a suitably-managed campaign of media management, and a few (probably inevitable) terrorist or kiddie-fiddling outrages which weren't thwarted in time, he can make it *seem* morally reprehensible to advocate using tech which the establishment can't crack. 

He *knows* full well he can't crack crypto being used by foreign governments and technologically-astute terrorists. So why wage war on cryptography?

As far as I can see the only conceivable answer, other than an ineffective form of populism, would be the expediency of spying on your own electorate, some of which - like most people - I'd probably be in favour of, if it were restricted to nicking thieves, fraudsters, child abusers, people posting unauthorised pics of their exes and so on. 

But to do this - as the Snowdon revelations have shown - they cast a very wide net indeed. So wide that *everything* you or I do online is caught in it, even if it doesn't happen to be picked out of the net and examined by our analogy-straining fisherman. 

Which takes us back to the question, raised I believe by ol' balloon-face himself: should there be a place where communication can happen, unreachable by the authorities?

Before answering that question, we should understand that ""the authorities"", of necessity, include *all future authorities*, with whatever agendas they may have, and whatever level of democratic oversight they may (or may not) have.

If you have absolute faith that the establishment of this country will never, ever abuse an ability to examine all online or telephonic communication, then of course it's absolutely fine. 

Don't forget, of course, that a lot of archiving goes on to make this possible.

How do you know that none of the players that walked on to the team would have felt the same way? How do you know Hazard wouldn't have left if he was benched immediately like De Bruyne, or Fabregas, or Courtois (who really was considering leaving if Cech was number 1 this season), or Fabregas who undoubtedly was expecting a starting role at Chelsea after being unhappy at Barca. Any of these players could have done what De Bruyne did and left if they felt that they were being unfairly benched and having no game time. We would never know though seeing as how they walked on the team.

You both need to know what the other expects from the shared payments, deposit etc and ensure that you come to an agreement. You are about to take on a lot of debt together and it can be a stumbling block if you haven't communicated how this will be handled. Talk about if one of you lost you job, if you died, became severely ill. Money can be a killer to the best of relationships, and adds stress to most anyway, so make sure you are communicating what you want! 

You'll have a choice in the contract on how the property in shared, joint tenants or tenants in common. The difference being that in the event of the death of one of the parties, joint tenants would receive their share of the property, whereas with tenants in common it will go to the deceased's estate. We opted for the latter, as although we intend to get married one day, if things don't work out prior to that it is legally easier to separate our finances.

If one of you is contributing more to the deposit, or solely paying the mortgage, your solicitor can draw up a ""deed of trust"" that will cover the amount from any proceeds of a sale of the property.

Also make a budget (good for mortgage application anyway), and make it fair. We got a joint account and put in an equal monthly payment for mortgage/food/bills etc which makes life a lot easier. 

Also, have an emergency fund before you buy. It will not only help with getting a mortgage, but will also cover you both if something goes wrong with the house. I was surprised how little depth a building survey goes to (and we paid for the most thorough version), and have found a few problems that weren't even mentioned and require immediate attention (leaking pipes, drip in chimney) although admittedly we got an older property.

Are you saying that most highly trained professionals: lawyers, architects, bankers etc (or anyone else who's on even a fairly decent wage), would opt-in to give up 1440 hours (60 full days) a year of their free time to be ready at a moment's notice, any time of day; to have full responsibility and accountability; stay near the hospital; no going out; no alcohol; no concrete plans; for an extra £2200, after tax, *a year*???

Would you opt in to do that with any of those jobs? Or most jobs if that money wasn't going to make a huge difference to you?

The reason nearly all consultants do it is because they don't want to let their colleagues and their patients down, and they have a sense of professional responsibility. At the end of the day they could opt out and spend that time as a locum consultant earning £100 an hour, not £2.50.

The main issue here is Jeremy Hunt's attitude that they're all lazy, work shy people who aren't professional - when the NHS would literally fall apart without this kind of caring and goodwill from all of its staff.

***

**Edit:** ...and by the way, most people in the NHS, including the BMA, are in favour of there being a 7 day full system. The problem everyone has is Hunt's insistence on pretending that changing consultant working hours would achieve this. It wouldn't - they're already working.

Being in a situation so closely related to the OP and reading the comments posted here have given me a boost in my search for a job.
  
It's the most gut wrenching thing having to see your SO work all hours of the day to continue to provide the roof over our heads while the SO sees you ""sat on your are all day"" making myself feel so worthless. I'm currently having sessions with a therapist for PTSD and depression and still in that daily rut.
  
But as I said, having 2 years unaccounted for is such a big red flag especially for someone with the qualifications and experience for the job I'm applying for and still hearing nothing eats away everyday and with more brown letters hitting our doorstep everyday it feels like the whole world is against me.
  
The only time I can ""get away from it all"" is in my games on an evening and that only compounds the issue with the SO as I absolutely hate soaps. It's only fair she watches her soaps after a hard days work as much as I can spend my time after applying for multiple jobs everyday.
  
It's a dire situation and having chased up Combat stress for help and RBL and getting nowhere, just feels like after spending time in the desert, the system is failing us. Child/working tax being reduced, not eligible for ESA, PIP or income support, no housing benefit etc is forcing us deeper into the shithole.

The battle for the left movement has been going on and reinventing itself for *decades* but it's never caught on. Even within the party itself there is resistance as we're seeing. It's also not just because those  who follow that more moderate path are worried about elections, although they (and I) do believe they're better placed to do so, but because they genuinely believe social progress can be made in conjunction with free-markets and competitive tax rates. 

Look at what the Blairates did: Minimum wage, much much more spending on the NHS and Educations, The tax credits we're all worried about now, forgave third world debt, free museum entry and a few more targeted benefits such as EMA that gave support to people who needed it. They did things we all disagree with too but that was a progressive Government and got more Labour policy passed than any other Labour government since 1945.

You say there is an obsession with winning but that's because that's how you can get things done. If you want a progressive voice to shift the centre to the left and are less concerned with winning an election then join a pressure group, there is value in that, but Labour should be aiming to be the Government.

I consider it to be a very clean city, with relatively low crime and homelessness. People are happy to help you if you ask them on the street, and you'll quickly make friends on a night out.

The seaside and low average age in the city make for a really carefree and fun atmosphere over the summer. During the winter, people tend to withdraw a lot more, but I think that's the same everywhere to be honest.

Of course, I can only speak anecdotaly, however you can check up crime and such near where you'll be living to see what areas to avoid. Please note that Guildhall walk has a higher rate of crime due to it being one of the most popular streets in the city. I would say in proportion it's more safe than other places (Normally has about 3-4 police vans there on the weekends to make sure everyone is okay etc). Here's the link: https://www.police.uk/hampshire/5PC01/

I cycle to UCL everyday. It's about 6-7 miles each way for me which is pretty simple, you probably won't be cycling much more than that unless you are living in the outer zones of the tube map (zones are a decent metric for distance). Takes me about 35-40 mins. 

If you are confident on the road then london isn't too bad. It gets a bit busy around Euston but there are several ways to avoid it with a lot of shortcuts. It's also pretty flat in central London. However the cycle lanes are in no way up to Danish/Dutch standards. You will be essentially cycling on the road. There are varying levels of cycle lanes, most of which are just painted sections beside the curb. There are exclusive bus lanes which are usable by black cabs and cyclists too, so this helps in the more busier areas. A lot of bike lanes go off the road and into a pavement - you are not obligated to use these, they don't tend to help with speed (in my opinion). I usually just tend to stay on the road. 

Weather wise the worst you are gonna get is rain. In winter you won't freeze if you have some decent bike clothing. 

Storage... I'm lucky that I can fit my bike in my house, I'm sure unless you live in a bedsit you will be able to keep it somewhere. On campus I can lock up in a secluded part of my department. I'm sure these are quite common across all departments, as long as you lock up in the inner sections of the campus.

About two years later they start sending me reams of letters, alternatingly addressed to either me by name or ""the legal occupier"". Because I don't watch tv, or have any kit to watch tv on, and had allready told them this (and also because I'm a little bit lazy) I just binned the letters.

This strategy worked perfectly well - right up until I had three court baliffs in two vans show up at my flat in order to collect goods to satisfy the £500 fine I'd been issued for watching telly without a licence. Even though I hadn't been - and couldn't have even if I'd wanted to - the fact that I'd not renewed the declaration was enough for the judge to issue the fine, and of course once the heavies are knocking on the door the point where you can protest innocence has long since passed.

Is Lamela a failure?  Hell no.  He's 23, there is no doubt his progressing steadily and he even in poor form he's still always got this capability for brilliance.  I think this could be an important season for him as it seems like he is a clear attacking starter (or at least, we haven't bought anyone nor have we been linked to anyone that would be a direct replacement for him).

In terms of our club strategy, especially in early ENIC days and under 'Arry and AVB and when we bought Lamela, total failure.  They paid £30m for a player that scored 15 goals in a season at Roma.  Injury or not, he hasn't delivered on that.  If you buy a car to drive to work in tomorrow and it doesn't run, it's a failure.  If you buy a kit to build a car, and you want to get it up and running in a year or two, it can't be considered a failure when it isn't ready tomorrow.

This article makes the point that the club strategy has done a 180 and we look to be taking the long view on everything.  If you view Lamela in the context of a promising 23 year old, then the current strategy would suggest he's the most exciting player in the squad.

To make it short: The creators made their own version of the legend, though the most important things have stayed the same. Why does it matter what skin color characters have, like that does not make any difference. Also, part of the reason why Guinevere would usually be described as ""pale, not a lot of sunlight"" is due to the fact that royalty did not go outside, they did not have to because they had their people doing work outside and they themselves stayed inside their big castle all day long wherefore wealthy and royal people back in the day had lighter skin than others. Aside from that, it does not have any influence on the character herself. Like I said, almost everything is different, it's a retelling and a really good one.

If you can identify the individuals responsible for specific crimes that were codified before the events took place, and find a court which has the authority to judge them, then I would agree that those individuals should be brought to trial.

Then supermarkets started doing something odd. They started *insisting* that even if you had your own bag, they would put your purchases into one of their plastic bags **first**. Why? So that when you left the store the store detectives knew you hadn't stolen the goods. They would even stick a plastic bag to the side of a TV if you bought one just to indicate it was paid for.

After a while of that people stopped bothering to bring shopping bags. You had to have a plastic bag anyway so why bother? And you certainly didn't bring an old supermarket bag with you. Putting goods into a used bag would look incredibly suspicious.

Then we got the plastic bag environmental panic. But for some reason we were told that *consumers* needed to be educated - not *supermarkets*. Suddenly shopping bags were back in fashion - but now they were called ""bags for life"", and you were expected to reuse the plastic bags. And now, due to the supposed wanton behaviour of the consumer (!) we will be charged 5p for the privilege of a cheap nasty plastic bag. No wonder use practically falls to zero when it is introduced.

When we defend deep, Skrtel does very well, but when we play a high line, which Rodgers often does considering the system we play, Skrtel is always  caught playing too deep which is why those tackles have to come in.

It's about high time we realized that our defence should not be centered around Skrtel and he is prone to making errors, regardless of how much this sub likes him. Sakho is by far the better defender and our defence should be centered around him, with one of Lovren or Skrtel next to him, though I'd much rather have Illori join the party and show us what he's got.

London is the best example.  It was a village, the Romans moved in and built a fortified city after they drove off the original inhabitants but they adapted their name for their settlement.

That is the reality of the UK today.

People talk about the damage that Margaret Thatcher did, but it was her abuse of the the UK's centralised government, developing policies which applied directly to places she had no political mandate over like Scotland and Wales, without the consultation or wishes of the people there which did the most damage. If there's one person who made the case for devolution, it was her. In fact if there's a single person that made the case for *Scottish Independence*, it was her. I certainly don't think Welsh devolution would have happen had she not been elected, and even Scottish devolution was about 50/50 before her election.

* November 2005: YouTube officially launches

* November 2006: Google buys YouTube

* October 2007: Hulu begins beta testing

* **December 2007: BBC iPlayer official launch, begins streaming using Flash**

* January 2008: Netflix begins unlimited streaming as a bonus to its DVD product

* March 2008: Hulu official launch

* December 2008: ITV Player launches

* September 2009: ITV Player begins using Flash

* July 2011: Netflix separates its DVD and streaming markets

I can't remember ever seeing something like that, it probably exists.

It'll vary greatly by crime though. Things like house break-ins will be highly reported as homeowners need police reports for their insurance, so they'll apply direct pressure on any reluctant police to follow through with the basics. But it'll be the opposite with say vandalizing of a car where you don't want your insurance company to know as you don't intend claiming due to losing your no claims and the ""excess"" payment. 

Statutory rape is probably one of the worst at all. The victim might not want to report it and most seem to come from care/foster homes where they don't have anyone looking out for them.

null,false,the_ultravixens,null,null,null,"There's another variant on this that I heard from Joseph Heath, who's a Canadian philosopher.

He had a class of about 80 students, and one day he brought them in and told them that he had marked one of their tests too harshly.  He then told them that the eachy had the chance to either increase their own individual mark by 5%, or to bump up the grades of everyone bar themselves by 1%.

Wales just has the English ITV service, with something like 4 hours a week of actual television made in Wales. and of course they're always trying to duck out of producing as little regional stuff as possible.

If there is one part of broadcasting that should be devolved, it's the ITV franchise and S4C, it *literally* makes no sense to have them both controlled by Westminster when Scotland and Northern Ireland get their own Independent Television channels and S4C is a dedicated Welsh language channel.

One of the weird things about Independent Television was that Wales was never actually given it's own ITV channel, [the franchise area was always either combined with either the West Coast of the England (HTV) or a short lived Welsh Language ITV region which broadcast along the west coast of Wales (TWW)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Independent_Television_ITV_regional_map_1962-1964.png), there was never a ""Welsh Television"" like there's a ""Scottish Television"". 

Although they have split the franchise area now so [Wales has it's own ITV region](http://ukfree.tv/styles/images/2013/itv%20zones.png), it obviously doesn't mean fuck all if it just keeps being handed back to the god awful ITV Plc company. Let the Welsh Government be the one's that decide who runs it, please.

The Romans (coming from Rome obv.) knew how big a city could be and built Londinium with that it in mind. I think its incorrect to attribute the founding of a city to the small basic settlement instead of the advanced town that was built on top of it. This is the case for many places around the world.

In the case of Calcutta, it is very much a British city, Im not even aware of any prior Bengali settlement. Even if that was the case it was obvious realtively insignificant.

As far as FSG, I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt for now.  Until these last four years or so, their handling of the Sox was about as good as could be hoped for, with the wheels not really coming off until the end of the Epstein/Francona run.  Since then, things have been going poorly, and they've made some really baffling decisions, but I can kind of see what they're trying to do — maintain a competitive team without sacrificing organizational stability or their depth in prospects.  They're failing wildly at the competitive part (although not for lack of trying — big money contracts to Sandoval and Ramirez haven't quite panned out the way they expected, though their pitching strategy for this season was questionable, even if it was coherent).  And I'm not entirely sure that a little instability would be worse than another year of John Farrell managing, even if the farm system has some stunning prospects and some of the players to come out of it recently are really exciting.

From what I can see, I think they're kind of aiming at some of the same things at Liverpool, though I think they're doing things better with LFC than they have with the Sox.  Despite his flaws, Rodgers strikes me as a more talented manager than Farrell ever has been and is perhaps more worth committing to.  And, even with the abjectly horrible finish to last season, Liverpool is far more competitive than the Sox have been over the same period, 2013 Series notwithstanding (which seems fluky in retrospect).  I can't speak with any confidence about the young players at LFC, as I'm not entirely familiar with the quality of the U21s or rest of the academy outside of what I read here and elsewhere online, and a good chunk of the young players that have come in recently to the first team haven't seemed to pan out (thinking of Luis Alberto, Ilori, and Manquillo, in particular).  I suppose this is the problem with focusing so heavily on young players in any sport — if you get the right players, you look like geniuses, but it's kind of easy to look like idiots, too.

The innovation was not about writing better code. The innovation was for a major producer of high-quality content to make all its material available for download or streaming *by default*. No commercial broadcaster had the guts to do that.

I used RealPlayer for many years and while it *could* stream content after a fashion, [it didn't have much content](http://superpass.real.com/) besides 24-hour news channels and music, and it was hopelessly overpriced. They saw streaming as a way of promoting shows that you'd then watch on conventional TV and as a niche product for e.g. expats.

It reminds me of [Benedict Evans' comments](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/2/28/market-size) on the difference between the way Cellnet and Orange saw the mobile phone market (if you follow the link, scroll down to the videos).

That way these out of work intelligent guys and girls could determine whether our MPs were entitled to their claims and where they could even be paid out of some of the money that they save the taxpayer - creating new jobs in process that were definitely needed it appears. If it was found that it was over what you and the guy on the Clapham omnibus could get, don't pay it. That way they would soon start to use the taxpayer's money wisely, but not before. 

A simple system but I know now because the system is so corrupt it would never happen, as the system behind the scenes protects all the those with their mouths in the trough, even themselves.

I don't pay with my time by watching adverts. This in itself gives the BBC a competitive advantage. 

Having said that, what makes the BBC awesome is the way that it DOESN'T abuse that advantage but instead uses it to push better, more informative, content. Imagine if TV channels were paid a set rate per hour of content, equal across the channels, the standard commercial model would result in a drive to show the cheapest content 24/7 - giving most income for least expenditure. 

The BBC is instead paid to produce content and does so within a remit and governance structure which doesn't just deliver on the required baseline but instead drives innovation. 

That is why we have a mixed public service/ commercial model - the BBC sets the benchmark against which other channels have to compete which makes them better. That is also why commercial interests want rid of the BBC - it would release the market and enable a drive to lower cost production for them, and lower quality output for us. 

Without the BBC as a benchmark we would need to somehow govern quality across all channels and quality is hugely subjective so this would be a huge creativity-swamping quagmire.

And given how broad and contextual a question like 'Would you vote Yes or No to leave Europe', I'm not surprised he didn't say simply Yes or No.

It's 16% greater than the morbidity rate during the week. 

In effect, it's something like 0.2% of an increase, as if a 200% increase of 0.1 is only 0.2 deaths for example. A big increase on a small number can be misleading.

And that's before you consider (as many previously mentioned) that the types of condition of severity (eg emergencies) are usually on weekends. 

Furthermore, incidental findings are rife in academic medical research, it's why you include p-values / hypothesis testing. 
That figure, when you look at the clinically significant difference barely achieved a p value above 0.05, the accepted false positive rate in clinical medicine. 
So it almost failed to achieve any statistical significance at all and could just be chance. Thats before you even get into statistical significance does not = clinical significance.

Do not fill in any forms yet.

As you have not told HMRC within 28 days of becoming self employed you may have technically broken the rules

Ring the dedicated *[voluntary disclosure](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/voluntary-disclosure-helpline)* phone line on 0300 123 1078 and tell them when you set up your business.  They are extremely nice and helpful, and you only have identify yourself when you have come to a satisfactory arrangement.  Whatever arrangement you come to with the voluntary disclosure cannot be overridden by any other HMRC unit.

Don't worry about ringing them.  Newly self employed people who don't understand the self assessment rules are *extremely* common.  The voluntary disclosure team will bring you in from the cold in no time at all and bypass all of the other stuff you would have had to go through.

Letting the voluntary disclosure team know will always be preferable to action being taken by HMRC on discovery of the irregularity, which can range from financial penalties to publication of your details on the “Tax Defaulters” website or in the worst cases, criminal prosecution.  If you want more information on what could happen if you never tell HMRC read http://taxaid.org.uk/guides/taxpayers/undeclared-income/180-2

For your other point, the reason you might want an accountant is that it may make your tax bill lower than the cost of the accountant, and you shouldn't accidentally break any rules and end up paying a penalty.  For example, did you know that if you are running a business from a room in your house you can deduct the cost of the electricity and heating for that room as a cost of running your business?

Hell, RTD and his characters got incredible hate in his days, Moffat's only got the upper-hand because he has to simultaneously please the RTD/Tumblr crowd as well as the Classic Who crowd who literally want completely different things. 

An example: A part of the anti-Clara crowd criticises that she has ""too bland of a personality"", is ""sexualised"" and has an ""inconcistent"" and/or ""underdeveloped character"". Another part criticises that she is ""taking over Doctor Who"", has a ""much too overbearing and bossy personality"" and gets ""too much screentime"". Two points at the complete opposite ends of the spectrum, but somehow they feel united by a post entitled ""Does anybody else hate Clara?""

Moffat and his characters are disliked in the same way that almost any head of any government institution is disliked. From the left, from the right, from the old, from the young... The Moffat hate is far less of a hivemind than one might think, it's really just a selection of individuals, some of which may even have legitimate reasons beyond ""It's new and different"" that are somehow under the impression they share an opinion.

&gt;As it stands Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho will be the first choice centre-back pairing.

&gt;Both Lovren and Allen were solid and barely put a foot wrong against Adelaide United but they look likely to be bench warmers come August.

In an article on 24th July Pearce says [this](http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fc-boss-brendan-rodgers-9725915)

&gt; The France international was surprisingly left out of the final two tour friendlies in Adelaide and Kuala Lumpur.

&gt;Rodgers turned to Dejan Lovren instead but the Croatian defender did little to win over his critics.
&gt;Skrtel plays better with Sakho for company. The former Paris St Germain defender reads the game better than Lovren and is distribution is infinitely better.

&gt;**Anfield officials rubbished rumours that Sakho’s absence was due to a desire to leave the club. The hope is he’ll be back in a red shirt in Helsinki next Saturday.**

Not sure if this is 100% as things change and given Sakho's shay history with Rodgers. It doesn't make sense why Rodgers wouldn't try and get the pair together as much as possible due to our defensive frailties. As far as reliable sources go though it looks like Sakho is staying and starting. lets hope so!

Play by Play of PL Royal Rumble:

:01 Phil Jones injures himself climbing in the ring. He lays awaiting opponent number 1.


:30 Conor Wickham enters the ring. He's unable to throw Jones over the top rope because he's too busy flexing and wondering why he plays on the left wing all the time.


1:00 Shelvey enters the match and begins speaking parseltongue to Phil Jones, who is still lying injured in the corner.


1:30 Hector Bellerin enters the match yet nobody notices because they all think he looks like a donkey.


2:00 Fan favorite Charlie ""Local Plumbers' Union 434"" Adam enters the match with a gasp because running down the ramp took his legs out from under him.


2:30 No sooner than Samir Nasri enters the match and he's introduced to a reinvigorated Charlie Adam and his left boot. Nasri traveled an estimated 50 plus yards into the waiting arms of a very androgenous Jonny Evans. The 2 are believed to be  close to setting a date, though Nasri's penchant for being a problem in the locker room could create problems in the near future.


3:00 Martin Skrtel enters to a crowd of frightened looking men, and Phil Jones  is now heard whimpering in the corner.


3:30 Mr Nice Guy Darren Fletcher is next to enter but his stay was short. Somehow, Connor Wickham's right bicep exploded and knocked Fletcher over the top, disqualifying the WBA captain. Even injured Wickham is still imposing while demonstrating the proper technique to show a lat.


4:00 We already have 2 disqualifications and we're not even halfway through the entrances. Here comes the undisputed Mouth Breathing Champion of the World Harry Kane! This Spur looks ready for business, even if he does look moderately touched. 


4:30 Things are about to get intense as virtually unknown Tyrone Mings enters and immediately is donkey punched by...well...a donkey! Some how Hector Bellerin, unbeknownst to the rest of us...is an Animagus! Shelvey turns his attention away from Jones and begins surveying Bellerin. Mings isn't out but he is injured and is putting up more fight than that little bitch Phil Jones, who's still clutching his shin and whimpering in the corner.


5:00 we reached the halway mark and Gary Hooper looked a little apprehensive as he entered the ring but was soon in fine form as Martin Skrtel chased him around the squared circle.


5:30 This is relatively unheard of these days but we appear to have a self-disqualification. Kevin Nolan literally got so angry that he imploded on the apron.


6:00 We finally saw some life out of injured Connor Wickham as Bernard Mensah entered the match. Wickham appeared disgruntled about what we now understand to be Mensah's absolute shit finishing in FIFA 2015. Young Wickham choke slammed Mensah through the ceiling before tossing him out of the ring into a puddle of rapidly collecting tears from Phil Jones.


6:30 Dwight Gayle and his world class pace entered the ring to find that his fate had already been decided. Donning an eye patch and somehow conjuring a parrot and cutlass, Pirate Skrtel ran the young forward through and whispered ""3-3"" as he fell dead to the floor. 13 entrances in and we have our first fatality!


7:00 Phil Jagielka, aging veteran and average defender, made his way to the ring like he had something to prove and by god, he proved it. When last we saw him he was riding northeast on the back of Hector Bellerin (in human form) screaming ""Something is the matter with this horse!"" Both were disqualified after failing to return to the ring before the count.


7:30 Gary Cahill was unable to enter the match because he was living in John Terry's butthole and didn't get the invitation.


8:00 Uchoa, Leicester forward and all around strange looking guy was in the ring for .29 seconds before having to duck. Gary Hooper was traveling at Mach 1 as he left the ring from Charlie Adam's left foot and he nearly took of the South American's head.


8:30 Everyone's favorite spitter Papiss Cisse came on and was immediately greeted by a crunching head-butt from Harry Kane's numpty cromagnon skull. Cisse crawled to the kneeling Tyrone Mings, who was somehow still hanging around and decided to hide behind Phil Jones' wasted potential and gaping inconsistency.


9:00 The pride of Birmingham Gabby Agbonlahor made an immediate impact by clotheslining both Ulloa of Leicester and Harry Kane of Spurs out of the ring.


9:30 Our last man, young James Ward-Prowse enters the ring and immediately comes face to face with future teammate Martin Skrtel. ""We will come for you soon."" said Skrtel, before he gently lifted Ward-Prowse out of the ring and to the floor.


10:00 7 men, and Phil Jones, remain after a grueling 10 minutes. Skrtel, Mings, Cisse, Shelvey, Adam, Agbonlahor, Connor Wickham, and Lady boy Jones....


10:30 The violence is mounting, hopefully you've put your children to bed! Injured Mings, Cisse and Wickham were all medically disqualified after a bad tackle by Charlie Adam! There are limbs everywhere, mercy! Mercy!


11:00 Salivating Charlie Adam was chomping at the bit for another chance with that top, top left boot when that sniveling little twat of a she-man Phil Jones managed to distract him while his manager Louis Van Gal hit Adam in the back of the head with Ryan Giggs' brother's wife's folding chair! What are you doing out there, god save us all! Adam was dazed but he wasn't out of the fight. Shelvey used the killing curse on LVG and Paul Scholes for not being better than Gerrard before Skrtel made his presence known.


11:30 Martin Skrtel is a quiet man, but he will not suffer fuckery of any kind. When he saw the blatant cunty action of Phil Jones and Louis Van Gal, he immediately beat Jones, Januzaj, Fellaini, Caesar Azzawazzpackaleta, the entire Hazard clan, Demba Ba, Diego Costa, Roy Keane, Michael Owen, and Aidy Ward to death with the lifeless body of Dwight Gayle. He then helped a dazed Charlie Adam and he who shall not be named out of the ring. Even former Liverpool players never walk alone. 


Winner: Skrtel 2nd: Shelvey

Because if she couldn't, we wouldn't need that law you linked to. If someone aged 13-15 couldn't consent to sexual activity, then sex with someone under 16 would be rape (or sexual assault).

But the current law recognises the possibility that someone under 16 could consent, so has to add the age-specific offences; the ss5-8 offences involving someone under 13 and the ss9-15 offences for those under 16, with the reasonable belief about age part. While consent, or a reasonable belief in it, would block a prosecution under the basic ss1-4 offences, they aren't relevant to the later ones.

There are three main types of sexual offence.

1. The generic ones (rape, sexual assault etc.) apply to anyone, and hinge on consent (or a reasonable belief in it).

2. There are similar ones covering anyone under 13, which are the same but where there is no issue of consent (i.e. a prosecutor wouldn't need to prove a lack of consent).

3. There are some 'weaker' intermediate ones covering people under 16, which don't have an issue of consent, but do require that the prosecutor prove either the 'victim' was under 13 or that the defendant didn't reasonably believe the victim was 16 or over.

So if someone (A) has sex with someone else (B), and B is 15, if A reasonably believed B was 16, they couldn't be convicted under the 3. offences. Nor the 2. offences. But if there wasn't consent (and a reasonable belief in it) then one of the 1. offences might work.

PCs in the mid 90s were basically just raw power CPUs with a relatively fat chunk of RAM. Intel chips became more efficient per clock cycle than what Motorola were producing, and in raw terms began to compete with the specialised, unupgradable Amiga chips -Agnus and Denise (chipmem and graphics, mostly) and Paula (sound, mostly.) If the Amiga's chips could be upgraded it may have stuck around more, but there were only options to *add* on top - expensive CPU and CPU+GPU upgrades. If there was a fat, sweaty Agnus (Amiga has weird names) and a new generation Denise it may have been comparible with 3DFX, and if an upgradable Paula was comparible to Soundblaster the Amiga could have stuck around longer. But, most people owned small form factor 1200s and 500s (+/600s) and they only had one expansion slot which mostly got used for increasingly inadequate CPU boards. Big Amigas like 2000, 3000 and 4000s only had Zorro slots - if it was a more popular computer maybe 3DFX and Creative would have made Voodoo and Soundblasters in Zorro format, but the PCI and ISA's won out because the IBM clone PC was more widespread

I have loved my Pats since 1994, although honestly the NFL/NCAA has been stale for me over the last 4 years even with the titles, but Patriots style of ownership would not work here. Being able to break contracts with cash is the biggest difference, outside of much more leniency on wage bills. The patriots have been a success because they are not shooting for the high money players in the draft, and are instead trading down for more competition at each position, and create a team mentality where people stuff their ego's and re-structure their contracts in order to allow new people to join. Also the youth system in Europe, and the Draft system in the NFL are night and day. These kids are getting contracted in their teens. Imagine Pats scouts in LA watching pop warner games, and convincing their families to move to Foxboro at 13.

Because other teams can buy out contracts, and the caps work much differently, it creates a lot of mercenaries in the field. A Tom Brady in the EPL is an extremely rare thing. 1 superstar player for 1 team, that doesn't force outrageous wages to stay at the club, although he is still paid well.

If you earn any money at all from any kind of work or business, then you should tell HMRC about it (even if it's below the personal allowance). If the amount of money you earn is more than your tax free allowance each year (£10,600 for the 2015-2016 tax year) then you will need to pay the appropriate taxes on any amount earned over that.

Usually the company that you are employed by deal with all that for you. They'll tell HMRC and they will deduct the appropriate taxes from your pay cheque before giving you your monthly/weekly wage.

However, as you have no company employing you, you need to do that for yourself.

**Setup**

The simplest thing to do to start is to register yourself with HMRC as a ""sole trader"". There is [some information here](https://www.gov.uk/working-for-yourself/what-you-need-to-do) that should help. Being a sole trader is the simplest and most basic way of working for yourself. You don't have to get into any of the complexities of setting up a legal business or a limited company, you don't have to setup new/business bank accounts, you don't have to do any corporate accounts. It's really very simple. If all you are doing is generating income, then that is likely the best bet for you to start. It would be better to do it sooner rather than later to give yourself some time to get used to everything before your tax return is due.

**Tax Returns**

In order to let HMRC know how much money you have earnt and how much tax you owe, you will need to complete a Self Assessment Tax Return for each financial year. It seems pretty daunting, but once you get into it it is pretty easy to complete, although can end up being quite a lot of admin work for you. As part of registering with HMRC mentioned above, you will be able to setup an online account that will enable you to complete the your tax return online if you wish.

The tax year runs from 6th April each year to the 5 April of the following year. Once the tax year is finished you then have until 31st October to complete your tax return if you want to do it the old school way of filling in paper forms, or until 31st January if you do it through your online account. I highly suggest doing it online. The calculations are all done for you once you input your figures and it removes a bunch of hassle and possible mistakes. You can easily Google around for help, or follow the help points on the HMRC website.

We are currently in the 2015-2016 tax year that runs from 6th April 2015 to 5th April 2016. So after April 2016 you have until 31st October 2016 or 31st January 2017 to complete your tax return.

If you earned any income from this business between 6th April 2015 to 5th April 2016, then you will need to submit a tax return for last year. You have until October 2015/January 2016 to complete that. So if that applies to you, you still have plenty of time to do it but you might want to get onto it asap.

**How much tax to pay/Gross and Net Profit/Expenses**

When you fill in your tax return the online system will calculate how much you owe and where and when to send it. However, you can reduce your tax bill in various ways. If you do work related to your business in your home then you will be able claim some of the costs you incur as business related expenses. For example, if you are at home all day working on your business then you are using electricity that you might otherwise not be using if you were at a place of employment instead. Some self employed people make the decision to live in a bigger house, to include a home office, than they might otherwise have if they worked elsewhere. If you travel to see clients you're using your vehicle/pubic transport that you wouldn't usually. All of these imply that your business costs you more money and so you can claim parts of these costs as business expenses.

When calculating your tax owed, you take your full (gross) income and then you subtract any eligible business expenses to get to your final (net) income. Tax is only paid on the this net income.

As you live with your parents, and they get benefits, this might be complicated. There may be guides online if you search around, but this may be something that means you would want to look into hiring an accountant.

**Other considerations**

You mentioned benefits for your parents, so this may be a problem points. A proper accountant will be able to help you here. It's certainly fine for *you* to be self employed, but it might have negative effects on your parents benefits. I don't know this for sure, so definitely look into this.

VAT - it is mandatory for you to register for and charge/pay VAT if your business earns more than £82,000 during the financial year. If you earn less than that it is optional to do so. It can offer some savings, although can also be a bit more hassle than it is worth.

Being a sole trader offers you none of the safeguards of a full company. You essentially are your business, so if it loses money then you lose money. If it loses money really badly, then you've got problems. If it/you go bankrupt, whoops.

Setting up a legitimate limited company offers protections. You are no longer your business. It is its own entity and if it fails, it does so separately from you. They can also be used to limit how much tax you have to pay if you get into the world of paying yourself via dividends etc, although that is probably more info than you need right now. But it's something to bear in mind.

&gt;I would much prefer to just be self employed and give all my documents to an accountant at the end of the year and job done, is this possible?

This is definitely possible. I would suggest searching around for a local accountant that advertises dealing with online businesses and see if they can help. Alternatively there are online only accountants that also do the same thing. Maybe see if you can find some poeple who are in the same industry as you and reach out and ask what they do for accountants. When you speak to an accountant they will be able to tell you everything you need to do, such as all the records you need to keep, what they will want from you, how you deal with PayPal etc. they'll help you far more specifically than we ever could. But if you are going to go down this route, the earlier the better so you have more time to get all your documentation etc in order.",null,0,null,1437771288,null,0,false,0,ctf0qrr,null,t3_3egjh9,null,t1_ctf0qrr,null,t3_3egjh9,null,null,null,1440065783,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

I'd previously gone through all of 8's audios and a couple of highly recommended ones, but lately I've been going through the entire main range in order. Listened to Jubilee and Spare Parts again over the past few days, they're both really amazing stories. I love how deranged everyone in Jubilee is.

The thing Big Finish is amazing at doing is setting a really unsettling atmosphere. Citing two of my absolute favorite 8 stories for this - The Chimes Of Midnight (can be listened to standalone but you should probably check out Storm Warning first to get introduced to Charley) is an amazing time loop story that uses repetition and minor changes really well. There's also the sheer auditory orgasm that is Scherzo that is more arc heavy but is probably the best thing I have ever listened to across any medium.

More fans of the series need to check out these audios - the 8th Doctor is an amazing starting point since he only had two onscreen appearances so it doesn't feel like you're just jumping into the middle of his run - what kept me from checking out the audios of the classic Doctors was the fact that I haven't seen most of them on screen yet, but Big Finish is causing me to go back and revisit some earlier stories. There were some really good Davros stories, including a prequel/setup to Genesis Of The Daleks that made me go back and watch Genesis as my first 4th Doctor story. Spare Parts is making me want to go watch the first Cyberman episodes to see their origin since it's a far better representation of them than anything New Who has had so far, and is making me really interested in seeing how their birth played out on the screen. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/BigFinish/comments/1qsifa/a_guide_to_the_eighth_doctor_audio_stories/

Here's a really useful guide to 8's audio stories if anyone wants to start with him like I did. There are two good jumping on points - Storm Warning in the main range with Charley, and Blood Of The Daleks in the Eighth Doctor Adventures with Lucie.

But as the week wore on he looked at the opportunity he was being given at City more and more rationally and realized he couldn't pass it up. I think that is why he looks so emotionless in all his City introduction pics. He knows he burned all the bridges at a place he actually liked and respected, and he's got the mercenary's face on now.

Some interior walls may also be load-bearing. For a second floor, wide boards (2x10), or depending on the span, engineered beams can hold the weight of a floor. The roof however has to hold a snow load, the weight of itself and any additional factors. A truss spans from bearing point to bearing point (exterior walls in my example) so it is designed with webs (the angles pieces you see in these trusses). Trusses are engineered to dissipate the weight over the span back to the bearing points. For the Anfield expansion, large concrete columns act as the bearing points down to solid ground. The truss then spreads the load of the roof it will hold back to the bearing points.

Trusses, or girders (as I would think the Anfield piece might be), allow for an open space without support columns halfway.

Although I think the Empire is a mixed bag. It's undeniable we did horrible things that we still don't accept or face but a lot of the institutions, systems and concepts we left behind have stuck and I think they've stuck but they're ultimately a good thing. Parliaments, courts and common law, education and even cricket! You can see the legacy of the Magna Carta in the US Constitution and our Parliamentary democracy on the US Government to an extent or Canada and Australia to a greater extent. 

Now that may just be countries Britain shaped in it's image so we naturally feel more at home when we see that and elsewhere there is nothing valuable about those legacies but still I think they are just *morally* good institutions. I can't shake that bias. I can't understand how people would want something else. 

Not really sure what my point is. Probably that while you're right we need to revisit things I think it would be unfair not to acknowledge the good things as well. It seems to me to be very mixed.

The data I was using was for ""offenders sentenced"" - so this would count as 6 ""offenders sentenced"" even though between the six of them they were convicted on 17 counts of the offences I was looking at (only 20 of the 47 charges stuck).

Most of these charges were of rape, one of child prostitution, one of sexual activity with a child.

However, it is difficult to break down the statistical data on offenders sentenced for rape by the age of their victim, as that doesn't seem to be included in the categories I have. However, I do have that break-down for defendants proceeded against. Out of them, 41% of those proceeded against in reference to rape of a female, and 74% of rape of a male, were charged in relation to a victim under 16. So I factored that in to the data.

That's where the 1,090 figure comes in, and why it is rougher than the 992 figure, which is more precise.

However, there may also be some overlap; for example, if someone was sentenced for both rape and sexual activity with a child, they might be included in both figures.

Nope. PACE governs this, it's not just made up on the spot. If you have committed a recordable offence, then the power exists to have these taken from you. 

&gt;I eventually received a lesser punishment which could have been issued had I been sober and not been arrested.

Cautions can't be issued on the street. Are you sure you've not been issued a penalty notice upon sobering up in custody?

In terms of the DBS, all cautions, convictions (both spent and unspent) will turn up on a certificate.

A DBS certificate is not meant to be a certificate of good conduct and aside from certain serious offences, no conviction is an automatic bar to employment.
The purpose of a DBS certificate is to allow an employer considering placing an individual in certain roles involving work with children and vulnerable adults to make an informed employment decision by giving them sight of an individual's full conviction history.

All organisations who take advantage of the DBS service are required to sign up to the statutory code of conduct which requires them to set out a policy regarding the employment of ex-offenders and how they intend to manage an adverse disclosure.

Laptop as you can see is in very good nick, I look after my kit obsessively and has been my mobile programming and gaming solution for a long while. Has never overheated and is surprisingly quick due to ssd.

Also I'm selling a CX750 corsair PSU and an r7-250x however can't timestamp due to being away for work until weds.

Looking to buy a high end 450w plus PSU, a desktop 4GB/8GB ram DDR3 DIMM, accept general hardware as I build PCs for people. Thanks.

Since BBC3 seems to be going down the drain (lack of new shows and current shows being moved to dead times on bbc2) and with all the cuts being made across the business I do think a few things need to happen.     
Keep BBC1 as a more factual channel with Prime time for shows that don't fight for airtime (as much as possible saturday night excluded as everyone competes there) and combining with BBC 4 to fill the dead hours when numbers drop.     
BBC 2 should be entertainment as it is already taking on some of BBC 3s shows just move the rest over.    
BBC radio should be split off and run as a separate company and a reduction in the stations they offer.
BBC should start to allow advertising. not in the way other stations do with a break every 15 mins, just between shows to keep up the short fall. BUT with services not PPI and that sort of thing because everyone hates those.    
The last and might be the easiest to do is stop making terrible shows. Some of the shows that fill the BBC network are bloody terrible and that seems to universally thought.     
The kids channels are great as is though CBBC seems to be lacking in new content recently but the new shows on CBeeBees is just going from pillar to post with new content that is amazing compared to what I had when I was young(not a creepy adult just have a kid)
Dropping the 24 hour news channel might be a good idea as well moving it to lots of short shows on live stream instead along side the news on BBC 1
Not expecting this sort of thing to happen over night but a good long term plan and frees up 3 channels. Though it does leave 2 of the channels empty for 10-12 hours a day so maybe renting them out to local stations to increase viewer numbers for them and the stations.

I was young, ignorant and chose to hide my head under a rock about the whole situation... Anyway, once I was looking to get a mortgage I was obliged by the bank to back track and prove 3 years earnings with use of an accountant. It was then when I declared those earnings and ultimately paid back the small amount of tax that was owed (a lot of it was covered by my PAYE work) and all without having to pay any of the hefty late fees - point being, if you're only a couple of months behind so far I'm sure you'll be fine! :)

However, this suggests that there is probably somewhere between a 2:1 and 1:2 ratio of ""white"" to ""Asian"" mass-grooming offenders, based on a very small, and not necessarily representative sample.

Combined with the more reliable data on offending and convictions, this at least suggests that there may be a comparable number of ""white"" localised grooming cases as ""Asian"" ones. Yet they seem to be reported far less often (although I don't have data on this specifically).

Putting my Lib Dem hat on (I joined after the election), I almost wonder if you're posting this to show how wrong this article has proven to be - even two and a bit months after the election.

Taking the central points:

**1.  ""I'm sticking by what we did. Going into government with the Tories was the right thing to do.""**

There are actually a lot of reasons to suggest this was true. The coalition government was, in many ways, actually quite stable and successful. The country didn't go to the dogs and some positive things even came out of it, like the raise in personal allowance. If the Lib Dems hadn't gone in to government with the Tories, the result would have been a minority government which would very likely have led to another general election. That general election might have solidified Tory support at the expense of the Lib Dems (e.g. protest over, Lib Dems not interested in government despite the opportunity etc etc). I agree that the Lib Dems could've negoitiated better on some things, but I'd disagree that they should never have gone in to government. History is already treating them rather more kindly in that regard

**2.  ""Just you wait and see. Things are going to get a whole lot worse now, then you'll miss us.""**

I'm not going to say too much on this, but I'd just point out the latest budget (and the further announced savings, Teresa May's plans for human rights, and the potential serious scaling back of the BBC. If you're a liberal and either in the political centre or on the left, then things certainly are going to get a whole lot worse. Coalition will seem like a picnic.


**3.  ""The 2015 General Election result was a terrible defeat for liberalism in the UK.""**

Is this really in doubt? Let's face it, the Lib Dems are basically the only respectable voice for liberal views in the UK. Both Labour and the Tories are actually fairly authoritarian and, whilst the Greens are liberal, they're also a collection of barm pots and are a million miles from being electable. 

There's a reason why the Lib Dems are already polling at around 10% even after the electoral decapitation.

Penetrative sex without consent = rape. You can't consent to sex under 16.

But the CPS *rarely* prosecutes it like that. 1) harder to prove. You have to prove penetration. The girls often protect the rapists, and unless you've got evidence like semen still in the girl or video evidence, then it often gets dropped. 2) Juries don't convict... They see the girls as promiscuous and compliant, and come back with 'not guilty' verdicts.

This is why the CPS often go for 'sexual activity with a child'. It's much easier to secure evidence and convictions.

Source: I have a law degree, and was lectured by one of UK's leading experts on gender issues in criminal law.

Edit: though you are right that there are defences to it! E.g. mistake as to the age of the minor. It's another spanner in the works for the CPS.

Under 13 = no defence. At all!

But even then, the CPS often go for 'sexual activity with a child' because of evidential issues and jury nullification.

Why aren't Nazis invited to speak on the Daily Politics? Because the majority of the country views their beliefs as contemptible and completely at odds with (and I'm beginning to hate this phrase) 'British values.' 

Islamism needs to be seen as comparable to Nazism. Sharia law is sexist, homophobic, at odds with free speech, and treats non-Muslims as sub-human or at the very least second-class citizens. Just look to the human rights abuses of Saudi Arabia or Iran to see Islamism in practise.

Now, as a liberal and firm believer in freedom of expression, I do not think Islamist preachers should be prevented from speaking or holding demonstrations in the same way Neo-Nazis are allowed to. But there simply isn't the same societal condemnation of Islamism as there is of Nazism, because the former is viewed as part of a cultural identity among British Muslims and therefor immune to criticism.

It's such a stupid point but we need to remind ourselves that while the statistics comparing crimes of these types seem to have a disproportionate amount of Muslim men as the offender, the amount of Muslim men committing these crimes is very very small and because it's so small we are literally talking about a few fractions of percentage points difference between the prevalence in the white population and the Asian population. Tiny tiny divergences that while obviously important do not lay the blame at the entirety of a race.

We have a moral duty to look at what lead to these crimes and looking at aspects of religion, culture and  ethnicity should not be shied away from. But it is *their* religion and *their* culture and *their* family history that needs to be analysed and how *they* could possibly commit these crimes in that cultural context. It doesn't give us a right to transpose all of that onto an entire populace a majority of which are law abiding citizens. There may well be elements of and where we find them they need to be challenged but we do not have the right to blame an entire culture or to single out a group of individuals because of race.

Ultimately doing so may make things worse. By putting too much emphasis on religion and race you make it very hard for people to disassociate from these crimes and the aspects of culture that may encourage them. When you say the whole is Islam is responsible the only way out you leave to disassociate is for people to denounce their faith, which practically people won't do. And when you say a whole race of people is responsible you trap them. And this allows negative cultural aspects to spread.

It's also very easy to judge other people's culture and say that people who do hold to cultural norms that may lead to problems are bad people. This is totally wrong and while I am very certain we should criticize and deeply criticize things we honestly think are damaging we should not presume bad intentions. 

It was not so long ago that cultural norms of modesty held I'm sure by many good people thinking it was for the best played a part in allowing white paedophiles to operate without being stopped.

This is a longer reply than I was expecting to do and I am very deeply concerned about what is it that is leading to more Asian men to comit these crimes. But they are the ones found guilty, not the entire Asian population.

The issue of it being a Byelaw is apparently contrary to a simple police caution, but I am neither a policeman nor a lawyer so my frame of reference is shaky at best. It is of equivalence or at least very similar in severity, according to my solicitor, to receiving a caution for having your feet on the seat of a train. It wasn't a fine [penalty notice], but I do believe that I was essentially held in custody in order that the situation be clarified and established when I had sobered up as I was not in a fit state to provide accurate information immediately. [There was an issue of potential intent to offend, which it became manifestly clear there wasn't following my return to sobriety, explaining the byelaw caution rather than anything of greater severity.]

I suppose the one thing I am clear on is that honesty would be wiser in interview if asked than running the risk of it not showing up and being rejected later should it be present. I am interested to know whether from the information I have given you can glean whether the offence I have committed would be of less severity to an employer than evidence of dishonesty [dishonesty seems to be universal rejection]. This seems to be the case and would like further advice here. Finally, if people have experience with applications for legal careers, I would be interested to gauge the extent to which this would potentially hinder me should I opt for that path in the future.

Does Labour require his type of politics? I don't know. I think a centrist-Labour only worked because the Tory party was in a bad enough state to poach voters from, but as long as the Tories are a credible choice, the only voters available to a centrist Labour are people who are too far right to vote for a left-leaning Labour, but still somehow far-enough to the left that they wouldn't vote Tory. The question is whether that section of the population is larger then the left-leaning voters they'd lose by being centrist.

However, does Labour require his type of politician? Abso-fucking-lutely. I think the political scene as a whole needs a Corbyn-type politician on the main stage for a while. We're up to our necks in superficiality. More than ever it's what you're seen to be doing, avoiding saying anything controversial and making your opponent look bad without committing to anything yourself (because that alienates people and loses you votes), while throwing out meaningless platitudes that could apply to anyone, which is why we reached a point where the three main parties were indistinguishable to a lot of people (you believe in a future for our children and helping hard working families?

Here are a few facts for you :

&gt; starting striker 


- Firmino made  his debug in Nov 2014 for brazil.  Thats just 8 months ago.

- He has played just 4 competitive games for Brazil ( 10 in total including friendlies )

&gt;Firmino is undoubtedly one of our 11 best footballers

- He hasnt even met the team yet and we are 2 weekends away from a away game at Stoke.

- He has never played in  the Premier league , yes he has played in Germany , but with all  due respect PL is a different ball game.

On the other hand  ,  Lallana knows the PL , knows the way Liverpool play and has had the  full pre season. 

Yes Firmino has bags of  potential but even the good players need time . I will completely understand if Rodgers decides to not start him and give  him a 10/20 min cameo.

Like I said , he might start if he plays well in the remaining friendlies , but if he doesnt  it would be disrespectful to think he would still be  selected over some of the other talented players we have.


Just because  he is foreign and a big money signing  people just wet there pants  over him. He needs the same time to gel as other players did.

 I believe he will be a good signing and will have a great career at Liverpool, but I will not disillusion myself into believing that we have signed the next Neymar.

&gt; You don't need me to walk you through the way that these women are drawn to see the racist tropes in their depiction — tropes that come directly from colonial-era racist ideas about Africans as sub-human, and tropes that are unnecessary to make the magazine's point about welfare. And the emphasis of the cover, making light of Nigerian victims of mass rape in order to skewer French politicians, is uncomfortably revealing. The very real suffering of these women is treated insensitively, as a low priority.

&gt; This is a regular pattern in Charlie Hebdo's cartoons, even if you see the two-layer satire they often play at. People of color are routinely portrayed with stereotypical features — Arabs given big noses, Africans given big lips — that are widely and correctly considered racist. These features are not necessary for the jokes to work, or for the characters to be recognizable. And yet Charlie Hebdo has routinely included them, driving home a not-unreasonable sense that the magazine's cartoons indulged racism.

&gt; Further, the portrayal of people of color, as well as Muslims of all races, has been consistently and overwhelming negative in Charlie Hebdo cartoons. Reading Charlie Hebdo cartoons and covers in the aggregate, a reader is given the uniform and barely-concealed message that Muslims are categorically bad, violent, irrational people. This characterization indulges and indeed furthers some of the widest and most basic stereotypes of the world's 1.6 billion Muslims.
