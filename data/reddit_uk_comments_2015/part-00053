Cleverley did very little against Chelsea and has done very little all season. You don't need stats to know that - you just have to watch the game. I never would have thought Cleverley looking out of his depth at a shit club like ours but that's the reality.

Football is not a stats-driven game. Particularly, possession means fuck all most of the time. We had so much possession against Chelsea NOT because we dominated them and took the game to them, but because they allowed us to pass it around the back. They had Drogba up front and he's clearly not going to chase the way Costa would.

As a contrast, last season, we regularly had possession in the 30%s and we were scoring and beating teams - teams including Chelsea - because we did the same: sit deep and attack on the break. It was a totally anti-football philosophy but at least it worked. This season you've got midfielders who can't retain and distribute the ball (particularly Delph and Sanchez) being instructed to do just that.

As we agree that posession is unimportant, what would be more telling is how many games our last 100 shots spanned. I suspect more than an inability to convert chances, the reality is that we have so few chances per game. Chance creation is the problem here. There's just no point to having Benteke if you're passing the ball at the back for 50 minutes, and him having 1 or 2 touches all game. We need a tactical shift - one that involves proper wingers. If we did that, we could reintroduce Darren Bent too, though the damage we have caused him is probably too much to repair now.

null,false,Tophattingson,null,null,null,"The Political Compass is ridiculously flawed. It has a number of leading questions which people will either be unable to answer, or be forced to answer in a way the authors of the test deem Left/Libertarian. As a result, the test shunts everyone towards the bottom left.

The test authors then shove near every real mainstream political party and politician into the upper left corner to make people who take the test think ""Wow, these fascist cunts don't share my views at all, time to vote for the greens even though I'm clearly centre-right outside of the bizarre world that is this test"".

Seriously, look at this shit: http://www.politicalcompass.org/images/internationalchart.png

**They put the fucking leader of the Communist Party of China further to the economic right than just about anyone else.** From this alone it should be obvious that the authors of the test have no real methodology to making these charts comparing politicians and political parties beyond ""The more we hate this person, the more we are gona cram them in the top right"".

And that's the TL;DR, now for the in-depth analysis.

**The Author's Bias**

Using the phrase ""Neo-liberal orthodoxy"", ""neoliberal agenda"" and similar multiple times is a clear indication of the political views of the test writers, which is strongly left-wing. It's akin to saying ""Socialist agenda"" or ""Marxist agenda"" which would act as an indication the author is strongly right-wing.

They've done a relatively good job avoiding other blatant examples of this, so we have to look into what questions they ask.

**Leading and flawed Questions**

A lot of the questions on the test are leading. In almost all these cases, they will make even the most staunchly right-wing test-taker select the left-leaning answer. As a result, people who are clearly on the economic right will still typically receive a left-leaning test result.

Example 1: ""If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.""

There is no way for people who believe the interests of corporations and humanity are identical to answer this. When queried on this, the test authors basically ignored the criticism. So even the most economically right-wing person will give the left-leaning answer of disagree.

Example 2: ""Because corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, they require regulation.""

This question outright states to the reader ""Corporations cannot be trusted"". Those who believe corporations can be trusted are once again left unable to answer and forced towards the left leaning answer, similar to Example 1.

Example 3: It is regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society.

People who believe that financial systems are actually useful (i.e anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of finance and economics) are once again left unable to answer this question, as they believe those who 'manipulate money' do contribute to society.

Example 4: ""A significant advantage of a one-party state is that it avoids all the arguments that delay progress in a democratic political system.""

You can believe this is true without supporting a one-party state, but the test will give you increased authoritarianism for agreeing with this.

Example 5: ""Abstract art that doesn't represent anything shouldn't be considered art at all.""

Someone's opinion on this has no bearing on their political views.

Example 6: ""Multinational companies are unethically exploiting the plant genetic resources of developing countries.""

This question doesn't actually even make sense. ""Plant genetic resources"" are not a thing that can be exploited, and seems to indicate the authors don't actually know what genetics are. Of course, being a leading question, most people will select Agree which is the left-wing response.

Example 7: ""Pornography, depicting consenting adults, should be legal for the adult population.""

The left has no unified views on this; Feminism is split into pro-porn and anti-porn camps on this despite both groups being broadly left-wing. This is not an appropriate question if it's unclear which side the left adopts on this issue.

Example 8: ""Astrology accurately explains many things""

The test authors decided that agreeing with this is a conservative belief and that disagreeing with this is a liberal belief. In reality, left-leaning people seem more likely to believe in Astrology than right-leaning people.

Citation: http://www.pewforum.org/2009/12/09/many-americans-mix-multiple-faiths/#3

Example 9: ""Governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public.""

Even the most economically right-wing person will not believe that fraud should be permitted. Hence everyone will put the left-wing response to this question.

**The Results Page**

Just so you don't have to go through the test, here's one I cooked up earlier: http://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2?ec=0.0&amp;soc=0.0

Many of the phrases on this page are harsh criticisms of right leaning governments, while it simultaneously completely avoids ALL criticism of left-leaning politics. I'm not going through them all because it's ALL bad, but i'm just pointing out the worst examples here.

Example 1: ""which couples social Darwinian right-wing economics""

Right-wing economics are not inherently ""Social Darwinian"". This is a clear attempt by the test authors to make people thing that capitalists = mass murdering fascists.

Example 2: ""Hitler, on an economic scale, was not an extreme right-winger. His economic policies were broadly Keynesian""

This is bad history. Hitler mostly ignored economic policy outside of war preparations, and by 1940 germany had a looting economy that was dependant on conquest of new territory to remain functional. This has nothing to do with Keynesian economics.

Example 3: ""Paradoxically, the ""free market"", in neo-con parlance, also allows for the large-scale subsidy of the military-industrial complex""

This is the only time a modern political ideology is singled out for direct criticism.

**Take the Test as a political party**

Seriously, take the test. Take it acting as one of the political parties that are ranked on the compass. Take it acting as the most extreme viewpoints of that political party. See if you can push it anywhere near as right-leaning and authoritarian as they have listed it as on the chart OP linked.

null,false,ToffeeScience,alt1,,null,"Midfield is key if you want to dominate games, and especially central midfield becomes important. 
Everton has had some classic midfields and there are others that will be able to tell you more about those. Read up on the Holy Trinity that was the heart of one of Evertons legendary teams. The midfield in the team in the mid eighties was another great one, and we are hopefully seeing the start of a new one.

Wingers usually transport the ball through the less populated wide areas of the pitch and cross the ball into the box usually assisted by our very attacking minded wing backs. We are one of the teams that uses width most effectively to create chances. This current season Coleman and Baines have been less effective however but the reason for that is the lack of coverage due to McCarthy missing resulting in their attacking contribution has been limited due to having to focus on defensive tasks.

With wing backs going forward as much as they do in modern football the center backs are vulnerable to counter attacks and at the same time have got few passing options other than the long ball, this is one of the reasons the central midfielders are important as they are the first line of defense as well as the closest passing options when playing from the back. The defensive or deep midfielders (or central midfielders depending on the formation) are vital both to defend and turn defense into attack a quality which is vital especially in continental competitions. 

The attacking midfielder is the player that is positioned between the striker(s) and the central midfield, usually Barkley fills this role at Everton. (the middle one of the 3 of the 4-2-3-1) His job is to use his pace or passing ability to basically do the job the wide players do but through the middle of the field, he will combine with the striker having received the ball from the central midfielders. 

In the derby we used 3 deep midfielders (Barry, Besic and McCarthy which limited Liverpools attack to long shots and a few crosses that could easily be dealt with. 
In the modern game, especially in continental competitions its important to have a numerical advantage in the middle of the pitch both in order to reduce your opponents attacking options and give yourself more passing options in order to retain possession. 

Basically a formations weakness would be where they are outnumbered by the opponent, and you want to keep the ball where you are in control numerically. A midfield formation has to be viewed together with the defense and attack in order to know what its trying to achieve. I don't think I'm oversimplifying by saying you could basically count what the formation is meant to do.

A 3 man defense is vulnerable to teams attacking with width as in order to close down the winger they would lose shape, therefore they would need support from the midfield. Likewise a team that uses attacking wing backs, like Everton, are in effect employing a 2 man defense when the team is going forward and the midfield has to be aware and ready to do a job defensively. 
How many strikers you use are also going to determine the type of service they will require, a single striker will depend on either through passes or crosses and can easily be isolated. A single striker is usually accompanied with a five man midfield.

null,false,SleepingFish,null,null,null,"The point of Can in the back three is that he can bring the ball out from deep though and start attacks. When we were playing poor at the start of the season it was because Gerrard was being man marked and none of the defenders (Skrtel &amp; Lovren) could come forward and make a real contribution to the forward play because it was easy to close us down - also we had no threat in behind opposition defences to frighten teams. This lack of threat allowed teams to push higher up and press out back four/Gerrard easily. 


Now though we have Can and Sakho who are both adept at bringing the ball forward and finding a midfielder or forward, and with studge or sterling up front we also have that threat in behind that was so vital to us last season. Now teams have to sit deeper to try counter balls behind them, which makes it more difficult for them to get as high forward and press is, and with two defenders able to bring the ball out it also makes it harder for them to nullify them as they need to chase both - or chose one to target like Everton done. (Targeted Sakho).


Don't get me wrong, I want Can in midfield as much as the next guy. Ahead of Allen for sure! I'm even willing Lovren to get a chance. Toure I suspect won't play for a while after just winning the AFCON and playing extra time etc.. Lovren does have the ability to play the ball, not as well as Can obviously, but he's not been great defending wide in the channels, plus he'd be right centre back which might affect him as he prefers the left.

Since the semi-aquatic rodent was a skilled swimmer, the Church declared that the beaver was a fish. Being a fish, beaver barbeques were permitted throughout Lent. Problem solved!

---

&gt;

&gt;Upon imprisonment in England, Kelly, and the other prisoners went on [hunger strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_strike) demanding political prisoner status and to be transferred to prisons in Northern Ireland. After 60 days on hunger strike, during which he subsequently alleged he was force-fed by prison officers, Kelly was transferred to [HMP Maze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMP_Maze) prison in Northern Ireland in April 1975. 

&gt;Whilst imprisoned in the Maze, Kelly again went on protest and made a number of escape attempts in 1977, 1982 and 1983. On 25 September 1983, Kelly was involved in the [Maze Prison escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_Prison_escape), the largest break-out of prisoners in Europe since [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) and in British prison history.   Kelly, along with 37 other republican prisoners, armed with six hand-guns, hijacked a prison meals lorry and smashed their way out of [HMP Maze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMP_Maze) past 40 prison wardens and 28 alarm systems. During the escape Kelly shot and injured a prison warden in the head as the officer attempted to foil the escape. 

&gt;After the mass break-out Kelly was on the run for three years and again became involved in an [active service unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Service_Unit) in Europe. Whilst on the run Kelly claimed that he was aided in his escape by ""all kinds of people,"" including prominent [Fianna Fáil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianna_F%C3%A1il) and [Fine Gael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_Gael) supporters in the [Republic of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland).

&gt;

&gt;The IRA planted four [car bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_bombs) in London on 8 March 1973. Two of the car bombs were defused: a fertilizer bomb in a car outside the Post Office in [Broadway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway,_London) and the BBC's armed forces radio studio in Dean Stanley Street. However, the other two exploded, one near the [Old Bailey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bailey) and the other at [Ministry of Agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Agriculture) off [Whitehall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall). As a result of the explosions one person was killed and almost 200 people were injured. 

&gt;Kelly, then aged 19, and eight others, including [Hugh Feeney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Feeney) and sisters [Marian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_Price) and [Dolours Price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolours_Price), were found guilty of various charges relating to the bombings on 14 November 1973. Kelly was convicted of causing explosions and conspiracy to cause explosions, and received two life sentences plus twenty years.

Whether you are lucky or not is at the heart of a welfare state. If you are lucky enough to be born into wealth and privilege you don't need help. If you are lucky enough to not be disabled you don't need help. If you are lucky enough to have and keep a well paid job you don't need help.

The idea that luck should not factor into welfare is insane. Should we refuse people JSA because they knew one of the risks of working today is being made redundant? Should we refuse disability to those who were in traffic accidents because they should have accepted the risk of travelling in a car?

Welfare should be based upon need, not risk, otherwise you are standing in moral judgement of other people's decisions at every turn, which you cannot hope to made effective judgements on as you never see the whole picture and in many cases things are more complex than first appearances suggest. That was my original point in my post: that not all instance of action fit into the same category so easily.

Welfare can only be provided to those who are in most need. We should, I agree, provide it first to those in greatest need and then to progressively more of the population from there. But children are expensive whether you like it or not and the ""joy"" of having a child (no one talks about it because it's taboo but having a child is hard and fucking miserable at times and some people just hate it) doesn't pay for their shoes or nappies.

The turkey appeared on Christmas tables in England in the 16th century,[9] and popular history tells of King Henry VIII being the first English monarch to have turkey for Christmas.[10] The 16th century farmer Thomas Tusser noted that by 1573 turkeys were commonly served at English Christmas dinners.[7] The tradition of turkey at Christmas rapidly spread throughout England in the 17th century,[9] and it also became common to serve goose which remained the predominant roast until the Victorian era.[11] (it was quite common for Goose ""Clubs"" to be set up, allowing working-class families to save up over the year towards a goose before this).[12] A famous Christmas dinner scene appears in Dickens' A Christmas Carol (1843), where Scrooge sends Bob Cratchitt a large turkey.[13] The pudding course of a British Christmas dinner may often be Christmas pudding, which dates from medieval England.[14] Trifle, mince pies, Christmas cake or a yule log are also popular.[15]*",null,0,null,1423553866,null,0,false,0,cogv4cb,null,t3_2vcaad,null,t1_cogv4cb,null,t3_2vcaad,null,null,null,null,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

The best travel shows now are usually wrapped up in other subjects; reasons to travel rather than just 'let's go there and tell you where to stay and go'. A couple of good examples of these kinds of shows (in addition to the ones above) include:

That's the worse historical revisionism I've seen in a while.

It was Labour that introduced the Scottish Parliament after the preceding Constitutional Convention was boycotted by the SNP.

It was Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives who introduced the Scotland Act 2012 after the preceding Calman Commission was - once again - boycotted by the SNP.

It was only after the SNP's very raison d'être was rejected by Scots at the ballot box in September last year that they actually bothered to finally turn up to a devolution discussion and grudgingly accepted and signed up to the Smith Commission, before attacking it the very same day as not being enough.

The SNP simply give no fucks about devolution or any sort of change within the United Kingdom and they don't care about what anyone else thinks about the EU - their aim is to whip up discontent here and hope that the rest of the UK gets so pissed off that it cuts Scotland adrift out of frustration; independence by the back door.

* The rent is usually controlled. The rented portion of the flat is typically owned by a housing association. This means manageable increases in rent each year (usually RPI or CPI). 

* You hedge your interest-based mortgage costs against more fixed rental costs. Less likely to get into ugly interest-spike difficulty. The rent component is usually less  than the interest on a mortgage would be anyway.

* You're not on the hook for structural repairs (can be a good deal depending on what your service charge is). Although you are liable to chip into the sinking fund.

* Once you've paid off your 25%, you can buy the remaining chunks of the property without a mortgage; just save a couple of grand every year and then write them a cheque to buy a portion.

* You'll have a great Loan-to-value ratio that the bank will love, and you'll have your pick of the best mortgages available.

However there are flaws, particularly with what you've described. You're looking to get 25% of the property, but have calculated your mortgage repayments based on a 25 or 30 year mortgage period. It would take you 100 years to buy the whole property. You should therefor consider making your mortgage period 1/4 of the standard length. This will of course increase your monthly costs.

That being said, I would always take the longest term (30 years) and then just make overpayments - because if I get into a sticky financial situation, I can relax my payments from the 10 year repayment schedule back to 30 years without pissing the bank off.

Consider the following: an 8 year term (or over-payments to that effect) will cost you £270/month, rather than £100. For every 1% increase in the base rate, you'll be on the hook for around £10 a month more.

The Scotland Act 2012 failed to live up to the Calman Commission's recommendations (we now see many aspects of that report finally making it in to the new act, barely 3 years later). 

The SNP refused to participate in that commission because it was specifically told not to consider independence, despite the ongoing Welsh equivalent of the time doing so. Of course, the SNP submitted a response to the commission and argued for its full implementation, which is not quite as you presented it). 

Despite 2 million people signing a petition for home rule in the latter half of the 40s, it was ignored and kicked into the long grass. That it took the better half of a century to get any traction with either party is not indicative of their being the parties of devolution. As to the Labour's impetus in the 90s, George Robertson said it best, 'to kill nationalism stone dead'; it wasn't for some love of devolutions, as seen by their proposals for further devolution which were the weakest of all the major parties. 

As to the SNP's griping about the legislation to implement the Smith Commission's recommendations, the point was that it was advertised as 'modern home rule', yet Westminster was to have a veto of virtually every aspect of the Scottish Government. (It also leaves it with fewer powers than, say, Catalonia or the Provinces of Canada). The Scottish People wanted more. The SNP wanted more. Why should they not voice their concerns and push for more?

&gt;their aim is to whip up discontent here and hope that the rest of the UK gets so pissed off that it cuts Scotland adrift out of frustration; independence by the back door.

&gt;Regarding blowing from a gun as an old Mogul punishment, the government opted for this technique, as being, relative to death by flogging, more deterrent, more public and more humane.

It was used by the Mughals. I don't understand the hatred for the British Empire - we abolished Slavery and enforced the abolition on the high seas in a way which no other power could. We abolished the horrific practice of _sati_ in India where widows were burned alive.

Essentially the British Empire brought commerce and civilisation to the four corners of the Earth and even the Indians wouldn't rise up against it in WW2 because Nanking showed the barbarism of the Japanese.

True we had some tragic mistakes like the famines and the Boer concentration camps - but these were due to incompetence not malice - unlike the _vernichtungsbefehl_ (Extermination Order) of the German Empire in Africa at around the same time or the disgusting practices of Leopold in the Congo.

Yes Britain executed soldiers for cowardice but so did every Empire - WWI was horrific and if you didn't do that then there would be mass mutiny. 

Ultimately the British Empire did far more good than bad and it is key to judge it by the standards of the day (by which it excelled) - the alternative to the liberal British Empire wasn't a modern democratic nation but an authoritarian German Reich or the supremacist Japanese.",null,0,null,1423560026,null,0,false,0,cogwlc3,null,t3_2vb2pm,null,t1_cogwlc3,null,t1_cogar51,null,null,null,null,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

In particular, the level of economic knowledge amongst the general public is extremely poor - they consistently call for policies which are incredibly unsound (lower taxes and higher spending, for example), which means that there is a good case for looking carefully at whether this law is likely to have unintended consequences of displacing existing social and market norms with government-mandated ones (cf. the Isreali Daycare study that everyone always cites at this point). I think there is good evidence that this could be the case if government interferes with the morality of the market, rather than strictly enforcing morality which we feel strongly enough to build into laws.

You clearly don't mean that laws are just ethics reflected by an elected body. If that were true everything immoral would be illegal and everything illegal would be immoral. Neither of those are the case, so it makes perfect sense to draw a distinction between them. The distinction I am drawing between them here is that there are some unethical things a business can do which are not illegal, and the government should not interfere here (or at least, not generally)

And besides, the question is whether it should be a 'priority'. Even if everything I said above was a complete nonsense, I still feel that defence of the realm, the NHS, the Welfare state and lowering unemployment are bigger priorities, so I would still answer in the negative.",null,0,null,1423561491,null,0,false,0,cogwvf7,null,t3_2vanln,null,t1_cogwvf7,null,t1_cogg5l4,null,null,null,null,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

So the men that were attacked thought they were talking to a 15 year old girl, and sent her indecent images of themselves. How exactly were they tricked into doing this? And how were the men paranoid?

""Bathing Grandma"" is quite often used in the north-east as a way of saying ""getting paid"", e.g. ""I've just bathed Grandma (""I've just been paid"") and I've got some serious spunk (money) to get rid of.""  
  
""Grinding Gravel"" is mainly used in the industrial towns of the north, and is normally used to describe being paid for manual labour.  ""I'm grinding lots of gravel at the moment"" means ""I'm making lots of money by performing manual labour.""  
  
""Raping the Chancellor"" is fairly obscure, but is sometimes used by City traders if they are making lots of money by ""dubious"" means (e.g. dodgy bank deals or insider trading.)

&gt;The ___Grand Turk___ is a three-masted [sixth-rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth-rate) [frigate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigate), designed to represent a generic Nelson-age warship, with her design greatly inspired by HMS *Blandford* (1741). The ship was built in [Marmaris, Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmaris), in 1996 to provide a replica of a frigate for the production of the [ITV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_Network) series adapted from the novels about Royal Navy officer [Horatio Hornblower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornblower_(TV_series\)) by [C. S. Forester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Forester). Nowadays the [tall ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_ship) is used mainly in sailing events, for corporate or private charter, and for receptions in her spacious saloon or on her deck. In 2010 the ship was purchased by the French company Étoile Marine Croisières, based at [Saint-Malo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Malo), [Brittany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany), and since then has been renamed *Étoile du Roy* (""King's Star"").

Does being 15 years old normally stop an un-incarcerated teenager from viewing porn?

So it seems to me that there are three variables:

- Young men in prison come from more violent backgrounds and have shown (on average) more proclivity for violence.
- Young men in prison have less regular contact with the opposite sex
- Young men in prison have less access to porn than those outside.

At least one of there  variables, possibly several, is causing increased offending in their future lives. The article theorises the second. Some people in this thread are pointing to the first.

However, I see no indication whether anyone has considered the third as a possible factor. Is it? Apart from an experiment, I can see no other way to find out.

We made the mistake of using the solicitors and mortgage advisor recommended by the estate agent. The solicitors were slow and useless and the mortgage advisor got us on a rather expensive mortgage. We saved a significant amount by switching a few years later from Halifax to HSBC (although I believe Nationwide are also very good).

The main mistake I think I made was in just listening to the advisor rather than looking around more and getting a better understanding. I think the way to compare is to assume you'll be keeping that mortgage for, say, 5 years and working out the total cost. 

For example, if there's a £1000 fee and it's £500/month then over 5 years you'll pay 1000 + 60 x 500 = 31,000. If another one offers no fee, but £550/month, that would come out at 33,000, which is obviously worse!

Remember to check the number of years the mortgage runs for - the fewer the years, the quicker it gets paid off, meaning the less interest you pay (and the greater the proportion of your payment goes to paying it off), but the higher the monthly payment will be. I calculated that by moving from a 30 year to a 25 year, we knocked about 15k off the overall cost of our mortgage. 

When we remortgaged and I did it properly, I looked at the comparison websites, looked at the bank websites and made a table with all the total 5 year costs, picked the best deal and then arranged a meeting with the mortgage guy at HSBC. We had a couple of meetings, brought in a load of paperwork (payslips, bills, etc I think) and that was it. Apparently it's got a bit more in depth since then and they ask a lot more questions, but I think this is still the best way to do it.

1) Reaction times may get worse, but by how much? An 18 year old with a 20% reaction time impairment is still going to react a LOT faster than an 80 year old on their best day. The study I've seen on this had a very small sample size, and reaction time impairment was inconsistent between individuals.

It's also worth noting that the variation in reaction time between two otherwise similar individuals can also be huge, either because of genetics or because of factors not taken into account in the study, which brings me to point two:

2) Just about everything affects your reaction time. Didn't get a great nights sleep last night? You reaction time will be shot to shit. Got a bit of a cold? Same deal. Got a passenger in the car? Same again. Smoking a cigarette increases reaction time a lot too, especially in the immediate aftermath of smoking when your brain is deprived of oxygen - I doubt they took this into account in the study, either.

3) In practicality I have friends that consume outrageous quantities of cannabis, yet get no worse at playing computer games heavily dependent on reaction times (as well as general dexterity) as they get more stoned throughout the evening.

Think of it like this; the objective of the individual worker is to do as little as possible whilst living the most comfortable life. At the moment the amount of labour required to sustain ones self is somewhere between about 30 and 100 hours a week (depending on where you live in the world).
In they hypothetical stateless, *classless* society technology and innovation would centre around getting labour as close to 0 hours a week as possible.
If there is no labour, markets cannot exist.
The argument that is presented ""do away with markets and money"" isn't an objective, it is the by product of the removal of labour.

This cannot occur under a capitalist system; without the objective to destroy capitalism and have the workers own the capital (capital refers to things we think of as commodities that have the ability to produce other commodities) the objective is not less work but more profit. Since, according to a Marxist definition, profit is the extraction of surplus value the objective of the capitalist is to have their workers producing as much as possible for as little pay as possible (the theory is that this creates a whole bunch of other interesting contradictions in commodity based societies, but that's a side point we don't need to go into).",null,0,null,1423564663,null,0,false,0,cogxgi5,null,t3_2vcuet,null,t1_cogxgi5,null,t1_cogwy5y,null,null,null,null,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

There are few concrete reasons why they would be considered as such, but a lot of their rhetoric seems to be against fuzzy concepts like ""political correctness"" or ""multiculturalism"" that are hard to define, but by being against it they're appealing to people who struggle to deal with hetrogenous or pluralistic society. They believe the struggle is real, that they'd do better in a more homogenous society.

For me thats what makes them appear socially authoritarian.

After a while they all get to know each other and who the best players/drafters etc are, most NA pros have come from NEL. The EU has it's own version called EDL but I don't know if it's as active, EUW's matchmaking is slightly better than NA.

I trust the judge judgement on the nature of the content, there is also this line in the article. 

&gt;a Facebook thread was set up by one of the defendants peddling vehemently anti-Muslim comments.

I believe that is enough to come to a conclusion on the nature of the facebook thread/accounts and who they were targeting. 

&gt;There was a problem in the area with Muslim men targeting young girls. No one has the right to accuse these men of ""exaggerations and paranoia"" after so many cases of Muslim men raping children have come to light over the last couple of years. Its no myth. They fact that many of the men they targeted freely sent indecent images to children, and attempted to meet with children they met over the internet shows you that they had every reason to be ""paranoid"".

It seems like there was a singular problem in the area, centered on a single restaurant. They attacked two men in a car. These men according to the case, did nothing. They then set up an account luring other men and again according to the case did this ""under false pretenses"". 2 men that were lured an attacked, one of them was sikh, the other was muslim. We have no idea what the content of those meets were or if they even revealed their age. So we have 4 victims, not ""many men"", two did nothing besides being muslim in a car (according to the facts and we have have no reason to think otherwise), one was a sikh man and the other a muslim man who were lured under ""false pretenses"" and attacked. The indecent image was sent by the sikh man incidentally. 

Leicester has one of the largest muslim populations in this country. Do you believe if there are a few bad apples, time to throw out the cart? Keep it under scrutiny? That leads to situations like this where you have vigilante gangs attacking muslims out in the open because of some paranoia. And yes, it is paranoia.  I guess thats why the police were praising the community leaders, they must have to deal with a lot of ""why cant we beat up them up, dey raping da kids"".

Compare the situation of Sterling's to Harry Kane. 

I would look at Harry Kane's deal as similar to Sterlings in 2012. Sterling is on 30/35k and Kane is on 40k.

They've come up from the academy played well in their first year and got a pay rise to reflect that. 

What if Kane, who'll be 22 next year, continues his form. It would only be logical to give him another pay rise even doubling his wage to 80k maybe even more at 100k, because if his production for the team both on and off the pitch continues he'll be worth alot more than 40k. 

As of right now this is Sterling's second full season and no one could argue that he isn't an important member of the team both on and off the pitch. It doesn't matter that he's 20 years old because this is the position the club put themselves in. 

The club could've gone big in the summer and bought an experienced class player but they chose not to, Sturridge went down somebody had to step up and even with the way the season has gone Sterling has still been one of our best players. 

What if we do qualify for the top 4 and the club has the option to spend again, would you be happy to see some player who hasn't even made a significant contribution to the team waltz in as one of the highest paid players, I know i wouldn't.

&gt;*UPDATE: No 10 has categorically denied that they have any plans to hold a referendum in 2016. Senior officials insist up to two years will be needed to secure a successful renegotiation with the other EU countries.*

 [Hold early EU referendum, BCC chief tells Cameron](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-31328228)

&gt;*""The next government must set out what it will do to protect the United Kingdom against the prospect of being in a club where all the decisions are made by, and for, the eurozone.*

&gt;*""More than any repatriation of powers, businesses want to know that the UK has safeguards against being drawn closer to the eurozone - especially as history tells us that currency unions inevitably fall apart unless there is real political, economic and social integration.""*

This means the EU will require a NEW TREATY (FISCAL/BUDGETARY) post-2017 more likely 2020.

If so, then the Referendum needs to factor in a CLEAR CHOICE either way for the Electoral Commission to be serving it's public duty with integrity:-

* IN = Ever Closer Union + sign New Treaty of EU for Fiscal Integration and Federalization politically
* OUT = Exit the Political (ever closer) Union and re-enter Efta/EEA Treaty with access to Single Market

If political Influence is such a big deal then not being an EZ-member atst as the New Fiscal Treaty will mean that argument is irrelevant. But then it already is irrelevant according to quantified Political Influence in the current EU Institutions:-


1.    UK Percentage of the Vote in the Council of Ministers under QMV = 8.2% (down from 17 in 1973)
2.    The Number and UK Percentage of the Vote in the European Parliament = 73/751 ; (down from 19%-9.7%)
3.    Number and Percentage of UK appointed Commissioners = 1 (down from 2), 3.6 (%)

And these measures are merely headline figures, the tip of the ice-berg of lack of influence in current EU Institutions.

Further on reporting by the BBC:-

Due to Lisbon Treaty the Treaties allow a **Self-Amending Legislative** process which mean loss of powers (policies)/Sovereignty occurs DAILY and continuously: It's not a discrete event anymore as it was per major Treaty change that did not allow a single Referendum x7 from Single European Act early 80's through EURO, EU Constitution to the last Treaty: Lisbon.

[List of Lies of Referendum Promises](http://www.brugesgroup.com/mediacentre/quotes.live) for reminder

&gt;*Labour has said it will only sanction a referendum if further powers are handed from the UK to Brussels requiring a fundamental change to existing treaties.*

&gt;*A Liberal Democrat source said that it was not opposed to a referendum in principle but said it should only happen if significant powers were transferred and that its commitment to remaining in the EU ""is what most businesses want and what the BCC wants"".*

A useful reminder of how USELESS our political leaders are:-

1. A Referendum is Impossible!
2. A Referendum is possible but not necessary!
3. We said and knew a Referendum was necessary and possible all along.

And here we have the uselessness equally as well as the lies and broken promises of the politicians going on for &gt;25+ years.


=

But the real essence of this story despite official repudiation is:-

* Economic FUD Uncertainty = Speed up having a referendum!
* Required time to negotiation and reform a real referendum!

Both are blatantly false and attempting to manipulate the framing of the timing of 2017 for a referendum instead of:-

* 2017 = False Choice (Top-Down) Referendum on Article 48 vs Brexit
* 2020 = Real Choice (Bottom-Up) Referendum on Fiscal New Treaty vs Article 50 Brexit

This echoes the trickery and treachery (treason) of:-

* 1972 European Communities Act membership to the EEC
* 1975 Post-Legislative Referendum on **staying in Common Market** not Ever Closer Union.

Separating the 2 Real Choices (**by timing differences and hence emphasis differences**): The EU Ever Closer Union from Single Market the aspect that is necessary and possible without Ever CLoser Union and Political Union of the EU Institutions to overrule British Institutions via **Efta/EEA** membership instead via the legal route of secession = Article 50 TEU Lisbon Treaty.",null,0,null,1423566664,null,0,false,0,cogxtuo,null,t3_2vehox,null,t1_cogxtuo,null,t3_2vehox,null,null,null,null,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

[EU politics: Germany in stasis](http://www.eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=85431)

&gt;*The new movement, ""Direct Democracy for Europe"", Patzelt speaks about favourably. It certainly has ""a chance"", he says, a man who is demonstrably no great fan of representative democracy.*

&gt;*Those who want more democracy must resort to other means - referendums initiated by citizens, regardless of elections. The problem with representative democracy is that, after the vote, the citizen has no voice. ""The most important instrument of political influence between elections"", he says, ""is the referendum"".*

&gt;**However, not all referendums have the same value. If they are top down, they are a tool in the hands of professional politicians. The must work from the bottom up, with citizens deciding on the topics**. *He who fails to make this distinction will miss the opportunity of making a truly democratic system of government, Patzelt says.*

Oh but it's still wrong to treat them as different you say? Well, first and foremost, the Howard League look at men and women in prison and their own tag line is ""Less crime, safer communities, fewer people in prison"":

But, if you still want to complain about women getting special treatment,  the issues in Female prisons are different to those in Male prisons/.

There are unique issues for incarcerating women including them being more likely to be sexually victimised by prison officers, more likely to have a history of abuse, more likely to have been the victim of abuse in the past and more likely to be a sole carer:

http://www.howardleague.org/publications-women/

In addition, the female prison population is about 1/20th the size of the male prison population so the issues unique to their incarceration are likely to be drowned out if we simply average out both groups.

Shouldn't be too hard. THC is readily dissolved in fat and alcohol. So potentially gargling with full fat milk would help quite a bit. Alternatively an alcohol based mouth wash might work quite well.

Allardyce responded with classic quotes like ""I don't give a shit what he says"" and ""We out-tactic'd him! He can't take it can he!?"".

He was obviously sacked for being a bad manager with QPR looking to be relegated, but the official explanation was the he'd have to have ""knee surgery"". So that's why the joke about him selling his knee to Kolo.

It may not be possible to close the account with a negative balance in place or fees owing.  Once the fees are taken off you'll be in the unauthorised overdraft again, which will attract more fees, and so on like the proverbial snowball.

Even if they do let you close the account that doesn't alter the fact that from their POV the fees are owed and they can, and probably will, chase you possibly up to the point of taking court action which again is likely to increase the amount you owe and may have long term effects on your credit rating.  The ostrich approach is unlikely to work here.

It is worth checking that the charges are correct - it's not obvious from your post why you're getting the second set of charges if you were only in the overdraft briefly, unless the £30 pushed you over the edge again.

The low wages thing is a [myth](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/8414447/How-UK-incomes-have-risen-and-fallen-since-1948.html)

&gt; As such, it's become the norm for working class families to have both parents working.

As I said earlier, it's always been the norm for working-class families to have both parents working. The difference is, the female parent usually earnt less and was restricted to woman's work, such as domestic work, sewing, laundry, and sometimes shop-work as the UK entered the 20th century and chain shops became more prolific etc. 

It wasn't just working-class women that worked; unmarried middle-class women often worked, usually in education, as governesses or school teachers.

Well the only poll that matters is the one on the day as they say, but that won't stop people making predictions before then. Historically, the polls in the year leading up to the election are pretty good indicators of how it turns out (since 1992 at least) - the closer to the election the more accurate the polls become at predicting the final result, having the cut off at one month is arbitrary though.

&gt; ""It has been reported in a small number of controlled studies in the 1980s that THC can be detected in blood after passive exposure to cannabis smoke. However, modern analytical methods suggest that due to the rapid distribution of THC in the body, which also occurs after passive exposure to low doses, the THC concentration in serum after exposure would be less than 1 μg/L within an hour, whilst similar and very low serum concentrations of THC carboxylic acid would also be observed (&lt; 2 μg/L). Higher blood concentrations were suggested as commensurate with the deliberate consumption of a psychoactive dose (Toennes, Röhrich&amp; Wunder, 2010).""
  
...  
  
&gt; ""The plasma elimination half‐life (the time taken for the concentration of a drug in blood to reduce by half) is used to estimate how long a drug takes to leave the body, and is usually calculated as five times the half‐life (Roland and Tozer, 2006 ). The half-life (t½) of THC is marginally different for regular/frequent users and infrequent users of cannabis. For frequent users, t½ is about 2 hours and in infrequent users about 1.5 hours respectively (Moffat et al, 2004): nabilone, synthetic THC (t½) was also about 2 hours (Karschner, Eugene, Schwilke, 2011). Thus for the purposes of drug analysis the window of opportunity for the detection of THC after a single dose would be quite narrow and less than 9 to 12 hours.""  
  
...  
  
&gt; ""In heavy long term users (daily or near daily use over a number of years) variable rates of release of THC from tissue stores during abstinence have been reported. A mean THC blood concentration after 24 hours abstinence was found to be 0.7 μg/L (SD 1.4 μg/L) and after 7 days abstinence 0.3 μg/L (SD 0.7 μg/L) (Karschner, Eugene&amp; Schwilke, 2011), whereas in regular/frequent users blood concentrations of THC were detected between 1 μg/L and 6.4 μg/L. Smoking a single cannabis cigarette (infrequent user) leads to higher concentrations of THC in the body, ranging from 3 μg/L – 12 μg/L, and maximal THC blood concentrations after oral consumption were found to be in the range of 4.4μg/L to 11.0 μg/L following a single 20 mg dose (Ohlsson, Lindgren&amp; Wahlen, 1980; Karschner, Eugene&amp; Schwilke, 2011): oral administration of a 2 mg dose of radio‐labelled nabilone in comparison, achieved peak plasma concentrations of approximately 2 μg/L nabilone within 2.0 hours. However, it is known that plasma concentrations of THC are higher than those found in whole blood (see overleaf).A comprehensive review of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of cannabis has been conducted by Grotenhermen, Leson&amp; Berghaus (2007).""  
  
...    
  
&gt; ""if a blood sample is collected from a subject who has recently used cannabis and the sample is split into two portions, one being analysed as whole blood and the other centrifuged to prepare plasma analysis, then the concentration of THC, the main active component of cannabis will be about 2 times greater in the plasma sample than in the whole blood sample. For this reason whole blood was considered to be the most appropriate biological fluid for setting thresholds because it relates best to the scientific evidence in relation to driving. Therefore whole blood will be recommended as the biological sample of choice. In addition, THC has a rapid metabolism, and if the time between the stop or accident and the blood sampling is delayed, the blood concentration may have decreased markedly (based on a half‐life for THC of 1.5 hours). For instance, 5 μg/L of THC will be expected to decrease to 1.25 μg/L after 3 hours.

Most schools will have been built before cars were the norm, most round me are in small residential streets. It would have been a time when the Mother generally did not work so could take the kids to school. Roads were quieter, parking was easier. Now people have busier lives, might have both parents in work, they might live further away from school or have kids in multiple places. Roads can be gridlock even before you add in school traffic.

You have a point that it is not unforseeable that people will drop their kids off at school. Even if you took every single case and everyone who could walk to school did, you would still have chaos as everyone is trying to drop them off at the same time. It is inevitable. People in this thread are acting like there was a halcyon age when they all walked to school and that everything is the same now except kids are lazy and parents are entitled. There is an element of that, but it is not the root cause. Even if it is some kind of scheme where kids are dropped off somewhere nearby and are marshalled by teachers to get to the school gates, there has to be some solution. Or staggering start times.

null,false,Aygers,lfc99,,null,"I wish someone would ask if we are happy with our owners, the Fenway Sports Group. They're the ones mapping out this club strategy and the reason Rodgers got the job in the first place. It started off very shaky with FSG, Hodgson and then Dalglish ... all of those failed transfers ... Comolli and the manager paying the price of failure to reach CL and consequently FSG casting the net wider to find their new man. Enter Rodgers.

I often found Brendan Rodgers frustrating, this season as well in the first part of it. Forcing things and sticking with them for what felt was too long. Everyone has been somewhat pleased with him recently but let's be honest, after last season and all the summer investment we were hungry for a lot more. Still it's tough to see how the past three seasons could have gone better, maybe only the order could have been changed a little. First season as it was, the current season could be the 2nd year of BR's reign and last season the one we'd be experiencing right now. As it is it feels like our club achieved too much in too short a space of time. As ridiculous as it sounds, you have to consider just how far away from the top of the table we were in the final years or Benitez, under Hodgson and even during Kenny's time. The club's finances were apparently a mess as well.

The current season was always always always going to be tougher than the 13/14 one. It's no longer a surprise just how well Liverpool can play through their games. There's a lot less time to prepare the team for the next match. The signings the club has made either needed time to settle or haven't worked out. There's even been injuries and dramatic loss of form.  All in all enough to induce setbacks at any club.

Rodgers has done a lot for Liverpool, he's returned some of the prestige this club has lost during the dark times of H&amp;G. The signings that were made seem to be very influenced by the owners strategy and therefore it's tough to place criticism for them only on Rodgers. There's been a couple of bleak periods during BR's reign and he was able to respond well in those challenges. If it's well enough that's another matter. It seems to me that the club is set up well for the next few seasons. Next year's team needs maybe one or two additions, otherwise everything is in place to mount a better challenge for the top spots. All in all I'm pleased with what Rodgers was able to do but I really do feel the unexpected success of last season has thrown everyone off their game. Liverpool came close to picking up the prize we've been missing the most. Instead of building on that with proven players the decision was made to stick with the original strategy and invest players who's value is very likely to increase, rather to invest in one or two who'd spend their best years here and not yield the financial returns.

Overall it's been a positive period under Rodgers. FSG did well to pick him. At the same time though I put a lot more responsibility for this season to those who created the long term strategy for this club and who pick the decisions on the board/ownership level. Sadly FSG lacked the experience to come into the club and pick the best decisions right away. It's reasonable, even if they are doing a great job with the Red Sox (or so I hear). The bright side to that is that everyone is learning and improving. The environment has been stable and there's no sign of any distress similar to the final months and weeks of the H&amp;G period. 

It was a good decision to pick Rodgers as manager. However there were quite a few poor decisions being made by those who appointed him. They should face the responsibility and criticism. Hopefully that'll keep them motivated to keep improving and evolving and then we might finally win that which has eluded Liverpool for too long in recent history.",null,0,null,1423572666,null,0,false,0,cogz6hs,null,t3_2ves7v,null,t1_cogz6hs,null,t3_2ves7v,null,null,null,null,null,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11,null

That's the tl;dr

Just to elaborate as it'd be annoying to be dismissed without explanation:

If you play 110+ hours in 2 weeks but your mmr hasn't improved despite your skill improving quite a bit, then perhaps the mmr is more accurate than you think. Bare in mind I'm not saying this to put you down- I'm not one to refuse someone a trial based on mmr, but the attitude towards it would put me off more than the mmr itself if I was making a team. Everyone gets feeders, abandons and the team making mistakes - making out like it's preventing your mmr from rising despite your skill isn't a good attitude; others have managed. I've nothing to blame for my own rating other than my own play if we're talking solo mmr. Luck can only account for a small variance, not the overall correleation or therein lack of.  
Best of luck finding a team, I'm just trying to encourage a more positive perspective. If you have that much time to play then having that dedication go to waste due to approach is a shame. The dedication alone is enough for people to consider you for a team I'd imagine, so no harm done here.  
Last point; if you acknowledge 70% of players value mmr (rough percentage) then surely playing specific heroes to raise your mmr to where you believe it should be is in your interest in finding a team fit for your skill? If so, with that many hours, why haven't you already done it to play at your rank? It would enable more opportunity for a good team from that oh-so closed minded group that value mmr.",null,0,null,1423572830,null,0,false,0,cogz83i,null,t3_2vcb4j,null,t1_cogz83i,null,t1_cogyi7y,null,null,null,null,null,1,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,1,null

I bank with Nationwide primarily, but wanted the perks of a Santander 123. Rather than switch (and therefore close) my main flex direct account, I created a sacrifical flex account, switched (internally) two direct debits and then toddled off to Santander a week or two later.

Something, somewhere went awry - the direct debits didn't transfer properly. I rang Santander and was told that Nationwide had refused to switch (which I *think* is illegal, not sure). I figure more likely was that Santander had tried to switch them away from the temporary account before they'd been set up properly.

Anyway, I moaned to Nationwide that they had cost me ~£30 in interest and ~£20 in cashback because I hadn't met the conditions of the (paid for!) account for that month and despite them having no records of the account (because ""it was closed"") they said my story made sense and the timeline of my visits in branch all worked out so they compensated me £75 to make up for the loss and with a goodwill gesture.

null,false,IxionS3,null,null,null,"Train ticketing in the UK is incredibly opaque and complicated and in some cases expensive compared to the situation AIUI in much of continental Europe.

One big variable is how far in advance you're prepared to book.  Take your example of London to Liverpool - from a quick look if I were to rock up at London Euston right now wanting to go to Liverpool, the cheapest single ticket I could buy is over £80.

On the other hand I could book a ticket for the same train in 2 weeks time for £20.  If I wanted to book for the end of April the same train is £15 (both of those are inflexible - I'd be committed to that train alone).

Another factor is that returns can cost little more than a single.  Going back to travelling today, it would cost me little more (or even in one combination less) to buy a return journey than it would to buy the single.

There's also various craziness related to the fact that pricing is not in any way tied to distance or any other obvious metric.  It can be, and often is, cheaper to break a journey up into segments and buy tickets for each segment rather than buy a single ticket for the whole journey.  There are websites dedicated to helping you find the best combination of tickets for your trip!

As to why, a big factor is the structure of the UK rail industry.  The infrastructure is publicly owned but the trains are operated largely by private companies, who are often in competition with each other on the same or similar routes.  This leads to whole smorgasbord of restricted tickets, special offers and so on.

There's also a level of supply and demand - despite the relatively high cost the trains here are still full in many cases, so why charge less?  For an individual travelling alone the cost of train tickets, especially if booked in advance is still competitive or well below the cost of driving (and of course not everyone has a car by a long way).  The other main alternative is long-haul coach travel, which can be cheaper but is also generally slower and less comfortable so tends to be favoured by the more budget conscious.",null,0,null,1423573578,null,0,false,0,cogzfiy,null,t3_2vethg,null,t1_cogzfiy,null,t3_2vethg,null,null,null,null,null,33,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,33,null

Did you even read the fucking wikipedia page?

**HUN**

Hun, Huns or the Hun are used in and, particularly among Northern Irish Nationalist communities. It is used mostly to describe Northern Ireland Protestants, but can refer to British people in general or English people specifically.

**Pommy**

The terms pommy, pommie and pom, in Australia and New Zealand usually denotes an English person (or, less commonly, people from other parts of the UK).

**Sassenach**

Used to describe the English, by their immediate Gaelic-speaking neighbours: the Scots, the Irish and the Manx.

**Sows**

The Cornish word for an Englishman is ""Sows"", and the Cornish word for the English language is ""Sowsnek"". These are also from the Old English term ""Seaxon~Saxon"" ""Saxon"".

**Saeson**

In Welsh, Saeson (singular: Sais) – from the Latin Saxones / Saxo and a reference, as in other Celtic tongues, to the Saxons – means English people (or sometimes simply English-speakers).

&gt; His point is that the English will refer to the Scots as ""Porridge Wogs""

I have never even heard of that term before. I'm not saying it isn't used but your assertion that **NO SCOTTISH PERSON IN THE WHOLE OF SCOTLAND HAS EVER BEEN RACIST TO THE ENGLISH** is one of the most naive and down right ignorant things i have ever heard.

&gt; and similar but the Scots don't refer to the English by any similar terms

Well thats bullshit. There are Scottish people that are racist towards English people just as their are English people that are racist towards Scottish people. Please stop playing the victim.

&gt; Well except for possibly ""sassenach"" in the Gaelic rural areas.

Exactly. Jesus christ the mental gymnastics you have to go through to keep to this narrative of ""English people are mean to Welsh/Scots/Irish and we never say or do anything"" is crazy.

[Ship on the Shore](http://www.theshipontheshore.co.uk). Some of the best sea food coupled with atmosphere you will get in the Leith area where you can walk in off the street and usually get away without booking.  If they are doing scallops, get them.

[Cafe Marlayne](http://www.cafemarlayne.com).  This place has two restaurants; one on Thistle street which is tiny, and one opposite the Playhouse which is much larger.  Always extremely satisfying and delicious French cuisine at affordable prices, trendy and no need to book for lunch.

[Tangs Gohan](http://tangsgohan.com/). Between here and Bonsai you can't get better Japanese food in Edinburgh.  Sashimi is extremely fresh and exquisitely arranged, with a number of traditional Japanese favourites on the menu such as udon soup or yakitori.  I recommend Chicken teriyaki.  Atmosphere is relaxed but elegant, with friendly staff.

[Cafe Andamiro](https://www.facebook.com/andamirocafe).  Korean / Japanese food.  Quite basic and simple inside, however look around and you'll see many an Asian face looking back at you, testament to the amazing quality of food.  Best Korean I've had in Edinburgh, and close to the Meadows which is nice to walk though back to the city.

If you are in the city centre and in a fix, starving and the rain is lashing down, head into [Amarone](http://www.amaronerestaurant.co.uk/) on St Andrews square.

You'll need to bring some serious hardware to break in though - the armoury at my old base was essentially a giant safe, so you'd need to cut through it somehow. 

Also, shooting clubs - I sometimes go clay pigeon shooting with friends who hold shotgun licences, and those places often have a shop selling shotguns and ammo, and the security is pretty loose. 

Getting hold of a firearm would probably be too difficult for most ordinary citizens. If you want something lethal for personal defence I would guess the following might be better options

Bow and arrow - a modern compound bow will give you plenty of range and stopping power, although you'll need to practice to get your accuracy to a good standard. Also, probably not that easy to find unless you know where to look. Advantage of a bow over a crossbow is that with practice you'll be able to fire off a lot of arrows fairly quickly, I believe crossbows are slower to reload. 

Blunt weapon - a baseball bat might seem like the obvious option, but I'd suggest something like a crowbar might be better, because it's much harder and heavier, you can do a lot more damage with hard steel than wood. Also bear in mind that you might need to swing it in an enclosed space, so perhaps you want a cosh as well - you won't have the reach, but it'll be more usable in tight corridors. 

Bladed weapon - again, might seem like a good option, and probably looks very intimidating, but I think you need more skill to use a knife well. A good metal bar will probably be your best option.

My peers are either disengaged with politics, or were fed horror stories of evil Thatcher when they were young. I think this ‘Nasty Party’ sentiment is still rife and it’s ‘cool’ to hate the tories, I certainly don’t agree with them on every policy, but they’re the most sensible and therefore credible of the options we have.

Part of me hopes for a conservative/labour coalition, as that will be not only be the most representative but it should break apart this 2 party system we currently have.

The political system we have stinks, but I’m not the type to go all Russel Brand about it. I will participate and vote for what I think is best at each opportunity I am given.

With that said, the global economic system MUST fail before we can make any real progress, the largest elephant in the room that no-one dares think about.

Good chance that TA members went for the guns upon the outbreak and if they didn't survive, they likely would have left the safe open (though could have been looted by others if this is the case, hopefully I can manage to kill a bunch of TA zombies - hope they have no riot gear on).

But I wouldn't bother with an urban police force, I can't imagine it not being overrun in the large parts of cities, though I imagine that even the smallest police stations at least have a pistol or two?

The latter. A lot of UK industry was nationalised during and after WWII, including the railways.  The Conservative government that held power in the UK through the 80s and early 90s had a policy of privatising large chunks of it.  This included utilities (gas, electricity, water, telecoms), steel and coal and transport.  Eventually they got around to the railways.

It's the 'expenses' that are the grey area - you get reimbursed for them before you pay income tax.  My main office is my home, so I could legitimately claim gas, electricity, water, etc as expenses because these are things that you need as a business.  I'm working with someone where they want me to go to their office every day - so in theory I could claim for lunches, coffees, etc.  I could go out for a couple of beers after work with the people I'm working with and claim that as expenses.  I could put suits, shirts and shoes on expenses. I could buy myself toys and trinkets that I use for my job and claim them as expenses. (I don't do any of these things)

It's not unheard of for people to claim extensions on their houses as business expenses.

I could put a family member who doesn't have a job as one of shareholders and then pay out dividends to both of us, so that we both get our personal allowances. eg if my other half didn't work I could make her as a 50% owner of the business and then between us we could get the full dividends, but split between two people's personal tax limits.  

I could employ her as a part time worker and then pay huge amounts into pension funds (you can claim back 100% of your earnings in income tax refunds).  I could pay myself huge amounts in pension funds.

If you're lucky, there'll be such a cheap ticket, but sometimes you can look a month, two months, or sometimes even more in advance and you won't get it any cheaper at all.

If you want to go on the weekend (ie, leave Friday, return Sunday) you're *much* less likely to find a cheap ticket than if you want to travel on an unpopular day.

There are also 'off-peak' and 'on-peak' times. Tickets are more expensive if you're travelling during the rush hour - but often there's no indication of *when that actually is*, and it can vary across train operators and routes.

There are other bees in the bonnet too with things like pension rates being increased, though I will concede that public sector pensions still comfortable exceed those in the private sector - but that alone isn't justification for further pay restraint.

Migs,
Lovren, Skrtel, Sakho
Ibe, Can, Hendo, Moreno
Coutinho
Balo, Studge

Slight change, going two up top. You can't drop Ibe after being MOTM. Sterling a knock has been confirmed. If Coutinho does have a knock too then either Lallana or Markovic could replace him in there. Skrtel stays centre because he drops deep and plays more of a sweeper like he has done, whereas the other two push forward towards attacks more, plus they're more comfortable on the ball. Can is better than Allen, simples. 

However I think that BR will more likely play this:

Migs,
Can, Skrtel, Sakho
Manquillo, Allen, Hendo, Moreno
Lallana, Coutinho
Studge

If Studge isn't fit enough I wouldn't be surprised to see Ibe upfront, or even Markovic - for pace in behind. If Coutinho or Lallana aren't fit/have a knock then Markovic or Ibe could be there.

Also it rose at a higher rate than private sector pay for most of the New Labour years and so had further to deflate. 

&gt; Most public sector workers (those that still actually have their jobs that is) have seen their pay fall by about 15% compared to pre-crisis levels.

Citation needed. 

&gt; public sector workers have also seen their workloads increased dramatically as part of a push for ""efficiency savings"". It means we are working much harder for less money.

Restoring the balance more evenly with the private sector. Having worked in both public and private sector myself this is a good thing (without getting on to the pensions/retirement comparison).

My understanding of the MAS tool is that it helps you calculate how much to put into your pension, based on the amount you will need to live on when you are retired.

When you say that pensions are political and subject to change, this means the state pension, but not other pensions right?

This means that, if you believe that the state pension amount you will receive will be less than the tool predicts (perhaps because it becomes means-tested), your pensions contribution ought to be higher in order to account for this.

OP: The results from the tool match advice I have read elsewhere on pensions. You may want to check out the [Money Saving Expert](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/discount-pensions) page on retirement saving.

&gt;

&gt;___Noel's House Party___ is a [BBC television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_television) [light entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_entertainment) show hosted by [Noel Edmonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Edmonds) that was broadcast live on Saturday evenings during the 1990s. It was set in a large house in the fictional village of Crinkley Bottom, leading to much [innuendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innuendo). The show was broadcast during the autumn-spring season (October/November to March). In 2010, Noel's House Party was voted the best Saturday night TV show of all time.

It's rich in α-amanitin and β-amanitin, chemicals that block the RNA polymerase II, an enzyme used in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and snRNA. mRNA synthesis is essential to protein synthesis, and protein synthesis is essential to cell metabolism. Blocking the enzymes kills the cells in your body. Initially you'll get stomach-ache, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. A few days later you'll feel fine. At this point you have irreversible liver-damage and will require a liver transplant. If you don't get one you will die. There is no known antidote.

I had started playing, and as I began watching games on TV, I saw Frank Lampard. I fell in love with his style of play and he became an instant role model. I have a poster of him in my room, I think 4 different jerseys with ""Lampard 8"" on the back, his autograph, and I've been a huge fan of him since I first watched him play. I remember when Mourinho went to Inter Milan I read a bunch of transfer rumors about Lampard following him to Italy. I was crushed. I wrote a letter to Frank, and he probably never read it, but I believe I played my part. I moved back to the US and Chelsea kept getting bigger and better and I just kept watching. I was able to make it to the Bridge for two games, one against Fulham back when they had Brian McBride, and one against Man City when they had Robinho. My uncle's company had season tickets so both times I visited I got to see a game, I was very lucky. I watch every Saturday morning, and I rush home from school (which is half an hour away) to watch us when we play Champions League. 

When Lampard left I was crushed. I was terrified of the day my favorite player would no longer play for Chelsea. Whether he went to Man City or NYCFC, I was just crushed when I realized he would be playing for somebody other than Chelsea. When that other team ended up being City, I was so mad at first. I felt like he betrayed me. Then he scored on us, and I was devastated. I sat there watching wide eyed, jaw dropped, and a single tear rolled down my cheek. 

When there was that whole fiasco about him extending his stay in Manchester or whatever, I realized something. I realized that no matter what, Frank is my role model. He's a god damn professional. He does what he needs to in order to support his family and stay in top condition. Playing for City is so hard for him, but he does it. He grinds through the work. I find that incredibly admirable. I also realized how lucky we were to have him for such a long time, and we were so lucky to have a player of his class and ability at Chelsea. Chelsea is the club in his heart. Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.

My company is 100% owned by me, so yes I do act as my shareholders require me to.  

The law does not state that you have to act in their best interests, just that you have to act on behalf of them.  If the shareholders say that you should pay tax as required by the spirit of the law rather than the letter of it, then you do so, even if it provides them with less in dividends.  If the shareholders say that you should sack the entire staff and replace them with a tea trolley and a small albino dog, then you do so.

&gt; My point is that we should not want it to be left up to international companies to interpret the reason we have taxes. 

I agree - I think that it should be up to the government to close loopholes so that they pay what they should.

However a multi-national company floated on the stock market will always look to maximise profits because its shareholders are a series of investment bankers and pension funds.  So if consumers only buy from ethical companies, it will be more profitable for them to be more ethical.  

You can't blame the system when we're part of it.  If we stop buying stuff from companies that use tax loopholes to the point where no longer becomes profitable for them to use the tax loopholes, they'll stop using them.  This capitalistic system works two ways.

&gt; It is the responsibility of politicians to do that and then up to HMRC to make rigorous rules to apply that interpretation.

This is the crux of the argument.  HMRC do not rigorous rules to apply that interpretation.  They apply rules to one group of people who can't afford to fight them in court and another set for those that can.

And also Which? : http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/problem/the-second-hand--car-i-bought-has-a-problem-what-are-my-rights

Short of it is that the Sale of Goods Act still applies, and to quote from the AA's page, it must be:
&gt; * Of satisfactory quality
&gt; * Fit for purpose, and
&gt; * As described

&gt; The dealer must have the right to sell the vehicle and is legally obliged to sort out the problem if it fails to meet these basic requirements.

&gt; Satisfactory quality means that the vehicle should be of a standard a reasonable person would expect, taking into account factors such as: age, value, history, mileage, make, durability, safety and description.  An old car with high mileage would not be expected to be as good as a younger car with low mileage but each should still be roadworthy, reliable, and in a condition consistent with its age/price.

&gt; The dealer is liable for faults with the vehicle - that mean it was not of satisfactory quality - that were present at the time it was sold even though they may only become apparent later on.

From the Which? link,
&gt; **Returning a second hand car**

&gt; If there's a problem with a second hand car soon after you've bought it, for example, the car develops a problem you wouldn't expect for the car's age and mileage, or it turns out not to be what you’d been led to expect, you may have the right to reject and return the car and get your money back.

""**Patrick, how much are you looking forward to facing arsenal after man city?**

We've been focused on the league, so we've been trying not to think about it, but we'll go out there with confidence. They've hit form and have all their best players available, which makes it even more exciting. It's more incentive(?) to beat them!

**Your strike partner Lee Tomlin tweeted that Vincent Kompany fell out of his pocket when he did his washing. Did the rest of the defence fall out of yours?**

Ha ha. I can't believe Lee put that up on Twitter; all the lads gave him stick about it. But it was a good team effort so I don't think you can pick out any individual performance.

**A lot has been made about the Bon Jovi concert you went to at the Etihad stadium before that game. Have you been to any concerts at the Emirates?**

The last time I was at the Emirates was to see Chelsea play Arsenal in the Capital One Cup and we won two-nil so hopefully that's a good omen.

**Is it true you're fluent in german and french, and will you be using that to wind up Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny?**

My french is good enough to get by living in France and I can pick out the odd few words in German. But in terms of winding up defenders, that's not my style. I'll give as good as I get if they niggle at me but I prefer having a a laugh to all the real agry bargy.

**Do you ever regret turning down a place at Harvard?**

I applied to a few universities in America just in case things didn't work out in football and I got offered a place at Harvard to study business. It was always a back-up option, but since I've started football professionally I've never looked back.

**You and Frank Lampard are widely regarded as two of the smartest footballers? Did you ever discuss quantum cosmology at Chelsea?**

We never really had those conversations, believe it or not. One player who is seriously clever at Chelsea, though, is Peter Cech - he even looks clever. Footballers often get labelled as not being too smart, but a lot of players nowadays speak two or three languages, which is no mean feat(?).

**How dishearting was it seeing the likes of Diego Costa, Loic Remy and Didier Drogba getting brought in at Chelsea when you were still trying to break into the side?**

In my mind I'm still developing, so I'm not expecting to get thrown in right away. Chelsea are one of the top teams in the world so they need to be winning things. Brining in a striker like Diego Costa makes that possible. Hopefully in a year or two I'll be ready to step in and help lead the line.

**Training with these guys must have been interesting...**

I used to watch and learn so much from them - especially with Costa, there's such a lot to learn. I was actually speaking to the coaches at Boro just the other day about how he uses his body to shield up the ball. I try and pick up bits from all the top players.

**Does the fact that you also took Liverpool to penalties in the Capital One Cup prove Boro are ready for the Premier League?**

I think it's shown that we can come up against those kinds of teams and compete. You always got upsets in the cup, but with the Liverpool performance it shows it wasn't a fluke. Hopefully we can do it again at Arsenal.

**So would you rather go all the way in the Cup or get into one of the automatic promotion spots?**

In the best of both worlds you'd obviously want both, but I think the most important thing for this club is to get into those automatic promotion spots.

My suggestions go a lot further than more regulations :) 

Though I snark about the news, in honesty I think all the banking and political problems are symptoms of something much, much deeper. 

All these regulations are just sticking plasters. Patch one hole and a clever elite will find a new way to make money. Because the real problem is unequal access to resources. That is the foundation of all inequality. 

How would I solve unequal access to resources? With a single change: ban all taxation. Replace it with ground rents. You use a natural resource? The pay society its worth. Simple. As Adam Smith said, ground rents are the best way to fund society.

I have a web page on how that would solve not just our economic problems, but our political ones as well.

There *are* such things as moral absolutes and its worthy to both search for them and uphold them.

And there *are* universal available criteria on this - in democracies (and before you start, no democracy is perfect - all have elements of gerrymandering, witness USA electoral districts, Scottish over-representantion in Westminster, over-representation and under-representation of certain professions, social classes, genders and religions in assemblies throughout the western world), political change should be achieved through discourse, reasoned argument, ballot box initiatives, dialogue, and peaceful forms of protest.

That was hardly even tested in Northern Ireland before old Republican wives tales were dug up and used to excuse a fresh attempt at a long failed tactic. The Civil Rights Association was formed in 1967. Abandoned by the Republican movement (if it was ever even embraced - I'm not sure that it was) in less than two years, even when plenty of high placed unionists were already indicating willingness to move on NICRA's demands, and the British Government was pushing heavily on the Stormont administration to move faster. A pathetic level of patience. Truth was there were at least some itching for an excuse to take a violent path.

The criteria applies to Donestk 'rebels', Basque separatists, Scandanavian anti-immigration campaigners, Parisian Banlieue dwellers of Algerian-origin and Islamic literalists as it does to Flemish and Breton separatists, German Pirate Party activists, the Italian Northern League, True Finns, Scottish nationalists... and the Irish Republican movement.

This is a scale from dota2toplist, that shows how my mmr has been in the last 2 weeks (hope it works) - http://i.imgur.com/V9VgdnQ.png

I didn't mean it as it was preventing me, I just meant that these things build up in games and can cause a loss when it could be an easy to a try-hard win (such as a game I just played, a magnus wasn't using his RP properly and ended up rping an illusion just before a big teamfight which may have won us the game if he didn't use it at that time or used it a lot more in the game to lockdown one of their carries, and I messed up at the end (we all make mistakes :P), i played witch doctor activated my ult but activated my bkb at same time which stopped my ult but it didn't actually matter since their sniper just flattened out throne.) I do try to win every game but when you know you should of won the game but can see the mistakes that prevented it, then its becomes harder to raise your MMR (even with practice and fixing your own mistakes).

Thank you, I do understand that and I appreciate it. Yeah I'm trying my best to practice more, I guess the best thing to do would try to climb MMR and try to join some IHL's. Yeah hopefully my dedication will prevail :D.

I acknowledge a lot of people value MMR but I also acknowledge a lot of people don't value it, I have come across people who value MMR like it's their Holy Grail while others think its broken and believe people show better performance/skill in their gameplay rather than being ignored for their skill based on a number.

Suppose prisoners were routinely tortured. This serves no rehabilitation or community protection function (let us suppose), we do it *only* to punish people who commit crimes and deter those who might be thinking about committing crime. We would probably argue that the government has a very strong duty to prevent future crime, and part of this prevention measure is to deter would be criminals by credibly threatening to punish those who break the law. The simplest way to be credible in your threats is to actually carry them out. So torturing prisoners is a good way to deter others from comitting crimes. But we would correctly identify this as a punishment which went far beyond anything a government should reasonably do to - for example - a petty thief (maybe there should be an exception for terrorists and paedophiles; I don't think there should be, but the argument is a lot stronger there so I understand if you disagree). Why do we make this judgement?

It is probably because we identify:

* The gains from torture are minimal over simply imprisoning people for life - anybody who doesn't find the idea of several years in prison deterring is unlikely to find the idea of several years of torture deterring (maybe they think they'll never be caught)

* Freedom from torture is an extremely fundamental right, which we should only take away if there really is no other way at all to protect the public from criminals.

So I agree with you that stripping prisoners of the vote is a punishment, but does it actually serve any purpose in deterring crime? I suspect (and this is just a guess) that it does not - perhaps the prisoners who are appealing are a special subgroup who might have been deterred, or perhaps they only realised how important it was after having it taken away. On the other side of the scale we have to ask, ""How fundamental is this right which we are taking away?"", and the answer is surely, ""Fairly fundamental, but not totally fundamental"" (which is to say, it isn't as important as being free from torture or to a fair trial, but is probably more important than the right not to be offended or the right to be spoken to politely by the prison guards).

So what I was trying to say was that it seems to be a reasonable position that stripping prisoners of rights for no purpose *other* than punishment seems like the sort of thing a civilised society ought not to do too often, and the importance of this maxim grows as the importance of the right you are talking about grows. I could be convinced either way by evidence, but on the basis of armchair philosophising I think I'm mostly indifferent to what the court decides but probably slightly prefer this outcome to the alternative - the deterrent effect of removing voting seems likely to be small to me, and punishing people for no reason doesn't seem ethical for the reasons I outline above. On the other hand, the harm of not being able to vote also seems small to me too, so if you could deter more than a handful of crimes by doing it then there might be a good argument for stripping prisoners of this right.",null,0,null,1423583611,null,0,false,0,coh3fb2,null,t3_2veh2l,null,t1_coh3fb2,null,t1_coh2rpc,null,null,null,null,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt; Throughout this dispute, your Union has confirmed time and again that we are not against drug &amp; alcohol testing but the breach of policies and procedures in this case cannot be left unchallenged. In this case, our member has a specific medical condition and the Union maintains that it was the failure to follow agreed procedures and to recognise that condition that has led to this unwarranted dismissal. The outdated and flawed drugs and alcohol policy should include provisions for secondary testing and have recognised equality protections. It has always been our position that there is simply not sufficient evidence to say that Alex was guilty or broke LUL’s policy.

Sounds like a legitimate reason as /u/brycey06 pointed out:

&gt; Management wanted to get rid of someone they don't like with a medical condition and used the (famously extremely strict, like way beyond other jobs, you don't need to be 'drunk' to fail it) alcohol rules to do it. No strikes happened when other people were booted for breaking the same rule, this was a targeted setup, not a random breath test.

&gt; And so do those doing tax avoidance. If they didn't it would be tax evasion.
 
No, that's not true at all.  There are plenty of tax loopholes that I could apply that I don't because they aren't aimed at me - I noted in my response above the way that you can apply expenses and second parties as employees or shareholders that are all within the letter of the law but clearly not within the spirit of it.

Paying a company based in another country a percentage of your sales so that you can use their brand name is a tax system set up so that companies can trade under the same brand name as foreign companies who don't want to have to set up the capital.  I'm quite happy to support these companies.  A subsidiary paying another subsidiary of the same company in a country with lower tax liabilities so that it can use a brand name is clearly not within the spirit of the law, even if it is within the letter of the law.  I'm not happy to support these companies.

Until we distinguish between the two, then we are forever going to be in these arguments about avoidance rather than evasion.  In my example, the former is not avoidance, the latter is.  Me claiming expenses to travel to a client who is not near my main office (and house) is not avoidance.  Claiming for heating in my house at the same time is.  Both within the letter of the law.",null,0,null,1423583819,null,0,false,0,coh3j8z,null,t3_2veggj,null,t1_coh3j8z,null,t1_coh2ex0,null,null,null,null,null,0,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,0,null

&gt; Throughout this dispute, your Union has confirmed time and again that we are not against drug &amp; alcohol testing but the breach of policies and procedures in this case cannot be left unchallenged. In this case, our member has a specific medical condition and the Union maintains that it was the failure to follow agreed procedures and to recognise that condition that has led to this unwarranted dismissal. The outdated and flawed drugs and alcohol policy should include provisions for secondary testing and have recognised equality protections. It has always been our position that there is simply not sufficient evidence to say that Alex was guilty or broke LUL’s policy.

Sounds like a legitimate reason as /u/brycey06 pointed out:

&gt; Management wanted to get rid of someone they don't like with a medical condition and used the (famously extremely strict, like way beyond other jobs, you don't need to be 'drunk' to fail it) alcohol rules to do it. No strikes happened when other people were booted for breaking the same rule, this was a targeted setup, not a random breath test.

And /u/ Muffinzz 

&gt; Hypoglycaemia (caused by diabetes or heavy exercise amongst others) can cause a false positive reading on a breath test. I found this out when testing breathalysers at my old job and I failed after running into work! IMO should've given the driver a blood test as there is reasonable doubt.

I let out a flat and the yield on it for the 2013-14 tax year is 2%. The vast majority of the costs, which lower my profit obviously and therefore the yield, come from the mortgage. After that my costs are maintenance, legal fees, insurance and tax in that order, which in total are less than 1/4 the mortgage. 

If I had an interest only mortgage instead of repayment (i.e. went full BTL scumbag mode) that would only lower my mortgage repayments by 1/5th~.

Every year that I've owned the property, the increase in its value has outstripped net income through rent. 1 year I only just covered costs due to shit tenants. The flat is in a massively overheated market area where rents are extortionate as well. 

Speaking to other landlords, the story is the same. Property represents a good return on investment in terms of yield, but the big pay off is in property price rises. I.e. you buy a property at a low ebb of the market, hold on to it for 10-15 years and then sell towards the top of the market.

Another point on democracy etc. that I forgot in my first post is that when dealing with these sorts of issues the Court will look at the wider community.

When the 2005 ruling was made this wasn't thought of as a big issue - most places let prisoners vote, the UK even let some prisoners (in very narrow circumstances) vote, and the ban was seen as a relic of a bygone age.

The efforts made to keep children in/pedos out would serve as a perfect way to prevent zombies coming in and they generally have huge playgrounds possible for the farming stuff and a kitchen with enough supplies to at least last me a month or two before having to go on supply runs and doesn't seem like too obvious of a choice for other survivors before me to muck it up. I imagine it wouldn't be too difficult.

Only if the outbreak happens to take place during school holidays though, I don't think my sanity could take wiping out a whole school of zombie children... Or that I even physically could

Failing that, a 2-3 story flat (the kind with giant sharp fences) would be a lovely place. Block the first set of stairs, put a ladder in that zombies can't climb and use the back gardens that they often have to grow the foods.",null,0,null,1423585026,null,0,1423585347,0,coh46ym,null,t3_2veq1p,null,t1_coh46ym,null,t1_coh1f6s,null,null,null,null,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

None apply. 

""Hun"" is used only to describe fans of Glasgow Rangers, the vast majority of which are Scottish. I've never heard it against English people but it is associated with pro-unionism. 

I have never once heard ""pommy"" said in Scotland. 

""Sassenach"" is the 17th century one I mentioned; it's not used outside of ironic comedy designed to make the speaker sound like a backwards hick from the past. 

""Sows"" never heard that in my life in any context, let alone up here. 

""Saeson"", maybe that's used in Gallic communities, that I cannot say. 

&gt; NO SCOTTISH PERSON IN THE WHOLE OF SCOTLAND HAS EVER BEEN RACIST TO THE ENGLISH is 

I said nothing remotely like that. At every step in this conversation people completely misconstrue what I'm saying then fly off the handle. 

Sure there are individual racists. There are people that hate people from the next town. But there is no common dislike or hatred for the English.

Other DW titles identify the publisher as ""DuBois-Media Holding Limited"" - but searching for that phrase results only in links to individual Google Play entries.

I found an old discussion on the Big Finish forums remarking on Kindle-format versions of some Short Trips collections, in which some users expressed skepticism regarding the legal status - but the thread only has a tiny amount of information, and no official statement from Big Finish.

Secondly as I already said this is not the ideal scenario but it is a scenario I can see the government accepting, if they for some reason chose to trial this with non violent black offenders it would still be a step in the right direction, that wouldn't happen of course because people would scream racism and whilst sexism would be claimed over this it would be a much easier storm for the government to weather.

        ""There can be no democratic choice against the 
         European treaties. One cannot exit the euro 
         without leaving the EU"".

So the question is whether Greece will have to leave the Euro despite Syriza saying they would like to remain.  The state of play remains that Greece still needs to receive bailout tranches and its condition for bailout was austerity and the IMF's Lagarde was already despondent in talks that austerity was too protracted.  If they can't restructure debt which would hit European Greek holders of debt and weaken its containment, then Greece will be in danger of defaulting and with the best will in the world that does mean dropping out of the Euro.

So if we take all the players at their word Greece has 18 days to restructure its debt or its going to miss its bailout and its debt will become even more expensive to service, at which point leaving the EU  becomes a very real possibility despite none of the players wanting it.

Greece is now asking for an extension to August.        
Germany so far isn't blinking.

Being left-wing I would prefer them to put taxes up to pay the deficit, but could accept cuts to public services while the economy was struggling. But not only have the cuts to services and welfare had a [much worse effect than I expected](http://blacktrianglecampaign.org/2014/10/21/uk-welfare-reform-deaths-updated-list-october-21st-2014/) (that's a list of people who have committed suicide or died for other reasons relating to having benefits cut), they've also cut tax for the richest (income tax, corporation tax (on large businesses only) and blocked an EU reform to stop excessive bankers' bonuses). 

Now, instead of giving money to the elderly who can't afford to heat their homes, they're giving money away to older people with enough spare to put into savings accounts, available up until just after the election. It kind of sums it up for me... oh don't get me started on the NHS paying private companies to do their work (my wife who works in the NHS but doesn't follow politics, just thinks it's weird that the hospital pays £40 per hour for non-NHS nurses, the only sense I can make is the number of [MPs connected with private health firms](http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/71-coalition-mps-who-voted-for-nhs-sell-off-linked-to-health-firms/)). Oops, I did get started.

If you try hard enough you can argue that black is the brightest colour, and that's what I feel they are doing when they justify cutting those taxes to people who they are constantly lobbied by, receiving donations from and often end up working with when they finish their political careers. 

Their argument is basically, we need big business or we'll lose jobs. I believe tackling those businesses will give more room for small businesses to develop and generate jobs. As it is, there's no way any British company playing by the rules can compete on price with companies who don't pay tax.

Edit: and despite all that and a **global economic recovery** they've still only reduced the deficit by a third. And that's why I don't believe the conservatives are as economically sensible as they and their friends in the media (obviously the papers, but also the [BBC](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2undvp/why_i_dont_trust_bbc_news_not_the_whole_bbc_just/)) like to make out.",null,0,null,1423586284,null,0,1423596324,0,coh4wz9,null,t3_2veogk,null,t1_coh4wz9,null,t1_coh3mxb,null,null,null,null,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

It boils down to whose responsibility it is. If the employee notified his boss, all is well and this is valid grounds for a strike.

No, I don't think that's true at all. The number of people needing childcare in any given year is a fraction of the workforce. I would be taking money off *everyone*, including those no kids and school-aged kids, to pay for more childcare subsidies.

Please note that I am not necessarily in favour of this idea! You just seemed to imply initially that it was impossible and, now, that it would be futile, and I don't think either of those things are close to being true.

(Just as a back-of-the-fag-packet calculation: there's something like 500,000 births a year, and an adult working population of about 35 million. Assuming kids need 3 years of childcare, you've got an age 1-4 population of ~1.5m. That means raising an extra £1 of tax on the workers gives you more than £20 per child you can pay out in subsidies. Feel free to correct my numbers, but even if I'm out by a factor of 5, my point still holds.)",null,0,null,1423587243,null,0,false,0,coh5h34,null,t3_2vaeg3,null,t1_coh5h34,null,t1_coh42lh,null,null,null,null,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Roger Hart spent a load of time with some kids in a small town in Vermont in the 70s, where he tracked where they were allowed to go and the secret places they would play. He then went back 30 years later and did the same with their children (75% of the original kids still live in the same town) and even though the crime rates have gone down, they parents are much stricter, with many of them giving their children a lot less freedom than they received from their own parents. 

The podcast was running with the theme that this is due to the fact that evolutionarily we are designed to always be alert due to fears and in our current lifestyles we don't have many threats so we inflate smaller fears to make them more significant and that's what is causing this behaviour.

plus rafa came in adn the squad was very much settled, they just lost a couple players in lavezzi and cavani, but their squad was young and pretty talented. BR, upon arriving, had a shit squad to deal with and was forced to play a 17 year old raheem for half the season, a 19 year old wisdom and 19 year old suso. i know br is all about giving youth a chance, but that was akin to becoming full first team regulars. that's unheard of in a top 4 league to have 3 teenagers starting regularly. 

at the end of the day, the record says it all, BR has a good points total, has rebuilt the squad, has improved (on rafa's foundation) how the academy interacts with the first team and i believe has created a completely different mentality in the club. it's top down and FSG have been brilliant and BR has been brilliant. he has had his ups and had his downs, but that's part of the problem with building a young squad from virtually nothing. you now look at all of the pieces and things are starting to come together very nicely. assuming we only really sell dead wood and replace that dead wood with some youngsters from academy and maybe 2-3 players in summer, our squad will be fully br's only geting better. i believe if you removed our 3 oldest players, we would have the youngest squad by a country mile in the prem...with those players we are top 3 behind maybe villa and southampton. but we're pretty freaking young, and the squad can put in a shift. i believe br is the man to take us forward, and he will win us silverware. the overarching fact is that when BR came in, we had just bottomed out and started getting back on our feet (thank you king kenny) from the HG debacle. the club and the squad were being completely rebuilt and I think now that the worst is certainly behind us, i don't see too many more growing pains.

&gt; Throughout this dispute, your Union has confirmed time and again that we are not against drug &amp; alcohol testing but the breach of policies and procedures in this case cannot be left unchallenged. In this case, our member has a specific medical condition and the Union maintains that it was the failure to follow agreed procedures and to recognise that condition that has led to this unwarranted dismissal. The outdated and flawed drugs and alcohol policy should include provisions for secondary testing and have recognised equality protections. It has always been our position that there is simply not sufficient evidence to say that Alex was guilty or broke LUL’s policy.

&gt; Sounds like a legitimate reason as /u/brycey06 pointed out:

&gt; Management wanted to get rid of someone they don't like with a medical condition and used the (famously extremely strict, like way beyond other jobs, you don't need to be 'drunk' to fail it) alcohol rules to do it. No strikes happened when other people were booted for breaking the same rule, this was a targeted setup, not a random breath test.

Anyhow, onto my opinions on the game. I'm expecting this game to be physical to say the least. On Sunday, West Brom scored from 2 corners and therefore Pulis has evidently put a tactic in for corners. I watched the game and saw a play sort of barging others out of the way so the 'best headers' so to speak, could challenge easier. I feel our team can cope with this physicality and I think with Ashley and Federico, who are quite tall and physical,  they will be able to cope with Berahino and most likely Brown in terms of aerially and most likely physically. Pace wise, I'm sure Ashley might cope, who is, for his size, extremely pacy, Fede, who is a fantastic defender, may lack the pace to cope with Ideye and Berahinho. I presume (hope) our RB and LB will bail us out if we get into any sticky situations with pace as Naughton and Taylor are both quick. In terms of our attackers I feel that if (when) Gomis has his shooting boots on and we play in the same way we did against West Brom we'll get a Certain draw and a hopeful win, however if we miss multiple chances I feel Oliviera might come on for either Shelvey, which I hope isn't the case, and/or comes on alongside Gomis, where I feel they may work together quite efficiently. Routledge is back, probably wont start but that's positive, I think Montero will start on the LW and Dyer on the right, but that's just guessing. 

All in all, it's a tough game against a 'Pulis' side, something that seems to be developing into a phrase these days, and therefore a win could be difficult. I'm going to go for a 1-1 draw, but would absolutely love a win!",null,0,null,1423588254,null,0,false,0,coh62ma,null,t3_2vfg06,null,t1_coh62ma,null,t3_2vfg06,null,null,null,null,null,5,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,5,null

The reason I point out the importance of this in continental competitions especially is that unlike most domestic leagues and cups the quality of the teams in those competitions tend to be very even. In Champions league you may eventually face teams that can just plain outclass you because of individual players, but before you get that far you will face teams that are your equal or very close personnel wise. 

As a result you have to perform at your best in everything you do to win, every little mistake can make the difference and in order to catch your opponent off guard speed is a factor as you wont face teams that can't organize a defense at this level, reversely if you can't quickly organize when defending and having lost possession teams at this level will hurt you. The execution of your attacks has to be clinical, quick, and if possible surprising. Luckily the Premier League prepares teams for opponents that press with intensity so our guys can handle having to make good decisions fast. 

I should also add that the first line of defense in a given situation might be a winger or even a striker, but usually it would be the central midfield, simply as thats where you'd find the most battles for possession, your central midfielder will tend to be able to find a pass quickly and be able to defend, some wingers can get away with doing attacking tasks only.

Putin holds a Q&amp;A session for several hours once a year. Members of the foreign press are invited (US, UK, German, EU etc.) and they are allowed to ask any question they like. These Q&amp;A sessions are broadcast live on Russian TV and on the internet. (None of the Western mainstream media ever shows it. Putin has been doing it for a few years now.) The senior BBC foreign affairs reporter (John somebody) asked a question in the last one a few months back, that he thought would trip Putin up - he was soon shot down in flames.

It is difficult to imagine Obama, Cheney, Cameron or Blair holding a 3 hour+ Q&amp;A session where members of the Russian, Chinese, Brazilian, Indian, Malaysian press etc. were free to ask any question they liked. The Western leaders would be shown to be the ignorant and foolish people that they actually are. (The US and UK televised ""debates"" are all stage managed events with stupid stage managed questions.

edit: as a for instance, doctors often refer people to the library to get books to help with things like depression in the form of Cognitive behavioral therapy.

Oganising special cases with a team of what would need to be in this case part time volunteers so that when the wife was with her family and husband we didnt hand her a book on divorce or self defence is a nightmare, we had a situation where one of our new staff almost handed her one of these books in front of her family because she had ordered in the book with the person the week before and she recognised her, the book reserved and had skimmed over the morning's delivery of books and spotted it. Obiviously her reservation and name known under was something completely different from what her family knew to protect her. Potentially Disasterous.

If you fancy digital comics (and I do, simply for storage reasons), then head over to [Comixology](https://www.comixology.com/), and click on the ""new to comixology"" link. Searching on the site will show you what they have so far (including the Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Doctor titles), of course.

When a team is put under pressure in this formation, the holding midfielders have to break up the play in front of the defence moreso than ever, because when wing-backs are chasing back, the outside CB's have to push wider which exposes the centre-back. The DM's role is basically to clear out anyone before they even reach the CB. That's something that Lucas does brilliantly because his tackling is fantastic (as is his professional fouling), and he's powerful enough to deal with physical threats. Allen certainly does not have that. He's smaller and weaker and he's more of a deep-lying playmaker style player. That works great for 4 at the back formations because the CB's need less protection, but it can be seriously exposed to 3 at the back, especially against a team like Spurs. Their movement in attack with Eriksen, Lamela and Kane could wreak havoc.

Unlike the Tories, who have pledged to achieve an absolute surplus by the end of the parliament, the party has promised only to eliminate the current deficit, while also leaving room to borrow for investment.    

&gt;by an additional 0.1 per cent in 2017, 0.1 per cent in 2018 and 0.2 per cent in 2019     

Not exactly going to help us grow out of the debt we have much faster. 


Borrowing for investment, what Labour does best and what they did last time. Not exactly a convincing plan     

**Taken from the IFS 2015 report**

&gt;In the years leading up to the financial crisis, the UK economy experienced fairly strong, and extremely stable, growth. But despite this, at the time of the March 2008 Budget, public sector net borrowing in 2007–08 was thought to have been **£36.4 billion** or **2.6% of national income**. One way of thinking about this is that – after more than a decade of strong growth – the deficit in the years prior to 2008 had been substantial and debt had grown as a proportion of national income in every year since it had dipped below 30% of national income in 2001–02. **To believe this was genuinely cautious fiscal management really would require you to believe that boom and bust had been abolished – as Gordon Brown claimed on a number of occasions that it had been.** 




The IFS state that 
&gt;a decade of current budget balance while maintaining investment spending would reduce it by 9ppts.    
 

**9ppts by 2030!!!**  


You feel safe now?  Economic downturns happen on average every 10 years, in 10 years time under a Labour government we would be hideously exposed to any such downturn.

You guys are helping so much right now.
I think that if I point out the service charge thing, my employer will say it goes topping up my wages already (""you're above minimum wage already, what did you expect? company car and cellphone?"").

Bad-PR stunt would help either, beside getting me arrested or punched in the face (while I do love this kind of things... haven't been in a gunshot since I was living in cambodia and guatemala.. LOL).
It woudn't help the other workers either.

The best thing I can do is :
- point out the service charge thing in the most quiet and polite way. 
- point out that I will be living in the streets by the end of feb if I have to leave 2wks deposit and try to find out what the law really says about it (so to have a piece of legal paper to back me up).
- make clear that I'm looking for a decent salary - if this job pays enough to survive, I will have to look for another job while working at this one.

I don't like to be fucked. I like to be open to people. Maybe making this things clear will get me fired on the spot, but I'm supposing I won't have to lose my first two weeks wage. I'm appealing on human kindness on this one.

Those yields are really, really low.  House prices are high, not because landlords think they can make a fortune in rent, but because they think the underlying asset will rise in value.  In London, I'd suggest that these yields are incredibly low, demonstrate that.

When you consider property is inherently illiquid, and subject to stamp duty.  It's obvious people aren't buying to make a fast buck.

So putting a 22% tax on the rent, what's going to happen, in a supply constrained market, where demand has show no sign of stopping.  In London I think it's obvious, rents will rise.  Probably not the whole 22%, but obviously it's going to drive the prices up a bit.  It's not as if Landlords have been struggling to find people to pay the last few rises.

There is no solution other than limiting demand, or increasing supply.  Their solution addresses neither, but extracts money from that system, monies which are paid by the consumer (renter).

Your opinion is factually wrong. The accident was your fault.

That said, the average person isnt a conman and many private settlements occur on a regular basis for this kind of accident. I did the exact same thing you did 2 months ago (my fault!) and paid off the owner of the car I hit to have it fixed privately

Its possible the driver you hit desires this approach as they have no valid insurance, or are using a private owner insurance policy for a works van - if this is the case it makes sense that they'd prefer a private settlement

In any case it is sensible to protect your insurance policy by avoidance of claims on the record. If he does try and screw you over later, simply tell your insurers that you agreed a private compensatory settlement in a verbal agreement.

Verbal contract is a legal contract for this type of transaction and the other party would be in suable breach...

i think it's on a sliding scale, to a point, and teams that finish higher make more. im guessing liverpool will be up there in terms of revenue and probably will bring in 125-150m per season. considering we did 90m lasta year, that's realistic in my mind. 

so for 2015-2016 lfc's current revenues are: 
50m/season for kit sponsor 
*looking for* 30m for a shirt sponsor on the kit
5m for main stand 
125-150m for tv rights

that's 235m right there.

It means that he's likely to stay through the summer, if not for much longer than that, and even if he has plans to departure eventually it's much more likely to be Barca than anything else since he's known to be a Barca fan and can also play really well in the midfield.

As a general soccer fan I think it's nice though. I mean, yes, I'd have prefered him at City, I'm a City fan after all and want for us to succeed as much as possible, but I also have a lot of sympathy for Dortmund. Even ignoring their current league position they've lost two of their other stars in the past two summer transfer windows, and to their main rival no less, so this brings a lot of relief to their fans. I mean, imagine if Yaya and Aguero decided to jump over to United, and suddenly Silva is also rumored to go, tough situation right there.

So while I'd have liked him here I'm not too torn about it. Dortmund is a very likable club after all with some of football's best fans, they deserve to keep him after everything they've gone, and are still going through. Of course there's the possibility that this is just to give more cash to the club, but reading the press release and everything I really don't get that vibe, he either stays at Dortmund or he's planning a future move to Barca.",null,0,null,1423591397,null,0,false,0,coh7zya,null,t3_2vflf7,null,t1_coh7zya,null,t3_2vflf7,null,null,null,null,null,9,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,9,null

We can agree on that. Did you see the Translink Director's quit his job to become a Preacher? Tells you everything you need to know about the intelligence levels at the height of that organisation.

The point remains (and we can go broader to include Twaddell if you want - it makes no difference to me) that pishing money on a cycle scheme when we're a country in dire financial straits isn't really investment worth talking about on any real scale. 

I've been to plenty of cities with bikes for hire. It's of some value for tourists and city-centre workers. Problem is, Belfast's so small this attempt just looks like a cynical ploy to emulate the big boys.

I provided data, showing that you often get as low as 2.5%.  Which the data shows.  I'm not saying London is everything, but it is most certainly the highest collection of high cost properties, which distorts national averages somewhat.

&gt; Also as property prices will over a long enough time period trend upwards at roughly the rate of inflation

I wish in London!  Go back, 5, 10, 15 years, in London, it's massively outstripped CPI/RPI.

I forget how much % of UK housing value is in London-ish area, but it's kind of huge.  Plus that was the only good place that has yield with a remotely respectable sample size.  If you have better data, I'm sure it would be welcomed.

In places far removed, where property competition is less, yields will probably be higher.  If anything, we need to do more to encourage landlords in that part, not tax them.  If there was more competition of Landlords (as there is in London) yields might well be lower.  However, we'd expect something thats less liquid to have a higher yield, I'm assuming that it's harder to find a tenant in a smaller place.  Most people I know who rent out in London never have to wait more than a week for a tenant.

The fact is, as the data shows, currently the market is quite competitive, not enough to cover interest (which was my point), that's before you get into furnishing, wear and tear, and even more importantly in London, ground rent and service charges.",null,0,null,1423591542,null,0,false,0,coh835y,null,t3_2vf5be,null,t1_coh835y,null,t1_coh7puz,null,null,null,null,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

**Glasgow** - beautiful gothic city, friendly people, great bars (but also drunks...), as an American you might be confused by the local accent

**Kingston** - leafy, suburban, safe, slightly boring but with decent connections into London

**Liverpool** - vibrant, fun, friendly, cheap, again the accent might be harder for you to understand

**London** - all of the above (except cheap), and a great life experience to study in the capital, also gives you the option to explore other parts of the UK/Europe from a central hub


All of your choices have airport connections to enable you to make visits home to the States, but London undoubtedly has the best connections.

I can't speak for the quality or lack thereof of the other institutions, but (for my sins) I went to London Met.  It's generally regarded as a shitty University with a handful of exceptional faculties (art being one of them).  It's a former polytechnic that recently got into a lot of trouble for supposedly taking in fee paying foreign students (thereby granting them entry visas) and then promptly doing fuck all to stop students from failing to attend (and instead disappearing to who knows where with their visas).  Cass is a great school and has highly regarded teaching.  If you want to experience life in an expensive but incredibly exciting city, that's a true melting pot of people and cultures, and also have the opportunity to explore further afield in Europe at the weekend with a low cost airline, London is a no-brainer.  

Second choice would the Glasgow, because it's pretty lovely.

Don't like big cities?  Go for Kingston.  

I don't have much experience of Liverpool, but I'm sure a Scouser will be on board soon to tell you more about it.

The BBC tries its damnedest to be seen as unbias, and yet the left argue it's right wing and vice versa.

I think that me and you broadly agree on what is 'right', and so I can understand your outrage.

That said, I don't think the government is evil, nor the people that work for it. I don't believe anyone working for ATOS, assessing the disabled, would go out of their way to cause suicide or heart attacks. You have clearly read up more on this than I have, but I felt the black triangle website was a little sensationalist and I think that only goes to discredit something that clearly is a problem. The first case I read was a man that 'took his own life because of the bedroom tax', whereas the article reads that he was unemployed, indebted to loan companies and spent all his money on his drinking problem. No doubt this is sad, and not helped by the bedroom tax, but hardly the cause. A lot of the deaths through illness are rather specious too.

I agree that money could be found through cutting spending elsewhere, but I also believe welfare is an area that needs looking at. Someone who has lived on benefits their entire life will find this difficult but we're only borrowing from the future and their generations sick/elderly, with our current rate of spending. 

Tax dodgers are very much a problem, one that needs to be addressed through global agreement, but i'm not sure I agree with your assessment of corporation tax. Our corporation tax is still higher than the european average, and in this globalized economy we have to be careful to not make our exporters noncompetitive. Same with the financial tax, sadly our economy is mainly banking, and so to make our banking sector noncompetitive would be suicide for our economy.

With the rise of China, Brazil, India, we are going to have a lot more competition from countries that pay less wages, don't run a welfare state nor give 4 weeks paternity leave (todays headline). 

We are going to struggle, more and more, and there's nothing we can do about it. I am on less than the average UK wage, and yet I am in the richest 5% globally... that cannot and will not continue. 

I often struggle to argue the case for contributing to our welfare system whilst leaving the rest of the world to rot. Will we accept such a drastic change in our living standards? It doesn't seem that we will have a choice

Thibaut Courtois (goalkeeper) - one of the best goalies in the world and only 22 years old.

Branislav Ivanovic (right full-back) - one of our two Serbian tanks, servant of the club since 2008 and one of the first names on the teamsheet. Loves to bomb forward from his right-back position to help out in attacking situations.

John Terry (centre-back) - one of the best centre-backs in the history of the Premier League since joining the club in 1998. Captain. Leader. Legend.

Gary Cahill (centre-back) - somewhat inconsistent, but has had a good couple of games recently and is starting to get back to form.

Cesar Azpilicueta a.k.a. Dave (left/right full-back) - one of the best one-on-one defenders in the Premier League, hardly ever makes an error in defence and a fan favourite (I think).

Nemanja Matic (centre defensive midfield) - the second of our two Serbian tanks. Shields our two centre-backs and expertly breaks up our opponents' counter-attacks and efficiently gets the ball from the defenders up to the attackers. One of the best in the world at his job.

Cesc Fabregas (centre midfield) - has the ability to play a killer pass and carve an opponent's defence into two. Dictates the tempo of our play with his assured passing, be it short or long.

Eden Hazard (left midfield/left wing) - one of the top 20 players in the world, arguably one of the top 10 on current form, at the age of just 24. Sublime on the ball, dribbles past defenders as if they don't exist; the ball is virtually glued to his feet. Also my favourite player.

Oscar (central attacking midfield) - one of the hardest-working players on our team. Despite the needs associated with the position he plays in, he contributes massively to the defensive area of the game and his slide tackles are, for the most part, beautifully executed.

Willian (right midfield/right wing) - the single hardest-working player on our team. He is a very accomplished dribbler and uses his fleet of foot and searing pace to beat defenders. His defensive work rate is arguably just as great as his attacking work rate and he regularly tries to recover possession if we've just lost it.

Diego Costa (striker/centre-forward) - loves to get in defenders' faces and will not back down from a physical battle. His feisty attitude can get him into a spot of trouble from time to time (he is currently serving a 3-match ban for violent conduct) but is an absolute machine in front of goal; he has scored 17 goals in 19 appearances in the Premier League this season.

And then there's Jose Mourinho, the manager. The man is a genius, end of.

It's great to have you aboard the Chelsea bus! Up the Blues and KTBFFH! (keep the blue flag flying high)

I vividly remember watching highlights of a Chelsea vs Liverpool match at Stamford Bridge on a tv while I was 11. 

 What really stuck with me was Drogba's goal. Seeing him chesting and swivelling to thump a shot into Reina's net really made me stop to watch replay after replay. It was insane.

I would dedicate my football education to watching compilation videos of Drogba shrugging off hapless defenders and scoring with right foot, left foot and head and then sliding to his knees in celebration. He has since always been my favourite player. 

It didn't take me long until I knew every player's name but I didn't get to see Mourinho in his winning days at Chelsea because he left pretty soon after I started following them. But I couldn't believe my luck when he returned.

I saved up money as a teen to buy Chelsea's 08/09 kit and watched in horror as we lost in that Moscow shoot out. 

I remember watching Torres slipping on the Chelsea shirt and watching Liverpool fans burn theirs. 

It's my dream to watch Chelsea play at home but as a student, I can't afford a ticket.

Part of the reason why tourism is still in its infancy here (apart from the obvious ones) are precisely to do with the lack of infrastructure. These bikes, while being partially sponsored, are down the list of priorities of infrastructure building here. 

Hell, look at the actual state of the tourists wandering around Belfast City Centre on any given day - they don't need bikes, they need signs and directions to the Titanic Quarter, they need train rides to the pretty beaches and full coastal bus services.

&gt;

&gt;The __high rising terminal__ (HRT), also known as __uptalk__, __upspeak__, __rising inflection__, or __high rising intonation__ (HRI), is a feature of some accents of [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) where [declarative sentences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_sentence) are uttered with rising [intonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intonation_(linguistics\)).

&gt;Empirically, one report proposes that HRT in [American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English) and [Australian English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_English) is marked by a high tone (high pitch or high [fundamental frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_frequency)) beginning on the final accented syllable near the end of the statement (the terminal), and continuing to increase in frequency (up to 40%) to the end of the intonational phrase.  New research suggests that the actual rise can occur one or more syllables after the last accented syllable of the phrase, and its range is much more variable than previously thought.

I believe the mallard was named 'Quacky Guacky' and was used in print and on the radio, where he sang a song about how the British Avocado was not only nutritious, but also improved your eyesight, hence improving your cricket skills.

Of course, nowadays people ascribe that quality to carrots, but we as a family remember because of Granddad. There was also a press campaign about not being 'out for a duck with British pluck' or something.

Grandfather died happy though, because a few years before he died they erected a small statue of him holding a British Avocado in Darlington. He felt his work had been finally recognised.

My dad / uncle actually went over to Steaua București to watch the game. Unfortnately I was 12 then so I couldn't go but I went to the home game at St Marys, it was nothing special.

Alcohol was really cheap since they didn't follow the official guides, apparently most of the Saints fans were herded into a pub which was charging almost UK prices. They found this small place and drank it dry, so they got the special local Romanian stuff from the back which was apparently very strong. 

Said it wasn't a nice place and that the stadium didn't even have toilets or any other facilities. Someone brought along sandwhiches and handed them out. Some fans managed to get in without a ticket because it was so dis-organised.

The fans were offered a police briefing when they bought a ticket and were told specific instructions about not carrying alot, too much money etc.

Apparently a Saints Fan got robbed, went to the police station to report the theft. The police there were basically expecting a massive bribe and said ""Are you accusing one of our countrymen of stealing?"" I think this included his passport which meant he had to go to the embassy and it was a massive mess.

This is because new situations arise which require regulation. Equally, old laws become defunct - but this isn't really a noticeable process, because the defunct laws aren't repealed. This is the process of an unwritten constitution and an evolving legal system. A lot more laws are paper exercises to clarify and round up existing laws. For example the Criminal Justice Act 1988 covers a lot of personal assault laws - but assaulting and harming another person *was* a crime before 1988.

What do you mean *recently* taken away? You couldn't graze your cattle on common parkland for an extremely long time. As in, enclosure was a political issue hundreds of years ago. All land is owned now, and if it's not owned by you, you can't use it for your hypothetical cattle. Or your real cattle, which you don't own.

Clichy has to fight, Milner has to fight and they have been our best players recently. Hart had to fight off Willy and he raised his game. 

Last year Negredo came in and fought off Dzeko - scored 26 goals in half a season, then he dropped and immediately Dzeko fought his way back and scored 9 in our last 10 games. Probably his best Spain a city shirt 

This, IMO is Our best 11 - Hart, Zaba, Kompany, Demi, Clichy, Yaya, Fernandinho, Silva, Nasri, Milner, Aguero. 

Only 2 have arrived after 2011. And Fernandinho has massively fallen off his fantastic performances last year. Do you think he's worried about Fernando? Do you think Zaba loses sleep over Sagna? Demichelis doesn't mind -he's getting ready to retire. Silva knows he's fine - and Pellegrini's rotation policy seems to keep Nasri and Navas happy as not-quite-starters.

The top-tier marking for bike locks in the UK is ""Sold Secure Gold"" - it relates to how well the lock resists attack with increasing severity of tools. Some locks also come with a theft guarantee, but that often relies on the thief leaving the busted lock behind to be able to claim.

Cheap locks can be snipped with small hand tools (small enough for Mister Thief to easily conceal in a backpack).

&gt; landlords can flip it, pretend to live in it and get away with not paying capital gains tax.

Landlords can't game the system by ""pretending"" to live in their houses. They need to actually live in one house, and HMRC are going to notice pretty quickly if they claim to be living in two places at once.

They might live with their spouse or relative, and lie about having their own place, of course.

b)Killed a million people over lies and misrepresenting the truth in Iraq and Afghanistan, if that doesn't get the left / liberals riled up for protest i don't know what will.

b(2.0), many of the police guidelines are heavy handed and over-reactionary when it comes to protests, I'm assuming that's to fill your criteria here.

c) Removed the right to trial by Jury, if the judge thinks ""they might rule the wrong way"" because of intimidation (sure),

null,false,EpicFishFingers,null,null,null,"The entire keyboard design does my head in. I've never seen the # displayed on any macbook keyboard, but I'll take your word for it that it is on yours.

@ is swapped with “. There isn't an indent on the caps lock key so it's easy to accidentally hit. The backspace and enter keys are undersized, as are the arrow keys, and as I don't have a macbook for experimenting, I don't know what alt + the other numbers do. Maybe you'll find some long-lost keys :p

It's a decent size for a 13"" laptop, apple haven't wasted space at the sides of the keyboard, but that and simply adding a £ key to the UK version doesn't make up for deliberately straying from the standard keyboard design to make it a pain in the arse whenever you have to use any other laptop and you forget where the keys are.

The standard defence I hear is that you get used to it, but I never hear any legitimate reasons for moving the keys around in the first place. For enough if you need to oust a line to make the small keyboard usable, but why hide the # key instead of, say, that button to the left of the 1 key? Or why make the capslock button so large and the enter and backspace so small?

Given apple's reputation I suppose I should just be glad they didn't go full hipster and use the Dvorak setup, but still, I believe their current keyboard is sub-par

I should add that while French accent letters are hard on windows keyboards, many programs exist that allow you to simply rebind your keys for such niche uses (we are still talking about UK keyboards, right?), and most of those programs inherently won't be for mac users.",null,0,null,1423596957,null,0,1423597147,0,cohb91h,null,t3_2v6h7g,null,t1_cohb91h,null,t1_cofgkch,null,null,null,null,null,1,false,BritishSuccess,t5_2vlyo,1,null

The real solution is better regulation. This has improved in recent years, with the introduction of various mandatory safety certificates, and escrow deposits. However, there is still a way to go on that front...

[He is a great motivator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ng9KUcUq14), always asks his players to give their best and pushes them to their best. Through that, he builds very strong emotional bonds through players. [Here is Ibrahimovic's view on Mourinho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZ8bOD5baM). He also is a very direct person (tells you how it is) and for that he gets in trouble for it. Whether or not it is deserved is your choice, but it happens. 

Ramires is a Brazilian center midfield. He is very hard working, runs fast, and is very aggressive (some say too aggressive). Injury/recent transfers has held him back from the starting lineup, but has been effective in recent games.

Filipe Luis is one of the world's best left backs's. He came to us from Atletcio Madrid with the sole purpose of being a backup LB. Very nice guy, and is a child at heart. 

Dider ""King Drogba"" Drogba is THE best striker Chelsea has had. Very psychical, great with his body, and has a knack for goals. He has tore up teams one by one since I can remember. Most notable Arsenal, which he scores on almost any time we play. He kills it in the FA Cup. Most importantly saved our ass in UEFA Champions League final (UCL) against Bayern Munich (in Munich btw) with a game tying header. Then finished them off with a PK to win the our first UCL trophy. My favorite Chelsea player of all time. He is here to mentor young players, and hopefully become a coach in the future.

Loic Remy, is a quick French striker. Works hard every time he comes in and makes amazing runs behind the defense. He is in great form as a backup, and will be needed in the future.


Petr Cech, is the best Chelsea goalkeeper ever (some older fans may argue Cudicini is though). He is one of the best in the world too. He is with us to teach Courtois some tricks, and be our back up. Very nice guy, funny on twitter, and great drummer.

John Obi Mikel, a center defensive midfield, is a veteran of our team. He has been here since the age of 18 (currently 27). **Rarely** scores, but when he does it's the best feeling. You may hear people chant ""SHOOT"" every time he touches the ball afterwards. 

Zouma is a young french center back. Very jolly guy. He works hard. Very fast and physical. Some argue he should start over Cahill.

Juan Cuadrado is a recent signing who will be thrown into the rotation. Don't know too much about him outside the fact that he works hard, plays defense well, and is fast. Oh and he likes to dance after goals.",null,0,null,1423597612,null,0,false,0,cohblrm,null,t3_2vfpbl,null,t1_cohblrm,null,t1_coh8jln,null,null,null,null,null,8,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,8,null

&gt; Chelsea have recalled Lewis Baker from his loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday, presumably a reaction to them dropping him this past Saturday.

null,false,Timothy_Claypole,null,null,null,"The OU *is* an actual university and an OU degree will open doors that degrees from quite a few other institutions would not, at least in the world of work.

The level 1 material, although part of your degree, is fairly low level and some people might look at this and say ""well I did that at A level"" and assume it is all like that. Not so. Level 2/3 courses, which would make up over half of your course are most certainly degree level and there are plenty of difficult courses to take.

I think a problem with a part time OU degree (you can study equivalent of full time too) is that with so long between doing starting and finishing you may not always retain every bit of knowledge in your head.

But why are OU degrees valued highly by a lot of employers? 

1. They are distance learning and you don't attend lectures. Your ability to understand the material is down to you sat at home reading and learning. No one teaches (although you are assigned a tutor who will help answer questions), you just learn. This is an incredibly important skill in any job. You have to really want to do the course to get through the difficult times.

2. A lot of people do OU degrees that fit around jobs or other things in their lives. This means time management is important. Finding 15 hours a week to study can be difficult. The other possibility is that you study for less and you are just clever so do not need that much time.

OU courses also have exams and most modules with exams take the lower grade of the exam and your coursework and that is your final grade. So if you get distinction over the course of a year you should be prepared to repeat that in an exam at the end.

Obviously degrees from Oxford or Cambridge are going to have more clout. They have more clout than degrees from a lot of places. But the OU has a reputation for quality distance learning.

And yes I am well aware of the opinion some have of the OU. Hell, I used to think the courses must be easy and the people doing them just a bit dim. But then I grew up. 

One final point: the ultimate test of a uni is how well it allows good students to really excel. A bright person studying at the OU will get through material quickly and they can fit more into their time. You can always take more courses in a year and there is nothing in the end stopping you from doing loads of modules, more than you need to get a degree.

that is incorrect according to[ this official premier league document.](http://m.premierleague.com/content/dam/premierleague/site-content/News/publications/handbooks/premier-league-handbook-2014-15.pdf) 

According to that document, which I quickly perused just now, these are the pitch sizes of every club in the EPL:

As you can clearly see, WHU has a bigger pitch than Everton (barely), QPR, Stoke and Tottenham. While it's an incremental difference, just thought I would straighten that out.

Yes, you can always find scary news stories if you look for them, but I think that there's a feeling of late that we really are on the precipice with regards to freedom of speech.  You could read Nick Cohen's articles, [e.g. this recent one](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/07/censorship-campus-no-way-fight-fanatics), or look at Spiked magazine, or choose virtually anyone who writes about free-speech topics and you'll see a similar concern.

OK - so having said that - was I right to get annoyed with your comments?  From my perspective, I think you were being pushy and sarcastic and writing from a position of point-scoring rather than out of a genuine desire to see sources.  It's fine to ask for sources, but you don't have to go about it in a finger pointing way.

I'm not above sarcasm myself as a look through my comments will show.
