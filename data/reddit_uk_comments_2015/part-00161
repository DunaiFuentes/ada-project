I've listened to it a few times and honestly, if I'm in the mood it can be funny, but you can't think too much about anything said. It's the kind of chat you will get after half a dozen pints down at your local - you know, where everyone isn't hammered to the point of slurring their words but incredibly loose-lipped about everything under the sun. 

I suspect it would offend many people here (hell, he offends many people in the states but of course they have set in stone freedom of speech laws).

What this whole saga has shown to me though is the different way we treat celebrities here. The hero worship still exists for sure but it's not nearly on the same level. And I have also lost some respect from RDJ - the way he handled it was more like the way a child would handle not getting what they want; he got too emotional, visibly upset actually.

I actually kind of figured that RDJ might have enjoyed talking about something important to his life, rather than the air-headed ad-nauseum he usually has to endure on these press junkets. He is forced to attend due to contractual obligations and it's not like he gets a portion of the movies earnings (Hollywood doesn't do that anymore, unlike in the Schwarzenegger days when everyone said he was the 'hardest working man in Hollywood'). So he has to sit for 5 hours talking about the same banal shite with journo after journo for nothing.

The UN can't dictate to countries like China or Israel because of the veto powers held by the members of the security council. The veto powers that the UNSC members have means that they and their allies can't be touched by UN resolutions, sanctions and other official declarations. It isn't the fault of the UN that it can't outright criticise certain nations like Israel because traditionally the US has always backed them with its veto powers.

I'm very amicable towards scrapping the veto powers the UNSC has, but keep in mind that the UN was designed to overcome the failures of its predecessor, the League of Nations, were its more powerful members like the USSR and Nazi Germany simply left the organisation when it no longer suited them. The purpose of the veto is simply to keep the major world powers inside the UN.

Necessity and proportionality are established principles in humanitarian law. Under IHL, a belligerent may apply only the amount and kind of force necessary to defeat the enemy. Further, attacks on military objects must not cause loss of civilian life considered excessive in relation to the direct military advantage anticipated.[44] Every feasible precaution must be taken by commanders to avoid civilian casualties.[45] The principle of proportionality has also been found by the ICRC to form part of customary international law in international and non-international armed conflicts.

You may have to wait a few hours or attend a local clinic but that often beats waiting for hours in A&amp;E or inappropriately using the 999 service.

Things are maybe improving and people are definitely making more use of 111 but there's still a huge number of people who either aren't aware of the service or don't believe it is suitable for their particular complaint.  There's also the issue that for many cases 111 simply pass on calls to 999 because they cannot afford to take any chances.  You see this frequently in chest infections, someone calls 111 and tells them they're having trouble breathing (as you'd expect) and the worst case scenario means they're obligated to pass the call to 999 when the reality is dispatching a doctor or nurse with the ability to prescribe antibiotics would be more efficient and better for the patient.

Only downside to that can be the price as mostly good players that age are rarely not wanted by many. I can only assume that this is an accident, rather than choice that all our latest younger player transfers have been in that U21 bracket. 

Half (transfers that are considered young players) is still much more than clubs in Liverpool's situation normally work with. Even if I look at the list of your examples it looks to me that quite a few of them are 'plug-hole' signings - Lambert, Toure, Sahin, Assaidi (he's a weird one, apparently the Transfer Committee bought him, seems like we got him because he was cheap and just because we could), Cissokho. Absolutely nothing wrong with signings like these, I'd welcome them, but not that much that they make up about 50% of our experienced players' transfers (which is already the other 50% of all transfers as younger players make up the other half).

Southampton for obvious reasons.

United because their fans don't bring up money, history, etc. Every time they lose like certain clubs. Then again maybe it would be different if they were no longer successful.

Respect Liverpool and Arsenal fans the least. Never used to be that bothered about Arsenal besides the obvious rivalry. Liverpool fans have been boring for ages now, next season has been their season for the past 25 years and then when they lose the just rabbit on about their history and winning trophies 30-40 years seems to be more relevant in the modern day than winning trophies in the present. Yes we get it, your club was really good 30+ years ago, we get it, that doesn't mean they aren't a pile of dog shit now.

anyways the 4-4-2 is an interesting formation as it essentially is playing with 3 full time defenders (2 cbs and gerrard as a regista) and the full backs were more wing backs than anything. we had numbers in the midfield and the attacking trident of sturridge suarez and sterling had too much pace, trickery and goals in their boots to be denied. having just suarez alone makes it hard enough to not lose, but having two lethal finishers (and healthy) in sturridge and suarez is near impossible to mark if you're a center half. oddly enough, i think the best formation to play against  the 4-4-2 we used last year was actually the 3-4-3. clogs up the middle of the field and closer to the goal, while also providing some potency on the wings. we didn't really crush teams by playing down the wings, the game plan was to play through the middle. 

for next season with the player we have, i would honestly love to see us move to a 4-1-3-2 (not a diamond). i think we need to make use of lucas/can/new signing possibly in the dm role, have 3 attack minded midfielders (imagine fielding sterling, ibe and coutinho in that formation) and then 2 strikers to interchange and move ahead of our mids (sturridge +origi/ings/other new signing). the depth works well in that formation because in the 3 attacking mids, we can interchange markovich, lallana, or new signings pretty easily. it also allows us to utilize lucas/can/rossiter or a new dm signing effectively and would allow moreno and flanno/new rb to run the wings more. those are my opinions, but everyone else here has been spot on.",null,0,null,1430329003,null,0,false,0,cqsup5h,null,t3_34afws,null,t1_cqsup5h,null,t3_34afws,null,null,null,1432675574,null,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9,null

As I mentioned, Claudio Ranieri's nick name in the EPL was ""The Tinker Man"" because he often used a different lineup and was kind of curt and low key with the press.  Mourinho was so outspoken, confident, borderline arrogant and had a core of players that were deemed ""Untouchable"" he's never really been much for squad rotation either.

For some reason, he made it OK to be incredibly optimistic, confident, and was very much in favor of people having very high expectations of him and his team.  Not only did he not seem to shy away from it, he thrives in it.  He doesn't react to pressure the same way most others do.

&gt;  we all in the EU made that mistake and suddenly we are seeing Russian expansionism again.

Are you referring to the time a bunch of far right ultra-nationalists in Western Ukraine deposed the democratically elected leader much to the annoyance of eastern Ukraine? The people of Crimea want to be part of Russia, they have always wanted to be part of Russia, they have historically been part of Russia. A part of Ukraine which has been historically part of Russia rejoining Russia is not Russian expansionism. Russian troops protecting ethnic Russians in the east of Ukraine who do not support the Ukrainian government is not Russian expansionism. The USA and UK holding military exercises in Ukraine is western expansionism. Britian should not be holding military exercises in a neutral country on Russia's border. Could you imagine the British governments reaction if Russia chose to hole military exercises in Ireland? 

&gt; and it makes me sad that a lot of the rhetoric behind independence, and now for scrapping trident, seemed to want to actually run Scotland down so much.

It makes me sad that so much of being British is based on imperialism. Why is being neutral a bad thing? What business does a tiny nation in the North Atlantic have in Ukraine?

&gt; Meaningless. It's like Crimea joining the ICC. These courts get very little done.

That arguably [isn't the case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_indicted_in_the_International_Criminal_Court). 
The ICC sets precedents, and serves as a reminder that justice will be sought at all levels.


&gt; When Hamas are breaking it themselves?

Hamas doesn't control the West Bank, which the Palestinian Authority do. They have no control over each other, they are in fact ideologically opposed to each other, and are in power struggles against each other. By the Palestinian Authority joining the ICC, Palestinians are also accountable for any crimes they commit. So even if Hamas was the PA, it would still be a positive move, as they are opening themselves to prosecutions.

&gt; It's fair to withhold taxes from land occupied by terrorists/separatists. Similar to Ukraine, they have stopped supporting parts of Donetsk and Lugansk.

The PA are not terrorists/separatists. They are the recognized representatives of the Palestinian people in the West Bank. The PA have not occupied anywhere. Israel is universally described as the occupier of these territories, hence, the Occupied Territories. The BBC for example refer to them that way, and officially, Israel acknowledges that it occupies these lands. It is not similar to Ukraine whatsoever. It is illegal to withhold the taxes from the government of the Palestinian people.

&gt; Again, this has little to no meaning.

I think you will find it does. Israel, and the pro-Israeli lobby in America has a huge amount of support. Israel and America being close allies, what Israel asks for, America often does. If one was to look at significant UN resolutions regarding Israel, it isn't uncommon to see crazy numbers such as 163 for the resolution, and two against, the US and Israel being the latter, with occasionally places like the Marshall Islands having a vote boosting their count. I can show you more evidence for this later if you want.
America is currently the only thing truly motivating Israel to commit to a peace process, and by giving aid to Palestine is increasing the chances of that happening.

&gt;Hamas doesn't control the West Bank, which the Palestinian Authority do. They have no control over each other, they are in fact ideologically opposed to each other, and are in power struggles against each other. By the Palestinian Authority joining the ICC, Palestinians are also accountable for any crimes they commit. So even if Hamas was the PA, it would still be a positive move, as they are opening themselves to prosecutions.

""palestine"" is occupied Israeli land. Hamas just providing the occupation army. 

&gt;The PA have not occupied anywhere. Israel is universally described as the occupier of these territories, hence, the Occupied Territories. The BBC for example refer to them that way, and officially, Israel acknowledges that it occupies these lands. It is not similar to Ukraine whatsoever. It is illegal to withhold the taxes from the government of the Palestinian people.

The ""palestinian"" land exists as Israeli land. I refuse to acknowledge or accept ""palestine"" as an individual entity, remove Hamas, give them semi autonomy, then sure it's fine. Withholding taxes is fine in my books, especially when concerning occupiers. 

&gt;You know absolutely fuck all about the topic. If you want any more information, feel free to ask.

Right..Because I don't think the ICC is credible for convicting 30/1000s of war criminals? Or is it because I do not accept ""palestine"" as an individual entity?

A huge number of people in France found those cartoons incredibly offensive.

It's not what offends me, I don't find it particularly offensive. I've even clearly stated several times that there is no way in which the attacks can be condoned.

You should. Those are people who feel alienated from French society and the choice to attack something sacred to them is only furthering social stratification.

In no way have I EVER insinuated that 'they had it coming'.

&gt;I do note that you are too cowardly to actually post that 'criticism' you think the magazine deserves, probably because you are a huge coward.

I have posted my criticism, maybe you'd have seen it if you read my points. From earlier:
&gt;Yes, it's satire, but if it's offensive to the people that it is ostensibly set up to defend, then it is simply unacceptable. If I wore blackface as a satire of racism, would that be okay, even if most black people found it offensive? Charlie Hebdo is effectively doing this.

&gt;And... the terrorist sympathizer just continues to lie about Charlie Hebdo, even after he has been refuted many times. Are you even embarrassed that you have to lie so hard, in order to defend terrorism?

Their offices awash with blood and your main moral concern is whether their cartoons offended people.

I'm sorry, but when their satire does nothing but harm to the ethnic minorities that it's ostensibly defending, then it is immoral. You keep using the straw man that my main concern is whether or not the cartoons are offensive. It is not. The attacks were terrible by all means, but there is no controversy there. It is not worth arguing about, because from my point of view there is no world in which the killing of innocents is *ever* excusable.

You can call me a terrorism apologist if you like. Perhaps I am, I do feel that we should try to understand what would make a person want to go off and join ISIS. I certainly don't think that they are without blame. However, you have to look at what about our society could twist somebody to do something like that, and social stratification is a major cause.

That's my point. I'm not trying to say Charlie Hebdo's writers shouldn't be able to draw those cartoons. By all means they should have that right. But to actually do that, they are contributing to the alienation of a significant portion of the French community. Those cartoons *were* racist.

So---- The Palestinians owned it for many centuries, the Israeli's owned it for no more than 80 years. If you want to make a claim by how long each side owned it, the Palestinians probably win.
3. Israel has enough space as it is. It is hardly like Jews are being turned away from Israel, they are in fact being continually invited in. Can Saudi Arabia claim parts of Jordan when it wants to? Countries don't work solely on religion. There, as you may have noticed, though judging by your previous posts probably not, is not one big country solely for Shia's, or for Wahhabists. Countries work on nationalities as well. There are people who have for many centuries, identified as Palestinians. Iranians and Palestinians, it should be said, are ethnically very different.

I have depression and anxiety with agoraphobia and I had a home visit from the mental health team a couple of times who basically told me to pull my socks up and put me on antidepressants. After becoming homeless I was put in to a hostel and the staff there organised meetings with a charity called The Richmond Fellowship who helped me with things like benefits and shopping. I am forever grateful to them, and also the council for getting me accomodation. When I felt ready I reached out again to the NHS mental health team who ended up sectioning me for two weeks. None of us in there got any therapy we just sat around and were spoken down to by rude staff. The experience confirmed to me that the NHS doesn't actually have a mental health service. They can call it what they like but they provide no real help. I think part of the problem is with psychiatry itself and cannot see it existing in the future.
The best thing I did was just forget about getting any help and read self help books. If someone told me to do that I would have told them to piss off but it has helped me. I recommend Dr Wayne Dyer ' Your erroneous zones' and even Paul McKenna 'Change your life in 7 days'. It's not been a cure but they made sense to me and helped me to like myself again.

The Prime Minister is, constitutionally, whomever the Queen appoints. It would be the job of the new MPs to establish who that should be. I imagine they'd elect somebody out of a list of candidates who put themselves forward until somebody gets the support of a majority of MPs. If nothing else, candidates would have to be appointed in turn until the first one can pass a Queen's speech.

If political deadlock happens because the MPs just can't put a majority behind anybody to form a government, then that's a standard hung parliament new election scenario, though as far as I know the Queen would have to decide that. The Fixed-Term Parliament Act does put a spanner in the works... but I can't imagine a scenario when it's become clear that no government can be formed but a majority of sitting MPs don't vote to have an election anyway.

Edit: The Government stays the Government until the Queen invites somebody to form a new one. Even if the sitting PM loses his or her seat, they would remain PM. Maybe not for long - but it would be up to the Commons to get rid of the sitting PM in that situation, and they likely wouldn't do that until a successor had been chosen.

* Not being successful, due to the security systems in place, overall political control being in Russia and generally the interlinked nature of the relevant military and security services at the time.

The result is that both wars and military build up are far harder to justify to electorates and have significantly less efficacy, meaning more disarmament, and when one side starts disarming, that incentivises others to significantly reduce how much they spend on arms.

Finally, nukes are cheaper than the alternative. To cause the same level of military strength and power through conventional means you need to spend magnitudes more and employ many times as many people, all of whom are taken out of the productive workforce.

null,false,wittyusernameplease,null,null,null,"Hey, you might want to move this/repost it in /r/6thForm. However, as I've seen it, I'll bite. I did AQA History at A-Level from 2012-2014, so I remember what absolute hell it was pretty well. 

Basically: History A-Level is the hardest thing I've ever done in my entire life. Probably not what you want to hear, but it's true. I'm sure you know well enough that it feels insurmountable. To this day, I'm not quite sure how I got through it, but here are a few of the things I tried that made me somehow feel better/things I know helped others around me:

* For dates, make flashcards for each 'category' of dates. Put the year (and day/month if it's really necessary) on one side, and write the event on the other. Group the flashcards into categories like ""religion"" ""politics"" ""foreign policy"" and such (depending on your particular module) and then you'll get a good idea of the timeline of how certain things progressed. It's so much better than trying to abstractly remember lots of dates that don't seem linked at all. Assuming you have the AQA textbook, use the timelines in the front of the book to help you start to make the flashcards. Practise both determining the event from the date, and the date from the event, until you can do them all without thinking too hard about it.

* Alternatively, you can make big timelines for your bedroom walls. I would do big ones for each of the kind of narrative arcs/topics you cover in your modules, or by chunks of time. 

* When making notes for revision, don't just make notes on individual things. A-Level History is all about links, connections and synoptic analysis. Find past paper questions, find some hypothetical ones from sources online, or write some of your own, and then write the notes you'd want in order to answer those particular questions. Do this until you've covered all the material. It really helps to start thinking in an ""exam-minded"" way from the very beginning, because you can know as many obscure facts/analyses/etc. as you want, but if none of them mentally connect to one another or connect to questions, you're screwed. 

* Try writing out the textbook. A lot of people find this doesn't work, but for me it was one of the only ways I could get some stuff to sink in. Get out a variety of coloured pens, and literally rewrite your textbook into note form. Do it by hand -- that's what you'll be doing in the exam, and if you have a visual or kinetic learning style the act of writing itself will really help you. 

* If you're more auditory, try recording yourself talking about questions or ideas or reading out parts of your textbook. Listen to your recordings on the bus, whilst cooking/eating, between classes, during frees, whatever. 

Basically, your life needs to become History if you want to crack it. There's no easy way to say it, and there's no way to sugarcoat it. It's hard. Like, really hard. But like every other student who has been stressed out/confused/ready to give it all up and emigrate to Mexico because of History, you'll get through it. If you want any more advice or a shoulder to cry on, feel free to message me. Good luck, stay strong, and be very proud of the fact that you've actually survived a whole year of it already.

11. other academy players will get cut 

should free up around 600-700k/week in wages 

in: 

1. milner - no brainer. british nt player, veteran, winner, played at a team that was always competing, and managed to not get benched on a star studded city squad. his absolute peak years may be behind him, but a very good option to have in the team for domestic competition (cups and prem). would come on a free transfer and probably take a pay cut to 90-100k, which i'd be fine with for someone of his experience. has work rate, technique and versatility to match up with our philosophy. 
2. janmaat - he is a premier league rb, national team player for netherlands and had a standout campaign for newcastle. for somewhere between 10-15m, id say a good deal if he helped add depth/quality to our rb position. i know flanno is coming back, but he is still young at 22. 
3. vietto/benteke - vastly different players, players that i think could VERY WELL with us. vietto, more of a suarez type, bulldogish, never stops moving, poacher, opportunist, south american. benteke, fast, powerful, strong, strong aerially (something we haven't had in a striker for a long time), very adept with his feet and could play a lone striker role with sturridge running off/around him. 
4. ings - another no brainer signing in the vein of milner. young, british talent who would cost less than 5m and is in contention for national team spot. 
5. nainggolan - destroyer, adds to our belgian contingent (would have migs and origi to help him settle) and has an extremely nasty edge to him that i love. good on the ball as well and work rate to match our team's philosphy.

Out of interest though since you have claimed expertise, could you explain what you think of the fact that we do not own the Trident D5 II missiles that form a rather key part of our deterrent. Given this results in a position where the US can pull the plug on our nukes yet we have no sway in the other direction, I'm interested in whether you think the leverage such a position gives the US over the UK is an acceptable trade off and whether this creates a threat of inverse nuclear blackmail to Britain with regards to the US having the ability to leverage its position by threatening to withdraw support for Trident.

As a note I'm aware there are counterbalances to US influence e.g Diego Garcia (although that arrangement is completely unjustifiable and the US has plenty of other bases around the world and would manage without it). The same goes for its bases on UK soil, although even if the US cut Trident loose it would still make sense for us to keep them and the US knows that we wouldn't be able to throw our toys out of the pram without potentially losing our seat on the P5. I don't think these act as enough of a counterbalance and I think the asymmetry of our relationship with the US is evidenced by the numerous fuck ups we've followed them into of the past decade or so.

There is also the question of whether the cuts to conventional forces at the expense of Trident do more harm in the long run as this inhibits our ability to respond to actual threats rather than the highly theoretical one of the nuclear first strike against the UK.

There are many players who simply haven't performed well enough or they were injured, I really can't stand anyone who singles out a player when the whole team is shit. 

Markovic, Lallana, Lovren, they all cost more than Mario and haven't really been performing (Lallana is a good player no doubt). 
Players should adapt, but if the system isn't helping the player and it fails over and over again, don't blame a single player because that is bullshit. 

We should either not play Balotelli as a lone striker, or accept that this will be a painful learning process. People say he doesn't run, but Borini runs like a mad man and he didn't change anything. 



Balotelli is not lazy because he closes down when we don't have the ball, the frustrating part is when we do have the ball and he's outside the box. That isn't laziness, it is a lack of understanding which takes time to develop, its is not a lack of effort that people keep bitching about.

null,false,TurbowolfLover,null,null,null,"Holy fuck I predicted your response perfectly. The second I typed it I thought ""This guy is going to be childish and throw out 'OMG YOU THINK GAYS ARE NAZI'S!! LOLLOLOL'"" Amazing. If you actually read what I am saying you would realise that not all people believe what you do. Shocking, I know. For a deeply religious person writing a pro-homosexual message would indeed be comparable for us to support neo-Nazis. Again, if you stepped outside your room and actually met real people, you might have known this. 

Mainstream Athiesm in the UK only really came with the cultural revolution and it is still not everybody's view. For you (I am assuming to be about 16) to come in and say ""WE SHOULDN'T PANDER TO THESE PEOPLE"" when there is a God fearing man owning a small business being forced by law to violate his core beliefs shows a complete lack of empathy and a ridiculous level of self entitlement.

Anyway, back to the point. 

Since when is denying custom a ""special right""? This is a two way street. Why should all the power be with the consumer? If I lived in your ideal world, I could go to a Muslim's shop and demand he supply me with bacon and alcohol. I could go to a Jewish baker and ask for that cake I described. I obviously wouldn't do this out of human decency but this is the point we're facing.

I appreciate you trying to be smart and using logical fallacies but you need to actually make sure they apply. You are saying everybody should serve everybody. I said what that would imply. The ""slippery slope""  doesn't matter when you are already at the bottom of the slope.  

On a side note: You talk as if this is a union of transnational bakers not selling bread to gays. They were turned away by one small business because the guy couldn't morally write the message they wanted on that cake.

They left for Bayern fucking Munich. One of the few clubs in the world that you definitely consider going to if they're interested in you. This happens all the time in Spain with Barca and Real, and nobody blames managers in La Liga if this happens to them. 

&gt;And like you say he's not really brought in many huge headline players after they got famous.

Thats because Dortmund simply can't afford them and it goes against their wage structure. QPR pays their players more than Dortmund pays theirs. And the biggest reason, because Klopp is so damn good at finding talent, as well as Dortmund kinda being like Southampton in developing talent, he really doesn't need to. How many players does Dortmund have now, or had previously under his tenure, that are relatively big names? Several. 

&gt;He's got some trophies, and experience in Europe, sure,

Kinda glossing over two Bundesliga titles, the DFB-Pokal (which there is a very real chance he's about to win again this season), two DFB-Supercups, and being CL runners up, on top of continually having decent showings in Europe, and having to compete with Bayern within Germany. 
&gt;but this idea people keep going on about that all the best players in the world are queueing up to work with him is based on no evidence whatsoever (and even if they did, do people really think he'd have more pull than Mourinho or Van Gaal if we're competing for signatures?).

[Zlatan would.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-AnrpD0X4) Klopp is a big name. Also, who knows how Klopp would fair if he, Mourinho, and Van Gaal all had equal budgets to play with. It would probably be much, much closer than you're making it sound.  
&gt;It feels like this subreddit has this ridiculous overestimation of Klopp's stature and history as a manager, and really I don't feel like a manager has been more overrated by fans and the media since AVB leaving Porto or Hodgson after his wonder season at Fulham.

It is actually baffling that you believe this. 
&gt;He's definitely got more pedigree than Rodgers, but that's hardly a huge achievement,

No shit. 

&gt;and overall if you actually look at what he's done, he's nowhere near as accomplished a manager as someone like Rafa.

Rafa isn't coming back, there is no way he would work with FSG or the transfer committee, and they know that, so let this go. The comparison should be between Klopp and the current manager, not Klopp and an old one.

If anything, we've over achieved given that literally half our goals dried up from last year.

If Sturridge is fit for the season, this season looks very different. We probably win at least one of the semi-finals, and what is still just a seven point gap from United goes away.

That's an interesting point. In the original *Dalek Invasion of Earth* TV story, they didn't recognize the Doctor - the Doctor claimed that the invasion was ""about a million years"" before the Daleks they encountered on Skaro, and since there was no indication that they had time travel then, they wouldn't have known about *The Daleks*.

I don't know if there were any similar lines in the film though.

&gt;I'm not quite sure what you mean by that part.  

I was just wondering what the reason that there are only two ""thought records"" or films or whatever would be in this case.

Perhaps the Doctor escapes before they can force any more from him. Or perhaps he doesn't...

In practice though in the small claims court you can only claim for loss and proving loss is hard... Yes, in effect this means spamming has no consequences, unless you get the right judge, or they sent you thousands of messages.

(an important point in the regulations is there is no legal basis for 'selling' consent - so if company A sells company B an 'opt in' list company B must still ask for explicit permission to send marketing messages).

If you do want to go through a court, don't pick and choose, name *both* companies and let judge decide where fault lies.  If you don't, they'll just blame each other (my intuition would be that the firm who sent it are mainly to blame but it's not worth losing on a technical point if they try to claim they were working under orders from Paddy Power to wriggle out of it).

When Klopp loses he will only talk with pure honesty. Klopp being such a character will not mend well with FSG and the transfer committee. BR is more of a 'Yes-Man' which is the reason why we got him as manager in the first place.

null,false,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"&gt; You've fallen into the trap of believing something a political party says (don't worry I do that too sometimes) - the SNP says that most NO voters did so because they were promised devo max, this is not true. Only 25% of NO voters actually favour devo max (according to a poll reported in the Times newspaper, can't find it online but will try and scan the page in and post it here).

What the SNP say or don't say about No voters is beside the point.

You can look at [polls from 2011/2012](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/15/scottish-independence-devo-max-referendum) or [February 2014](http://blog.whatscotlandthinks.org/2014/02/what-does-scotland-think-about-more-devolution/) and they show very similar results to post-referendum polling in [October 2014](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/the-powers-struggle-poll-reveals-support-for-devo-max.25509432).

Which is that about 1/3 of people want no more powers, 1/3 of people want devo-max, and 1/3 of people want independence. I think it's reasonable to assume that most people who'd vote for independence would also vote for devo-max (as they see it as a stepping stone to independence itself), giving you about 1/3 for the status quo and 2/3 for devo-max.

&gt; To your first point - that seems like conjecture to me. I can't see a way you can definitively prove that (or me disprove it). All I can say is I don't know if I will vote SNP or Labour, but if I do vote Labour it will be because I think a strong SNP showing will lead to another indyref in the next 10 years.

We're both speculating, of course, but I think the SNP are well aware of the dangers of pushing for another referendum too soon.

Look at their position they're currently in. Less than six months ago people quite clearly voted No - they're as conscious of that as anyone.

However, as a result, there were some very clear promises that Scotland would get ""more powers, guaranteed"". That has produced the Smith Commission, which may or may not be turned into legislation, and also produced Labour's idea of a ""constitutional convention"" and the Conservative ""English votes for English Laws"" plan.

The SNP's focus for the next parliament, which is 5 years under the new FTPA, is simply to keep devolution a live issue at Westminster.

What will the legislation that's meant to implement the Smith Commission look like? How will EVEL work in practice, given that the current proposal clearly disadvantages Scottish MPs by preventing them from voting on the UK budget until everyone else has already voted? Where did Cameron's ""Carlisle Principle"" spring from and will that be used to rewind devolution rather than progress it?

If look look at the interval between referendums in the past then it's been about 17 years - 2014, 1997, and 1979 (and the [Scottish Covenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Covenant) in the 1950s).

My prediction is that, unless the UK leaves the EU, they won't call another one until 2025-2030.

That gives a couple of parliaments to see exactly what powers are delivered (or not), gives them a chance to prove that they can in fact use those powers to do the things they claim, and makes any future step to independence all the smaller.",null,0,null,1430339803,null,0,false,0,cqt25z8,null,t3_349ce4,null,t1_cqt25z8,null,t1_cqt03sv,null,null,null,1432679163,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Question 3 doesn't require as much focus as the other questions as you just have to look for quotes and use them to create a summary. You certainly won't be exhausted at the very beginning of the exam, so my teacher encouraged us to use **3, 1, 2** as the order for our questions - the order goes from the easiest question to the most difficult.

Case in point: Ramires' goal happened only because Cesc cut back (what essentially was) a prayer, hoping either Matic or Ramires would answer it. And answer it, Ramires did. Even with the corner, Drogba was never the target, it was always aimed at someone behind him.

Am I going to have to spell it out?

Now, take a look at the third table 'share of total tax' and look at the top 5%. they pay 48.3% of all income tax, up from 44.8% in 2010. So hey, they pay more of the total income tax bill after the 50% rate was reduced! Who could've thought such a think would happen!

Now look at the first table, the top 5%, their relative income was 26.4% of all income in the country in 2010 and now it is 25.6%. Which means, relatively, they aren't making as much money compared to us as they used to in 2010!

I think in their minds it will be too large of a step back financially to sack Rodgers in the wake of all of the prospects we've brought in (look at Spurs).

While I'm pretty biased in the hopes of getting an available Jürgen Klopp, I don't think it's going to happen unless the lads stop playing for Brendan and we see a really legitimate loss of the dressing room and ambition. 

The club have lacked the balls to make cutting decisions to show ambition since they sacked Kenny in my opinion. Look across the way at United (albeit they're financially better off), they've gone after a respected name as a coach to help secure a few solid transfers and a measure approach at getting back in the saddle.

No-one is discussing this figure besides you, for the reasons people have repeatedly explained. That's not the metric at issue.

&gt;Who could've thought such a think would happen!

No-one is questioning it, it's logically possible. People are discussing that the top rate of tax could potentially higher. Reducing the tax rates is in no way shape or form 'squeezing' people. Reducing tax rates when peoples' incomes rise, is giving them a break, a tax break, if you will. 

&gt;Now look at the first table, the top 5%, their relative income was 26.4% of all income in the country in 2010 and now it is 25.6%. Which means, relatively, they aren't making as much money compared to us as they used to in 2010!

We don't have the data to support that conclusion. If could be that the lower or middle classes rebounded after having been hit hard by the downturn (more likely, but again, I don't have the data to prove it).

No, we didn't use the funds from Suarez's departure as well as we'd all would have hoped but we have an abundance of squad depth without which we would have been fucked this season. Lovren is shaping up (finally), Can (while not the best at any respective position he's played) has been indispensable in his versatility, Lallana has for the most part looked consistently dangerous, creative and hungry. There's Ibe who I really don't need to address given his hype train, there's Markovic who in my mind is still a coin toss. The only two real flops judging by where we are now would be Balotelli and Lambert.

We have a huge conundrum currently among the fan base because we have just as much of a coin toss with the managerial situation. Do we maintain faith in Rodgers, has he earned that? I think so. Do we give Klopp a chance, another hard restart? I think he's earned his credibility but it's a double edged sword. 

All that being said, bringing Klopp in and a big surge in the transfer market could be exactly what the club needs, but it could also be the beginning of the same path we've just been down.

Yes, he is third string. Yes, he is old. No, ALL our other options are not injured. Yes, Izzy and Solanke are options, whether you like/agree or not. And. to counter your own point, Drogba didn't do all that well against the physicality of Leicester either. He might have been 'playing out of necessity but he didn't give defenders much to think about other than the goal he scored.

I may not have a great understanding of the game but I have watched Izzy and Solanke play and I can honestly say they would have put in a a good shift tonight - probably a lot better than what Drogba did, anyway. What they lack in experience, they would have made up in energy and enthusiasm. Not to mention, it would have earned them some precious minutes of first-team football. The one thing they didn't have going for them is that they had played a full 90 recently.

I am, in no way, denying that Drogba is a legend. At no point did I show him any disrespect.

Only what Pearce spilled - some Rodgers' signings were voted against by the TC. One of them was Vorm, I think. 

But I meant in larger scale too. The FSG transfer policy required us to buy more younger players than usual and it can sacrifice our readiness to compete for a moment or two if we got any of our more experienced player transfers wrong. Lovren, Lallana, Lambert didn't work out so well and we suffered. I'm reluctant to believe that Lovren was our first choice but I wouldn't have argued against the other two. *AT THE TIME* they seemed decent acquisitions.

&gt; You can't blame the transfer committee for all of the mistakes Rodgers has made this season

I won't. He got the start of the season wrong, tactics were off and he didn't find the right balance in the squad. It was hard, though, as we had many injuries and many new players. He got Gerrard situation completely wrong - to be honest, his fall was pretty rapid, but still expected. Their relationship could've also got into way, he's a BIG influence in dressing room, no doubt. I could say that he got CL wrong but it could've so easily been different. Remember, that Sterling wasted his 3 sitters against Basel away? More experience, composure, quality in the final third was needed, we've lacked that the whole season.

But I'm sure you agree that the work done in the summer gives us the tools to build on during the season. We're currently not prioritizing talent that's ready to perform from the off and not so rarely we get something really wrong in transfer windows. This time we got strikers wrong. The fact that we haven't targeted more experienced players last 3 years has accumulated into the situation we have now - barely any players are near their primer or are nearing it. 

However, I believe that we have decent foundation set for the future.

Tony Blair massively reformed the Lords by removing the vast majority of Hereditary peers in 1999. Whilst there is probably a consensus that inherited positions of power isn't suitable for a democracy or meritocracy, the reform was pushed through with the argument that ""anything is better than this"" and there was little preparation for what would replace the hereditary peers. If I recall correctly, it just resulted with Tony Blair replacing them the majority of them with Labour peers.

Additionally, the House of Lords Act 1999 was supposed to be the first stage in a long process of reforming the second chamber and the Liberal Democrats tried to pursue further reform under the Coalition government.

If you're happy to take that risk then by all means go for it, if you're not then don't. You will be better off money wise doing it all yourself rather than paying a letting agent probably all your profit to do the work for you.

Selling and moving is the safe option. Letting is a risk. My tenant has probably knocked 10-15% off the value of my house I let out with the way that they've treated it and before I sell it I'm going to have at least £10k, which is 4 years profit, to put into it on a house currently worth £110k to bring it back up to a point where it'll sell. The only upside is they pay on time every month and want to be there long term. 

Its a case of getting a sheet of paper and making a long list of cons and deciding whether that list makes any future profit from property price rises worth it.

I would still stick with interest only mortgages though, partly because it gives you that extra buffer between income and expenses and partly because in your case the more capital you pay off the more the more the taxman gets from you at a rate of 40% so year on year the amount that goes in your pocket and therefore the buffer you have gets less and less.

Lovren was pretty terrible at the beginning of the season that can't be avoided, but i feel like this was mainly due to the system BR was trying to play, we didn't have a player sitting in front of the defence when playing 4 at the back, and lovren needs that cover he's very much a front foot defender, thats why you're seeing improvements when playing in the 3 at the back system, he has other people covering for him, and when Lucas or joe allen are sitting in-front of a back 4 he looks good, recently he's been one of our best players (besides the 40 yard effort in the semi), if he carries on improving i think he'll more than prove his worth.

Lambert wasn't brought in to be the teams superstar, he was brought in to be a backup, he knew that, and i'm guessing he's a good player to have around the team, especially for younger players.

My main point is that players don't always come into a new team and blow everyone away, granted some do, Costa and Fabregas at chelsea for example, but there are many examples of players who come in to teams and don't have the desired impact straight away, look at Di Maria at United for Madrid last year he was probably their second best player, for united he hasn't been that great, but that doesn't mean that Di Maria is suddenly a terrible player. Another example is modric at madrid, had a pretty bad first season, since then has been probably the best center mid in the world.

Its not delusion so much as reality. You would be deluded to think we were going to get anywhere close to last seasons results without suarez. I predicted 5th place prior to the signings we made, and after the signings we made...well it was pretty much sealed. ESPECIALLY when Balo signed. did not see that one coming. 

We failed in achieving top 4, but our current place is predictable given our current squad. The squad is young, and has had to learn to play without the crutch of suarez. Our manager is also very young and has a large gap to fill. Basically, Suarez leaving fucked us up. We started at square 1 again. 

Now you're gonna call me extremely deluded, because actually I think a 5th place finish is a bit surprising given that Sturridge was out and Lucas was injured for so long. The injuries we've had this season have really hurt us, but we still managed 5th. I think thats pretty decent. If you're expecting more or calling that ""deluded"" then you need to take a look at our roster and then look over at the roster of the current top 4. huge difference in the depth, talent, and most importantly experience.

Does this really exist or ever existed? I think people are pissed of because of the rent situation and the changing markets no longer provide decent income to unskilled workers and they are blaming it on foreigners. 

I'm not in the UK, I live in Turkey and we recently accepted 2 million Syrian refugees and there is huge hate towards them.  The complaints are pretty much the same you people express here on reddit: Rents go up, low skill jobs harder to attain, low skill jobs pay less, beggars, stress on the national healthcare and education system,  they don't respect the glorious Turkish culture, they don't speak Turkish, many of them are the kind of muslims that most Turks hate.


However, I don't see the same hate towards other immigrants, there are millions other immigrants too - many naturalised.  I suspect that hating on Syrians is highly racially motivated.

Are you sure that UKIP is not just a club for hating on special kind of foreigners and blaming all the problems on them? Because the term you used, the ""unlimited immigration"" is really a fantasy, I know many people in Turkey, skilled white collar workers, who dream to move to UK but even getting a tourist visa is pain in the ass.

That said, I guess my main problem with Brendan in terms of statements and such is he has a serious tendency to take credit when things are working (e.g. we can challenge for the title, like above) and when it's not it's seemingly not his fault and due to things outside his control.  

BR in Jan: 

""This season was always going to be difficult.  With so many changes and everything that's happened, we weren't going to challenge for the league this year. That's reality.  This season has been about getting into the top four, minimising the impact of so many new signings, giving them the time to develop, and then targeting the cup competitions.""

Now that we've failed at top 4, it's changed again to:  

""We weren’t expected to get into the top four...We sit in fifth place, having reached two cup semi-finals, which is probably on par with where we are at.""

Which is it?  We're challenging for the title?  It it about getting into the top 4?  Or are we just aiming for 'par'?  The story keeps changing and I don't like that.  Just be honest and say it's not gone according to plan or how we wanted, quit pretending like the expectations were never what they were.

Now he's already proclaimed a title challenge next year and marquee signings.  If he is manager next season and neither of these things happen, then surely he's got to anticipate and deservedly so getting a bit of stick about them?

Two countries joined the EU a little while ago, Romania and Bulgaria, the combined populations of both countries is about 28 million.  Certain media claimed that 26 million people would flood the shores of the UK, that their bags were packed, that they were loaded onto buses ready to invade.

3 months after they'd joined the EU you could count the number of Romanian and Bulgarian invaders on both hands.

So how is it any difference to this notion that Rodgers can't keep players like Suarez when Barca come calling?

&gt; Zlatan would.

You really think if he was our manager and we went in for Zlatan, he'd come? And you really think that is a legitimate ""please sign me Jurgen"" rather than some joking in front of the cameras (by a player known for his showmanship). And do you think Zlatan would still show the same sort of eagerness to transfer to Dortmund now that they're not Champions League runners-up, as they were at the time of that video (especially given how hit and miss PSG were in Europe)? Pretty sure even if there's a hint of fire amongst the smoke in that video, it's because of Dortmund's status as a club at the time, and not because of Klopp as an individual. 

&gt; Kinda glossing over two Bundesliga titles, the DFB-Pokal (which there is a very real chance he's about to win again this season), two DFB-Supercups, and being CL runners up, on top of continually having decent showings in Europe, and having to compete with Bayern within Germany. 

I don't think I'm glossing over anything. I'm fully aware of what he's won. But AVB won shit at Porto and has yet to repeat that success elsewhere. 

And Dortmund have been worryingly mediocre this season if he's apparently such a fantastic manager. Do you not feel it's at least possible that his success was down to some alignment of the stars and the fact that he chanced into a couple of good signings all working together at the same time (while other teams at the top of the league stuttered), in the same way that arguably we managed to have last season? What if just he had a season where he got a few more signings that went the way of Coutinho and Sturridge rather than Aspas and Borini, and just rode those coat-tails for a bit?

Personally I don't see Dortmund's 2011-12 season being all that strikingly different to ours last season, with the exception that we needed Chelsea, Man City *and* Man Utd to all have slightly dodgy seasons. Take out two of those teams at random to leave us with just one and there's a pretty good chance we win the league last season. Dortmund's star burned brighter and slightly longer than ours did, but still doesn't mean that it wasn't still potentially just a fortunate combination of factors. 

The way I see it, there are some seriously fine margins in football. Gerrard doesn't slip, we get a draw or nick a win against Chelsea, and suddenly Rodgers potentially has a league title under his belt and maybe we're not calling for him to be replaced even with a shit season we've had now. When you get managers like Mourinho, Van Gaal, even Rafa - managers who have won trophies at different clubs, with different squads, multiple times. Managers who have repeated success. Then you're dealing with known pedigree - you're dealing with managers who have come the right side of those fine margins time and time again. 

Klopp I just don't see as anything like that sure-fire a bet. He had years of mediocrity with Mainz, getting them promoted then relegated again. He had a few average seasons at Dortmund before having three undeniably awesome ones, but now they're miles off the pace again. For me that just doesn't sit at all with him obviously being the answer and it being a no-brainer to tear up our current status quo and hire him.

If he's so great a manger, if he's so good at spotting and bringing in great talent, why haven't Dortmund built on the success they had two or three years ago and remained competitive? Why do they have 39 points from 30 games in the Bundesliga where, OK, they're not anywhere near as rich as Bayern, but Dortmund are still the 2nd richest club by a healthy margin with 25% more revenue than Shalke 06 as the 3rd richest, and more than double anyone after that. Compared to Liverpool's supposedly abysmal 58 from 34? Where we're the 5th richest and there's a much smaller gap to the clubs behind. There are 12 English clubs who have revenues above that of Hamburg, who are Germany's 4th richest. 

If Dortmund were still doing well, even if they were miles behind Bayern but still 2nd or 3rd, I'd be happy for Klopp to replace Rodgers. But they're not - they're having an even worse season than we are, and that's what's flagging alarm bells for me. Because I don't want to gamble switching manager and the whole transition and re-investment that comes with that on the basis of one glittering squad and a couple of years that Klopp had with it, because in my opinion there's no guarantee that Klopp can repeat that any more than there's a guarantee Brendan can repeat the kind of scintillating football we saw last season.

null,false,AnalAttackProbe,null,null,null,"&gt;I personally believe Allardyce is attempting to answer critics in his lack of support for younger players

Too little too late on that front. When you have the injury issues we've had this season after being deemed ""safe"" by Christmas, there is no excuse for not including a youth player in the XI until late April. With our injuries it was pretty clear we didn't have a ton to realistically play for, so why not give Lee, Chambers, Burke and Oxford a few shots at Premier-level play? Would we really have been any worse off resting guys like Reid and Collins every once in a while to give young guys a shot? Honestly, it probably would have been better for our chances of staying healthy.

Allardyce can't just say ""well I played the youths"" when he summarily ignored them for 3 years and 9 months only to toss one out with 4 matches left in his 4th year at the helm. It doesn't work that way.

&gt;Personally I'm a strong believer in the youth side of football

http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/23/tottenham-mauricio-pochettino-europa-league

It is generally considered that Europa hinders your league ambitions. Playing a game on Thursday evening in Eastern Europe, either flying back through the night (landing late Thurs/early Fri morning), or flying back the next morning (Friday) and potentially playing a league game on Saturday at 12.45 (if INCREDIBLY unlucky - not even sure if possible tbh) or 15.00.  It does not give enough time for training and match preparation in between. 

I agree we should be able to play 2 games a week, but most top clubs that hit Europa league (when they aim for CL) do struggle with it and I don't think it is that hard to see why.

Working with a manager you hold in high regard is something I'm sure players see as a big thing, but I'm sceptical how much sway that holds when trying to convince big players to gamble the peak years of their career on faith in a manager getting shit together in a couple of years rather than moving to bigger clubs who can compete for trophies right now.

One season in  fifth is not a crisis. Two seasons is. A season below 10th is. 

I will say the lack of silverware is also frustrating, and our inability to perform when we really need to needs to improve. I don't think sacking Rodgers is the best option for that, yet.

null,false,Silent_Ranger,null,null,null,"Yeah but you could also make the Joe Flacco analogy. He was a guy that wasn't a superstar but performs well when it matters and won a superbowl. Rodgers has proven that when he has talent on the roster he knows what to do with it. Liverpool would not have performed any better under Klopp than they did with Rodgers considering the talent in the squad. Also there is no guarantee that Klopp will actually recruit world-class talent if he did sign with Liverpool (although on paper he's in better position to do so than Rodgers). My biggest fear is that sacking Rodgers will burn that bridge and in 5 years when this team is at it's peak Klopp might not be around anymore (Guardiola only lasted 4 years at Barcelona, heck Rafa was only here for 6). I saw in Rodgers a person who already has his dream job, maybe he's not good enough (we don't know that for certain yet) but if he is up for the task I imagine that he would stay for decades like SAF or Wenger and really establish Liverpool as a long-standing dynasty. Some people are concerned that if Rodgers doesn't work out then next summer Klopp won't be available. Similarly I am concerned that 5, 10 years from now Rodgers could potentially have established himself as a top 5 manger in the world by putting Liverpool back on top, but if we let him go now for Klopp we'll reap a short term benefit that might end when Klopp inevitably leaves (whereas Rodgers gives off the vibe of a man who might never leave).",null,0,null,1430355711,null,0,false,0,cqtbyj2,null,t3_34afu4,null,t1_cqtbyj2,null,t1_cqsy3zf,null,null,null,1432683860,null,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null

null,false,MrFuckingRandom,null,null,null,"Yeah, that's the 3G or 4G. Most pitches you'll play on will be the '3G' as the 4G tends to be professional grade and very expensive. I've trained on these pitches for 9 years now at professional and semi-professional level, and you don't want to wear trainers on them, you'll slip and slide and it just feels odd. 

What you need is a pair of football boots, moulded studs, preferably adidas (f50 or adizero style) or nike tiempos. The reason is that (a) when it comes to traction, the small round or triangular studs offer better grip with the rubber pellets, and (b) most centres don't allow blades because they cut the carpet underneath the rubber.

Very few pitches use the other 'atroturf'. The other stuff is what they use for hockey pitches and its effectively sandpaper. Its a carpet covered in sand. It's horrible. Honestly, I've found boots to also be better for traction on those pitches, but equally, less comfortable because the surface is hard. I'd strongly advise not playing on those pitches.

If you're looking for a cheap pair of boots, Sports Direct often have the bottom 3 tiers of most boots (the £40, the £70 and the £100 versions) so you'll most likely find a pair there.

As for Dortmund, yes, they've had an awful season in the league, but overall they could wind up with 2 trophies even in a shit year for them.  Another major difference for me is Dortmund, as poor as results have been, never really looked like complete crap in terms of performances, which were generally good.  Us, on the other hand, have looked like a less organized version of my over 40 Sunday League team more than once this season.

null,false,givecake,null,null,null,"&gt; Your proposition does not help Christians, or those of any religion, in churches that affirm equality for LGBT people. They don't want civil partnerships.

This is not a bad point. But are you implying that all of Christianity should change to accommodate LGBT? That seems pretty unreasonable. Remember we're just talking about changing law here, which should be disconnected from religion.

&gt; I've never heard of a B&amp;B that refused divorcees or a wedding cake shop that asked for your marriage history, which leads me to the conclusion that some of the animus is not about high religious ideals but plain old intolerance.

I mostly agree on this. If religious folk want to protest on these grounds, they had better revisit all of the other things which run contrary to their beliefs, especially when many are far higher on the list. Bible says we should love even our enemies, so I don't see any reason to treat people badly because of LGBT persuasions. 

But needing to necessarily accept that LGBT is a good and natural thing? There are plenty of ways this can make it's way into public sphere. The theory of evolution has set a negative precedence for this to come. While much of the theory of evolution is true, tried and tested, huge parts are not, and yet these parts are taken as true too. All that needs to happen is for learning institutions to accept into their curricula that certain biological changes, like increase in male/female hormones can change the way our bodies look, and then paint in some very loose inferences about how homosexuality is therefore normal and natural, and it is being basically forced onto a new generation. I'd argue the media is likely more influential in this regard, and is already doing this, but it's not really the same thing. People wouldn't accept it if the bible was accepted as true because of, say, geographical and archaeological findings which support a certain percentage of the OT's accounts. They'd feel religion is being forced on the youth. And I'd agree. Granted, this type of thing hasn't happened yet, so I'm not overly worried, but it seems like a logical next step towards the current trend of increasing political correctness.

&gt; Just as the ending of miscegenation laws exposed underlying racism. That's one rule of marriage traditional Christians have now abandoned.

My point isn't one that points to religious tradition, but just the dictionary definition being linked to the religious rite. That's why people get upset right, they feel people are trying to change their religion. This doesn't appear to be true, on the outset, but it's one of those plays which could subtly change things for Christians. 

&gt; I took you to be saying that equal marriage proponents were creating a controversy where there didn't need to be one. I think that's to perhaps misunderstand the range of voices involved in the debate. The people who are most passionate about it are people of faith and their passion springs from the same place that yours does. 

Hm... I haven't got this impression at any point. Perhaps you're right. Do you have any articles that represent the voice of these religious folk? 

&gt; I know we'll probably not agree on this subject but I appreciate your taking up the opportunity to exchange views.

We've already agreed on certain points, and I find it valuable to discuss and sift ideas. Thanks for taking a reasonable approach!",null,0,null,1430357499,null,0,false,0,cqtd0hp,null,t3_341pwi,null,t1_cqtd0hp,null,t1_cqsp252,null,null,null,1432684357,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,nimbleal,null,null,null,"Thank you for the sensible reply. I’m here hoping for reasoned debate. Incidentally, I won’t be voting for UKIP and I’m pro-immigration, but that’s not really relevant. I feel the need to stick up for Farage because he seems to have real convictions (sadly lacking in the Lib/Lab/Con establishment) and it appears he has a democratic right to be taken seriously, given the support that his party has. 

&gt; His inability to discuss anything other than immigration and the EU at debates suggests…

I would suggest that he wants to focus on these issues not because they’re the ones “he knows he has support on”, but because they are the issues that really matter to him and his party. An exit from the EU is his party’s founding and most central policy. You’ll notice that he talks quite a lot about the deficit, foreign aid and HS2 too, so he is willing to discuss some other things.  

&gt; A journalist pushing a politician isn’t ‘aggressive, nasty-soundbite-hunting journalism and establishment spin’, it’s good journalism.

I would agree, and add that I think that there are many good journalists at work in the UK. But there are also journalists that go in with an agenda: to trick a soundbite out of someone and then report the soundbite they wanted out of context, accompanied by sensationalist headline. I dislike that kind of journalism intensely, whoever it is targeting. 

&gt; …Race Relations Acts, he could clarify he only supports removing nationality from the list of protected characteristics, and only in the workplace. 

He said that he’d get rid of “much of” the country’s “discrimination legislation” (nothing to do with race mentioned). He then explained that he thinks that the situation as it is now, when “an employer is not allowed to choose between a British-born person and somebody from Poland is a ludicrous state of affairs” and clarified that an employer should be able to choose who he employs on the basis of “nationality” (clearly talking about what passport they hold, not race or ethnicity).

When pressed, he said that he thought laws against discrimination based on colour where no longer necessary (as they had been 40 years ago) and explained that UKIP as a party are “colour-blind”. 

Again, I don’t agree with him on much of what he said, but I can’t find any racism there, and I think his comments were pretty clear, given the constraints of the interview format. He also attempted to clarify his position afterwards, explaining that what he was talking about was “not a white v black thing”.

Barcelona initiated a new era in European football under Guardiola which launched Bayern and Real (and to a lesser degree Juve and PSG) on trajectories of European domination. /u/PappyPoobah was correct in his assessment that the EPL is changing and Liverpool can either be on the Europe ship or be left stranded as the best of the rest in the Premier League. I don't know if Klopp will be better than Rodgers but I do know that for the overall direction of the club sticking with Rodgers is a long-term strategy whereas signing Klopp will indicate a significant short-term investment. You don't bring in a manager with a large recruiting pull if you aren't going to back him financially to capitalize on that advantage.

I think in some ways you could compare the two to Wenger and Van Gaal. Wenger has been building his squad for years through the smart recruitment of young players that he then develops and often sells on to other clubs (Nasri, Fabregas, RVP, etc.). Van Gaal on the other hand comes into a bad situation at United and is given the keys to the castle and drops shit tons of money on Blind, Di Maria, Herrera, Shaw, Falcao, and Marcos Rojo and ""fixes"" United by putting them back in the CL.

There are 4 games remaining for us, and 5 games remain for Arsenal. We are currently 13 points ahead. We are unable to be caught by anyone but Arsenal (as City are in second, but have an identical number of points to Arsenal with one less game, they have a max of 12 points - not enough to catch us.) 

If Arsenal win their game in hand, we are 10 points ahead, leaving it mathematically possible for them to catch us. With 5 games, they would have to win all but one and draw the last or simply win all 5. The drawing method would leave it down to goal differential, while winning out would leave them with more points.

In order to prevent Arsenal from having any chance of catching us, we need 3 points. Two points leaves it to goal differential if Arsenal win out. 


So possible ways we can win:
1. We win any of our remaining 4 games.

At most we would of lost 10-15 points, but it wouldn't of have mattered considering champions league was not going to happen. Without sounding racist, I wanted the Arabs. Yes i know people dont want us to be one of those clubs, but in order to win titles in this current football era, you NEED money. Look at it like this, if we had rich arab owners they wouldn't necessarily be owner to generate huge profits, as they have so much money already, its more of a hobby. FSG on the other hand put this transfer committee in place so we sign players with high re-sell values. This is why we are stuck with so many young players who haven't really hit their peak yet. If you look at how liverpool have been under FSG, its like a cycle. We get a bunch of hit or miss talents, hoping that one or two will shine, making massive profits in the future, it is their job I know, but I want titles to shows for it. We could also blame Rodgers signings, but the transfer committee doesn't help in my opinion. Its sad but i think we do need new owners soon if the project keeps going through this cycle. We simply cant gamble on signing anymore, we need players who are world class now. Especially with the loss of gerrard, we need experience/class to fill that gap.

Too much of anything is generally bad. 

We seem to just look at youngsters who 'may' deliver. Who may turn out to be world beaters. That's OK. But the problem is we always look for youngsters who have hardly anything to go by. Can and Markovic being typical examples. Potential? Certainly. Previous experiences as clear, outstanding talents? Less so. I think it's about minimising this 'may' percentage by as much as possible. Suarez (I fucking hate having to mention him everytime, makes me look clingy) was scoring loads in Holland. Torres was tearing up the Liga and had shown it at the World Cup that year. That's what you want. Someone who has been doing it for atleast a decent amount of time (maybe 3 years? depends on the committee) 

Maybe the problem is we are too quick to judge our younger buys, or maybe we have this supreme ability to judge their talent and identify them as potential stars very quickly. 

I think Origi now is similar to what Torres was in terms of a buy at that time. Young, loaded with potential, had a decent World Cup, has scored goals in a below-par team (I say that loosely). We need to see how he turns out. To me at-least, it will tell me much more about our youngster-buying policy for the coming years.

You create two classes of mp which can cause spats of legitimacy.

It requires party lists which has a few perverse effects. It makes political parties a required part of the system and hands party HQ enormous power. The people who top the lists are safer than the safest safe seat. People in the middle get voted in and out regardless of what they do. People at the bottom mathematicaly can't get elected.
