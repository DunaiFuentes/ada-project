Thatcher's rotted corpse should be dug up and everyone should kick the shit out of it, her family should be terrorised and their lives made a living hell for what that bitch did.  None of you have any idea.  The 80's recession was made by her and her mates, all those suicides were her fault.  People were freezing to death in their homes because of her.

The easy way is to [do what the Belgians did in 1990](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/05/world/belgian-king-unable-to-sign-abortion-law-takes-day-off.html) when their king decided he could not, as a matter of conscience, approve an abortion law that had been passed by their parliament. He basically abdicated for 24 hours, allowing parliament to take emergency measures which involved them approving the law, after which the king resumed his reign a day later. Although there's no precedent in Britain for our monarch doing the same, there's nothing to say they can't, either. That's one of the advantages of not having a written constitution!

The hard way would be for the Queen to refuse to sign a law and also to refuse to play clever games like the one above to get round it. It's hard to know exactly what would happen but this time there IS a precedent -- the last time a King tried to tell Parliament that they were subject to his whims and not vice versa, he was forced into permanent exile in France and we found a more compliant monarch to pop onto the throne in his place.

What would happen this time round is completely unknown, and to be honest that's why it would never happen. Depending on what the specific law was and what the public mood was at the time, the monarch might be able to sail through the resulting constitutional crisis and come out the other side still on the throne, but it's more likely that they would be somehow forced to abdicate, and if things got really unpleasant it could even spell the end of the monarchy altogether. No King or Queen would want to go down in history as the one who forced the establishment of the Republic of Britain, so it's extremely unlikely they'd ever take that gamble",null,0,null,1430721274,null,0,false,0,cqxqjh6,null,t3_34snlr,null,t1_cqxqjh6,null,t3_34snlr,null,null,null,1432759636,null,13,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,13,null

The conflict had a significant impact on my mother, although I was not privy to that until recently, despite being aware of some mystery conflict within the extended family.  There are many family members I have never met because of this and I have spent most of my life guarded from the subject and shamefully naive as to the effects it has on my extended family.

&amp;nbsp;

My only memories are of going back to visit family in Galway and Belfast in the 80s, taking the ferry into Larne, seeing the military towers and crossing the checkpoints while going south, with their sniper outposts.  It was terrifying and confusing for a kid who was completely disconnected from what was happening.  Family would talk about other family I had never met, and leave me confused when I asked who they were.  I never joined the dots until later in life and went through a period of resenting my parents for shielding me from everything.

&amp;nbsp;

Where does that leave me, with respect to the IRA?  Every escalation has its roots in two or more parties with nothing but a strong difference of opinion, religious or otherwise.  If no resolution can be had amicably, some portion of one or more parties is going to escalate to violence and try to justify it by some means.  It's human nature.  Does that make it acceptable?  No, it does not.  Does that make retribution acceptable?  No.  Would my opinion be different if I had not moved to England, or if I had lost someone?  I don't know.

&gt;

&gt;A photograph may be described as *overexposed* when it has a loss of highlight detail, that is, when important bright parts of an image are ""washed out"" or effectively all white, known as ""blown out highlights"" or ""[clipped whites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(photography\))"".  A photograph may be described as *underexposed* when it has a loss of shadow detail, that is, when important dark areas are ""muddy"" or indistinguishable from black, 

&gt;known as ""blocked up shadows"" (or sometimes ""crushed shadows,"" ""crushed blacks,"" or ""clipped blacks,"" especially in video).    As the image to the right shows, these terms are technical ones rather than artistic judgments; an overexposed or underexposed image may be ""correct"", in that it provides the effect that the photographer intended. Intentionally over- or under- exposing (relative to a standard or the camera's automatic exposure) is casually referred to as ""shooting to the right"" or ""shooting to the left"", respectively, as these shift the histogram of the image to the right or left.

null,false,TheAntiqueTraveller,null,null,null,"The Queen sits in a odd place - she is lead of the legislature (parliament) and the executive (cabinet). It means she sometimes had to put different hats on.

Royal assent (ie the Queen giving consent) is a requirement of the passing of new legislation. By convention the Queen never denies royal assent *of her own accord* - that is an important point. 

Royal prerogative are a set of powers reserved for the monarch, and not within parliament's powers - eg the power to declare war. Again, by convention royal prerogative is now exercised by the executive (or cabinet). Therefore, the Queen will act in certain ways if she is told to by the executive.

Therefore, if parliament seeks to enact legislation that is within the realm of royal perogative she must give royal assent *unless* she is instructed not to by cabinet under royal perogative. 

A constitutional crises would only occur if the Queen refused to give royal assent in circumstances where she was not acting under the advice (really orders) of the cabinet. ""Conventions"" as mentioned above are an important part of UK constitutional law. The UK courts have held (in the context of Canada) that convention can become binding. Therefore, one solution may be for the court to find the Queen has acted outside of the law, and either she has to give royal assent or the court will order it is deemed to have been given or something similar. Therefore, I disagree with the point in your OP - the Queesn does not have the power to veto legislation of her own accord, as if she does the courts can step in.

And the word 'plastic' really fucks me off too. So often on here it's just used as an insult to put down someone's opinion when it doesn't fit the fantasy.

Sorry for the rant guysss :)

There's a separate argument about the impact of austerity vs increasing government spending and lowering taxes, which points to the fact that interest rates were (and are) at effective ZLB for the BoE and currently inflation is at a record low (we actually have very very small deflation last time I checked, dunno what the current figures are). So inflation not a worry while oil is low and borrowings not a worry when rates are low. 

Of course at some point you have to reign in a deficit, but as ours was caused by a drop in tax receipts not a rise in core spending, the focus first has to be improving growth and getting tax revenue back to where it was. It was too much too soon and we paid the price in growth. 

Also the UK has several areas that are in dire need of investment for the future, from current housing stock and new houses, to transport and energy infrastructure and flood defences.

2012- Cazorla

2013- Ozil

2014- Sanchez

Added to this is a second category of recruitment of undervalued players at a cheaper price. These players may be sixes or sevens when hey arrive but have enough space to develop into solid players: Koscielny, Giroud (looking a steal for 9 million now), Mertesacker (falls between marquee and second category for me) 

The third piece of puzzle is the gifted youth already at the club. The good thing is even when they under-perform (Wilshere, Ramsey to an extent this season) there's enough quality in the marquee purchases and second category purchases to cover for them. 

In fact the reason I think this is a smart system is there's cover everywhere: 

Big name player fails (Podolski)? It's okay, a youngster is having a phenomenal season and can fill in (Ramsey/Walcott). 

A youngster falls off his development trajectory (Wilshere)? They have marquee player (Cazorla) to take over. 

A marquee player is over-burdened in the middle of the season (Sanchez)? It's okay, a second category player steps up and fulfills his role (Giroud). 

A second category player is failing (Flamini)? It's okay, we have a promising youngster who's in good form (the Coq).

He's a very good young player, but as I've said before, Taarabt in the Championship managed 19 goals / 23 assists in 44 appearances. That's a far, far better record than Pritchard's had this season (12 goals / 7 assists in 45 appearances), so there is need for caution.

Pritchard does flit in and out of games, he is pretty selfish in possession, and he is not always the most diligent in tracking back. He's nowhere near the finished article.

Also worth remembering that he is fairly often behind Ince and Redmond in the pecking order for England U21s, and neither of those would be wanted by most Spurs fans.

But... all this said, he's a very accomplished technical player, and it'll be so exciting to have another young Academy player in the first team squad!",null,0,null,1430728006,null,0,false,0,cqxs72x,null,t3_34rcd1,null,t1_cqxs72x,null,t1_cqxrwul,null,null,null,1432760485,null,10,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,10,null

So, general admission tickets are definitely the cheapest you can get. If You want the full experience you can get the weekend ticket and camping at the silverstone woodlands campsite (which has excellent facilities, food, PUB, entertainment etc).

IMO there is only one real downside to general admission, and that is how early you have to be up to get the best spots. The gates open about 5am, but you need to be in the line any where up to 2 hours prior to that on race day.

My favourite place to watch from is down at club/abbey or at Stowe for good racing action, as well as being close to the campsite and and a good view of a big screen. 

You're cutting it VERY fine to buy anything other than general admission tickets now, so that might be your only option. I bought my grandstand tickets a couple of months ago and even back then I struggled to find two seats together! 

remember to take a portable radio and headphones so you can get the race commentary, as well as sun block and waterproofs!!

Of course there fucking will be. Will we be prepared for it? Of course we won't. Because building cash reserves is not a popular policy among idiotic voters.

The other problem caused by the labour, or perhaps just under the labour government, was the nature of the growth we experienced. Which was largely either within the public sector itself, lots of management getting nice promotions, which are unsustainable within recessions. And in the private world, much expenditure was financed by debt. Be it mortgages, sub-prime or otherwise, loans or credit cards.

...is just delusional.

The Conservatives came into office in 2010 promising to be a steady hand on the tiller. Promising to focus on fixing the deficit, ""to save the country"". But as soon as they got in they embarked on a series of radical and *ill managed* reforms, to health, education, and benefits.

It doesn't matter how desirable (or undesirable) their reforms were. Even if they had been good, and fair, and widely supported - that was not the time to be stirring things up. Any reorganisation will inevitably cause disruption and cost money. That's money we didn't have. Totally reorganising the NHS, without having any budget for it, was *bound* to be a disaster.

Pros: 
Decent beach along the main drag, gets a bit boggy as you go east then there's a nice quieter area behind Thorpe Park/Pleasure Island.  Plenty of chippies, cafés and pubs at the station end, Maccy D and KFC further down.  If you're driving and want somewhere quiet head down into Thorpe Park caravan park and park at the (free) carpark there.

Cons.

* Foreign students pay more tuition that UK students. They are an important revenue stream for UK universities. After graduating, some want to work in the UK, for example founding or joining tech startups. This is being made harder, and the number of foreign students is declining. 

* UK business is used to not having to pay or train skilled workers, and would now collapse if immigration of skilled workers were restricted. 

* Asylum seekers are governed by international treaties signed by the UK, and there aren't very many of them, but nevertheless the government has found ways of restricting their numbers.

* Which leaves immigration for family reasons, so the government has ruthlessly clamped down on this. But again there's not that many of these so people are being thrown under the bus for the sake of the government *appearing* to be tough on immigration.

Stalking licenses are also granted per region to help keep the numbers down.

EU lynx are forest hunters. They go after rabbits, foxes and other small mammals which in some cases include dogs. (Funnily enough sheep and cows aren't notorious for grazing in forests) The EU lynx is the largest of the Lynx family.

The Common European brown bear is an omnivore who'll eat anything especially if it's suspiciously fish shaped but their main diet is plants and insects though they have been known to attack young deer and sheep on occasion. Again the EU Brown prefers mountain forests. A potential problem with the brown is they wonder over large ranges of territory and are territorial.

Wolves (Yayy Puppies!) ... are wolves. They like deer a lot, claim large areas for the pack, again den up in forested areas and scare the shit out of people for no real reason. 

Even a few hundred wolves couldn't make a dent in Scotland's deer population but that was never the point behind the idea of reintroducing them.

Labour overspending **did not** cause RBS to buy ABN AMRO. Labour overspending **did not** cause Northern Rock to believe fund itself with short term paper, ^although ^Brown's ^claims ^of ^defeating ^Boom ^and ^Bust ^did ^play ^into ^this ^fallacy. Labour overspending **did not** force HBOS to ^buy ^into ^the ^same ^Brownite ^fallacy ^and overextend its balance sheet. Labour spending **did not** however force Lloyds to absorb HBOS ^although ^Gordon ^Brown ^did.

These are all actually quite specific failures based on individual leadership decisions. 

Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered were able to remain stable during the period, which implies that the theory is defunct.

However, Labour is far from absolved... in-fact, it's actually much worse.

Loop holes in regulation made London the global hub for underwriting the sub prime CDS market. So bespoke was this loophole that AIG only needed to position 3 key employees in London to authorise the practices which were much more tightly regulated in the US. 

It is not far fetched to claim that the US subprime crisis was only able to grow into a global crisis because of the role AIG's London office played in underwriting the Sub-Prime CDS market. 

To give context, when the crisis kicked in, AIG was unable to offload assets to raise cash in time, and needed a $100 bln bailout. 

The collapse of the US subprime debt market played into the freezing of credit markets, a la el cruncho credito, and then eurozone debt crisis (which is another story for another day) etc.

**Context is everything**

Financial markets are dominated by psychology. Herd mentality is so evident in financial asset price data that there are entire schools of analysis, dating back to the Osaka Rice Markets in 1700s Japan, that look for patterns in price as indicators of crowd psychology. 

Within the context of a calm, stable, perpetually growing economy, no, Labour did not overspend. 

Within the context of a panicked financial market, where Labour had to bailout half of the British banking sector, then yes, Labour spending in the build up to the crisis was considered bloated and dangerous to continue.

Labour, well at least Miliband and Balls, should never be trusted with the economy again because... 

1) Brown, closely supported by Balls and Miliband, genuinely believed their own hype. They believed that they had defeated the business cycle and boom and bust was obsolete. This is why they sold the gold at record lows... because they felt it a pointless asset to hold. They believed that debt could be perpetually issued and spending increased, in a Neo-Keynesian circle jerk.

2) Regulation was so poorly administered as to turn London into the petridish for global meltdown. Deregulation is not the problem. Bad regulation is the problem. The three stooges dismantled an established regulatary system and replaced it with something disfunctional and disjointed.

Capital is like water... It takes the shape of whatever you pour it into. If you have loop holes in regulation, the market will adjust to the new normal.

Less or more regulation is not the problem. Bad regulation is bad.

Look to the words of PIMCO, the world's then biggest bond manager, and also the company that Ed Balls' brother is the Chief Investment Officer of. In the build up to the last election, they described the UK's finances as apparently lying on a bed of nitroglycerine.

This was because bond vigilantes the world over - ie. tens of thousands of highly educated professionals coming together to form a market place, found universal sympathy in the view that a Labour re-election and Labour policies, set within the potential context of a global economic crisis and a european debt crisis, could lead to structural instability, and systemic vulnerability should crisis contagion take place.

Best way to check is sign up to Experian.co.uk (1st month free) and check your credit rating, it will give a pretty comprehensive overview of where you can improve it. They have a credit matching tool where they match you up with products (credit cards, loans, mortgages) which you are likely to be accepted for based on your score.
You need to ensure you don't make lots of credit applications in a short space of time or it will decrease your score and take 6 months to stop affecting it. Having previous history of settling small amounts of credit will help, definitely recommend checking out the website and seeing what your score is. Often the best credit cards, lowest interest loans etc seem to be restricted to those with the best scores whereas people with lower scores (like myself) are eligible for the higher interest products until I improve my score - not sure if that's 100% true but it's seemed that way to me.

1) Its an Amex card, so that means only about 50% of places that normally accept credit cards will accept it, personally I'd apply for another to use when you can't use the Amex

N.B. You don't say what you're earning but personally unless you're on £35k+ I wouldn't apply for this credit card. As a first CC application its likely it won't be accepted, amex are picky as fuck and you have no score, a failed application negatively affects your credit score. imo you should apply for a CC with your bank or with a supermarket, it will be more useful because it will be MC or VISA and you won't get turned down, then apply for the amex if you want.

See above. It's largely mechanical.

&gt; a government shouldn't be able to use the monarchy to do something that shouldn't be in their power.

Control of royal prerogative powers is one of the defining powers of the government.  There are centuries of history around the gradual transfer of the control of those powers.

Define need.  The position of the monarch is integral to the whole constitution.  Rip it out and the whole machine stops working.

one of the major developments in the last 20 years is politicians are now coached to avoid committing to anything or answering questions interviewers put to them. If you ask a politician from any major party ""are you going to increase or decrease tax if you win the election?"", they'll answer something infuriating like ""look, I think the real issue here is what is right for the economy right now..."" without answering the fucking question.

This is probably in part because the press is so aggressive in the UK that if a politician promises something and then doesn't deliver if it turns out not to be the right decision in the future, the press savages them for it.

All the main parties have committed to cutting the budget deficit, but none will say how. How the fuck are we supposed to decide who to vote for then??? Raise taxes or cut spending? Think we can't swallow the answer? Which is it? WHICH IS IT?

So I, like many others, am spitting mad. I'll vote anyone except these cowards.  And that's what makes this election interesting. That we're ready to vote for loonies instead of the main parties because we're bored of them. And we're bored because bloody-minded evasiveness, which used to be just one tool in the politician's toolbox for when they were really stuck, is now the norm.

I'd kill for a politician who wants to bomb iran, thinks gay marriage is an abomination and wants to cut taxes to 9%.

So basically they spent their first three years in office wiping out a Tory deficit, hardly sounds reckless to me

Gah, this has the makings of a great post, but this is one of several misunderstandings or misinformations about history. That Daily Mail article needs debunking, but is undermined if there's flaws in it. I can't reply to them all - several others have already, anyway - so I'll reply to this howler. 

Gordon Brown didn't ""wipe out the Tory deficit"". The Clarke/Major spending plan had the deficit to be almost eliminated by 1999. This is very well documented and is also clear from the deficit trajectory going into 1997. 

Gordon Brown stuck to the Clarke/Major plan in the first 2.5-3 years of government, and then launched the Brown spending plan: amping up public spending (and borrowing) from 2000 afterwards to reboot and reinvigorate public infrastructure and services which were decaying.

Commitment to a large standing army, a navy of large warships around our coastline, squadrons of fighter planes and a cripplingly expensive missile defence system is therefore unnecessary.

null,false,segagamer,eng-Surrey,Croydon,null,"&gt; Yes, people should work for their keep, but most people in the UK are not working for an amount ...... this kind of money?  Not too many.

That's due to reasons outside of the Tory government.

&gt; Also, you descend from generations spanning thousands of years, many of whom fought and ...... die screaming in agony.

Many of which needed updating anyway, and the policies you're arguing for never worked well anyway.

&gt;If you want to live in a country where everyone must work else they starve and die, why don't you pack your bags and move to India? 

Because their culture is dictated by a religion which laws I do not agree with either.

&gt; One that doesn't discriminate against anyone for any reason. That's what I want. 

Good luck trying to get the Muslims to agree to that. 

&gt; It sounds like you'd be happier living in Afghanistan, why don't you trot over there instead.

Again, because their culture is dictated by their religion which laws I do not agree with.

I know it's nice how you essentially want to live in a sort of communist country, where wealth is a whole lot more balanced, regardless of the effort made towards their living, or where everyone gets on because they're okay with each others beliefs. But the fact is, as lovely as that sounds on paper *neither of those things work in practice*. If we placed a Gay Bar in Tower Hamletes or Whitechapel, do you think the community there would be so accepting? How do you propose to implement equal rights for women with people who hold such beliefs? Are we to not penalize husbands who smack their wives simply because their beliefs dictate it's okay? I'm not sure if this is actually illegal yet, but do you think forced/arranged marriages should still be a thing?

As you can see, there's just too many clashes with *our* culture in order for it to work. So if they want to move to the UK, then they must *integrate* into our society. **NOT** form a huge ghetto that wants to work under its own laws like Islam has and is doing.

These sections of society do not seem to understand that ""representation"" is not something to be metered.  As an example, people bang on about black and minority representation on telly and then go on about how few ""minorities"" there are in mainstream telly.

Personally, as a white bisexual scientifically minded male, there has never been ANYONE who has ever represented me on screen.  My interest in the sexuality and ethnicity of characters is related to their purity.  Meaning if a great character is a black gay man and they reboot the series with him as a white straight woman, I will be rather annoyed unless they go in a really good direction with the character, in which case I will accept the alternative idea.

Best example of this I can think of is Starbuck, who was a really good, engaging character.

People need to stop banging on about representation and start banging on about good storytelling or engaging television.  I watched Top Gear because it was the only time on telly that I ever saw a few blokes dicking about in a way that most blokes would love to dick about.

That wasn't car porn.  It wasn't hypermasculinity.  It was companionship and adventure.  Three blokes venturing off into the unknown in ridiculous circumstances and being incompetent along the way.  Top Gear was the perfect British programme.  We love to be shit but somehow succeed.

It's no surprise that a show about three blokes being excited and happy and laughing their way through ridiculous adventures while looking like complete idiots was so successful.  The modern Mary Whitehouses will never allow this to happen with a woman on the show.  It would be misogyny then.

In fact, I'm not sure it will happen but (as OP asked for) I think it's something which needs more discussion. A couple of examples of how these computers could do the professions out of work:

&gt; Watson is already capable of storing far more medical information than doctors, and unlike humans, its decisions are all evidence-based and free of cognitive biases and overconfidence. It's also capable of understanding natural language, generating hypotheses, evaluating the strength of those hypotheses, and learning — not just storing data, but finding meaning in it.

&gt; “[Artificial intelligence] and robotics will revolutionize the legal sector,” says Tony Williams, founder of Jomati Consultants, a leading British-based strategic consultancy to the legal profession. “Law firms will see nearly all their process work undertaken by AI bots, completely upending the traditional associate leverage model.” ... David Holme, chief executive officer of Exigent Group Ltd., a global legal services outsourcer and consultancy headquartered in South Africa, says that’s already happening.

Then, of course, all the drivers who have had one of the most secure jobs in the world - what happens when trains, taxis, delivery vans, HGVs, etc are being increasingly robotised? I don't think it will happen overnight because it will be expensive, but eventually it will become more expensive to hire and insure humans rather than give the work to a robot which comes with the ""Google Guarantee - Less than One Incident per Million Miles!""

So you're right, communities now could do with more hands. But imagine if there were so many people out of work that wasn't true any more. What will people do with themselves, and will the work ethic mean anything in these circumstances? People who very much want to work and have assumed the work will always be there will find they are unemployed.

There are knock-on effects as well - if so many people are living on the minimum, who can businesses sell to? How can governments raise taxes? Do we return to local barter economies, using the ""Manchester/Liverpool/Birmingham Pound"" or whatever (which some towns already do) to keep the money local? Will we be out there smashing the looms again?

I can't predict the future, but imagine the pool of work halves, then halves again, in the next 20-40 years. What will our societies look like?

Alternatively, I'd say we'll have to play 4 at the back because Chelsea play with width using Ivanovic and Hazard. Playing 3 at the back would leave us woefully exposed if we got caught up the field or one of our wing backs didn't track back.  

Lucas/Allen in the middle is a must to try and stifle Fabregas/Willian/Oscar/Ramires or whoever Chelsea turn up with. Preferably Lucas because he is less likely to go forward.  

Midfield of Lucas/Henderson/Lallana/Coutinho/Sterling/Ibe. Movement, skill and high pressing to hopefully catch Matic and the other midfielders is the only way I can see us breaking down the Chelsea back line.  

Perhaps Lambert up top again but I don't see him having the same success or time on the ball as he did against QPR so he might end up a passenger. I think we play 6 in the midfield with Sterling or Coutinho in the forward role and we press high and break, meaning we can break with 5 (Henderson, Coutinho, Lallana, Sterling, Ibe) but also defend with 5 in an emergency (Johnson, Skrtel, Lovren, Moreno and Lucas in holding mid).

&gt;#Aston Villa Review: Episode 119 - Villa dominate Everton to take three vital points
When Leicester City hammered Newcastle United on Saturday there was a sense amongst Aston Villa supporters that it might not be the best result for Tim Sherwood's side. There was, though, one way to turn it into the best possible outcome from that lunchtime kick-off: beat Everton and overtake both of them. Villa did just that with a 3-2 victory at Villa Park, a victory whose scoreline flattered not the victors but the visitors.

&gt;Goals from Christian Benteke and Tom Cleverley edged Villa closer to Premier League safety, and the focus of this week's Aston Villa Review is an assessment of Saturday's win. We discuss Villa's goalkeeping situation and renewed ability to win matches in midfield, and look tentatively ahead to another home game this coming Saturday afternoon. Can Villa take another three points against West Ham United to consolidate their position at the top of the bottom?",null,0,null,1430738019,null,0,false,0,cqxucuu,null,t3_34t961,null,t1_cqxucuu,null,t3_34t961,null,null,null,1432761504,null,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2,null

kinda like shouting ""I object!"" At a wedding when the minister asks if anyone can think of any lawful impediment to the union, the idea is you discuss this well in advance in private with the parties concerned to prevent this kind of impass.

in the event all protocol broke down and the monarch vetoed a bill, it would not result in ""revolution"". That would require people wanting to fight, something that isn't predicated on the veto occuring. The most likely result is that parliament would simply move to pass a law sidestepping the queen's authority. 

Worst case scenario os the monarch would be impeached, and the royal family will join the hundreds if not thousands of royal families around the world deposed from power completely and left to rot with their titles and meagre pensions.

Problem is that this actually is a conspiracy that happens to be true.

I've a friend training to be a paramedic (nowadays that involves a medical degree and lots of vocational training ((i.e. responding to actual emergencies while training)).

The tender for non-essential ambulance provision (outpatient cases) went to Arriva instead of the North West Ambulance Service in 2013.

[This is the result](http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/patients-suffer-arrivas-ambulances-miss-6527777)

They won because they were cheaper, *yay!!* Problem is, they were cheaper because they have fewer ambulances and less experienced staff who they can pay less.

&gt;As part of the ‘core’ contract demands, Arriva must drop 90 per cent of patients off for appointments between 45 minutes early and 15 minutes late.
&gt;
&gt;But the figures reveal it only managed 67pc in April, 62pc in May, 60pc in June, 64pc in July, 66pc in August, 67pc in September and 63pc in October.
&gt;
&gt;Arriva is also supposed to pick up 80pc of patients to take them home within 60 minutes of the scheduled collection time.
&gt;
&gt;But it only managed 73pc in April, 71pc in May, 68pc in June, 69pc in July, 71 pc in August, 73pc in September and 70pc in October.

I *could* go back home to Cardiff and earn £45K or so, but why bother when I can earn much more in London?

I'd also like to make a somewhat bold claim: London is cheaper than anywhere else in the UK - excluding house prices obviously.

Reasoning? Everyday stuff like a pint of milk, a tin of beans or a newspaper costs the same everywhere in the UK. A car costs the same, a laptop costs the same, and a TV is the same price. But the wages are 25% higher or even double in some cases.

Therefore, *as a percentage of income*, it's cheaper to buy a car, groceries, household items, and electrical goods when you live in London.

It's true that the rent is higher, but since living in London I've been able to save for the first time, I have spare money to donate to my preferred charity (Refuge), and my credit rating has shot up.

I'll likely leave in a year or two because my company allows me to work remotely, and that gives me a dream situation of living/working in a rural part of Wales on a London wage, but I'd still recommend that anyone in the IT industry moves here for a few years to try it out and maybe put some pennies away to save for a deposit on a house *not* in London.",null,0,null,1430738620,null,0,false,0,cqxuikx,null,t3_34syk7,null,t1_cqxuikx,null,t1_cqxu5mn,null,null,null,1432761578,null,46,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,46,null

Labour: Initially balances the books, but a global financial crisis causes the economy to stumble. After implementing some interpretations of the Labour manifesto and the global economy stabilises, starts making a surplus (in the tune of £70billion). National debt payed off, science funding increased, all the capitalists flee the country due to the anti-capitalist policies. Game ends with Britain being a egalitarian, socialist, productive, high-tech utopia.

Conservatives: Welfare is cut and it doesn't look like much can be done as all cuts are balanced by increasing spending towards pensions and business initiatives. Same crisis leads to more cuts. Attempts to balance the budget lead to all demographics hating him as its cuts across the board. Game ends with the country being highly productive, technologically advanced and green. However, there are high crime rates due to poverty, equality plummets, health collapsing... this ultimately leads to them polling at 0% in the election and losing.

Lib Dems: Initially introduces wealth tax and increases child benefit, and increase education funding, and slashing the military. Budget is balanced... until the crisis hits. Eventually stabilises the economy (though 6 months after Labour did). Game ends with them being hated by the religious, rich, capitalists and patriots but loved by everyone else and with a stable budget.

Green: Initially introduces wealth and corporation tax. Taxes on alcohol, drugs and cigarettes actually drive up poverty. In a bizarre twist, although the global financial crisis happens, the UK isn't affected at all. Credit rating actually gets upgraded during the global recession.... However then everything kicks in, everyone is taxed to death, GDP plummets, unemployment goes to 100% - the fleeing of the rich and corporations literally destroys the economy. Greens get defeated in the next election though not as badly as the Tories did.

UKIP: Runs into an initial hurdle that Democracy 3 doesn't simulate the EU and most of UKIP's funding policies simply don't exist in the game. Spending cuts to the best of the author's ability are made to close the gap, but all the extra spending on military, border controls and crime control leads to a large budget deficit (even if the £12billion saved by leaving the EU were factored in). Lower public education funding and cutting of all green tech leads to a skills shortage. The proposed tax cuts tip the country over the edge into a debt crisis. They get defeated in the next election.

**Caveats -** The author clearly has a left-wing bias (important as at times he has to make creative interpretations of the manifesto to get round the fact that either the manifesto pledge was too vague or the game couldn't simulate it directly). In particular, he admits he was way too generous in the way he interpreted the Labour manifesto. The Labour simulation also went on for longer than the others (if he had stopped just at the first term, it would have left in roughly the same condition as the Lib Dems).


tl;dr of the tl;dr - Labour and Lib Dems win, Greens initially do well before failing horribly, Tories do well economically but socially are so bankrupt they end up hated by everyone and UKIP lose completely (though UKIP ends up less hated than the Tories).",null,0,null,1430738845,null,0,1430739085,0,cqxuksv,null,t3_34syyo,null,t1_cqxuksv,null,t3_34syyo,null,null,null,1432761608,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The younger players we brought in this season have had a season to get used to the league and new environment, so naturally we'll get improvement from there. In addition to that our young squad is year older and more experienced starting the next season and that gives us a head start when compared to current season. Sterling, Coutinho, Henderson are improving all the time, I expect them to be even better next season. And for example players like Can, Markovic don't need another half a season to just get used to the team, so we can use them right away and they will be more ready to give us performances right away.

Also, I expect couple of more experienced players to have much better seasons next year, specifically Lallana and Sturridge.

Also, Gerrard on the bench. Admittedly he doesn't have the pace and energy anymore. We can bring him on after the hour mark as players start to tire. 

I feel we should play 3 at the back. We lost 2 games against quality sides (Arsenal, United) and we abandoned the system which was working for us. Honestly, with four at the back we don't seem much threatening. QPR are so poor that it worked in favour of us. Plus, a lone striker in front with a back four renders our team bland - no creativity. With 3 at the back and Lucas upfront we can create chances. Chelsea are going to play typical Chelsea - wait for a mistake and capitalise. If we want to win we have to attack! To bolster the defense we can play a double midfield pivot - Henderson can help Lucas alongside as he has the legs to play box-to-box.

Religious demographics in northern ireland are really confusing. In catholic strongholds you see a reduction of Catholicism and a increase of protestantism and in protestant strongholds you see a increase of Catholicism and reduction of protestantism which is pretty confusing. I done a bit of research into it after the sinn fein census fiasco. Some of the catholic increase can be explained by immigration, catholics being more loyal to their faith(http://gyazo.com/827062986aae5aa7d952ab851ec16385) and a natural increase. The decline in protestantism is mainly defections to the non-religious section.

http://gyazo.com/fe79193475137ee3d0425a9fbff2a37e While its in Catholics religion to disprove of contraception I don't think it can explain the rise of catholcis population. As throughout history the catholic population has gone up and down and the protestant population too. Its important to note that from 1971 to 1991 and maybe 2001 the catholic population was probably much more that stated as they protested the census. Its near impossible to predict the future religious make up of NI and very dangerous to predict the political future of northern ireland like sinn fein did in north belfast.

Yes, but we live in a global economy and right now without major tax increases the standard of living in the UK would fall, and the countries infrastructure would suffer, if they were not operating in deficit. 

Let me put it this way, is it a bad idea for someone to being a buisiness, buy a house, get a car etc using money that they don't have but will be able to recoup over time? I and most of the world would say no, it's not a bad idea to spend money you don't yet have on something that will provide worth over time. 

The money that the government spends is doing just that. When they invest in the NHS, social welfare and other big tax expenditures they are using the money that they have, and some that they don't in order to make the future better. Now does this have some risk? Yes, but not as much as you might think, especially because we live in a global world. The UK is a strong nation, we have lots of dealings with other countries and as a result we are interdependent on them and they are on us (this is partially why the US debacle hurt the UK so much). So the UK is very unlikely to fall to ruins because of this nature. 

Now some people will point to Greece and say well look at them! The problem with that is that the government of Greece hired foreign companies to hide their problems so they could get something they wanted. The UK doesn't do that, nor will it ever because 1) we are stronger and 2) we recognize that such short term cut and run tactics will destroy the country (something that governments don't tend to want to do).

Fair point, but they shouldn't be so easily swayed by a comedian to change their entire position on both voting and party support a few days before the general election. Anyone predisposed to flip flop in such a manner should have had the common sense to register in case of this eventuality.

Don't forget the other key constituent part of any Miliband government is going to be ED BALLS who, like Brown, in the weeks and months just before the financial crisis claiming Labour had ended boom and bust. Who presided over the maintaining and strengthening of a system that let the city of London essentially do whatever the fuck it wanted.

I thought Lambert was excellent against QPR, but I don't think Chelsea are going to afford him the kind of space that they did. I think we need to be going at them from the first second, let Lallana and Markovic give Coutinho options ahead of him, if it looks like we'll need a plan B then take Manquillo off for Lambert and let Markovic drop back to RWB and have Coutinho and Lallana feed Rickie.

This season has really converted me to team Nabil and I'm hoping he'll have an illustrious career with us. 

The Luka comparison is fitting, though Modric's dribbling is eons better than Bentaleb's. Not to say Bentaleb's is poor, necessarily. Only that he doesn't have that Modric flair. 

The difficult thing is that Bentaleb would seem to work best in a 4-3-3. In the Barca system (with them playing Busquests, Rakitic, and Iniesta), NB would take the Rakitic position. He gets forward, but he isn't the attacking threat of Iniesta, but he also doesn't sit in front of the CBs for added protection like Busquests. 

For PSG (in their Motta, Verratti, Matuidi system), he'd be the Verratti role. 

I think Modric is actually the perfect player in this role. Verratti is developing into a wunderkind at it as well. 

I'm a bit nervous that we will try to force him into being either the Iniesta or the Busquets role, neither of which he seems capable of right now, simply because of the way we are set up.

In general, Queen's Consent is sought for bills that affect either certain interests of the Royal Family, or the royal prerogative. The former refers to various private sources of income held by the Queen or the Prince of Wales, mostly related to land.

The latter is more interesting - the Queen allows HM Government or parliament to exercise some, but not all, of her sovereign powers for her, and any bills seeking to modify these arrangements must be approved, by the Queen, prior to being debated in parliament.

The monarch has not refused Royal Assent in the UK [since 1708](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Militia_Bill), but in 2013 it was revealed that Queen's Consent [plays a far greater role in modern politics than most people realised](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/14/secret-papers-royals-veto-bills), and was refused on [at least three occasions since 1990](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/pamphlet-on-royal-consent-legislation-published-8452548.html).

In 1999, at the request of the government, she used it to block [a bill requiring parliamentary approval for any future military action in Iraq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Action_Against_Iraq_%28Parliamentary_Approval%29_Bill).

I'm a student, haven't got a credit card yet. But what you said about failed applications has got me slightly worried.

When I turned 18, my mother told me to get all the reward cards (Nectar, Tesco Clubcard etc.) so naturally when I was offered one at a store I got one.

Cue a few weeks and being young(er) and naive a cute girl at the checkout in debenhams asked if I wanted their store card. Obviously I thought she meant a rewards card, but it was actually a credit card. They got me to fill in some forms but it didn't seem much different to the Nectar card forms so I went along merrily. Then by the time they started ringing up the card company and I realised what was happening, it was too late. 

I had a job but warning £200 a month isn't enough to get a card, obviously. So it was rejected.

I've had a few issues with cash flow in the past (not being paid and so direct debits have been delayed) too, but they were all sorted out as soon as I had the money.

Have to say I think any right-minded fan will always be happy to see the club grow in popularity, however at least personally I'm always keen that those fans also arrive intending to support the club in the right way. What I mean by that is through thick and thin, for every season like this there will be one (or more) of total frustration and not winning anything. More importantly than that, for those foreign fans that do make it to a game - don't be another fucking tourist taking selfies while we're going through on goal. Everyone hates those people, and rightly so.

The phrase 'where were you when we were shit?' comes up often when it comes to new fans, and I do sympathise with that in the sense that it's immensely frustrating as a long-term fan to go to games and feel the atmosphere lacking due to Johnny-come-lately fans but it's also important to understand that not all new fans are like that.

Just to be clear, this comes on the back of Sturgeon failing to censure a candidate for anonymously attacking people on Twitter, and senior SNP people suggesting that it's okay to intimidate politicians (specifically, Margaret Curran). There was also the anonymous death threat to a Labour candidate, although obviously we don't know if they were pro-SNP. It doesn't exactly seem unlikely, however.

With Rupa Huq being manhandled by some Tory and the Tory protesters punching Ed a few weeks ago, Labour are definitely having a bit of a rough time out on the streets but I think it may actually ultimately work in our favour, like the various verbal and written attacks levelled at Ed's personality and/or kitchenette.

&gt;Let’s look at the facts – the way things are, not the way we might like things to be. The way things are, the great majority of Protestants vote for unionist candidates, the great majority of Catholics vote for nationalist/republican candidates. (I’m not talking about non-voters here, since that’s a separate issue). But when a Catholic casts a vote for Gerry Kelly, he’s not doing so to announce his or her commitment to the doctrine of transubstantiation. And when a Protestant casts his/her vote for Nigel Dodds, s/he is not doing so  with a notion that this will reflect their devotion to the Westminster Confession of Faith. The Catholic may have many reasons for voting as s/he does but they’re almost certainly political; the Protestant ditto.

I go in there, look, swatch, explore a little bit and make a note of stuff that stands out. Then, if by the time I get home I still like the product enough (and if I have money haha),  I go try find it on the internet. 

I think amazon has a good range but if its not on there, I tend to go to Superdrug. I hardly ever end up buying from Boots cause its almost always cheaper somewhere else unless they have a good deal. 

A good example is Real Techniques sets, 20ish pounds at boots and super drug if there isn't a deal on, a quick search on hotukdeals.com found that they were on sale at a chemists for about £11.50, on amazon for £13/14 pounds. I have prime so I always tend to go for amazon where possible! 

With higher end stuff though I am really wary of buying on amazon. I have received fake things from Amazon Warehouse before and it really put me off. The MAC counterfeit market is massive so I tend to buy from Debenhams/House of Fraser/Selfridges. These big department stores from now and again will have 10% vouchers, so I wait for one of those and will get whatever I need!

I have heard of feelunique and a few other similar online retailers but their prices are nearly the same so unless they've got a deal on, I will probably stick to what I do at the moment! 

I will add though that I really like Superdrug as opposed to Boots. I like all these budget brands that they carry, the Boots 17, No. 7 and natural collection brands really don't compare. I'm loving Sleek, MUR, GOSH and a couple of others at the moment.

Most departments don't deviate from their typical unless there have been particular circumstances that may have affected your grades, or they use a range based off subject choices or similar factors.


They also *give out far more offers than places* so you may be looking at 750 applicants to 600 offers or something - no idea on the actual number as it'll be based off historic figures of how many people firm and their expectations. I used to help with open days so I got insight into figures, so my dept has something like ~960 applicants, but then only ~220 or so actually firmed or insured, and even then they modelled only 150 of those would probably meet the offer. I don't know how many were given an offer out of the 960. Chances are, you'll get an offer if your predictions are alright (and don't look out of place versus other grades - i.e. an E at AS to a A* at A2 isn't really believable) and meet the typical.


Depending on resource they may also take more students, as they get additional funding for extra students with decent grades so it's effectively unlimited. So long as you get BBB or above you're in that group so even if you don't think you'll make the offer there is flexibility to let you in. It will depend on how many other students are accepted on the day though.

tbh I'm at Southampton, a fairly comparable university in terms of rankings, doing History, and I got ABB at A-level, although I had a fairly major accident during exam week so that might have altered things a bit.

The one piece of advice for your personal statement is that it's best to really go overboard on demonstrating what draws you to the subject.

So the terms Unionist and Republican would have been better suited to his stupid leaflet. Or Unionist Republican/Nationalist probably - I  can never remember the exact nuance between R and N.  

The leaflet even mentioned ""brought up as"" - how fucking entrenched do you have to be to continue with that - that's the most infuriating thing to me about ""equality"" in this country. Your family name, who your parents are, what school you went to, what religious community you were brought up in - matter. And not just in a sectarian on the street pronounce ""h"" way - in an official devolved government policy way. 

You seem to be using the same argument as me - you think the leaflet is distasteful but also disagree with unionists. I just didn't understand the straw man unionist you were using. Of course unionists are hypocrites.

But something about this sub seems to usually make SFs hypocrisy just fade away - there've been a few times on this sub I've seen the ""when the bloodied old guard go it will stop Unionists having ammunition against republicanism"". Maybe it will - but the old guard haven't gone away and they're still being bigots. I'm happy to point that out - Gerry Kelly is a sectarian bigot - he is using identity politics to shore up votes and I'm sure if a politician did the same for ""males/females"", ""blacks/whites"", ""Christian/Muslim"" so blatantly they'd be through politically.

UK pollsters have long adjusted for known anomalies in our voting patterns, like shy Tories and low turnout in Labour-held seats, but they don't know what -- if any -- kinds of anomalies might be thrown up by the rise of the SNP, Ukip and so on. So a lot of polls could be way off. The fact that the Scottish polls show an SNP lead of anything from 18-points to 34-points suggests that, while the SNP are pretty clearly enormously ahead, something's gone wrong in someone's methodology. We won't know what until May 8th. The Guardian was suggesting that even the exit polls will be 'wrong' because of the rise of newer parties, even in Scotland.

If you're going to get ABB or AAB this year in the subjects you want to carry on then you should be able to convince your teachers to bump up your predictions for next year to AAA.

But even without the grades (I was predicted A\*AC and I applied to courses with A\*AA requirements) your personal statement can get you offers. 

Remember the universities give out more offers than places because they know that many won't accept their offers and some will miss out on the grades. Although you can usually talk your way in if you miss out by a single grade.

Your personal statement is the key imo. It should be about 70% academic related (why you want to do history, what you've done to show further interest eg; extended reading, relevant trips, etc.) and 30% extra curricular (sport and so on). If you get that nailed, you'll get offers. I did UCAS twice, out of the 10 unis I applied to, I didn't have the predicted grades for any of them, but I got 9 offers. I put that down to my personal statement. 

So this summer, read history books on areas you're interested in, maybe visit some historical sites if you can. And start working on your personal statement now, because it's a lot easier to do now than in September when you need to send it off ASAP.

I doubt many applicants have relevant work experience, other than if there are any museums or historic events around your area you can volunteer at. I would just discuss a couple of books you've read and talk about why the area interests you - either generally, or use a specific historic period. Their main concerns are likely whether or not you'll have the motivation to study and succeed - you don't have many contact hours so an interest in your subject outside of what you're taught in class is desirable.


You can also briefly sell skills from your other subjects - if you're doing anything that does involve analysing or similar skills (like maths, or presumably psychology and other subjects with case studies in). If you want to add hobbies in there focus on the skills it displays - like if you've been playing a sport for X years then talk about the commitment to it, the dedication and motivation. Hobbies are not important at the end of the day though, so if you can't spare the words for them then don't bother.

With the success that he has been there, I would think that Viola would argue that 18Mill would be a bargain considering they got cash for the deal, and he has been what they needed on the pitch.

IF (and a big one at that) Viola do not go for him, there is NO WAY Chelsea are selling anyone to Spurs.  They went out of their way to buy him so he does not end up going to Liverpool, even at the expense of sitting him on the bench all that time.

I just realized **Superdrug Simply Pure Hydrating Serum** clogs me. :_____0 Damn capric/caprylic triglyceride! So I switched back to **SebaMed Clear Face Care Gel** and the clogs and milia went away. But it doesn't seem to do much for my irritated face. My face still hurts at night when I put this on after taking off sunscreen and cleansing.

&gt; &gt;he was completely correct on western cold war propaganda demonizing soviet Russia's part in WW2.
 
&gt; I don't think any reasonable person would rely on Cold War propaganda from either side to reach an understanding of WWII. Pretty irrelevant straw man concocted to support his filmsy assertions on the Brits &amp; our Allies.

You've completely misinterpreted my argument; there was obviously an inherent need from the Soviets to have a second front, they clearly needed it. The War would not have been won otherwise. The rest of the Allied forces held back for as long as they could and when they did enter initially they went to peripheral sites of battle to secure strategic interests. They should have opened a second European front much sooner. These are not flimsy assertions but a matter of historical record. 

&gt; On balance a mixture of decidedly pro nat and anti-British points. You could say the converse about my unionist standpoint, except I don't insult people's intelligence with the pretence I'm offering a neutral POV. Which leads me to your last sentence:

From both camps however it is rare to see.

I draw a distinction between overt and covert homophobia, I can tolerate covert, covert in the sense that they may think it, they may say it amongst their own but they don't chase people down in the streets, whatever but when you target the life of someone just because they do not live by your ideology, that's a different matter. And no, I couldn't give the slightest shit about what happens to people who dictate to others how to live in matters that simply don't involve them, including skinning them alive and sewing them up in a pig.

I wish no harm upon those who respect the nature of others in these regards and it is an annoyance to have to clarify that after already saying exactly that, like I have to every time.

Yes this is true, but he sold it 15 years ago when it was at its lowest price for 20 years, and shortly before a huge increase. He also announced the sale before he put it on the market!! Please. Look into it a bit more before you insist it was a good move.

&gt;The sale of UK gold reserves was a policy pursued by HM Treasury over the period between 1999 and 2002, when gold prices were at their lowest in 20 years, following an extended bear market. 

&gt;The advance notice of the substantial sales drove the price of gold down by 10% by the time of the first auction on 6 July 1999.

&gt;Brown's actions have attracted considerable criticism, particularly concerning his timing, his decision to announce the move in advance, and the use of an auction. The decision to sell gold at the low point in the price cycle has been likened[who?] to the mistakes in 1992 that led to Black Wednesday, when the UK was forced to withdraw from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, which HM Treasury has estimated cost the UK taxpayer around £3.3 billion.[1]

I am in Hammersmith where current polling suggests Labour are about 12 points ahead and it should be a safe seat. However, the Tories have been out a *lot* in recent weeks and local polling data can easily be off by a significant margin. As such however I vote might matter - it could be more marginal here than polls suggest.

I think the Tories have screwed up, but might be more competent at the economy. I think the Lib Dems screwed up but I believe in their values more than other parties. I think Labour will do well in terms of the NHS and investing in public services (which will help the economy), but I am not sure of their competency. I like the Greens but they have screwed up their manifesto by dropping the pledge to a Universal Basic Income and so now I question their sense of authority and ability to act.

Because it's a tight seat, I'm likely to vote Labour: I'm more a leftist, Miliband has impressed me in recent weeks.

That's the biggest difference between this year and last: the ability to win games 1-0. We've won 7 games 1-0 this year, in oppose to just 1 last season (which included Europa). Some of our hardest earned points came in games that we drew on the road, 0-0 at Goodison, 0-0 at the Stadium of Light. These are games that we would have lost in the previous season, but the defensive solidity that Monk's brought to the side gives us a chance to get something from every game. 

In terms of the mass summer exodus, I don't think anyone was massively worried because there was clearly a rift in the dressing room that needed to be fixed. The Spanish contingent that came in under Laudrup was dependent on Laudrup and was unwilling to carry on under Garry. When Lukasz Fabianski was brought in on a free, we all knew that meant the end for Michel Vorm, whose form hadn't been top notch and who'd been struggling through injury. Cañas, Pozuelo, Vasquez were all on the fringe at the end of last season, so it wasn't surprising to see them exit. Hernandez's form was sporadic and Chico Flores was, well, Chico Flores. Most upsetting was the exit of Ben Davies because he's a loyal servant and a local lad, but I don't think anyone could refute that Huw Jenkins got the better of that deal with Levy. Arguably the most important bit of business that Garry/Huw did last summer was persuading Bony to stay until January, also signing a new contract with the club which some reckon removed his release clause ahead of the move to City.

Our strikers are abysmal and we're about to add a young lad who hasn't been anything special in the French league to the options.  We will probably add another striker but there is no guarantee that he won't be as useless as Balotelli or as broken as Sturridge. 

Going on transfer market form rather than faith, there is no reason to assume that anyone signed over the summer will be an improvement.

I'm not going to say how much I earn, but I pay for a pretty small 1-bet flat in West Acton for £1100 per month.

Pros: I get BT fibre internet here and I'm really close to the tube station so it's easy to get to work or go into central if I want.

Cons: It's a semi-terraced house turned into flats. Unfortunately the landlord forgot about an important thing called sound and separated the ground floor flats with plasterboard.

I'm saying an alternative view is that the newspaper is just selling to the biggest crowd. If it came out in support of the Tories in Scotland, it would sink like a rock. What would be the point? If it came out supporting Labour, it would sink like a slightly smaller and more porous rock. However, if it supports the SNP (who are the hot topic of the day), it is going to grab the attention of many potential readers (and probably their money as well). 

As for England, the conservative agenda is one that resonates with a lot of the electorate (30-33% Tory, 10-15% UKIP, 6-10% Lib Deb (half) in total is 43-53%)(30-33% Labour, 4-6% Greens, 6-10% Lib Dems (half) is in total 37-44%). 

Of course, the way the seats are set up, that 15% UKIP is going to translate into 0.5-1% of the seats while that 6-10% Lib Dem is going to translate into a more favourable number (around 30% of the seats).

&gt; please tell me how Brown could possibly have known that the price was about to go up?

He decided to sell the gold at the low point in the price cycle -the lowest point in 20 years. This is not very complicated.

Honour? Please. In a single stroke he lost 10% of the value of Britain's reserve gold he wanted to sell. A countries finance has nothing to do with 'honour'.

&gt;the best economists in the country were telling him to do that 

Please link to one of them, because every economist I knew at the time said it was bonkers.

I converted to monthly interest, and also monthly TER+service charge, then blasted that all into excel (paying in 250 a month).

Originally the aristocracy and the business owners had competing interests. 

It was in the interests of the aristocracy to be socially conservative, uphold the rights of landowners, limit the franchise, and be protectionist.  Their interests were upheld by the Conservative party. 

The business owners wanted free trade and open markets, and wanted to extend the franchise to so that they weren't excluded from power. They came to be represented by the Liberal party. 

But in the end the aristocracy and the business owners intermarried and merged, and were represented by a Conservative party which absorbed the Liberals. This party was socially conservative and supported free trade and open markets. It stayed that way until Thatcher became PM.

Except that there is a problem with people being able to put food on the table for long extended periods of time. You can't make that conclusion from the usage of food banks.


Food banks are a response for emergency food need and food poverty exists out with emergency situations.  The most accurate picture you can get of the current state of food poverty in Britain can be gained from reading the [All Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Hunger and Food Poverty](https://foodpovertyinquiry.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/food-poverty-feeding-britain-final.pdf) published on December 8th.

null,false,The_Backseatsman,lfc12,,null,"Let's assume we're having a huge striking clear out, with 2 of Borini/Lambert/Balotelli going (maybe all 3). For the sake of shirt sales, let's say they keep Balotelli.

That leaves our striking options as Balotelli, Sturridge and Origi. Origi is only 20, and if we do get a top class striker could go out on loan again (depending how much play time he is getting, this may happen in Jan).

In midfield, if you include Sterling and Can we have. Sterling, Can, Markovic, Ibe, Henderson, Allen, Lucas, Coutinho, Lallana and possibly Rossiter. Out of those I could possible see Markovic going on loan, but all depends what BR/whoever is managing us next season's plans are. Although it may be unlikely, let's say for the sake of argument we get rid of 1 of Lucas/Allen. 

So our squad next season could look like this :

Sturridge, *New Striker*, Balotelli, Origi (possibly out on loan)

Sterling, *Depay*, Coutinho, Can (can be deployed in defence), Markovic, Ibe, Henderson, Lucas/Allen, Lallana, Rossiter

Let's say that Origi, Balotelli, Lucas/Allen, Markovic, Ibe and Rossiter are all fringe/depth/not yet ready players.

That leaves our main midfield and striking options as : Sturridge, *New Striker*, Sterling, *Depay*, Coutinho, Lallana, Henderson, Can

That's 8 main players who would realistically feature in most of the games next season. Let's compare that to Chelsea (simply because they've recently been crowned champions).

Really, their only striker who is 100% in the squad is Costa, with Remy + Drogba being fringe players. They'll probably sign someone next season with PL experience and can get the goals when Costa is injured or needs a break. This was supposed to be Remy, but he is just as injury prone. So let's say their 2 main strikers are Costa and *New Striker*.

Their midfield has : Hazard, Fabregas, Oscar, Matic, Willian and Cuadrado/Ramires

That's 8 players. I know this has rambled on for a bit, but Chelsea have been able to manage with a similar number of players, giving all of them suitable game time, utilizing them and in the end getting the rewards.

While I think most fans didn't think we'd be pushing Europa this year, most of us were sane enough to realize we weren't relegation fodder either. Media made it seem like our team was gutted and our manager was a mindless novice. Hernandez, Flores, Pozuelo, Canas and Michu had become too toxic to keep and Vorm was just shit last year. The reality is that we still had an attacking line of Routledge, Jonjo and Dyer led by Bony and a passable midfield in Ki/Britton with Rangel/Ash/Amat/Taylor in the back. While this isnt a Europa squad, its isnt a Championship one either. Losing Davies hurt, but Taylor is more than capable at the same position.

&gt; What did you realistically think Monk could achieve with his first full season in charge of Swansea?

I was looking for 10th. We added Gomis, Gylfi, Fabianski and Montero fairly quickly and any concerns about Monk's reputation inhibiting signings was quickly dispatched. All four players were obviously talented and it was evident that we'd have at least a passable squad going forward.

Then the season started. While Fab, Gylfi and Montero were expected to be good, they surpassed most everyone's expectations. Gylfi is a top 3 playmaker in the Premier League, Montero abused PL flanks with reckless abandon and Fabianski has arguably been the best signing of them all. While Gomis was still dodgy, Bony was prolific enough that we quickly realized the team we had could do some damage.

To sort of sum it up, Swansea have obviously surpassed expectations. While Monk plays a massive role in that, our players have surprised us with their performances as well. Ki went from a fringe player to arguably our player of the season, Jonjo has developed into one of the more prolific midfielders in the league and all our signings not named Gomis blew past expectations.

Funny enough if you check forums online there are fairly passionate groups that want Monk out and feel he's actually kept us from doing better. I think they are clinically insane, but it goes to show there is a strong dichotomy of opinion regarding Monk. My concerns lie in the future and seeing if we can continue this success, but Monk and Jenkins have made us all optimistic.",null,0,null,1430756455,null,0,false,0,cqy2obj,null,t3_34tkhj,null,t1_cqy2obj,null,t3_34tkhj,null,null,null,1432765435,null,11,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,11,null

Routledge was an experienced top division winger for years before signing for us, even if he was somewhat of a journeyman. He had just came to us off the back of a promotion winning loan spell at QPR and looked to be a decent signing on the free for a newly promoted EPL club.

Naughton is another signing that nobody said anything negative about at the time. Us and the Spurs fans were practically patting eachother on the back for another nice bit of business over in the [/r/soccer thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2tb2eg/official_kyle_naughton_to_swansea/).

Jack Cork was seen as a fantastic signing at the time, highly rated by everyone apart from you it seems. He was a very experienced midfielder which was exactly what we needed at the time. Southampton fans on their sub seemed [distraught at the loss and wanted to keep him](http://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsFC/comments/2u3sc6/swansea_city_agree_fee_for_southampton_midfielder/)

Shelvey was another known quantity and I think we all knew what we were getting into. He was never a finished product but the young 21 year old with all the potential to become something more like the player we have today. He was raw talent and potential and it paid off but he was the only risk of those you mentioned. [In the thread everyone was positive apart from the price tag.](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1hkizc/jonjo_shelvey_completes_swansea_move/)

I get that Saivet has potential, but there is no way he's going to turn into the next Thierry Henry at 24 with his poor goal record like the article suggests. He just happens to be part of that generation where lots of young strikers were being compared to Henry, just a simple google search provided me with [Luc Castaignos](http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3276/serie-a/2011/07/10/2568759/i-am-not-the-new-thierry-henry-inters-luc-castaignos), [Anthony Martial](http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2013/05/08/the-incredible-next-thierry-henry-arsenal-need-to-sign/), [Gervinho, Remy and Joel Cambell](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/982098-10-players-who-can-be-the-next-thierry-henry) to name just a few with the title.

Well, you'll be missing out. And they are the same show, not different versions of each other. But anyhoo...

&gt;Are the important to the story?

No, not really. They crossover a couple of times, and it will 'feel nicer' to seem them if you have watched the spin-offs but over all you won't *really* miss much.


&gt;Are they worth watching?

Yes. Oh my, yes.

Torchwood is amazing, for the most part. Following Captain Jack Harkness and his team in Cardiff, they defend the Earth from alien threats. Yes, Cardiff. The show is really quite good and only really let down by the first couple of episodes and the last series, but even then they are still excellent, and worth watching. It is more adult orientated, in the sex, drugs and Rock 'n' Roll way. 
I will say this: I've seen, read and listened to a lot of the Doctor Who universe and few things beat Torchwood: Children of Earth. It is amazing. 
And Torchwood is coming back, thanks to Big Finish, in the form of Audio Dramas, much to my delight. 
If you are interested, start watching Torchwood series 1 alongside series 3 of Doctor Who. Finish Torchwood series 1 before getting to the last three episodes of Doctor Who series 3. Watch TW series 2 alongside series 4 of DW, finish it before the last 2 episodes of DW series 4. Watch series 3, called Children of Earth, of TW alongside the 10th Doctor Specials, finish CoE before the last 2 specials (The End of Time parts 1 &amp; 2. Some people miss these, because of Netflix or summin'. This isn't series 5). And, finally, watch series 4 of TW alongside series 6 of DW. 
Hopefully you enjoy it, and remember: the 21st century is when it all changes.


The Sarah Jane Adventures follows the, well, adventures of Sarah Jane Smith, a former companion of the 3rd and 4th Doctors, a group of kids that live on her street (well, Clyde doesn't), her robotic dog K9 (another former companion. See, look at all the stuff you are missing out), and a super computer called Mr. Smith that lives in her attic. It is more aimed towards children/young-teens so aren't as dark (but I would argue they aren't all that light either) as Doctor Who but are still worth watching. 
Unfortunately, Elizabeth Sladen, who played Sarah Jane, passed away during filming of series 5 and no more episodes are being made, understandably so.
If you are interested, start series 1 of SJA alongside series 3 of DW. Watch the last two episodes of series 2 of SJA **after** the last 2 of series 4 of DW. Series 3 of SJA can be watched during the 10th Doctor specials, and finish it before the last 2 specials (The End of Time parts 1 and 2). Watch series 4 of SJA during series 5 of DW, watch episodes 5 &amp; 6 of SJA before the Christmas special of series 5. The rest of series 4 and 5 of SJA can be watched during series 6 of DW.
You'll enjoy them if you watch them. There's a whole universe of adventure right there on the doorstep.

Firstly, Labour basically took Scotland for granted for ages. Labour are also generally unpopular over the whole UK, and the backlash has been particularly strong in Scotland.

Basically, the reason this election looks like it could actually be quite interesting is because the parties are all doing a pretty terrible job at convincing anyone to vote for them, and those on the fringes of the Conservatives/Labour are starting to look elsewhere.

Labour are probably (finally) in the ascendance, but go back two months and a lot of people couldn't pick Ed Miliband out of a lineup. He had pretty much completely failed to make any kind of impact as leader of the opposition. But, at the same time, they've now been rattled by the bottom completely falling out in Scotland, with SNP dominating- compare [the 2010 elections](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/2010UKElectionMap.svg/2000px-2010UKElectionMap.svg.png) and the [predictions for 2015](http://www.electionforecast.co.uk/graphics/2015_predicted_winner.svg). Nicola Sturgeon is this year's debates star.

Cameron's stint as PM has seen him losing support with more die-hard Conservatives, hence the defections to UKIP. Likewise, Cameron was a newish face at the last election, compared with Gordon Brown, who a lot of people didn't want as PM. So the Conservatives were on the up, hence the coalition.

The Lib Dems became the kingmaker at the last election based on Clegg debating well and pretty much one key pledge, on tuition fees, that they then couldn't actually deliver. So everyone's deserted them, and they're gonna get wiped out.

UKIP saw a surge of prominence and voters at the European elections, but as time has gone on, there's a sense that's starting to fade. It's pretty much a cult of personality acting as an umbrella for all kinds of ""fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists"", as David Cameron put it.

The Greens are still a non-issue, despite actually managing to wheedle into one of the debates.

We got lucky with Suarez and Coutinho, but how many good players with potential have we bought? Those are the only players I can think of since the 08/09 title challenge season that we've brought in who have actually become world class players (Coutinho is debatable I know). It's crazy to me how many players we buy who are just average, or are young with high potential. If we actually went out and bought a world class striker and midfielder for this season we would have made top 4 no doubt. Instead we spent nearly all of the Suarez money on 20 year old players who may one day be really good. And sure I hope they do come good, but this summer (and even last summer) I would have been happy with spending all our money on 2 players who will immediately take us to the next level instead of 5-6 who are just average now and may be good in the future.


So all in all, you get better by buying players who are currently better than you already have. And if you want to make top 4 consistently, then look at the squads who consistently make top 4. They have world class players. We haven't for awhile which shouldn't surprise anyone why we haven't made top 4. Last year we had two world class strikers, so low and behold we got in the top 4.

also grogle, i am on the same train of thought with you...but what makes you so sure that next year will require one of the largest totals ever to reach top 4? i beg to differ. i actually believe that because of tv rights money coming in and FFP, the EPL will actually maintain this level of competitiveness for good. think about how much better teams like stoke, southampton, spurs, west ham, palace can all get with more money and effectively taking players away from the ""big 4""? the big 4 can't stockpile players any more so other teams can't get them.

we have built sustainably and prepared well for the future by not only acquiring some of the best foreign youth talent, but also have stockpiled british youth talent. we have a squad with an average age (if current players out of contract + enrique + lambo all leave) of 22.88.  we have a stadium being finished by the start of not the next season, but the following season. we have a 50m kit sponsor, 30m shirt sponsor plus probably close to 50m from garuda indonesia, dunkin, subway, vauxhall and more. 

we are well positioned to spend big, we are well positioned to challenge big and i think next year we have a genuine chance at top 4, if not higher up the table. you must think, we played piss poor the first 3 months and were in 13th place at one point and all without a recognized striker. we went on a 13 match unbeaten run and have lost 3 of our last 6, while only drawing once and winning twice in that same stretch also without a recognized striker for the most part. but yet we are still in the running for 4th. it is painfully obvious to me that this is a team with a huge upside, and the ability to play up to the highest level in the premiership, our unbeaten run proves that and that was all without our best player, sturridge. and yes sturridge is absolutely our best player when healthy and firing. what he did last year was nothing short of amazing. 

i think if we get a striker + a goalscoring winger/midfielder/adaptable striker (depay) + milner + a rb, we will be challenging from the get go. BR is putting his foot on the gas, and hopefully with a striker who is more reliable than sturridge, (ideally) a depay and sterling buzzing around for coutinho to play through balls to, we will be singing a hugely different tune.

Do not try to filter if you're not comfortable on your bike yet. It'll come with time and practice. 


Find out when maintenance for your bike is due and which things you can do yourself rather than pay for a mechanic to do them for you - i.e. oil and oil filter changes etc. Unless youre buying new this is well worth it. 


Buy a cover - your bike not being noticed in the first place is worth more than a hundred chains/locks


Buy a chain brush and invest in chain cleaner. Saved me loads of hassle.


Buy a tyre repair kit (not a can that fills the tyre with foam) and put it under the seat. 


Get a Sena SMH10 and link it with your phone for all your GPS needs. Cheap and cheerful, and if you make other riding buddies you may well be able to talk to them over it if they have one too :)

We lose him from our squad plus Sturridge and our attack is shattered. We have no striker who seems capable of putting the ball in the net. Rodgers managed to find a system to stop leaking goals so we can gain more points from less goals scored. So I would say he can adapt.

The same way that Thatcher managed to convince everyone that ownership was the key to success, the Conservatives have managed to get us to believe it's all Labour's fault.

More importantly though is the closeness of the result. Polls can be wrong of course, but they'd have to be very wrong if we're going to have anything other than a close election and several days if not weeks of political wrangling.

null,false,Ewannnn,null,null,null,"Just a note but the Tories haven't increased spending in real terms. They've actually cut government spending every year they were in power as a % of GDP meanwhile revenues have been increasing. As an example for 2010/11/12/13 the figures were 44.86/44.03/42.70/40.52 while revenue figures were 35%/36/36/37. The real reason the government were in such trouble in 2010 onwards is government revenue was terrible &amp; couldn't keep up with costs. Welfare spending &amp; pension costs have increased rapidly because many people lost their jobs (for instance Welfare spending in 2008 was less than in 2013 despite all the Tory cuts). Government revenue fell through the roof because businesses closed, people lost their jobs etc, from 40% in 2009 to 35% in 2010. When spending goes up from 40 to 45% in one year and revenue goes down from 40-35% at the same time you're left with a huge deficit. 

The issue people have with the Tories is they want to do everything by cutting the state budget rather than trying to increase tax revenues by not cutting so many jobs / raising taxes. The fact they had a tax cut on the richest at such a time is completely ridiculous. I also have issue with the whole idea that taxes should be low, if you look at the northern European countries, Norway/Denmark/Sweden they all have very high levels of tax but also very high levels of equality. This doesn't just mean everyone is worse off either, these are countries that are more wealthy than we are on a per capita basis. This is why I always laugh when people look at the Greens as unrealistic, there are plenty of countries that have tax systems similar to what they're suggesting. We all like to look up to the Nordic countries as sort of a bastion of idealism yet we don't want to fund it via taxes. It's like we want their welfare state &amp; American taxes but this is a completely paradoxical idea - the money has to come from somewhere. Just as an overview of how different our taxes are: in Denmark their tax revenue as a % of GDP is 49% while ours is 33%.",null,0,null,1430763266,null,0,1430764184,0,cqy6vi9,null,t3_34t8hw,null,t1_cqy6vi9,null,t1_cqy3p9k,null,null,null,1432767414,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

For centuries the Marches on either side of the boundary was an area of mixed allegiances, **where families or clans switched which country or side they supported as suited their family interests at that time**, and lawlessness abounded. Before the personal union of the two kingdoms under James, **the border clans would switch allegiance between the Scottish and English crowns depending on what was most favourable for the members of the clan**. For a time a powerful local clan dominated a region on the border between England and Scotland. It was known as the Debatable Lands and neither monarch's writ was heeded.""

I trust Henderson, Can, Lucas, and even Gerrard in that position over Allen. attacking midfielders and wingers? he's my fifth choice over Lallana, sterling, Marko, and Ibe.  

Allen has a motor, and his strength is running down his mistakes or chasing people back. We've all seen him run back and make a crucial tackle that saves a breakaway, but how often was that because of a faulty pass or being out of position? He's a squad player but he gets more playing time than he should because he's BR's purchase. Would Allen play for any other top 5 team? Spurs and Southampton, sure.

Is it such a crime to choose a team that you enjoy watching and that does well? Too bad OP endured such bs with that linked post. This place is a bit bi-polar. 

Loyalty is the big factor in a true fan. As an American fan, I've followed this team from afar for many years (started watching them circa 2004-2005), and it's not so easy to understand the culture that's in London. But just bc I wasn't even into the SPORT at all pre-Roman doesn't make me plastic. I've worn my jerseys on both good days and bad. and I've taken hella shit for it too, at times. The culture is different here in the States, bc very few in this country have an ACTUAL reason for following our club. And anyway, it's no longer a sport that is ""your dad's club that you inherit."" It's not just an English game.  It's a global game. And while I understand the mentality of earning one's way in by suffering together, I just hate that we turn fans away by being cunts to newbies bc some of us feel some sort of hipster entitlement. Honestly, the only thing that I get frustrated with is the ""exclusive club"" or ""you don't belong"" attitude that sometimes shows up here from these keyboard hooligans, most of whom couldn't tell you the year the club was born. Is it at all possible that we could just appreciate that we're attracting fans because we're playing good football? That's something to be proud of imo. But it's gross to see fair-weather fans in any sport. but all clubs have those, and there's nothing anyone can do about that.

We're not talking about some missed passes that caused a change in possession we're talking about gifting away goals in a relegation fight.

To draw from baseball a little bit... It's not like some baserunning error, it's more like you lost the game because your third baseman threw the ball into the stands in the 9th inning with a man on second after getting the second out of the inning. It's a concentration issue with both the scenario and with Guzan. You watch him and you know he's more than capable but he's not playing to his potential because his concentration has been lacking. Let him sit and let him find it... He'll be better for it.

EDIT: 
&gt;I don't see how that's a positive message to give a team whose poor performances previously have almost unanimously been attributed to ""playing with fear"" personally, but okay.

I think we're discussing two different things here... Players have to be able to go onto the pitch and play freely... Which means they have to be willing to make mistakes on the pitch to make the plays. To draw again from baseball: diving for the ball, aggressive baserunning, (etc.) all of which can backfire in your face. However, they also have to avoid the silly mistakes. There is a difference between making mistakes on the pitch and doing things that make everyone ask what the fuck you were thinking...

DOUBLE EDIT: 

If you don't watch baseball I seen you post in /r/Bengals so maybe American Football is more up your alley? Which case I'd say the story is pretty much the same.

As for our midfield, Milner is looking likey, and either him or someone similar would surely be enough to fix the hole left by Gerrard's departure. I expect Henderson to take on even more responsibility as a leader, and having the extra body and experience of an industrious midfielder like Milner will surely shore up our midfield worries. Our defense, honestly, is good enough. All I would look for is another fullback and hopefully the retention of Manquillo. Maybe Rodgers is letting him sit the bench so that Madrid will want him less and Glen Johnson will hopefully go for a higher fee.

IMO this is the biggest mistake Clegg's made in the last 5 years - given that going into government burned a lot of bridges with the typical student Lib Dem protest voter demographic, there should have been a bigger attempt to forge a more distinct identity. The Lib Dem campaign has been pretty awful (as have all the other party's) and overall very negative.

null,false,warmans,null,null,null,"I have a slightly unusual approach to cover letters but it seems to work so I maybe it's worth recommending.

Firstly nobody is fooled by bullshit. If you're writing about how you synergised the problem domain business outcomes to foster revenue-based growth opportunities you are wasting people's time with meaningless bullshit and they will not appreciate it. Keep the information simple and to the point. What have you actually done in your career that was worth a crap to anyone? Talk about that instead.

Don't just replicate your CV in long form. If you have qualifications that can be listed as bullet points on your CV then just direct the readers attention to these where relevant. Don't write long drawn-out descriptions of your great pleasure in obtaining your widget manufacturing guild's intermediate forklift driver's certification. The cover letter and CV are compliments to one another, they should avoid duplication.

In general I think it is worth maintaining a certain mindset - specifically that you are confident in your ability to do the job and the cover letter is only a formality. You should be able to honestly, succinctly and accurately describe what qualifies you for the job and why you're applying for it in the first place. Good people aren't desperate for jobs and coming across as desperate is a good way to make it look like you're not good people.

Finally I don't think anyone ever got hired off the back of an unbelievable cover letter. It's just a way to help an employer gauge if you're remotely suitable for the position. You don't need to blow their nips off with a great piece of literature, you just need to make them think you can actually do the job well enough to arrange an interview. If you only need 2-3 paragraphs to make that impression then keep it short. If you need more then use more. If you start trying to inflate the size of the document arbitrarily it will just water down the good stuff. People have a limited capacity to absorb information. Give the reader the best chance of absorbing the stuff you care about.

Take this advice with a gain of salt. I'm sure there are some industries that can't get enough bullshit in their lives but this approach has worked for me.",null,0,null,1430766064,null,0,false,0,cqy8m4b,null,t3_34qozw,null,t1_cqy8m4b,null,t3_34qozw,null,null,null,1432768245,null,1,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,1,null

As said elsewhere, the majority of them are full cast audio dramas, pretty comparable to a TV Doctor Who story but generally with a slightly smaller cast and a few concessions made for the medium, with characters describing what they're seeing a bit more than usual.  There are other lines such as the companion chronicles that are more similar to an audiobook, generally presented as one character recounting the tale to another.  All the main range stuff, plus the Fourth Doctor Adventures and Eighth Doctor Adventures are the former type, the full cast productions.  The Torchwood and UNIT stuff will be as well.

A rumour is that this was a deliberate ploy to bail out an American Investment Bank who had been caught short while trying to manipulate the market... which raises questions about the credibility, authenticity, judgement and ultimately priorities of all three...

On the flip side, they could be three arrogant idiots who didn't realise that holding huge amounts of a asset, trading at record low prices is essentially a risk free trade served up to them on a silver platter.

Congratulations on the weight loss! IMO start by reviewing your diet, five a day is the bare minimum (guideline is 'at least') but many countries now advocate **seven to nine** in the full rainbow of bright and dark colours (most think greens but forget blue/ purple). These supply **antioxidants** that are critical in anti-ageing and general health.

Whilst dieting don't lose sight of a your intake of **essential fatty acids** particularly oily fish (experts advocate up to four servings a week), whole eggs, seeds such as pumpkin and chia, walnuts. These are incorporated into every cell in the body, including skin, and support it holding onto water.

Micronutrients work synergistically and in opposition, it is not a great idea to randomly supplement them individually or in small groups. Many supplements are low in magnesium for example, which is needed in the correct balance with vitamin D and calcium. **Mineral rich foods** include seeds, nuts, beans and lentils, and many are richer sources than the more widely eaten wholegrains.

In terms of cosmetic topicals firstly a **broad spectrum sunscreen,** which you will need to reapply later in the day and regularly for your hands as you wash them. See the sidebar for our article on sun protection based on the official recommendations (not just when it's sunny, UV can penetrate cloud and your car windows!). There is a sunscreen mega review linked to in the sidebar which includes lots of hand creams.

Secondly the 'holy trinity' of anti ageing actives: **a retinoid, vitamin C and niacinamide.** See our ingredients Wiki and the mega reviews linked to in the sidebar. I consistently apply my anti ageing actives to my neck, decollete and hands, and my hands have probably had the best results! I would note I do not use regular harsh hand wash/ shower gel/ body wash, because these just strip and dry the skin (and hair and nails).

Neither glycerin or lanolin are usually used alone for regular skin, they should be a minor ingredient (&lt;5%). It would be HIGHLY unusual for that level of glycerin to cause a breakout, it is not comedogenic nor irritant. You will also really struggle to find products without glycerin, because it is cheap and effective.",null,0,null,1430767420,null,0,1430767823,0,cqy9gsy,null,t3_34unl4,null,t1_cqy9gsy,null,t3_34unl4,null,null,null,1432769282,null,3,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,3,null

They argue that they ameliorated the cuts to welfare and focused tax reductions on lifting the tax free allowance as opposed to Tory aims of reducing inheritance tax and abolishing the 45% rate completely.  The only other outright block I recall was on parliamentary reform to bring MP numbers to 600.  This was predicted to benefit the Tories some 10-15 seats overall.

I don't think they did a great job of telling people the effect they had on Tory policies in government, perhaps thinking it was more important to negotiate behind the scenes, which makes it difficult to answer your question definitively.

Nearly all interaction with the public has been incredibly tightly stage-managed, the main parties have boxed themselves into a corner by pledging not to increase a lot of different taxes, and also pledging to maintain or increase public spending, and also reduce the deficit, which is clearly BS and whoever wins Labour or Conservative will have to put up taxes and implement some fairly unpalatable cuts. It's almost guaranteed the next 5 years will be pretty awful because of this, and in additon, we will either have a high chance of leaving the EU (Conservative coalition), or some kind of constitutional meltdown (Labour / SNP coalition) due to the West Lothian question.

I don't think Arsenal is going to be in the hunt next season, barring 3 or so major signings (Sanchez ish quality and price). I could see Utd getting better as LVG puts more of a stamp on his team (and spends another 100 million). City will need to revamp, at least partly, but should still be good.

But I think he lacks in too many areas to warrant a spot at a club with title aspirations. He's constantly physically overmatched because he's very small, very weak, and surprisingly slow considering his size. I understand the appeal of the scrappy underdog, and I really do love his heart and effort... But I'd rather the scrappy underdog played for the other team.

I love his ability to maintain possession with short, quick passing in the midfield. It's valuable for multiple reasons, and I think/hope that that's something that even his most ardent critics understand. But that short, quick passing is really the extent of his contribution. Like I said, it's a very valuable skill, but that isn't enough. There are a lot of players that are capable of doing the exact same thing, while also contributing to the game in other ways. For example, look at Henderson: He's capable of maintaining possession and changing the point of attack through quick, intelligent ball movement, but he's also capable of out-muscling the opposition, winning aerial battles, opening space through movement and ball movement in the final third, and chipping in with goals and assists. I'm not saying that every central midfielder needs to be like Henderson, but rather that every player in that position needs to be able to contribute in a multitude of ways. That's just something that Allen isn't capable of. 

I like the kid. He seems like a genuinely good guy, and it's impossible to dislike a player that leaves it all on the pitch the way he does... But I just don't think he's a good enough player to warrant a spot in a squad with the aspirations that we have.

SNP supporters are blind because all they see is a us vs them situation. Everytime you question the logic their story changes and everytime the media questions SNP you get a bunch of angry people on twitter claiming bias. I said to some SNP supporters that oil is important to Scotland but they disagreed and said it didn't matter at all. Even though without oil Scotland runs at a £9.1 billion per year higher deficit than the rest of the UK.

i hate comparing mou's situation (any of them) to our current one at lfc. the one at lfc is the same thing mourinho is doing, but our strategy is backed up by more stats. it's all gambles and what makes mourinho good, like being a good blackjack player, is that sometimes you get hot, make the right choice and win (sometimes the wrong choices too) and sometimes you can do a lot of things right, play by the book, and still lose.

Without oily fish it is impossible to get enough long chain omega-3s or bioavailable vitamin D, in the UK we cannot make enough vitamin D from sunlight October to March so deficiency is rife. Furthermore the conversion rate of short chain omega-3s (some seeds, walnuts but not other nuts) to long chain is as low as 10% so the amount you need to eat each day is MASSIVE. There is small amounts of long chain omega-3s in other seafood (molluscs are super nutritious but few eat them).

I ate a poorly balanced diet until I got sick enough not to be able to work, then I forced myself to 'woman up' and eat the foods our bodies evolved to need. I now love rainbow trout, can eat canned oily fish in various recipes, plus fresh fish in things like my father's fish pie. Trust me I was gagging the first time I opened a can of pink salmon, but I made a deal with myself to eat a single bite. You can do it too, if you set your mind to having healthier skin and a healthier body (which you clearly have!).

I also have sensitive skin (rosacea, history of eczema/ dermatitis) so my reviews may be helpful to you.

Premier League is completely different from Eredivisie. Even if you just watch some youtube videos about his goals (which is horrible way to assess a player, but can be useful in some cases) you'll see a pattern - tap-ins, free-kicks, counter-attacks where defenders are back-pedalling. I would be much more encouraged when we'd see him score more against deeper defence as in beats someone 1v1 and scores or makes run behind semi-deep defence and scores. And that's because these kind of goals convert better into EPL. There are instances of him doing it, but it's more of an exception.

In EPL the defences are tighter and those free flowing counters rarely happen unless the opponent is desperate. Counter attacking goals, long shots and free kicks are great bonus, but consistent source of goals to rely on, especially in EPL (for example, Everton have the highest amount of counter attacking goals according to Opta - only about 5, I think). 

You get why I'm a bit skeptical of his goals converting to EPL easily? I'm not saying that he won't adjust, just that the types of his goals scored for PSV aren't convincing me. If we are in position where we can get him - let's fucking go for it! But if I had to choose right now (and could only have one) - Depay or some 26-27 year old proven goalscorer (if those exist).

As for work during university, this is tricky as your student visa will not allow you to work as you will not have a national insurance number or the valid work visa. 

You will certainly live in a shared accommodation, potentially on campus in first year as is expected. Rent can vary a lot between university towns from £250-500 pcm.

In addition English language certificates will be mandatory to ensure your comprehension of the material is sufficient. 

Best of luck to you.

No you are completely misunderstanding what I was saying. OP tried to somehow portray himself as impartial when he clearly strongly dislikes the SNP.

null,false,Myoptical,null,null,null,"People seem to be mistaking that upgrading an entire governments worth of computer hardware and software is not too different from upgrading a personal computer, or a bunch of computers at a small firm.

Windows XP came out around 13 odd years ago and provided a relatively stable and decent framework for computing based tasks. As a result, millions of pounds were spent on building applications for very specific tasks that utilised these frameworks and systems. Even before that, you had unique and very specific software ported over from older systems. Now, since then companies have gone bust, software engineers retired or died, and the cost for new software shoot up. 

What was the replacement? Windows Vista. After basic research was done, very few departments would touch vista with a bargepole. No matter how keen Microsoft were on selling it. So a few years later Windows 7 pops out and then 8 and 8.1 shortly afterwards.

Why not a Linux based OS you may ask? It is difficult enough getting several thousand new users acquainted with new software from the same company, never mind a completely different style. Having users efficiency rapidly decreased, and mistakes increased is not something any government department wants. So fire all the lazy dumb buggers you may say! Well, believe it or not, the value of an employee is not only due to their computer skills. 

So back to upgrading. You have to move from XP to a new system, which one do you choose? Well, we've established that the majority are familiar with windows based systems, so we will stick with that family. Lets see, we can choose Windows 7, 8.1, or Windows 10. Now we have no idea about windows 10, and it will be released long after we need to switch. Windows 8.1 is nice, but it lacks the compatibility with our applications. So 7 is must be.

Applications you say? Why can't we buy new ones?...

First case, it's 1990 and you are tasked with getting a developer to build you an application that solves problem X. Developer for £££ solves problem x and provides support up until 2002. They sell you ProblemX-XP edition for £££££. Developer folds up and retires to Spain. This application works without fault for the next 10 years. However, due to the design, it will require a rewrite to work on windows 7. Compatibility mode isn't sufficient. You get a team to look at the application and conclude that no one knows what the fuck the original developer really did, and the documentation is a pile of misleading crap. It's written in a language that few today still use or know well enough to rewrite the application. That is the case if you have the rights to the code. Otherwise, you resort to asking a new company to build a new application and this will cost you more ££££.

Second case, it's 2002 and you are a lonesome worker in a department. You cobble together some scripts and code to produce a function that handles a difficult problem. This function is copied and pasted everywhere and used all over the place. It's now 2012 and the program no longer works on windows 7 because it uses active x. You try to find the original creator, but he has long disappeared along with the rest of the department when it was sold of to a friend of a politician several years ago for pocket change. He is unlikely to care or be willing to help, probably because he said ""this is a temporary fix, please develop something stable"".

In both cases, you have had applications working reliably for nearly a decade without complaint. Suddenly you need to update and half your software no longer works. On top of buying brand new hardware, and software, and new servers, and new server software, and new networking equipment, and security equipment, and back up equipment, effectively replacing the entire god damn computer infrastructure, you will have to pay and harass developers to replicate existing functionality. Never mind the cost of employing new experts and staff to manage all this new fangled crap.

All of this at the cost larger than your existing budget for the past 5 years. You can't avoid this cost, you can't not upgrade, but you can't afford it. Could you have planned around this? Maybe, but you would have needed a willingness to spend that sort of money earlier, when every new government has been slashing your budget in two.

null,false,grodecki,null,null,null,"Credit cards offer a number of benefits to those that use them wisely.

Firstly you get Section 75 protection; if a retailer online or the like does not send your goods or something happens, you will be able to get a refund directly from the credit card issuer as opposed to dealing with the company. This is particularly good in cases where companies have gone bust as there is normally no way for someone who has paid with a debit card to get their money back.

Secondarily they allow you to maximise the amount of time you hold your cash in savings. I can spend all of my outgoings for am onth on my card, and keep the cash that would have otherwise have been spent accumulating interest. This is a minimal benefit unless you are using advanced techniques such as stoozing to benefit from long term zero percent deals.

The other thing they are good for is building a credit rating, use and pay it off and it will give you a good credit profile which will help if you get around to getting a mortgage.

I'd reccomend either talking to your bank in order to get one, or getting a credit builder card. The first card I had was a Barclaycard Initial which I still have, I initially had a limit of about 800 but it's gone up over the years and is now about £3600.

I also have a card from AmEx which gives me cashback on every transaction, which is nice, but you likely won't get that with no real history.

&gt;Plenty of people in this sub can be particularly vile to SNP supporters

Load of tripe honestly, SNP voters will regularly get their voices and concerns heard and upvoted in this sub. Anyone who even dares suggest union could be a good thing will be downvoted and insulted non-stop in a place like /r/Scotland. You will even jump together in this sub and downvote anyone who disagrees with you.

This has been brought up **multiple times** there at how /r/scotland is an incredibly hostile and vile environment for discussion unless all you want to do is talk about how you hate people who live in the UK or no voters.


http://en.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1ep8g9/where_are_all_the_unionists_why_is_there_no_debate/

http://en.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/2fpq24/so_is_this_subreddit_just_yes_scotland_voters/

Face it, nationalists and SNP supporters are incredibly hostile to anyone who disagrees with them and will do anything to shut them down. /r/scotland is a prime example of that, even the mods join in and encourage it. You make Scottish people feel unwelcome in their own subreddit or homes because you non-stop criticism them and shout them down at every turn you get. 

You only want open discussion for yourselves, anytime someone anti-nationalist comes up you spit all over them just like you're trying to do to this guy because he posted something anti-SNP.

You're even downvoting him just for saying he doesn't support SNP. You're worse than the /pol/ brigaders for targeting and downvoting anyone you don't like.

**Look at this:**

A normal fucking discussion and you nationalists just go and downvote him to minuses just because he disagreed with the SNP line, he wasn't insulting anyone or saying anything nasty. Just saying that Scottish tax powers haven't been used so he thinks more isn't a big deal, and you go and downvote him for it.

No. You regularly mix up opinion &amp; fact in an attempt at getting your opinion passed as fact. ""They should have opened a second front much sooner"" is your opinion. The previous lines are fact, but you leave out the context that makes those factual events astute Allied decision making.

For example, attacking the Nazis at points that stretch their supply line is common sense, so too is protecting their own strategic oil supply lines. The Western Allies approach was systematic and yes maybe opportunistic, but the opposite of that would have been another Dunkirk. There will always be dissenting voices along the way, concentrating on minor points, but at this stage the accepted narrative of WWII is not a controversial one.

He's currently claiming that Jim Murphy's supporters assaulted him today and, according to a Glasgow SNP councillor, he's also [disrupted Sturgeon's surgery](https://twitter.com/MhairiHunter/status/595251933386035201) three times and claimed that she assaulted him too.

I don't believe he's ever been arrested yet, however apparently he already had a meeting scheduled with the police tomorrow to [discuss his 'protests'](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/police-ask-campaigner-to-tell-them-anti-murphy-protest-plans-in-advance.123570026).

I've no doubt that Jim Murphy is well aware of who he is (he was also at the anti-Miliband protest in Tollcross last Friday), [as do his staff](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/ugly-scenes-as-hardline-nationalists-disrupt-labour-event-in-glasgow.125052594):

&gt;[Clerkin] insisted he was not acting on political instruction, saying he had left the SNP eight years ago in a protest over its housing policy.
&gt;
&gt;The serial campaigner also claimed he had been tipped off about the event by disaffected members of the Labour Party within Mr Murphy's East Renfrewshire heartland.
&gt;
&gt;He said: ""Of course (his protest) is a good thing. This isn't just me. There were 25 other working-class people there, people who are saying Labour has become the red Tories and we're there to demonstrate against £30billion in cuts.
&gt;
&gt;""This will be portrayed as something else by the establishment but its just old-fashioned political heckling, a democratic tradition. But I am being called obsessive and delusional.""
&gt;
&gt;He added: ""I was told by members of the Labour Party in East Renfrewshire at 8.30 am this morning. I had time to ring around people. I believe the intentions of those who told me was honourable. They have told me plenty in the past.""

Not at all, I especially don't think you can have had your eyes open during the independence referendum, pro-independence views were thoroughly attacked, I don't think my inbox has ever been so red as it was then.


&gt;This has been brought up multiple times there at how /r/scotland is an incredibly hostile and vile environment for discussion unless all you want to do is talk about how you hate people who live in the UK or no voters.


You're the only one bringing /r/Scotland up, I've never mentioned it once or responded to anything you've said about it once. It just sounds like this is your narrative and you're sticking to it, regardless of what I actually talk about.



&gt;Face it, nationalists and SNP supporters are incredibly hostile to anyone who disagrees with them and will do anything to shut them down.


Again sweeping generalisations, I thought everyone knew by now not to paint everyone with the same brush?



&gt;You make Scottish people feel unwelcome in their own subreddit or homes because you non-stop criticism them and shout them down at every turn you get.


I assume you're not talking to me but the big /r/Scotland championing extreme violent nationalist straw man you've been building up.



&gt;You're even downvoting him just for saying he doesn't support SNP. You're worse than the /pol/ brigaders for targeting and downvoting anyone you don't like.


I haven't down voted anyone. And I am fine with people not liking the SNP, I responded to OP because of his particularly patronising and in my view incorrect analysis of the situation.

We understand that customers are keen to upgrade to IE9, and we plan to support this browser before the end of 2015, but we are unable to commit as to a date for support.""

The other bid came from a tiny company with a handful of installations in the UK. They said ""We use standardised HTML5 and javascript technologies. We expect any modern browser platform to work correctly. As standard we offer support for IE8-10, Safari, Chrome and Firefox on Windows XP-8, Mac OS X 10.4 and later, and iOS 5 and later.

How, exactly? Licensing? No. Cross-training? No. Cross-apps? No. Streaming apps, then? No (at least, not until you've paid someone to port them all). New users? More cost to both. 3rd party apps? More $ to port or develop. Lots and lots of councils (and governments) have already looked into it - Munich fudging the numbers for a ten year migration isn't enough. For example;

&gt;any initial training needed would be recouped

Really? All your trained staff will remain onsite *forever*? Or are you suggesting that all new staff will already know Open Office and Linux?

Shall we move onto the cost of *just* running OfficeConverter (another 3rd party app) against all the documentation saved for your *entire estate* to highlight where OpenOffice won't covert properly?

Even scoring from Tap-ins and Counter attacks is not a problem. It's getting in the right position, making the right decision, shooting well with good placement and scoring. 

1v1 is Rodgers' forte. He sees the game in that way. Everything is 1v1 for Rodgers. Can Depay beat a man? Yes. Is he strong and fast? Yes. Is he comfortable playing with the ball, providing width, making/getting on through passes? Yes. So what if he scores from free kicks? We had Suarez scoring bucket loads last season from free kicks, it's a positive thing if a source of his goals come from them, especially with Gerrard gone and Balotelli likely as well. Set plays are extremely important in the modern game and he's a good striker from set pieces. 

I'm not sure what you mean when you talk about counter-attacks. Just because he's scored goals in a team that counter-attacks doesn't mean he can't score goals in a team that doesn't. The types of Goals are almost entirely irrelevant. The only thing that you should look at when looking at Goals is how much they get from the spot and how much that inflates their stats (Which is probably why we bought Balotelli, his open play goals are not great but overall it looks like he scores goals). And Depay's goal scoring records aren't inflated by penalties at all. What's most important is the Open Play goals. And he does very well in that category. 

I think you're more towards questioning if he fits into Rodgers' system, and having seen him play I would say absolutely. He's not like an Andy Carroll, who needs crosses in the box. He's quick, strong and scores goals with his feet rather than his head. That's Rodgers' attacking philosophy in a nutshell.

null,false,Eddie_Hitler,null,null,null,"Yes, in many cases that's absolutely true.  

Let's assume you went for the Suffolk option and commute from Ipswich each day:

* 12 Month season ticket: £7092.00.  That works out at £591pcm, £89.90 cheaper than a One Month ticket.  This includes a Zone 1-6 Travelcard which probably won't get used as any London-bound commuter will be working in Zone 1 - waste of money

* Travel to and from the station.  How, and from where?  How long is that journey?  If you drive then there's fuel, wear and tear, and parking charges (Ipswich Station it seems to be around £1600 a year).  Include the *time and effort* this takes as a ""hidden cost""

* Other ""hidden costs"" - Packed trains.  Unreliable line from Norwich&lt;-&gt;Liverpool Street.  Long journey times as the non-stop morning service from Ipswich takes just over an hour, more regular stopping services can take between 1hr10-20 mins (even David Cameron has said he wants to see this reduced).  Once in London, where is your office?  How do you get there, and how long does it take?  What time do you need to be in?  What time do you knock off and when will you get home?  There's a real possibility of a four hour round-trip living as far out as Suffolk.

So, season ticket + parking (assuming you need it) is nearly £9000 a year, or £750 a month.  That's *before* your other household bills such as rent/mortgage, council tax, utilities... nightmare.

I really can't decide whether or not that's worth it from a quality of life point of view, would it not be better to just live in London?  Thoughts?  The real benefit is being able to get on the property ladder more easily and more quickly, although your place in Ipswich won't be worth a huge amount.

That £750 could rent you a room in a shared place granting you somewhat of a social life, reduce your bills as some rooms are all inclusive or you'd be splitting with house mates anyway, and lay waste to your commute.  It could also go towards a deposit or mortgage on somewhere closer or within London.  Or you could rent an even cheaper room and save the extra cash even after buying a travel card - somewhere half respectable like Charlton is much cheaper than Zone 2 yuppieville and you can be at Cannon Street in 15 minutes.

Although I never worked full time in London, I did live and work in Ipswich with occasional work trips to London and have experienced the travelling myself.  Some people do this *every day* and come from as far afield as Norwich!  Once the rail links are upgraded Ipswich will get very expensive anyway, as it's now full of yuppie flats and has a cheaper cost of living than Colchester just down the road.

This means that when I go to vote, I'll get two ballot papers.

One will have the candidates standing for parliament to represent this constituency, the other will have those standing for election to the council to represent my local ward. Bear in mind that with our electoral system, we vote for a candidate who represents a political party (or an independent candidate), rather than directly voting for a party.

Only some councils, or indeed some seats on some councils, are up for election at one time, unlike a general election where all seats are voted on at the same time. If your poll card only lists the parliamentary election, your particular local area has no local election taking place, but there could be ones taking place in adjacent wards. (Local councils can also have by-elections, so if a councillor died in the last few months, the election of a replacement will be taking place on Thursday but only for the few thousand voters in that ward.)

It also can be the case that not all major parties have candidates in one or the other of the elections: I've been canvassing, and when we meet people who intend to vote UKIP, we've been explaining to them that there's no UKIP candidate standing in the council election and highlighting the ability to vote differently depending on local and national priorities.

null,false,colondee,null,null,null,"All Australian P1s and P2s will be converted to full UK (actually GB, as NI has a different licensing scheme) on application to the DVLA. To convert, you need to bring and send proof that you passed the tests in Australia.

When you apply to convert, you need to declare the date you started to live in the UK. However, as you have a UK passport, there will be no stamps when you enter the UK, therefore they have no way of knowing whether you are actually resident in the UK. The DVLA doesn't check information with the Border Force as their IT systems are screwed up. For people with a visa they can check the physical visa (soon to be issued as ID cards for foreigners) and stamps. (The DVLA can obtain your UK passport photo to use on your licence, though.)

The Australian licence will be sent back to Australia, which means you'll have to pay again to get it back. And then you'll still have to pass all the tests to get a full Australian licence, as they won't convert your UK one back.

This is why I did my test in Hong Kong, converted HK provisonal to GB full, waited 3 years and then converted GB to NSW full. (NSW also accepts conversions from HK if you're over 25, which I wasn't, but they accepted the UK one despite having obtained it from HK anyway...)

If you want to do the test in the UK then you'll have to apply for a UK provisional here.


I don't think you'll be able to rent. UK rental agencies are unlikely to accept Australian provisionals, but if you do convert them, they won't be 12 months old and thus not accepted either.
