Firmino is a clear talent with 140 appearances in the Bundesliga.

Plus I thought they'd be the party most likely to boost the housing market to get young aspirational people on the ladder. Whereas I felt labour would resort to their natural comfort zone which is over-regulation and state subsidy, in this case of the rental market.

I can't tell you how painful it is to watch 40% of your income vanish in income tax alone (before the 12% national insurance, 9% over £15K student loan, 7% salary sacrifice pension etc.) kicks in. It means for every £1 I earn, I get to keep about 40p of it..

Then I see the queue coming out the job centre and it makes my heart sink. People smoking marijuana openly, talking about gaming the system and how they can't be fucked with work. Or how about the discussion on this very reddit the other day where a fair few members enthusiastically told another member how to fake 35hours a week of job hunting in order to ""game"" the system...

I'm all for supporting those that need it, and for not vilifying them either... but the system has been wide open to abuse for the better part of the last 25 years and it really shows. Council estates for full of these dynastic families of benefits scroungers and it has to end. I'll vote tory again if they continue with this current purge. We need to use the money we have more effectively, and I'd like to see the genuinely and seriously disabled (i.e. people that have lost limbs, registered blind etc.) see a far larger share of the pie. I don't want to see able-bodied people with soft-illnesses like depression (because their lives are genuinely fucking depressing) have access to the same funding. They certainly deserve soem support... but not to the extent they currently have it.

I appreciate the above will make for hard reading to some users, especially on the touchy subject of depression... but it's how I feel, and I think how a lot of people in work feel. Sometimes I get the impression many people on benefits have very little insight into just how hard a person has to work to earn £30-40k... and by extension how they must feel to see thousands of pounds that they earned siphoned off to pay for the lazy and feckless. **I want to feel proud of the money I pay in tax and feel good that I am supporting those in need.

Living on benefits when you can work and better yourself doesn't seem like the better option. But with the minimum wage being lower than a living wage some people would rather claim benefits.

He is versatile, he can play as a second striker, a false 9, a wide forward or a central attacking midfielder so accommodating him and Coutinho shouldn't be a problem. It isn't for Brazil. Also Coutinho's best performance this season came from out wide against Man City.

Our goals problem is being addressed and we will sign a new striker before the season starts. We are already linked with Bacca and Rondon and either one of them would be a huge upgrade on what we have already (with the exception of Sturridge). 

Our defense is our weakest link. But Clyne is a massive upgrade over Johnson and over Can being played out of position. Moreno can only improve and having a high-temp, hard working midfield trio of Can, Henderson and Milner will help the defense. You mention Gomez, Ilori, Wisdom and Toure but none of them will start that many games. It will be Clyne, Skrtel, Sakho, Moreno.

null,false,lets_chill_dude,null,null,null,"Okay, I'm liable to forget what you said as I write this comment so hopefully I don't forget anything major :p 

I'll start with the House of Lords. I used to be in favour of replacing it, but recently I've seen its value, especially on the drugs issue against the current govt. I think it's one of those odd things of reality vs theory. In theory, it should suck, as should our monarchy, and the U.S. form of democracy should be an ideal form of govt (the constitution is amazing legal work). However, in reality the HoL and monarchy function pretty damn well here, and the U.S. Democracy really doesn't. I would kick out the bishops, but overall, I think it's mostly okay. 

Second, the SNP. I don't know about GMOs, but yes they are against nuclear. I can accept this, because the major flaw in renewable energy is that it can't deal with demand when the population/ area ratio is too small. In scotland, they have a large area and a small population, so they could go 100% renewable (like sweden or Norway's situation) and so it's fine not to have nuclear. However, as climate change is a global issue, it is important to recognise that many countries are too dense to be powered by renewables, so nuclear is necessary. I accept the SNP saying nuclear is wrong for scotland, but I don't accept people saying it is unsafe and shouldn't be used. 

Finally, what pro business Things I would like. I am suggesting a large scale investment in technology jobs, focused in the north of England (and maybe a little scotland). The industries I want to see are nuclear R&amp;D, renewable R&amp;D, electric cars R&amp;D plus their manufacturing, and finally a big state owned pharmaceutical, to sell abroad, to lower what the NHS spends on drugs, and to create biochem jobs, as many of biochem grads do not go on to do biochem work, which is a huge waste of resources. 

I would also generally favour increases in our manufacturing sector. ",null,0,null,1435174779,null,0,false,0,cshevvj,null,t3_3ay5ms,null,t1_cshevvj,null,t1_cshe1s4,null,null,null,1437319861,null,1,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

I see what you mean about the Lords. However, I do wonder if the German method might be better, where their upper house is made up of representatives of the federal parliaments. It seems like Ed was advocating that sort of policy when he proposed a 'Senate of the Nations.' But I agree that our system can be valuable - I've heard they may also be looking to overrule the government with regards to votes at 16. I'd definitely kick the bishops out too.

Fair enough, I can see where they may be coming from then. I've heard that the issue of GMOs and nuclear often comes up at Green Party conferences, so hopefully at the next one it will be removed from their policies.

I'm definitely in favour of investing now. It makes sense to do so now as borrowing costs are fairly low, and in the long-run it should lead to the deficit and debt falling. I sincerely hope that we invest in some electric car R&amp;D because the electric car that the government showed off towards the end of the campaign looked absolutely awful, and we need to do better if we're going to be competitive.

Almost certainly.

/r/soccer gets about two million visitors per month. According to the BBC article a third of the UK's six million reddit visitors also visit /r/soccer. That would mean that all of /r/soccer's visitors are from the UK. Which is definitely not true.

According to the last three surveys we've had, about 22% of /r/soccer users are from the UK. That means that we get close to half a million visitors from the UK to /r/soccer per month. Which means about 1.5m UK visitors to reddit per month.

When they're checking tickets at Piccadilly, incoming passengers who have been unable to buy one at the station or on the train are able to do so at a platform-side booth. However, there's no way of checking where somebody boarded, so people can just request a ticket from the nearest station rather than from their actual one.

Northern Rail came up with the wheeze of randomly visiting such stations in the morning peak, and handing anyone boarding a particular slip of paper showing this to be the case. The staff at Piccadilly then issued penalty fares to anyone claiming to have boarded at that station who couldn't produce the slip.

Great idea.....until someone realised that this breached the Conditions of Carriage, which does not give a TOC the right to issue or require any such extra documentation, and took it to court!

(The renovated Manchester Victoria now has barriers, as does Oxford Road, and Oyster-style cards are on the way, so it wouldn't surprise me if Piccadilly gets barriers soon.

There is a [recent similar case there](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/3arc7q/applying_for_brit_citizenship_and_wondering_how/)

Secondly, there are a few problems in this sentence; ""I am a 24 yearold American male, the child of an American and a Brit born on a US military base in CA."" (1) Who was born on the base? Is there a comma after ""Brit""? (2) CA=California? (3) Wait and see, we'll come to this.

Thirdly, your mother was not born on British soil, she was born on British-occupied German soil. So her citizenship was not by birth in a qualifying territory. Don't try to pull this one with any Home Office/Passport Agency paperwork or you might have to apply twice and pay twice. Embassies are always a nightmare; get it right first time. So you go back one generation....

Fourthly, you need to clarify what your grandfather's role was. He needs to have been in Crown service and to have entered employment in the UK. If he was in HM Diplomatic Service, no problem. There is a tiny chance he worked for some oddities of the occupation regime like the [British Frontier Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Frontier_Service) or [BFBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Forces_Broadcasting_Service), which sometimes recruited locally, in which case you might be unlucky. But that's a tiny chance so...

Thirdly, the answers to your questions:  
1. Yes, congratulations, you have probably discovered you are a British Citizen! You can get a passport. That sentence should have read, ""I am a 24-year old British and American male..."" :-)  
2. You have the right to emigrate (well, go home!) to the UK. However, a lot of benefits are restricted to EU residents. In particular, your situation for universities will not change for the first three years, so you'll pay international tuition fees (typically £5,000-£10,000 p.a. for postgraduates) and won't have access to loans. After three years' EU residence you will be treated equally with other EU citizens (home rates are about £5,000 p.a. for postgrads). As of 1 April this year, even NHS treatment is only free for ordinary residents. That means you'll have to pay for at least the first six months, unless you can prove that you've left the US for good and are not going back anytime soon (roughly speaking).  
3 and 5. You will certainly need your mother's (and grandfather's) birth certificate, a signed photo, and the passport application forms. u/multijoy has explained these points well. Start with your mother. I think you'll need to know the country (Eng/Scot/Wal/NI) district where your mother and grandfather were born, obviously the dates, their full names, etc. [If it's England and Wales, apply at the GRO](https://www.gov.uk/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate).  
4. It's much, much better to do this in the US than on arrival in the UK. You might be able to get the birth certificates delivered more cheaply to a UK address, but 2 weeks is quite tight timing.

Fourthly, the US Government is now quite relaxed about dual citizenship for US citizens by birth (immigrants to the US are different).

Setting interest rates doesn't make much difference ether as there is no freedom within the global economy and there is already plenty of difference within the country so it is not extended or made more attractive if that freedom is removed. People like the simple answer to their problems rather than the right one they find it easier to put the blame on the currency rather than look at the internal economic circumstances which lead to the problem. Greece is just the worst example and lack of full recovery is due to the policies in place which are designed to keep the rich rich instead of the economic well being of everyone. Ireland for example is on the path to recovery it's unemployment rate went down to 10% for the first time within 7 years while remaining in the Euro for example so I can not see why that couldn't be true for Greece.

40% of your income doesn't disappear. 40% of every £1 you make above £31,786 per annum is deducted. Of the £31,785 below that limit, £10,600 is tax-free, and the rest is taxed at 20% - meaning you're taxed £4,237 on £31,785 and below, which increases to £7,084 after £2,847 is added for NI. Whether you feel that's fair or not, or whether the higher tax rate is fair plus your pension and repayments on the student loan, claiming you lose 40% of your income is plainly untrue when your taxable deductions *before* the things you tacked on amount to &lt;23% under £31,785.

&gt; Everybody is blaming Chalobah which isn't right IMO. They are playing a 4-2-3-1 without a play maker in the center and expect Chalobah and the other DCM to be the play makers. Your team is going to fail if Chalobah is attempting the most passes. It's like expecting Jedinak to be a playmaker. He was expected to both create the attack and play defensive midfielder since they had Ings playing in the central attacking midfield role. Ings cannot play this role. Ings is not a passer and utterly failed to create anything on the attack. Ings wasn't the center of the attack; never had the ball on his feet; didn't pass.

But keep in mind that Firmino will play much more advanced with Brazil then I assume Rodgers is going to use him with Liverpool. Brazil doen't have an real proper striker, so Firmino is kinda of the man who's suppose to make those runs in behind. But he's not a real striker so he tends to actually make runs towards the sidelines, something I dont think we'll see when he wears an LFC shit. I'm assuming BR is going to play Firmino right behind our striker, whoever that may be so that he could run off of him but also be the one to make that final pass, aka a true attacking midfielder, and push Coutinho off to the left a bit. Brazil played with a 4-2-3-1 type formation last game, with Robinho acting more on the right, Coutinho on the left on the attacking end of things, while Firmino was sole man up top. What's interesting is that Firmino would drop further back on the defesive end than those two, but would receive the ball further up. This is why I think BR likes this kid, he fits his mould in the sense that he will chase the ball down. Willian was also in the middle but mostly interchaging with Coutinho/Robinho depending who occupied what, but he generally got the ball out wide out or right on our half. Over all very dynamic attacking front end but still missing that target man, which Firmino is not. So lets see how they do, but don't think this is how he'll play at LFC.

Not to mention many economic models exist within a very narrow set of variables which in reality fail to translate into the real world where there are many endogenous/exogenous variables. 

So what I'm getting at is you're right that there have been many worthy contributions by free market economists,  yet the reality is that a mixed economy is most probably the best way forward.

Congratulations you have done very well out of this system, but you didn't get to that point in a vacuum. Why do you begrudge paying back your fair share? 

Your pension contribution is not 'lost', not only is it a taxable benefit but you get it back when you retire and if it's like a lot of pension schemes there is scope to get it back before then. 

The queue at the job centre is because there are no jobs. There are 1.86m unemployed people in this country and Universal Jobmatch (the system you must use if you are on JSA) currently shows 832k jobs. From my experience using this system around 1/3rd of those jobs are straight up false listings designed to farm data or MLM 'opportunities' disguised as paying jobs. But I'll be generous and assume every single one of those jobs is genuine and for simplicity's sake they match up perfectly with job seekers and we could fill every job tomorrow. That still leaves over a million unemployed people. They are not shirkers or scroungers, they are people that want to work. 

Depression is not a soft illness, and unless you are a qualified psychiatric expert you do not get to make that assessment. There is a difference between being sad because your life is shit (which is another issue) and having genuine mental health issues, and there are experts out there that can tell the difference, and do.

Unemployment was always high, especially since industry was moved to cheaper countries and local steelworks and mines were closed.

It's pretty isolated, there's a small train line through it but its hideously expensive infrequent and the last trains run from larger towns at about 7pm. Bus services are pretty scarce and expensive too, all transport is pretty empty most of the time due to the expense, I guess the companies put up prices to compensate for lack of use maybe?

Anyway, my point.

The town has pretty decent education, it's got a very upper class grammar school and a large secondary school.

So on the one hand you have kids that have a pretty decent education, but no mobility due to lack of employment due to lack of industry locally.  Most people can't afford to commute, kids leaving school, even though educated are a bit trapped unless their parents are lucky enough to have jobs. 

Driving lessons are damned expensive, running and buying a car even more so.

There simply aren't enough industry or commercial jobs to support the town.

http://www.voxeu.org/article/major-public-debt-reductions-lessons-past-lessons-future
Are good starting points, and the citations in those articles will give you a wealth of literature on this. Alesina, Perotti, and Corsetti all have several papers that are worth a read.

On taxes:

One of the most significant studies on tax rates in the US by Romer : http://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6716271.pdf 

&gt;The resulting estimates indicate that tax increases are highly contractionary. The effects are strongly significant, highly robust, and much larger than those obtained using broader measures of tax changes. The large effect stems in considerable part from a powerful negative effect of tax increases on investment. We also find that legislated tax increases designed to reduce a persistent budget deficit appear to have much smaller output costs than other tax increases

The above IMF study also has some interesting stuff on hiking taxes being severely contractionary.

Quite an interesting one from Barro: http://wcm.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/28276/economics-wp232.pdf

&gt;In a post-1950 sample, increases in average marginal income tax rates (measured by a newly constructed time series) have significantly negative effects on GDP. When interpreted as a tax multiplier, the magnitude is around 1.1. The combination of the estimated spending and tax multipliers implies that the balanced-budget multiplier for defense spending is negative. We have some evidence that tax changes affect GDP mainly through substitution effects, rather than wealth effects.

On minimum wage:

http://www.nber.org/papers/w12663.pdf

Is a good summary. Shows how diverse the range of empirical evidence is.


There are literally thousands of studies on this stuff. I'm just picking those I can remember off-hand. Look for literature reviews on these issues if you're interested.

null,false,joshtfx,null,null,null,"Why support Chelsea? Sports fanship is inherently arbitrary so there are many excellent reasons to support Chelsea. 

Foremost for many people is the quality of football. Chelsea are a very, very good team. In the last fifteen years the team's style of football has tended to prioritize defensive excellence with a muscular midfield and somewhat pragmatic but effective play, typically powerful counterattacks. In the past couple of years the squad has been augmented with very talented attackers like Eden Hazard (a top 5 world player candidate) and Cesc Fabregas (a former Arsenal hero). Chelsea's recent traditional style of play is perhaps best characterized by Diego Costa - an aggressive but stunningly good striker. 

A second reason is the management. Chelsea have arguably the best manager (head coach) in the world, Jose Mourinho. He's charismatic, smart, funny, snide, and talented. He is tactically excellent, although perhaps overly defensive, and can change a game with substitutions. He is quite special. As a bonus, you don't have to deal with Mourinho from the opposing side.

Third: results. Chelsea are a successful team and are current champions. Perhaps that makes you a bandwagoneer, but no more than supporting any of the other big clubs, except Liverpool. Chelsea contend for key trophies every year which makes them exciting to follow.

Four is status. In the 1960s Chelsea were a hip club - they are based in  West London after all. They tended to underachieve but were popular nonetheless. In the mid-2000s the team qualified for the Champions League (which is kind of like the NCAA basketball tournament that plays concurrently with the subsequent regular season). After qualifying, they were bought by a Russian billionaire who invested heavily in building a first rate squad. Many fans of other teams are jealous of Chelsea's success. For a while they were hated and perceived as arrivistes, but sustained success and a new nouveau riche club (Manchester City) have given Chelsea a degree of big club legitimacy.

The kit. Chelsea blue is gorgeous and striking. We never have bad (home) uniforms. Our common away colours tend to be yellow, white, and black, but it varies year to year. 

In short, it doesn't really matter why you pick Chelsea. I'm not convinced any reason is better than another when it comes to sports, but Chelsea are good, going places, in some ways classy, are generally cosmopolitan, and have nice uniforms. Blue is the colour. ",null,0,null,1435180769,null,0,false,0,cshiv11,null,t3_3ayowz,null,t1_cshiv11,null,t3_3ayowz,null,null,null,1437322506,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

null,false,onGlassDoors,null,null,null,"&gt; I can't tell you how painful it is to watch 40% of your income vanish in income tax alone

No, you fucking can't, because you don't pay anything close to that. We -- like the rest of the developed world -- [use marginal taxation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RU6kHupY50). Your income is sliced into chunks, and different chunks taxed at different rates. [At current tax rates](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates/current-rates-and-allowances):


* The first £10,600 is not taxed
* The next band of your income (the slice between £10,600 and £42,385) is taxed at 20%
* Any money that falls into the next band (£42,385 to £160,600) is taxed at 40%. 
* Any income over £160,600 gets taxed at £45% (This is pretty rare as, if you're earning that much money, you have a clever tax accountant to ensure that you pay at an effective tax rate lower than us peons in the lower bands).

An example:
&gt;You have £45,000 of taxable income and you get the standard Personal Allowance of £10,600. You pay basic rate tax at 20% on the next £31,785 (£42,385 minus £10,600), then 40% on the final 
£2,615. You pay a total of (£6,357 + £1,046 =) £7,403. 

**That's an effective tax rate of 16.5%!**

NB: £45k is *way* above the UK median income, even for graduates living in London. If you're worried about your take-home pay -- much bigger than most of the country's pre-tax pay -- my heart bleeds for you.

I can only assume you're being disingenuous with that claim, because there's no fucking way that someone as dedicated to the economy as you claim to be hasn't (a) heard of marginal taxation, or (b) read his fucking payslip. I mean, seriously.

&gt;Council estates for full of these dynastic families of benefits scroungers and it has to end.

The 'no-one has worked in generations' ""dynasties"" only exist in the imaginations of the Daily Mail. UKIP and Tory politicians have referred to them, but refuse to give any sources of where that ""knowledge"" came from (studies, surveys, or pure supposition?). Numerous groups have gone looking for families in this category (all sorts of researchers who want to want to work with them, to understand what can be done), and not found them. 

Even if they do exist, according to the office of national statistics, [benefit fraud accounts for just 0.7% of the total bill](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/426914/FandE_IG_May15.pdf), 1.1bn of 168bn. Overpayments due to fraud are pretty close to overpayments due to the government's own clerical errors (1.1bn vs 0.7bn, respectively).

Benefit fraud sucks, I agree. But how many people do you want to see homeless, reliant on food banks or committing suicide (all of which have rocketed under the Tories' ""purge"" that you voted for, and hope to again) in order to stick it to those 0.7%?

null,false,WakingWoes,null,null,null,"&gt;But should that someone be the government, or should it be their friends/family and charities?

Why should their families be burdened with the financial drain of supporting somebody unable to work? What if the person in question has no family, and due to the nature of their disability, no friends?

It's also evident from pre-welfare history that private charity is not a reliable way of caring for those who cannot care for themselves. Victorian Workhouses, indentured servitude and even Bedlam itself are all emblematic of this. The money has to come from somewhere, which usually leads to the destitute being exploited.

&gt;should disabled people be made to do something for that support, in the same way that everyone else has to do something for money and isn't just given it for free? 

You think that families, friends and charitable organisations should care for the disabled for free, but not the government? Besides, it was already established in the premise of your question that these people _cannot_ work. 

&gt; I am asking in a moral sense, should they have to do something symbolic that represents the inconvenience of work so that workers and non-workers are treated equally.

That's the most Harrison Bergeron thing I've ever read. Do you really want to punish people for being so severely disabled that they can't care for themselves? I'm honestly concerned that you wrote this out and posted it publically.

&gt;For example, even something as simple as not being allowed to watch television between 9am - 5pm like a normal working person wouldn't be able to.

Style? We used to play hoofball and it was shit to watch. This last season with a fresh squad we were playing, not so much possession football, but midfield focused football. And our midfield was made up of mostly our local young players such as Mowatt, Byram, Cook, and Taylor, with a couple of appearances from Phillips.

Now without going to games, it's pretty hard to watch Leeds. Sometimes we play on TV so you can find streams online, but other than that you can get the excellent radio commentary of Noel Whelan on BBC Leeds.

Ironically, you've picked the two times to use as evidence where he doesn't hack.

The first time, The Doctor guides him through the system and tells him what exactly to do. You can barely calling it hacking since he was literally typing in passwords given and clicking on things as told.

Fast forward a year and we're onto series 2. Clearly, he's gained some skills but not much. We can see he attempted it, or something since it isn't made clear, but he always got locked out. Hardly a successful hack.

Having said that....we can clearly see him ""hack"" his way into a computer in the Cybermen two-parter (which always seemed odd to me). Not entirely sure how that happened but oh well. The point is he leaves home in the story he first shows any sign of abilities and leaves the universe in the story he shows proper capabilities. He doesn't really get much chance to show and has never shown it since.

We do know he doesn't have any decent qualifications so this can be a major factor. Hell, a lot of people who DO have major qualifications in something end up in dead-end jobs anyway.

I've never understood why everyone is so willing to let the government govern the things we do with our own bodies. I don't understand why it's a good thing that the police can step in and stop you from hurting yourself.

I was once nearly convinced that because we have the NHS we all become invested in other people's wellbeing. If I'm giving you money, I should get some kind of say in what you do with that money, certainly in a democracy. The problem with this argument is that people do things that risk their health all the time and we don't think (for the most part) the government should step in and stop them.

That momentary blip aside, I've always been astounded at the ignored obvious line that can be drawn between what the state governs and what it doesn't: if I'm directly hurting other people the government should have a say in the extent to which I'm allowed to do that, if I'm directly hurting myself then it shouldn't.

I get that everybody in this particular debate genuinely wants to help people. I really like that about this topic (as opposed to abortion or euthanasia debates).

Soldiers who **joined** the army at 16 were more likely to die in Afghanistan does not mean that 16 year olds are being sent to Afghanistan and dying in great numbers.

Example: If you join the army at 16 you and you slog through the two years before you turn 18 in Britain then get deployed at 18 +1 day and then get killed you will be included in the statistics that you are quoting above. In fact one of the hypothesis proposed by the author is that people who join at 16 have longer careers than those who join as adults and therefore are more likely to get deployed and then killed.

&gt;Another probable contributing factor is the longer average career length of 16 year old recruits who successfully complete training, leading to more tours of duty in Afghanistan when compared with adult recruits.

16 year olds are only allowed to be deployed in extreme circumstances if there is no other alternative and as the study also mentions 16 year olds are mostly stationed in frontline combat roles because they lack the experience to be suitable for technical support roles. Which is bad news for 16 year olds (I say bad because I remember being 16 in uniform so I kinda get what they are thinking) because in a frontline combat role they can be replaced by just about any ol' Tommy so there is no real need to deploy those 16 year olds. While at the same time the technical roles tend to be the ones were there is a shortage of personel and you really need to deploy the guys that you can scrape together regardless of who they are.

I've bolded your sections to make them stand out more:

**Are you certain? ""Practice until you get good"" is not really helpful advice to someone who doesn't handle any social situation well, let alone an interview.**

Why not? The best way to get good at anything, anything in this world is practice. And there is nothing that through practice you cant improve upon. To make your example, yeah maybe you aren't good at social situations, so before you practice interviews practice being comfortable in social situations, take baby steps and move on from there.

Or alternatively, choose a profession that doesn't require a lot of social interaction, become a computer programmer, or a trader.

**""Study until you get good"" is also not really useful advice to someone who never even learned how to study properly, particularly as learning as an adult is far more difficult.**

Study how to study, then study the subject until you get good. Almost any individual can do this.

Learning as an adult is not more difficult, it is easier because adults have more focus, more discipline, and more motivation than children or teenagers. However yes time is more of a constraint.

**The sort of things you are saying are part of the problem, people have been saying those things for decades and guess what? It's still happening. So saying people ""should"" do something is all well and good, but can we move in to reality and talk about what they ""are"" doing? Yes, people who are bad at interviews should learn to get better, but they aren't, so what can we do about it?**

We cant do anything other than offer them the opportunity to get better by giving them the chance to practice interview technique. Beyond that they are the ones that have to be determined to improve.

There are standards for HMO's, which in *some* areas have to be licenced and inspected prior to letting, and there are standards for private rented accommodation which *should* be observed but these are *not* statutory protections for the tenant with criminal penalties attached - they concern the council's relationship with the landlord alone and the enforcement is exclusively civil. 

A tenant can complain and environmental health might turn up in 6 months and issue a letter to a private landlord requesting changes and threatening legal action if they don't undertake the prescribed work, but enforcement only takes place for serious multiple breaches and its a ponderous process. This does not affect the contractual relationship between landlord and tenant - it most certainly does not overrule the contract in the slightest which is an entirely separate legal document dealt with mainly by the county courts.

As to the small claims court you cannot take landlord/tenant (act) disputes to it, as it deals with money alone.

Big pharma has the funds (and reward mechanisms) to pretty much monopolise clinical trial research into new treatments.

There's no profit to be made by discovering something any person can grow in their own garden and make in their kitchen is a helpful cancer treatment.

We are also focusing on youth development. There are heaps of youth players being promoted. Garbutt, Stones, Barkley (yeah, he had a shit season but so did everyone else, he'll come good), Galloway.

Ah, the United argument. There were plenty of occasions in Ferguson's first few years where his job was on the line and there are articles from the Manchester papers from that era calling for his head on a plate. Can you imagine what things would've been like if the board had listened?

null,false,CanIBreakIt,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt; Many people, especially in London, (albeit somewhat morbidly) only have a chance of buying a house through inheritance. Sad but true.

As someone who rents in London I can see that.

But the current inheritance tax is £325,000 where as the average home is priced around £270,000 last I heard. So abolishing inheritance tax isnt a means for the average person to get the property ladder. Also morbidly most people will receive that money in their 50s, not when they need it in their 20s/30s. I dont see how the current tax prevents inheritance being used for homes/deposits and letting the richest get out of paying tax isnt going to help. For a start the rich will just invest that money in property anyway, driving up prices.

Personally I favor a number other approaches to addresses housing.

1. expand social housing

2. recognise this is a supply and demand problem which the market will not solve on it's own, to that end:

3. Build enough homes to cause a property price crash (increase the supply)

4. Tax profits of Land Lords, restrict foreign investment, especially of homes in London (decrease the demand)

However no Tory or Labour MP is going to implement any of that, so we're stuck with measure which just pump more and more money into the existing housing stock.

&gt; For example the tidal generator that's planned for Swansea is a brilliant idea.

I had not heard about that, looks very interesting.

&gt;I'm not entirely sure how you ""force"" someone to work more than 48 hours a week

Actually in most low paid contracts say you will be required to work additional hours from time to time. The Working Time Directive limits this to 48 hours over an average of 17 weeks. 

It is meant to be opt in only and is illegal to require someone to sign it. But most companies sneak the opt-in with the rest of the contract by adding an additional page to sign at the back. Making it look like it's a non optional part of the contract. I've known people who signed that who were then required to work 60+ hours during a staff shortage and it takes 17 weeks to opt out again.

My advice is to never sign it. Remember it's averaged over 17 weeks, so it wont stop you from doing a little overtime.

&gt;I'm pretty sure that forcing somebody to work when they don't want to is the definition of slavery.

If by some miracle, they also re-opened the line to Bangor, I still don't think there's anything to be gained from an extra North-South service. Trains can travel much faster on the longer route through England than they would on this line.

The current journey time from Bangor to Cardiff is 3h 58m, going via England.

Look at the route map posted, a train from Porthmadog to Machynlleth takes nearly 2 hours. So does Carmarthen to Cardiff. So if you teleport nearly 50% of the proposed North - South route, you've matched the current journey time.

Yes, it would be a godsend for the likes of Tregaron, Pen-y-Groes and Aberystwyth. But it'd also be very expensive. I'd imagine it's not even close to economically viable at the moment, before the whole ""Welsh Assembly only care about Cardiff bla bla"" stuff.

[BR3](http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/~/media/royal%20navy%20responsive/documents/reference%20library/br%203/Br3book/ch54.pdf) is the RN single service guide, Ch 54 Art 5403 Sub-para b refers. 


The full quote is below, but the TL:DR is that you have six months in which you can quit regardless of age (discharge as of right, DAOR), and you can give three months notice to quit if you're under 18, and a CO can waive that notice period if circumstances dictate (I.e an individual is seriously unhappy and staying would be likely to cause psychological harm, hence the old term 'unhappy under 18' for this type of discharge). There's all the detail you could possibly need in the link for the RN, the other services have subtly different regulations but are broadly similar.  



""Further to Para 5403 sub para a, ratings and other ranks who have served for six months retain a statutory right to end their service up until their 18th birthday by giving notice in writing to their CO. Ratings and other ranks wishing to leave the Service under this regulation will be required to complete a notice period of 3 months. This will act as a cooling-off period, providing the safeguard of a period for reflection in which the Under 18 may rescind a hasty and subsequently regretted decision and, as such, if an individual revokes their written notice to the CO, their entitlement to be discharged as of right will cease. There will be no limit to the number of occasions on which someone can apply to leave before their 18th birthday. Someone who gives notice at the final opportunity, namely the day before their 18th birthday, may serve until the day before they reach the age of 18 years 3 months.
(2) Where a person under the age of 18 submits notice under this regulation, the 3 month notice period may be reduced to a lesser period if agreed between the individual and their CO. As with those leaving within their first 6 months' service, individuals who exercise their right to leave before reaching age 18 will not have any reserve or recall liability. The provisions described in this paragraph should be used instead of the former Discharge SHORE Unhappy Under 18 category which is now obsolete. COs retain the power to discharge an individual regardless of age for other reasons but they should generally not consider individuals unsuitable because they have previously exercised the right both to apply for discharge and to remove that notice.
(3) On reaching the age of 18, ratings and other ranks who are still within their 6 month statutory discharge period as a new recruit will have the balance of this period to decide whether or not to leave.""

Personally though, if there's ever to be a *proper* north to south line it'll have to follow the route of the A470 (which itself roughly follows the route of part of the old [Mid Wales line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Wales_Railway)), so trains going from Cardiff though Brecon, Builth Wells, Rhayader, Llandloes, then continuing to follow the A470 to Blaenau Ffestiniog and Llandudno Junction.

What I said was that statutory protections for *tenants* would be a good place to start. Statutory Government safety standards for types of rented accommodation are *not* protection *of* tenants *from* landlords any more than the British Standards Kite Mark is protection of the consumer from harm - they concern quality standards and/or safety of product, not individual rights in a dispute. 

The only way a tenant can fight a non-financial, eviction, or semi-financial dispute with a landlord is in the civil courts (you would know this if you knew what you were talking about). I really don't know why the SCC is so important to you - it offers a service to landlords for rent arrears and has little use for tenants.

Anyway this isn't a discussion, you're completely wrong in what you had to say, and saying it with crass embellishments just makes you sound dumb.

As to UKIP, they really need to cut their obsession with Islam, it's getting pretty boring and they're doing their one-trick pony routine. Firstly, Muslim students are not somehow less deserving of representation or the ability to make requests of their university regarding their wishes than any other party of students. Secondly, universities do have an element of social as well as academic care towards their students- it's not just about passing an exam but also ensuring that students as people are cared for, which includes religious activities for those willing. Thirdly, I doubt in any decent sized university, the provision of one room, either temporarily or on a more permanent basis, for social or extra-curricular activity is going to be making an excessive demand. Certainly in the case of religious groups, no-one would bat an eyelid if it was a Christian Union or Secular Society making the request.  

 My old university actually had a permanent mosque building within one of the vuildings, and this actually served to benefit everyone, as it allowed for the ISoc to run their own consistent schedule of programmes and activities in the security of knowing that they had the correct facilities to do so on a permanent basis, as well as allowing for the running of a permanent Islamic library (open to everyone, not just members), Arabic-only events (useful for any languages students) and ethnic meetings, various programmes with international students (not limited again to just Muslims), the regular prayers and special events for festivals.

Lets face it, Labour isn't going to win any seats in Scotland in the next ten years (Scots tend to go through quasi-religious periods where they favour one party for long periods of time). 

But as long as there is a National Labour party, the Tories can say, Vote Labour, see them pander to the Scots.

A separate English Labour party signals putting English needs first.

Of course there's an issue of what will happen if Scottish Labour MPs and English Labour MPs disagree - but this is a purely *theoretical* thing, in reality there arn't going to be any Scottish Labour MPs (there's only one solitary Scot-Lab MP now and he could lose his seat in the next election).

&gt; **St Mary's Churchyard**

&gt;Earlier this year the St Mary's Churchyard Heritage and Access Project was awarded a Heritage Lottery Grant of £69,100, this widens the scope of the original proposals (landscaping, planting and access works) to include a more community focused project with plenty of activities and opportunities to be involved over its three year duration.

&gt;The Heritage Committee invite you to join them at a **Community Open Day** on 27 June (10.00 - 16.00) to launch the project. Go along and find out about the plans for the Churchyard, the importance of preserving St Mary's heritage and the opportunities the project will present.

&gt;On the day there will be guided tours, live music, artists at work, the Moseley Society History Group will have a display, there will be a craft tent, a self-guided heritage trail and homemade cakes and scones. The opening at 10.00 will be assisted by The Rt Revd David Urquhart, the Bishop of Birmingham and our MP Roger Godsiff. In the meantime, there are opportunities galore for volunteering - from gardening to family history research, event planning or acting as a guide.

&gt;If you are unable to get along to the Community Open Day but would like to chat to a member of the Churchyard Heritage Committee then please e-mail stmarysheritage@livings.me.uk and either the Project Manager, Becky Greenhill or one of the Committee will contact you.

No, but are you trying to tell me you also did? If so please tell me how regularly you watched the Turkey NT and Atletico for the past 5 years. In fact I would be extremely intrigued to hear that, and your explanation to why you would watch another club and country which you have no direct relationship with, regularly to semi-regularly for half a decade.

&gt; What can you really tell us that we don't know about a player that plays for a big club

Ummm everything? If you think you understand everything about a player based on some stats and some online ranking sites then you are clueless, and I mean that in all seriousness. This is what I expect from some kids playing FIFA.

&gt; How about telling us how many goals and assists he had last season?

Sigh, this statistics game is getting out of control. If you want to know what a player is capable of you ask the people that watch him regularly, not berate them because you saw some numbers on a website.

&gt; You are really deluded. You are really losing it.

I don't know why I entertained you this long, its clear you don't have the maturity and respect to have a proper discussion. Cheers mate.

* The calls and PPI industry will carry on for a bare minimum of a year and a half of this writing.

* Companies contacting you don't care if you've had PPI, just that you've had a credit agreement and haven't signed paperwork to -check- if you have PPI.

* If we check 5 agreements and only 1 comes back, we've still made a profit.

* If you don't want the company in question to call you, politely ask to be put on the Do Not Call list or **TELL THE CALLER YOU HAVE BEEN DECLARED BANKRUPT**. I assure you it will do more to dry up the calls.

* If you are called by a robot, that's illegal but reporting the company won't really do much. Do it anyway if you think you're telephone Batman though. If it's a human it's flimsy legally but usually they're okay to call you via opt in marketing, iOS and similar services apps have **very** sketchy TOS. The caller is usually uneducated, bored, desperate and/or addicted to class A drugs, don't reason with them just ask to be put on their Do Not Call list or tell them you are declared bankrupt.

* If you are sick of these calls read this and this alone. Do not say you are **not interested**, you will get more calls.

*If you have had a credit card/loan/mortgage/car finance agreement in the last fifteen years CHECK FOR FREE (moneysavingexpert.com) if you are owed PPI as you did not have to request, agree and in some cases even have it clearly laid out in a statement to pay for it.

To verify, I checked through old stories on our signings last year to find statements by Rodgers about the new signings. According to articles about Emre Can last year from thisisanfield.com I found the following: 

An article dated 5 June where the signing of Can is officially announced. http://www.thisisanfield.com/2014/06/confirmed-liverpool-agree-deal-bayer-leverkusens-emre-can/

An tweet from LFC official twitter dated 3 July where Rodgers first is on record speaking of Can. https://twitter.com/LFC/status/484700928512360448/photo/1

Keep in mind that the transfer window doesn't official open until 1 July. So it may be that we can't actually talk about players until it's official. I wouldn't take his silence as evidence that he has been fired or anything malicious. Instead it's more likely that he is on vacation or that he's just not allowed to discuss transfers until they are official.

A good, rather unorthodox way to start is with Wikipedia. When I started off as a Liverpool fan, I spent tons of time on the wiki pages of the club, players, ex-players, managers, etc etc. don't restrict yourself to information about Liverpool only, read up about other famous players and clubs as well - you're now not only a fan of Liverpool, but also of football! I can't state this enough - watch as many LFC games as you can - you'll get a better idea of each player and their style. Enjoy the football and also critically analyse our playing style! You'll learn a lot more that way. 

I didn't have Reddit back when I started out but this sub can also be a good starting point. Read the 'top' posts in this sub to get a better idea of what's been popular over the last few years. Again, I encourage you to simply Google the names of players/incidents/epic sagas that you are unfamiliar with or want more information about. 

Last tip: Be patient! And be passionate! It took me at least 3 seasons to firmly establish my opinions and actually understand and enjoy the game. You'll be loving the highs and lows of each season in no time!

I think there is another country that goes by that name and plays against other European teams...That is definitely not Turkey you and i were talking about). Honestly, i really can't believe you would think you are the only here who watches La Liga. Goodness me! The funniest thing you said was me playing FIFA. I wish i could play, because i don't even know how to play video games. I have been watching La Liga way before Turan was signed by Atletico because i also like Valencia. Btw, i won't mind if we sign Arda Turan. Anyways, good luck to you and him.

You claimed to be able to laugh at yourself but clearly you can't, otherwise you'd have done that when I brought up your (far more) cringeworthy post. Instead you brushed it off because it wasn't recent. I found that interesting. :)

&gt;You searched through my posts, scrolling through like six pages to find a post of mine? Like what the heck? Why? To prove a point that anybody can be cringy? I didn't go out of my way to find any post fro that person... I just pointed out that their comment was cringe inducing. Not really ""duchey.""

I scrolled to the bottom of your submissions and then worked my way up. People who mock others' posts usually have plenty of to mock in their own posts and that was the case with you - there were cringey posts in spades. It didn't take me long to find that post, maybe two minutes tops but feel free to paint me as some crazy dude if it makes you feel better!

&gt;Not really ""duchey.""

I explained why it was douchey. If that comment was submitted to /r/cringe as you insinuated it should have been, and it was upvoted, then the user would have been roundly mocked and ridiculed because that's what happens on that sub - people are mean. If it's not douchey to insinuate that that should happen then I don't know what douchey is.

&gt;EDIT: WAIT!!! You created an account just to comment all of that!?!?!?! WHAT!!! Are you the person that I originally replied /r/cringe[1] to??? What the heck!?

Huh. Interesting. You say I'm odd for spending a short amount of time looking through your posting history yet the only way you could have gleaned that I created this account recently was to look through *my* posting history.

In one breath you're incredulous that somebody could look through somebody else's posting history to glean a piece of information about them and in the next breath you do exactly the same thing! It's genuinely intriguing that the rank hypocrisy of that didn't even register haha, I guess you can do nothing wrong in your own eyes, huh? Quite an ego. :D

You've definitely chosen the right club, LFC is RICH with history!! As liquidfootball stated, I urge you to watch the '05 Champions League victory. That game solidified that LFC would be my team for life. 

As others have stated, there is a bevy of info on the sidebar and the stickied post ""You'll Never Wildly Speculate Alone"" is an excellent place to keep tabs on our recent transfer moves (of which we are absolutely taking care of business already!!).

I would also suggest catching yourself up on Brendan Rodgers (never call him Brendao, BR is acceptable) and get a bit of insight into his managing style. He's given us some of the most creative, beautiful football I've seen but he's also brought some not-so-popular, wtf games. (See our final game last season). All in all, this sub has a love - hate relationship with him. 

Lastly, I would also do a bit of research on Fenway Sports Group and Ian Ayre. FSG also own the Boston Red Sox if you're a baseball fan (even if you're not, you've likely heard of them). 

Welcome to the family, bud!! 

Also, I'm giving you a homework assignment. Listen to ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" by Gerry and the Pacemakers until you either A) Cry,  B) Know all the words, C) Both or D) A jar of walnuts.

I mean true fan is an arbitrary term. I just believe actually being a part of the community LFC represents is crucial to totally understanding the importance of the club.

&gt;Under this line of thinking, God or whichever higher being you believe exists, places people in particular areas to become ""true fans"" of a team. 

lol wut? I know it sucks but you can't be a ""true fan"". That doesn't mean ""God"" doesn't love you or whatever.

&gt;For goodness sake, we live in an era where there is something called the Internet, which binds all of us and allows fans across the world to network and communicate their feelings and opinions.

Yeah and that's great. Personally I consider myself a citizen of the world. For me, sports are the last refuge of animalistic tribalism. It's what I love playing and watching them for. Maybe that's changing a bit, but I hope not; after all, these feeling are natural and it's better we get them out through sports than through nationalism or something.

&gt;I mean by no means will I ever truly understand the hardships and heartbreak of those that were born into the fandom or from Liverpool. &gt;I believe one can still be a ""true fan"" of a team. I know plenty of people that has attached themselves to a particular team and are now diehards. In the end, we all are rooting for the same team and want the same end result.

Here's the problem with the EU: the larger the organisation (no matter what, whether spiritual, commercial, or political) the greater the scope for corruption.

When you have one multi-country organisation telling everybody what to do - irrespective of historical laws or culture - then you will attract *powerful* interests determined to influence those all-encompassing laws. Particularly criminal and large commercial organisations.

Oh yes, the philosophy behind the EU is grand. It was behind the USSR, too. The problem is that large organisations do not stay pure and ideological. They become corrupt.

I don't believe, for a second, that the highest courts in Europe have not been corrupted. That the political process in Europe hasn't been corrupted.

Corruption can only be addressed in smaller pieces - and smaller countries do a much better job of purging it.

Under the old system there was a mandatory three times deposit compensation, this was quite draconian so the courts interpreted the law to allow a landlord to avoid this if they did protect the deposit before the case arrived at court. The Localism Act amended this slightly, meaning a landlord cannot escape all liability by protecting late but adding more discretion on the part of the court. It is also the case that an action can still be brought after the tenancy has ended, although a landlord cannot protect a deposit that has been returned.

It is not that you don't have the ability to bring a case, it is more that you are not a sympathetic claimant. Yes the letting agent didn't protect but you didn't complain at the time and you got all your money back. You are bringing an action purely for cash - a much more sympathetic claimant would be one who is still in a property and has a landlord refusing to protect their deposit.

I'm not saying you don't have integrity, there are many reasons why people have to pay those fees, when those agencies have for whatever reason got someone in a corner. 

But understand the only reason agencies like this started charging fees, and will carry on steadily increasing those fees is because some people are willing to pay them.

when you move house in a few years time and the next agency tries to charge you a much higher admin fee...remember its people happy to pay it, that made that happen.

null,false,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,null,"&gt; he might think he's too big for where we are at the moment

Fair point.

But if we're gonna talk in hypotheticals, let's assume he's interested.

In that case... I reckon he'd do well for us if paired with a more proactive forward. He's more like Carew than Benteke. He's not the kind of player who can lead the line alone, but will flourish if given enough support (see Italy in Euro 2012, Balotelli was always paired with a more dynamic runner, and generally played well). With Sherwood's tactics seemingly geared toward a more attacking style of play in which we get bodies forward quickly... that could suit Balotelli.

I mean... I like Balotelli. I think a lot of the criticisms of him are unfair, and he just needs to be in the right environment to dispel all the negativity around him, and get his confidence back (his time at Liverpool seems to have broken him, tbh; no swagger about him anymore).

I think it hasn't worked out for him at Liverpool because he's just not used to having to chase down every ball etc etc (though, contrary to popular belief, he tries). For Villa, that's Agbonlahor's job usually. So let Gabby use that pace that terrifies defenders, and let Balotelli support in a deeper role, using his strength and technique to help create chances, and then his own speed to get forward and give options in the box (where he *will* score if given chances).

OK.  The UK has a lot of anticyclone weather systems that sit over our country for long periods of time i.e. no wind. Especially when it's really cold and therefore when we need the energy most. 

Today is typical, big [anticyclone high pressure system](http://i.imgur.com/Lg04Mdu.png) and we're under [1% of our wind capacity.](http://i.imgur.com/bA1FczS.png) It's been like this for a few weeks now. 

But, if you really want to see the true picture here's the complete [dataset from last year.](http://i.imgur.com/wieoqoQ.png) ( I collected and graphed the data myself. ) For our 8GW capacity you can see from the graph that it rarely goes above 6GW, the average is around 3.5gw and a lot of the time the turbines aren't even spinning. And then you have to have spinning reserve i.e. gas powered generators running 24/7  to be available off-line for when the wind drops. 

And then there's the cost. 

Just not a good solution for the UK. At all.

He was the one outstanding midfielder in 2013/2014.
This year, only De Bruyne was more outstanding. But still, Firmino did a great job.

Liverpool got one of the most promising midfield talents aside of De Bruyne. And they got him at the right time. Last year would have been to early for him. This year he is ready for the next step and in my opinion he will lead LFC to the next championship in the next 1-4 years.

In the beginning with Hoffenheim he was a clown and a not concentrated teenager. He learned to stay calm and see things realistic, with both feet on the ground. He became father, husband and a solid footballer with this little extra you want to have in a Brazilian. He will be the next superstar for Brazil if he keeps his attitude and will to learn.

One thing could hinder him... his mind that may go out of the roof. But with his development in the past 2 years, this is unlikely to happen.

Pros:

* Dribbling
* Passing
* Positioning
* Selflessness
* Brazil skills
* Strong
* Shot
* Work rates

Cons:

* Doesn't score all the time
* International experience (getting better with the copa this year)


LFC was lucky, that Hoffenheim didn't reach the EL. If they would have, Firmino would still be playing for Hoffenheim. Why? Because he knows that Hoffenheim has one of the best and modern youth programs in germany that can push players like him. Still he wanted to play international and Hoffenheim couldn't get him what he needs. I am happy that he didn't go for ManU. LFC is the wiser choice, as LFC seemns to be a better place for players like him. LFC has what it needs to push a player like him.

Ivan Orlovsky (Founder of retraction watch):

And the other speaker at the event, Deborah Blum (a relatively high profile chemistry professor and a Pulitzer prize winning journalist):
http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/16/sexist-scientist-i-was-being-honest.html

In addition, Deborah Blum had specifically asked him about his comments at the event:

https://storify.com/deborahblum/tim-hunt-and-his-jokes-about-women-scientists

I'm not sure that an anonymous account of what was said that no one who was at the event has publicly verified holds much weight with me when compared to this.

In addition, Connie St Louis has specifically addressed this new, leaked transcript:

&gt; “The words ‘now seriously’ make it very clear that I was making a joke, albeit a very bad one, but they were not mentioned in the first reports and I was deluged with hate mail,” Hunt said. He did not say this, nor did he praise the role of women in science and in Korean society. I wish he had; things would have been so much better.

http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/23/stop-defending-tim-hunt-brian-cox-richard-dawkins

Edit:

I'll add in a final point, from the article it claims:

&gt;But a leaked EU report seen by The Times supports Sir Tim’s claims that his remarks were an “idiotic joke” and not meant to be taken seriously.

&gt;A European Commission official who was at the lunch for women journalists and scientists offered a differing transcript from the account compiled by three reporters present.

I've been to plenty of international meetings and events with European Commission officials and they have never once made a transcript of the events. They might have taken notes but no one has ever sat there and transcribed verbatim what was being said by the speakers at the event so I find it incredibly suspect that there just happens to, 2 weeks after the event, be an anonymous transcript lying around of what was said that doesn't agree with anyone there.

Even more suspect, according to the Daily Mail (as I can't access the original times article):

&gt; A journalist also claimed at the time that Sir Tim had had 'thanked the women for making lunch'. But in the report, the official said this categorically did not happen.

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3136897/Sexist-Nobel-winner-went-praise-women-scientists-controversial-comments-jokingly-branded-chauvinist-monster.html#ixzz3e45JtWOY 

Now I'm not sure if you guys are familiar with how transcripts work, but they pretty rarely document all of the things that a speaker does not say. So in fact, this ""transcript"" was a report, presumably written from memory after the controversy broke (and if it was a recording that was transcribed after the fact why not give that to The Times?)

Even worse, we can't actually see the report, the Times was shown a copy of it but not given one themselves. That's about the lowest tier of reliability I can imagine. I can go and make up an ""EU report"" and let it be ""seen by"" The Times right now, I've got the right letter head format sitting on my hard drive, it's not exactly hard to do.

The left can't decide what their core message is - they couldn't sum up what they offered in a simple statement. That makes it difficult to choose them because it's hard to say what you're choosing.

The tory message is simple and one line: ""money at all costs"". It has lots of content within that - money by creating tax breaks for the rich, punitive measures against the poor, privatisation even at a huge loss, and so on. But the core message is always there and easy to understand and choose: if you want money and don't care what happens to make you have it, you choose the tories.

What the left should have done is take the exact opposite, creating a one line proposition around a fairer society, looking at the person beside you instead of into your wallet.

That should be the real point in this - oversight. There are lots of good reasons why the Police should have the operation capability to do this. Mobile phone records can be vital in finding a misper, or tracking an escaped criminal. They can also be vital in building evidence in conspiracy-type crimes. Even though this might be humdrum police work, if it means the more efficient use of police resources and convictions that stand-up to scrutiny, it is arguably a worthwhile endeavour.

The necessity is, however, no excuse to abandon transparency. This sort of thing needs to be managed in a way which precludes mission-creep and allows people to understand the process. Of course, the operational side of things needs some secrecy, but the general principles should be open to inspection. The recommended proposal of court based approval - just like for house searches - is a good measure of that.

I think there is also an issue of the culture within the police, which has encouraged overreach and secrecy, which is a different problem to be tackled.

null,false,synthesezia,,Belfast,null,"London, for a few reasons:

- **clubbing** - as ridiculous an excuse as it seems, I'm well into electronic music and the scene in Belfast is about as monotonous and boring as minimal techno. London has way more choice and each weekend there's something to do if I'm bored, with something I really want to go to at least once a month. I was flying over here to go out or go to festivals a few times a year so I'd met a fair few people who already lived here and are regulars at various nights so I was able to move over here with a bit of a crowd.

- **career** - I'm a web developer. There were 2 companies I wanted to work for in Belfast and I was already working at one of them and knew everyone who worked for the other one. The company I worked for was having troubles paying the wages and London seemed to have way more opportunities. I moved here for a job expecting the grass to be super green but in reality got let go from that after a month and then worked somewhere that bored the tits off me. Less than a year into that I managed to get a job at one of the most exciting places in the UK to work for and I'm pretty happy here.

- **events** - I've already talked about clubbing but everything else like comedy, art, theatre, museums is obviously amazing here. Even random shit going on is way better. I walked out of my flat one day and found a New Orleans style jazz band playing a cover of 2 Unlimited - No Limit. You wouldn't get that on Malone Avenue.

- **politics** - After a while it really grinds you down. I'm really not sure if there's been any major steps forwards in NI since I left nearly 3 years ago and I follow the news pretty closely. London and England is by no means perfect but it's less bullshit than back home.

- **change** - Belfast is the same old stuff, week in, week out (near enough) with the same people. I grew bored of it, that's all.

There are downsides though:

- **rent** - paying 700 for a room in a shared flat is the norm. I paid that for the middle sized room in the grottiest flat I've ever lived in sharing with 2 horrible human beings. I'm in a houseshare now with mates and have the biggest room and pay 760, it's a lot nicer though. The wages do make up for it though. By simply moving here I got paid an extra £9k. I had a similar amount of money leftover after rent as I did in Belfast.

- **settling here** - only move here if you're OK with the thought of never owning your own home in London. You'll need to move in with a SO or earn a shitload of cash to even have a chance of getting a mortgage. 2 friends tried to get a house with their combined income of ~£90k and couldn't get one.

I'm unsure how long I'll stay here. Maybe go to Berlin or the US next depending on work. I'm highly considering going contracting as my wages will basically double overnight if I do that and saving up for a few months to go travelling but who knows.

If you consider Belfast to be too quiet and boring and are OK with paying stupid amounts of rent to be able to stay out all night drinking cans of Red Stripe for £4 a dark room in a converted warehouse listening to repetitive electronic music you'll love it.",null,0,null,1435226764,null,0,1435228443,0,csi31yk,null,t3_3axjqd,null,t1_csi31yk,null,t3_3axjqd,null,null,null,1437335013,null,4,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,4,null

Doesn't particularly mesh well with these media portrayals of the situation. On top of that, there's this defence in the Nature journal of someone who worked with him quite a bit, saying she never thought he treated her any differently in any environment, nor did she feel discriminated against by him:

I would say that it would be a good thing for these services to be available to help people with some of the problems caused by them being unemployed, however this move by the government strikes me more as an attempt to almost program people into a particular way of thinking. A way of thinking that fits their philosophy, almost of unemployment itself being caused by the mindset of the unemployed. That they should be re-programmed into drones. Quite an emotive way of saying it, but I wasn't quite sure how else to do so.

Of course, in some cases people will be unemployed because of having anxiety or being depressed and so on. Whether it is chronic or reactive. So treat (or manage in the case of something like BPD / Bi-polar) those conditions. Some people will develop problems as a result of being unemployed - it isn't nice, it is stressful - so a lot of people will develop some kind of reactive depression, caused by unemployment that in turn will hinder their chances of employment in one way or another.

So if the UK’s population growth remains at [500,000/year](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33266792), how crowded will Britain get? It certainly sounds like a lot of people.

At that rate of population growth, it will take the UK 35 years to reach a population of 82,120,931 in 2050, at which point the UK will have the same population density as present-day Japan, at 337.1/km^2. 

That puts things into perspective. People in Japan enjoy a high quality of life, and the country is full of huge swathes of rural land and areas natural beauty in addition to large cities. That level of population density is hardly the end of the world. Many would in fact consider it desirable. More people, bigger economy, bigger businesses, bigger military, more global influence, more global trade, more cultural activity.

Assuming the same area of land use per person, urban land use would increase from 6.8% to 8.7% with a population of 82,120,931. Still not anything close to an urban jungle. And with likely greater use of high-rise buildings, the land use per person would likely go down, so the percentage would probably be lower (as it is in Japan).

Of course the distribution of those people in the UK will be uneven, most likely centred around London, Birmingham and Manchester. But this does little to displace the comparison with Japan, since Japan also has very uneven population distribution. Compare the northern island of Japan, Hokkaido, and Scotland:

Scottish population: 5,327,700

Scottish land area: 78,387 km2

Hokkaido population: 5,507,456

Hokkaido land area: 83,453 km2

Japan is just as full of large, empty spaces as the UK is. 

But what about the infrastructure point? Surely the UK's infrastructure can't keep up? This underestimates how long it takes, and how much it costs, to build infrastructure.

The main constraint on infrastructure isn’t time or population, it’s the budget we have to build it. Take as an example Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, which serves the entire city of Norwich and a large amount of the surrounding area. It took 3.5 years to build at cost £229 million. Five new hospitals have been built in London since 2000 (St Peter Baptist Hospital, Queen's Hospital, Evelina Children's Hospital, Princess Royal University Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital). If you have the money to build it, infrastructure can keep up with rapid population growth. 

This can be further demonstrated by a historical comparison. The population grew from 38 million in 1901 to 46 million in 1931, or 32% in 30 years. A growth to 82 million in 2050, on the other hand, is the comparatively slow 27% growth in 35 years.

As migrants contribute to budgets via taxation as well as use services, they do not contribute to budgetary strain. EU migrants are a net benefit to the treasury: EU immigrants made a [net contribution of £20bn](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1114/051114-economic-impact-EU-immigration) to UK public finances between 2000 and 2011. We have the money: compare the extra £20bn of tax revenues from migrants over a 10 year period to the £229 million to build a hospital. The UK could have built 87 new hospitals between 2001 and 2011 from the extra tax revenues from migrants alone.

The real issue at the moment is housing, but that's a political issue. Everyone knows the solution, which is building more houses. It doesn't have to be a problem, it's simply political forces are keeping it a problem. Eventually, the tide will turn and the pressure will be too great for the government to deny relaxation on planning regulations.

&gt;You can invest in a **tax-free account for your child**, **like a Junior ISA** or Child Trust Fund. This means tax won’t be deducted from the interest.

Emphasis mine. Considering the language, although I sure there is a more intricate set of rules elsewhere, I would argue that because Cash ISAs are tax-free (as per [this HMRC page](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts)) and it is *like* a Junior ISA that they were also exempt.

Historically according to  [this 2007 archived HMRC webpage](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/isa/faqs.htm#11) (particularly under the headings ""*I am under 18 - can I have an ISA*?"" &amp; ""*Can I put money into an ISA for my child?*"")  the £100 allowance would also apply to money in a Cash ISA. It is also worth noting that back in 2007 there used to be a different set of ISAs for under 18's (i.e. Mini &amp; Maxi ISAs) but these no longer exist. 

Nowadays ISAs for under 18s are called [Junior ISAs](https://www.gov.uk/junior-individual-savings-accounts/overview) and for those 16-18 there are also [Cash ISAs](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts). S&amp;S ISAs have an age restriction of 18+.

The problem is not with every part of the Asian community, ""Asian"" covers a very large variety of people, and the problem is not with ""Asians"", but with a *very specific* ethnic group; [Mirpuri Pakistanis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mirpuri_community).

[The Mirpur district is quite a small area](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Mirpur/@33.2083572,73.7267234,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x391febeacef31ea1:0xe3401eaca262ab78) Yet it is estimates 60% of British Pakistanis are from the Mirpuri district. It is easy to see then how gangs would form, since Mirpur is a relatively impoverished area and much of Mirpuri farmland was flooded (by a dam). There is essentially a displaced Mirpuri community living in Britain.

The problem is that both the British state and the majority of British people are ignorant of such cultural nuances, and as such attempts to integrate the community failed. Resulting in angry young men, who, without a sense of cultural or community belonging, formed gangs. The targeting of young white girls comes from the fact that in most Asian countries being pale is seen as a mark of beauty. Their lack of any moral compass comes from a lack of education and a lack of cultural cohesion. It is a sad fact that without institutional systems to keep them under control pretty much all people become murderers and rapists.

The way to cure this cultural disease is through education, not through targeting innocent ""Asians"" most of which won't even be Mirpuri Pakistanis.",null,0,null,1435229728,null,0,1435231285,0,csi3qtq,null,t3_3b1oaa,null,t1_csi3qtq,null,t1_csi39nb,null,null,null,1437335284,null,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13,null

“Let me tell you about my trouble with girls. Three things happen when they are in the lab: you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you and – when you criticise them – they cry.”

So in order:

""Let me tell you about my trouble with girls"" - he has personal issues with girls. They are his comments, not issues with women but himself.

""you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you"" - put this in context of him dating most his partners via lab work, including his wife who he cares for. It's quite easy to see the tongue in cheek part of this. Plus, anyone who's dated someone in the same business knows it's a minefield to say the least. Now, you can argue this is sexist as it generalises women and not men, but then in context of the first sentence, why would he generalise men if he was only speaking for himself? Matter of interpretation, but it can be seen two ways - either he is talking using himself as a general guy working with general women, or he is describing a personal anecdote about just himself. Given he was addressing mostly women, and has worked to further women in science, I cannot believe the former and the latter, saying that you have an issue falling in love at work, is hardly sexist.

""and – when you criticise them – they cry.” - this is the only remotely sexist bit in my opinion. I disagree with this, but Emily Grossman said she did on Sky news in a debate even siding against Dr Hunt. I certainly don't think it's unfair to say, sociologically or not, that women tend to be more emotive about issues, but to describe that as an issue is, yes, sexism in my opinion.

So, altogether, scientist makes joke about being a bit socially inept, one remark is a bit sexist, though not hugely damaging, and it turns into a massive issue which gets him fired. I don't really think there's much more to it than that, and I don't think it's going to discourage anyone at all from participating in science. It's a mountain over a molehill. If the comments which have just been reported on really were in the speech in some form, it wouldn't really change anything - the man has already done a lot for that cause anyway, and it wouldn't excuse the crying bit anyway.

We've signed Cedric, but who knows if he's ready for first team action in the Prem. Having Clyne as first choice and Cedric/youth player as backup we'd still have quality at RB, and also be able to blood in our replacement for when he leaves next season.

Sure, we'd lost out on £8m but we're no longer in a position where that is a disaster.

I reject your assertion that the world is facing a food shortage. The world has never been better fed in its history, and this is only increasing. Advances in GM crops, and the economic development of Asia and Africa (giving them access to modern farming methods) is only going to further increase the world's food supply.

That aside, this is not an issue that the UK has to worry about so much, because we're still extremely rich in global terms. In the event of an increase in global food prices due to a famine in a significant region of agriculture, we will still be able to buy. It will cost us more money, but it's still a net gain for us (the additional population, likely working mostly in the tertiary sector, will contribute more to GDP than the cost of the food imports needed to support them).

&gt; The police have a duty of care.

...which is why they should release to you details of suspected criminals on the grounds of what exactly? The police note that suspects are approaching children at schools. Do you work at these schools? Do you work at children's homes or social/children's services? No. Because if you did, this would be your business and you would know about this already.

&gt; It is in the public interest to detail the whereabouts of a fucking gang of child rapists.

It is in the interest of those professionals who work in contact with those targeted by *suspected* child rapists to know about these dangers. 

&gt; This is simply and plainly the police being a) pathetic b) scared of 'racism' and c) classist.

The reasons for the police not making their actions public is laid out in the article you didn't read.

&gt; The paedophilic rapists were Asian, an all too common theme around the country, and Europe.

Most were Asian; some weren't. Additionally, most of the rapes and gross indecencies committed against children in this country are done by white people. But that hasn't stopped you trying to tie this particular tranche of cases into an ""all too common theme"" of Asian sexual menace. It is precisely for this kind of reaction amongst people whose opinion is basically too stupid to take seriously but too loud to ignore which explains why this report is confidential.

Japan is full of huge swathes of rural land? Not around the areas people live in. Have you visited the place?

I'm sure they'll be remedied with the fact there is space in Scotland!

You also reveal your massive dishonesty with your seamless switch from ""migrants"" to ""EU immigrants"" in your second to last paragraph. The paper [here](http://www.cream-migration.org/files/FiscalEJ.pdf) (see Table 6) shows that European migrants are a slight positive, but non-EEA migrants are a huge negative (£4bn gain versus a £118bn loss). The reason for this is that EEA migrants only started coming here on a large scale for the last decade, so they're still young. Once they age and start using pensions and healthcare, it will reflect the non-EEA group a lot more. The press release you linked is even more dishonest in only including the EU immigrants that arrived since 2000, in order to eliminate the older ones that arrived before that date and making the numbers look more favourable. This is not a surprise since it is published by the UCL, one of the universities in the UK that has a business model based largely on immigrant students. 

And you don't even touch on all the other negatives of immigration. Schools where the bulk of the kids speak English as a foreign language, holding back the whole class's language development. Waiting three weeks for a GP appointment (and you can't blame this on cuts, as it happens only in high immigration areas). Massive cultural change: I have friends that proudly identified as Eastenders, but their culture has been eliminated from the East End of London to be replaced by Bengali culture, and the wonderful ethnic-based political fraud that closed down Tower Hamlets authority.

It's not though. 16 and 17 year olds are recruited to be soldiers. They may not take part in military operations until they are 18, but the job they are being recruited for is by definition dangerous and has a higher chance of leading to lifelong psychological and physical damage than a civilian career, and I don't really think many have an appreciation for this they when they enlist. 

&gt;Why should people of working age be denied a career choice, especially one that for most people is a very positive and beneficial experience?

I'm undecided as to whether I think there should be an end to child recruitment in the UK's armed forces, but this campaign provides some much-needed balance to the MOD's recruitment efforts. If you read through the website some interesting points are brought up that I think legitimise at least calls for scrutiny of the recruitment policy. I remember when I was at school there were several days when representatives from the army came in to talk about military careers and do ""fun"" things like shoot air rifles, run through assault courses etc., and this was before we even reached recruitment age. There was no balance to it. I imagine few if any of us would have had an understanding of what PTSD was or even really why the army was deployed to Iraq at the time, but it was being sold to us as something exciting and fulfilling (which it no doubt is I'm sure) and not necessarily something that might lead to maiming or mental health issues. 

I think there is definitely a problem with pervasive armed forces recruitment when [children aged 4-9](http://hmarmedforces.com/) are the target of a recruitment/propaganda effort of the MOD. Even in the rest of the media the word ""hero"" is thrown around liberally and armed forces members are only presented as selfless and courageous defenders of British people and principles. I'm not yet sure whether we should put an age limit on military recruitment, but I don't think we should be allowing the armed forces to get a free pass with their public image and recruitment efforts. They are deliberately targeting the impressionable and offer a very coloured view of what a life in the armed forces (and afterwards) might look like, I think we should welcome the efforts of the veterans at Battlefield Casualties to challenge the only side of the story we've so far been allowed to see.

[NHS sunscreens here.] (http://www.evidence.nhs.uk/formulary/bnf/current/13-skin/138-sunscreens-and-camouflagers/1381-sunscreen-preparations) The thing is that companies apply for their product to be licensed as a drug in the UK, they give a dossier of evidence and a panel of experts reviews that. Then the NHS decides which products they will put on formulary so NHS doctors can prescribe them, then each Trust decides which will be first and second line (first and second choice, based on cost and efficacy). If companies are not putting their sunscreens forward they will not be available. Sunscreens being 'borderline substances' so not blanket prescribed there probably are not enough sales to make it worthwhile.

But yes, massive hole in the market that someone could cash in on since mineral only/ no fragrance or alcohol is also recommended in eczema/ dermatitis.

In south America you see many farmers turning to coca production over more traditional sources of food because of the money involved, which means that domestic food production decreases.

We see similar things in parts of Africa where they grow lots of food for export, for the money, but then don't really have enough left over for *food*. Part of this is the choices that we in the West, particularly Europe, make. If we weren't so anti-GMO (as a general rule) we could solve a lot of these problems. A lot of pressure is put on to these nations (financially, from pressure groups etc) to not use GMOs, and I think this is absolutely nuts. 

If *we're* the ones causing the situation by demanding massive exports in the first place then we should at the very least allow them to do it in a way that helps both them and us - and GMOs would go a long way to achieving food security for the developed and developing worlds.

If the state pension is a pyramid scheme, it is only one under certain circumstances- where the ratio of consumption by the retired increases relative to the output of the working. This happens under circumstances where:

 a) the output of the working falls due to a smaller relative size 

 b) the productivity increases of the working are lower than increasing consumption of the retired

c) the consumption of the retired increases faster than both of these

or some mixture of these. The first is very definitely happening, as is the third. Whether the second will continue to do so is perhaps questionable given- as you point out- the dramatic effects of technology.

It just pisses me off that we can go through a terrible summer like last year (which was half due to Liverpool throwing their financial and european competition clout around), still progress despite being expect to struggle massively, finish only 2 points behind Liverpool despite them taking some of our best players and investing ~£100m, and then we still aren't attractive enough a prospect to keep a player from going to Liverpool.  

I know they have more financial clout and a better chance of European football in the long term - but there's absolutely nothing stopping Clyne from waiting a season and leaving on a free to whatever club he wants, pay rise and all - and we've been offering him more money so it's not like we're just expecting him to stay out of the goodness of his heart.  

Oh well. Need another RB then. Don't know about Soares obviously but we needed depth there anyway, especially without Alderweireld to step in (and please no Yoshida at RB).
