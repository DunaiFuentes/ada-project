An obsession would be if you made a move every chance you get for any small increase you could wrangle, but weighing up the uncertain risk to playing time against the certain massive gain financially and deciding to back yourself and go for it isn't obsessive behaviour.

I strongly disagree with this. Though it is only really a comfortable fiction, part of the thinking behind our constitutional monarchy is that they should remain politically neutral. Charles has, by dint of his birth and name alone, enormous amounts of influence; there must be some sort of accountability. The idea that a letter to a cabinet minister from the first in line to the throne should be considered remotely similiar to one from an ordinary member of the public is ridiculous. For a start, something like 99% of the letters from ordinary members of the public will never actually make it to a minister's desk; they'll be dealt with by civil servants or others. Charle's letters will always be read, and they *will* influence political decisions.

By playing him out of position not only did we alienate him from his god given talent - attacking - but we killed his motivation.

Going forward Monk has played Shelvey in a position where he is asked to do what he excels at and enjoys: hammering the ball. I believe the formation shift and the addition of Cork in the defence allowed for Shelvey to thrive in his element and finally build on the great year he had before.

Shelvey is an absolute talent and his technical ability is world class. We cannot however expect him to be a box-to-box or defensive player, his talent and utility lies in the opponents half.

That to me is the right way to do things. 100k a week is not be sniffed at and if we capitulated and gave, say 150K. Then where do we go? Suarez didn't get to 200K for a few years. What message does it send to the young guys? Throw your toys out of the pram and you'll get what you want. 

That's why I mentioned the players I have as things were done gradually with them. Sign him on a 100k and agree to look at his sitaution again at the end of the year, that seems entirely fair to me. You perform, you get your rewards. Like Ronaldo and scores of other players have. 

Huge risk that the club aren't willing to take. Raheem could go on to become a world beater but as you say you just knew Ronaldo would.

Sec is a rather large field and I'm sure you've heard of security in depth but for those that haven't it basically means there are multiple facets an attacker would have to go through to gain access to what they want,  the idea of this is that either you'll catch them because it takes them so long or they would need a massivly wide skillset to be able to breach all the preventative measures in place. 

I'm concerned mainly with handling traffic from the outside,  what is or isn't legitimate and what happens to it, is it permitted or is it dumped on the far side of the gateway and the ways in which this is detected. I'm also concerned with what traffic passes across the network. This can generally be achieved through strong policies and things like reducing footprint at the client side meaning the internal factor would have to have malicious intent which reduces your risk factor as well as keeping traffic overheads to a minimum. 

To give a real world analogy imagine a train where everyone gets on at the start and leaves at the end. I can't control who gets on but it's my job to make sure everyone leaves the station where they're meant to,  route the legitimate ticket holders and ditch the gate dodgers.

It also goes operational this year, putting it around 36 months late... not really that bad for major project honestly.

If it's the F-35's fault that the MoD retired the Harrier and the Tornado before they received their replacements, is it also the P-8's fault that the MoD retired the Nimrod, leaving the UK without any sort of ASW platform?

He's now joint 19th in the Premier League (of players who have made 5 appearances or more) for chances created per 90 minutes. I wouldn't say that's amongst Europe's elite for this season, would you?
 
There will be further information in my article, I don't want to spoil it now. Something tells me it won't be for you, mind.

FWIW I'm absolutely not anti-Eriksen. I like him a lot. The fact that you've had to dredge up a two-year old tweet to 'prove' that I have an agenda against Eriksen probably tells you that I've not tweeted too much negativity about him.

Yes. Lovely. We really should have the Supreme Court of the land ruling that money is free speech and thus striking down political campaign funding legislation. No, thank you.

Ah. If it benefits a single individual in detriment of the a wider body (example: a couple of hundred renditions in the context of the body of government as representative of the ""greater good"", whatever that is) then those ""atomizing entitlements"" should not hold.

Sorry. This is not a counter point. This a collection of right wing sound bites, written by a guy whose Human Rights record includes defending the G4S activities in the Palestinian territories.

We've definitely had lawyers in Christ Church Choir in the past. The only time they say you can't be a choral scholar is when you're doing some science subjects, where your labtimes would clash with Evensong.

Another consideration is that CHCH is the only choir which sings up to Easter  + Christmas day: it's a full cathedral choir. New College + Magdalen are college choirs and usually only sing in term time (except New College certainly do recordings + tours outside of term time). Some people like just the 8-9 week thing, others prefer being able to do Christmas day etc.

The only complication you might have in being an undergrad somewhere else which isn't the same college is that they might have a little less sympathy about requests for accommodation outside of term time. As CHCH has a much longer term, you need somewhere to live at the same time when most colleges are reselling student rooms out to conferences. In CHCH at least, you get a bit more clout in being able to stay in your room.

If you're in any doubt, contact the director of music at one of the foundations. NB, Stephen Darlington (chch) is on Sabbatical this year. Most of them will be more than happy to hear you sing in advance of an audition (informally) and have a chat, and will give you a good idea whether they think it's appropriate you apply.

null,false,Patch86UK,,Labour Member,null,"/u/Moinmoiner has already given a great answer, but I'll try with a slightly greater emphasis on organisations.

1) Progress is a think tank and campaigning organisation associated with Labour with a philosophy that closely aligns to Blairism and New Labour. Now that Blair is a bit of a pariah and New Labour isn't spoken about much, Progress is the key focal point for Labour people with a more centrist ""social democrat"" philosophy.

2) Compass is another think tank and can be thought of as the more left wing equivalent of Progress. It's misleading to think of this in terms of ""Old"" versus ""New"" Labour; Compass isn't really an organisation that wants to go back to Callaghan, but it is the organisation with more left wing views. Ed Miliband's policy platform was relatively aligned with the ideology espoused by Compass.

3) Blue Labour is a ""tendency"", the core of which is several books and publications by leading adherents. In some ways, it is quite an ""Old Labour"" ideology- arguing for left wing economic policies, but a more ""faith flag and family"" social policy which might appeal to those working class voters who find UKIP appealing.

4) Socialist Campaign Group is an alliance of backbench MPs who are on the left of the party who consistently argue for a more leftwing platform than the frontbench party. They are the direct successors to the ""Tribune Group"", who took their name from Tribune Magazine, a left wing publication that has been in and out of print over recent years.

Looking to some of the more historical groups:

5) The Fabian Society were one of the founding members of the big alliance that would become the Labour Party. They originally represented the middle class Marxist intellectual types, and drew their ranks from the academic and chattering classes in London and elsewhere. These days they are yet another think tank, and not so much a tendency in their own right. They often focus on ""big picture"" stuff- typical hobby horses include constitutional reform, market reform, party structure, etc.

6) The Cooperative Party are another one of the early founders of the modern Labour Party- originally a separate party with different ideological origins, that entered a permanent electoral alliance with Labour when it became apparent that Labour was becoming the dominant all-purpose left wing party. They exist today to represent the cause of mutualism- they are the vehicle by which money from cooperatives come into the party, and the origin of a lot of Labour's mutualism policies. They directly sponsor a number of MP and councillor candidates, providing campaign funds and allowing them to stand as ""Labour Cooperative"" candidates.

7) The affiliated unions are by far the largest organisations affiliated to Labour, representing some 3 million people. They are the third of the main founding groups of the party. The degree to which you want to view these as special interest groups in their own right depends on a lot of factors, but as the originators of large quantities of party funds and of votes in things like leadership elections, they are important. Usually the various individual unions are quite capable of speaking up for themselves, but there is also an organisation called ""Unions Together"" inside Labour to represent them as a whole.

Have I missed any?

It's worth pointing out that factionalism can be vastly overstated; most people (including frontbenchers) don't really think in these terms.",null,0,null,1431591056,null,0,false,0,cr8pdh6,null,t3_35virw,null,t1_cr8pdh6,null,t3_35virw,null,null,null,1433056203,null,8,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,8,null

&gt;**The NSA’s British partner, GCHQ, and whether it is worse.** Their respect for the privacy right, their respect for individual citizens, their ability to communicate and associate without monitoring and interference is not strongly encoded in law or policy. And the result of that is that citizens in the United Kingdom[...], they’re at a much greater risk than they are in the United States.

&gt;You’ve got their own admission in their own documents that “we’ve got a much lighter oversight regime than we should have”, full stop. That’s what they’re talking about. They enjoy authorities that they really shouldn’t be entitled to. And the problem with that is, when you have an unrestrained intelligence agency that’s not being well overseen, that’s not accountable to the public, they’re going to go further than they need to. They’re going to overreach. They’re going to implement systems and policies and target people who are not necessary to target.

&gt;Tempora [GCHQ’s internet surveillance program] is really proof … that GCHQ has much less strict legal restrictions than other western government intelligence.

&gt;The UK government may publicly say, “We have very strict regulations. There’s a broad oversight. There’s intense accountability for all of these officials operating these programs”. Their own private documents, classified documents they never expect the public to see, say something very different, which is, “We have a very light oversight regime compared to all other western countries”.

Be it fat, terrible clothes, anything different.  Once you get to your twenties people just ""Don't give a shit"" as everyone is more mature and has more experience. 


To the wider issues as to why Britain has more Gay Mp's.  It's because we don't care, we're not a inherently religious country, and we place less influence on the race and religion (and therefor sexuality) on our politicians.  So long as they represent our political values by party, they'll be elected. 

Other countries will elect representatives based on religion, spouses and family ties, even race and gender.  I don't think I, or anyone I've spoken to, have discussed these issues.

null,false,LordHighBrewer,cnty-uk,Canadian/British,null,"If you're firing it, than it has failed. Deterrence works via force, and the threat of force, and in the case of trident if you are pushed into a situation where you are required to fire it, then the threat of force did not appear creditable.  Maintaining a stockpile of nuclear weapons allows us to economise to a certain extent on our conventional forces, without compromising the absolute security of the UK, as outlined under 'MAD'. Trident in particular, with its decentralised command system (letters of last resort) combined with the illusive nature of SSBNs is a highly creditable threat, and is creditable enough to deter a major state-on-state attack.

Trident must however form part of the spectrum of military capability, as well as part of the wider question of military-political leadership. It might be the biggest hammer in the tool box, but that's not very useful if you're fixing a door. Problems come when force or the threat of force does not appear creditable- such as the invasion of the Falkland islands, the first gulf war or the invasion of the Ukraine. 

The biggest problem UK armed forces face today is that successive government cuts have unbalanced our armed forces, rather like cuts to the US army in the 50s, this has left us increasingly dependent upon trident, as it has been maintained at its current level while other capabilities have atrophied or been lost. This is however where I and the greens must part ways, as the green calls for the de-activation of trident ignore the resurgence of the possibility of state-on-state action with Russia or across Europe as the EU comes under increasing internal pressure and the US pivots towards China.

This is why I believe trident still has a future as part of the UK's armed forces. Maintaining a  nuclear arsenal, combined with increased military and political support for the Baltic states makes the UK honouring its article 5 obligations a sufficiently creditable threat to ensure their continued right to national self-determination. Drawing down these forces could (most likely will) provoke an attack, and as Russia's armed forces and her nuclear arsenal increasingly modernises, we would have to accept the loss of the Baltic states as we have accepted the situation in the Ukraine, and most likely endure political and military blackmail from an expansionist, repressive nuclear armed state againist which we have no satisfactory defence. NATO, not just the UK, will have lost creditability, and countries will reject collective defence while nervously eying their neighbours. I am additionally doubtful that the green would invest the money saved in the armed forces, or actually rebalance our armed forces through proposing the large scale investment they so desperately need.

Given playing these last few games makes sense, to take Brad out of the firing line a bit and prove that he is not undroppable, but Given is not a long term solution.

But if it's one thing I've learnt though it's not to hide yourself away in your comfort zone as this tends to make it worse in the long term. You get to the point where doing anything outside of this comfort zone becomes a massive task and causes way more anxiety. 

What you really want to do ( or what I did ) is to put yourself outside of that comfort zone and learn to deal with it. This in turn reduces your general anxiety levels because eventually you start to get over yourself and when you do your anxiety levels drop to a level where it becomes manageable. Mines pretty much non existent at the moment. 

I mean, I've had some horror stories like, for example, having a full on panic attack whist walking though a crowd of 10,000 at Glastonbury festival. But... I'm the guy who then has to make my way to the mixing desk and mix the next show. And I have no fucking choice, I can't let the band and the crowd down like that. 

And the anxiety is so heavy I'm having trouble even getting to the mixing tower never mind focusing on the mixing desk. I'm dizzy, I can't see straight, my blood pressure feels like it's going through the roof, my mouth is so dry I can't even speak and I'm not in a good place. 

But you know what, I made it like some assault on Everest. As soon as I did start to focus on the task in hand I completely forgot about the anxiety and got on with the job. It was a great show too. 

I could quite easily have run away and hid that day ( And lost my job in the process ) But you can't, you just have to get on with it sometimes. Or it'll control your life.

null,false,whatmichaelsays,null,null,null,"As much as I like the idea of individual cities being given more power, I think there is potentially a massive can of worms about to be opened. 

Taking where I live (Leeds) as an example, we have a 'Leeds City region' concept (essentially a regional business development committee) and the West Yorkshire Combined Authority (which deals with transport).

There is a lot of criticism about how 'Leeds centric' the two bodies are and it's fair to say that Bradford, and to a lesser extent, Wakefield are rather unwilling members of that body. Bradford councillors certainly appear to be very nervous about being part of a 'Greater Leeds', if their recent objections to certain planning applications are anything to go by. 

My concern is that these city regions fail simply because different stakeholders start pulling in different directions over what (relatively) little money becomes available. . 

At present our infrastructure supports the idea of 'major' employment centres in particular regions (for instance, Leeds in the Yorks region and Manchester in the NW region, London in the SE), with those cities supported by smaller towns and cities (eg, Wakefield, Bradford, Huddersfield Halifax and Harrogate supporting Leeds, or Oldham, Stockport, Warrington, Wigan and Bolton supporting Manchester). You only need to look at commuting patterns around our big cities to see that. 

What is needed, IMO, is for the infrastructure to be improved to support that model. We need more trains and more carriages going into Leeds and Manchester, we need improvements to the busiest motorway junctions, we need to extend the commuter belts and we need more office space in the places that big businesses want be.  

That, however, is a difficult sell if you're a local council candidate in Bradford. ""Vote for me, because I want to make it easier for you to catch a train to get a job in Leeds or Manchester"" isn't really a good election pitch.

null,false,bottomlines,null,null,null,"I don't think so.

I agree with the SPIRIT of these laws. Here's why:

I think the government is actually coming from a good angle here. David Cameron even said that the values he wants to promote are equality and opportunity for people of all races, genders, sexualities etc. We *have* been far too tolerant of bullshit for a long time. We seem to allow people to get away with all sorts of stuff, just because it's based on religion or tradition. 

Therefore, IMO, we need stronger laws to silence people who spread intolerance. We have to think about the type of country we want to be, and we need to start actively promoting those values - not simply turning a blind eye to the things we see and disagree with. Without wanting to delve down the rabbit hold here, this is especially important when we have such high levels of immigration and most countries are nowhere near as tolerant as we are. It would be a great shame if those backwards viewpoints were allowed to spread here in the UK. People having different beliefs or cultures etc is fine, but I can't really get on board with us tolerating cultures which practice outright homophobia, gender discrimination etc in the name of freedom of speech (and we don't have any 1st amendment anyway, and the UK has always practiced limits on freedom of speech).

Secondly, with regard to internet legislation, it's a tricky area but we have to accept that most of the things we do are online now, including crime, and security services and the police need to keep up with that. Obviously some of us are of an age where we grew up during some sort of Internet ""golden age"" where it has always been above the law. But that clearly can't last. Our online identity is now a vital part of who we are in real life, and huge amounts of evidence are now electronic. Someones electronic activity is highly relevant to just about any criminal case I can think of.

That said, I don't agree with sentencing people for taking the piss out of Tim Daley's dead dad on twitter, banning encryption, or any other clear nonsense.

How I had to do all that bullshit and then I also could pick them as my GCSE choices but never had any economics, law, computer science, sociology, business or politics classes is beyond me. 

Thank fuck I love google and Wikipedia for random knowledge. Otherwise I'd be as uninformed as them voting for a party because they don't understood that they're being lied to and that their pocket money management is nothing like macroeconomics! 

I mean it's not like they're all working in factories now, no they're at university or working minimum wage jobs in mostly supermarkets and offices. Posting photos on FB asking what's wrong with their computer when it clearly says on the screen that it is verifying files on the disc. ""Oh it works now the fourth time turning it on and off!"" FFS. 

Then if it's not that it's them not voting because they don't see how it affects them and then they complain they've stopped EMA and raised tuition fees! Or the classic: ""I don't have a job here because of immigrants. We should ban them or I'm leaving this country to another one."" Great now because they spent all their English classes learning poetry and how to pass the exam, they don't understand irony, critical judgement, reflexive thinking or the economics of employment &amp; migration.

All this crap on my FB feed because the school curriculum  didn't teach them a relevant base knowledge of all these fundamental subjects. Sure they learnt about one or more of the areas they chose to study  at college or university, but the business students don't understand computers and the computer students don't understand business. 

Yes of course people won't be interested in learning certain subjects but if you don't teach them the basics of these subjects pivotal to fundamental society then they get mugged off and disenfranchised later in life. No one wins in that situation. Except the likes of Murdoch who is free to spout his right ring bullshit with full bias to a populace who are too uneducated and lack motivation to find other sources for the other sides of the argument. Look at us now at the anti-EU backlash because hardly anyone understands what it is.

null,false,Ian56,null,null,null,"Older people do not ""want"" to carry on working until later in life. Older people are HAVING to work for longer because the income from their pensions and savings is insufficient to provide a lifestyle they consider sufficient. 

This is a direct result of Western Central Bank's disastrous Zero Interest Rate Policies (ZIRP) which is a mechanism for wealth redistribution from the middle class to the speculators and the very wealthy (people like Goldman Sachs bankers and hedge funds).

ZIRP is a direct contributor to growing income inequality, which has become a major problem in large areas of the West.

As older people put off retirement for longer, it reduces the number of jobs available for younger people and also reduces their prospects of gaining promotions and higher incomes. 

This in turn has knock on effects of young people living at home for longer, getting married or starting a family later, not being able to afford their own home or have so many kids.

Politicians are often asked how much a pint of milk is or a loaf of bread, especially since the cost of living crisis we have been facing in recent years. Not that anyone actually expects that David Cameron pops down to Asda after PMQs to pick up his shopping for the week.

The end result is that politicians usually answer well above what they think the price actually is, to avoid the obvious political fallout that would follow coming in with a lower price, much worse than guessing higher.

The base rate is now 0.5% and 10 year gilts are at just over 2%. (The situation in the EZ and EU is even more extreme with zero interest rates due to ECB policy.) Interest rates have been artificially reduced from what is normal or standard by disastrous Central Bank policies and a series of asset bubbles. 

Annuities for private pensions are largely based on yields on bonds. A massive asset bubble in bonds has been created via ZIRP (the largest bubble by far in all of history) and yields are at record lows. 

It's true that people do not save enough for their retirement. But the amount that is required to fund the same retirement lifestyle has been increased by around 5 times due to ZIRP and QE. 

At some point in the future there will be a snap back in interest rates to more normal historical levels. The cost of government (and other) borrowing in the EU, the US and the UK will dramatically increase.

Currently the Central Banks are boxed in, because if they raise interest rates government deficits will rise significantly due to the increase in interest payments on the current massive and increasing levels of borrowing throughout the West (around 100% of GDP and rising). This in turn will lead to a loss of confidence in governments being able to repay their debts and further raise interest rates outside of Central Banks control.

You quite rightly point out that gender, sexual and racial equality are things which generally we'd like to promote in this country (as an example of things which are important to our society and which make it a better one to be a part of).

And you're right that it comes down to implementation. It's unfair to assume that the powers given would be used to shut anybody down who disagrees with the government, but it is a terrifying thought that it's up to some ministers what the idea of ""extremist"" is.

Nevertheless, the line *does* need to be drawn somewhere, and it's up to the people in this society to decide what kind of society we want to be. It's quite possible that the proposals *are* coming from a good place, rather than a sinister one - the latter being an easy conclusion to reach.

The whole ""being intolerance of intolerance"" thing is very confusing and invites a lot of scepticism and mockery, but if you look past the words and think about the different types of tolerance, it does make sense.

Whether it is because they fear for a loss of identity, a loss of local investment or whatever else to Leeds, it doesn't hide the fact that morning trains from Bradford to Leeds are jam-packed but the ones passing in the opposite direction are basically just 2-3 carriages of fresh air.

Maybe it's easier for me to say being a resident of Leeds rather than a resident of Bradford or Halifax, but I personally think the region is better served as a whole by supporting big regional economic centres rather than having individual towns and cities fighting to get their own ideas across and scrapping over shares of what will invariably be a relatively small amount of money and power.

Our rights are governed by legislation, the closest thing we ever had to free speech is the human rights act.

This legislation isn't about free speech, its about clamping down on those who persuade others to reject our society and its institutions because they are intent on persuading people others towards their idealistic political solution, a worldwide caliphate - islamism is a world domination theory. This law is going to be used to target the likes of hizb-ut-tahrir and the former members of al-muhajiroun, anjem choudhary and his cohorts. These groups are radically opposed to western society, they encourage muslims to reject democracy, to reject our legal systems and they use cult methods to achieve that. These ideas that do not belong in our society. These groups are the idealistic stepping stone on the path to radicalisation of young British people. Since the 1980s there has been a conveyor belt of British Muslims going and wasting their own lives and the lives of others in the name of jihad, being told they are fighting for Allah when in fact they are fighting for a political movement heavily funded by the oil rich arab. This shit has to stop and if our government doesn't try to put a stop to this then it is complicit in the mass murder of innocent people. Do we continue to allow this ladder of radicalisation to happen knowing that the inevitable result is the deaths of innocent people or do we make an effort to clamp down on the root cause of that radicalisation. Islamism is a scourge, its a post colonial political ideology developed in the 20th century  century inspired by Hegel and Marx. It isn't islam and its roots aren't even islamic.  I'm sick of seeing people die for this idea that has left a trail of death in its wake.

I personally have no issues with Islam or Muslims, they have every right to practice their faith, if we are talking about societal tenets, that tops the list for me, freedom of thought is paramount. Encouraging others to actively reject our society in order to promote your shitty outdated german/russian political theory which encourages them to go on killing sprees can get to fuck.

Indoctrination comes from passive forms of education, not active ones. 
For example, until you do an experiment in a science class you have a bias, how you think its going to be. You probably won't even question this bias until a test challenges it. 

These lessons should have no formal testing beyond pass and fail. The pass would be if the teachers think the student has engaged critically in the topic and examined evidence, the failure would come from the opposite.
In order to stop any bias from the teachers when evaluating the students you could have students cross examine each others work in some form to stimulate discussion. UKIP kids could say ""we should leave the EU"" but they'd have to cite sources and show their position was based on critical appraisal.

This form of education is known as critical pedagogy (dismissed as ""Marxist Claptrap"" by Michael Gove).
You can't remove bias from the teacher, but instilling the idea that the teacher may not know best is part of developing a reasoned world view.
The alternative is my memory of my religious RE teacher refusing to talk about Opus Dei's involvement in the Spanish civil war and another teacher refusing to accept my assertion that Switzerland is, in fact, not part of the EU.
Our classrooms are so far from being critical that to stop a subject because the teacher might be biased is laughable. Teachers are biased, students need to be educated on how to challenge bias and form their own opinions.",null,0,null,1431602766,null,0,false,0,cr8rxmr,null,t3_35xecm,null,t1_cr8rxmr,null,t1_cr8q3yj,null,null,null,1433057409,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

This is categorically untrue. The vast majority of that country (and if you broke London down, most Londoners too) take out far more than they put in. Which is partly why we run a massive deficit. 

No other part of the UK consistently puts more in than it takes out. 

London pays for much of the rest if the UK. It's our economic powerhouse. There are historical reasons for this, and massive downsides (both for London and the rest of the country) but it's still the reality. 

Of course London gets more in infrastructure. No other part of the UK comes close to trying to move so many people around each morning. A solution is to try and encourage business to move elsewhere (BBC to salford was great, and many government departments have moved large parts of their offices away, but we need to do more to encourage private business to follow suit), but the reality is that London needs more in infrastructure as things stand, not less.

It was essentially a ""pass to Bale"" strategy and he was riding high on confidence. Plus that team was no where near crap. Defoe, Adebayor, Sigurdsson, Dembele, Dempsey, were all established International level players. 

His shots per game reduced drastically after moving to Madrid because they didn't play everything through him. Bale had 165 shots on goal scoring 21 goals at Spurs vs Hazard's 71 scoring 14 goals this season. Hazard has a better shot to goal ratio than Bale did in that season. So that point of yours is moot. 

Also, most of Bale's goals that ""singlehandedly dragged Spurs into the Champions League"" (which BTW it didn't because we took that spot) were long range shots, which are low probability shots. Do you really want a player whose greatest asset is low probability shots? i.e. his greatest strength will be to 'attempt' scoring goals that most likely result in shots off target and a wasted chance.

That's not to say I won't be happy to see him on this Chelsea team. He will add pace and size that we need, but he sure as hell won't be my first choice.

I think term limits like that would actually make the situation much worse, since then you'd have careerists of a different type - people who just want to run for the glory before getting a comfy consultancy job. It would also encourage even more ridiculous short-term politics since you'd only want to do stuff in your time there.

What I think the issue is with careerists is parachuting. This is where people who've already made friends in the right places get given a safe seat in an area that they have no link to at all. The most brute-force way of solving this is implementing residency or connection requirements to candidates. In other words, you have to show at least some connection to a local area before standing.

Whether that is workable is a different matter, since it would be hard to get the balance between being too stringent and having lots of loopholes.

Take somewhere like Teeside as an example - one of the most deprived areas of the country. Geographically, it's close to Newcastle, which is doing OK for itself. It stands to reason therefore that Teeside could easily provide a labour force for Newcastle - until you look at the rail network.

There is one direct train an hour between Middlesbrough / Stockton and Newcastle. That train takes more than one hour and a season ticket costs around £230 a month - roughly one week at NMW. And people wonder why places like Teeside / Stockton are struggling. 

And that brings us back to Bradford, which is opposing a massive infrastructure projects by the name of HS2 and HS3, because they don't serve Bradford. 

People will always move to where there is work so, if we make an assumption that people are prepared to commute by an arbitrary amount (let's say up to 45 mins each way) and prepared to pay an arbitrary amount to commute, you have two options:

Option 1 is to cram as many people into a 45 minute radius around major employment hubs as you possibly can. That creates all sorts if infrastructure issues on housing, schools, hospitals, etc, and it seriously harms the towns and cities that these people leave. 

Option 2 is to increase the number of places that fall within this 45 minute radius. You do this by improving rail links to make them more frequent, faster, more affordable and capable of carrying more people. You can also do this by improving the road networks and by improving accessibility to infrastructure such as high speed internet, negating the need for as many people to move around in the first place.

There are weaknesses even in AES. It's still secure but these weaknesses can be exploited so it takes less computational power to decrypt any given passphrase. MD5 and other redundant encryption mechanisms are still secure except in the face of a determined and knowledgable attacker - that's why people thought they were secure in the first place. There haven't been any significant public breaches of AES encryption but given what we learned from Stuxnet's totally novel (unseen in the wild and only a couple of mentions in theoretical papers) MD5-collision attack, these guys are spending a lot of time and money on decryption by any means. After saying all of that, the time before decryption is still only an average under ideal circumstances - you might get it on your first guess or your last depending on passphrase complexity.

AES was actually chosen originally because the nature of the maths used in the transformations is marginally faster when compared to the Blowfish-derived ciphers. In the 90s being able to compute the encryption quickly was more important than being super secure (because nobody had access to that much computing power). These days the optimisations towards those transformations means that AES can be brute forced with drastically increasing ease year-on-year. I foresee a time when a layering of encryption methods will be applied to ensure security. Really the internet needs to move towards a fully encrypted model end-to-end if it is to survive as an open medium.

null,false,ChuckStone,yorkshire,Wenglish,null,"There are some things about politics that are *not* opinion. People don't really need to be taught opinion. Simply a case of ""This is out political system, this is how it works"", and the rest forms itself.

I was incredibly lucky to attend a secondary school that took it's role seriously with regards to developing children into effective members of society (as opposed to effective workers). At my school, General Studies was compulsory, and a large portion of that consisted of basic political education. Lessons invariably revolved around teaching staff simply winding the kids up into a debate then letting them teach each other and only really stepping in if people became too heated. There is no teacher bias if there is no teacher.

Personally though, I think these sort of exercises would be better placed being incorporated into existing lessons such as RE and History.

However, there is a problem with political education. The problem is, that as a *direct result* of people's lack of education in this regard, the Conservative Party are now in power. And they are responsible for deciding how English education progresses.

13 years of Labour government ultimately led to a massively improved education system, more inclusive and broader for all sections of society, with pass rates increasing year on year. The current government have taken great pains to re-brand these successes as failures so they can turn the clock back on a decade and half of progress... because employers want workers to know how to operate their software, but not question their decisions, meaning an ""ideal"" level of education for Conservatives means reciting endless facts, and *not* developing opinions. (Its much easier to tell people what to think if they don't have an opinion already).

The point is, my LEA was in the Labour controlled People's Republic of South Yorkshire, and according to quantitative league tables, is not particularly good. But that's partly because the league tables don't have a measure for things like ""How many of the students have a decent job once leaving full-time education"", or ""How many of the students are fully engaged in society 5 years after leaving"". It's obvious why these measures can't be included, but they are far better markers of success than mere SATs scores. The case in point is that despite a surge in UKIP support in South Yorkshire following the revelation of certain events in Rotherham, very few of their supporters are under the age of 30. Adults born after 1985 seem more capable of looking at some terrible news from an objective perspective, rather than a knee-jerk witch-hunt.

Unfortunately, the effects of any kind of educational reform take time to implement and take even longer for the result to have a noticeable impact on society. You cannot simply expect teaching staff to be able to instantly adapt to an entirely new curriculum without risking the overall education of their students. (Surely the reason exam grades have been increasing so consistently under Labour is precisely because the teaching staff became more practiced in their new teaching methods over time), and that is why we haven't seen much change yet. (2015 was the first General Election to have voters that received their primary education under Labour's reforms, and they only comprised a fraction of the electorate. The majority are still stunted by Thatcherite reforms).

From my experience both as a student, and as a trainee teacher and from marrying a teacher, and also as a parent, it seems that much of what *should* be done in schools to promote a more active democracy already *is being done*, but needs to be implemented more consistently, and we are in very real danger of undoing the groundwork that has been done because people are expecting too much too quickly and saying ""Education has changed, and it hasn't worked so let's go back to the way it was""",null,0,null,1431604698,null,0,false,0,cr8shse,null,t3_35xecm,null,t1_cr8shse,null,t1_cr8q3yj,null,null,null,1433057673,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

Teach about how this is important so that the right decisions are made. And how those decisions aren't always the *right* decisions. Perhaps hold mock elections. That sort of thing.

(I think there's a bit of a mental juxtaposition that happens. We see politicians as celebrities on the TV and newspapers every day. But at the same time, we see politicians as awful, boring people. Perhaps people's brains just melt when they try and imagine a celebrity that isn't interesting in any way whatsoever)

&gt; To whom it may concern,

&gt; I received earlier today. The fine was issued on [my road/postcode]
&gt;  for parking at the roadside on a set of double
&gt; yellow lines, which I had moved the car to temporarily just half an
&gt; hour earlier.

&gt; alternative, not just because the recent road closure (Due to gas
&gt; works) is preventing access to further parking by my house but also
&gt; because these same works left myself and my other housemates
&gt; completely without access to our own driveway!
&gt; 
&gt; Although we received notice of the upcoming maintenance and possible
&gt; disruptions to the gas supply, at no point were we made aware that we
&gt; would be left without access to our driveway, until one of the workers
&gt; knocked on our door this morning informing us that if we did not move
&gt; our cars from the drive then we would be unable to move them for at
&gt; least three days! There was no alternate parking available whatsoever
&gt; and I think it is highly unfair that we were not provided adequate
&gt; warning or temporary parking elsewhere.

A lot more transparency is needed around this area. Especially when some SPAD's are walking out with 90K a year...

For what it's worth, the last I read Alliance have two SPAD's, both started at the bottom of Payscale B (£57,300), and progression since has been in line with the NICS.

The build was simply too far advanced when the specification of the EM catapults became known for the changes to be made cheaply. That’s just the nature of programs of this scale; everything is so interdependent that making a change like this requires almost every part of the ships design to be revised. It’s absurd how much work is involved, which is why we spend so much money up-front to make sure the specs are written in stone before anything gets built.

It wasn’t an ‘off-the-shelf’ procurement either; the US are using the catapults in a different configuration to us, so re-design work was needed. This was charged to us by the US at a premium (part of the issue with declaring an intention to use something publically before you’ve done any price negotiation).

&gt;Considering the club finished second the year before and were still in the hunt for champions league it was unnecessary and disruptive.

Sure but then we lost our best player (by far) and didn't replace him and then this season we were embarrassed in Europe(again) and had an awful Prem campaign. All he said in the interview was that he wants to know if the club is going to show ambition in order to get to the top level, and that means bringing in amazing players as we've barely shown that kind of ambition over the past few years.

It's obvious the kid is pretty mentally weak, did you see all the shit he was receiving on social media over it before the interview? then he put out a tweet about it and 2 days later the interview with the BBC was out. All of the hate about him apparently rejecting £170k/week obviously got to his head and was the reason he did the interview. It's ridiculous you think it was all planned to get him more money, just look at the timing of it all.

&gt;There's a fair offer on the table on par with the clubs top players who have played longer than him, it's not like he's being lo balled. If he doesn't want to accept it, fine. But that doesn't mean we have to either.

Yes but sometimes it's not all about money, some players actually want to win things. If the club don't bring in the right players this summer the gulf between us and the 4 clubs above us is only going to get larger.

There were 3824 votes cast in the election for the position of President this year, and there are 33,609 students at the university (as of 31/01/2015). That's in the double digits (11.3%), but far from the 20% mark. If we look at the other three Sabbatical officers, between 1800 and 2100 votes were cast for each position, which puts those elections safely in the single digits. I don't feel like I was exaggerating.

I vote. Normally I end up voting RON for most candidates. Lots of students don't vote because they couldn't care less, but some don't vote because they strongly disagree. Spoiling your ballot is not possible in EUSA elections, it's an online form. 

I don't agree with the occupation either. It won't accomplish anything. Occupations rarely (if ever) do. 

""they just don't see SU politics as affecting them."". This is a central part of the issue. A lot of EUSA politics don't affect us at all, which is part of the reason for EUSA apathy and opposition. Lots of students cannot see how the Union taking a stance on geopolitical issues such as Israel/Palestine in any way affects the students here. Especially since these political issues do not come up in the campaigns. 

A large part of it is also to do with the choice of candidates. The students most likely to run for a position that requires them to take a full year out are the students with a level of political ambition that extends beyond the university campus.

Oh the old ""a million xxx can't be wrong"" idea. Well actually they can be. There are plenty of historical cases where the majority of the population have been wrong. For example, it was only a short while ago when a majority of the population of this country believed that women were biologically intellectually inferior to men, and that the best way to deal with a gay man was to lock him up in prison.

&gt; The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.

So according to your theory, despite his great speeches, and his Nobel Prize for Literature, Winston was simply ""uninformed"" and that's why he expressed his intolerance of the views of average voters in the quote above, and that if poor Winston was simply better educated, then he'd have been much more accepting. Perhaps you could tell us more about how uneducated Winston Churchill was?

The way I read that is that your main employer will deduct SL repayments from your salary as normal.  Your second employer won't because they don't see you as earning enough.

However if you declare the extra income to HMRC via self-assessment you'd be charged 9% on that £2.5k.  

So the question is do you keep quiet and hope no-one notices or do you chase HMRC to put you on self-assessment?  The normal rule is that it's your responsibility to make sure you declare everything rather than waiting for HMRC to notice, and that if you don't you can potentially be fined.

If your total earnings from all your jobs are less than £16,910 for the year,
you won’t have to make repayments. If your earnings in any job, in any pay
period, are more than £ 16,910 a year, your employer will automatically
make a loan deduction. Each employer you have will give credit for the
full £16,910 threshold. So if you earn £18,000 a year in each of your
separate jobs, that is £36,000 in total, so each employer takes 9% of
£1,090.

We do this to keep the calculation straightforward for employers.

HMRC may then send you a tax return to make a self-assessment of the
loan repayments you owe for the whole year, taking account of all your jobs
and charging 9% on all income above the threshold. They’ll take account of
the deductions already made by your employers during the year, but it’s
likely there will be more to pay. This is because each employer will have
separately allowed you the £16,910 threshold.

If HMRC don’t send you a tax return, you’ll not have to make further
repayments beyond those already taken by your employers.

Opinions are based on facts. If people are wrong about facts, then that can easily lead them to incorrect opinions. As a software developer, you may have heard the phrase ""garbage in, garbage out"".

There are surveys around that show that the British public is uninformed about many basic facts, such as how many immigrants are in this country, or how our government spends it's money. So given that many peoples opinions are based on erroneous information, it's not unreasonable to conclude that a decent number of them are coming to erroneous conclusions.

&gt; Ah yes, my anti-intellectualism. 

So why do you criticise other people for thinking that they are cleverer than the average voter? It's really not hard, given that half the population of this country is of below average intelligence.

However, I would agree that if people were more educated on basic facts, then not everyone would automatically become left wing. There are certainly smart right wingers around. That doesn't contradict the previous posters point, which was that a sufficient number (not all) of people would change their minds that politics would be fundamentally different.

&gt; Yes, Churchill understood that most people aren't shrewd politicians, and he wouldn't ask them to run the country, but he would, and did, ask them WHO should run the country. So let's use his actions, rather than speeches, as a indicator for his views. 

Again, I'll rely on one of his quotes:

&gt; democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others

I think the point is that we shouldn't put the process of democracy on a pedestal. Yes, it's the best system available (or at least potentially so, if not in our particular implementation), but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have it's flaws and it doesn't mean that it doesn't sometimes lead to mistakes.

I think you're vastly overestimating the pace of teaching in most UK schools/ When I was at secondary school we had weekly hour-long PSHE/Citizenship classes that just about managed to cover putting condoms on bananas and how important it was not to litter. I know it won't be the same at all schools but this was a London comprehensive and I imagine most schools are similar.


Now imagine trying to explain to a class of 30+ most of whom will no nothing about politics a bicameral political system, political parties, voting in a FPTP system and constituencies (and probably for good measure that other voting systems work), how the media reports on politics, the difference between local, national and european government etc.


I do think schools should be teaching pupils what they need to know in order to participate in our democracy. We have History and Politics GCSEs and A-levels and we trust (and have strong guidance to ensure) the impartiality of teachers, I don't think there would be anything wrong with having a component of the national curriculum that just taught the facts about our political system.

null,false,goolies,null,null,null,"&gt;No one thinks the police are all honest, people do however think that whilst there are thugs like this guy and his mates a lot of policemen are good guys trying to do the right thing.

Yep most of my interactions with the police have been positive (probably helped by being white and well-spoken). However whenever it's been in the case of a protest, and this includes lots of protests where no violence occurred and was clearly never going to occur, they've almost all been negative. I've been sworn at, lied to and ridiculed - and all whilst being respectful. There's definitely an ""us vs them"" mentality in the police that comes out at protests. And I think the same can come out in a lot of interactions involving those most likely to be victimised by police - usually young ethnic minorities.


So whilst I do believe most police are good guys trying to do the right thing I don't buy the idea that it's just 'a few bad apples'. It was only in January that the Criminal Justice Inspectorate told the police to re-investigate 1,700 cases of alleged police corruption that were dismissed, based on concerns about the quality of investigation. Blaming it on a few bad apples suggests it's a problem you can't get rid of - as you say screening police recruits is difficult and its impossible for any organisation not to have 'a few bad apples'. But I think that actually, though the Met especially have come a long way from the 70s, it's by no means an institution free of the problems that so much more visibly plagued it then.",null,0,null,1431613229,null,0,false,0,cr8w3d7,null,t3_35xmbv,null,t1_cr8w3d7,null,t1_cr8to33,null,null,null,1433059370,null,27,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,27,null

null,false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,null,"i remember i had torn my acl in January of 2007, i was 15 and very depressed. i went to europe for an exchange (from the states) and spent some time in france, germany, belgium and luxembourg. while over there, i had lots of exposure to stevie g, who i had been following back home for quite some time (since about 2001 is when i first remember really getting into footy, was 11, and was hard to get matches on the tele back then because it cost a fortune). it was uplifting to see him play while i was in france and i eventually got the surgery after my european trip on april 24th. later on down the road, air lingus just opened up a hub on the east coast and my dad and I on a whim decided to bike for 14 days through ireland, touching on cities like galway, dublin, dooling, visted my great grandparents graves in kiltulagh, the cliffs of moher, and even got to see william butler yeats home...what i'll remember most about that trip aside from how beautiful a country (and irish breakfast) ireland is, is when my father and i took a ferry one day to inishmore to spend the night there. When we arrived, it was pissing rain and we had to bike about 5 miles and up a big hill (which we realized we could have avoided), to get to our bed and breakfast house. We got there and took showers quickly, put on dry clothes and hit the pub. 

Mind you, this was in august...so we get to the pub right on the water and we sit down for irish stew and (my first) pints of beer. As soon as we order, we realized the aston villa/liverpool match had just started and we were excited because we hadn't been able to follow too much of the happenings because we were doing kind of touristy/biking things. As the match wore on, we went up 1-0 and things look great. That is, until aston villa scored an equalizer with something like 10 mins to full time left. I'll never forget, around the 87th minute, stevie picks the ball up in the final third and turns petrov, who decides to grab his kit and pull him back. The ref blows for a foul and we held our breath. who else other than steven fucking gerrard steps up from 25 yards out and hits a free kick sweeter than i had ever seen. the trajectory on the ball equivalent to a bell curve. the placement perfectly in the upper right corner, beating the 6ft 5 goalkeeper at full stretch. and as stevie runs to the corner flag to celebrate with a kiss to the fans and a pat on the liverbird beating heart on his chest, the announcer is going bananas yelling ""OH IT'S A BRILLIANT GOAL, ITS A BRIALIANT GOAL FROM STEVEN GERRARD, LIVERPOOL ARE BACK IN FRONT AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT IT MEANS TO THEM. STEVEN GERRARD IS LIVERPOOL'S SAVIOR AGAIN, AND AGAIN, ANNND AGAIN. IT'S AN UNSTOPPABLE FREE KICK"" 

with my old man on the trip of a lifetime to ireland, drinking my first beers at 16, and feeling down about tearing my acl, this moment will forever be remembered as one of the most uplifting ones ever. truly, when you are part of the liverpool family, You will never walk alone, and the pub was full of reds so we went bananas in the pub and started singing and chanting. 

magical, really truly magical. that will always be my personal favorite stevie gerrard moment because of the way i spent it (obviously there are better ones from an objective point of view) but this one was special to me.

I would say than in an awful lot of cases there ISN'T a right answer. Hindsight helps, obviously, but I'd say that at any given moment very few parties are doing anything that is straight up correct, or not, especially not in the scope of ""everything"". 

It's not so much that people think they're cleverer, there ARE people that are objectively more clever than others, but that VERY rarely translates into the real world to the same extent as the academic. And no matter how clever you are you don't understand someone else's situation as well as they do. They have lived the experiences they've had, and they've met the people and problems, no matter how dense they are, and this gives them a perspective you don't have, on a problem you possibly don't have, and that has value. 

I agree, democracy as it is isn't perfect, but it's the best of a bad bunch.

My gripe isn't with democracy as it stands, it's with the people that claim the moral highground because they voted left wing, and then use that position to berate anyone who is right wing, regardless of their hopes for the Tories, UKIP, etc. It smacks of ""I lost, therefore the game is broken, I don't want to play any more."". The game IS broken, but it feels more like it comes from the fact that Labour didn't get a majority through the exact same system, not inherent dislike of the system. 

Maybe it was just brought to the fore because it was supposed to be such a close election, but it wasn't a problem when it looked like a close race.

Assists are important because players that make the pass immediately before the shot that scores the goal are as in short supply. It's not easy and your post appears to make and more importantly easily disregarded.

The approach you have instead adopted which can be summarised as - ""ignore assists, key passes is where the real action is at."" - is flawed. As Opta describes a ""key pass is a pass that results in a shot whatever the outcome of that shot"". So, it appears that your position is that a stat that measures passes that end with any shot is more valuable than a stat that measures a shot that ends with a goal and I cannot imagine that to be your position.

I have no clue what /u/windycoys article might be about but if its look at the trend direction of Eriksens output it won't make good reading in terms of passing, passing acc, shots, SoT, assist or KPs.

No doubt most young people seem to come with a built-in sense of bullshit detection on the internet, but far too many people of all ages will read something in print and take it at face value.

One of my favourite examples is the use of weasel words, particularly in the *Daily Mail* and *The Sun* (but special attention paid to the former), where they'll start an article about the EU or immigration with an actual statement of fact (although filled with loaded terms, and slightly misrepresented), like: ""[EU bureaucrats on Tuesday tabled a rule mandating that all cars sold in Europe after 2017 must have a built-in computer that tracks your car's movements.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECall)"" Then, that will be immediately followed by something like: ""**This could mean that...**"", and from that point, the rest of the article is just a creative writing assignment. Brussels ministers can press a button and disable your car? Sure, put it in! All satnavs will only come in French? Why not! Brussels will start collecting tolls to use British roads? Sounds great! At no point will they focus on the actual intention of the eCall system, which is to record on-board information like an aeroplane's black box, useful in the event of an accident, and will also automatically dispatch the emergency services. Furthermore, the standard hasn't even been agreed to, and it's still just a concept at this stage, much less a legal requirement. So they can get away with saying 'rule' instead of 'law' or 'directive'.

&gt;Thank you for your email and congratulations on my re-election.
 
&gt;I was grateful to you for contacting me about proposals regarding surveillance and can assure you that the Government will always do whatever is necessary to protect the British people. Conservatives in Government have protected and increased the budgets for the security and intelligence agencies and counter-terrorism policing. However, the scale of the threat to our country from a number of terrorist groups remains serious, and the rise of ISIL in Syria and Iraq has created new havens for terrorists from which attacks against Britain can be planned, financed and directed.
 
&gt;The nature of the threat we face is making it more difficult for the security services to identify terrorist plots – especially thanks to new technology. I believe that we must always ensure our outstanding intelligence and security agencies have the powers they need to keep us safe. At the same time, I will continue to reject any suggestions of sweeping, authoritarian measures that would threaten our hard-won freedoms.
 
&gt;I am encouraged that the Government will keep up to date the ability of the police and security services to access communications data – the ‘who, where, when and how’ of a communication, but not its content. Communications data is used in 95 per cent of all serious and organised crime prosecutions, and every major counter-terrorism investigation over the last decade. As more and more time is spent online, the ability of law enforcement to access this data is declining rapidly and dangerously.
 
&gt;New communications data legislation will strengthen the UK’s ability to disrupt terrorist plots, criminal networks and organised child grooming gangs, even as technology develops. It will maintain the ability of the authorities to intercept the content of suspects’ communications, while continuing to strengthen oversight of the use of these powers.

Your argument fails on the culture basis. In that an organisation will have a subculture contained within. I've seen it in big work places with 200 people. It is made and enforced by the individuals who make up that organisation from the top down. It protects itself and maintains itself. Those who rebel against this are quickly rejected and spat out as they are a threat to the culture.

Therefore any good people are quickly harangued and pushed out of the organisation. Anybody who wants to keep their job accepts, embraces and embodies that culture which perpetuates, entrenches and causes the barrel of apples to be self selecting to ONLY be bad apples.

Could you define ""sensible things""? As far as I can tell it is a very ""sensible"" institution all round.

&gt; rather than just accrue powers 'because that's what governments do'.

What specific powers has it ""accrued"" recently? The European Council is still by far the most powerful institution in the EU, so I do not really understand what this is aimed at.

&gt; The Guardian article argues we shouldn't leave the EU because some of the money we give the EU we get back in the form of research grants.

For the third time, did you even read the article?

If you had done you would know that is not their only argument and actually most of the things you have said (ERC already works with most westernised countries including the ones you listed, suspending Israel recently due to the Palestine Issue)

From the article:

*Not only do these launch the best British scientists onto the world stage, but British scientists have earned more back in grants than the UK has contributed in every year of the scheme’s existence.*

*Then there are the EU Marie Slodowska-Curie mobility fellowships, which support EU scientists to come to Britain as postdoctoral fellows – the main drivers and heroes of bench science in many disciplines. British labs were awarded over €1bn between 2007 and 2014. Again, we receive more than we put in, as we received almost double the amount of money than the next best funded country, Germany.*

*More than in most other fields, success in science absolutely depends on movement of people.*

&gt; That's nonsensical and wont persuade anyone.

For people that actually read the article its very persuasive.

&gt; but none of it is really dependent upon the ERC being an EU only organisation. So the points moot really.

You are right, its dependent on the ERC being a supranational organisation funded by its member states.

&gt; There is a significant difference between the way the unemployment rates are reported in the US and UK. In the jargon the US reports the U3 rate, the UK something more akin to the U6 rate. The difference between these two is that the UK is reporting all of the long term unemployed (but not discouraged workers, those completely divorced from the labour market) while the US is reporting the short term unemployed and not the long term (and also ignoring the discouraged).

Then we were told children needed more time on phonics, being tested on the use of adverbials in passive clauses and learning which kings and queens ruled throughout history.

We are told that teachers are now responsible for identifying cases of neglect, genital mutilation, religious radicalisation and for reducing teenage pregnancy.

It is the fault of teachers when we do not win olympic medals and when an Englishman doesn't win Wimbledon.

Whilst teachers are told what they must teach by way of a national curriculum that is mandatory, they are blamed when children do not know general knowledge facts that are not included.

When a child is bullied it is the fault of the school teachers who should have excluded the perpetrator yet Local Authorities like Nottinghamshire fine schools £10,000 for every exclusion they make.

Over the last 40 years school teachers have been the reason for every perceived failing in British society. Not one week goes by without a politician or leading figure commenting on how ill prepared our children are for dealing with whichever issue is currently headlining the news. ""The solution to this would be that schools should do more to [insert one of countless world/british/societal problems here]""

Apply for your teaching job now folks! Britain understands and appreciates you.

I wonder if there are some alternatives to ""schools should do more to...""

Maybe the media could avoid scaring families into not allowing their children to play outside?

Increasing opportunities for children to play different sports of an evening rather than writing essays?

investing in the poorest communities and reducing poverty?

etc.

Oh, and the OP's problem... How about *talking* to your children around the table at dinner times?

Now, I don't know if RoSPA have looked at the right evidence and evaluated it correctly, which is why I didn't say anything for certain.

I have just now had a slightly better look around and found two things.

1) A number of reports claiming or suggesting that 20mph limits increase accidents. In every case I looked at, these reports are disingenuous. They rely on a gross error - so gross that I have to assume it is deliberate - misrepresenting data to imply a false conclusion.

2) Some better sources. [This](http://fullfact.org/factchecks/speed_humps_20_mph_limit_zones_plenty_Portsmouth_KSI-27588) seems like a good impartial overview of the state of the evidence available.  [This](http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b4469.full) study published in the BMJ looks pretty good.

My initial conclusion: All the good quality sources I found concluded that 20mph zones* significantly reduce casualties. All the sources I found that suggested otherwise had obvious flaws that allowed me to immediately and absolutely reject them.

Good enough for me, casually. Now, if I was responsible for making *policy* on this matter, a thorough reading of all the studies linked from the above pages and others would be the very least I would require as a starting point!

The need for targeted recruitment of a few top players as there is no embargo looming this season.

Improving financials, possibly to break even point.

Of course on the other hand his lack of clarity and aggressive questioning from the media was always likely to bait a man like that into getting aggravated.

I was disappointed to not get some clarity on Redders, I do think he should be given another run, or at least be told of his position sooner rather than later.

But I mean most people seem to have made their mind up already one way or the other, Massimo is either the messiah who can do no wrong, or he's the devil that needs to go. Probably more feeling the latter these days.

Personally I think that he hasn't done enough right for me to think he's a good owner, but not enough wrong to be a bad one. It's a matter of perspective too, who came before ""permanent embargo bates"" and GFH bringing us to the brink of admin... and who would replace him, as yet unknown.

&gt;""THE CRACK OF THE PISTOL SHOT WAS LIKE A PING PONG BALL STRIKING THE TABLE""  
---&gt; This could relate to how Larry let Francis win the table tennis match at the wreck centre, and that Larry's suicide is simply a sign of how he still has the power to manipulate Francis, through persuading him not to shoot him. However, the fact that Cormier writes this as ""ping pong"" rather than table tennis, could also indicate that Francis has overcome Larry's influence. This is because, earlier on in the novel, Larry states to Francis that 'ping pong' is more than a game, it's 'table tennis'. Francis later corrects Arthur Rivier on his comment that he won the 'ping pong' tournament, despite at this time, Francis has knowledge of what Larry did to Nicole. By this point, Francis perhaps uses this term, as he no longer values Larry's thoughts and has broken away from his oppression

80% of the jobs that have been created since 2009 have gone to the 55 to 69 age group because people cannot afford to retire. This leaves few jobs for the 16 to 54 age group where unemployment has soared (the number of jobs is far below the increase in population.)

null,false,LordHighBrewer,cnty-uk,Canadian/British,null,"First I would like to address the figure of £100 billion, as it is the vastly inflated estimate arrived at by the CND. They have taken the upper limit of all the cost estimates, while including some further accounting regularity- particularly with the price of the warheads, and arrived at this figure. Secondly, they have often pressed that this is an 'upfront cost' instead of an estimate of the long-term costs of the project over its estimated 50 years or so of remaining service life.

Secondly, while America does have a major stake in servicing the UK's nuclear deterrence (and this is in no way acceptable) it is important to understand that the UK's deterrent is predominately one of 'second strike' i.e. to be used after an nuclear attack, not to launch one itself. This is why letters of last resort are carried, and a number of measures are enacted to decentralised control and to ensure an effective 'dead hand trigger' as it were. 

Many people have argued that these missile could not be launched without the US's approval. I would argue that there are two questions associated with this-would the US withhold targeting information from it's major ally after both have suffered an nuclear attack, and secondly, how much information is required to launch these missiles after a nuclear attack, with the answer to the former informing the latter. Targeting information for Trident is not arrived at solely via the GPS system (as some have argued, and which is subject to American control), but also independently electrically supported gyro navigation (ESGN) and other means carried aboard the SSBNs, crucial when a nuclear strike has likely wiped out the command and control systems and severely disrupted communications.

This effectively makes them automatous, with launching authority solely under the command of Royal Navy officers, removing US interference and not requiring the active assent of HM government. Furthermore, if GPS information was requested in the combat stage, it is unlikely they would withhold if they have suffered a similar attack.

Again, I must ask, if you can see a system which provides an alternative that can deliver the same or better results at an equivalent or lower cost, I would be happy to hear it. For the moment, I can see no option but to maintain the deterrent, while seeking to ally diplomatic pressure to prevent proliferation and encourage the disarmament of other nations- particularly the US and Russia.",null,0,null,1431616655,null,0,false,0,cr8xz9d,null,t3_35uq9m,null,t1_cr8xz9d,null,t1_cr8wt3r,null,null,null,1433060328,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The thing he needs is the mental game. He makes a number of very good passes, but he doesn't have Bentaleb's calm on the ball.

I think it'd actually be dumb of PSG to loan him. I think he needs another 2 years studying under Thiago Motta and he could be one hell of a replacement in their system.

I spend most of my time over at r/Scotland which has become a bastion of independence supporters (like me), and there is definitely a tendency to silence opposition. Part of the problem is that, after a while, the only people who stick around to argue against the majority are the crotchety, argumentative type, who get a kick out of inciting down votes and, to be honest, rarely contribute anything of value to the discussion... But even the rare, fair points of criticism get downvoted with regularity.

But the 2012 tie between us and Barca, we'd have progressed maybe twice max. See the difference?

I don't see Bayern Progressing that much. And the only reason I think they won the second leg of the CL was Because Barca let off the peddle and subbed Suarez off. 

&gt;I wouldn't say easy but that it is expected. And we get no special praise for managing it even though its not that easy. I'm not sure why you think Pep would have found it hard to make the semis. 

Because making it to the semis is not easy regardless the team you manage.

It's more of a philosophical guideline than a binding agreement. But if you didn't want to your politicians to sign and ratify something that explicitly states ""ever closer union"" then you should have done something about it when we joined.

I think the problem is they already are taught in a rather bland objective and unbiased manner.

Everyone has bias and they are born in a world where parents, politicians, media and celebrities have strong and influential biases.

They should actually be taught to recognise bias, instructed to declare it in any work they produce (ie. bias is not inherently evil - it is simply to be understood and categorised) and how to minimise it in any scientific studies.

This would mean teachers having to set an example by actually declaring their own biases up front.

Doubly False. Whilst we get a disproportionate amount of the ERC money, we are still a net EU contributor and would have more money to spend on science if we left the EU. It's also highly plausible that we could continue to contribute to the ERC and retain any benefits outside the EU.

&gt;you should have done something about it when we joined.

How old do you think I am? The Rome treaty is from the 50s and we joined in the fricking 70s. The EU has always been billed as a free trade and free movement organisation. If the goal is now a Euro nation I think they better be a tad more clear on that so the UK can vote to leave.

Anyway, you can have the last word, euro debating is tedious and it seems like there is going to plenty of that in a year or two.

The ECHR (not the HRA) temporarily delayed his extradition but did not prevent it, and it was not delayed on the grounds of the right to a family life, but because it wasn't clear that he'd be treated humanely in the US. [They have a poor track record in that area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp).

Abu Hamza or not, you're really misunderstanding the facts here. What you describe is illegal and punishable under UK law. There's no reason to deport someone for saying those things: They'd go to jail right here in the UK. The HRA does nothing to prevent that from happening.

The deportation thing has come up mostly when people were accused of crimes in other countries. The right to a family has *in some cases* been used to prevent their deportation, but obviously has *never* been successfully used in the situation you describe, for the reasons I have already stated.

[Here is what Liberty has to say on the matter](https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/human-rights-act/human-rights-act-myths):

&gt;Depending on the facts of each individual case, a person’s right to a family life may be interfered with in some cases if deported. Home Office policy is to consider the facts of each case, including the reason for the deportation (i.e. whether a serious or minor offence has been committed), the length of time the person has been in the UK and whether the person has, for example, young children born in the UK or a British spouse. This is the type of balancing exercise that would as a matter of policy be carried out by the Home Office regardless of the HRA, but the HRA has provided greater transparency, accountability and oversight of Home Office decisions in this area.

So under the HRA, we can still prosecute and deport dangerous people. The HRA makes it clear when this is acceptable and, because it sets out a clear framework, makes the process more transparent than it was before the implementation of the Act.",null,0,null,1431621131,null,0,false,0,cr90mtv,null,t3_35xj4z,null,t1_cr90mtv,null,t1_cr8zudk,null,null,null,1433061579,null,7,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,7,null

Its nice that you continue to omit the actual arguments and simply create this one single narrative for yourself.

You must inherently be Eurosceptic when you simply ignore mine and everyone elses previous statements. Its very disingenuous of you.

&gt; It's also highly plausible that we could continue to contribute to the ERC and retain any benefits outside the EU.

Source? I highly doubt you have anything that comes close to ""highly plausible"".

&gt; How old do you think I am?

Eurosceptics are generally older people. So I would guess 50+.

&gt; The Rome treaty is from the 50s and we joined in the fricking 70s.

We joined the EEC in the 1973 and had a referendum on membership in 1975.

&gt; The EU has always been billed as a free trade and free movement organisation.

No, it hasn't. Its pretty disgusting that you can still insist this when the founding treaty of the EU's predecessor explicitly states ""ever closer union"". Are you having difficulty understanding the political ramifications of ""ever closer union""? It is quite clear where the EU is heading. If the UK simply wanted an economic union then we would have joined the EFTA and not the EU.

From the Treaty of Rome:

*DETERMINED to lay the foundations of an ever-closer union among the peoples of
Europe,*

*RESOLVED to ensure the economic and social progress of their countries by common
action to eliminate the barriers which divide Europe,*

*AFFIRMING as the essential objective of their efforts the constant improvement of the
living and working conditions of their peoples,*

*RECOGNISING that the removal of existing obstacles calls for concerted action in
order to guarantee steady expansion, balanced trade and fair competition,*

*ANXIOUS to strengthen the unity of their economies and to ensure their harmonious
development by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the
backwardness of the less favoured regions,*

*DESIRING to contribute, by means of a common commercial policy, to the progressive
abolition of restrictions on international trade,*

*INTENDING to confirm the solidarity which binds Europe and the overseas countries
and desiring to ensure the development of their prosperity, in accordance with the
principles of the Charter of the United Nations,*

*RESOLVED by thus pooling their resources to preserve and strengthen peace and
liberty, and calling upon the other peoples of Europe who share their ideal to join in
their efforts,*

*HAVE DECIDED to create a European Economic Community...*

&gt; If the goal is now a Euro nation I think they better be a tad more clear on that so the UK can vote to leave.

Multi-speed Europe exists for a reason, but I highly doubt you have any idea what that concept entails and frankly I do not want to explain to someone so flippant.

&gt; Anyway, you can have the last word, euro debating is tedious and it seems like there is going to plenty of that in a year or two.

And the urge to waste a nice portion of my time at work, I have created a separate sub for Saints player profiles! With the special note that they'll be written by us - the fans, and so new fans can get our opinions on a player as well as their position and stats breakdown from a website somewhere.  

People's opinions of players, playstyles, and personalities are often lacking when someone wants to know about a player, so I thought we'd try and provide them. It also means a few of us can comment on a players' profile post and people can get differing opinions, or have discussion about why we're all wrong.  

There is obviously not much on the sub yet, and I haven't had a chance to look at CSS, but hopefully I'll get round to it at some point, and hopefully you guys will help with the content!  

In the hope that it can become a useful reference tool for new fans and old fans alike, I've put the link in the sidebar for now, but as I have no idea how it'll go, I can only assume that myself, or the other mods, can remove it after whole thing crashes and burns and I'm removed as a mod from /r/saintsfc for having such bad ideas.",null,0,null,1431622570,null,0,false,0,cr91ia8,null,t3_35yorb,null,t1_cr91ia8,null,t3_35yorb,null,null,null,1433061991,null,3,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,3,null

Well, I do think that is true to a certain extent, to be honest. There are no reason based arguments for faith, as faith is, by its very nature, conviction without proof. That said, I've no problem with a religious person presenting their ideas on their merits - I'm more concerned about what they don't present.

If you've experienced odd tasting water from kettles, we'd [love to hear from you](http://conversation.which.co.uk/energy-home/kettle-smelly-water-russell-hobbs/) so we can solve the mystery. Cheers!

Also, they make it clear a couple times in the show that War Doc did actually blow up Gallifrey and Time Lock it the ""first time"" around. That means that the on screen adventures of 9, 10 and 11 took place in a universe where it was destroyed. It was the burden of dealing with that fact that allowed him to grow into someone who could find another way. In the 50th, they changed their own history with the help of the moment and saved Gallifrey. Doing that broke the Time Lock (allowing them to reach Gallifrey in *Listen*) and caused the Doctor to spend a season trying to figure out who he really is now. The memory wipe just means that the stories leading up to the 50th would be basically the same now that their own history changed. 

Basically there’s the version of the universe we see in season 1-7: in this version Gallifrey is destroyed by War, 9 remembers watching it happen, the events are Time Locked and 11 is the last incarnation of the Doctor as he dies on Trenzalore and the Tardis gets huge. 

Then the 50th happens and the Moment reaches across time to grab versions of 10 and 11 from that universe. Together 10, 11, War and Clara decide to change the Doctor's own history and by extension rewrite the history of Gallifrey. This changes the universe to a new version in which Gallifrey is saved, 9 would not remember watching it happen but assume that it worked as War couldn't retain the memories of interacting with 10 and 11, the events are no longer Time Locked and now the Time Lords are around to overwrite what was supposed to happen on Trenzalore to give the Doctor more regenerations allowing 12 to exist.

These have been declining in the UK, the EU and the US since 2000 as a result of government increasingly Corporatist and Central Bank zero interest rate and QE policies.

The situation is rapidly getting worse not better.

The greatest recent period of improvement to living standards and general prosperity occurred during the 1950's and 1960's when income inequality greatly declined and ordinary people's wages improved.

Current government and Central Bank policy is still directed at wealth redistribution from the middle class to the very wealthy in the top 0.01% (and their cronies).

I advocate cutting the UK's military spending by 80% saving over £40bn a year, closing Corporate Tax loop holes, ending other forms of Corporate Welfare, ending the Neocon wars, fining the big banks £100bn plus for their multiple frauds and money laundering and using the money saved to raise the income tax threshold to around £30,000 (or having a wide band of a 10% tax rate) so that nobody pays tax (or next to nothing) until they earn enough for a decent standard of living.

The above is a first step to a sustainable recovery - this has more detail:- http://ian56.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/uk-perilously-close-to-triple-dip.html

For the book studies, I'd recommend memorising at least 5 quotes from each book, you don't need to memorise too many though as you'll get the book in the exam (we're the last year to get this), so don't stress it. I'm doing OMAM and LOTF, so for both books I've written out chapter summaries so I can quickly flick to a relevant chapter and pick out quotes. Do little character analysis' on each character, know each character well enough to write 30 marks about them, it sounds hard but the material available online really helps. You should also know the key themes, so for lord of the flies for example you should know about civilisation and barbarity, evil, etc. Again, online and especially CGP revision guides can REALLY help with this a ton.

For poetry, there's 2 sections, one should be on the poems you've studied in class and one should be on an ""unseen"" poem. Now I say ""unseen"" because in fact your teacher should have received a list of around 15 the unseen poetry can be picked from, so try and familiarise yourself with them all (I don't mean fully analyse them all, just have a read through and try spot key themes). For the ones you've analysed in class, annotate them and pick out language features and structural features used, again the CGP guides and sparknotes help massively with this. You should really know the poems you studied in class quite well by now, but if not you've still got a few days!

English Literature requires you to know a lot of information about texts, and you also need to learn the structure to write it with. Ask your teacher for help with this as most have their own way of writing it well, and try and do some practice questions as well as looking at some model answers for the A*s and As, this really helps a lot to see where others get their marks.

He runs in straight lines and is great to get behind people, we play against teams that mostly defend around their box and make us play in tight close positions rendering him useless in that environment. ""He scores goals"" have you seen him lately? He doesnt.  Griezman scores goals, the most in the La Liga in fact. Griezman has much better link up play and ball control than Bale and he wont cripple our freedom to spend in the future like Bale will. Not only that but Bale will mean the end of Willian and Cuadrado or possibly Oscar. If we need someone to attack from the right Griezmann can do it, what we need is a good dribbler that can cut into the box like Hazard does; Bale is not that type of player. he is a counter attack pace player that takes big touches and chases the ball. If hes in open space he will be effective (if he can manage to score at least) that is not given to us in the league as has been evident since the Sunderland draw. 

Griezmann will give us the option of another proven striker if he needs to be that, he can dribble well and control the ball in close spaces and has great link up play. His ability to create chances for himself and get shots of his one of his most desirable attributes and that is something we need. Griezmann is a better finisher than Bale and the most important thing about this is that our front 3 drift and switch where they play we dont have set in stone roles on the pitch which is what a team like Real madrid has with every player being given their portion of the pitch. Bale being permanently on the right wing will harm more players than is needed and given his current form I'd take Willian over him any day. We havent even given Cuadrado the chance to prove himself and he is a similar player to Bale...  He would be a big financial burden there is no guarantee that he would thrive in our team (one where everything is not setup for him to take the glory) and he would offer little flexibility for rotation which is what Griezmann would provide given his ability to play in multiple positions.",null,0,null,1431626760,null,0,false,0,cr944ng,null,t3_35wbgu,null,t1_cr944ng,null,t1_cr93sq8,null,null,null,1433063296,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

null,false,Close,null,null,null,"Dumb song. Dumb dumb dumb. Apologies for the long post, but it has frustrated me enough to type up a rant.

Point by point breakdown of the first minute of this rap before I gave up:

* **I was never taught how to get a job** - Schools almost always provide support in writing CV's, and usually even help to organise work experience.
* **I can remember disecting a frog**  - Disecting frogs fell out of fashion quite some time ago, and was banned in 2010, ~5 years before the song was uploaded.
* **I was never taught how to pay tax** - As most tax is paid through the PAYE and VAT systems it is pretty much done for you. If you need to pay other taxes you are contacted and told about them, so as long as the school teaches you how to read you are fine. Has anyone -really- had huge problems in working this out when they got out of school?
* **But I know loads about shakespears classics** - Point taken, this can seem dumb but it is all part of encouraging kids to read a diverse amount of materials (some of which is more challenging to understand). Reading is important, so you can read the letters which tell you to pay your taxes.
* **I was never taught to vote** - You literally register and turn up - has anyone really struggled with this? Plus there are billboards everywhere reminding people to register. I have never heard anyone complain that they don't know how to vote. Taking it in a less literal context, there are a lot of problems with being taught 'how to vote' - especially to do with who sets the curriculum (e.g. should the current government really be teaching kids what political decisions to make). There are citizenship classes that teach the fundamentals of the political system to kids, which seems like a good level to give them before they can work things out by themselves.
* **They spent that time defining isotopes** - Science education is very important, and giving kids a basic understanding of physics in school is something that Reddit of all places should encourage.
* **I wasn't taught to look after my health** - Almost all schools teach about food groups and the food pyramid, have PSHE classes that teach healthy eating, often have cookery classes that teach you how to cook healthy meals, cover sexual health in Biology and do sports to encourage kids to enjoy exercise. They teach kids not to smoke, and have banned it from the school yards, and at least try to warn them of the dangers of drugs and alcohol (although often they can be criticised for going too far).
* **But mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell** - As above, science education is important and allowing kids to sample the major areas will hopefully encourage more to do science in higher education, which is going to be important for the future of our country.
* **Never spent a lesson on current events** - Wait a second... you want to cover current events instead of Biology? Anyway, teach kids to read and enjoy learning instead of teaching them what happened today. Today's news is literally yesterday's news tomorrow - so you have to teach kids how to read and analyse information for when they leave school instead of just giving them the information about what is happening right now.
* **Instead I studied the old american west** - Ok, this is dumb but it is only covered if you decide to do a GCSE in History which suggests you are at least somewhat interested in History compared to other subjects. Many people get joy in understanding how the world got to be as it is.
* **I was never taught what laws there are (x 3)** - I bet you knew what laws there were by the end of school though. The major aspects are usually taught throughout school, at a minimum in PSHE classes and citizenship classes. Again, if you teach a kid how to read and research they can find out anything they need to.
* **I don't know squat about trading and stocks. Or where my money goes, or where does it come from. How does the thing that motivates the earth function?** - Teaching kids how to trade stocks - really? How are we going to teach kids to beat the market when they have the efficient market hypothesis working against them. As for the second part (economics) it is taught at A-level, but it is complex compared to other subjects at this level of education, and if we did teach kids it I can imagine it would be another lyric in this faffing song. *""I got taught supply and demand, but I was never taught how to hold a girls hand. I was never taught fiscal policy, but now i'm getting blind and they didn't teach me optometry.""*

I dont know that Cuadrado will come good (i hope he does), if Oscar continues with this run of play we may be stuck with Willian at no10 and leaving a 50/50 cuadrado on the RW. I dont know how many times I have to say this but our attacking 3 do not have set in stone roles do you watch them play? They drift they change sides, Oscar found himself on the left wing on the overlap with Hazard early on in the season. Griezmann can play at no10.He has the dribbling skills, link up play and ability to shoot that will make him dangerous around the penalty area. the whole point of our RW dilemma is that nobody seems to be able to create from that side mainly because no runs ever get made into the box. He is capable of playing on the right from the penalty area. Willian doesnt even act as a RWer he is always drifting inwards and Ivanovic is there for the overlap to cross. how many times have you seen Willian run into the box and get an assist? It is Ivanovic that does it, our RB. If we want someone comfortable on the right wing then move ivanovic there and buy a new defender he is essentially this black white right winger that you think a player has to be. All we need in Griezmann is the ability to dribble past players, to link up and assist around the box and the ability to score. He is capable of playing on the right wing and certainly in our system where the ""Right winger"" is not even a set in stone right sided player. I've seen him at Atletico when they sit back in big matches he is left up top to go wherever the ball goes in order to keep the ball and attack, yes that includes drifting to the right.

What? Just no. I can't even accurately formulate an argument right now because that part is just so blatantly wrong and ill informed. 

""Through the centuries, English people have been deprived to have their own piece of soil because the most of it has been owned by aristocrats, the English people have been deprived of doing business - aristocrats held shares of the East Indian trading company. The English people with pleasure ran from the native land to America. The Protestantism was a form of a national protest against the power of aristocrats. The English Royal Family is special subculture formed by foreigners to suppress an ordinary Englishman. England, revolt! God save the queen!""

Also not accurate of the opinions of the British people or factually correct.

""It is clear that popularity of French language decreased due to the great French revolution.""

Evidence? 

""French language had been used in the British jurisprudence for centuries, later the use of English as court language became common only in the 18th century. Back then, it had been something normal, when you came to court and saw the judges speaking in a French dialect.""

Not true. Judges spoke in English but occasionally used French legal terms. Most legal terms are actually Latin, but hey-ho. 

I have to say overall it's an admirable effort, and you are indeed tackling a very difficult subject indeed. However, this essay is full of hear-say and a lot of historical inaccuracies. You often state stereotypes as fact and claim that some of your postulations as gospel when in fact they are factually incorrect. If you wrote this essay souly for the purpose of analysing England then it is probably quite poor, but if you are doing so to work on your English language skills then there are good elements. You have a good vocabulary and write well. There are some pretty obvious grammar mistakes and it is formatted rather poorly but it is good for somebody who is speaking English as a second language.

Ahahahhahahaaaa best laugh I've had all day. Unless you mean the effort they put into lining their own pockets. Employing family members and fiddling expenses to line their own pockets.
 
&gt;or fight against each other to make important decisions. 

MPs do not fight, they all toe the line. MPs who do not toe the line are extra greedy. If you remember the Blair regime MPs would vote how Blair told them to vote. You saw this at many votes where the chamber was mostly empty during debates. Mps would go in vote for what Blair told them to vote. It's essentially a dictatorship. MPs themselves are bribed to vote with promotions. 

Then you get greedy MPs (greedier than normal MPs who suffer from extreme avarice) who go against the government. In reality they are holding out for bigger bribes. Like tax payer funded all expense paid 'fact finding missions' to somewhere hot with nice beaches.

&gt;Teach about how this is important so that the right decisions are made. 

As above MPs vote how their leaders tell them to vote. MPs are by and large men and women of straw they have no integrity and the way votes and decisions are made are via brown envelopes and corruption.

It's basically handing the property to the lender, this would save on the court fees incurred in the usual repossession process. The lender would then market the property for sale. I'm also under the impression bankruptcy relates to unsecured debt such as credit cards rather than secured, such as mortgages, but if the lender had possession of the property they would then deal with the official receiver if and when necessary. I can't say this as fact, but I really think it's worth you having a chat with your mortgage provider. 

EDIT: Of course you would need to find somewhere else to live before handing the property back, but once it is empty it's a really quick process with the lender I work with, I would hope the process is similar across the board.

You make valid points. As I pointed out in conversation to another redditor, he does go in to more detail in his other videos. Ultimately I agree with both of you, I get what he is going for but a lot of the points in the song are shallow or contradictory. I think the main point is, a lot of the stuff he mentions is actually found in the curriculum but it's not given enough focus.

The Tory government is nothing to do with London, which is the most left wing region in the UK outside of Scotland.

I agree that cities outside of London need more investment but it should also be acknowledged that London's high spending is partly because of the outsize revenue it generates (both from transport fares and taxes). London's been in a positive feedback loop for decades since Thatcher rebalanced the economy away from manufacturing and towards finance in the 80's. Something that accelerated once we had a directly elected mayor.

The national government (not elected by London!) should be using taxation revenue to invest in Northern cities. It seems that this message is finally getting through since the financial crash and even Osbourne is talking up investing in Northern cities.

before I get shot down, I'll explain some of my decisions. Icardi has had a hell of a season at Inter Milan, but they as a team have underachieved again. He'd be perfect for us in my opinion. 

Van Der Wiel seems like the obvious target for right back in my opinion. His stint at PSG hasn't worked out because Serge Aurier became flavour of Summer 2014, wouldn't be too expensive, he's in his prime and he's fairly experienced.

Martinez &amp; Kramer/Camacho are all young and proven powerhouses. I'm sure they would cost a lot of money, but could walk straight into our first team from what I've seen.

As I've said about 1000 times in the sub, Firmino should be our highest priority this summer. He's pretty much the complete package and he's only going to get better with age. He and Coutinho would have an absolute field day providing for Icardi ahead of them. Sterling would obviously in this hypothetical situation be at another club or on the bench, I don't believe he's indispensable, which is why I've not included him.

There is an old case in which Exxon tried to claim copyright in their name and failed, but the reasoning of that case may no longer apply now certain aspects of copyright have been harmonised in the EU. However, you'd need a fairly creative name to claim copyright over it. I suspect that copyright isn't the issue here.

If it was: the fact that you got there first ought to demonstrate conclusively that you didn't copy it from them and hence aren't infringing any rights they might have.

So, forget copyright. ""Trademark"" is what they have mentioned. Trade marks have to be registered (there is another kind of liability for copying the name of a business in certain circumstances called ""passing off"" but my guess is that won't be any more likely than a trade mark - but you never know). So you could check to see what mark they have registered.

For sure? Sorry, but when people start saying things are 'for sure' with no evidence presented, my BS detector starts tingling.

&gt;there's some truth in the idea that if a police officer makes it to trial there must be some very damning evidence indeed against them.

Hmm. There are plenty of examples of police officers being found not guilty at a trial so clearly there can't always be 'damning evidence' presented. It would be an interesting statistical analysis to see  how the number of police officers found guilty/not guilty compared with general statistics from equivalent charges (corruption, fraud,  assault etc) from across the criminal justice system. I don't know if the statistics are available though.

&gt;the police culture of sticking together

It's undeniable that this happens. However, it also happens in families, communities, neighbourhoods, trade unions etc . Its hardly just a police culture for there to be a reluctance to testify against people you think you have something in common with.

&gt;aggressively defended where there is clear evidence.

Surely everyone is entitled to a robust defence despite what the evidence is. I'm suprised I need to be reminding you of that.

it is growing because of immigration - are you disputing that fact?

no it probably wont - but it is happening right now, and people are frustrated with the lack of houses and their relative expense right now. there are no projections that I am aware of that says that it will stop growing anytime soon. 

&gt; Fertility rate in the UK is only 1.9, by the way

yes... hence the growth is fuelled by immigration - are you sure you have a handle on this stuff?

&gt;  The fact is that jobs are heavily compressed geographically and the only 2 ways out of that are either better mass transit or high-rise apartments. 

a totally black &amp; white analysis, defeatist in nature. clearly it is perfectly possible to slowly rebalance jobs around the country, and the northern cities in the most part are thriving. clearly there are a gazillion different ways to build without resorting to high-rises. 

you seem to be under the impression that there is no population growth, people only need houses because they are moving out of home, and the only place anyone would productively live is the south east. you are wrong on every point.

When they do, it's because the evidence is truly overwhelming or the police establishment itself is telling them to.  We still have not a single conviction of a police officer for a death in custody since 1969, and even back that long ago they could only manage a few months inside for assault.

Gove is a competent and loyal minister who can handle difficult policy battles. He's clearly a good choice given Cameron wants to replace the HRA with a British Bill of Rights.

The fact you disagree with his views and don't like him doesn't signify a poor appointment, just that you disagree with his views and don't like him.

Similarly with Gummer and Patel. Their views don't make them in any way unsuitable for their role, they just make them people *you* wouldn't appoint.

As for Whittingdale, you are quite simply wrong to say he hates the BBC. He has praised the BBC for much of what it does and defends it's importance and value as a public service broadcaster. But he also has a fairly well-reasoned view (which I don't necessarily share) that the BBC goes too far beyond the public service role and represents unfair competition for other broadcasters. He also believes the licence fee is outdated. Both of these views developed during his long and well-respected chairmanship of the cross-party parliamentary committee on culture and media.

Fan of Atlético here.

Reason he is leaving is due to a contractual dispute with Atlético.. his father (his agent) wanted a sum (wages) which Nathan is simply not worth yet.. But bc of his potential other teams were there to pay him. Atletico weren't playing him as often as his father would like and he took us to court to get Nathan out of his contract (three yrs left), which he lost.. Chelsea are acting as 'agents' in this case, he's not going to be playing for Chelsea anytime soon.. it's a way to get around the contract he's in as well as the '3rd party' ownership ban.. he's not any where near ready for europe let alone Chelsea. He was not a regular starter for us and very often played pretty poorly, but he is only 19 yrs old. Also he needs to stay in brazil or his fee goes up drastically as per his contract with Atletico. It's quite a detailed and kinda complicated issue.

For a bit more detail, basically Nathan played well in a few tournaments for the younger Brazilian national team (sub 17 and sub 20). His 'value' went up so his agent (father) wanted Atletico to pay up. Other clubs showed interest so they were using that to negotiate a new contract with Atletico. Atletico and their president are known for being very very hard negotiators and once our president believes in something it is very very difficult to change his mind. He's very cocky and very stubborn. But in this case he has a very solid point. The issue was that Nathan has yet to play well for Atletico. Out of probably about 30 or so games for us he has played well in about 3-5 of them. He shows a lot of promise in certain aspects but he's simply not good enough yet. Again, this kid is only 19 years old so that doesn't mean he won't be great. His father pretty much wanted big time contract for him or else he would take him elsewhere. I believe he had 3 years on his current contract which Atletico were very happy with just running it out or running it for at least another year before selling him. Well his father realized there was a clause in the contract that for $2 million the contract could get bought out so that's just what he did. He came up with 2 million with some investers.. BUT he was stupid and didn't realize that the 2 million is only is he were to go to another team within Brazil. For him to get sold to Europe the clause was $30 million. Nathan's father took him too court and lost. Atletico had the right to keep Nathan against his will, which knowing our president I thought he was going to do just that. But that's when Chelsea came in and helped become an ""agent"" of sort. Not sure what Chelsea's play is in all of this but I guarantee you Nathan will be loaned back out to a club in Brazil. What's kinda ironic is that the best club for him to be loaned out to is probably Atletico PR this year. We have a very weak team and he would have gotten a lot of minutes this yr in his preferred role. If he gets loaned out to one of Brazil's 'big' teams, he's gonna have just as much trouble getting into the game as he did was us the last two years, when we were pretty good.",null,0,null,1431635724,null,0,false,0,cr99t6o,null,t3_35yi83,null,t1_cr99t6o,null,t3_35yi83,null,null,null,1433065974,null,14,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,14,null

- Council Tax varies widely across the country. Check your local district council website to see exactly how much you'll have to pay.

- Food will also depend on where you shop. If you want to use Aldi or Lidl, a weekly shop will be considerably less expensive but food *will* eat into your budget.

- Utility bills can be horrific - again it'll depend on whether you want high-speed broadband, cable TV, whether you are a trigger-happy user of central heating and how often you shower.

- Transport depends on where you are and how often you travel. Are you talking about commuting to work daily by car or the occasional train journey at weekends?

You want to take into account:

Rent
Council Tax
Gas/Electric
Water

The council tax and rent you can find out about and know exactly. Energy and water is a bit more tricky and varies by the size of the property and how well insulated it is and the type of heating.

We live in a two bed new build flat and pay about £57 per month for gas/electric and about £24 for water.

But when I was a student I lived in a big Victorian town house that came to around £200 per month in the winter for energy but around the same for water.

Now that's not an excuse for not investing in infrastructure elsewhere - it's not a zero-sum game and shouldn't be framed as such - but to say that London shouldn't see infrastructure investment just because trains in Manchester or Liverpool or Leeds are old is ridiculous.

In reply to some comment of mine he said,

 ""you don't think those members of parliament get into government to look after YOUR interests do you? Quite the opposite, they're there to further their own interests.""

I was very cynical about a lot of Jim's views but this remark gave me a new perspective and became responsible for a whole new way of thinking that swept away my naivety.  Once I accepted the possibilities of  the corruptive nature of the system, puzzling political events began to make sense.   I abandoned all feelings of personal responsibility for politics.

I wasn't directly blaming the government for these things, but these are in my opinion things the government should be tackling if they wish for business to flourish. The turnover is around about the threshold, but basically requires 3-4 full time staff for the business to run, thereby eating up most of the profit right there, not including the £21000 a year rent, which in my understanding is pretty typical, the £4200 a year electricity, the £20000 or so paid for VAT, and so on. 

The council obviously doesn't set the rates, but in this particular area (which is probably one of the cheapest areas to set up this kind of business in the UK) they charge electricity for everyone in the market stall and divide it between the people. Not strictly legal if my understanding is correct, but this is what is happening.

I'm going back down to my local station this weekend and will request all the notes from their file (namely the part that says there was no records of my car speeding on the ANPR cameras, or the PNC). The we I mentioned was my parents and myself. As we will struggle to afford a solicitor, we're trying to get as much of the paperwork and legwork done ourselves so any time we do have to pay for a solicitor for is limited. They couldn't be guilty of the offence since they don't drive my car whatsoever.

I understand that - the reason I didn't fill out the form initially was that I either had to admit liability or nominate someone who was driving at the time. Since I wasn't driving, and nobody else *could* have been driving (I leave the keys in my room, with the door to my room locked while I sleep), this was impossible. Once again, it was only my naivety that stopped me from calling the police force back once my local police had closed their investigation. Side note on this part: I spoke to a man at the courthouse who said that this kind of offence will typically only go to court so far as the actual driver of the car is found, then the police drop the charges of the failing to nominate a driver, and the fine is dealt with outside of court.

I'm not worried about the road traffic incident so far as I'm worried about the failing to comply with a police notice. I'm aiming to go into InfoSec, and as said [here](http://www.phoenixts.com/blog/how-to-become-a-licensed-penetration-tester-lpt/); ""Documentation must also be provided stating that an investigative agency performed a criminal background check and findings revealed no prior criminal history. Applicants may also sign a Declaration of No Criminal Convictions if they are unable to provide the background documentation; in order to sign this declaration, candidates must make a request in writing to certmanager@eccouncil.org."" - would this count as a criminal conviction?
