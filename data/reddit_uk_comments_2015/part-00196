&gt;Aquilani cost €20 million plus extras.

LFC paid exactly [£4,250,977.72](https://sites.google.com/site/liverpoolview/the-cost-of-alberto-aquilani) to Roma for Aquilani - the first installment. That's it. 

As for Paletta, we received loan fees for three seasons before a final sale price. We made approximately £1.5m for him. Incidentally, Paletta played for Italy against England in last year's World Cup.

&gt; He spent £230,000,000 and sold approximately £162,000,000. 

You forgot to add in Alonso's second  £15m installment form Madrid, £50m for Torres, £30 for Masch and many others. His entire team was sold off at enormous profit.

&gt;Leonardo

Left Inter after seven months, and the team continued to decline to this day.

Rafa could've won the League for us. Instead, 2007 was the last time he received money from the club/ H&amp;G. After that, he had to sell to buy. His team declined after finishing 2nd in 2008/09 because he did not have money to spend. Even money he generated from players sales are used to pay H&amp;G's debt. Further, the £230m attributed to him is flawed, because (i) when he sold to buy, the figures are essentially booked twice (ii) some players, like Johnson, we only paid £7m instead of the published £16m.

A lot of people make a lot of effort to support the club, and after the last four years you can't blame them for voting with their feet.

Even if they recruit well, I don't know how easy it is to incubate team spirit, familiarity, tactics etc in a short space of time. I can picture decent effort on the pitch from honest pros signed with good intentions, regularly losing matches on individual moments of communications breakdown, or pure cohesion of opposition play.

If QPR's professional reputation in the industry is going to be rebuilt then they will have to sail away from the scum who lumbered us with so many players that made us appreciate the likes of Hill, Faurlin and Mackie even more. They need to recruit from different talent pools entirely, and there is of course a question mark over how much experience they have in this area.

I can't find any indication of what kind of tactical record Ramsey has outside of QPR. His Charleston battery squad won a championship in 2003, but there doesn't seem to be a lot documented.

Well, no, unless you have two world class strikers in the form of their lives. 

""Defending is easy."" Sure, all you have to do is NOT make any mistakes. Which, in practice is the hardest thing to do in ~~soccer~~ life. Great managers can do it though. (That shifty little fucker who coaches Chelsea is the best current example, I'm afraid.) Rodgers can't. 

I would be curious what Rafa could do with supportive owners. Also, I strongly suspect both Klopp and Ancelotti would have won the league last season with that team.

When we have these megathreads, people don't post the rumours and those that do get posted get buried under the innocuous comments so are hard to find.

Given there is nothing else going on other than transfer rumours and shitposts, I don't think having bad rumours on the rubreddit is a bad thing.

Ok, let's go:

Link 1 I assume relates to question 10, ""Would you support or oppose there being areas of Britain which are pre-dominantly Muslim and in which Sharia law is introduced?"".

That is slightly different from that they want the law to be introduced in the UK. It could be as encompassing as they'd like it to be fully implemented or partially implemented on a case-by-case basis, which I would welcome. Example being inheritance, which a Canadian court has successfully used. 

Link 2: ""feelings and motives"" are rather inadequate identifiers. It is boundary less. I can sympathise with why they felt the need to do it. Does that mean I support it? No. The question, I feel was somewhat inflammatory, because it doesn't seek judgement on the thing as a whole.

Link 3: I haven't finished reading it, however, it's concentrating on immigrants ... how about a study which doesn't focus on immigrants, would the results be the same or not?

Link 4: Again this relates to the meaning of free speech. Like a lot of people, I think there's a limit to freedom of speech. I mean, does freedom of speech relinquish or absolve me of any criminal or civil proceedings in which I spew out hate crime, or incite hatred or something?

In testing academic references, one has to be careful to actually use the raw data, and something that is resolved from bias or deficiencies. Sourcing this data itself has problems, how does one confirm that the questioning person is sufficiently identified to fit the criteria of the study? There's nothing from stopping me claiming to be Christian and answering questions, thus introducing misappropriations into the data. It's an unfortunate thing which I don't know how to account for when reading the data, that is, assuming the data returned is in raw format.

Something which is unlikely to happen anyway because it would require the invasion of both Iraq and Syria to be successful, and it is unlikely that Russia will allow al-Assad to be overthrown (as would be inevitable in that situation.)

It's been rumoured that there are boots on the ground in Iraq already, in the form of special forces, though it's unconfirmed by the Ministry of Defence. So, again, ""boots on the ground"" means something very specific.

The current consensus is to provide the Iraqi army, Kurdish Protection Units, and Shia militias with equipment to fight whilst providing air support. When this ultimately proves to be a non-option, the Allies will turn back to trying to persuade an Arab coalition to deal with the problem.

Phillips are a major firm, but I don't get why there was so much hate for them in late 2004-early 2005.

The Government are very wrong about their definition of trolling; this is organized harassment, or cyber-harassment, really, not trolling. They do not understand the difference between the two.

Trolls incite arguments or post logic puzzles for ""fun"", organized harassers do far worse, and this is what Twitter/Facebook ""trolls"" technically are - organized harassment via social media.

A decent proportion of people who want to try other drugs already will, but availability and ultimately social acceptance will make use more prominent. 

People often drink when they are upset about relationships, often with less than pretty results. Imagine instead that people turn to MDMA, something which was originally proposed for marriage counselling, there won't be any violence but there will probably be a lot of hugs. 

At the moment there are no legal alternatives and most people, understandably don't want to break the law. Many people also believe that class a drugs are banned because they are super dangerous when many of them are actually very safe. 

&gt; It's the most effective social lubricant out there

That depends on your measurement really. Yes many people enjoy it but a large proportion of street violence, domestic violence, sexual assaults, traffic accidents are linked to alcohol.

This is unlikely to go away quickly and certainly isn't going to be solved by the Conservatives. The Human Rights Act does, however, do quite well in raising the issues of human rights. Ministers are required to make a 'statement of compatibility' (or incompatibility) each time they introduce legislation. All public bodies have a more specific list of things that they have to respect. There is now a Parliamentary Committee that deals specifically with human rights issues. Judges have the power to actually assess how *good* a piece of legislation is, have a strong power to 'interpret' to make it better, and then an explicit power to publicly shame the government into fixing it (which has happened 19/20 times). Ministers are given a controlled power to amend legislation to be within the ECHR faster than with normal legislation (only used 3/19 times, however).

I'm not depressed, I'm sitting in my pants on reddit and even had garlic bread for breakfast. If that ain't the formula for a happy bank holiday then I don't know what is! 

My comment was a joke, don't take it too seriously. 

While I wouldn't say I wake up and the thought of making coffee all day brings the joys of life to me, I actually don't mind my job! Besides my job is a means to an end - it's paying for bigger and better things so I am ""making effort to improve my life"" as you put it.

&gt;That's not what I said, is it. I'm saying that maybe people should put more effort in to improving their lifes and less effort making paying customers feel guilty that they are forced to be polite,

Saw that on another comment, and I certainly didn't even suggest anything close to that. 

I'm not forced to be polite, I am polite to the customer because it's the correct thing to do, not the general customers fault working in the catering industry is (on the whole) poop! The customer pays my wage, they simply want a drink and a bite to eat - why would I want to ruin that for them? Hence me saying I'll put on a nice fancy smile and act happy so they can enjoy their time. Frankly if a customer left feeling guilty I would feel terrible. 

&gt;Moan about your job, that's fine, we all do from time to time, play the sob story because you have to pretend to like it? Not my problem.

Then first focus on building an emergency fund (most recommend 3-6 months of minimal expenses, depending on your risk preference), then anything after that should be saved. Putting it into a pension is a good method of saving, but you should understand how your pension works.

Injuries have played a factor, and for me that is a part of the grading of a signing. Many players get the benefit of the doubt with injuries, but they play a part of the overall makeup of a player at the end of the day, especially if they are injury prone.

null,false,DukePPUk,null,null,null,"It's slightly complicated because the ECtHR can't actually overrule the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court rules on matters of UK law (other than Scottish criminal cases and a few other random areas over which it doesn't have jurisdiction). In the context of human rights the Court decides whether actions of a public authority are legal as defined by the Human Rights Act, or if an Act of Parliament is compatible with the rights set out in the HRA.

The ECtHR acts in the context of a treaty (or series of treaties). They decide whether a party to the treaty (a government) has broken it.

So the ECtHR rules on what the European Convention on Human Rights says or means. The Supreme Court applies relevant UK law to UK cases. If the case involves human rights issues, the Supreme Court may need to apply bits of the ECHR itself but only those bits listed in the HRA, and only because the HRA says so, and it interprets it within the context of the relevant UK law, and doesn't have to follow the ECtHR.

Neither court can overrule the other as - while they are applying the same starting words in similar contexts - they work in distinct legal systems. They don't even apply the same rights (not all the rights in the ECHR are covered by the HRA). Most of the time the courts will agree, but if they don't agree, then people in the UK have to follow the Supreme Court's version for them to be acting lawfully within UK law.

null,false,Eddie_Hitler,null,null,null,"&gt; What am I realistically striving for I the UK? Buying a house is unaffordable, and even if I could save up enough for a deposit, it would probably only be enough to afford a cramped little flat in a bad area.

I'm 28 next month and, to be honest, the whole reason I'm saving money is for buying a house.  Currently have £27k saved - it's taken me a whole lifetime of other inheritances and savings to get there - and I'm still quite a few years off even in the somewhat cheap area I currently live in.  I have quite a bit more money saved and earn more than a few of my peers and they're living better lives than me (more sociable, more holidays etc.).  So where is their money going?  They can't be flush.

London?  Well, that could be another 10 years before I can have a two bed flat in Zone 3.  You can get a one-bed flat in London Bridge for £700k - around here that would get you a 5 bed detached house with two large gardens and double garage... on a private road.

&gt; It's sad that independent living is becoming impossible for young people. 

Indeed.  Living on your own in London is basically impossible and almost literally everyone, young and old, is in some kind of house share even if they own and are paying a mortgage.  Young graduates move to London and rent some Zone 2 room for £700 a month in a house with three other people; this is considered normal and goes without being questioned.

In the rare event that they do question or moan about the cost of living, they just say ""Oh I wish I didn't have to live in Clapham!""  Well, you don't.  Suggest that to them and it's like the ""this goes to 11"" scene from This Is Spinal Tap.

Unless you bought your London home prior to 2004 it ain't happening now unless you strike oil, get an inheritance, or if you're a girl.

&gt; Buying a house is out of the question, and renting usually means getting initially shafted by letting agencies and then getting continuously fucked by rising rents and low-quality housing because it's cheaper for landlords. 

Luckily, my rent hasn't moved in the nearly three years I've been in this place.  ""This place"", however, is in crap condition - it needs redecorated and a lot of things are broken in some way.  The redecoration (including repairing year-old flood damage \o/) won't happen while I'm still living here and, despite the letting agent being great, the landlord always has some bullshit excuse over why things can't be fixed.

The best one was the washing machine which died spectacularly.  I could overnight a new one from Currys for just £300, landlord blubs ""I can't afford it"" blah blah blah despite me paying £600 in rent each month... **five weeks** to get a new machine.

Including letting agent fees, rent, and household bills I've racked up over £20k.  That's far too much money to have no freedom over maintenance or gain use of an asset that isn't yours.

&gt; The real problem is this whole buy-to-let culture. 

A family friend of mine (aged 32 or so?) recently quit a somewhat lucrative Big 4 job to start his own business.  What's his ""business""?  Buying up property (with the help of his wealthy and somewhat important father) and rent it out.  I was absolutely incensed when I found out, because it's that sort of nonsense which is putting bumps in the road when it comes to me buying my own place.

Buy-to-let has got so far out of control and the housing market in this country is *so* broken, that I genuinely believe this will be the next ""big ticket"" item in future election campaigns (right now the ""big ticket"" is immigration).  It's a ticking bomb and we are going to see more and more youngsters growing up completely screwed, disenfranchised, and heading to the polls.  Given that we've only had runaway house prices since 1998 (so not that long really) and the boomers will eventually die off, I have some hope of a decent house price correction in the future.

Exact same scenario as the woman writing this article. The interview went exactly the same. They invited me for a second interview to ""go meet clients"" which ended up being door to door knocking. They didn't explain where we were going as they loaded us in the car, driving an hour away and dropping is off in the middle of a council estate in a city I had never been too.

Beauty of it was that they refused to take me back and I had to make my own way home. The office was an hour train journey from my home town to begin with so I had to find my way home with extreme difficulty, upset and in an area that wasn't that safe on an extremely cold winter morning in barely warm clothes (as we were told we would be meeting clients, not door to door canvasing, dressed smart interview clothes not walking clothes) Took me an hour to find the train station and getting home wasted another 3.

On the journey they started to describe the business. Major charities get them to knock and canvas for money, they gain a small commission (a shocking amount truthfully, over half the donation), they do it for a month, get sponsored by their boss and open their own branch and do the same to their underlings. A true pyramid scheme that none of the other hopefuls I was with could see through, none of this explained during the initial interview; as far as I know I was promised a basic customer service advisor interview.

this happened two years ago. I was promised a customer service advisor role and they scammed me out of my time and money (the train journey wasn't cheap).

Tonight, the heroes of Istanbul will gather on the banks of the Mersey to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Liverpool’s Champions League victory over AC Milan. Their successors in red shirts will be jetting off to Dubai for a post-season break. It’s just as well. Yesterday’s defeat by Stoke City makes tonight’s celebrations an embarrassing sideshow to the chaos at Anfield.

History at least provides some solace for Liverpool fans. The future looks increasingly desperate.

Brendan Rodgers will take most of the blame for the shambolic end to the season, but the Liverpool manager is a symptom of a wider malaise at the club. Last week, Gary Neville claimed that Anfield needed a “visionary” to revive the place. The arch-enemy of Scousers identified the problem but got things the wrong way round. There are too many people at and around Liverpool who believe they are visionaries. The end result is you don’t need to be a prophet to see that urgent action is necessary if the club are to compete at the highest level.

Rodgers was given the job three years ago during what amounted to a revolution at Anfield. Kenny Dalglish was shown the door after winning a trophy and since his departure, many of the people who were steeped in the ways of the club have left. They have been replaced by “ideas” men with computer programmes rather than football knowledge. They reinvented the approach to player recruitment in order to find “value”. On the evidence of much of the season, they’ve merely located duds.

The emphasis is on youth and versatility. The markets they shop in are abroad. Rodgers, if given the chequebook, would probably look closer to home at players who are more seasoned. The conflict of opinions has meant that no one is quite happy with the state of affairs.

In the early part of the season, the manager was reluctant to play some of the squad. Some had arrived despite Rodgers’s misgivings. He was encouraged to get them in the team by Fenway Sports Group, the owner. “Encouraged” is probably the wrong word. It was made clear that this was what was expected of him. His job was on the line.

For a while, it worked. It took some creative tactical thinking but it was always destined to fail. Emre Can, for example, is not a centre back. Nor a full back. It is hard to see him playing in the midfield at Premier League pace. The German is the poster boy for the “versatility” theory. He has not proved good enough in any position, whatever the computer programmes tell the transfer committee.

Fenway Sports Group (FSG) is in a hurry. It wants Champions League participation and success. It is not a bad group of owners. FSG is not taking money out of the club. It knows that winning things will make a future sale — not imminent but not too far over the horizon — much more lucrative. Mike Gordon, the second biggest investor in FSG, has been very active in the second half of the season, acting almost as a de facto director of football. If that role is to exist, it may need someone with significantly more experience.

All this throws up big questions for the end-of-season review in Boston. Is Rodgers the man to take Liverpool forward? Can he do it with the existing strategy? Is the recruitment policy paying off? If a new manager is needed, who would take the job? Would a top-class coach be happy for the transfer committee to provide him with players?

It is hard to escape the feeling that the visionaries — from Rodgers with his dossier, catchphrases and smugness to Mike Edwards and his number-crunching on the transfer committee — have convinced the owner they are brighter than the rest of the football world. They are not. The brave new world is not working.

What’s the answer? A sharp, competent chief executive would help. A director of football might provide a place for the buck to stop — the finger-pointing game of who signed whom might even end.

There are too many people without proven track records at Anfield — including the manager — acting as though they’ve found the golden shortcut. They haven’t.

There is an overdose of vision at Anfield, much of it conflicting. It is making the Champions League and trophies look increasingly like a mirage for Liverpool.",null,0,null,1432566901,null,0,false,0,crkbh3r,null,t3_377l0g,null,t1_crkbh3r,null,t3_377l0g,null,null,null,1433256880,null,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10,null

Thanks all.

I'm certainly unhappy about being proven right. I was very bitter at how everyone reacted but even more pissed off at the club for putting us in this position.

What worries me greatly is that I'm just an idiot living in Beirut with no football experience bar watching the game for the last 30 years or so. These people are supposed to be professionals.

If from my couch an amateur like me could see how badly we'd fucked up in the Summer, how could these idiots not? How in the hell could they put an entire season at the mercy of an injury prone player's fitness? How could they spend so much money on a defender without doing their homework? How could they replace the most hyperactive sportsman in the world with the slowest player in Liverpool history and the laziest striker we've ever had?

I said in the Summer that I wanted Brendan to come out and downplay expectations. He didn't. I think that was a massive mistake on his part. Too many people had their heads in the sand, too many were still on a high from the euphoria of last season (witness the anfield wrap going on about not taking 84 points all Summer). That left Brendan very much isolated and in danger, because a lot of people genuinely expected us to have a season like we did last year.

There needed to be more talk in the Summer of the challenges ahead, more downplaying of expectations and the club should have been very clear, from the outset, that Brendan would be safe whatever happened. I think he made a lot of mistakes this year based on his fear or losing his job (for Brendan to play old teams, defensive teams and slow teams, trying to grind out results... that is in complete contrast with who he is as a manager just like Houllier playing a gung ho style would be for him).

The saddest thing for me is that this season did not get me down. Part of it is because last season caused me so much pain, I think anything else football related will always pale in comparison. I'm still not over last season (just like the players, visibly).

Part of it is I saw all of it coming, and thus was no shocked or disappointed when it did. The anger people felt during this season, I felt when I saw us fuck up in the Summer. By the time we lost to Villa, I made my peace with this season.

&gt; Here are some of the rights infringements that the HRA has prevented in the UK:

&gt; * Requiring that when somebody is killed by the state there must be a proper independent investigation, and that armed personnel should be trained properly (McCann et al v UK)

&gt; * Preventing the government informing paramilitaries they know will kill someone of that individual's location, to execute by proxy (Shaghan v UK)
You can't put an ethnic individual in a cell with a racist offender and take bets on how long he'll last (he died) (R on the application of Amin v SSHD)

&gt; * It led to safeguards and legal standards for wiretapping (Malone v UK) (Although it would appear not nearly enough...)

&gt; * You can't ""interrogate"" prisoners by forcing them into certain positions or depriving them of light and sound (Ireland v UK)

&gt; * The legalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (Dudgeon v UK)

&gt; * Stopping contempt of court from infringing on freedom of the press (Sunday Times v UK)

&gt; * The mentally ill who voluntarily commit themselves to an institution are owed the same duty - suicide watch etc - as those who are sectioned (Rabone v Pennine Care)

&gt; * Ensuring that existing prisoners still get access to solicitors (Golder v UK)

&gt; * Ensuring that workers maintain rights to join trade unions (Wilson v UK)

&gt; * Giving the police an obligation to act if somebody is being dangerously stalked (Osman v UK)

&gt; * Preventing indefinite detention under the declaration of a national emergency (A v SOS for the Home Dept).

&gt; * Preventing public birching of children by the police in the Isle of Man (Tyrer v UK)

&gt; * If you're arrested and acquitted, the government cannot arbitrarily hold onto your DNA, which could never have been obtained were you not wrongly accused (S &amp;amp; Marper vs UK)

&gt; In **every single instance here** the British government claimed it was doing nothing wrong and defended its actions.

I personally think Moreno was a good signing so we'll be generous and say 6/24 or 25% have been successful. I'm excluding Allen from the success group because I don't think his production versus his fee qualifies him.

That is overall a woeful return. If we take the Paul Tomkins view that a 50% success rate in the transfer market is a good figure to be around, we're performing about half as well as we should be. Whether it's BR's fault or the committee's has been discussed to death but looking at it in raw terms, whoever is responsible for this should lose their job this summer. 

I also don't like the low fees in the ""Out"" bracket. Adam, Downing and Shelvey should all have gone for more money than they did given how inflated the market has become. We're wasting money on the Ins and on the Outs, Suarez excepted. 

I maintain, and have for a long time, that we desperately need to be looking outside of England for buys. In terms of value for money Coutinho and Sakho are among our best buys and look where they came from: Italy and France respectively.

Europa, I'm not really bothered.

in the league I think Rodgers has done an above-average job. the 2nd-place season was probably the best single season per dollar of any team in the past 5-10 years at the PL level. we spend so much less than United/City/Chelsea and less than Arsenal and to play at that high of level is a huge plus for Rodgers. yes, we had Suarez but we used him right and got people around him to play well. one player alone doesn't get your team so many goals. this year was basically par for the course. a good season would be a top 4 finish, but it's hard to expect that every season.

overall I like Rodgers better than any non-Klopp candidate and think Klopp even isn't a slam dunk.

The slippery slope you are on is things caused by the HRA. Or things that you are imagining could be caused by the HRA.

They should get the vote. They were allowed to vote in the Scottish independence referendum, they should be allowed to vote in elections. 

Could you address my main point though? This one...

Wouldn't the ECHR still cover those things though? (It's just that you would have to make an appeal to the European courts rather than the UK ones). Personally I like that I can challenge a case on human rights in a UK court without having to go and get some foreigners to rule on it, don't you?

Or are you suggesting we withdraw from the ECHR completely, and thus the Council of Europe? Because you need to understand that such an extreme step is way beyond what Cameron is proposing.

It's pretty rare that a state doesn't comply with a ruling; so far the only one the UK has ignored has been the prisoner voting one - which has been hanging around for a decade. As with all international law it comes down to the governments and the Committee getting together to try to work things out. But unlike most international treaties the ECHR only puts obligations on states, it doesn't give them any benefits (unlike, say, a free trade agreement), so the Council of Europe can't really take any measures against the UK other than kicking the UK out.

In the case of prisoner voting, the issue has been through the ECtHR 3 times now, and the Supreme Court twice (iirc). In each case saying that the UK Government is in breach of its obligations under the treaty and - in the case of the Supreme Court - that the relevant law is incompatible under the HRA.

Fun fact, the pizza as we know it is an American invention. The original a very cheep dish is from the south of Italy that few people would recognise as pizza today and was essentially a pizza base topped with olive oil, salt and sliced onion, maybe a few sliced tomatos if you were pushing the boat out. When Italians moved to American on mass after WW2 a relative economically and food wealthy nation they began adding expensive ingredients such as meat and cheese now that they could afford them and had ready access to them. 

This dish has since travelled back to Italy and been co-opted as an authentic Italian dish, but with a more italian style with less toppings. It's fine to prefer the modern Italian style but to patronize people for preferring American style pizza on the ground it's less authentic just makes you look like a stuck up prick and ignorant to boot.",null,0,null,1432569430,null,0,false,0,crkcqvf,null,t3_372zt3,null,t1_crkcqvf,null,t1_crjkfsk,null,null,null,1433257480,null,1,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,1,null

The court ruled in his favour finding that the council had no legal power to hold a prayer meeting, so the government passed a law giving it that power.

However, the court did quote from one of my [favourite judgments](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/880.html) on this topic, from the wonderfully-named Lord Justice Laws:

&gt; [T]he conferment of any legal protection or preference upon a particular substantive moral position on the ground only that it is espoused by the adherents of a particular faith, however long its tradition, however rich its culture, is deeply unprincipled; it imposes compulsory law not to advance the general good on objective grounds, but to give effect to the force of subjective opinion. This must be so, since, in the eye of everyone save the believer, religious faith is necessarily subjective, being incommunicable by any kind of proof or evidence. It may, of course, be true, but the ascertainment of such a truth lies beyond the means by which laws are made in a reasonable society. Therefore it lies only in the heart of the believer who is alone bound by it; no one else is or can be so bound, unless by his own free choice he accepts its claims.

&gt; The promulgation of law for the protection of a position held purely on religious grounds cannot therefore be justified; it is irrational, as preferring the subjective over the objective, but it is also divisive, capricious and arbitrary. We do not live in a society where all the people share uniform religious beliefs. **The precepts of any one religion, any belief system, cannot, by force of their religious origins, sound any louder in the general law than the precepts of any other. If they did, those out in the cold would be less than citizens and our constitution would be on the way to a theocracy, which is of necessity autocratic.** The law of a theocracy is dictated without option to the people, not made by their judges and governments. The individual conscience is free to accept such dictated law, but the State, if its people are to be free, has the burdensome duty of thinking for itself.

&gt; So it is that the law must firmly safeguard the right to hold and express religious beliefs. Equally firmly, it must eschew any protection of such a belief's content in the name only of its religious credentials. Both principles are necessary conditions of a free and rational regime.

It's an odd sentiment to come from a country that has an official state religion (sort of), but a comforting one.",null,0,null,1432569515,null,0,false,0,crkcsh3,null,t3_375b2r,null,t1_crkcsh3,null,t3_375b2r,null,null,null,1433257500,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

A key thing is to not strain to meditate, don't ""try"" to still the mind. Trying stimulates the nervous system, which is contrary to the objective. Meditating with others, or on a topic, can be very helpful so consider going to lessons. I learnt at Buddhist classes.

Also do what you can to be physically healthy as a stressed body causes elevated adrenaline etc and so racing thoughts. Take supplements, don't sit stationary at your desk for more than say 20 minutes without getting up to move about. Do some regular light exercise. Don't have the TV/radio on unless really necessary.

Why would something being old make it good. Should we have kept feudalism in its entirety then? Appealing to tradition is such a lousy argument when we're talking about something as important as the setup of our country and how we govern ourselves.

*YOUR ADDRESS ON RIGHT HAND SIDE* 


*DATE IN LONG FORM UNDER YOUR ADDRESS*


*THEIR ADDRESS ON LEFT HAND SIDE*


Dear Editor,


Have you ever enjoyed a location so much that you long to be there at all hours of the day? Have you ever relished in the time spent, just idly kicking a ball with your own two feet? I know I certainly have – on Morton Stanley Park, no less.


This incredible patch of greenery which is located in the outskirts urban sprawl we have come to know is famous for its fantastic football which attracts citizens young and old, of all shapes and sizes. It is a relic of the community culture that all too many cities have lost – people come here to socialise and lounge around in the lush field, or to lace up their boots and get stuck in with the beautiful game. It certainly has something for everyone (something which internet cafes and coffee shops certainly lack, no doubt).


As if that wasn’t enough, the park also features a colourful climbing frame ideally suited for children who, with their parents, can enjoy the facilities offered here at Morton Stanley Park. Were I in your position, the thought of food would come in to my head, most certainly – well I can proudly say that this park boasts the finest ice cream in the whole of England. Some residents who have travelled abroad even say that it’s the best in the world!


As we both know, the primal teenage desire for risk and fun has exponentially increased with the invention of scooters and bikes; luckily the park offers the opportunity to show off their skills for their peers’ pleasure, all in the confines of an excellently crafted skate park.


Nature seekers are becoming more and more prevalent in today’s society, and fortunately for them Stanley Morton Park caters to their desires too with its almost  royalty-standard gardens – on more than one occasion has the passerby regaled in the sweet smell of the flowers that lovingly decorate the paths that lead to the woods. Within the woods one will find an array of wildlife; squirrels, robins and even the odd fox. Surely this is a place that anyone, regardless of their background, would want to visit? If that was the question at hand; the answer would most definitely be yes.


Yours Faithfully,


*NAME*


**That would be an A star piece of writing, at the very least an A. What you have to remember is that vocabulary is hugely important and that this DAFOREST techniques shouldn't be overused (see: ""fantastic fun football"" - it just sounds silly). Keep it simple, but also elaborate and well crafted. Try and avoid phrases like ""and this is why others would like it"" i.e. using the phrase from the question - although this is possibly excusable if it's in the first paragraph. If you're at a loss on how to start it, use a rhetorical question like I've done, you can rarely go wrong.** 


**Oh and remember that this would be a formal letter and requires the correct format (address, date, address). You can make the addresses up, just don't spend too long in the exam (1 high street, london road, Nottinghamshire, England for example).**

The premise is entirely wrong because they are not entitled to the crown estates. They belong to the nation and would continue to long after the monarchy is abolished. As I said elsewhere, they only own a handful of private property that are entitled to keep. 

They cost us £300 million a year - one hundred times more than the Irish president and the most expensive Royal Family in Europe.

The tourism argument is also complete bunk. Nobody comes to the UK because of the Royal family. Even Chester Zoo is a more profitable tourist attraction than any Royal residence.

&gt; train to Bank One way time: six and a half to seven hours

How did you calculate this? Glasgow to Euston is approx. four and a half hours . I understand your desire not to rush - but Euston to Bank is only a 10 minute ride on the Northern Line. Even if you're taking things slowly, Glasgow station to Bank station should be doable in 5 hours - which is roughly the same time as the flight.

And this is with our current, ageing and creaking trains. If HS2 can knock an hour off that, it should heavily cut down the number of people who fly the trip. 

&gt;One way Price wise: £150 train or £90-£130 plane inc. train to Bank One way

If you book on the day - yes. Booking in advance, the price drops. And you can bring as much luggage as you can carry : the cheaper plane prices are for hand luggage only flights.

null,false,gin0clock,null,null,null,"Rodgers philosophy is based around probing the opposition and cutting through by running in behind and strikers combining with the attacking midfielders. We saw in his brief cameos this year, when Sturridge plays, it works. 

Balotelli is not enough of a team player to satisfy the style. In fact Balotelli's strengths are free kicks and penalties. Very few of his Milan goals were from open play. Mario isn't a particularly smart footballer, evidenced by his tendency to get called offside a fuck load and generally poor decision making. He's not a bad footballer at all, I'm not saying that. His technique and strength are excellent, but he isn't enough of a team player to work well with Coutinho, Sterling &amp; Henderson, who always seemed to lose faith in him after he made mistakes. He needed service to be effective and his decision making and selfishness on the ball effected his service massively. In short; the team couldn't revolve around Mario because he didn't play for the rest of the team.

Rickie just didn't match the tempo of the play that we wanted to play. In my opinion he's probably one of the most gifted technical players on the team, he obviously understands the game better than most and had the best intentions to be a team player, but when he came on, unlike Balotelli almost tried to hard to work with everyone else. Lambert drifted back towards the midfield to link up, then by the time we reach their box he's still catching up with the play. 

I don't think Brendan gave Fabio enough starts to be honest. While he didn't score, he was more of a nuisance than the other two and always tried to get into the right positions. 

Anyway; I think Brendan convinced himself that we did well in our unbeaten streak because we didn't have a striker on the pitch, when actually it was because Sakho was playing and Gerrard wasn't the one protecting the defence.

There is a *lot* to take in when you first get on a bike - even if, I'm assuming, you were on the 50cc scooter.

I will say, the *only* thing that you specifically did wrong was alert him to the fact you couldn't hear him. But that's not a major problem. Just a ""if it happens again, let him know"" thing.

&gt; This sounds so stupid but I didn't really know one way streets existed...I actually thought the car was in the wrong lane I am so fucking dumb haha.

Ignorance of something doesn't equate to stupidity.  
You've got no experience with road awareness [not your fault, you're young], so that adds to the 'noise' of things you're needing to deal with all at once. Go and buy a copy of the highway code, and read through it. A theory test book will also help, as it phrases things in a different way and lets you see how it is applied.

I chose to do it on a geared bike, and there just wasn't enough time for me to get to grips with the controls. Plus as a smaller person (a girl like yourself) they didn't put any effort into making sure stuff was adjusted to fit me. My main struggles were with the length of the clutch lever, and if it makes you feel any better my main achievement for the day was actually coming off and ending up stuck underneath the bike in someone's driveway. Some random strangers had to help me get out. The instructor had gone, he was somewhere off up the road and didn't even see it happen. His face when I told him I'd come off was a picture, and he didn't believe me till I showed him the bike's battle damage :D

This was 5 years ago and only now am I going to go back and try the CBT again. So my main advice is don't be me and get put off for 5 years! Looking back rationally, I see it wasn't all my fault. But being new and unsure I didn't know what I should be expecting on a CBT. You're ahead of the curve now because you know how it works. This is easier to say than do, but I'd maybe have a word with the people who run the school (rather than the instructor) and see if they can give you a follow up with a different person. 

I wish you all the best, and in a month or so I hope we're both road legal on our bikes :-)

&gt;especially if they become home to the first Nuclear Fusion plant with ITER.

ITER is a really exciting project to construct the worlds first fusion reactor capable of achieving a criterion known as ignition. The JET in Oxford is a Tokamak that has been shown to be capable of generating approximately 70% of the power that has been put into it. Breakeven is defined as when the ratio of power in to power out is 1, which is something we have achieved in inertial confinement experiments I think (depending on how you define power in) and might yet be achieved in JET when they can start being a bit more reckless with it just before ITER comes online. 

ITER itself wont generate any power, just as JET doesn't. There are two problems; only about 20% of the reaction energy is given to massive charged particles which can heat the plasma, so really, a self-sustaining reaction needs to produce 5 times more energy than we put in. We also at the moment have no mechanism for getting energy back out of the heated plasma. Currently the physics effort is focussed on achieving ignition, but then after this we'll need more energy still to account for efficiency losses when using the heated plasma to heat steam for turbines. ITER then will (hopefully) be a proof of concept, but it will still be a big shiny toy for physicists to play with. The plan is that the next generation experiments after ITER will actually have some generating capacity, and I would be very surprised if France got given that privilege (I think Japanese research teams were quite upset about Europe getting ITER). 

&gt;Having just written my dissertation on Geothermal energy, I'm a fan of the Icelandic renewable sector.

Obviously the UK has a big renewable potential, but at the moment, Geothermal isn't one of them. Iceland is lucky (unlucky?) enough to be at the meeting point of two tectonic plates, so hot material from the Earth's mantle is pretty accessible from the surface. The UK is quite far into the plate so we'd have to dig *very* deep to get access to the same kind of material and that doesn't look to be possible for a long time, if ever. Iceland's abundance of an easily-exploitable resource and ridiculously low population density make it possible for them, it would require considerably more effort for the UK to do something similar.

null,false,Monztaa,lfc68,,null,"Yes tweak his system but not change it. Rodgers' principles are dribbling, passing to feet, building from the back, mobility, width and when we have the forwards, penetration. That's how his teams are built, and that's what Rodgers has drilled in from day 1. The problem is that Balotelli and Lambert don't fit in his principles, they are simply not mobile enough and don't make more runs behind (which is why we switched to Sterling, who could replicate that).

Chelsea have not switched their style. I would like you to clarify that however, as I'm not entirely sure what you mean. The way they approach Burnley is the same as to how they would do to PSG (save with intensity etc..). Why do you think Guardiola went toe to toe with Barcelona? Why didn't he stick 10 men behind the ball? Because doing that goes against his principles, the way he knows how to win, the way he's worked since he came to Bayern Munich.

It's easy to state that he should've adapted to Balotelli and Lambert but it goes totally against what he has worked for and more importantly, what he knows best. He doesn't know the game such as using target men well enough. Rodgers' game is built on, as I've mentioned before, mobility and runs. Balotelli and Lambert don't fit that criteria. If you know of any other coach who has done such a switch from a fast and intense game like last season to a slower, pragmatic so to speak game then please mention it (and I'm not being sarcastic).

What I would question of Rodgers is why he didn't work on set pieces more when he worked out that our strikers were struggling. That's on him.

Just as the instructor was about to give up, I realised the bike was in 5th, kicked it down the box to first, and saved the day. Had I not managed that, I'd have ended the day much like you. 22 years later I almost know what I'm doing.

If the school will let you have another go at no extra cost (and some do) then go back to the same place but have a good long chat with the instructor first, to clear the air and sort out anything you got wrong. If you've got to pay again, then you might as well look somewhere else, if only to not have the pressure of knowing you've been there before and flunked. You've got enough to worry about when first riding on the road without having mental demons as well.

Most importantly, don't be discouraged. There's nothing quite like the feeling of freedom the first time you're out on a bike on your own. Well, maybe the second time. The first time I pretty much shat myself.

The base of his article, which is the Forex fines is wrong,

&gt;put bluntly, the world’s most prestigious banks had brazenly and systematically ripped off their clients. It was the crime of the decade. 

The Forex scandal actually really wasn't, it was very different to Libor or insurance mis-selling in that it involved a legal grey area and a practice that a lot of people actually genuinely thought was legal. In addition the gains (and losses to clients) caused are likely to be pretty small, we don't really know because no one, even the regulators bothered calculating them.

There are three excellent articles on the scandal [here (a potted history of the FX market and why that led to this](https://medium.com/bull-market/oranges-and-lemons-the-fx-scandal-in-perspective-cd3456089ce4), [here (trying to quantify the actual profits)](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-11-12/banks-manipulated-foreign-exchange-in-ways-you-can-t-teach) and [here (discussing the recent fines)](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-05-20/bank-fine-scorecard-follow-along-at-home-).

The problem is that the banks have (rightly) lost all credibility so now there is only one size of bank scandal, really really bad, even if actually, it wasn't.

&gt;Bank scandals are all one size: Everything is Bad, but no one wants to think about How Bad. Everything is an indictment of bank culture, and anything that any bank does is added to a list of misdeeds that starts in the financial crisis. There's no effort to evaluate how much harm any particular conduct does, or to correlate that harm with the punishment. The penalties, in FX as in Libor, seem to be indexed to how many bad chat messages you sent rather than how much harm you did. These cases lump together cartel price-fixing, and sensible risk management, and failures of best execution, and common sales tricks, and just plain charging as much as the market will bear.

Small Unmanned Surveillance Aircraft

&gt;Article 167


&gt;The person in charge of a small unmanned surveillance aircraft must not fly the aircraft in any of the circumstances described in paragraph (2) except in accordance with a permission issued by the CAA. 
The circumstances referred to in paragraph (1) are: 
&gt;
a) over or within 150 metres of any congested area;
&gt;
b) over or within 150 metres of an organised open-air assembly of more than 1,000 persons;
?
c) within 50 metres of any vessel, vehicle or structure which is not under the control of the person in charge of the aircraft; or
&gt;
d) subject to paragraphs (3) and (4), within 50 metres of any person.
&gt;

&gt;Subject to paragraph (4), during take-off or landing, a small unmanned surveillance aircraft must not be flown within 30 metres of any person.  

&gt;Paragraphs (2)(d) and (3) do not apply to the person in charge of the small unmanned surveillance aircraft or a person under the control of the person in charge of the aircraft. 
In this article ‘a small unmanned surveillance aircraft’ means a small unmanned aircraft which is equipped to undertake any form of surveillance or data acquisition.

&gt;Summary

&gt;In essence therefore, provided the aircraft has a mass of 20 kg or less, the current regulations state:
&gt;
The operation must not endanger anyone or anything. 
The aircraft must be kept within the visual line of sight (normally taken to be within 500 m horizontally and 400 ft vertically) of its remote pilot (i.e. the ‘person in charge’ of it). Operations beyond these distances must be approved by the CAA (the basic premise being for the operator to prove that he/she can do this safely). 
Small unmanned aircraft (irrespective of their mass) that are being used for surveillance purposes are subject to tighter restrictions with regard to the minimum distances that you can fly near people or properties that are not under your control. If you wish to fly within these minima, permission is required from the CAA before operations are commenced. 
CAA permission is also required for all flights that are being conducted for aerial work (i.e. in very simple terms, you are getting paid for doing it). 
The 'remote pilot' has the responsibility for satisfying him/herself that the flight can be conducted safely.

&gt;Note: there is currently no 'protected' frequency band allocated for the control link between 'remote pilot' and aircraft. Some control frequencies are also 'shared' with other uses (such as Bluetooth and WiFi, or a band for research and development systems). The small UAS manufacturers should be well aware of this, however it would be worthwhile checking with them to ensure that there are no other related precautions which need to be taken with their specific machine. You will need to ensure that any other equipment you routinely need to use does not adversely affect the flight of the aircraft.

&gt;Careful note should be taken that the collection of images of identifiable individuals, even inadvertently, when using surveillance cameras mounted on a small unmanned surveillance aircraft, will be subject to the Data Protection Act. As this Act contains requirements concerning the collection, storage and use of such images, Small Unmanned Aircraft operators should ensure that they are complying with any such applicable requirements or exemptions.",null,0,null,1432575270,null,0,1432575886,0,crkfvnf,null,t3_3781ij,null,t1_crkfvnf,null,t3_3781ij,null,null,null,1433259026,null,7,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,7,null

Punch. A true match winner 

**Most Improved** - Who's been our most improved player, whether it be from last year or from the first half of the season to the second?

Wilf, though still needs to improve more. But great to see him getting his confidence back

***The Freddie Sears Award* for Most Bitterly Disappointing Player** - Who did we have high hopes for that let us down?

That useless lump from Arsenal. Awful. 

***The Johnny Ertl Award* for Most Underrated Player** - Who's the unsung hero of this team?

Damo. Gives his all every time, odd mistake bit more often than not a great performance. 

**Goal of the Season** - What's been your favourite Palace goal this year? Goals scored against us can also count; perhaps call those *the Matty Phillips award.*

Not sure, need to think. 

**High Point of the Season** - What's been our best moment this season?

I think Pards coming in after the way I felt so low after Warnock, and that dreadful Southampton performance. Gave everyone such a lift, then we went on that run and it just feels like getting my club back. 

**Low Point of the Season** - Conversely, what's been the most depressing moment of our season?

That Southampton game. 

**The Liverpool Award for Favourite Opponents** - Who, simply put, have been our bitches this past year? Equally, who's been the most satisfying to beat?

Liverpool. Obviously. 

***The Yannick Bolasie Award* for Favourite Bit of Outrageous Skill** - I'm expecting the wingers to feature heavily here.

That flick YB7 did, I think against Tottenham?

**Most Impressive Individual Opposing Player** - Which opposition player has been the most impressive against us?

Wankers keeper. 

And finally, **Expectations for Next Season** - Where are we going to finish next season?

&gt;__Thomas James Dalglish Ravenscroft__ is a radio presenter, DJ and champion of new and unsigned music.

&gt;The son of Sheila and John Parker Ravenscroft, (the late Radio 1 DJ known as [John Peel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peel)), he is married to Australian fashion designer Louise Markey.

&gt;He may be the youngest person to contravene UK regulations forbidding the broadcasting of foul language after he used a swearword while guesting on his father's *[Offspring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring)* radio show for the BBC in the late 1980's.

Where we are now (vs being a stable CL team), means, regardless of value for money, we're capable of buying fewer players of the calibre of Torres, Alonso and co.

Some signings work out or they don't, but whether Joe Allen was a free agent, an academy graduate or £25m, he's not as good as Alonso.

I would argue that Benitez' signings succeeded more often with the expensive, top quality signings.
Looking for hidden gems wasn't a huge source of Benitez' success.
We wasted a lot of money trying to fill out a CL squad at a time when we had the option to attract relatively better players than now.

That probably did give him more latitude to rotate and compete in cup competitions, but ultimately I think it created a bloated squad that lacked in serious quality.

Now we're basically forced to sign those hidden gem type signings all the time.
We've also overpaid for some of them, but not to the degree where it's really had a massive impact.

One more signing of the same calibre because we were more parsimonious isn't likely to have massively changed our fortunes.

The Government also does not own The Crown Estate.

 itll be a long summer but i can see why the owners want to stick with him.  he  has a lot to improve upon, but so do the people running the club in terms of their vision for team building and transfers.

null,false,aaronhere,null,null,null,"Well this is the thing though, and a comment I had made on a couple occasion.  Rodgers insisted on playing football as if he had the players he wanted, and not the players he had.  If your players don't fit your style, you would seem to have 3 options: change your players, change your style, or try to fit square pegs into round holes.  Too often it seemed Rodgers chose option 3.

A couple of examples.  Stevie's name pegged on as CM/DM even as it was clear it wasn't working. Lucas seemingly struggling to find a spot in the team even as he brought valuable solidity in front of the CBs.  Lovren's string of games while playing terribly.  The lockout of Borini (who, while below-average, was the only striker capable of movement it seems).  The RB situation in general was just a disaster.  Can, Sterling, Hendo all spent time there for some reason, even after it was clear it wasn't working, while we had two (!) players on the bench who specialize at that position who repeatedly failed to get a game.  

On the aforementioned 2nd point, I don't know what went on behind the scenes, but it looked like that was a huge amount of tactical tinkering, yet little in the way of strategic flexibility.  Did we play two up top, at all, this season?  Facing a lack of goals, fluidity, and movement in behind, we lacked a plan b for the entire season.  The 3-4-3 worked for a couple games, but once teams figured it out it really felt like Rodgers just ran out of ideas.

To make a short story long, all of this is a roundabout way of saying Rodgers did a fairly poor job of optimizing the team for the players we had available.  Sturridge wasn't walking through that door to save the team, and as the last few games demonstrated this team was going to struggle to score goals.  Rodgers was surely frustrated with his lack of strikers, but instead of trying to take advantages of the best qualities of each he appeared to try to turn them into into (really) poor man's SAS.

I would imagine the OP is calling this 'scary levels of accuracy' because the OP is surprised that the season went the way it did and surprised that someone 'called it.'

Many supporters like myself knew that we would struggle this season, I always said this would be a 'transitional season' where the new players would learn to play with each other as a cohesive unit, learn to play without Suarez, accept the pressures of taking their game to next level, juggle the League with the Champions League, etc.

However, any of this logic would be shouted down by the masses: Oh, you're too negative. And the logic was constantly ignored as players were criticised, Rodgers was blamed (as if Rafa could have done better with this squad. Ha.), etc.

And then the whinging that exposed any supporters' lack of real interest/knowledge of the sport/club: Butbutbut ... We finished second last season! How could we have possibly be this bad?

This season was always going to be a struggle and it was going to be a transitional season. Which is to suggest that I think our 2015-16 season is going to be significantly better for numerous reasons (and if not, I think this is where I can justify looking for another manager who can build upon what Rodgers has established at Liverpool).

All that being said and with all this talk about how I (and others) knew that we were going to struggle, I have to admit that I didn't think the season was going to the *this* much of a struggle, though. And that loss to Stoke left me speechless for a number of days.

But what's done is done. Hopefully we can make some good moves this summer. I think the entire squad and coaching staff just need to forget about football for a couple weeks before getting on with it.

I see myself as one of the last people to comment on the meaning of verses in the Quran (I have very little knowledge about it and almost no knowledge about its context), but I'm going to do it anyway. It does [contain verses that look like they oppose any kind of integration](http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Qur%27an,_Hadith_and_Scholars:Friendship_with_Non-Muslims). ^-- [^about ^WikiIslam](http://wikiislam.net/wiki/WikiIslam) - and in addition to that page there is also [Quran 3:28](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/003-qmt.php#003.028) ^^edit2 [and this page](http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Qur%27an,_Hadith_and_Scholars:Non-Muslims) which is about how texts and scholars see non-Muslims in general. ^^/ed2

And also some verses which seem to say non-believers are inferior:

* [Quran 48:29](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/048-qmt.php#048.029) - believers are merciful among each other but severe against unbelievers, 
* [Quran 2:10](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.010) - unbelievers are more likely to have diseases (I'd say this might have been true at the time, the [Quran and Hadith include some good basic hygiene practices](http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Hygiene))
* [These three verses which say that people who don't believe are *sub-human*, are the worst of creatures](http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Qur%27an,_Hadith_and_Scholars:Non-Muslims#Non-Muslims_are_sub-human_vile_beasts.2C_they_are_the_worst_of_creatures)

Of course, there are many moderate Muslims who might say that these verses are interpreted incorrectly by those who interpret them literally or without context. But that doesn't change the fact that extremism is founded upon the (too?) literal interpretation of verses like that, as is the unwillingness to integrate.

On the other hand, both Hinduism and Sikhism have no concept of an ""exclusive system"" - they do not see non-believers as 'infidels' who won't make it to heaven, merely as 'unenlightened'. They both have ""many paths"" theology (whereas religions like Christianity have things like ""I am the way, the truth, and the life, no one comes to the Father except through me"" John 14:6).

Hindus mostly believe that you get reborn if you haven't managed to 'liberate' your soul. And if you have, you are free from the cycle of life, death, and reincarnation. They believe that there is one truth, but many paths (belief systems) that can reach it. 

^(Hinduism is quite nebulous, and I only wrote down a general opinion on the religious side of Hinduism, from what I learned from other people and in school. If you ask any particular Hindu, they might have a different opinion.)

Sikhs believe that if you believe in their monotheistic system, and you work to cleanse your soul of vices and evil in your lifetime, you will eventually become part of the universe (of God) when you die. But if you fail to do this, you are reincarnated, and get another chance - even if you are not Sikh. Guru Nanak also asserted that there is ""one truth and many paths"". It was founded during a time of warfare and hate between Hindus and Muslims.

^(I worked in a Sikh faith school for a short time, but it's also easy to find out about Sikhism on the Internet, on sites which explain it in plain English.)

So it would appear that the latter two are just more inclusive by nature. Sikhism especially seeks to promote equality among humanity and genders (and castes and religions), which matches up with modern desired values quite nicely.",null,0,null,1432577620,null,0,1432590492,0,crkh78r,null,t3_373am3,null,t1_crkh78r,null,t1_crk5zi4,null,null,null,1433259649,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

On the other hand, the last month has been dire.  Just dreadful football, with no sense of passion or purpose.  The Sterling situation.  The losses to bottom table clubs and, frankly, even the win against QPR was pretty sad.

2. I don't think the person that made this watched many of our matches. I love Gerrard, but the bias the English press shows him (and most English veterans) is embarrassing.

Coutinho likewise should be near 8. Mignolet, with that many clean sheets is not a 6, sorry. He also kept us in many matches this season. Henderson and Sterling should be 7+ IMO too.

They all believed for example that human nature could be rewritten. This is just one of many entirely non scientific dogmas which constitute communist ideology. They wouldn't allow the study of genetics under communism because it clashed with official ideology. Is that down to atheism? Or is that just a different kind of dogma? 

The other thing they have in common is that they were unelected dictators. Show me the atheistic president or prime minister or chancellor who has murdered millions. Indeed we have run that experiment time and again in places like Denmark, without the disaster you predict.

To say that the Hodgson era had more positives than the Rodgers era so far is not something I would necessarily agree with. I think in trms of youth prospects right now we are in a far far better place, out best young player being Coutinho whereas back under Hodg it was probably Spearing. I gotta disagree with your comment about Spearing being on par with Allen. Spearing is a championship level player, and Allen is actually very good at his job - not saying it's right to play someone like that all the time, but I do think that he does his job well, whereas Spearing was not a very good player. 

I wouldn't say Manquillo is better than Kelly but that is because I think we've seen Manquillo play like 10 times this season. And he's 19, he's bound to improve. Kelly is ok, but he is very very injury prone, but I think he would have been a useful addition this year to the team just down to the fact that Rodgers didn't seem to want to play any of the right backs! 

I agree with the heart of club gone, as Gerrard and Carragher have retired since Hodgson. It's too early to say the soul is gone, we haven't played any games since Gerrard left, hopefully someone will step up.

We deserve to be the butt of the jokes after yesterday, but were we being laughed at last year? No, because we trounced every team barring Chelsea. 

Frankly as a Liverpool fan from Liverpool, the opinion of others doesn't concern me, what matters to me is the fans and the club's opinions.

I appreciate the reply it was thought provoking, but I have to disagree with your disagree haha. For me, there is no way the club is in the shape it was under Hodgson.

Generally speaking they're a good idea IF you think you'll be there for the duration of the scheme. 

Normally, if you resign or are fired, you get your money back or you get the shares at their regular price. So you lose nothing. Unless the shares have fallen in price. 

If you are made redundant or similar, you usually get the shares at the preferential rate. 

Read the scheme documents *very* carefully. It will explain exact how it works. 

At the end of the term you're asked if you want to keep the shares or sell them. It's usually as simple as clicking on a website. 

Depending on the scheme, you may have tax to pay.  The tax may be taken from the proceeds, or you'll have to pay it via self assessment. Again, check the scheme documents. 

In all, share save schemes are a good way to stay invested in the company you work for. Of course, if BT go bust, you lose your job and your shares. Shares can fall in value.

Has he in is 25 years sought UK citizenship? I know his case sounds unfair but there has to be a dividing line. Besides there are plenty of low level criminals disallowed.

Nationalism is being played here. It is not power of government and all that guff, it is nationalism. So get the so called nationals ( excluding the ones who pissed off many years ago because they are not nationals any more ) to vote and have done with it. The argument is tiresome.

:--|:--|
**Player of The Season** | **James McArthur.** Consistently played well over the season. Added quality in our midfield. He works hard, tackles well, can pass it, and has made a few important clearances off the line. 
**Most Improved** | **Wilfried Zaha**. I think recently, under Pardew he has really kicked on. He's getting a few more goals, and could have scored against Swansea. His decision making is getting better as well. With more experience I expect him to get even better.
**The Freddie Sears Award for Most Bitterly Disappointing Player** | **Yaya Sanogo.** I don't really know what he offers. Not Premier League quality, and will certainly leave Arsenal soon. Seems like a nice guy, I really wanted him to succeed. Not many players disappointed me thankfully.
**The Johnny Ertl Award for Most Underrated Player**|**Hangeland**. He's made a couple of mistakes, but apart from that he's been very solid. He wins every header, can distribute it well, and is calm under pressure. If he was a bit younger and quicker on the turn he would be my first choice centre back. He's also a great professional.
**Goal of the Season** | **Jason Puncheon's** free kick against Manchester City. The placement was perfect, right in the bottom corner. 
**High Point of the Season** | Outplaying Liverpool at Anfield in Steven Gerrard's last game there, after losing 4 in a row. I thought our season was pretty much over, but it shows we have a great mentality to bounce back in a game where everyone's focus will be on the opposition. 
**Low Point of the Season** | Crystal Palace 1-3 Sunderland. One shot on target, Jedinak sent off. Losing at home hurts, but to lose 1-3 against Sunderland is taking the piss.
**The Liverpool Award for Favourite Opponents** | I think playing Dover was a nice change of pace. After being dominated by a lot of teams under Warnock, to play Dover and out class them was quite jarring but enjoyable to see, even though we're 4 leagues ahead of them. It was nice taking 4 points from Tottenham. Of course the double against Liverpool can't be beat though.
**The Yannick Bolasie Award for Favourite Bit of Outrageous Skill** | [James McArthur on David Silva.](https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video/CB8gzjxWIAAteei.mp4) 
**Most Impressive Individual Opposing Player** | I thought Mane was excellent when we played Southampton at home.
**Expectations for Next Season** | Get to 40 points and build from there. I think we will stay up. It would be nice to aim higher, and hopefully we can if we start the season well.",null,0,null,1432579780,null,0,1432580071,0,crkiewj,null,t3_377qcl,null,t1_crkiewj,null,t3_377qcl,null,null,null,1433260221,null,4,false,crystalpalace,t5_2tqdj,4,null

Use wingers more effectively to attack the space that Balo/Lambert leave behind when they come deep. 

Chelsea have definitely switched their style, at the start of the season you saw them play free flowing football with Ivanovic basically operating as a winger. They switch it up when Remy or Drogba come on compared to Costa. As the season progressed, they switched systems, operating in a far more defensive counter attacking style. 

Pep is the most tactically flexible manager in the world. He's played direct more often to Lewa several times in the Bundesliga, most notably against Dortmund earlier the season. When they've lost their wingers, he dropped Goetze to play more centre mids with the fullbacks offering the width. Against Bayern, it was tactics not principles that made him play like that. Pressing high to starve the Barca front 3 of the ball but it didn't work because Barca are brilliant on the ball amongst several other reasons.

My point is that if your personnel does one thing, but your system does another, you've got to be able to be flexible and change things up. When Lambert was signed, Liverpool fans were happy because it was a plan B but Rodgers seems to never have tried coaching the players in different system therefore there's not really a plan B. As for the manager question, I can't think of any from the top of my head but I can assure you that as an Arsenal fan, I have seen injuries and I have seen Wenger change and tweak the system to maximise the players he has available and we're relatively stable in terms of league finishing positions.

As for set pieces, yeah, Liverpool have been awful at them. Then again, most top teams are pretty woeful at them from the complaints I've seen.",null,0,null,1432579797,null,0,false,0,crkif8l,null,t3_377pve,null,t1_crkif8l,null,t1_crkfgm2,null,null,null,1433260225,null,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

Stevie G was never a competent DM and the RB decision has been crazy. I've mentioned this on a few match threads before only to be told that Can has experience playing at RB. It's not how football works in the long term and its madness that Rodgers kept doing it with Johnson and Manquillo fit.

Plan B was meant to be Lambert but its clear Liverpool never really did any work on it in training. It just felt that instead of small tactical changes throughout the season, Rodgers suddenly thought at certain parts of the season that the whole formation failed and scrap everything. The amount of mistakes that were made time and time again was baffling.

I think you've summed my thoughts well in the last paragraph.

null,false,TheSoundOfBells,null,null,null,"I live in Switzerland, and just to clarify: Not every law is voted on by the public here. Citizens can propose constitutional changes and force a public vote on them if they can collect a sufficient number of signatures in favour of the referendom, and they can call a referendum against new legislation introduced by parliament, again by collecting signatures. In addition, any changes to the constitution, even if they are not introduced through a citizens' initiative, must automatically be approved by public vote.

Voting on laws is done every three months, and there are usually 2-4 national issues and a small handful of municipal ones. Voting on a significantly larger number of things is generally considered unpractical. People are (at least in theory) expected to familiarise themselves with the issue to make their vote as well-informed and well-considered as can be, and there is a lot of public and media debate before every such vote. If all legislation had to be approved directly by the public, it would simply be unrealistic to expect voters to have the time and energy required to actually familiarize themselves with each issue to a sufficient degree to make a truly sensible decision - that's practically a full time job. You'd end up with people voting based on gut feeling rather than reason, or with people just not bothering to vote at all. And while I think direct democracy is fundamentally a great thing, it can also lead to poor decisions if the voting public does not vote with the proper care and consideration.

So: The Swiss system does offer direct democracy to a degree, and I am a big fan of it mainly because it does a lot to solve the problem of politicians being able to do pretty much what they want once they're elected.

* It's going to be fairly likely her student accommodation won't look anything like the posher neighbourhoods she may have visited if she's ever been here on holiday. She's going to need to get used to everything being smaller (e, g, the kitchen, the refrigerator, her closet) and also she'll probably have flatmates. 

* Stores will close frustratingly early, and since they're so small the convenience of getting everything in one quick stop is going to be something she misses. Even if she does venture out to Zone 3+ and a larger mall she'll quickly realise that she doesn't have any idea which stores will sell what items, so her shopping trips at first will still feel a bit like a scavenger hunt. Also, if she's not already used to living without a car, well, she'll only be able to carry so much home with her on the bus/Tube at any one time and there will be times when she'll have to come back later to get things she can't carry. 

* Motorists will seem particularly hell-bent on killing her as she tries to cross the street, but eventually she'll pick up on the differences in the traffic codes. 

* There's also more of a language barrier than initially expected. It's not really struggling to maintain any particular conversation, but there are nonverbal cues and shades of meaning that she won't be used to picking up and all of it together can be quite difficult.

All that said, we love it here and can't imagine how hard it will be eventually when we have to leave. It could very well be the same with her. It seems to me based on my talking with other Americans here that everyone struggles with things in the first 2-3 months, but most will eventually find their groove and things get easier.

Solve - you need to figure out what the letter is equal to. ""Solve for x"" would mean you have to find (algebraically) what x is worth. Answer would be given like: ""x = 4"" or, if quadratic, ""x = 2 or 6"" (for example).  

Simplify - break down into its smallest integer (whole number) parts. E.G. 3/6 can be *simplified* into 1/2.  

Factorise - put into brackets! You should have been taught how to do this class, it just means separating an equation into parts that multiply out (expand) into the original. For example, 2x^2 can be factorised into (2x)(x).

3. Let's say that somehow they did, ignoring the fact that it's going on out of their jurisdiction and they don't have power of arrest in a foreign country. They'll immediately be replaced with whoever is next in the chain of command.

ISIS is more than just it's leaders. It's an entire group of terrorists, and most importantly, it's an idea. You can't destroy an idea by taking out a few people at the top.

Solving a problem like ISIS takes a multi-pronged approach - finding out where their money is coming from and cutting it off, cutting off the supply of weapons, better education to curb the spread of radicalisation making it harder for them to recruit new members, as well as simply engaging them in combat where appropriate... there are also diplomatic difficulties - the allies and enemies of all the involved parties are fairly complex and need to be taken into account too.

Even tho Liverpool fans thought we can only challenge 4th spot with ManUnited. They spent 150m and they were just less struggle than us. We just missed out top four (not mathematically but we were once very close to top4). 
Of course I'm disappointed with the result but I think the result is acceptable. Brendan is no tactical genius but I see him as a manager of the club not just a head coach. People want Rafa back just because Rafa is a tactical expert which lead us to good results but I think we gave chances to Rafa before. I still think Brendan is okay with his job but he need to work on his tactics and learn how to handle media and the changing room's expectation. 
I don't think Rafa is a perfect replacement for Brendan. Personally I would prefer Brendan to stay put unless Klopp wants to come and rebuild us like what he did in Germany .........

We have done a Sterling - Balotelli with Sterling being the runner but what you get is that the opposition surround Balotelli and his touch heavily suffers for it. I remember a distinct game in which Rodgers tried that and he changed it in half an hour. 

Chelsea operate in a far more defensive system when they need to (when they play big teams). That's all. Stats prove that. Not sure I can agree with you on that. Mourinho plays with big target men up front. Drogba and Costa fit that, and Remy isn't a small lad either. You don't switch systems. I think you're getting confused here. A system is a definite way of playing, with set principles to adhere to. All managers have 1 set system that they stick to. Mourinho has never changed his system. He's changed the way he has approached games, but the system remains the same. I get what you're saying, but it's not the system that is changing but the tactics. 

Bayern played direct to beat the press but as soon as they did, and as soon as Dortmund realized that, they stopped pressing so hard and Bayern asserted their dominance. And it was absolutely principles that made Bayern go toe to toe with Barca. Because if they tried to do something which they hadn't been coached to do then it would've failed. Bayern practice pressing almost all their coaching sessions, and 2 years into that, they're going to abandon that because Barcelona keep the ball better than they do? No. 

You don't change systems. No manager can (succesfully). Rodgers isn't going to start to tell his centerbacks to launch it to Balotelli for a flick on when he has spent 3 years telling his center backs to pass the ball back. It takes years of drilling into and no manager throws that away.

Look at Wenger. He's always had powerful physical presences up front. Adebayor, Van Persie, Giroud, Welbeck. Now if you remove a striker (play with a false 9) he will struggle. It's nothing to do with adaptation, it's more that he doesn't know a different way of playing. 

So overall, a manager cannot change a system. That would be throwing away years of hard work and most managers know one way of playing and one system that they stick to all throughout his/her coaching career. Now you can disprove that if you find me a manager that has changed his system.

Yeah they can be found on social media, but they'll be covering their tracks. You won't be able to track them down to a physical location. And even if you could, they probably have moved on by the time you did.

For anybody who doesn't read the forum, this may seem harsh - but anyone that did will know that a more arrogant, unlikeable man you could not wish to discuss football with. He puts people down in oddly cruel ways, while elevating himself to god status.

For the last half season, he's demonised Balotelli, claimed he knew he was terrible all along, claimed that 'of course' we wouldn't finish Top 4 and there's no way anybody Sane would think we could, insulted and poured scorn on all who disagreed. The problem, nobody could prove him wrong because the transfer forum was shut and therefore unviewable. He repeatedly claimed that people would see the truth the day it opened.

Today, it did. Coincidentally, he's also left the site in a huff.

------------

**August 24th - as Balotelli is confirmed**
&gt;[We're in for a brilliant season]. 3rd minimum, and another genuine title challenge after Christmas. We are, as Sammy Lee once said, back.


**August 24th**
&gt;""The more I think he'll actually make Sturridge better (in a way that Suarez was never going to).""


**August 24th**
&gt;""Certainly, as far as the attack, we're stronger in both depth and quality this season.""


**August 24th - in response to so,embody suggesting a lot of Balotelli's goals had come from penalties, something he himself would bang on about non stop from January onwards...**
&gt;""Oh, do penalties not count as goals then? It also tells you that he has excellent shooting technique. That's why he is trusted to take penalties""


**August 25th**
&gt;""I'm excited by this. He's some talent with the ball. He may turn out to be the trickiest of the Tricky Reds. We're definitely going to be great to watch again this season.""


**August 27th**
&gt;I maintained that if he came here he would be perhaps our most naturally gifted player.""


**August 29th - defending Balotelli's lack of assists, something he now criticises daily**
&gt;""The problem with judging a player by assists is that they only count if the receiver scores. So a player may make a decent number of great passes, only for the striker to mess it up. So the pass doesn't show up as an ""assist"". 
Balotelli is comparable to Sturridge and Mata for chances created, key passes and assist totals. I would hazard a guess that this season might be his best season yet""


**August 29th**
&gt;""Sturridge and Suarez only made 8 assists for each other. That's only 2 more than Balotelli made on his own. There isn't much for a Balotelli-Sturridge partnership to live up to, when you think about it.""


**August 30th - bonus Lucas edition**
&gt;""Why would he even get close to 15 games? Sell. He as absolutely no purpose in a squad as good as this one.""


**August 30th**
&gt;""The usual negativity from the usual people. Balotelli is bargain and whatever you think of him, no defender will enjoy playing against him and he guarantees goals. 


**September 1st - responding to the post ""Hopefully I'm wrong but I'm suddenly concerned that we don't have enough attackers. Anyone else share this concern?""**
&gt;""Nope. Idiot.""

PoP then spent months telling everyone we didn't have any strikers.

**September 1st**
&gt;""Sterling and any one of Sturridge or Balotelli, with Lallana or Coutinho behind them, would be frightening for any central defence to deal with. :D ""


**September 3rd**
&gt;""Balotelli will be aces by Christmas"" 


**September 5th**

You can't filter the internet it was implicitly designed to work, to be able to maintain connections. To reroute past any and all blockages, to find a way.

The only way the UK filters work is to whole rely on ignorance. Ignorance and a common belief that it works. Anyone with half an hour and Google can figure out how to bypass the filters. Sure as heck the kids they are trying to protect have the time and curiosity to figure it out. The determination of a horny 14 year old can not be underestimated. Pulling themselves around their bedroom at the thought of a nipple slip. Sure as heck going to find a way to get porn.

The only people who ""think"" it works are unquestioning drones the same people that think the Yale lock on their front door is secure. The ones that think WiFi password going to keep the bad people off their network. A common belief system is the glue that holds these people worlds together.

As for the EU taking a stand against this stupidity, good on em.

Ive applied for one job which was working at a major computer hardware store that builds computers, but never got a reply back so I'm not putting much hope on them getting back to me. I mainly want to work with computers since its the only thing I'm actually good at.

 Also its not that I'm not thankful to my parents for offering a job with them, its just that I help them every so often as it is and its a dirty job (its not a high end engineering firm) and would require a few months for them to train me. By the time I'm trained I would replace my dads job which means that I would be taking over the company and that's not something I want to do for the rest of my life.

As I said we probably won't get higher than fifth, however, Spurs have finished higher than a team who had the players to get into the champions league. You don't have the right manager, half of your squad practically didn't turn up this season. 

Despite beating us (which tbh we're shit against top 6 teams... thats something to work on and improve once we fix that we're in the top four guarenteed), you threw away far too many easy results this season (Crystal Palace, you were what 3-0 up??). Which in turn made you a team who was fighting for fourth, a team who was fighting to stay in the top 6. You we're lucky Southampton didn't get a result otherwise, Rodgers would be out.

If he buys proper players and gets rid of your shit in the summer then maybe ""maybe"" you'll get top 4.

Until then mate, stop calling me a cunt when i'm right. Because thats the sign of a sore loser. This was intended as a bit of banter but you just proved to me how fucking awful some of your fanbase are.

Burnham will always be painted as too close to the Unions, Cooper, also close to the Unions, is inextricably linked to Balls and that will always be used as a mighty weapon against her - both will quickly be painted with the failings of the Blair and Brown cabinets they both bore collective responsibility in. 

I haven't enjoyed Kendall's stridency thus far, and am a *little* more swayed by Creagh. I do think it would be valuable to have a female leader and someone who represents a Northern constituency with irish roots would do very nicely in terms of drawing a contrast against Cameron and Osborne. She can speak to a geographic area in which we have start performing well from experience, and speak with authority on the EU. Reading a little of what she's written in the press it appears she 'gets' Scotland.

I like her position on business, she's good in the Commons and lands punches well, her background means she would be taken seriously on the EU and its is difficult to assail her with the usual 'metropolitan-elite' attacks despite her Oxbridge education.

It's not perfect but it's a better solution which provokes more discussion and engagement than individual threads of crap rumours which will still get upvoted by some people because not everyone knows the Metro and similar sources are crap.

Quite literally, if you browse the extensions page of Chrome or Firefox, there are extensions for said browsers on the front-page which explicitly mark themselves as ""bypassing porn filters"" or ""stopping Cameron's censoring"". Honestly, a ten-year-old could install them. 

I'm not saying that a twelve-year-old should have access to porn, but I sometimes worry about the actual effect that these filters are having. For starters, they're catching out legitimate sites which provide important information but feature key words similar to a porn site. These could be sites on sexual abuse, sexuality, or other material that may actually be beneficial for youth to access. LGBT teenagers in particular can find solace, quite often, online.

Secondly, they lull parents into a false sense of security. Not every site which isn't caught by the filters is appropriate for children. Even YouTube has some decidedly 18+ content. How many children watch so-called gaming Let's Plays with men constantly swearing or talking about sex? 

Finally, I worry that people are developing polarising but frankly unhealthy attitudes to sex and pornography. Again, I'm not saying that young teenagers should necessarily have access to hardcore pornography, but at the same time I think just ignoring the matter altogether and pretending it isn't an issue is stupid. Teenagers are going for puberty, they have tons of hormones, and it's only natural that they want to release it. I think that, above all, it's important to emphasise that the media's portrayal of sex is unrealistic (and we're not just talking porn here).

She's an unelected old German woman living a life of utter luxury and opulence at the cost of the state and there's no reason why you should feel any pride about her or show any deference towards her.

By all accounts, the monarchy produces a net profit to the Treasury and the UK as a whole, not a loss. The Crown Estate, which is a statutory corporation, posted a record profit of £253m last year. That is 7.2x greater than the £35m they're given from the government. 

If you don't want to defer to the Queen or respect the Royal Family, that's completely your prerogative. I can tell you that having moved here from the US, I'll take the Queen any day over the complete fiasco that is the executive branch and the massively inefficient and wasteful paradigm that costs Americans insane amounts of money over there. Not to mention that the Queen is politically neutral and, in my opinion, a much more gracious head of state who has built and incredible amount of goodwill and respect in my eyes. Is she or her relatives perfect? Of course not.

11 points here show that this opinion seems quite widespread, considering the downvotes. And I'm really surprised by this, when I see how much hate there are towards series 8.

* how bad Danny / Clara relationship was

* how bad Kill the Moon, Robot of Sherwood, the finales, and mostly Forest of the Night were. 

* Moreover there are the people that don't like Clara.

* It seems Capaldi is not the most popular nuwho doctor yet. 

* except Mummy, Deep Breath and Listen there are not many great episodes according to this reddit. And according to many people even less episodes would be ranked in the best nuwho.

Ive been looking for part time jobs that related to my course for about 6 months (I have been lucky that I didn't *need* to get a job). Ive only been looking for a full time job for the past week or so which is why I was asking if anyone knew other job areas that are computer related but that are less easy to find. 

Im now looking for a full time job now(although I have no problem with part time) since I'm not going to university and have no plans to go back into education next year. I said to myself that if I am either in a job that doesn't relate to my qualifications or unable to get a job at all then I'll look at going to university after a year. I didn't want to go next year as I was unsure what I wanted to do and didn't want to pick something that I would later have no interest in or hate doing.

My skill level is that of someone leaving college. I don't have much experience in employment except a volunteering position where I helped the in-house tech support for an online retailer for 5 months (part-time).

Edit: I just looked up them two jobs (both similar positions at different places) and in the fine print it says that I must be certified in a few different areas (MCDST and a child caring cert (don't know why since its not a teaching position)).

Liverpool owe nothing to Rodgers to because they gave him his shot at the big time and he has to prove himself, all he's given us so far was one really great season that fell short and 2 highly mediocre ones. Sterling can be argued to owe Liverpool the length of his contract stay since they placed faith in him at a very young age and has been given more than his share of game time, in effect Liverpool helped him get to the stage where the biggest clubs would be interested, at considering he is so young and has a long career ahead of him, it seems a bit quick to pull a move.

ISIS is a far reaching organisation that stretches from Pakistan to Syria and Iraq. What are we gonna do? Send out bobbies with blue flashing lights on their helmets to arrest them in the Middle East? 

Ignoring the fact that they don't have jurisdiction in any country except the UK, just look at the numbers. We have what, 60,000 police officers in this country? ISIS has hundreds of thousands of members. They advertise in papers for recruits in countries like Jordan. They have a media branch, they have hi-tech weaponry, a fully fledged infrastructure. Last year they were making 100million a day just from black market oil sales.

They aren't some mickey mouse group, they are a highly organised, highly effective collective. Even if by some absolute feat of magic they all were arrested, new leaders would instantly take their place within minutes. 

I don't think you've thought this through in the slightest. Unless I'm missing something.

Unfortunately arresting them is just as stupid idea as trying to kill them all. It's impossible. This is a problem that goes far beyond the realms of control of the UK. All we can do is limit the damage and try to hit them economically and hope the people on the ground in their respective countries form an uprising and side with the west to weaken them, and accept our offer of training and support to get these fuckers out of power - and with the west's foreign policy and IS's very attractive membership benefits, this isn't going to happen soon.",null,0,null,1432584834,null,0,1432585035,0,crkl6o0,null,t3_378hzq,null,t1_crkl6o0,null,t3_378hzq,null,null,null,1433261527,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Most Improved - Glenn Murray. I thought as a premiership player he was shit. Even though he only played a handful of times last year, I had wrote him off. Got goals. Is a handfull. Can't complain. Also Zaha in May is a fucking lot better than Zaha in September. 


The Freddie Sears Award for Most Bitterly Disappointing Player - Jedinak. A leader, warrior and solid player. Since the Mickey Mouse cup he left us for and then the fucking pointless elbow at 3-1 against WHU, the team under Pardew has evolved and Jedinak wasn't there for it. His performances have (rightly) seen him on the bench. Also Kelly was disappointing. Coming from a big club, he's poor. 



The Johnny Ertl Award for Most Underrated Player - I don't think we really have one. Any player for consideration as a key player, are all the ones that get noticed. Speroni, Ward, Dann, Punch, McArthur, Bolasie, Zaha. On that note... Hennesey? I would like to see him be #1 next season.


Goal of the Season - For: Jedinak Liverpool. Against: QPR's.


High Point of the Season - Due to my daughters birth in November, I only managed to get to about 10 home games this season. My best at the stadium was Man City, but had I been there, I would have probably said Tottenham at home. 

Low Point of the Season - Southampton at home. Move on. 


The Liverpool Award for Favourite Opponents - Burnley, Leicester and Liverpool have all been 6points (except Burnley but meh). I think spoiling Gerrards big day makes Liverpool the most satisfying to beat


The Yannick Bolasie Award for Favourite Bit of Outrageous Skill - Hear me out. Bolasie's spin and flick against Tottenham was technically the hardest BUT his thigh and flick over Lovren, crossed to Ledley to make it 2-1 against Liverpool was A more important and B had end product. Bolasie over Lovren at home 3-1.

 And a friendly correction; the palace game we threw away was last season. But your point still stands, we threw a lot of games.

I get that, and you're right, NATO does have a lot less influence than the EU. I'm not at all trying to claim that they're on the same level, more trying to rationalise why I see the EU as *more* an international relations issue than it is constitutional (although clearly it's both).

&gt; EU membership, on the other hand, outright prevents many things, and non-compliance with others can be met with fines.

The UN can do this too, arguably in a more convincing fashion. UNSC resolutions are binding in a very real sense, and require incorporation into English law just the same as EU law does. ICJ contentious cases are  also binding and can result in financial and political repurcussions for the UK, much the same as the ECJ and ECHR.

second big help was reading my highway code non stop for ages before i did it, helps you know the road markings and when to give way etc. Go and buy a highway code, that's 2.50, go and have a nice coffee or something and read it for an afternoon.

third big help, everyone is almost always going above the speed limit slightly, you're going to be on a moped if you're 16, so you just need to remember to look around, do the life saver check (you're looking for bicycles and mopeds mainly, so look all the way on the direction you're turning)

Fair enough. Not sure I totally agree at this stage but I'm more than happy to accept that it seems to resolve the issue I had.

&gt; You are undecided about the HRA because of issues you have with the ECHR. No-one is planning to scrap the ECHR. 

I'm not undecided because of that. I'm undecided because its proponents seem to have failed to put adequate thought into what they actually believe the role of the convention is with respect to English law, and its opponents mostly seem to have really mixed up confused ideas.

Personally I'd go for a clearer HRA, that actually resolves this sort of issue explicitly but I can't decide if that would be a good idea.

Trivial, you say?

Literally *everything* Robespierre did was couched in terms of God.. He founded the Cult of the Supreme Being! He actively clamped down on atheistic revolutionary movements. 

Is that your best example?

&gt;And the prime minister of Denmark doesn't describe herself as an atheist that I've ever seen. But then you wouldn't know anything about that either

There have been five avowedly atheist Danish Prime Ministers in living memory.

Hell Clement Attlee was openly atheist! There are some in this country who think the creation of the welfare state was an act of evil, I'll give you that, but Stalin he was not.

Edit: also, though I feel no need to claim Einstein as an atheist, for removal of doubt, this was his position:

&gt;I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.

Even further, the ""upgrades"" that people think are going to fix the problem haven't worked: the WCML upgrade in the mid-2000s went way over budget and didn't end up with important signalling, speed and capacity outcomes that were originally expected, for instance. 

Apart from HS2, Network Rail is undertaking massive investment in the network as it is and over the coming years through the Northern Hub, GWML and MML electrification schemes, the Thameslink Programme and numerous station and track reconfiguration and renovation/updates, combined with new rolling stock that will provide greater capacity and improvements particularly to the North as trains are shifted from the South East. 

HS2 complements these schemes but is integral to their success. On their own, they provide piecemeal and necessary improvements but cannot fix the overriding problems that face the railway network.

Legalisation means the government can say who shops can sell to, and I doubt there'd be a big enough market in children for the black market to stick around.

Also, in Portugal their drug use rates dropped since they decriminalised all drugs.

&gt;Heavy marijuana use causes poor memory and abnormal brain structure. Source.

Honestly not an argument for keeping it illegal, tobacco &amp; alcohol are stupidly dangerous yet we keep them legal since they bring in a lot of tax money &amp; we've seen what happens with prohibition.

That article further backs up my point. It never said Fallows and Hunters were approached before Rodgers got job. Again the initial plan was to have a DOF, but Rodgers refused. They scrapped that idea and came up with the scouting committee, at which point Fallows and Hunters were approached.

&gt; He may have had full control over who he targeted because the scouting team (Fallows and Hunter) could not officially work with Liverpool, but that doesn't mean he could sign who he wanted

That is exactly what I'm arguing. He had full control over who we **targeted**, leading to us targeting and signing Borini and Allen. Of course he had to work within the structure that FSG set, but he controlled who we initially targeted, and ended up signing. Ayre handled the negotiations, but he can only negotiate for the players who we target...

&gt; Remember, he also targeted Sigurdsson, but FSG would not shell out the money it would have taken to get him.

That was actually Rodgers who didn't want give him more. Siggy had agreed a move to Swansea during the season, agreeing to a wage and everything, but when Rodgers left for LFC, Siggy decided to see what else was out there. LFC offered him the same wage he agreed to at Swansea while Spurs offered him more.

Gloss over that though your post is constructive. My knowledge of Liverpool results have been shit (hence the Crystal Palace reference being wrong) I thought it was this season, but with both teams losing so much. Its all blurry now.

Our goal difference for a few seasons has been atrocious for a top 4 challenging side, because we have a director of football who signs people who played well in a ""lesser league"" than the premiership and think they are the dogs bollocks. Hopefully Levy actually listens to Pochettino and not Baldini otherwise we'll end up with more shit this summer than we need (and we have a lot of dingleberries holding onto an opportunity to play shit in the premiership). But I digress I'm ranting about Spurs on a Liverpool forum because sour grapes or whatever.

I think Rodgers isn't the manager to drive you forward. I think hes good but last season you got into the Champions League purely on Suarez's goals (you could put Suarez in a 9-1 formation and he'd still score three or four goals). Hes an immense player. Just what you bought for the money you got was (like Spurs) a fucking waste. Now whether he made those decisions or it was down to a Director of Football I don't know. But I just don't think you're entire team has made the impact it should of, and I think Rodgers is partly to blame. 

To put it into perspective, your top scorer was Stevie G with 13, and then Sterling with 11( Source BBC). One players already left, the other is probably leaving in the summer, and if he doesn't he should be dropped because his attitudes been fucking awful all season. With those two gone, whos going to be scoring for Liverpool?

Spurs are similar although, we seem to have consistency and a team that wants to press and play proper exciting football. I think some of our players from the 100m spree we had are starting to show that they want to play. Kanes (29) been immense but whether we keep hold of him is a different matter, Chadli(13) has been good, Lamela(5) has been on and off all season (although the Rabona was nice), Eriksen(12) has been quality but again its on and off. But most of these players are probably staying next season because apart from Kane, nobody wants the others at the price we want to sell at. Except Lloris. I expect him to be a cash cow.

That being said lets see what the summer brings, and then try and knock teams out of those top 4 positions.

I just love the sheer brute denial that so often goes along with modern atheism. No matter what I say - even if I point out that the other, much larger cult that followed the revolution was The Cult of Reason, which isn't just similar to modern atheism it pretty much *is* the entire foundation of modern atheism and that the atheists following it committed horrifying crimes against believers despite having absolutely nothing to do with communism - you will always find a way to tell yourself that it had nothing to do with the fact that they were atheists. 

Even if I point out that at least three if the five worst mass murderers of all time were atheists, still you will tell yourself that atheism is s movement of reason and peace. 

Even if we bring up the fact that they killed more people in one century than every holy war, inquisition and witch hunt in history combined, *still* you will tell yourself that the real villains are the believers. 

The truth is that every kind of madness and violence has been justified in the name of religion. But all the religions of the world combined cannot even approach the unequaled malice and matchless hatred with which atheists mindlessly flog the world.

Verbatim.

How did Rodgers not want to give him more?  He's not in control of wages.  What?

Anyway, that second article perfectly explains who Rodgers targeted that first summer.  We didn't have our scouts in place, so why would FSG, who already are unwilling to splash, let BR buy anyone and everyone he wants at any cost?  So he targeted players who were cheap and who he had some familiarity with as low risk options to hold us over until Barry and Fallows came in.  If they panned out, great.

The lack of any empirical / evidence base for political decision making (4) [mcDermott] creates fertile ground for personal benefit seeking and, again, allows the ""noisiest voice"" to carry excessive weight. I'm specifically thinking of corporate lobbying here. 
We clearly do have overt and covert corruption in the EU political channels, alongside €millions of lobbying for corporates. We do not have any evidential or experimental methods by which to ""test"" TTIP or ISDS. We don't have a placebo. We don't have a control. The unregulated free market, TTIP and ISDS have become articles of political ""faith"". I'm inclined to support a regulated free market. (5) [Hilton]

null,false,davegod,null,null,null,"Back when fish and chips became a thing, all the chippys were controlled by the Italian immigrants. When take-away food ranges expanded, including American style pizza, they just added to their range. Considering they could add the pizza market for the cost of pizza ovens, it'd be a bit daft not to. The Turkish then move in and you get kebab shops, which are basically just adding a kebab cooker. Then the Indians and Pakistanis come in and well that shit is just squirted out of bottles. It's really not all that odd considering it's not really Italian/Turkish/Indian/Chinese food anyway, there's often not much on the menu that carries more than a passing resemblance to ethnic food. 

So anyway the market at this point is basically all this generic crap, pretty much exclusively ran by immigrants needing to make a living rather than a passion for food or whatever. It's all pretty crap really but the market is used to it. You move in and even if you have some talent you have to compete with places each member of the family can have whatever they want, and anyway half of the customers aren't picky, they're getting take-away because they're pissed or too knackered to cook. 

The Chinese take away were the last of the big ones to move in and it's a lot more unusual for them to offer the other types. There was one near where my friend stayed which had it on the menu but they'd made some arrangement with a neighbouring take away. 

There are good take aways, most of them specialist though there are several good generic ones, and also places that sell authentic ethnic food, but you have to find them.  Proper Italian pizza is a bit lacking maybe, only good one I can think of is La Favorita. The odd cross-cuisine thing may be a British curiosity which results from history, but having to find the good places is consistent with just about every city in every country I've ever been in. Until you get to know the city your hit/miss ratio here will be as bad as mine would be in Melbourne.

Loved visiting.  My favorite thing was the Yorkshire Sculpture Park.  Unbelievably beautiful.
Went to York and the Shambles.  Interesting and overcrowded.  Enjoyed walking the city wall.
Leeds was a beautiful city.  Very livable and modern.
Would love to return to the sculpture park and the Hepworth Wakefield in the future.
Thanks for all of the recommendations everyone.  Wish I had more time.

Hahahaha, Camerons crusade against online porn is really shambolic, he has had to sack one of his closest advisors, Patrick Rock for having kiddie porn on his pc, whilst he advised Cambo on trying to attack porn websites.

*The unmarried 62-year-old, who has been tipped for a peerage, was closely involved in a government group drawing up policy on internet porn filters last summer.

Mr Rock’s resignation came last month when the PM learned he was at the centre of a police probe over images of child abuse*.

If only Cameron and his advisors were so zealous in uncovering the Westminster paedophiles.

Many of those candidates are likely to belong to a party, but you don't hear any of them calling for recounts to save a deposit. It would be financial nonsense to request a hugely expensive recount over a deposit. A great way of giving future opponents free ammunition over your willingness to waste public money and time for personal gain. If you stand and you lose your deposit, tough. It's part of the political 'game'. You're clearly miles from being electable for whatever reason, accept it and move on. I'm certain the vast majority, if not all, that lost their deposit knew it was a risk when they stood and it's only a small part of any realistic costs involved in standing for election. I'm pretty astounded this is getting any debate.  There are rules about recounts, initially the returning officer decides if it's reasonable. There is also a special election court. It costs £400 to appeal and up to £5000 as security against costs. I would be astounded if anyone has ever seriously applied for a recount over a deposit and they would certainly lose.

So far ive read there are no less than 3 personal assistants that have been hired to help Stevie and his family adjust to the transition that is living in LA.  The malibu mansion at 20k per week.  A condo at LA Live which is closer to the stadium than malibu (quite a few of our players have these).  As well as the salary, coaching mentality to build around Stevie.

We kind of run a clinic in this league on how to treat Designated Players (for those that dont know, each team is given 4.3 million on salaries for the 28 on the roster with the exception of 3 designated players.  They hit that budget for a bit over 200k each.  The club is responsible for everything above that.

which reminds me I should also probably explain how our league is run.

We're a single entity ownership league.  What that means is the league itself owns all the player contracts.  The ""owners"" are actually franchise owner/operators.  So each owner had to pay a fee (around 100 million these days) to be an ""owner"".  

The upside of this is that for the owners, its a VERY safe investment that guarntees their income and share of the tv royalties as well as most of their business costs.

this is why our pay is super shit compared to BPL.  But it's also why MLS didnt fail in the USA.  It's designed as a business to be a collective trust that every owner can be profitable in regardless of how their attendance/performance is.

this also empowers the league to step in and just take over if you run your team into the ground (this happened to Chivas USA).",null,0,null,1432589274,null,0,false,0,crknkbg,null,t3_378lhz,null,t1_crknkbg,null,t1_crkmfxx,null,null,null,1433262718,null,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4,null

null,false,popidge,null,null,null,"&gt;Who was your player of the season?

Tough one. **Cambiasso** springs to mind just because of his sheer impact on how the team has performed (amazing passing and positioning in games) which has rubbed off on the rest of the team, and inspired them. **Vardy** is another contender for his attacking play. I'm a massive fan of **Jeff Schlupp**, it's so great having a defender who will just pick up the ball in his own half, and suddenly change gear, go on a surging run and get a chance. One of those? 
But then I saw those Squawka ratings. Who's at the top? Who's played the most? Who's *always* been consistently great and an absolute rock? **Wes Morgan**, that's who. Think back. has he ever really had a game where he's not been crucially important? Has he ever actually had a bad game this season? I think he' possibly the most understated captain in the whole of the Premier League. 
I think it says more about LCFC as a club that it's so hard to pick out the standout player - because we're a *team*.

&gt;Did this season meet your expectations?

If the season was a sealed box, and all I saw was us going in promoted as Championship Champions (and by far the strongest team in the Championship), and leaving safe, in 14th, 6 points clear of the drop with a -9 GD? Yes. For sure. It'd be on the upper end of my expectations, but yeah, I'd see that as a real possibility. The manner that we achieved it? The minutiae of our week-to-week league performance? Not a chance. I thought it'd be scrappy win, scrappy loss, drubbing by big team, alright win over Burnley etc. We'd play jump-rope with the 17th/18th split line, and possibly eke it out last day. Instead,we got a full-on roller coaster. A good first couple of games, followed by too long a series of frustrating losses, a painful realisation mid-March that, ""hey, maybe not this time"". Then it happened. The team did what it did at the beginning of last season. It gelled. Things started working. The bright flashes we'd seen eclipsed by painful errors in mid-season games started to come thick and fast. The goals went into our oppponents nets, and were kept out of ours. The training and discipline of our defence became obvious. Our attacking players re-learned thier niche, and the team started to engineer situations where we could use them more. Oh the elation. The sweet bubble of a positive feedback loop. Fans happy, players responding, games won, fans happy. I live down the road from the King Power. A lot of our fellow fans walk past my house to/from the Narborough Road. Every Saturday from April 4th onwards, the smiles got bigger, the anticipation more palpable, the sense of fearlessness growing. That, I did not expect going into the season. 

&gt;What's next for Leicester?

Small changes, big results. Just like the transition from 12/13 to 13/14. We have a team that's worked out how to make the most of it's resources. Confidence is high. Having seen him do it before, I have full faith that Nigel Pearson can make those minuscule changes, can snag that key signing, can refine our strategy and can keep the squad's amazing level of consistency that will push us to a strong, thriving, ""mid-table with European aspirations"" Premier League outfit. 


Shoutouts to /u/lgfualol - every week, you've kept this subreddit going, and you've put in a lot of effort and dedication. What's next for /r/lcfc? I think we could push for some recognition as an LCFC fan community - there's a level of civilisation in this subreddit that you don't get in a lot of football forums. Maybe an AMA from a current/former player? How about an /r/lcfc pre-match meetup? (Probably round my house, it's 5 minutes walk from the KP!)

Also, I have a slight confession to make. I was worried that this coming season would be the year when Wolves and Leicester were back in the same league. I'm a Wolves fan since childhood.

null,false,JohnnyButtocks,scot-orkney,Orkney,null,"&gt;No matter what I say - even if I point out that the other, much larger cult that followed the revolution was The Cult of Reason, which isn't just similar to modern atheism it pretty much is the entire foundation of modern atheism and that the atheists following it committed horrifying crimes against believers despite having absolutely nothing to do with communism - you will always find a way to tell yourself that it had nothing to do with the fact that they were atheists.

Not at all. 

There was of course a big atheistic element to the French Revolution. Where else could you find cause to reject the presumption that some have a god given right to rule or riches? That could only come from a rejection of 18th century French Christianity, one way or another. But that is different entirely to *your* outrageous claim that their atheism inevitably made them bloodthirsty and murderous - a claim which you've never even attempted to justify. You seem to think you can just 

I bring up Robespierre because you're talking about atheistic dictators and leaders. The *architect* and leader of the Reign of Terror was not an atheist (nor were his followers) and he found justification for his actions in god. You can't ignore the fact that the presence of deists at the head of the revolution confounds your claim that atheism was the cause. 

I don't even deny that atheists have committed acts which they couldn't have if they believed in God! My modest claim, which you are apparently scandalised by, is that atheism doesn't inevitably lead to mass murder. You seem content to brush past my reference to peaceful liberal democratically elected atheists, which you had apparently not even heard of.

&gt;Even if I point out that at least three if the five worst mass murderers of all time were atheists, still you will tell yourself that atheism is s movement of reason and peace.

No. I deny that atheism and authoritarian communism are the same movement. That's all. Care to ""debunk"" that? Are you really accusing me of being motivated by the same ideas as Stalin? It's an outrageously insulting, arrogant claim, yet you're the one acting like someone's pissed in your cornflakes.

The way the US did it, with the patriot act, was to simply take away very basic rights in the name of preventing terrorists. One of the most worrisome rights taken away was a right to trial. Any US citizen can be imprisoned indefinitely without trial now, and also denied a lawyer. Searches/confiscations without cause are another one. So long as it's called a terrorism investigation it's fine. There's really quite a few of the basic rights taken away for Americans that are rather frightening. 

To be fair they are not using these laws in normal cases just yet over there, they've only been used with a few actual terrorists. But you are trusting the government to define that term accurately, and they can interpret it however they like, now that it's in place.

At the same time, it sort of pisses in my cereal that the ISIS nuts are happily allowed back into this country at the moment.

The question is where do you draw the line between them and just normal protesters and citizens who have deviant political views from the standard. I really can't help but feel that a line needs to be drawn *somewhere*. Obviously deviant political viewpoints should not be unnecessarily persecuted as a side effect. Really it's a rather challenging question.

Quite curious to see how the new bill plays out. Hopefully it's not done in the same manner as the other side of the pond.

Hi Mr Davies,

Firstly, congratulations on retaining your seat in Swansea West, I was happy to see this, even if I wasn't very pleased with the outcome of the General Election as a whole.

As a member of your constituency, there has been a growing concern with the new Conservative Government.

It has come to my attention that Theresa May is planning to move forward with the Communications Data Bill, which I view as a massive infringement of privacy and civil rights. I was hoping that you will be opposing this bill in Westminster.

My issues with this bill are several fold. Firstly, as a young person in your constituency, I feel that my right to privacy is being eroded more and more. Previously, the Liberal Democrats had prevented this bill from passing, but moments after the BBC announced the likely Conservative win, May announced she fully intended to push it through. Also, Surveillance without oversight is a very dangerous power for a government to have, and as a Computer Scientist, I am not confident that the government can have the necessary oversight or security in order for this to be a leak-proof system.

Further erosion of our right to privacy is a scary prospect for me, and I would love to know your opinion regarding this.

Thank you

We don't have a DoF anymore but Rodgers is working with a transfer committee. This is not ideal, as it seems they can't seem to get an understanding of what kind of players the club really needs. Just look at Balotelli. I refuse to believe Rodgers willingly signed him after a couple of weeks earlier having stated that he won't sign him. Anyone could see that he's not the type of player Rodgers likes, for quite obvious reasons. On the other hand giving Rodgers full control of transfers might not be the best idea either, eg. Joe Allen (even though I personally like him) for 15m. 

As for myself, i'm stuck on a fence between wanting Rodgers to stay or go. He's shown he can get the team to play and get results, just not for the entire season. And if someone new were to come, then who? Klopp is reportedly going to have a 6 month sabbattical, and while I would like Rafa Benitez back I don't think he's take us forward (tried and tested and all that). A new manager would put us into a whole new transition aswell. 

Goals have been the main problem for us this season obviously, and if Sturridge isn't fit and firing next season, this may very well continue unless A. We sign a proper striker who fits our style. B. Coutinho, Henderson et al. start becoming consistent goal threats. or C. Origi has an absolutely beastly first season for us 
Out of these I think A. looks the most likely. 
On the good side, if any of our current strikers stay, they surely can't have worse seasons than what they've had this year.

As for you lot, I don't really see you selling any of the players you mentioned, for similar reasons. And I think the big teams are a bit afraid of paying the massive fee it would take to get Kane after one good season.

While I obviously don't want you guys to get a top 4 spot at our expense, it would be refreshing (and kinda hilarious) if Arsenal were knocked out of there. United can just fuck off.

&gt; I am very concerned about the potential impacts of this bill on innocent individuals across the country.

&gt; I believe the last coalition government was wrong to cut the Prevent programme by £3bn only to justify acts like this in the name of preventing extremism. I think there is a fine balance to be struck between securing our liberty and maintaining a free and fair society on which our liberty also depends.

&gt; I will carefully scrutinise any bill put before me in the House of Commons on this issue, and will oppose any bill which doesn't safeguard and protect the British public from undue laws that restrict free speech. Mass data retention is an extremely controversial issue, one which touches at the very centre of our liberal values, and I can assure you that I will oppose any attempt for a carte blanche intrusion into the private lives of ordinary people across Cambridge.

&gt; We must do more to protect our society from the dangers of an increasingly uncertain world but I think we need to carefully examine all proposals and not rush through laws that undo the foundations on which our tolerant, free and liberal society were built.

&gt; Thank you for raising this with me. I hope this letter sets out where I stand on this extremely important issue.

&gt; Yours Sincerely

&gt; Daniel

That makes absolutely no sense to me. All that changed was to give people a simple and free way of setting up something that they could have done anyway but would have found harder.

The point is, it shouldn't be done at the ISP (etc.) level, everyone should be responsible for their own browsing / online interaction.

I was an LFC supporter first, and was skeptical to start following the LA Galaxy. Especially when I found out that David Beckham the manc was coming over. But through the brilliance of Team USA and MLS legend Landon Donovan in his prime with combination of a not-yet-burnt out Becks, they actually produced some great football for MLS standards and I decided to start supporting on a consistent basis.  
  
With the, albeit gradual, improvement of MLS, the league has grown quite competitive and is actually really a unique brand of football that you dont see anywhere else. Is it the most appealing brand? Definitely not. But it is unique and does have a bit of charm if you allow yourself to accept these arent the world class of the world class players that you see in England, Germany, Spain, Italy.  
  
The LA Galaxy have been far and away the best club at utilizing the designated player rule(Capping the amount of international transfers or what the MLS states as:  
  
""The rule allows each MLS franchise to sign players that would be considered outside of the team's salary cap (either by offering the player higher wages or by paying a transfer fee for the player), allowing MLS teams to compete for star players in the international soccer market.""  
  
Robbie Keane and Stevie G have been the latest Designated Players to come the Galaxy's way. And as someone with all of their family heritage laying in Ireland, and a long time LFC supporter, I feel like I've hit the jackpot. Robbie Keane has been a huge success as he was part of the most devastating trio in MLS history with Keane, Donovan and Beckham in the attack in 2011, and has been the winner of 3 MLS Cups (including the winner of last years final, in LA Galaxys home stadium, Stub Hub Center seen here:  
  
[Robbie Keane Winner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjK7RfXWxGk)  
  
All the unnecessary MLS and LA Galaxy information aside, Im very excited to see him play up close and personal at Stub Hub Center and look forward to leading ACB in the different Steve Gerrard songs and chants. Let me know if you have any questions or would be interested in some Steven Gerrard LA Galaxy updates once he starts playing.

We're on a fast track to being another arsenal. 

They're only expanding the stadium so they can rape the fans some more. 

The manager has consistently had his primary transfer targets snapped up by rival clubs as the team of people paid to identify and recruit new players fails him, time and again he's had to settle for second best. He's also in his first major job and knows if he's sacked it'll probably be his last, hence he's desperate to stick it out.

&gt;

&gt;__Roy of the Rovers__ is a British [comic strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_strip) about the life and times of a fictional [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) named [Roy Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Race), who played for [Melchester Rovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melchester_Rovers). The strip first appeared in the *[Tiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_(Fleetway\))* in 1954, before giving its name to a weekly (and later monthly) [comic magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_magazine), published by [IPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPC_Media) and [Fleetway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetway) from 1976 until 1995, in which it was the main feature.

&gt;The weekly strip ran until 1993, following Roy's playing career until its conclusion after he lost his left foot in a helicopter crash. When the monthly comic was launched later that year the focus switched to Roy's son Rocky, who also played for Melchester. This publication was short-lived, and folded after only 19 issues. The adventures of the Race family were subsequently featured in the monthly *[Match of the Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_of_the_Day)* football magazine, in which father and son were reunited as manager and player respectively. These strips began in 1997 and continued until the magazine's closure in May 2001.

&gt;Football-themed stories were a staple of British comics from the 1950s onwards, and Roy of the Rovers was one of the most popular.  To keep the strip exciting, Melchester was almost every year either competing for major honours or struggling against relegation to a lower division. The strip followed the structure of the football season, thus there were several months each year when there was no football. By far the most common summer storyline saw Melchester touring a fictional country in an exotic part of the world, often South America, where they would invariably be kidnapped and held to ransom. The average reader probably stayed with the comic for only three or four years, therefore storylines were recycled; during the first ten years of his playing career, Roy was kidnapped at least five times.

&gt;The stock media phrase ""real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff"" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.

Especially for 16 year olds who haven't really paid attention to car driving let alone have any experience of it and how the road system works. Picking up the basic controls and so on with a 50cc ped is often easy enough. 

I always used to struggle driving cars. I struggled to pass my car test (after flying through the bike test) I now hold an articulated lorry licence and am a class one police driver (which is the highest category of police driver). Plug away at it, you'll get there! 

There are two elements to driving (and indeed riding). Machine/car control and roadcraft. You've done well enough in the former but need to work on the latter. No surprise there, its the latter which takes time to master. Roadcraft is you sense of planning, anticipation, observation, observation links, knowledge of various systems, like roundabouts and so on. Its also good drills with things like lifesavers. 

Here's what I think you should do. One, read up on the highway code. You can buy a copy for a couple of pounds. Mine has dribble marks on where I've fallen asleep on it enough times but there we are.

null,false,lux_roth_chop,null,null,null,"&gt; My modest claim, which you are apparently scandalised by, is that atheism doesn't inevitably lead to mass murder.

Yet as I've already shown, every single country govered by atheists practising state atheism has descended into inhuman cruelty and presecution, without exception. This has held true throughout history, to the extent that the majority of the worst mass murderers of all time have been atheists. If atheism "" doesn't inevitably lead to mass murder"" then you will need to explain why throughout history it inevitably *has*, every single time atheists have governed a country and made atheism the state position.

Not only is this true, it works from the largest scale all the way to the smallest. If I held up r/atheism as a good example of the predelictions of atheists - an obsessive hatred of religion and a determination to target believers for abuse at every opportunity - you would no doubt claim that this was an outlier, a group of immature, angry young people perhaps, and certainly not representative of atheism. Then if that's the case, where are the groups of well-mannered, compassionate atheists who do not spend their time obsessing over religion and sharing derogatory views about it and about believers? I've been asking atheists this for ove 15 years and not one has provided an example of an atheist community which fits the bill.

The question is simple: if you wish to claim that atheists are reasonable and calm as a group, where are all the groups of reasonable, calm atheists? Nowhere in history; every ruling group of atheists promoting state atheism has descended to mindless savagery. Then what about today? Where are the groups of peaceable atheists who don't obsess and snarl and revel in the very worst behaviour?

One thing that has me excited is that we have players that now have a season of premier league football under their belts. For long parts of the season we had a squad you would call Championship level, but now they look as premier league as most teams.

I also thought the draft Bill gave too much power to the Home Secretary and the Home Office. I will scrutinise this Bill carefully when it is put before Parliament and hold the Home Secretary to account – given the Conservative Manifesto pledge to scrap the Human Rights Act, it is clear we are about to face a serious attack on individual liberties, which, together with my Labour colleagues I will be at the forefront of resisting. In any such Bill, it is vital that there are safeguards and checks in place to protect privacy and to ensure that there are no abuses of power where personal data is concerned.

And the penatly you guys got in the last derby. While admittedly it was a hand ball, it appeared to me to be unintentional and it was also just an inch or two outside of the box but it was given as a penalty.

Edit: I didn't read your thing properly so half of this is irrelevant... sorry. 

I went to my GP with extensive notes/records of the problems I was having and asked for a mental health referral because I suspected I had ADHD. I didn't SAY that to my GP but I did show him my extensive notes. He didn't understand any of what I was trying too communicate but saw there was clearly something so referred me to Cambridge Street House.

After a chat with a doctor there I was tested for ADHD and Aspergers. They decided it was probably ADHD. Ordinarily, they would require statements from parents etc to prove that symptoms has occurred in childhood but my parents aren't alive so they asked for contact details of ANYONE who knew me as a child. I contacted my old childminder and passed  on her details but in the end they never actually contacted her because they decided it was a clear case. I got the diagnoses and am now getting help!

Basically, take notes that demonstrate the problems you have to your GP and ask for a metal health referral. Your GP will go and consult with some other GPs and they will decide whether or not to refer you. If you are struggling then I see no reason why they should say no. Perhaps the a second copy of your notes so you can leave it with them.

Assuming you are referred, the adult mental health people will tell you what to do after that. Not having family context doesn't automatically mean no diagnosis. However, if you are in contact with anyone who was an adult when you were a child, and ego knew you, maybe ask them if you can pass their details on if requested. 

I don't know about online tests. If I were a doctor if be pretty skeptical about that. I chose not to disclose my guess to my GP because I have a history of anxiety and I thought that if I went in and said 'I think I have this.' it would just be put down to anxiety and dismissed. Instead, I wanted to say 'I have these specific problems, they are interfering with my life and I really need help.' I have no idea if that was the right thing to do though.

We trusted several countries to come together and form the European Charter of Human Rights and we trust a non-governmental organisation which has no prior bias to any faction (European court on the human rights) to deliver a fair verdict, where the government is one being taken to court. 

Why should that be removed. 

&gt; It's a matter of sovereignty.

See Sovereignty is about power and its about centeralising power in the government. Human rights is not something that needs centeralising. What it needs to non-bias fair courts and constitution that can be protected even if it against its own government. 

&gt;  You wouldn't understand because you think we should all be one nationality under the EU banner and it bends your mind to discover that not everyone born on the European continent shares your views.

Well firstly it may surprise you that a few years ago I was UKIP supporter so theres that. Secondly the EU protects different nationalites, EU citizenship has nothing to do with nationalities, thirdly the ECHR and the EU are two different things.

Well there are already fringes on the freedom of speech as it is. With the hate crime and with more terror laws allowing people to be held longer without trial and people to surveillance on them there are already cases of people taking the UK to ECHR because of these things. Theresa May has  openly said she wants more control over and wants to push through the snooper chart which I believe is crossing the line. The Lib Dems tried to block it before. 

&gt; You're writing something off before it's been written

The Snooper chart has been written and I disagree with it. 

&gt; By all means, gnash teeth and wail to your hearts content once the damn thing has been written, try and keep a level head between then and now.

I will if you agree to take your shades of and try and see through some stuff being put forward. So far the things the Tories have been saying and doing do not suggest that there proposal actually will give people stronger rights. What the proposal so far suggest is a document, the government cant control better  and the government can change. That's a worry, Human rights should be something the government can't change if it does not like outcomes.

null,false,UK_Democracy,null,null,null,"Most ""controversial"" comment: *Why should we trust an Australian to know what's best for Britain?* Do you think that's anywhere near ""really nasty""?

The next two most ""controversial"" comments are gentle piss-takes, and are both from /u/tusksrus, a self-confessed Blairite. Do you support the SNP? Because I can't see who else would think such a person was a ""right-winger"".

Then: *You disgust me. Your citizens allowance would ruin this country. I hope you realise you have no chance of making any meaningful difference to the country. Why do you guys suck?* I still don't think that qualifies as ""really nasty"", do you? I can certainly think of a lot nastier.

Then: *How will you react to UKIP`s victory?* Sadly inaccurate, but hardly nasty.

Then: *When do you think the UKIP bubble will burst?* That, admittedly, was very, very nasty, but was emphatically not from a ""right-winger"". (Amusingly, the user concerned asked what was not on the surface an unreasonable question during tonight's AMA, but Suzanne ignored it. Maybe she was given a list of trolls' usernames.)

Then: *Will you help end intolerance against Muslims and help bring about Sharia law for the UK?* Now that is certainly a very nasty *idea*, from someone who presumably has very right-wing views about gay people, women, Jews, and possibly black people, but they weren't being nasty simply by asking the question. I'd quite like to have seen Natalie's answer, and it's no surprise that she ducked that question along with most others. (This may actually have been someone just pretending to be an Islamist. It's [hard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law) to distinguish extremism from a parody of extremism.)

Then: *Are you a homosexual?* Juvenile certainly, but still not ""really nasty"" in my book. The poster concerned *does* post other stuff that's nasty, but this was pretty tame by their standards really. If being gay is acceptable then can it really be so awful to ask someone if they are? You can ask me if I'm gay if you want. (Though you can also find the answer in my post history.)

Still, that is probably the ""worst"" one so far, I'll give you that. Still not exactly overwhelmed by all the ""horrid right-wingers being really nasty"" though.

Let's see what's next: *Are you bonkers?* Juvenile, low-effort and borderline nasty, though surely a politician can take such a jibe. The poster concerned is new and has no obvious political affiliation.

And then: *What actions would you take to put a stop to mass surveillance and protect (and enhance) civil liberties?*

*Will the Green Party take any steps to stop political correctness from stifling freedom of speech and freedom of expression?*

Nothing wrong with them. Then: *How would you respond to people who don't view you as a legitimate party as you reject the basic assumptions and measurements that the past 100 years of economic thought have been based on?* I would say that was ""uncomfortable reality"" rather than ""nasty"".

And it is probably much the same point that the ""Are you bonkers?"" poster was trying to make. The Green party *are* bonkers. Their childish policies make *no* sense, wherever one is on the political spectrum. People support them out of emotion. If they received anywhere near the same kind of scrutiny as UKIP then they would simply be torn apart in every interview.

Then: *would you rather fight 100 duck sized horses or 1 horse sized duck?* Silly, not nasty.

Then: *How does it feel to know that to anyone that's done the slightest bit of research, knows that your party is an absolute joke?!?!?!* Possibly nasty, but so, so true.

Then: *Why does your party deserve a place in the UK televised party debates, while (more successful) parties from Northern Ireland do not?* Not nasty, and a perfectly reasonable question.

Then: *Do you 420 blaiz it?* A joke, and not from an obviously ""right-wing"" poster.

I can't really be bothered to go any further. I did what you said and sorted by ""Controversial"", and that AMA does not appear to be ""FULL of horrid right-wingers being really nasty"". In any case, Bennett did not answer *one* of the above questions and probably didn't even read them.

And considering the actual nastiness displayed by some anti-UKIPpers towards UKIP, both online and offline (examples can be provided), it was not unreasonable to think they might try it during the AMA tonight. I am glad they didn't and that it went as well as possibly could have been expected. But in general there is certainly one side which is nastier than the other, and your implication that the nasty side is the ""right-wing"" side is baseless, and not even borne out by the Green Party AMA (and even if it had been, it would have been the exception that proved the rule).",null,0,null,1432597116,null,0,false,0,crkrkz6,null,t3_377w5j,null,t1_crkrkz6,null,t1_crknv46,null,null,null,1433264612,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,Brian,null,null,null,"&gt;Or what about saying no to a 'no to marriage equality' cake

I'd say this would also probably be judged discriminatory, though only on the Fair Employment and Treatment act criteria, rather than the Equality one.  Ie. it likely wouldn't run afoul of the ""sexual orientation"" grounds, but one other aspect is the ""discrimination based on political opinion"" in the FE&amp;T act which the case cited, and it seems this would qualify too.  OTOH, there's a judgement citation stating ""the type of political opinion in question must be one relating to the conduct of the government of the state or matters of public policy"", so while this would work for the ""no to marriage equality"" one, it may not qualify for the ""hitler cake"" example.

&gt;In the Asher's case, the man was not discriminated on because he was gay

The ruling here was that it was still discrimination ""on grounds of sexual orientation"", with the judge citing a case noting that ""grounds"" here didn't just apply to the motive for the judgment, but included factual criteria related to the decision.   There's also the issue that the law forbids both direct discrimination (ie. you're gay, I won't serve you), and indirect discrimination (ie. there is a huge correlation with the type of people who will want to support gay marriage and those who are themselves gay, so discriminating against expressing that message constitutes effective discrimination).  He actually ended up judging it direct discrimination on the grounds that the overlap was sufficiently large (which seems a bit iffy to me, though he also noted that it wouldn't have changed anything if it had only been judged indirect discrimination).

Ie. it isn't just a matter of the customer being discriminated against for *being* gay, but the grounds on which the service he was asking for and its relation to sexual orientation being the means of judgement.  Eg. there's another case cited where a (white) manager was fired for refusing to obey an instruction not to admit black customers.  This was judged to be discriminatory even though it wasn't the person *fired* who was black, but it was still the case that he was treated unfavourably due to racial considerations.  In the same way, it's not neccessary for the customer to be discriminated against for himself being gay, but that the criteria on which the discrimination are done are based on those strongly related to sexual orientation.",null,0,null,1432597641,null,0,false,0,crkrub3,null,t3_3782wq,null,t1_crkrub3,null,t1_crkp47v,null,null,null,1433264734,null,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1,null

So we have: Hitler, UKIP, Anti-Muslim, IRA/UVF and 'Dickhead'.

So, firstly, legality.  

* The anti-Muslim one is hate speech, so illegal.

* IRA/UVF is likely to fall under supporting terrorism and so illegal.

* I believe it's illegal to display a Swastika throughout Europe (except NI, oddly) but I don't think an image of Hitler is illegal.

* Supporting UKIP isn't illegal.

* Having an opinion that someone is a dickhead isn't illegal either.


So we now check if the remaining three are protected by your Human Rights.  

* An image of Hitler isn't protected and could probably be denied.

* Calling someone a dickhead isn't protected and could be denied.

* Supporting UKIP is protected as a **Political Opinion** and so would have to be served.

Do you really need me to answer this?

The reason why most atheists go unnoticed by people like you is because they mind their own business. They don't define their existence and character in terms of their disbelief in a god. They just get on with life. Just like most moderate religious people do. The people that are visible and audible are the noisy attention seeking opinionated arseholes. This is as true of atheists as it is of Christians or Muslims.

&gt;The question is simple: if you wish to claim that atheists are reasonable and calm as a group, where are all the groups of reasonable, calm atheists?

They don't congregate in groups because they don't define themselves according to things they don't believe in. I have religious friends and irreligious friends. I've never considered joining a group which excludes believers. Its just not something I choose friends over. I'm interested in whether someone laughs at the same stuff as me, can make *me* laugh, and is a decent, generous person. That's it.

&gt;every ruling group of atheists promoting state atheism has descended to mindless savagery. 

You dont become an autocratic dictator by being a reasonable moderate person. Its a self selecting group. Also that caveat, ""promoting state atheism"", that's a characteristic which only occurs in violent revolutionary movements which are overthrowing religious dictatorships, so again, murderous purges comes with the territory. How would you like to defend religious revolutionary movements? Can you name a benign one? Do you think Isis is typical of religious people? 'Then where are the moderate religious revolutionaries???' etc.

&gt;Where are the groups of peaceable atheists who don't obsess and snarl and revel in the very worst behaviour?
You're making the claim, where is your evidence?

What percentage of the UK do you think is a non believer? What about Scandinavia? Where are all the snarling reactionary Danes and Swedes?

You haven't presented any evidence. You are throwing a dart and drawing a bullseye around it.

To correct the article who says branches were called 'James Connolly Workers Republican Club in East Belfast' they were simply called 'Connolly Clubs'. The group were aware of the negative connotations the word republican had in NI so used 'Connolly Clubs' as opposed to Republican Congress branch as they were called in the south. Simiarly while their newspaper was self titled in the South it was called 'The Northern Worker' in NI.

There was a clash in Bodenstown between Congress and IRA men the event the article references. It has since become infamous in republican circles as while not motivated by sectarianism its symbolism is undeniable. The northern contingent led the group at Bodenstown which produced [this now famous picture](http://www.wsm.ie/sites/default/files/BreakConnectionCapitalism.jpg) of the 'united irishmen of 1934' as they termed themselves. The two men holding the banner are Jim Straney and Liam Tumilson who would later die in Spain. Them and other members of the group are commemorated in Christie Moore's song Viva la Quinta Brigada. 

Theres two pamphlets on the group written by members that may be of interest to people: [George Gilmore](http://michaelharrison.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/The-Irish-Republican-Congress-George-Gilmore-Historical-Reprints-No-4-Cork-Workers-Club-1974.pdf) [Paddy Byrne](https://cedarlounge.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/ir-rep-cong-94.pdf)

Do you remember how much we paid for Pavlyuchenko? Do you remember how much we paid for Darren Bent? Sergei Rebrov!? Now look at Soldado. Adebayor. Seriously. Good players, not working out somehow.

Kane had only one loan to a PL team, and that was Norwich. He barely ever played. His loan to Millwall wasn't bad. Leicester wasn't outstanding. Yet, he tore it up this season. 

Do you see what I am saying? You can throw cash at it and hope it works, or you can mould a player that hasn't become accustomed to particular traits and get what you need from them.

I've just seen nothing from him to suggest that he can sort out the problems. Sturridge will get injured again and Rodgers has shown no capacity to adapt to that.

null,false,rjtwe,42,Puncheon,null,"**Player of the Season** - Jason Puncheon

**Most Improved** - Glenn Murray. Didn't think he'd be cut out for this level and he's more than proved his worth. 

Zaha deserves a mention too, really think and hope that he pushes on to that next level next year. Would like to see him go to the U21 Euro's as well but I'm not sure why Southgate doesn't fancy him any more.

**The Freddie Sears Award for Most Bitterly Disappointing Player** - 

Didn't have high hopes for Mutch when he joined so I'm excluding him from this. 

I'd have to go for Delaney, think he's vastly overrated and the quality of Scott Dann compared to Danny Gabbidon is really highlighting his flaws. Don't think it's a coincidence that some of our better defensive performances have been without him in the side and I'd be disappointed if his new contract meant Hangeland going who I think is a better player. 

**The Johnny Ertl Award for Most Underrated Player** - Last year and the beginning of this season I would've said Puncheon but since his move centrally he's been getting the recognition he's deserved since he joined us.  

I think Martin Kelly has done a fine job in very difficult circumstances since he joined us. I'd like to see him partner Dann more next year as that is where I think he'll end up playing best. Especially when we have two good full backs in Ward and Souare (who looked a lot better and settled in the last couple of games of the season).

Ledley deserves a shout too. 

**Goal of the Season** - Jedinak versus Liverpool, didn't think he had that in him. Against us is obviously Matt Phillips which was so out of the blue and actually annoyed me cos I wanted a clean sheet.

**High Point of the Season** - Four games that I can't choose from. The November 3-1 win against Liverpool, Pardew's first game in the 2-1 win over Spurs, 2-1 against City and Bolasie's hattrick in the 4-1 win over Sunderland that I still can't really wrap my head around.

**Low Point of the Season** - Losing Pulis just before the start of the season was one of the worst feelings in recent memory only just beaten out by appointing Neil fucking Warnock to replace him. The optimism of the upcoming season immediately wiped out. Thank christ for Pardew.

**The Liverpool Award for Favourite Opponents** - Leicester were played out the park both times this season. The City and Spurs wins were both incredibly satisfying.

**The Yannick Bolasie Award for Favourite Bit of Outrageous Skill** - Bolasie rinsing Lovren for Ledley's goal against Liverpool and him doing [this](http://gfycat.com/LastBareFlounder) to Lovren again. There's been so much little pieces of skill between him and Wilf which is what makes watching us so fun.

**Most Impressive Individual Opposing Player** - Going very on early in the season and saying Downing against us in the 3-1 home defeat. Rolando Aarons was very bright against us in that 3 all draw, bit of a shame he got injured.

When you talk about ""pizza as we know it"", I guess you refer to ""pizza as you know it"". It might sound strange to you but for most people, pizza does not equate to Domino's chewy pie but to the original dish, as sold in Italian pizzerias all over Italy, the rest of Europe and most of the rest of the world, except for North America and sadly Britain.

Spelling mistakes apart, the ""original cheep (sic) dish"" you're referring to is most probably the Panis Focacius that most historians consider the precursor of pizza. It is a fact known to most that Pizza itself is a quintessentially Italian dish, fact that is also officially recognised by the European Union through its Traditional Specialities Guaranteed status. The production real pizza is also standardised since roughly the 17th century and is regulated as you can see here: http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/public/pdf/disciplinare%202008%20UK.pdf

apparently the other thing they fought hard for was having the league pay for lunches on training days which i guess they weren't doing before.

also through this cba term the transportation rules weren't touched so its the same for every team there.  regular flights and buses.  sitting in coach.  charter flights absolutely forbidden.

And it's the measure every country uses, with basically the same methodology, so I don't see how this would make us look better than other countries.

GDP is just supposed to measure all economic activity, and drugs and prostitution are economic activity.

They may want to give lower figures to the EU, but they haven't, have they? They are consistent and use the same GDP statistic even when it harms them, like with the EU.

Adding drugs and prostitution doesn't change growth figures. If it did, logically it would only have an effect in the quarter when they made the changes, and it wouldn't affect the rate of growth after that. But what actually happens is that they apply the changes retrospectively so that the GDP figures are comparable, so it doesn't even overestimate growth in that quarter. 

Bear in mind that economic statistics are mostly produced by the ONS or the OBR, and so are outside the direct control of the government. The ONS have very little incentive to make the figures look better than they actually are.

And if you still think the figures are fiddled, you should explain why you think it isn't happening in other countries.

-Shooting, Defensive work, X-Factor

I'm being harsh on Bentaleb because he has had such a good season. 1 year ago I would have told you that Lamela had by far and away the highest skill cap of anyone on the team. Now I think Bentaleb poses a strong challenge to that title and has the capacity to become a PL best midfielder. 

He has shown himself to not only be very capable against all opposition, but also has shown tantalizing glimpses of something more. His quick trick and flick vs Everton on Sunday a perfect example. Of course, he operates in the double pivot which has failed this season to shield the defence and he must wear some responsibility in that regard (though not as much as Mason). His shooting outside of the national team also leaves much to be desired and to truly kick on he needs to produce a few more of those x-factor moments that we know he is capable of. I want to see Bentaleb break a game open like he did in the drubbing of Newcastle under Sherwood.

null,false,ClitDoctorMD,,Mexico,null,"&gt; Why is abortion still illegal in the Republic? When did contraception stop being illegal? When exactly was it that gay marriage became a thing? Who was responsible for the censorship of ""heretical tomes"" in Ireland?

Its over simplistic to say that these are all church run ventures, its simply a reflection of the morals of the people at any given time in history. A majority of people are still against abortion here with church attendances at an all time low - how do you reconcile that fact with your hypothesis? 

Also in the main Ireland has followed the UK in its policies which only legalised it last year, legalising gay marriage has actually put us as one of the few countries in the world that now allow it and the first to ever do it by public vote.

&gt;Even de Valera recognised the ""special position of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church"" in Ireland.
Special position = reign of Catholicism [as a Religion] takings its dogmatic views from the Bishop of Rome.

If you actually study the writing of the constitution you'll realise that you're interrupting this wrongly. The Jesuits led by John Charles McQuaid pushed heavily to have Catholicism installed as the offically state religion, something that was common at the time (Italy had done so in 1929 for example). Instead DeV meet with all church leaders, COI, Catholic and Jewish in consulting what role he should place religion in in the constitution. 

As such recognising the special position of the church rather than making it the official religion was something the Irish church were furious with, Pope Pius meanwhile was asked what his opinion by the Irish government with the response being he didnt have any opinions on the issue either way.

Indeed the following line in the constitution also recognised the role played by minority religions such as 'The Church of Ireland, Presbyterian Church, Methodist Church, Religious Society of Friends, and Jewish Communities'. This amendment was something non of the minorities had asked for and indeed was not something they expect. 

So in this context of DeV refusing to make Catholicism a state religion and recognising minority religions it actually serves to disprove your argument.

&gt;I don't understand what your not getting. 

I get it, I have a degree in History and Politics and am currently doing an MA in History and have written a 30,000 word thesis on the era.

&gt;The Catholic church has been a dominating force in Ireland - so much so that people went to another country to fight for fascists based on their religious beliefs.

People from every country went to spain to fight for religion as they saw it, from Italy, Britain, France, Germany etc. It wasnt a unique phenomena to Ireland rather the whole civil war was framed from a PR perspective as a modern 'crusade'.",null,0,null,1432603933,null,0,1432604958,0,crkv5mo,null,t3_377kxf,null,t1_crkv5mo,null,t1_crku4q7,null,null,null,1433266365,null,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3,null

null,false,BestTaricNA,null,null,null,"I'd give rose an **8** for a couple of reasons-

1) Rose was arguably our most consistent defender throughout the season. Kyle Walker was injured for the majority of the season, when he played he was good but inconsistent. Vertonghen was generally good but was prone to errors that cost us games or points on multiple occasions, still a great centre back but too many mistakes. Dier was good but occasionally his youth showed (e.g. vs united when he let Rooney go right through him without even trying to foul him), in the future I back him to be our best defender but again his youth showed this season. Outside of those 3 None of our other defenders really have a chance of being rated higher then Rose. He consistently made great challenges that saved us from poor situations. He wasn't mistake free but made seemingly fewer than the rest of the back 4. His final ball wasn't great but I would say it was better than walker's and led to a couple nice goals (e.g. Chadli vs Swansea). Finally he scored 3 goals for us this season, looking back on the importance of those 3 goals, it really shows his improvement from last year.

- First Goal *vs Chelsea* this one gave us the lead and I think truly gave us the belief, this was a game we could get 3 from. He also ran right at the ball for this one giving no mind to the impending tackle.

- Second Goal *vs West Ham* this was arguably his most important. Leading up to this goal we were 2-0 down and to be frank, we looked toothless. We had opportunities here and there but nothing that looked to really get us in the game, this goal gave us hope and pushed the team forward to eventually salvage one point. 

- Third Goal *vs Hull* I wasn't watching this game, but from the replay truly was a sensational goal that summed up his improvement in one play, not much more to be said.

2) Second was his improvement not only from last season but even our rough patch in form in the september/october period. I noticed no so much here but on facebook among other places that many people wanted him benched and frankly as far from the side as possible after games like the City one. Since then he has become stronger at the back and going forward. He went from being a scapegoat and one of the weakest members of our side to a staple in it. In fact he earned multiple man of the matches from this sub during our spring rough patch and deservedly so, he was our strongest player for a stretch of 3 or 4 games.

Always supported Nigel even when we were bottom.  Thought he'd be the best manager for us if relegated, and as it turns out, the best manager for us in the Premier League.

To answer your questions:

1.  Obviously, Cambiasso stands out for player of the season for everyone, but I would argue that the Kasper's return was a really be boost for the squad.  I don't think it is a coincidence we started getting results again once he was back in goal.

2.  Our final place in the table definitely exceeded my expectations.  I did expect to fight for our place in the league, which we did up until last week, so I was prepared for the fight.  Never could have written the script for how we did it, though.

3.  I think our ambition for next season would be to establish ourselves as a solid mid-table team.  No more sweating a relegation battle, similar to what Palace did this season.  We need to buy a center back (Huth if possible), two central midfielders to cover for Matty James' injury and Cambiasso's possible departure, and another striker because Ulloa has not convinced me we can rely on him through the course of the season.

Telegraph is reporting that Falcao wants to come to Chelsea and would accept a pay-cut to under £200,000 per week to do so.

I'm kind of torn personally. On the one hand I'm really not sure about Falcao and that is still a lot of money in salary. On the other, there's still the potential for him to recover some of his old form, he'd be fitting in alongside players he's played with before which could make things easier and he's still a physical presence who could hold up the ball like Drogba was and so could fit into the team in that role even if he wasn't a prolific goalscorer.

null,false,SleepingFish,null,null,null,"I feel this is slightly unfair. Forget inflation. Look at the squads each manager started with.

When Rafa joined we had just finished 4th, poor cup runs and Drogba inspired Marseille to beat us in the Europa league. He joined a squad of Dudek, Hyypia, Riise, Carra, Murphy, Hamann, Baros, Diouf, Kewell, Gerrard and Owen, with Cisse on the way. He only really made two signings that made a difference that year, Alonso and Garcia. And let Owen and Murphy go. It's not a champions league winning squad quality (on paper) but it still was littered with some class.

The season before Rodgers joined we had just finished 8th, although had two good domestic cup runs, winning one. The squad was aging and had high wages. Doni (32 and 60k reportedly), Reina (29 and 90k?), Aurelio (32), Agger (65k?), Carra (33), Gerrard (31 and 120k+?), Maxi (30 and high wages), Downing, Carroll and Adams (high wages), Kuyt (31 and 75k+), Bellamy (32 and high wages). Not to mention that Aquilaini and Joe Cole were on extortionate wages and were out on loan. Jay Spearing was even a regular, making 25 appearances for Kenny! 

[talksport](http://talksport.com/magazine/features/130421/how-much-wages-cost-premier-leagues-top-seven-201112-195906) said 70% of our turnover was spent on wages, with [25% of our wage budget spent on 6 players!!](http://basstunedtored.com/2012/06/06/liverpools-wasted-wages/)

Rodgers made 5 signings when he came and two were in Jan (Borini, Allen, Assaidi, Coutinho, Studge).  He got rid of 8. (Aurelio, Kuyt, Maxi, Aquilani, Cole, Adams, Bellamy, Doni) whilst loaning out Spearing and Carroll. None of his signings will have demanded big wages, it's clear this was a case of clear out the dead wood, something Benitez never had to do. 

Now inflation, within football this has been extortionate, and someone else has mentioned it already; no way would Rafa only spend £13m on av per season now. It'd be closer to £30m, easily.

Part of the reason he's so succesfull at attacking in u21 is his physicality, but that doesn't work in the premier league. However, his physicality at CDM does work and helps him a lot more. 

Matic is acctually very good at starting attacks when he needs to, and I think RLC can use his experience of being a bit more attacking to do that to.

But if the consitution was being truly based on the rule of man and Republic - why give special position of the Roman Catholic Church at all? Why not just allow freedom of religion and leave it at that? I would suggest because it would have offended the sensibilities of Catholics to not do so and was a form of appeasement to a vast majority of people who designate as Catholic.

Pretty harsh blashemy laws in the 30s [again not unique - but I didn't say religious fervour was unique to Ireland - just that it existed, exists, and is slowly eroding].

I would argue that the morals of the people in a country where 90 odd percent of the people then, and 80 odd percent now, designate themselves as Catholic generally come from that religion and teachings of their generally religious parents, teacher, friends, clergy and so forth. I know morals are not necessarily religious ones - but how could such ignorance, fear and misinformation exist without religion? Its hardly that the Irish were holding on scientific, or rational principles in continuing to have morals that coincide with the majority religion in the country.

Religious throwbacks and misinformation can persist for a long time after actual belief begins to dissipate. Mainly because tradition is an easy thing to follow. I know people who go throught the ringmarole of attending a church for a period simply so they can be married in it - probably to appease their parents - and continue to have their children Christened and Baptised - and yet never go near a church after those traditions are fulfilled and don't act in a manner compliant with someone of a religion. 

There have been numerous polls recently that show a move away from Irish people being completely against abortion and it being used in certain circumstances such as rape, danger to the mother, etc. Again, probably because the church is losing its hold on people and science and rationalism are more prevalent. 

Books like Catcher in the Rye, Borstal Boys, Lonely Girl - banned - the two latter because of the church involvement. In 1930 onwards numerous books dealing with sex and marriage were banned. Why would that be, in a Republic? What other force would be suppressing free thought on sex, marriage and procreation if not a religion? Don't mention China - that's a cult of personality close enough to religion. 

I'm not saying its a uniquely Irish thing. I'm just saying Catholicism played a massive part in it especially during the 1930s in Ireland - hence reign. And it continues to do so for quite a lot of people. Church attendance may be falling but the number of people who say they are Catholic is still the vast majority of the population. 

I haven't delved into the Spanish Civil War in a good while - and you've put forwad some compelling arguments, and fuck me you've written 30k on it which is more than I ever did. 

I just think it stands out that the Irish fascists fought for Catholicism - while most other parties fought for a politically ideological reasons, be they fascist, communist, anarchist, liberal, republican, et al. 

The communists and anarchists didn't perpetrate the red terror for a God - they did it because a God is the antithesis of their political ideology. And those men and women of God were actively helping the nationalists on quite a few occasions. I don't think the Irish who fought in the International Brigades were doing it for religion - but the Irish Brigade definitely were. 

Anyhow - its been fun and I will agree I was being a tad overly simplistic but I still maintain the Roman Catholic Church has had a massive influence on Ireland and shaped many of the opinions and ideologies that have lead to some heinous crimes and misdemenors in a republic. 

I'm just jealous religious fervour is dissipating more quickly south of the border than north. ",null,0,null,1432607939,null,0,false,0,crkxi60,null,t3_377kxf,null,t1_crkxi60,null,t1_crkv5mo,null,null,null,1433267472,null,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3,null

The point is that when taking the decision to close down an entire industry which is in many areas the hub of the local economy (and the only reason for a town or village existing there at all), you need to make some provision for the population's subsequent employment.

Wilson came back with a set of superficial amendments, and had to deal with euro-sceptics in his cabinet. 

The only major difference, so far as I see, is the fact Heath's government entered Europe &amp; Wilson was able to call a referendum as soon as he was elected- before the euro-sceptics could gather momentum.

He's still flawed, no doubt. But he's only 23 years old and if he continues to improve at the rate he has this season, then he'll get rid of his problems in no time. And its no surprise that Poch favors him as he fits his system almost too well. He just needs to improve on his decision-making and his positioning.

null,false,landoindisguise,null,null,null,"&gt;Keeping on the subject of Sterling, why is it okay to demand he shows loyalty to Liverpool FC and sign a new contract, when everyone is demanding the sacking of a manager who almost led us to our first ever Premier League title last year?

No one is demanding this. What people are upset about:

1. The way he, or his agent, have gone about the contract negotiations so publicly, making both himself and the club look bad in the process.

2. The fact that his wage demands are so out of sync with his performance. He is playing like a promising young player (good in flashes but inconsistent) and demanding to be paid like an established star in his prime. Can't fault him for asking, I suppose, but we can fault him for dragging out everything into a massive public fight with the club when he was refused. 

&gt;You want Liverpool to attract world class players, but any world class players are going to be courted by teams like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United and Chelsea, who all offer a more attractive deal. 

True. But part of what makes ALL of those clubs more attractive than Liverpool? The prospect of playing for an established, widely-respected manager. Even if Liverpool had the money to outbid Chelsea, we'd still be losing out on big talents because they'd prefer to play for Mourinho given his history. 

That said, your broader point is true. Much as I love the sport, in its current state it is predictably boring. The richest clubs will win every. single. year.
