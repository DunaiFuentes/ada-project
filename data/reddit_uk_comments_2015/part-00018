From my experience, some companies worked by giving you free accommodation in Edinburgh (and a little money) for flyering, whilst others paid per hour. As an added benefit, as a member of the 'street team' you usually get a pass to venues any show you are promoting is in. For example, if you're flyering a comedian who is at the Pleasance, you will get a Pleasance pass allowing you into any Pleasance show for free (as long as it isn't sold out. I once had an insane debate with someone where a girl and her friend, one pass and one ticket, were told there was no space for pass-holders. The girl with the ticket left, as her friend wouldn't get in. I asked if I could have her seat, since she wouldn't be using it. The woman said the show was sold out. I pointed out there was at least one unfilled seat, that I could fill. We went back and forth on this until obdurate ignorance bore out, and I left muttering ""but where would she have sat?"". Not that I bear a grudge over it). The same holds for other venues - a relatively common question amongst flyerers was ""Which passes do you have?"".

Anyways, the point is most people are paid per hour, or in housing, not per flyer. Obviously though, most flyerers are promoting their own, or a friend's, show. However my experience is strictly limited to comedy - it may well be different with theatre.

- **Rose** at LW didn't really work. He did score but the game was crying out for a winger/chadli to come on. We were extremely right/townsend heavy (not that it wasn't working!)

- The **Kaboul** situation: He was genuinely dreadful, falling out with a number of players across the game (Jan, Vorm and others). There was a moment in particular where him and Jan kicked off...the crowd (1882 primarily) responded by singing ""Super, Super Jan"". It was clear who they were siding with and rightly so. His days certainly seem numbered. The crowd around me in West upper completely agreed with what the South stand did.

- **Soldado**, feel so sorry for the guy. The miss was as bad as it sounds literally in dead centre in front of the goal and needed a tap in from I would say even *less* than 5 yards. Somehow it rocketed up off the cross bar. But regardless he didn't have a bad game the 2 assists were genuinely well worked. 

- **Townsend** had an incredible game and made some cracking crosses/passes (I know!), I think there was only 1 or 2 shots from him all game. I would go to say it was the most un-selfish and best game I have seen from him in a long time.

- **Capoue** bossed the DM spot nicely, was very solid and I personally feel like his passing range is criminally underrated. The guy can pick out a great ball. 

- **Onomah** (pretty sure I spelt that wrong) didn't really get to do much. Few touches and few decent passes but no where near enough time or involvement to judge. 

- **Chadli** looked excellent once he came on and was surprised he didn't bag a goal, his dribbling was on a whole 'nother level tonight. He wasn't just cutting in either and was regularly getting down the line into the box. Hopefully there are some highlights.

- Where has this **Paulinho** been? (and don't say on the bench!). I lost count the amount of times he was so strong on the ball, shielding it and playing it out like we've seen Ade do when he was in form. Passing was great, his awareness and typical brazilian flare was very good to watch. Some lovely pirouettes and flicks past players.  

- **Stambouli** was nothing special but nothing bad. He played well but that's about all I can say.

- My **MotM**: Would have to be a toss up between Paul and Townsend. Honourable mentions to Capoue and Chadli. ",null,0,null,1421277464,null,0,1421277819,0,cnp7ejk,null,t3_2sg3di,null,t1_cnp7ejk,null,t3_2sg3di,null,null,null,1424872988,null,26,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,26,null

I would have to be not even remotely aware of what was going on to 1 - walk near a canal in that state, and 2 sleep/fall in. In my opinion anyone walking next to a canal is relatively confident doing so, even if they've had a few.

There's a good quote from this article...

http://rt.com/uk/222655-serial-killer-manchester-canals/

""There’s lots of canals in London, Nottingham and Birmingham where there are lots of pubs by the canals and we don’t have a fraction of the number of bodies in the canals that we’ve seen in Manchester.""

Obviously it's possible for people to drown in canals, it's just the frequency of it happening is worth taking note. I think on the off chance that there is someone it's worth taking seriously.

also, tactically his role would be much, much different if he was in a withdrawn position from the beginning. a striker coming deep vs a midfielder trying to play the ball forward. yeah, good one.

the fact that he happens to be a good passer for a striker, you lot seriously want to try and move someone who obviously can't handle the english game in to an unfamiliar position, against more mobile opposition, because he has lost his knack for scoring goals.

He did start shaky, but once he became familiar with his defenders he became one of the greatest players to play at our club. 

He is excellent at stopping one-on-one opportunities, as well as commanding his defence. He can pick out a pass perfectly 99% of the time, be it with his long range throws up the field, or his quick kicks up the field to spark a counter attack. 

While he may take a while to settle, he could very well be an excellent signing once he settles. He really does have the potential, especially after winning GK of the Year in Belgium in just one season after joining.

Townsend I had faith in for so long, then I gave up hope a bit.  He's really come out of the blocks well in recent weeks though, making me think Poch has been able to work with him.  I really don't think he's worse talent-wise than Jay Rodriguez, so I'm hoping that Poch can work his magic and get Townsend firing.

Paulinho I was clamouring to get rid of even last season, but I have thought he's been given the least amount of opportunities under Poch out of all our CMs.  Glad to hear he did well.

Roma president James Pallotta has admitted Liverpool have shown interest in signing midfielder Miralem Pjanic but it would take a huge sum to tempt the club to sell. 

He told Bleacher Report: “We’re businessmen. If someone comes in with a stupid number for a player, you have to listen to it. You can’t just say no, no matter what.

“The Liverpool thing with Pjanic is the same. We have another four years with him, and we love him.”

null,false,joaommx,dundeeutd,,null,"Short term:

Well, it's a bit tricky to tell. Next weekend he might make his debut on the Primeira Liga since Adrien Silva is out on yellow cards and his backup André Martins is injured. We'll start William Carvalho and João Mário, and the third spot in the midfield will go to either Gauld, Wallyson or Slavchev. Of the three Gauld is the most unlike Adrien, but he's the one who has played the most and best on the League Cup. Alternatively, our manager might decide to try a 4-4-2 and start an extra forward instead of a midfielder - he's done it before pairing up Montero and Slimani - but Slimani is playing the CAN right now so this solution might be a bit more unlikely. I think Gauld will at least be on the bench for the weekend.

Medium term:

He's still probably going to start the rest of the games on the League Cup though. We have two more this month, both against Primeira Liga teams - Setúbal and Belenenses - and after that the Europa League returns so we might have to rotate our starters a bit more.

I would say that during the next two or three months he might get several chances to play for the first team, not only on the League Cup, but also on the Primeira Liga. Depending on how he responds to that he might win some space from his competition.

Whenever he's not playing on the first team though, I expect him to start for the B team. Take Ricardo Esgaio for instance, another young player in a similar position. He's our backup right back (and also a depth winger) and started several times for the first team this season, including the away games at Benfica and Chelsea. But whenever the first choice rightback is available Esgaio starts for the B team instead.

Long term:

Having said all that, I would expect Gauld to play at least a handfull more of competitive games for the first team this season, and at most have a few streaks of several games for the first team. Next season I expect him to be higher up on the depth charts, competing for a starting spot, a bit like [João Mário](http://www.zerozero.pt/jogador.php?epoca_id=144&amp;id=56560&amp;op=zoomstats&amp;tpstats=club) or [Carlos Mané](http://www.zerozero.pt/jogador.php?epoca_id=144&amp;id=74340&amp;op=zoomstats&amp;tpstats=club) this season.",null,0,null,1421279095,null,0,false,0,cnp8bzc,null,t3_2sg6x2,null,t1_cnp8bzc,null,t1_cnp6w85,null,null,null,1424872554,null,8,false,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,8,null

To be honest, even for Oxford they're fine. People go on about how important GCSEs are for Oxford (less so for Cambridge) and whilst it's obviously useful to have good GCSEs (bearing in mind the average candidate will have &gt;6A*s) it is definitely possible to get in with less. I know somebody who got into Oxford this year with mainly Bs and Cs at GCSE. The reason why so many people have heaps of A*s at GCSE at these top places is correlative - the people who get the best GCSE results are also more likely to be the kind of people who are generally academically strong. Particularly with Oxford and Cambridge, the critical part is the interview and any aptitude tests you sit (although for Cambridge, your AS UMS is also very important).

Davo will always put in a defensive shift, even on the wing, but Elia/Long/Pelle may be a bit too attacking, as Long is really the only one there who we can count on to track back. Putting JWP and Reed as our only DMs is a bit suspect too, though Reed did do really well against Everton.

Saudi are an absolutely disgusting country on pretty much every level. Backwards in almost every way. Plain out evil really. And it's very likely that they have funded terrorism too. And they certainly promote and fund the spread of their extremist religion.

Yet we MUST have strong involvement with the Middle East because of oil from Saudi and gas from Qatar (another disgusting country). We have vested interests in not letting others (like Russia) get too much access, and vested interests in maintaining Western-""friendly"" governments there who will keep selling to us.

If we were energy independent, we wouldn't need the middle east at all. We can just ignore them, or treat them like African countries. When there's a massacre, or political instability or terrorism in an African nation we go ""oh, that's bad. Stop it guys."" We don't spend £BNs fighting it, fiddling around with their governments and making the entire region hate us.

And now we're falling for this whole ""cheap oil prices"" thing, which is blatant market manipulation. It will kill off green energy investment, since rising oil prices is the main driver of alternative energy sources.

IMO we should use everything we can to become energy independent. We do have gas reserves that we can frack in the short term. And we can do more with wind, solar and nuclear.

Based only on personal experience, I would somewhat share the idea that the holocaust card does get a bit overplayed at times.
I took part in something called 'Lessons from Auschwitz' run by Holocaust Education Society when I was 16. It involved a series of group workshops and presentations, with a one day trip to Auschwitz and Birkenau too.

As horrific as the camps and the history of it was, the way the HES handled the whole event left a sour taste in my mouth. They glossed over much of the actual History of the period while drilling into us the 'doomed to repeat it quote' over and over again.

The follow-up conference after the trip featured a guest speaker who was actually a Holocaust survivor. He recounted his horrific tale and then somehow managed to turn the thing into a Pro-Israel rally. He literally stood on stage and screamed at a bunch of 16 and 17 year olds about how they would never take his country and how it would crush its enemies and what not.

It went way beyond his remit and that of what the project was supposedly trying to achieve and I wouldn't be surprised to hear he'd had previous form, given that he was a speaker on the circuit.

My ex and a close friend at uni did the same project in other parts of the country and had a similar sentiment.

&gt;That case is straightforward. Since these are the images the gunmen wanted to stop, the surviving free press is obliged to deny the killers that victory. No other gesture can show that we refuse to be cowed by their crime. By repeating Charlie Hebdo’s action, we would demonstrate our resistance to the edict the terrorists sought to enforce on pain of death. We show that Charlie Hebdo was not alone.

&gt;There is an appealing simplicity to that stance, but it rests on faulty logic. The key point is this: support for a magazine’s inalienable right to make its own editorial judgments does not commit you to echo or amplify those judgments. Put another way, defending the right of someone to say whatever they like does not oblige you to repeat their words.

This sub loves the youth (I'm definitely in that number) and ""building something for the future"" but at the same time has some sort of strange Stockholm Syndrome for Soldado.  Why, after all this time, do we not only expect him to succeed, but to succeed out of position when real playmakers struggled under Poch in their first few games? Why is it that we want to give every freedom to Poch and try to make sense of his decisions, but can't let go of a failed striker?

It's a heck of a lot better than fossil fuel alternatives - and if we were in a situation where we literally had to choose between the two then nuclear would be a good option - but it's still not 'Green'. A lot of young environmentalists are heralding nuclear power as the solution to all of the world's problems because they don't see any other alternative options to decarbonise the energy system, but it's actually completely possible. Germany and the Netherlands are both doing a brilliant job in terms of renewables and numerous studies have shown that it's possible to completely convert to renewables in a few decades. This model is based on community ownership of power (in which local renewable power structures directly feed into local communities, thereby providing them with a benefit rather than large corporations) but precisely because of this, it is being vehemently attacked by energy corporations that are branding themselves as 'green' such as EDF, who would lose out in that case. Of course in Germany you now have the issue with lignite-dependency but with the rate of increase in the popularity of renewables there, I think this is only a very temporary problem.

**Women's Prisons** (Nothing to suggest a lack of a ""fair trial"")
&gt; CJ381 Recognising the nature of the female prison population, with high levels of mental illness, experience of being a victim of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence, and caring responsibilities for children, the only women who should be in custody are those very few that commit serious and violent crimes and who present a threat to the public.

&gt;CJ382 For the vast majority of women in the criminal justice system, solutions in the community are more appropriate. Community sentences must be designed to take account of women’s particular vulnerabilities and domestic and childcare commitments. The restrictions placed on sentencers around breaches of community orders must be made more flexible.

&gt;CJ383 Existing women’s prisons should be replaced with suitable geographically dispersed, small, multi-functional custodial centres. More supported accommodation should be provided for women on release to break the cycle of repeat offending and custody.

**Community and worker stakeholding in businesses**
&gt;EC650 The unaccountable exercise of economic power by large corporations has done much to destroy the environment and convivial social structures. Green policies will establish greater community and environmental accountability.

&gt;EC651 Smaller and more democratically structured enterprises are more open to community regulation, ensuring that greater care is taken both of the people who work in them, and of the concerns and needs of the local community and the environment. These forms of organisation will be promoted and encouraged by economic legislation. Changes in Company Law, taxation, and in monopolies and mergers legislation, will reduce the size of inappropriately large companies.

&gt;EC652 The right of the shareholders to dividends must not be the single most important criterion for company policy making. Those with a stake in the company's decisions must have the right to make informed input into those decisions. These 'stakeholders' include the share holders, the workers, consumers, the local community and advocates for the local environment. New legal and institutional structures will be created to enable these stakeholders to have a voice in the running of companies and other relevant organisations.

**Non-Racially Segregated Migration Policy**
&gt;MG205 Migration policies should not discriminate directly on grounds of race, colour, religion, political belief, disability, sex or sexual orientation. Preference should not be given to those with resources or desirable skills.

**Amnesty for migrants**
&gt;MG405 Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety.

**Nationality** (Not ""values and culture"")
&gt;NY300 We will work to create a world of global inter-responsibility in which the concept of a 'British national' is irrelevant and outdated.

**Threat of UK Invasion** (The Falklands are a British Overseas Territory and therefore not part of the United Kingdom)
&gt;PD102 The United Kingdom has not been under significant threat of armed invasion since 1941 and such an event is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future.

**Scale and purpose of our Armed Forces**
&gt;PD302 On inspection, there is little or no threat of direct invasion of the UK by any nation. Commitment to a large standing army, a navy of large warships around our coastline, squadrons of fighter planes and a cripplingly expensive missile defence system is therefore unnecessary. Any threat of invasion that might arise in the future is so remote that realignment of the UK military and defence preparations would be possible long before any invasion occurred.

**Nuclear Disarmament**
&gt;PD303 Similarly, the unhelpful and aggressive concept of nuclear deterrence (with the inherent dangers of handling concentrated radioactive substances) is also redundant. As such, immediate nuclear disarmament would be a priority of a Green Government.

Yes there are more lefty comedians but I think that's a consequence of the rise of Alternative comedy in the 80s which was a reaction to the conservative establishment and old comedy of racist and mother-in-law jokes.

That means you won't be able to reinstall anything until that is replaced. If the laptop is still under warranty then I would return it for repair by the manufacturer. 

If not, you'll need to buy a new 2.5 inch HDD, or if your looking for an upgrade go for an ssd, although this will be much more expensive per gigabyte. You can pick up either of these from Amazon cheaply. If you don't know how to replace the HDD then YouTube will be your best place for a guide. I suggest something like Linus tech tips. They will also have a video on how to install windows again, and as somebody else has mentioned, you will either need to get hold of a CD or bootable flash drive and use the code on the base of the laptop (on the windows sticker). Depending on the laptop you will either need the 32 or 64 bit version, but if its a younger laptop it will likely be 64bit. 

This may sound fairly complex, but is actually fairly straightforward, but if its not something your comfortable with then take it to a shop. They shouldn't charge too much, and is no more than about 1.5 to 2 hrs work, plus the cost of the hardware. Good luck

Then Stefan Šćepović, yes he had a good record in the Spanish second division but why did he just move there? At Partizan in the one season he was there he scored 8 goals in 25 games which wasn't good enough so they loaned him to Ashdod in Israel which is a step down and did better with 6 goals in 13 games.

That brought in the interest of Sporting de Gijón who signed him for £800,000. Although it's a move to Spain it's a step down, not the kind of move you want to make at the age of 23.

In one season his value more than tripled. There is no problem with signing players from lower leagues or players who have only been doing well for a year or two. But they should have a good reason why there are in that position, otherwise it's a risky buy.

- Wanyama was young and had work permit issues, he never played at Celtic's level before and never failed the meet expectations at the lower levels. ""He was still trying to find his level and was looking up"".

- Šćepović was older, was free to play wherever he wanted to but had previously failed the meet expectations and was forced to step down a league to secure first team football. ""He found his level after looking down"".

Smith always felt kind of like he had this childlike sense of wonder, and he was always jumping right into things the way a kid might chase a ball into the street when a car is coming. He needed someone to parent him, almost. And that's why Amy and Rory were perfect for him. The significance of Clara is that she's very down-to-earth and full of spunk, which is gratuitous because Matt Smith already has those qualities. But then you have Capaldi, who is more alien-like than any of the previous 3 Doctors, being very stern and aloof, and Clara is the mellowness that balances him out. The moment it crystallized for me was at the end of Into the Dalek, when they're having their little moment and the Doctor says ""I think you're a pretty good teacher,"" and Clara says ""I think I'd better be."" And that was when I realized that Clara represented the humanness that the Doctor was missing, and she became imperative to his well-being.

Anyway, at risk of downvotes, many people on this subreddit were first exposed to, and fell in love with, RTD's more soap-opera-ish take on Doctor Who, and assumed that's what Doctor Who has always been like. Thus when Steven Moffat succeeded RTD as showrunner, many nuWho fans were upset when he discarded the soap elements, technobabble solutions, and primary focus on 'monster of the week' episodes over series arcs in favour of a more myth-arc heavy flavour of writing, which – ironically – is actually closer to the Classic Series in many respects.

I'm not saying that's the case for everyone, but I remember seeing polling data a while back that suggested that people who'd watched the classic series and/or listened to Big Finish Doctor Who tended to favour Moffat significantly more than people who'd only watched RTD-era Doctor Who before Moffat.

Personally, I prefer Moffat, but neither writer is without their flaws – Moffat sometimes overextends himself and often relies on certain character archetypes a bit much, amongst other things, and RTD often relied on lowest-common-denominator humour, technobabble, and ass-pull Deus Ex Machina endings a bit much.

The multi-episode story arcs are haphazard at best, banal at worst.  The Missy reveal was terrible, very American (spelling it out in the most painful way possible, to make sure even the lowest IQ can grasp it).  

The 'boyfriend arc' theme going on pretty much since the reboot has been completely disheartening also.  Is the Doctor the boyfriend?  Are they going to leave their boyfriend?  Boyfriend boyfriend boyfriend.  It's monotonous.

It's like the writers are so far up themselves that they can't coordinate to actually write a contiguous storyline.  The closest is the whole ""discovering himself"" bent they're been on lately, but it's so neuter, so dispassionate, so colourless.  Situations just plonk themselves in front of the Doctor and Clara and the Doctor reacts arbitrarily, only to solve the problem through deus ex machina, survive through chance, or just plain happy accident.  It's boring, banal, stupid - three things the Doctor isn't.

Every episode, we wait for the Doctor to say ""Stupid, stupid, stupid"" and have his Eureka moment, then solve the problem in a way that is totally out of character, driving angst with Clara, then have a dust-up, or make amends.  FFS *House* had better arcs, and House M.D. was practically the 12th.

Jimmy, especially, is missing something crucial for a truly great comedian in that he is a bit like a brick wall- I don't know what he really thinks. He's just a good joke-teller- he's really more suited to the panel shows he's ended up on rather than stand-up. I think that was probably always his aim. To me, he's not a stand-up comedian at all. 

In a way, it's almost beyond simple left and right- two of my favourite American comics, George Carlin and Doug Stanhope, could be more closely allied to 'question everything' rather than simple left and right. George was definitely everything but right wing, but it's hard to place him. Doug is probably somewhere between anarchist/left libertarian/nihilist.

I'm just going to flat out disagree with this. If you can't get the ball under control in tight situations, you won't be able to move the ball quickly and link up play. His control's not up to scratch (which is more the word I was looking for rather than dribbling, but that is also important) and he will never make it as a CAM. I wouldn't normally say never, but I will here because it's an easy prediction for me to make.

true, but only if our manager plays him in another role, if it's clear he is not playing up top and is instead supporting our other attacker then I will judge him on that role. But he wasn't today.

null,false,rydleo,null,null,null,"I would agree that Mario has more natural ability than either, but it doesn't matter how much talent someone has if they have no focus or ability to turn that talent into something useful on the pitch.  Do I think Mario is a better player (generically) than say Borini?  Yes.  Would I rather have Mario on the pitch rather than Borini?  Probably not or at least it's not nearly as much of a slam dunk as it seems.  Why?  Because he's massively wasteful and doesn't play as part of the team.    

Last season in Serie A he took 152 shots and scored only 7 from open play.  He took 95 from outside the box and scored only 2 from open play.  This season for us he's taken 47 shots, 25 of which were outside the area, and scored 0.  By comparison, Raheem has played 1,000 minutes more and taken 3 more shots than him, Coutinho has played 600 minutes more and taken 3 less than Balotelli.  

Balotelli also doesn't create many chances for others (5 total in the league in 752 minutes).  Borini has created 3 more than Mario despite playing 500 minutes less and nearly equaled his total in a single game.  Even Lambert has created more chances playing 200 minutes less.  Sterling has created 49 chances and has 4 assists (and 4 goals) to his name.

So, we have a striker taking lots of shots, scoring none, not creating chances for others, with one of the poorest passing completion rates in the team, who isn't really the hardest worker defensively.  What does more does he realistically offer that others don't?  Whether to play Borini or Balotelli is, at best, debatable based upon actual on field production, regardless of the fact that Balotelli is the more talented player, at least for me, and the above is why.  

Frankly I'd play Sterling over either and as for the oft-talked about partnership between Balotelli and Sturridge, I see very little point in taking someone like Lallana or Sterling off the pitch in favor of Balotelli.  If (and it's gigantic, massive, big if), Mario were to knuckle down, work hard in training, actually listen to his teammates and coaches, then I suspect he could in fact be 'world class', but sadly he doesn't seem to have the inclination to do this at all.  Better managers than Rodgers have tried and failed and I don't see this effort being any different although I hope to be completely proven wrong as I genuinely do like him as a person, just not as a player on the team I support.

Now i'm not saying Ivanovic is not at fault at all and makes no mistakes, but you have to consider that there is no dedicated right winger back tracking for him and he is essentially playing wing back, so there is a lot being asked of him. Another thing is if Mourinho honestly thought that Ivanovic was a liability he would have benched him a while ago which might be because Mourinho expects him to play in advanced positions but we cant know that for sure.

Oh my... you think that that financial services gave much in the form of tax revenue... it doesn't. Infact it gives fuck all compared to tax revenue by smaller businesses (have a look at the government data, it's free online where most of their tax comes from).

Listen I've studied business and economics for the past several years and I'm damn bloody good at it. I don't agree with a cap on bonuses, but I do agree with banks getting slapped down considering it's my money and yours that went into saving them... there isn't even a school of economic thought where banks being to big to fail is good. Tax revenue decreases because we lifted a few million out of the need to pay it.

Your talking as if public spending is a bad thing... if you are one of the richest nations in the entire world why on earth wouldn't you have a large amount of public spending. I personally will be happy to pay tax to help the welfare state once Uni ends, atleast then I know my tax will be doing some good.

The saddest thing is that anyone (right or left) seem to have opinions on the economy and welfare spending when they know fuck all about either. Allow me to show you;

Scoial services spending should be higher, but lets not fuck around and be honest most people on welfare (which is something we should be proud of) are there because they have lost a job. I have no idea where you've gotten the economy will tank by giving more to the worst off because the entire point of QE is the opposite (buy up easy assets so banks/investors ill take more risks with credit) and it's been proven that giving the poorest more money boosts the economy... because they spend more. (just google search it, I cba giving you a lecture on why)

I'm gunna be honest here, sorry if I came across as a dick but so much of what you've just typed is so wrong, economically and socially. To me atleast you seem like someone who has read a few newspapers on the economy and think you know what's going on.

It's come full circle now though, since feeling the need to ""avenge"" him sounds like idolisation to me.

It should also be noted that the hadith literature is what forbids depictions, which was essentially hearsay of what Muhammad had said but not put in the Quran, collected long after he had died. Different branches of Islam follow different sets of hadith, like the fact that Shiites generally are not as strict with depictions as Sunnis.

It should also be said that hadith literature was the basis for sharia law, and as far as I know the only thing a Muslim is required to follow is the Quran. Since Islam is decentralised there is no body to interpret the Quran and hadith to provide guidance, so there are a lot conflicting beliefs, like the whole depiction debate.",null,0,null,1421293380,null,0,false,0,cnpfxif,null,t3_2sfvax,null,t1_cnpfxif,null,t1_cnpdkhn,null,null,null,1424868952,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

1. Interest isn't being shown because of his Socceroos form. If that's the only familiarity you have with him then you don't know what kind of keeper he has become.
2. The form he'd be looked at for is his performances with Club Brugge. Who are currently on top. For the last 18 months he's been considered the best keeper in Belgium. This has been acknowledged with his keeper of the year award. With his pros being an amazing shot stopping ability and a really strong ability to play with his feet (which is something Rodgers wants). He performs consistently. Talk to any Brugge supporter and they'll all gush.
3. He's keeping Mitch Langerak, who recently had a stint for Dortmund as their number one our of the Socceroos starting lineup. This is no mean feat. Mitch Langerak was lauded by Dortmund fans and is a fantastic keeper.

I think he's still got room to improve. But I think it's definitely worth signing him. I believe he's better than what we have at the moment. Maybe Mignolet is as good at shot-stopping but Ryan is 20x better with the ball at his feet.

1) One need not engage in a behavior or support it to defend its right to exist.  To suggest otherwise, as Hasan does, is vapid.

2) The Holocaust has not only been the subject of comedy, there is a cottage industry that exists just to deny whether it happened at all.  Look up David Irving, or watch ""Dr. Death"".  To date, not one person who denies that the Holocaust happened has been murdered for making that claim, or publishing anything in support of that idea.

Further:

3) Jesus Christ is openly mocked so often it hardly bears mention.  In fact, Monty Python's masterpiece ""Life of Brian"" mocks just about everything surrounding that mythos.  There was certainly outcry and controversy surrounding that film, but to date not one person involved with that film was killed because of it.

4) [Jesus is a jerk is a thing.](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/jesus-is-a-jerk/photos)  Nobody associated with those, or owners of websites linking to them have been murdered because of them.

5) [A photo called *Piss Christ* won awards and the artist got National Endowment for the Arts funding.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piss_Christ)

It bears mention that Hasan and others miss the False Dichotomy they  assert regarding the Holocaust.  The Holocaust was an event that happened *to* the Jewish population of Europe.  Islam is a belief system.  It would be equivalent to say that Islam doctrine/beliefs can be mocked, but Judaism cannot.  Or Christianity for that matter.  This is obviously not so.

Charlie Hebdo had multiple covers mocking all forms of Christianity and belief. [Here's one.](http://i.embed.ly/1/display/resize?key=1e6a1a1efdb011df84894040444cdc60&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FB6wNt1dIcAIZehK.jpg)  No murders from that cover.

Dah-ta

I always think its funny when English people pick up on that and try to correct me when the range of pronunciations in the UK is way more than Australia! 

E.g mum, muddy, bus, bath - vary by the same amount as day-ta and dah-ta.

I'm really loving British placenames as it's such a hit and miss affair if you can pronounce the name of some small villages.

BTW. There are three different ways to say ""data"". The American way is slightly different to the Australian way.

&gt;No, we all have a responsibility to work together to make our society safe. Do you advocate we all turn off our burglar alarms and leave our doors open because it is not 'incumbent' on us to be sensible? Of course people who choose to lock their doors and set alarms are still free not to do so.

False dichotomy.  Being prudent regarding burglary is not the same as limiting ideas for fear of violent reprisal.

Beyond the fact that you miss the point entirely.

People should be free to express themselves without fear of violence.  This is so basic I find it alarming that I have to type it.  This has been a basic rule of civil society for literally centuries.  This principle should not have to adapt because a subset of people don't get it.

&gt;If you were a teacher in a school would you stop children calling another child names? Or would you say it was incumbent on the bullied child to realise it is 'a natural result of freedom of expression'?

Another false dichotomy.  Mocking ideas is not equivalent to mocking individuals.  In point of fact, there are laws in place that protect individuals from libel and slander.  There are no laws protecting ideas of any sort, because ideas have no rights.  Again, this is staggeringly basic.

In terms of generic money advice, I always recommend the following 5 rules;

1. Track your spending (spreadsheet/YNAB)
2. Spend less than you earn
3. Save up an emergency fund (approx 3 months expenses to start with)
4. Pay off existing debt, and avoid future debt like the plague it is (with the possible exception of a mortgage)
5. Save for the long term (usually means investing. I'd normally recommend index trackers but for someone about to go into med school I would suggest investing in yourself. Work hard, master your studies, and focus on graduating from med school with flying colours.)


Some of the other points will be slightly different for you. I'm guessing bank of mum and dad might be able to help you out financially if you get yourself into trouble, especially early on. But please avoid debt, especially credit card debt. It is poison.


Medical school can be a lot of fun, but much of that fun involves alcohol in some way. Try to moderate your intake, it'll help both your health and your wealth. 


As for learning about the absolute basics of finance, you may find the following links helpful;


- Check out the FAQ in both the UK pf subreddit, and the main pf one. Lots of great info.


- [bogleheads.org](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started)
this is an american site, focused on index investing, but their getting started page has lots of great advice about budgeting and personal finance

- [Mr Money Mustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com) Great US site. MMM saved much of his income and managed to retire early, in his 30s. His writings changed the way I look at my personal finances


- [Joshua Kennon](http://www.joshuakennon.com) Another great US site. Josh is an excellent writer, and a savvy businessman to boot. Pretty much everything on his site is solid gold advice, but check out the personal finance section.

I learned about it in High School when we studied Jean Le Carre's ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"". There's a reference there to someone being threatened to be ousted because of something ""queer"". e.g. gay or cross dresser.

Blackmail goes both ways. Your gay agent could be blackmailed (pre-1990s), and your agent could blackmail another gay agent to become a double agent!

Someone else already said this, but the Triodos funds appear to have significant initial and ongoing fees. Also, you mentioned the Pioneer fund has a 19% three year annualised return, which truly is fantastic, but it was beaten by its reference index's 20.2% three year annualised return. [See the performance tab here](https://www.triodos.co.uk/en/personal/ethical-investments/socially-responsible-investments/sustainable-pioneer-fund/about-the-fund/)


When you look at a slightly longer term, 5 years, the fund's return falls to 7.9%, which is much more in line with what you should expect from stocks over the long term. And ironically, its still beaten by its reference index's 10.5% a year annualised return.


However, although the fund may make 7-8% a year over the long term (or may not!), you certainly will not make as much money. You'll be 3% down from the moment your money enters the fund, and from then on you'll be paying the astonishingly high 1.96% a year management charge, which they helpfully note includes a 1.70% a year management fee! At this rate, you'll be lucky to make 5% a year on your investment.


It is laudable that you want to focus on socially responsible investing, but the investment vehicles you've chosen will just end up fleecing you. I would suggest, (as I always do) going with a low cost index tracker from Vanguard. If you want socially responsible investments, Vanguard have SRI funds (socially responsible investments), whose summary you can see [here](https://www.vanguard.co.uk/documents/portal/literature/vanguard-socially-responsible-investing-funds-retail.pdf)


Their [Vanguard SRI Global Stock fund](http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/funds/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=F00000N9WG) has a still excellent annualised return of 13.89% over 3 years, but they have no entry fee, and their ongoing charge is a measly  0.35%. The [Vanguard SRI European Stock fund](http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/funds/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=F00000N9WE) has a 3 year annualised return of 11.42%, and a charge of 0.3% annually. 


Unless you have over £100,000 to invest as a lump sum, you will need to buy Vanguard funds through a fund platform in the UK, but the costs will still be far cheaper than the Triodos funds. The evidence strongly suggests that over long periods of time, cost is what matters in investing. Cheaper funds will do better for you.

With fossil fuels in decline, and increasingly desperate attempts to squeeze the last dregs of them out of the ground (fracking...), Nuclear seems the only sensible medium-term option until we can find something better.

As for financial institutions targeting medics, I never really experienced targeting per se. I do know that I found it very easy to get bigger and bigger increases on my overdraft, and credit card applications just seemed to sail through, with cards of £1000+ limits just landing on my doorstep. This, coupled with a complete lack of understanding of personal finance, and very little in the way of self restraint, left me with a great deal of debt by the time I entered my 30s. It took a good deal of studying (personal finance), and lifestyle changes, before I managed to get myself back on track.

Financial services was the last thing the UK was good at. 

Cost of the bailout was much less than you think. Less than running the NHS for a year. 

How much do you earn? I'd be quite surprised if any of your tax money went towards the bailout. You need to be earning more than £35k to be putting in more than you take from the system. I.e. A net contributor. 

Just to clarify some of your other points which are completely incorrect:

&gt;I have no idea where you've gotten the economy will tank by giving more to the worst off

Strawman and not what I said. I said that by making the deficit larger it will tank. Which is true. We have the biggest budget deficit in the world.

&gt;the entire point of QE is the opposite (buy up easy assets so banks/investors ill take more risks with credit)

You haven't even gotten the definition of QE correct. It has nothing to do with 'easy' assets. Do you honestly think that? It's the central bank buying it's own debt to increase money supply and lower lending rates. It's more broadly an attempt spur investment rather than saving in the economy.

&gt;Listen I've studied business and economics for the past several years and I'm damn bloody good at it. 

No you're not. You're a student who's read a few text books, read some comment is free and think you know the answer to everything.

&gt;I'm gunna be honest here, sorry if I came across as a dick but so much of what you've just typed is so wrong, economically and socially. To me atleast you seem like someone who has read a few newspapers on the economy and think you know what's going on.

10 years at Goldman and a nice cushy job in a hedge fund as a result of it would suggest otherwise.

null,false,muffinmonk,lfc99,,null,"Not exactly true. The past 4 years, they have really stopped phoning it in. No longer is the old FIFA that literally did nothing for years. I'll explain.

12: Tactical Defending, and the tightest graphics of the last gen. This was massive in the aspect of game enjoyability. No longer could you be schooled by someone who knew how to time the dribbles, you can now play at his level and anticipate every single move.

13: New Physics engine, FIRST TOUCH. This was a huge gambit. No longer to players take the ball in their stride. Depending on their stats, they play far more realistically and familiar. Messi and Ronaldo have perfect touches and runs, Gervinho and Spearing are total shit at receiving the ball. This changes the game immensely during shooting and the midfield battle. Through balls become more reliant to your play. Skill games are introduced, which is great for practicing your weaknesses.

14: An obvious one, but aside from 13, it's the graphics engine. Now, there are thousands of 3D spectators. No more cutouts. All-new face scans. the grass is actually grass, you can see the footprints being left behind. The players are more intelligent, meaning you no longer have to one-two pass in order to get someone moving, they do it themselves. You can be like gerrard and spot a run 40m away and do the hollywood ball for a chance if it opened up that way. They also revamped ball physics. You can now create amazing goals that aren't just rockets of lofted. They have direction depending on how and when it was hit. FUT's been revamped as well.

15: Even better graphics. Recorded chants mean the crowd is loud when you score, or silent when you're losing. It's so refreshing to hear YNWA when you score in the 85th minute and the people think you've got it in the bag. The stadiums look amazing, because they have been remodeled to look picture perfect, especially the Premier League, which is what they're focusing on at the moment. Players are emotional, and depending on the way the match goes, they can either switch off or get fired up. The GKs are also greatly improved. No longer can you just exploit the game, they have 15 new animations that allow them to chase that ball without aligning themselves so awkwardly. This makes them great shot stoppers, and means you have to pick your shots. Reffing and defending have been refined. You can now tussle with a player who isn't on the ball, even puling their shirt.

It's not an analogy at all, it's literally the way you've decided to characterise his donation - as if he'd committed a crime and this was his punishment. For some reason it appears to have entirely passed you by that he could have decided to give fuck all and that would've been the end of it.

That is not a fact. I've heard no facts from you. In fact, I've asked you two questions and the first you've straight up lied and you've showed an ongoing refusal to even answer the second. I don't see why it's so hard - if £500 isn't the correct amount of money for the guy to donate, what is?

Lol, why do you think I should care about any of that given that the only part of the defamation issue that is relevant here - that YOU'VE decided is relevant here - is the money the ""victim"" is supposedly entitled to? What punishment do courts give in these cases aside from damages that I should've mentioned because it's so relevant here? Corporal punishment? Placing in the stocks? 

Why have you decided that I need to know all the reasons courts give when they're deciding what damages to award when its blindingly obvious that the only reason I brought that up was as a casual example illustrating the broad sequence of events defamation cases take - supposing just for a minute that it's not just a transparently pathetic attempt to focus on something minor and irrelevant to everything, just so you can avoid dealing with the giant hole you've dug yourself.",null,0,null,1421310038,null,0,false,0,cnpm6q3,null,t3_2sbg82,null,t1_cnpm6q3,null,t1_cnp650m,null,null,null,1424865964,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Yes, some of Savile's victims were indeed fobbed off by police, but other reports, over a period of decades, were investigated.

I think 3 or 4 investigations were opened against Savile during his lifetime, but unfortunately there was no computerised national database of crimes back in the 60s and 70s, so the latter cops who interviewed him were unaware of the previous allegations.

It turns out that Savile was extremely prolific, and I think there have even been allegations he messed with dead bodies at Stoke Mandeville, but the nature of the crimes he was accused of during his lifetime were not extraordinary, not in terms of sexual predation or how we understand it today.

I don't recollect the details, but the accusations Savile got away with - i.e. they were made during his lifetime but they were unsubstantiated, either because the plod fucked up or otherwise - were pretty run of the mill. I don't say that to belittle them, or dismiss what happened to his victims, but they were the kind of sexual assaults that we can all comprehend.

Watkins' crimes were unbelievably depraved, and if someone came to you with allegations of literal baby rape, I wouldn't blame you for being dubious.

I don't know if the cops have the right to seize and search your computer on the basis of a single allegation, but if they do then I hope they would hold your ex to a high standard of credibility before they pushed their way into your home and put you in handcuffs.

Time has proved Mjadzelics correct, and this prosecution of her was clearly malicious, but that doesn't change the fact that police shouldn't act on every crazy allegation made by a spurned ex - sometimes there simply isn't enough substance for a warrant.

I suspect that Mjadzelics' frustration with the cops made her appear crazier and crazier each time she reported Watkins, undermining her own credibility. It would be quite understandable for her to have ranted ""why don't you stop him? I've told you before he's raping little babies"", but perhaps you can see, too, how crazy that sounds. 

The cops can't stop every crime, it's just more distressing when they fail to stop crimes of a sexual nature. In hindsight everything seems clear, but it's simply not that way at the time.

I am from Kansas and received a scholarship to attend the University of Edinburgh Art School for a semester. I just recently started my first painting and the subject is the Queen as a reptilian. I thought I would do a series on the conspiracies of the Royal Family. Last night I was talking to my boyfriend about my plan over Skype and he said I better look up the law. I tried but I could not find anything specific.  What do the laws in the UK  say about painting the Queen in such a way? Could I go to jail or get expelled?  

There is no "" Queen of England"". She is HRH Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas Queen, Defender of the Faith. This is especially poignant since calling her the Queen of England in SCOTLAND will likely lose you respect from your peers. There is even contention that she's even the second up there since they didn't have a first Elizabeth (they were separate kingdoms during the reign of Elizabeth I). 

As for changing her image? I believe that it's illegal to deface her image on money or stamps, but only if you intend to use them. Otherwise, it's okay to change her image. Just look at other examples like God Save the Queen by the Sex Pistols. People complained, but it wasn't a crime. Feel free to do most things in an expression of art.

null,false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,null,"BT doesn't care what hardware you use - both as an ISP (home hub) and as the network operator (VDSL modem). They won't turn your connection off or send a nastygram. The only ISPs that care are Sky (who make it incredibly difficult to use your own equipment) and Virgin (who won't let you use a standalone modem, you have to keep their superhub connected if only in modem mode)

If you have the Openreach white VDSL modem, you can eliminate some hassle by buying a router that claims it will work on cable (ie has an ethernet WAN port) and using that with the modem. As long as the router also supports PPPoE it will do.

If you want to get rid of both, then there are a few routers with integrated VDSL. The TP-Link one seems to be an okay mix of price vs performance.

I think you're reading too much into the router log. I don't know what the BT router logs but it looks like it's logging what it thinks is an ""attack"" than anything to do with this.

They aren't just places to drink but act more like a social hub, so families will go there for a lunch or dinner, groups of friends with their kids will meet and the kids will play in the garden while the adults get merry. Or if your family has come to visit you'll go to the pub for some food and a catch up. Older couples there for a drink and to read the paper on a Sunday. But then in the evening groups of friends will meet and get sloshed. In towns we have proper bars where people go to meet each other and dance etc. But most will meet in their local pub for a couple before heading in. Then if the landlord is so inclined you'll get a dedicated group of regulars who get to stay past last orders. If you're lucky and make friends with the landlord you can end up back at your local for a lock in after being out, which is a great way to end the night.

And a lock in is one of those offences which is sort of tolerated and ignored by the authorities.

&gt; Net migration rate is the difference of immigrants and emigrants of an area in a period of time, divided (usually) per 1,000 inhabitants (considered on midterm population). A positive value represents more people entering the country than leaving it, while a negative value means more people leaving than entering it.  

[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_migration_rate)  
  
  
&gt; Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 260,000 in the year ending June 2014, a statistically significant increase from 182,000 in the previous 12 months.  

[source](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/november-2014/stb-msqr-nov-2014.html)  
  
  
&gt; During the 1960s and 1970s, there were more people emigrating from the UK than arriving to live in the UK. During the 1980s and early 1990s, net migration remained at a relatively low level.  Since 1994, it has been positive every year and rose sharply after 1997. During the 2000s, net migration increased, in part as a result of immigration of citizens from the countries that joined the EU in 2004. Since the mid-2000s, annual net migration has fluctuated between around 150,000 and 300,000.

As far as population density goes, the country could sustain a great many more people before it becomes unable to sustain that population. South-East England, for example, is currently a lowly 13th out of the top 17 most densely population regions on the planet, and there's plenty of empty space in the UK that could be re-purposed to support additional people.

&gt;__65daysofstatic__ (often abbreviated as __65dos__, __65days__, or simply __65__) are an [instrumental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental) [electronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music) [post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-rock)/[math rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_rock) band. Formed in [Sheffield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield), [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), in 2001, the band is composed of Paul Wolinski, Joe Shrewsbury, Rob Jones and Simon Wright.

&gt;The band’s music has been described as heavy, progressive, guitar-driven instrumental [post rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-rock), interspersed with live drums and [off-beat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(music\)) [sampled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music\)) drums akin to those of [Aphex Twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphex_Twin), although they have continued to evolve their sound by incorporating [electronic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music), [drum and bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_and_bass) and [glitch music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_(music\)). They have been described as, ""a soundtrack to a new dimension, where [rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music), [dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music) and [electronica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music) are equals."" 

&gt;Their debut album, *[The Fall of Math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_Math)*, was released in September 2004, to critical acclaim, described as ""an album that can retain the dynamics, fraught tension and climactic explosiveness of its peers and influences, whilst still sounding like one of the most urgent and direct long-player releases of the year.""  The band went on to release a further four studio albums, *[One Time for All Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Time_for_All_Time)*, *[The Destruction of Small Ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Destruction_of_Small_Ideas)*, *[We Were Exploding Anyway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Were_Exploding_Anyway)*, [*Wild Light*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Light_(album\)) and a soundtrack, *[Silent Running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Running_(album\))*, respectively.

The SNP are likely to hold the balance of power this time, given that the Lib Dem vote has all but collapsed, and they have ruled out a coalition with the Tories. This leaves them, assuming that they want more powers for Scotland, with the option to either support Labour formally to get what they want (i.e. coalition) or informally to get what they want (i.e. confidence and supply).

Given the disdain for the current coalition, I think that the latter is more likely.

As for UKIP, they'll probably get a few seat, definitely fewer than 10, and will have little to no influence in the next parliament (thank god).

Also, those 5 goals we conceded when Jones was in goal, who was in the defensive midfielder? Gerrard. In the United game he wasn't even supported by Lucas. In the Arsenal game he was but that game was much different from the United one. I'd say that we've taken a big step forward when keeping Gerrard away from DMF position. I think he even played there in the Burnley game? We conceded so many chances there. After that he played there in the Leicester game. We were a bit shaky during that game. Is it just coincidence or we're much more solid at the back when not playing Gerrard as a DMF? 

&gt; And yet however many chances we've conceded the goals has been the same. Why we are still conceding the same amount from fewer chances needs looking at.

HSBC has 0.4% account fee. I do not know if that is normal or high or what? I was not able to find size or existence of such fees for ISAs on other banks (than again for most of them I was not able to find any fee structure).

&gt; 
&gt; A mortgage supported by the Help to Buy: mortgage guarantee scheme works in exactly the same way as any other mortgage except that under the scheme the Government offers lenders the option to purchase a guarantee on mortgage loans.
&gt; 
&gt; Because of this support, lenders taking part are able to offer home buyers more high-loan-to-value mortgages (80-95%).
&gt; 
&gt; You will still be fully responsible for your mortgage repayments. So if you have a 5% deposit, you will need to take out and pay back a 95% mortgage.
&gt; 
&gt; Example: for a home with a £200,000 price tag

1. I support Labour because I think it's a party that genuinely desires socioeconomic change but respects democracy: It recognises that it operates in a society with diverse views and needs and knows that its 'comfort-zone' policies are not always the ones that most people agree with. People sometimes describe this attitude as 'selling-out our principles' but I think it's just democracy: We do what we can to give people what they want *and* what we think they need. They don't always agree because - again - that's democracy.

1. This is a difficult one because there are several possible answers. I think a good one is to point out that free-market economics absolutely requires a large-ish number of unemployed people. It never reaches full employment. Economists accept this is the case and consider it a price worth paying for the benefits of free market capitalism, while pointing out that unemployment (despite what the *Mail* might claim) is rarely permanent. Given all this it seems particularly cruel and inhuman not to provide a safety net for the victims of a problem that is *demanded* by our socioeconomic system.

1. See under point one, regarding the need for a left-wing party that responds to the whole of society. The Greens have a lot of very respectable, very left-wing views but if Labour adopted them they'd cede the governance of the country to the right wing forever. Labour's eighteen years being very left wing in Opposition happened within my lifetime (and yours, I assume), so this isn't just speculation on my part. Additionally, the Greens have a lot of very *non*-respectable left-wing policies (businesses cannot afford a £10-an-hour minimum wage!). They also embrace anti-scientific views over homeopathy and GM foods (their candidate for London Mayor, Jenny Jones, attended a 'protest' that was in fact an attempt to sabotage and destroy an experiment into GM foods).

I found the 600s a lot easier to ride. Very smooth indeed, they don't get thrown around by the road as much and have the low down power to behave smoothly and predictably at low speed.

The only thing to be wary of is the power. The controls elicit a much more immediate response, especially the throttle.

I was concerned that the huge bump in power would take me off guard; that I would forget and pull the throttle wide open when taking off as I was used to on a 125. 

Didn't end up being a concern, I never ""forgot"" I was on a powerful bike and I never ended up wedged in a hedge.

So I think the best input I can offer is, relax and enjoy it. Tremendous fun.

The E&amp;W legislation is lightyears behind the legislation in Scotland, it would be a massively retrograde step and you'd make yourself hugely unpopular in certain sectors in Northern Ireland. 

What would you do with Scottish (non-faith) belief marriages? Take them across the UK or bin them in Scotland? 

What would you do with licensing? Use Scotland's model? Or England's model?

null,false,a01chtra,flair5,,null,"My thoughts, having also been at the match:

**Vorm** – 6/10.
Improved as the game went on but positionally not great. Not much he could do about either goal.

**Davies** – 5/10.
Competent defensively but struggled in what turned out to be a very demanding role producing nothing going forward. He and Rose did not work well together, with Rose often too deep and too predictable, and Davies refusing to overlap.

**Kaboul** – 5/10
Started extremely poorly, probably at fault for the first goal (albeit it is a ridiculous pass). Spent much of the game being shouted at by Vertonghen, had an argument briefly with Vorm after trying to shield the keeper from a Burnley player running through after Vorm had called it his own. Dominant in the air and ran forward well with the ball especially at times when we were looking short of ideas, and was covered well by Capoue/Stambouli. Could have scored twice and also played three unbelievably good passes. Made a challenge in the area that I still don’t know if it was a penalty or not but looked good and saved a goal. It is a 5 based essentially off an average of 1, 10, 1, 10. It looked to me that he has lost the faith of his colleagues and his time is consequently up.

**Vertonghen** – 7/10
Shares responsibility for the first goal due to poor communication, and we looked vulnerable to the long balls that Burnley were stuck on for a solid 20 minutes. Did start to work better with Kaboul as the game went on and made some fantastic challenges. Almost back to his best.

**Chiriches** – 6/10
Mostly poor defensively and positionally poor also. Benefited from a stellar showing from his colleague on the right, but contributed well to this with some good attacking movement. Unlucky not to score just before he did score.

**Rose** – 6/10
Scored and was solid but shut us down as an offensive force on the left wing until Chadli came on. The ball would go out to the left, then back to the right where something would actually happen. Repeat. Disappointing performance, needed to be more attacking in this advanced role and make runs into the space behind the opposing fullback but was too often waiting for a short pass in a congested left side of the middle of the pitch.

**Townsend** – 9
Didn’t get the goal he deserved, but single handedly won the game. Absolutely unplayable as an offensive force down the right, constantly beating his man regardless of double marking and created countless excellent opportunities for both Paulinho and Bobby, which they converted at a disappointingly bad rate. Bore happily the responsibility for the team’s attack and thrived. Outstanding performance showing great skill and tricks, pace and intelligence in the final third. Fabulous performance.

**Stambouli** – 5/10
Acquitted himself adequately. Limited by his role which required him to drop into the back three leaving a chasm in the centre of the park and blunted us as an attacking force. Limited Burnley to long balls over the top and can feel pleased with his day’s work.

**Capoue** – 7/10
Thunderous goal to cap a better execution of the role Stambouli was playing too. Largely the same criticisms apply.

**Paulinho** – 8/10
Poor finishing allied to excellent movement and effort – often available and always making the run. Left a bit of a gap in central midfield but I felt this was the responsibility of those behind him. Argument could be made that he should have dropped deeper to help them but exploited space well. Neat footwork on several occasions in tight situations. Not quite his performance against Stoke, but thrived.

**Soldado** – 6/10
I really want this to be a higher number, but I just can’t. His finishing was poor, and he didn’t make the runs the team needed. He did make runs the team didn’t need, waiting for throughballs thirty to forty yards out, which were appropriately ignored. Passed well and was neat in possession, two good assists but both in truth owing a massive debt to the Modric assists from an inspired Townsend. Solid performance but can’t miss those chances and still be an elite striker. I can’t bring myself to barrack the poor bastard, but it was again an exercise in generating pathos rather than goals.

Subs:

**Chadli** – 6/10
Not really on long enough to make a proper impression on the game but did fine and enabled the left wing outlet. One great run which should have resulted in a goal.

**Onomah** – 7/10
It’s his debut at 17, and that is the context for a higher rating than Chadli. Looked exceptionally neat in possession after a nervous first couple of touches, played quick one touch passes and looks a real prospect. Might need a shade longer before first team action but I an hugely excited by that showing at that age. Has real potential to be a classy player in the creative number 10 role, but looks like he could play well deeper or indeed wider. Sounded like the 1882 were chanting ""Joshonomah Doo doo do-doo doo"" to the tune of Phenomenon by the Muppets, which would be excellent.

**Match** – 9/10
Exhilarating game, classic FA Cup tie. Dazzling goals, a really wonderful performance from Townsend, a 4 goal swing and a half time reminisce from Gary Mabbutt talking about his FA Cup win (and loss against Coventry). Clean performances from both sides and good refereeing. Advert for the sport. Crowd were a bit shellshocked to begin with but in good voice otherwise. I’ve lost my voice.

Going to the Sunderland game too with family – Sunderland family so will be mousey quiet in the wrong end.

I opted to convert all the open funds into cash; I could have re-registered everything with iWeb (nothing is sold, just ownership changed), but HL likes to charge an absurd £25+VAT per fund. Transferring the cash means you miss out on market fluctuations during the period of transfer, but I doubt I'd have gained £25+VAT across eight funds (£240) -- plus I wanted to change them anyway.

&gt; Is it actually possible to move uninvested funds (I currently only hold uninvested cash in my HSBC stocks and shares)

[The iWeb transfer form gives you a few options on what you want to transfer (cash only, cash and funds)](http://www.iweb-sharedealing.co.uk/PDFs/IWeb_ISAManagerTransferForm.pdf). 

&gt; Also how is funds selection on iWeb (I might have started sucking at looking for stuff, because I could not find it on their website)? I was a bit disappointed with HSBC's selection of funds - so few trackers.

I made sure to [check fund availability](https://halifaxiweb.digitallook.com/funds) before I plumped for iWeb. It's certainly got a narrower range than some other providers, but for a casual investor it's got all of the popular funds/ETFs/shares. It's definitely not as easy to find what you're looking for as HL, but I'd rather have crappy menus and substantially lower fees over a slick-looking website.",null,0,null,1421321546,null,0,false,0,cnpoic1,null,t3_2sg4ip,null,t1_cnpoic1,null,t1_cnpobnd,null,null,null,1424864880,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

So I'll explain my point using these as examples.

North looks pretty safe at 44% to Tory... unless something local going on that not aware of (he is accused of something naughty or whatever).  in this case I have my doubts that someone is rationally debating between a safe seat Tory and a Green vote.  If one of the parties they want to win is almost certainly going to win then it's a no brainer to vote for other to encourage democracy.

In non-safe seats it makes sense to vote for major party you like (ie tactical voting).

So in both cases I can't understand why anyone would be deciding between Green and Tory (never mind the fact they are polar opposites on nearly every issue).

null,false,a01chtra,flair5,,null,"My thoughts, having also been at the match:

**Vorm** – 6/10.
Improved as the game went on but positionally not great. Not much he could do about either goal.

**Davies** – 5/10.
Competent defensively but struggled in what turned out to be a very demanding role producing nothing going forward. He and Rose did not work well together, with Rose often too deep and too predictable, and Davies refusing to overlap.

**Kaboul** – 5/10
Started extremely poorly, probably at fault for the first goal (albeit it is a ridiculous pass). Spent much of the game being shouted at by Vertonghen, had an argument briefly with Vorm after trying to shield the keeper from a Burnley player running through after Vorm had called it his own. Dominant in the air and ran forward well with the ball especially at times when we were looking short of ideas, and was covered well by Capoue/Stambouli. Could have scored twice and also played three unbelievably good passes. Made a challenge in the area that I still don’t know if it was a penalty or not but looked good and saved a goal. It is a 5 based essentially off an average of 1, 10, 1, 10. It looked to me that he has lost the faith of his colleagues and his time is consequently up.

**Vertonghen** – 7/10
Shares responsibility for the first goal due to poor communication, and we looked vulnerable to the long balls that Burnley were stuck on for a solid 20 minutes. Did start to work better with Kaboul as the game went on and made some fantastic challenges. Almost back to his best.

**Chiriches** – 6/10
Mostly poor defensively and positionally poor also. Benefited from a stellar showing from his colleague on the right, but contributed well to this with some good attacking movement. Unlucky not to score just before he did score.

**Rose** – 6/10
Scored and was solid but shut us down as an offensive force on the left wing until Chadli came on. The ball would go out to the left, then back to the right where something would actually happen. Repeat. Disappointing performance, needed to be more attacking in this advanced role and make runs into the space behind the opposing fullback but was too often waiting for a short pass in a congested left side of the middle of the pitch.

**Townsend** – 9
Didn’t get the goal he deserved, but single handedly won the game. Absolutely unplayable as an offensive force down the right, constantly beating his man regardless of double marking and created countless excellent opportunities for both Paulinho and Bobby, which they converted at a disappointingly bad rate. Bore happily the responsibility for the team’s attack and thrived. Outstanding performance showing great skill and tricks, pace and intelligence in the final third. Fabulous performance.

**Stambouli** – 5/10
Acquitted himself adequately. Limited by his role which required him to drop into the back three leaving a chasm in the centre of the park and blunted us as an attacking force. Limited Burnley to long balls over the top and can feel pleased with his day’s work.

**Capoue** – 7/10
Thunderous goal to cap a better execution of the role Stambouli was playing too. Largely the same criticisms apply.

**Paulinho** – 8/10
Poor finishing allied to excellent movement and effort – often available and always making the run. Left a bit of a gap in central midfield but I felt this was the responsibility of those behind him. Argument could be made that he should have dropped deeper to help them but exploited space well. Neat footwork on several occasions in tight situations. Not quite his performance against Stoke, but thrived.

**Soldado** – 6/10
I really want this to be a higher number, but I just can’t. His finishing was poor, and he didn’t make the runs the team needed. He did make runs the team didn’t need, waiting for throughballs thirty to forty yards out, which were appropriately ignored. Passed well and was neat in possession, two good assists but both in truth owing a massive debt to the Modric assists from an inspired Townsend. Solid performance but can’t miss those chances and still be an elite striker. I can’t bring myself to barrack the poor bastard, but it was again an exercise in generating pathos rather than goals.

Subs:

**Chadli** – 6/10
Not really on long enough to make a proper impression on the game but did fine and enabled the left wing outlet. One great run which should have resulted in a goal.

**Onomah** – 7/10
It’s his debut at 17, and that is the context for a higher rating than Chadli. Looked exceptionally neat in possession after a nervous first couple of touches, played quick one touch passes and looks a real prospect. Might need a shade longer before first team action but I an hugely excited by that showing at that age. Has real potential to be a classy player in the creative number 10 role, but looks like he could play well deeper or indeed wider. Sounded like the 1882 were chanting ""Joshonomah Doo doo do-doo doo"" to the tune of Phenomenon by the Muppets, which would be excellent.

**Match** – 9/10
Exhilarating game, classic FA Cup tie. Dazzling goals, a really wonderful performance from Townsend, a 4 goal swing and a half time reminisce from Gary Mabbutt talking about his FA Cup win (and loss against Coventry). Clean performances from both sides and good refereeing. Advert for the sport. Crowd were a bit shellshocked to begin with but in good voice otherwise. I’ve lost my voice.

Going to the Sunderland game too with family – Sunderland family so will be mousey quiet in the wrong end.

Germany already consistently managed to get over half its energy from renewables and that's already been done with fairly little government intervention. If you want to have a totally renewables-based infrastructure, you need to develop effective energy storage systems (like pumped storage or other new technologies like liquid-salt storage or pumped air storage) so that you can store energy from peak generation times for use in low generation times. That's not cheap, but it's definitely possible.

The other big problem with nuclear is that developing nuclear power is yet another distraction from the real goal of going completely renewable. If we set it our goal to become 100% renewable by 2030, I honestly believe that we could do it (and indeed, there have been reputable reports making the same assertion). However, if we start thinking of nuclear energy as a ""transition"" energy source, it's just going to end up being our new addiction. The fossil fuel lobby will be replaced by the nuclear lobby and whilst a totally nuclear-based society would be an improvement over the status quo, it's certainly nowhere near as good as a society where energy is owned locally by community owned cooperatives.

I went to see Liverpool v Chelsea at Anfield (The one where Suarez was banned for biting then scored the last second equaliser)

Unfortunately, as my friend is a Chelsea supporter, he could only get away tickets to Anfield. To be fair, they were class seats. Right behind the Goal, but just to the right, but also nearest the pitch. 

I went in my Liverpool top, but brought a hoodie to cover it up just in case (this was my first time sitting in the shit-fan section of Anfield and didn't know what to expect).

When we got there I was promptly told to either take it off, cover it up, or go home. As I was at the front though, everyone behind me could make out my red top from behind, so I got quite a lot of abuse. 

I didn't have to celebrate the goals, the steward just said to not celebrate Liverpool scoring.

Anyway, by the time it was 2-1 it felt like EVERYONE behind me had figured out I was a red. To be fair to the Chelsea fans, there was no malice in the abuse, and it was mostly light hearted.

That is until Suarez scored. Oh man. How quickly they turned.

In all seriousness though, it doesn't ruin the experience. There's nothing like sitting with your fellow supporters, cheering and singing, but if you have no other option financially then don't miss the game because of it.


Just, whatever you do, don't wear a liverpool top. I got lucky with the fans behind me, but if they got hostile I would have been the one ejected.

&gt;Feminist sociocultural models of rape posit that the patriarchal structure of society
perpetuates sexual violence against women. According to the social control model of
rape, the male-dominated structure of society is maintained by various societal factors
including sexual violence against women (e.g., Brownmiller, 1975; Griffin, 1979;
Sheffield, 1987). Sexual violence keeps women in a state of fear so that they are
dependent on others for their survival. Such theories have a relatively long history. One of
the first people to propose and begin to test a feminist sociocultural model was Martha
Burt (1980) who hypothesized that ""rape is the logical and psychological extension of a
dominant-submissive, competitive, sex-role stereotyped culture"" (p. 229). The purpose of
the present study is to examine the sociocultural model of sexual aggression (SA) by
synthesizing quantitatively the body of research that links masculine ideology to sexual
violence. It is hypothesized that to the extent that men agree with an extreme form of
masculinity that represents support for patriarchy ideology, they are more likely to be
sexually aggressive toward women.


&gt;In support of sociocultural models of rape, cross-cultural researchers have found that rape
rates vary along with aspects of the societal structure. In a study of 156 tribal societies,
Sanday (1981) found that there was cross-cultural variation in rape rates and that there
were reliable differences between ""rape-prone"" and ""rape-free"" societies. In rape-prone
societies the genders were more segregated, women were less powerful, and rates of
interpersonal violence were higher than in rape-free societies. Similarly, Reiss (1986)
found that in rape-prone societies there was more endorsement of a ""macho personality""
(e.g., accepting of physical aggression and high risk-taking, casual attitudes toward sex)
and more agreement with belief in the inferiority of females. Lottes (1984, cited in Lottes,
1988) found that in societies with high rape rates, women had lower status and violence
was more common.


&gt;The United States has been classified as a rape-prone society; it has the highest rape rate
of any industrialized country (Allison &amp; Wrightsman, 1993). Many studies have
documented high rates of sexual violence against women. In early rape research, the focus
was on rape that was reported in national crime statistics, and most people's idea was rape
by a stranger (see Muehlenhard &amp; Kimes, 1999). In the 1980s it became clear that there
were many unreported cases of rape and many undetected offenders. The research
reviewed in this paper deals with such undetected offenders who are likely to have
sexually aggressed against someone they know. The United States has a high rate of
""acquaintance rape"" according to a variety of anonymous, self-report surveys. For
example, Koss and Oros (1982) reported that 20-30% of a large sample of college
students had engaged in or been the victim of sexual aggression. Rapaport and Burkhart
(1984) found that about 28% of the college men they studied had engaged in sexualoercion. In a comprehensive study of a sample of students from 34 colleges and universites across the country it was found that about 12% of women students had been
victims of rape or attempted rape, and an additional 15% had experienced assault that met
the legal definition of rape (Koss, Gidcycz, &amp; Wisniewski, 1987). More recent studies
confirm these high rates (e.g., Calhoun, Bernat, Glum, &amp; Frame, 1997; DeKeseredy,
1997). Further, across a number of anonymous self-report studies, about one third of the
college men sampled indicated some likelihood that they would rape a woman if
guaranteed that they would not be caught or punished (e.g., Greendlinger &amp; Byrne, 1987;
Malamuth, Haber, &amp; Feshbach, 1980; Rapaport &amp; Burkhart, 1984; Smeaton &amp; Byrne,
1987).


&gt;Along with high rape rates, it is likely that attitudes about sexuality and violence in the
United States parallel those of other rape-prone cultures. Sheffield (1987) specifically
linked the sociocultural structure with individual attitudes and argued that traditional
gender-role attitudes are one of the social forces that maintain the existence of sexual
violence against women. Traditional gender roles encourage men to be violent in the
name of ""masculinity"" and women to be sexually passive in order to be ""feminine."" (In
addition, ""societal propaganda"" such as pornography and our use of language help to
construct and support attitudes and behaviors that are consistent with the patriarchal
structure.)",null,0,null,1421324808,null,0,false,0,cnpp913,null,t3_2sf5ql,null,t1_cnpp913,null,t1_cnpoz87,null,null,null,1424864534,null,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3,null

Really, it's not.  It's likely a mixture of oversupply from the US and falling demand in China due to their economy slowing down.  Lots of comoddities (copper, iron, steel) have been falling lately, all pointing to at least some demand destruction.  Nobody really seems to understand why it's crashing like it is, but it's not some dastardly backroom deal with the sheikhs.

&gt;  We do have gas reserves that we can frack in the short term

Not yet.  There's yet to be a profitably producing shale gas well in the UK, so until some wells are drilled we don't know what kind of flow rates we'll get and whether the resource is viable.  The only likely candidate is the Bowland, which might be enough to make a bit of a difference for maybe a decade or so, but that depends if you want the best part of a few thousand wells (at least) drilling in the north west.

Solar in the UK is a complete waste of solar panels, and we do have wind but are rapidly approaching the saturation point that the grid can deal with in terms of stability.  

Access to international energy markets is, frankly, the only realistic way we'd have of maintaining current energy use levels in the medium term without either absolutely massive expense or turning half the country into a mixture of wind farms and shale drilling pads.",null,0,null,1421325965,null,0,false,0,cnppjxz,null,t3_2sflwi,null,t1_cnppjxz,null,t1_cnp9l2n,null,null,null,1424864393,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

That is blatantly bullshit. If you want to access the picture you can do so, if you wish to purchase the paper, you can do so. It might the edgy opinion to post pictures of muhammad but it is actually deeply offensive to produce an image of him of ANY form. I grew up in South East Asia, so I happen to have known muslims personally. It's also worth mentioning that although it is (to the best of my knowledge) unique to Islam not to portray a picture of their prophet, some Jewish people write the word 'god' as 'g-d' for similar reasons. 

Also you shouldn't try to speak for every non-muslim out there, chances are some of them might have different opinions, you certainly don't speak for me. 

What happened in Paris was terrible and no one should face violence for freely expressing themselves, that is important for any democracy to function properly.

Basically, OP's looking at this product and is aware that it has denatured alcohol in it.  This is usually added to make a product dry faster on your skin, and it does that.  **But** it also dries out any surface you apply it on.  OP seems to not be bothered by the drying aspect, but denatured alcohol has been shown, in clinical tests, to basically rupture skin cells.  Her skin cells will not be so different as to avoid that worse effect, even if she isn't experiencing dryness though she does note tightness, I believe, Which is a sign of dryness and irritation.

Salicylic acid is also pretty drying by itself, it absorbs water readily but cuts through oils and inflammation very well.  Ideally, you should use a moisturiser of some sort when using a BHA.  Part of the reason people use an AHA at the same time is that those make your skin more receptive to moisture so it sort of negates the SA.  In the drying sense!

If you ask me, political correctness is the process through which ideas you wouldn't bring up in formal discussion are shunned.

It isn't some sort of formal plan, where people plan to be politically correct to push certain political ideas, it's the informal process where we filter what we say depending on the environment. 

However, if you ask a kipper about it (or many on the right for that matter), they would argue that political correctness is something specifically found in the left wing, and that it is a formal plan to curtail political discussion of right wing ideas. That's why you can find kippers unironically complaining about political correctness gone mad on the one hand, then ridiculing those who oppose them on the other. For them, opposing political correctness isn't opposing the shunning of less conventional political beliefs, it is opposing left wing opposition to right wing ideas.

It's just BoE buying it's own debt. Nothing to do with risk!

&gt;Are you an idiot? Everyone pays VAT so yes my money did go towards the bailout. I'm alright with that.

Unless you're earning more than £35k you have actually received money from the government. The money you've paid in VAT doesn't come close to paying anything in. You are a net receiver from the govt.

Point here being that you will no doubt disagree with me but we can and *are* having this debate meaning that Sky has a valid editorial position that should be have been respected by Fourest and wasn't. It's utterly insane to me that someone championing their right to choose what they do and do not publish would so clearly attempt to dictate what someone else does. 

EDIT:

Also just to be clear about something what Fourest did would have been unacceptable even if Sky had decided to publish the image, why? Because Sky would have done what place The Guardian have done, give warning to their views about show something that could potentially be offensive. Granted if they were going to show it she wasn't going to attempt to force them to do so but it highlights the point about editorial responsibility.

I liked Boyle's quote best of all: 'I'm reading a defence of free speech in a paper that tried to have me arrested and charged with obscenity for making a joke about the Queen'

The media themselves never get more worked up than when one of their own is killed. The hagiography seen when a journalists obituary is published is exponentially greater than with any other person. If Simon Heffer or Richard Littlejohn for example died tonight then tomorrow's Graun, Indy, Socialist Worker, would all say ""yeah, he was a bit right wing, but *oh what a fantastic journalist and writer, we will all miss him*"" because those fuckers are all paid up members of the writer's club.

So because a bunch of journos was attacked in Paris, *never mind that it was a political version of Viz* all of a sudden this is the new thing. Forget #kony2012, forget #bringbackourgirls, the media has made this what it is. And next year, next month, whenever, you will see business as usual from the papers, with the *Sun* and *Mail* writing ""BAN THIS SICK FILTH NOW"".

There is more outrage in the press when a journalist gets beheaded than an aid worker. But it's all to do with the company one keeps, isn't it? If an actor pops his clogs then all the other luvvies shed a tear while the rest of the world carries on. But they have a platform, don't they?

In any case, while the French did help the British - they helped the British Royal Navy practice against Mirages  - they also helped the Argentines including specifically with Exocets.

The Dassault (French aircraft manufacturer) and DGSE (French secret service) personnel stayed in Argentina during the conflict, and helped the Argentine's mount the Exocets onto their Super Etendards.  Without French help, it's extremely doubtful that the Argentines would have been able to do this themselves, and so would not have been able to fire any of the Exocets (except for the one they fired from land at HMS Glamorgan).

The Argentine pilots in the war were extremely brave, but their engineering support was poor:
- they couldn't fix or fit inflight refuelling equipment
- they couldn't fix ejector seats
- they had lost the manuals to their bombs, and couldn't adjust the fuses as a result (hence the famous fusing problem), nor could they jerry-rig a solution.   
- they couldn't upgrade Port Stanley runway, or bring steel matts.

(and all these things occurred despite French &amp; Israeli engineering help.

Much of the extra they get beyond a minimum wage is explicitly in the forms of disability benefits, designed to counteract the higher costs of living with a disability.

You can, of course, disagree with it in this specific case; but frankly if they got ATOS to agree they are disabled, then they must have some genuine problems.  (Which, again, I suspect the newspaper article is deliberately downplaying, for reasons of bias).

The transgender bathroom thing is a non issue. It basically amounts to hypothetical concerns that *heterosexual cisgender* men will pull a Mrs. Doubtfire to prey on women, which wouldn't actually be transgender people's problem if that's the case. 

The entire argument is based on the assumption heterosexual cis men are predatory and can't be trusted, so I'm not sure why so many of them use it to argue against transgender rights since the only people who's integrity they're undermining is their own. 

Has there ever been a report on the news of this happening? It's a transphobic scare story which is decades old and exists nowhere outside of television and bigoted imaginations. 

Trans people just wanna go the bathroom and leave like everyone else. A trans woman can't enter in a men's bathroom because she risks assault and harassment, and unless people make a habit of inspecting genitals then you wouldn't even know. Most people have probably shared a public bathroom with a trans person without even knowing.

I obviously can't comment on specific personal circumstances, and I think anyone pretending to be able to off the back of a newspaper article is deluding themselves.

&gt;he'll fail to explain how or why others, subjected to the exact same factors and environment, manage to avoid morbid obesity altogether.

I have explained it many times, or linked to articles, freely available, that do. Here's a recap anyway.

&gt;Being obese is not a discrete single large choice, but a series of thousands of smaller choices over your entire lifetime, influenced by factors both within your control (your strength of 'will', although I find that term horrendously wishy-washy) and factors outside of your control (environment, socioeconomic/education status, genotype, epigenotype, even the in utero environment while you were developing).  These factors are self-evidently variable between different individuals, different families, different ethnicities, etc.  I can provide examples if needed, but I'm sure you can brainstorm a few ideas.

&gt;The majority of the US and UK populations are now obese or overweight - that's not a reflection of choices per se (i.e, the populations basic willpower hasn't changed over time) but a reflection of the impact of the socioeconomic environment (and genome/environment interactions to a lesser extent) ON people's choices. 

&gt;Humans are extremely susceptible to obesity anyway through physiologies evolved through millennia of famine risk, and some are more susceptible than others, through genetic drift, interbreeding and competition between traits advantageous in differing environments.

Edit:

That's not to say some outliers aren't taking the piss, but they, as a small proportion of the obese population as a whole, aren't the ones we need to worry about.

&gt;They make it difficult to claim expenses, and make you wait. 

That is my experience of pretty much every expense claim generally so that's not really surprising.

&gt;Also, they won't pay for travel in peak times, and often procedures need to be carried out first thing in the morning.

Paying for travel full stop is pretty great regardless of time convenience.

&gt;Worth bearing in mind that this applies to cases where it isn't elective - say where a fetus dies and is rotting in utero, but a womans body is not expelling it. 

While horrible, this isn't the same thing as when the women's life is in danger (in which case the procedure would be done there and then). The risk to the mother is [smaller than you might think](http://www.meb.uni-bonn.de/dtc/primsurg/docbook/html/x5001.html). And in any case, the removal of a dead foetus isn't an abortion is it? Why would the woman have to go to London for this, if the 18 month legal requirement is no longer applicable? Could you point me to a few cases where this has specifically happened please?

&gt;Also, it's unreasonable if you're on benefits and can't afford to travel. 

True, but you do get the money back and there are options like overnight buses etc which are cheap.

&gt;Imagine finding out you are carring a baby with the most profound form of neural tube defect...Unless you've been in that position I think it's very easy to say that the whole Scottish clusterfuck of a system is ""reasonable"". I would suggest you try to imagine the kind of hell that experience is, but I hope that you, and nobody you care about ever has to experience it.

I understand that it is an emotive topic.

I think that the fact that you get everything free and even partners paid for is amazing, even if you have to wait for expenses to be returned and travel at inconvenient times.

Which other elective procedures does the NHS pay for you and your partner's travel and associated expenses? I'm curious.",null,0,null,1421331656,null,0,false,0,cnprhzr,null,t3_2sf5ql,null,t1_cnprhzr,null,t1_cnpoptz,null,null,null,1424863485,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt;I suggest you go and read some of the commentary on the attacks.

I read Hasan's article, and he's an idiot.  If you have another article you think pertinent link it and I'll read it.

&gt;This is a rather naive suggestion. It's not easy to draw a distinction between the two. My nature as an individual is made up of the ideas that I hold and how they are realised as behaviour and expression. 

All of those ideas you hold voluntarily, and aren't any more special than anybody else's.  All ideas are open to criticism.

Look at the American Family Association.  I hate them with the fire of 1,000 Suns.  Their beliefs derive from a very narrow view of Christianity, which I also despise.

Their right to exist trumps my feelings, and I do not think that any of their leadership, spokespeople or general membership should be murdered.

Behavior is very different than belief.  The recent attacks are a great example of this.  It is understandable that Muslims may be upset by cartoons of Muhammad (too bad, free society).  What is not is Muslims murdering people because their  feelings are hurt.  If the idea that it is ok to murder people who mock your ideas, your ideas are deeply flawed and antithetical to reason and civilized society.

&gt;Would you say, then, it's all right to mock a child for thinking God exists because it's just an idea?

There you go comparing Muslims to children again.  Why do you think that is a valid comparison?  Children have a limited understanding of the world, and believe all sorts of nutty things BECAUSE THEY ARE CHILDREN.  In fact, religious belief is often ridiculed as being the same as believing in the Tooth Fairy or Santa.  This is done because those two things are thought of as real BY CHILDREN.

Now, if you are asking me if it is ok to mock an adult who believes in the Tooth Fairy absolutely yes I do.

True tourist destinations I'd recommend:
The Scottish Whisky Experience
Edinburgh Castle- then a lovely jaunt down the historic royal mile/high street, but avoid the tacky Scottish tat shops. 
The palace of Holyrood and the Scottish Parliament and Arthurs seat.
Take a Rabbies tour to the highlands, and if you have time, head to the Isle of Skye, some of the most beautiful scenery in the world.
Take a cliche underground tour- try Auld reekie, but the dungeons are pretty naff unless your 13.
The Royal botanic gardens are a nice day out if you get the weather. 
Dean Village
Crammond beach.
For food- Somewhere special could be Fishers in the city down at the shore, or Cafe St Honore is amazing, but again expensive!
Mums great comfort food near Edinburgh Uni has amazing, you guessed it, comfort food. Think big pies with lots of mashed tatties.

null,false,Chlorophilia,null,null,null,"Hydro is even worse than nuclear in many cases, please do not think that I'm in favour of that! On top of the problems you've mentioned, hydro causes many political problems (because it pretty much wrecks the entire river system downstream, which is why a lot of countries are not particularly happy with China's damming regime) and social problems. Which technologies should be implemented obviously depends on what region you're talking about. I think Solar energy has a huge amount of potential, particularly with recent advancements allowing the production of PV panels from less environmentally harmful materials, and whilst they're most effective in equatorial regions they are still very effective in higher latitudes, as we've seen with Germany. It does take up land, that is correct, but if the solar panels are community owned rather than being owned by MNCs, local communities will be much more willing to support construction. A similar thing goes for wind turbines - a lot of people complain about NIMBYists who constantly block the construction of wind turbines but that's largely because they don't actually see any tangible benefit from it being built near them. If you start building co-op wind farms, social support rises. Wind and Solar are probably the most universally useful renewable technologies (Biomass has the potential to be widely used but there are quite a lot of problems, not least the fact that some bio-crops actually turn out to be more carbon intensive than natural gas) but there are plenty of other niche technologies that can be used contextually, such as Geothermal in tectonically active areas, and Tidal and Wave (I think both of these technologies are over-hyped but they still do have potential).

&gt;
&gt;Paul turns the lights on in the studio and tells Barry that they are late and tries to hurry up, meanwhile Paul says to the viewers that the studio is not quite ready yet and will soon get it shipshape. Barry arrives with a model of a ship just as the titles come on.
&gt;Paul hangs his coat up, but it keeps falling down. Paul hangs it up, but as soon as he turns round it falls down again. Paul does this many times, but gives up. He calls Barry and asks ""Have you got our holiday slides yet?"" Barry says that he is just getting them. Paul then says to Barry to get in the studio. Paul once again apologizes that the studio is not ready yet and to please bare with us. Paul tells Barry that the place in in a state. Barry mistakes Pauls jacket as rubbish and Paul says that its his best gabardine. Paul tells Barry that its their new premises. Paul then has a phone call from their landlord, Brent The Gent saying that he doesn't want any mess. It seems that he has installed some new air conditioning and wants to have a look at it. Barry has to go down the shop to get a dustpan and brush, so while Barry is away Paul has to think of something to fill in. Paul decides to show the MChuckle Brothers. However, the Mchuckles are asleep and don't realise that they are being filmed. They then see themselves on screen and start to dance. Paul wonders were Barry has got to, but finds him with a big dustbin cart and says to him that it'll have to do. Paul then shows the viewers the holiday slides and slides down one of them.
&gt;Barry starts to put rubbish in the cart, while Paul visits the drinks machine for an orange juice. He asks Barry for 10p. but as soon as he puts 10p in the machine and chooses the selection, nothing comes out except for the plastic cup. He then walks away, but as he walks away orange juice starts to come out from the machine. Paul tells Barry how clean the floor is and starts to write a script for the show. He throws the bin bags over the floor as they are in the way, but can't think of a script so he decides to get some inspiration by going for a walk. He then tells Barry to go to the tip with the rubbish. The show then goes into armchair theatre.

I'm proudest of Saul who i picked up from atl madrid in my first season as a backup to Lucas and has matured into quite the CDM/CM with nice passing.  I also snagged Alves from roma on a free thinking he would be a stop-gap for a year or two until Walke was rated higher, but he blew up to an 88 OVR after 2 seasons with me.

This is a very touchy area but could you imagine how much the club would earn from selling the naming rights of the entire stadium? Upwards of £15m a year would be a conservative guess for me, that's only something like £5m less than we get from our shirt spons

you bring up good points, officeplum. i think it would be a ""drop in the ocean"" but even at 10 pounds per ticket (and corporate boxes would obviously be raised more) for the current seating capacity would raise revenues close to 10m. but the point being, local fans want to keep the prices down and are holding the club ransom, but still want us to sign marquee players. i guess i just get frustrated when people, especially on this sub, sit there and say we should have bought hummels instead of lovren and balo, or reus instead of markovich or 2/3 world class players instead of 8 mediocre ones. in order to get from point a to b, we need to increasae revenues. i go through the same mental jarring when talking about us politics b/c in a similar way, youre damned if you don't raise taxes and keep spending, but your damned if you lower taxes and cut spending...so it's a lose lose and everyone will have an opinion on it. i just think if we as fans realistically expect to do things a the right way and b sustainably, we need to invest in our team's future. put the game on as many televisions as we possibly can, get our friends to do it. spend the extra money on tickets. support the club in any way we can, within reason of course, and then we can demand these things. we don't have oil rich, arab owners, and i don't want that. i think fsg are approaching this intelligently (raising seating to 60000, or 15,000 seats will increase revenues by at least 20-25m if not something closer to 40-50), we are buying young at cheaper prices and going to be able to sell on higher, we have some very bright academy prospects who, in 5 years time, will be between the 22-24 range and will be able to contribute or be sold on for profit and we aren't paying ridiculous wages. 

anyways that went from cogent, coherent response to a rant really quick and i apologize. i know a lot of people will have a difference of opinion with me on this, but i cant help but to compare ticket prices to the prices that i pay in my own neck of the woods here in the states. im sure i'm also missing a lot of the point from our fellow fans in england who are regularly attending matches and am not suffering the penny pinch that's going on over there. so i will end this response with, i still think if we want to sign world class players, increased prices maybe something fans need to consider, but i understand not wanting to do that.

Granted, the only time I ever watched him at Atletico was the CL semis, so perhaps he is riding a reputation he earned last year. So please, if I am missing something help me understand. 

He dives in and gets beat with consistency, and a defender diving in at any level is embarrassing. How is it acceptable for someone who is, allegedly, one of the best to do this regularly? He did it twice against Newcastle last week. The other most blatant example I can think of is the goal Sporting scored against us. Luis dove in, got beat, and then fucking WALKED as he watched his player advance into the box. Yes I know the goal did not matter, but I fail to see how that is acceptable behaviour at any scoreline. 

 More often than not his passes down the line go right into the shins of the opposition player in front of him. When his crosses into the box are on point, yes they are very good. But far more often he overhits it and wastes the opportunity. 

Sure he is good with a ball at his feet, for a defender. And that goal against Derby was magnificent. But personally, I prefer my defenders to not be a liability defensively.

That was good of you to address my point, which you have obviously understood.  Thank you.

&gt; Its not being a hero

Given that the reason they aren't doing what you ask is because they fear for their safety (otherwise why would they care about showing anything), then it absolutely is about being a hero.

It's not quite as easy as you seem to think to just stand up to bullies (or terrorists as they're called once they get some weapons).  Who knows, perhaps they will gain courage to do so; but personally I think for a decision as potentially dangerous, and quite obviously not clear cut, I don't think it was unreasonable to err on the side of caution when presented with this in an unexpected manner.

The Guardian published a copy of the cartoon a few days ago -- but they did so in an article that they will have thought long and hard about.  Sky, should they do the same, should be entitled to spend as long as they want on the decision too -- and they certainly shouldn't be villified if they don't decide the way you want them to.

&gt; the news should be a beacon of truth and information

I agree; but they didn't tell lies.  And they didn't supress information.  Your complaint is that they didn't stand up to terrorists -- and that isn't necesarilly their job.

&gt; Also, while its a minor point, theres a difference between inaction and active avoidance.

I agree there is; but if you believe in freedom at all, you should believe that you are just as free to avoid as you are to not act.  Why is either of those thing cowardice?

Remember I'm not saying that they shouldn't show the cartoon; nor am I saying they should.  I'm saying it's a complicated situation, and it's for each organisation to make their own decision; and it's not cowardice if they don't.

My essential point is that you can't have it both ways: heroes are only heroes because they choose to be heroic.  If you do the brave thing because of fear of public ridicule then it wasn't heroic, it was just a different kind of cowardice.  Leave people to make these choices for themselves is all I'm saying.",null,0,null,1421334429,null,0,false,0,cnpsrzj,null,t3_2sfvax,null,t1_cnpsrzj,null,t1_cnpsc0i,null,null,null,1424862889,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

with that said, do not worry about all of the bs and the rumors and negativity that surrounds the club, inevitably, after we start the season poorly. everyone knows that we have had a rough run of things lately, but to be quite honest, we could not have played worse in that stretch of games from october to december. we really could not have played any worse, and it has gotten better...but i think it is still just the tip of the iceberg. focusing on the most important things to remember, sterling just had a break and we've been winning some games without him, marko put in motm performances and DS15 was pictured training today...im not expecting us to reach top 4 this season, or even win a cup for that matter, it is all an added bonus at this point. we just want to get as many games as possible. 

38 league + 6 Cl + 5 guaranteed matches in the league cup + 2 guaranteed (hopefully 3 if we beat bolton) guaranteed matches in fa cup + 2 guaranteed EL matches...that comes out to about 54 matches this season for the squad.

There are a number of threads from yesterday already dedicated to post-match analysis but since my comments will likely get buried there, I'll just put them here, where I suppose a lot of traffic will be at the moment.

I thought the midfield selection was interesting, and I wonder what we can divine about this weekend and the rest of the window. Before the lineups were announced, I figured Dembele would be chosen and that it would be an important game for him, another opportunity to show that he could perform without Bentaleb beside him. I imagined that another poor--or at least ineffective or indifferent--performance from him would present Pochettino with a very interesting dilemma for Saturday: stick with the indifferent Dembele or bring the inexperienced Veljkovic in. (I know which I'd prefer.) Now, Pochettino's gone and derailed that train of thought. 

I suppose the question that emerges from yesterday is if Capoue and Stambouli offer us a solution to our double pivot problems while Mason and Bentaleb are unavailable. And if they are, can we count on Capoue to come back and play another match so soon when his fitness has been a question mark in the past? Or was Pochettino actually *resting* Dembele for Saturday? And where does Veljkovic fit in?

Also, it sounds like Paulinho was fairly effective in a more advanced role, while Soldado did his usual do-most-things-well-except-score-goals. That opens up another issue. We've noted on this board before how much we're relying on Christian Eriksen (indeed, I was poking around statistics last night, and it appears we haven't won a competitive match without him on the pitch since Partizan Belgrade in November, and even then he was an unused sub. I couldn't figure out when the last time we won without him even being in the lineup; presumably during his injury spell last season.). So, obviously, we need players who can slot into that central position in the band of three to give him rest or cover. Does last night's performance suggest that Paulinho might have an opportunity there? Or, do we decide that Soldado is not actually a striker, but someone who could play that role?  

So, lots of questions for Saturday. Lineup selection that day will be very interesting. I'm not even sure what I want to see, but I am very interested to see what Pochettino decides to do.",null,0,null,1421335698,null,0,false,0,cnptf4c,null,t3_2sijta,null,t1_cnptf4c,null,t3_2sijta,null,null,null,1424862518,null,11,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,11,null

I too went from 0 experience to CBT/DAS never having sat on a bike either, been riding for a year now. First experience was day 1 on the CBT on a 50cc scooter and it was terrifying for like 10 mins. Then you settle in. This feeling returns as you go through the levels, i.e 125 geared.. 600 geared but the basics of riding stay the same, just a mental thing I reckon. 600's look bloody scary when you're messing about on your 50cc scooter ;)

I didn't practice at all before starting the cbt, used the schools bikes the whole way through the end of MOD2, only bought my first bike about 2 months after getting my full license and that's my SV650s.

Your price range is fine for either a 125 or bigger when you get your license. 

If you're worried about losing disposable income, i'll tell you now, once you start riding no income becomes 'disposable' it all goes on bike shit.. which is awesome.

What bike you get once you pass is totally up to you mate, people can advise but at the end of it all you'll get what you want and what you feel comfortable on. I'd never ridden a ""sports"" bike (seating position/clip ons etc) before I test road the SV, loved it, bought it, wrists were sore for the first month but whatever...I regret none of my decisions so far.

The training/license system in the UK is a very thorough process, which I enjoyed and I believe everyone who goes through it has a good idea of their limits by the end. You'll know if a 125, 300, 600 or 1000 is for you by the end.

Hope that helps a bit. Enjoy the experience mate. Pay attention, ride within your limits and you'll get through everything no problems.

One thing I'd like to dig more into in this piece is the following:

&gt;Many questioned Pochettino’s decision to bestow the armband on Kaboul, especially if he didn’t suit his style, but in retrospect it seems to have been quite clever. By elevating Kaboul, Pochettino has exposed him, he has allowed everyone inside and outside the dressing room to see that he doesn’t have what it takes to lead. Kaboul is unable to lead the team on the field and he is unable to lead the players into a coup d’état. Pochettino has handled a dissenting voice perfectly, AVB would do well to take note.

This is an interesting claim; if I'm reading it correctly, the idea is that allowing the team to select Kaboul as captain (and he was elected, right? Are we certain of that?) was a bit of a gambit. Pochettino essentially conceded that position to the players, hoping for one of two outcomes. Either Kaboul would take the reigns and lead the team, and he was indeed given the opportunity to do that early in the season. Or, he would demonstrate that he wasn't capable of leading them on the pitch or in the dressing room, and a new leader would emerge, or the players would begin to disregard him, putting their trust in Pochettino instead. Is that about right?

That's... a bit Machiavellian. Or maybe not; perhaps it's just a very risky strategy to pursue. I'm not sure I buy the idea that it was Pochettino's intention, because frankly it seems a high-risk approach. What if Kaboul played very poorly but remained popular in the dressing room? Or, what if Kaboul was brilliant on the pitch but contributed to a bad dressing room atmosphere? It seems a bit fortunate for Pochettino--if this was indeed his plan--that Kaboul's on- and off-pitch fortunes have been apparently the same.

I do think he should go, though. I totally agree that his time at Spurs has come to a close, for the variety of reasons as Bardi outlined.",null,0,null,1421336460,null,0,false,0,cnpttjb,null,t3_2sijsk,null,t1_cnpttjb,null,t3_2sijsk,null,null,null,1424862331,null,23,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,23,null

null,false,Conot,cnty-wales,Swansea,null,"&gt;Given that the reason they aren't doing what you ask is because they fear for their safety (otherwise why would they care about showing anything), then it absolutely is about being a hero.

a) There are reasons other then safety not to show it. One is to avoid offending viewers and thus maintain their viewership. I confess I don't know as much as I'd like to about how news stations make their money, but presumably viewership is a key component of that, and being middle of the line without risking offence would be a decent way to avoid losing any viewers.

b) The issue is that wide-spread media coverage makes it not a heroic act. If every news organization, both British and otherwise published the cartoon, there would be no ""heros"" to aim at.

I agree that the editorial staff has a choice to make there, and I wouldn't for a second think to claim they should be forced to show it. In terms of erring on the side of caution, I feel they were overcatious here. One thing is to publish the cartoon yourself (Charlie Hebdo, in this instance), another is to republish it (The Guardian), another is to show it without actively aiming to show it (which is what I would class this as if they had allowed the writer to show the image without cutting away from her). The last, and least courageous decision in my mind is to cut the writer off and immediately apologize.

Don't get me wrong, I don't work at a news organization, and I certainly imagine its a weight on  your mind to choose whether to show solidarity at potential risk to you and your colleagues lives or to not show it and risk your professional integrity.

&gt;I agree; but they didn't tell lies. And they didn't supress information. Your complaint is that they didn't stand up to terrorists -- and that isn't necesarilly their job.

I agree in part, but I do believe that it would be the morally right thing to do to stand with the Charlie Hebdo writer in solidarity, rather then to take the middle road between avoiding offense and reporting the news. This was why my (admittedly written late at night and perhaps overly emotional) original accusation was, at worst, of being apologists.

&gt;I agree there is; but if you believe in freedom at all, you should believe that you are just as free to avoid as you are to not act. Why is either of those thing cowardice?

I agree they have the decision to make, and as previously stated, they are entirely entitled to make that decision, however I do hold that its at the very least lack of courage.

I can see your point regarding cowardice of a different sort, but I feel that that is a unavoidable element. Every person may restrain their freedom of speech (or alternatively, not restrain it) based on the opinions of others. I think its important to make it clear that this isn't considered a reasonable way to react to the suppression of free speech through violence. Maybe I'm wrong, but at that point we're down to debating opinion.

Deciding for people what they're going to show or not? It's a private news channel, they do that all of the time! It's pretty much 99% of what they do, choosing stories and running with them.

How are they framing CH as offensive? If they thought CH was offensive, why would they allow a CH employee onto their channel?

My news station? I'm not Rupert Murdoch (thankfully), what makes it my news station?

They're failing to tell the real story just because they didn't show an illustration? Are they writing children's books and need to be mostly pictures with very little text or something?

Might sound exaggerated? It is - they had a story on the issue, they invited a guest from the magazine onto their channel and broadcast that story on their channel, and because they made a choice not to show the cartoon, people are acting like ISIS are now in control of the West!

null,false,bawbawbaw1,,Belfast,null,"Homelessness is kind of my ""speciality"" for research and I've worked in a lot of hostels over the years and read tons of papers but I can only go by what I know. Maybe the OP will find it useful, maybe they won't. Its an area that isn't very well researched in NI and even QUB have just started teaching social work students about it (which is kind of shocking in itself). 

Its very difficult to count the homeless population, people tend to move around a lot (for a whole load of reasons, that could be a PhD in itself) or might only be homeless for days or weeks. Then there is the question of what is homelessness - is it just rough sleepers, or people living in hostel, or do you count people sofa surfing? They might not be registered as homeless either. Someone sitting in a hostel with a big drink problem and who have been sleeping rough on and off for 20+ years is no more or less homeless than someone who has lost their job, mortgage and spending their first night in a hostel. 

The biggest causation I've come across is relationship breakdown, by a long shot. My own data at the time gave out similar results to other research. Then there are factors that influence why relationships break down, like you say, drug and alcohol abuse is a reason but not the only one obviously. 

If its for university then they need to re-word their survey in a big way, I can't see what its going to answer that hasnt been answered before. Qualitative research works well with this subject, mainly because of definitions of homelessness I talked about at the start. I can't imagine trying to do a quantitative study, it would be very difficult to collect worthwhile data and some researchers who have tried (in NI) haven't been very successful. A lot of homeless people will refuse to answer anything, theres no rapport, no trust built up, they tend to distrust researchers quite a bit actually because they think the information will be used against them somehow. 

If the OP (or anyone else whos interested) wants to know what academic papers are worth looking at on the subject then let me know and I'll put up a list.

For example, I am not an alcoholic. It takes a bit of willpower to refuse a drink, but really, I have never had any troubles there. But I know that if an alcoholic was offered a drink and refused they would have had to use a great deal more willpower than me. Even though our actions are the same, the amount of willpower it takes for us is different.

Things take different amounts of willpower for everyone. For people with anorexia, eating takes a shit ton of willpower, whereas refusing to eat is much easier. For fat people it's the opposite. For people who are depressed, getting out of bed can take a huge amount of willpower, for other people, it barely takes any. For people who smoke, refusing a cigarette can take a huge amount of willpower, whereas for someone like me, it literally takes nothing.

Totally, but the issue is it occurs in an international arena and not sure how much weight there is to block Monsato. I think the key issue is that they end up owning the production of food, and can fine people for using seeds the year after.

So farmers in developing rural areas will buy seeds in for their benefits of better yields or whatever, but can only use them for that year and then have no money to buy new seeds the next year, and can't use the ones as they only had a certain license. 

Also a large issue is that in the international field in general, local knowledge is ignored in favour of new technology. Quite a few instances of villages/areas basically being ruined because their previously sustainable diverse range of food growing had been replaced with 'Green Deal' type monocultures which then failed.

Sure, it's pretty slow, but that is the only drawback and since I'm a very patient person that just doesn't bother me. It's not a pleasure ride for me, it's my only vehicle and it has to take a lot of shit (especially in this weather). I've had a 600cc in the past, but I got rid of it because it was too tall and top heavy for me and it knocked my confidence.

Based on my experience I'd recommend starting on a 125. Hit up gumtree and find a Ybr, cbr, yzf or something like that second hand. You can pick up a ybr in decent nick for £500-£700. If you buy a 2.5k bike and drop it, or it's just not for you, you're gonna have a bad time. I dropped my fazer 3 times before I sold it on, and that cost me (Granted I am a grade A idiot). A solid second hand 125cc should retain it's value if you're nice to it and you can learn your own maintenance on it easy peasy because parts are cheap and there's really nothing to them. Also, your insurance will be cheaper. Basically, if you fuck up it's not a major deal in terms of cost.

On the other hand, a good 500-600cc might suit you better if you can afford the insurance and initial costs. If you choose this route I'd still recommend second hand and I'd also suggest you sit on as many bikes as humanly possible to get an idea of what you like first. Go with a popular model. You want to do a lot more research with bigger bikes because they cost more and you don't want to end up with something you don't like the feel of. Ask your cbt instructor, they're usually pretty keen for a bit of bike shopping and can run you through your options and maybe even let you sit on a variety of bikes.

I mean, either way you're going to want to upgrade sooner or later (who doesn't?) a 125 will keep you happy for maybe a year, and a 500 might keep you happy for 2 or 3, but I guarantee you'll be window shopping for your perfect bike as soon as you pass your test. Just plan accordingly, buy second hand first time around incase you scratch it or drop it or hate it and keep it clean and tidy and running well.

If you're freelancing with a lot of different clients and have a lot of expenses, then an accountant is absolutely worth it, and I've recently started using a book-keeper as well. My time is charged out at £45/hour. So let's say it takes me 2 hours/month to do book keeping (lots of different clients, increasing amounts of overheads for hosting and licensing costs and stuff), and 8 hours/year for filing SA. That's 32 hours a year, or £1440 of chargeable time where I could be getting paid to do my actual job (or I could be sleeping, or having time off, or whatever).

So I could realistically pay £1000/year for accountancy fees and still be OK about it. In reality, it's much much less than this, and then I get the extra benefit of my accountant knowing the system well enough that he knows things I can claim that I wouldn't otherwise think of (percentages of bills and rent, that kind of stuff).

For violent criminals with severe mental health issues jail is cheaper and anyway when they are at that point the ""hospitals"" are pretty much jails anyway.

""Non-violent"" prisoners is something he bands about a lot without definition which is incredibly different. Does he mean people in for non-violent crimes or people with no record of violence in custody or does that mean both. Important difference there.

Anyway I still maintain based on experience, UK jails do not operate in the same way as US jails. Very different rules, methods, priorities and different problems faced.

I would argue that more needs to be done to prevent reoffending (but thats expensive) and the key to reduce offending is education, mental health care, employment and social service intervention in childhood but those things are very expensive.

The state-owned train company that carries Britain's nuclear waste is set to carry paying passengers as the UK's railway network struggles with soaring demand.

Direct Rail Services, a subsidiary of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority that operates freight trains, is expected to start services along the west Cumbrian coast within weeks under a government-brokered deal.

Northern Rail, which operates the local franchise in Cumbria, will hire the trains, financed by the DfT, and collect tickets.

DRS drivers will operate the locomotives until Northern can train its own staff.

TransPennine Express, which operates intercity services between Liverpool and Newcastle, is losing several trains to Chiltern Railways because it has only a year left on its franchise.

Under the government deal, the DfT will pay TransPennine to rent some newer diesel trains from Northern, which are being freed up by the electrification of the Liverpool-Manchester line.

Northern will be paid by the DfT to hire DRS trains.

In any event, the justification for banning 'realistic visual records' of court proceedings (except where dispensation is granted) is generally given as a combination of the following:

- interferes with the privacy of all parties - which can cause embarrassment for the victim in some crimes,and irreparable damage to the reputation of the accused in others.
- increases the hesitancy on the part of any witnesses who fear either ridicule, reprisals or public condemnations depending on their connection to the crime in question.
- trivialises the Justice System as a whole by creating an implicit association in the public mind (whether consciously or not) with legal proceedings and entertainment. The public are never (and honestly could and should never be) totally satisfied with the judiciary in any case, so exacerbating that effect is held to be a very bad thing.
- undermines the perceived independence of jurors - even if jurors aren't themselves depicted, the presence and awareness of public scrutiny is held to lead to jurors placing less importance on their own conclusions based on the facts presented to them, and more on the expectations they imagine the public hold for how someone *should* be judged.

If the rumours are true, and Baldi is assuming they are, it appears that the only reason this approach worked was because Kaboul, Ade, et al overstepped their boundaries to the point that Poche *had no choice* but to step in, and benched them.

Those two started every league match until the apparent dressing room bust up after Stoke, which required Poche to choose sides, and fortunately he chose the right side (Kane and others) to the detriment of his captain and vice-captain, Kaboul and Ade, as well as apparently Lennon and Capoue.

Had he taken a more direct approach instead of this Machiavellian set-them-up-to-fail-spectacularly method, we could have avoided 10 weeks of watching Kaboul and Ade continuously fail to deliver.

The next day I did my theory.

The day after that I went back to speak to the guy about doing DAS. Told him I couldn't really get full day lessons in because of working shifts, so he squeezed half days in over the space of 4 weeks.

First day half of the lesson was back on the 125, until he was sure I'd be ok on the 600, then when I sat on the 600 it just felt right. Because of my size, the heavier, bigger bike suited me way more. I also found handling easier on it, the ybr was way too small for me.

Did mod1 5 weeks after never having sat on a bike and passed with zero faults, and if I'd have passed my mod2 first time (failed for two stupid reasons), that would have been 6 weeks exactly between CBT and passing.

It makes a lot more sense to me that Pochettino allowed the players to elect their own captains at the outset because he didn't know the squad and wanted the players invested in one another. However, when those senior players produced indifferent results and perhaps even resisted his training methods and game plans, he found himself in a new situation, in which it made the most sense to assert his dominance irrespective of the captain's position, and to play the team that was buying into his methods and plan the most. The fact that this has produced more positive results has vindicated his actions, but I don't think there's much more to it than that.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;They were talking about all this nonsense with Julian Dicks during the Schalke match about ""Young players making mistakes and learning from them."" Dicks quite rightly said something along the lines of ""If what he's done is true, thats not a mistake. While i don't condone it a mistake is getting into your car after one too many. He's bringing the club into disrepute."" 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;He's had chances some kids only dream of and blessed with the talent to go with it. Fuck him and move on.


 &gt;**[+3] herofix**: 
&gt;&gt;There have been 16 different posters on this thread, and every one of them with the implied belief that Ravel Morrison is guilty.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A Not Guilty verdict is a possibility we can at least entertain.  And I'm hoping he hasn't done these things.

You seem to believe that sticking to a diet is a question of ""just doing it"".  The problem is quite obviously sticking to a calorific loss for a prolonged period of time, and then maintaining that for life.

They're not the army.  Why do they have to be your shield?

&gt; So ask yourself. Do you want to f live as a slave to bigotry. 

You seem to have missed my point -- I don't think they should be prevented from showing whatever they want.  But if you grant them the freedom to show what they want, then you grant them the freedom to not show what they want -- for whatever reasons.  If that reason is fear for their employees, then it's not your right to tell them who should be endangered and who shouldn't.

It's especially easy for keyboard warriors on reddit to tell them that they're the ones who should stand up to the aggression, but ask yourself if you would still think so if it was you who was the reporter on screen at the time?  What if it was your spouse?  Your child?  Would you be as quick to tell them to be brave then?

If so -- great; but you can't possibly not see that that choice is not the clearest in the world, and that others might not think in quite as unnuanced a fashion as yourself.

&gt; ""Yes, I explained last week, he's nearly ready for selection,"" said Pochettino. ""He's training in the last few weeks; **his training sessions have been very good**.""

Pochettino's discussing whether a player will make it back into the squad and instead of mentioning the player's skills or abilities, he mentions that the player has been working hard in training. That's what it comes down to for him. We've pretty much known that for a while, but this just reinforces that fact.

If you are within the fixed term of your tenancy then the landlord is not able to increase the rent unless you agree to it, or the increase is included in the agreement (this must be specific, you cannot agree to an increase of an unspecified amount)

If you are not within the fixed term of your tenancy (and I would assume not since you've been there 10 years) your landlord can increase the rent once a year, but this must still be a fair increase. Please post anything your tenancy agreement says about rent increases as you may have agreed a specific procedure for increasing the rent.

If this isn't the case, you haven't agreed and do not agree with the increase the landlord must serve you with a one month notice that he is increasing the rent. When the landlord gives you this notice you can appeal it.

Lots of good info here: https://www.gov.uk/private-renting/rent-increases and the following page for disputes.

Shelter also have an excellent advice line (free) 0808 800 4444

If your house has mould, the landlord isn't fufilling his responsibilities. It sounds like the house may also be a House of Multiple Occupation (HMO) which are strictly licensed, you should check to see that it is as he may have skipped on essential safety features. Your local council will have a team that is able to help you in this situation, they're usually in the environmental health department or housing standards. They will also be able to advise re. your rent increase.

Please don't not pay your rent, you must follow a very specific procedure in order to be able to withhold rent for repairs. If you want to do this phone shelter or ask your local council, if all else fails post here.

Your landlord may choose to evict you.. If this is the case and you have rent arrears it will limit the options available to you if you need housing assistance from the council.
