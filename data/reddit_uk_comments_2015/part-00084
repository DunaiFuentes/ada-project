The  downsides are:

1. Could be a few thousand pounds more or year to do a foundation year (but hey it's not like it's cheap to go to uni now anyway). 

2. Some graduate schemes require excellent A-level grades as well as a 2:1/1st for degree (because they get so many applications they can filter them easier like this)

3. It's a bit embarrassing the explain that you did a foundation year for x or y reasons. The only course it's totally acceptable and expected to do one is art.

In any case it put me in a good place for my degree. I got all the required knowledge I needed to get a 1st overall at the end of 4 years. I would put the foundation year on par with a difficult college course but not as hard as A2s (from a science perspective).

Should also not that my foundation year (in computer science) was 1/3 of the price of a full year at uni. Sorry for you if the price has gone up so much.

&gt; Too many people are being priced out of their homes due to a lack of social rented homes and
skyrocketing private rents. House prices rose 10% in 2014.3

Ok, there is an assertion that it is a lack of social rented homes, rather than just the cost of the private sector being too high, due to supply and demand.  Myself I'd rather see ample housing stock of all levels, we don't want to end up with a gulf like you have in say Singapore as I fear our sociopolitical system would generate a big class divide there.

Anyway, they say house prices rose in 10%, this isn't from land registry, it's from a website article, which when followed talks about how the ONS stats aren't even in.... It's absurd.  You wouldn't write a paper like this.

Next up, they take the politics section of the Guardian, which isn't renowned as a bastion of numerical accuracy.  A cursory glance at the article suggests those figures came from DCLG, why not go straight to the official source?

Then after that, they suggest that private building isn't working with a link to the staggers....  Seriously?  That article even contains opinion that it is due to planning regulations constraining this.  We get a statement like this

&gt;and is not interested in meeting
the urgent need for affordable rented homes

Which isn't backed up by the article used as a source.  This to me is citation laundering, they've got what is effectively an opinion at best.

At least they got reference 11 in the right place, as the sentence after that is most definitely a [citation needed] as one of the benefits of using private capital in BTL scenarios is the fact it requires no upfront government expenditure, parties like that because it gives them money to spend on pensioners and the NHS.

&gt;We will also reform property and land taxes to curb speculation and excessive demand, bring more
empty homes back into use and convert empty municipal buildings where appropriate, provide tenants
with much greater security of tenure and stabilising rent controls, diversify the building industry, insist
that landlords improve the energy efficiency of their homes, and begin to rebalance economic
prosperity in the UK to reduce demand in London and the south east. 

Ooh this sounds interesting, this is an ""in detail"" document can't wait to understand these plans.

&gt; Details of these policies will be in
our full manifesto.


Oh that old chestnut!

Onto the next page.

So the table shows a tapering in of the extra funding, by £1bn per year.  Ok, they are going to explain this right?  

&gt;We take a conservative estimate of a £4.5 billion annual saving from the
overall reforms by 2017 (see table above).

Ok still not sure why they are expecting more revenue from those reforms after they've been introduced for two years, also not sure how they expect it to start in 2015, which tax year do they mean I wonder?  Is that the tapering?  It's guessing time in the *detailed document* once more.  So no explanation at all.

Hmm.  As is, landlords net off interest against other income, I wouldn't be surprised if we see all kinds of inventive ways of structuring towards companies.  Companies of course are taxed only on profit, not gross revenue (VAT notwithstanding), the real question I suppose is how leveraged the BTL industry is.  Some statistics on that would have been useful, it's worth pointing at that commercial mortgage rates have dropped a bit since 2010, thanks in part due to QE and such.

So no, this offers no detail, it doesn't explain how they will buy the land, what kind of dwelling they are building, how it will work at a local authority level (does Newcastle get as much as London per sqm?) or basically any questions at all.  It also sadly doesn't deal with my personal biggest concern, that the property market crashing sharply could result in a brand new liquidity crisis and recession, and how they will ensure a controlled deflation.",null,0,null,1425493906,null,0,false,0,cp4ansh,null,t3_2xwrld,null,t1_cp4ansh,null,t1_cp49854,null,null,null,1427577965,null,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21,null

It's not banning it though. Thats the thing. Nowhere does it say it is banned. It's not being sold from council buildings.

&gt; Not for everyone. Some people see it as an evil thing that represents the deaths of their families.

Fair enough.

&gt; No one is making it inflammatory but you.

There are people here, without a doubt, that wear them politically. Don't forget fleggers exist - they exist solely to shout about Britain and their Britishness, don't think they won't use a poppy to exude more about how proud to be British they are etc etc, while being total apologists for British Army atrocities here.

&gt; Also what defines a community

In my response, I meant a community as in a neighbourhood. Kilwilkie, Mourneview or Taghnaven in Lurgan - Tigers Bay, Sandy Row, Shankill in Belfast etc. Outside of NI obviously it wouldn't be split so 50/50 down the political/religious divide, but that's NI for you.

&gt; in Northern Ireland the majority would support it why not decree they can be sold everywhere here?

It's equality. Council/Government buildings are no longer selling poppies *or* Easter lilys - neutral ground now, shared space.

&gt; I've said a thousand times for most it's a sign of respect for the dead.

Maybe a sign of respect to the dead, but it helps the living financially. Those who killed my family are still out there, and still haven't been in front of a judge, therefore they benefit from it.

I felt the standard of teaching is higher there, the quality of the mandated requirements certainly is.

One hour of wet in a 172 cost me about 60% of what it did in the UK.  One hour of instruction cost about one tenth.  The USA has a glut of low hour instructors (most airlines want 1000 hours, a good way to get them, is by instructing, so really you are paying him to build hours, the training is almost free).

Now because I'm also a cynical type, I'd say never, ever pay upfront £8k for a training course, schools have gone bust.  I actually set up a US bank account just so I could pay as I flew out there, the school understood my concerns in that regard as it was during the recession over there.

So my advice would be get the visa, go to the states, perfect weather.  I did mine in under three weeks, I'd had a couple of hours of instruction before, but I passed in 6 minutes past minimum which is rare, so much so the school had less than ten students do that before, so YMMV, you probably want to set aside 6 weeks if you can.  My secret was to study hard, I'd read *Stick and Rudder* about three times, and committed most of the syllabus text to memory.  I flew 1 hour twice a day, almost every day, only once was the weather not perfect.

So $6k isn't even £4k in real money right now, and the quality of many schools that do FAA is really excellent.",null,0,null,1425494852,null,0,false,0,cp4ba0e,null,t3_2xroq7,null,t1_cp4ba0e,null,t1_cp4amcq,null,null,null,1427578253,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

**Guzan - 7**. Little to do, not at fault for the goal. Flapped a bit for one cross if I recall but foul was given. 

**Hutton - 8**. Was solid, really good going forward. A key player for us. On the flip side, probably should have been sent off.

**Clark - 9**. My MoM. Won everything in the air. Was a class act the whole game.

**Okore - 6**. Take a look at the goal we conceded. It was his man, and he actually looked scared going for the ball. Was also a little dodgy at other stages of the game. Worrying.

**Lowton - 8**. Kept trying to go on his right foot. Some wayward passes. Was completely out of position for one attack in the 2nd half when a West Brom defender (cant remember who and dont care) was on the edge of our box. Fortunately someone intercepted the cross (clark again?). Won a penalty though and is not a LB. Deserved the 8 all things considered.

**Delph - 8**. Was up for it, looked like he was left wing for a lot of the game but he was all over the pitch. Hit the post. Constantly created space and took pressure off as a result.

**Cleverly - 7**. I just don't know what he does. There's no one thing that he excels at. Same in this match, nothing stands out.

**Westwood - 7**. Moved the ball well and made a couple of decent interceptions / tackles but for someone who is in the team for passing ability, I do remember a couple of passes that didn't make it.

**N'Zogbia - 6**. One of his better games. Not capable though.

**Agbonlahor - 9**. Also a 9 with Clark. Would have gotten MoM if he scored the one on one (that should have been a penalty). Typical Gabby, his second touch was a tackle cause his first was so poor.

**Benteke - 8**. He looked up for up too but is still a shadow of the beast we knew last season. Cool penalty, worth an 8.



**Grealish - 7**. Needed to get into the game more, not enough touches but when he did get it, he looked better than his last appearance.

2) Damages (a sum to make good the wrong that has been done)

3) Costs (the money the winner needed to spend to defend/bring the case)


The court doesn't give out fines - although damages *can* be punitive, the general principle of the English &amp; Welsh civil law is that the parties are left in the position where they would have been had the dispute not happened; the spectre of massive damages awarded by juries in the states hasn't come to pass here.

The court does have some powers of punishment, but they relate to parties holding the court in contempt (wilfully ignoring or breaching orders by the courts, generally) which can involve fines and/or prison time.

Fortunately it was a smallish dear so didn't do much damage (was only driving a Micra, so very lucky), but bent the door, smashed the headlight, needed a bit of welding.

Anyway I pulled over just round the corner and when I got back to the scene there were two hysterical crying women dialing 999 to report this half dead deer while I was just wondering back calling 101. Crappy signal in the forest meant I could barely hear the woman on the other end, but eventually she told me that I could leave the scene if I wanted to but silly me offered to wait as the deer was flailing about in the road.

Cut to about 40mins later and a police car showed up with the Verderer to put a bullet through the things head. Anyway this is where things got weird because another police car shows up and the two coppers walk over to me and tell me that ""I do not have to say anything. But it may harm my defence... blah blah"" Turns out my MOT had expired months ago and I got a £100.00 fine which then prompted them to inspect my cars ""roadworthyness"" and issue me with a VDRS for balding tyres.

Section 6. [**In contemporary thought**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite#In_contemporary_thought) of article  [**Luddite**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The title Luddite developed a secondary meaning: a ""Luddite"" is a term describing those opposed to, or slow to adopt or incorporate into their lifestyle, [industrialisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialisation), [automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation), [computerisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_computer_system) or new [technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology) in general.  In 1956, there is a parliamentary speech that said 'Organised workers were by no means wedded to a Luddite Philosophy'. 

&gt;More recently, the term [Neo-Luddism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Luddism) has emerged to describe opposition to many forms of technology.  According to a manifesto drawn up by the Second Luddite Congress (April 1996; Barnesville, Ohio), Neo-Luddism is ""a leaderless movement of passive resistance to consumerism and the increasingly bizarre and frightening technologies of the Computer Age.""  

&gt;Economists apply the term ""Luddite fallacy"" to the notion that [technological unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment) leads to [structural unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_unemployment) (and is consequently macroeconomically injurious). If a technological innovation results in a reduction of necessary labour inputs in a given sector, then the industry-wide cost of production falls, which lowers the competitive price and increases the equilibrium supply point which, theoretically, will require an increase in aggregate labour inputs.

This doesn't surprise me. I used public transport for several years when I was younger. Now I don't to start with its the same price for me as running a car (yeah figure that out).

From what I remember.

1. Trains never ran on time.

2. Connections never connected. Mostly because of point number 1. So you left standing around waiting for the next service to come along.

3. It was wildly busy. At rush hour times so no seat really hot / smelly in the summer.

4. There is nowhere to dump a car where you can then get a bus to Belfast for example. The reason this is required is because of point 2.

5. Their routes suck. Hub and spoke doesn't work for many reasons. Currently where I work I would have to get a bus into the middle of Bangor. Then Bus / Train into the middle of belfast. Then back out to airport road west. The approx time it takes is around 1 hour 30 mins (often longer because of point no. 1 and 2 which actually make it 2 hours.). vs my 15-20 minutes drive. I spend £20 on fuel in the car each week doing that. But the weekly tick for the train from bangor to belfast is £34. So it seems fine if you are going from a ""center"" of town X to the center of town Y. Then it does actually work.

6. If you actually used the train to say go from Bangor to Belfast as an example it costs £5.50 for a 1 time fare. However if you get 4 people and put them in a taxi the taxi only costs £20 often you get an even better deal if you have a 6 seater taxi. With the added obvious bonus of being picked up and dropped where you want to go with no waiting on a cold platform.

7. I just looked up the fares on the site while writing this and apparently a ""Day return"" for a train is cheaper than buying the bulk ""Weekly ticket"" yeah go figure that out translink .... Source: https://www.translink.co.uk/Services/NI-Railways/Fares/ and put in Bangor -&gt; Great Vic Street.

8. From what I remember about buying tickets. You would enter a train station and buy a ticket. Then walk 6 feet where another member of staff would check your ticket. Then you would get your ticket checked on the train then you would have it checked a 3rd time when you get off the train. Often there would be one guy checking tickets and 4-5 more behind him watching him. Nothing like feeling ""hassled""

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"OK I  had BT Infinity &amp; I can tell you somethings about it after cancelling within my 14 days fair use.

First don't presume that BT infinity is fiber optic, it's mostly not. BT infinity is described as ''super fast internet''. To be described as super fast internet it must break speeds of 16mb/s at off peak so from 1am to 11am weekdays and it must be faster than 8mb/s most of the time on peak such as weekends, a lot of standard net will already do this.

What BT infinity really is, is a premium adsl broadband, ie you pay a lot more to Q jump your neighbours in traffic sharing &amp; buy more of their broad band width. This works well in areas where you are the only infinity customer but where many people are doing the same then it all cancels out.

I was getting around 9 mb/s download and 1 upload with infinity which was actually less than what I was getting with sky. I was supposed to pay around 6x the price for this. One good thing with BT is their customer relations, I told the engineer my speed &amp; questioned why the engineer had not laid fiber in my house and he just pretty much came clean and explained the above stating I would be just as well off with regular internet for a fraction of the price.

In some areas BT infinity is true fiber optic, the easiest way to tell if you can get fiber optic is to see if Virgin fibre optic is available in your area as they won't try sell you priority broadband dressed as fiber optic ''super fast internet'' like BT does. If Virgin is not available due to lack of fibre cables in your street then your BT infinity will just be the same broad band you are getting now but you'll get priority in trafficking for a much higher line rental and subscription. 

It's like being able to drive in a bus lane, ace when you are the only person doing it but the more people who pay for the privilege then the more it becomes like a normal slow &amp; congested lane.

If you want true fibre optic you have to wait for them to lay the cable and it will require an engineer visit to lay the cable in your house, if you want priority net then sure go with BT infinity but its pretty hit or miss how many other people are paying the premium in your area, so you will either get noticeably different speeds or pretty much the same even slower is sometimes possible,

No indication that this was the case. Almost as if there was some sort of assessment.

&gt;And what is this? DWP and Atos hassling someone with mental health problems? Definitely had nothing to do with exacerbating them.

Hassling. Oh yes. These people who killed themselves rather than even go to an assessment are clearly being hassled. These people who miss appointments and then get a letter are obviously being hassled. If a teenager skips school and then a letter gets sent home is that 'hassling'?

&gt;No please do go on, because as we all know you cherry picked the ones you could at least try to come up with a response to.

How about the one of the guy who they are claiming had a heart attack with no other cause than DWP? Or the schizophrenic? Or the one who had terminal cancer? What about the one with a degenerative lung condition?

&gt;The pertinent issue is that they were mentally ill and pursued in a way which made it worse. I'm sure you aren't so stupid, so you are feigning ignorance - why?

Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Can you give me a comprehensive list of the ways in which mental illness can be 'made worse'?

I'm seriously suggesting that the £80k is a pragmatic amount that represents the loss of future earnings, the distress to his family by having his name dragged through the mud by the media not to mention the fact that he's been suspended for two years, plus all the other negative impacts this sort of thing is likely to have on his career. It's far more nuanced than suggesting that £80k represents 'loss of earnings'.

The damages are a small multiple of his annual salary, which is hardly excessive considering the nature of the case. Don't forget that Mitchell has had the opportunity to go to trial and declined - both parties (on the basis of some very well qualified legal advice, I am sure) have decided that the £80k + undisclosed costs represents a fair and equitable settlement. 

Mitchell's team are hardly going to propose a figure that would be more than the courts would be likely to award - that would simply be madness. Equally (given that the facts have already been decided) Rowland's team are hardly going to settle on a lowball figure when they can cheerfully say ""see you in court"".

null,false,PappyPoobah,lfc12,,null,"SECOND HALF:

46': Lee Mason with some whistle troubles. No halftime changes for either team.

48': Coutinho with a shot from the right side. Heaton snatches it up.

48': Migs thinking he's Neuer, comes out for a header against Barnes. Wins the header, but Barnes is down with a pretty good knock.

51': Great ball in from Hendo to Sturridge, who puts it in the net!!!!!

51': Liverpool 2 - 0 Burnley

52': Burnley substitution. Wallace on for Knightly.

Other news, Spurs are up 3-1 against Swansea; Arsenal up 1-0 against QPR, United still tied with Newcastle.

57': Ings gets in behind Lovren and Skrtel picks up the pieces, putting it out for Burnley throw.

58': Liverpool looking a little shakey in the midfield, lots of balls getting through.

60': Barnes with a good shot, down low to the left of goal, though.

61': Liverpool breaks, cross from Sterling falls to Moreno. First time shot goes wide left.

62': Burnley set piece on right side after foul from Moreno. Migs collects the cross.

63': Really hoping Anfield gets a new pitch soon. Players slipping all over the place today.

64': Sturridge with a shot from about 25 out. Poor effort sails over the goal.

Arsenal up 2-0 against QPR now.

66': Burnley substitution. Vokes on for Barnes.

67': Lovren makes a poor decision, passes to Migs with a man on. Ball cleared out after Migs collects a cross.

69': Mee foul on Sterling on right corner of 18. Free kick Liverpool.

70': Good ball in from Hendo but Heaton collects easily.

72': Kolo on for Moreno after Allen is fouled near the half.

75': Ings almost in but Migs collects it inches before Ings taps it in.

QPR gets one against Arsenal, but unlikely to get a tie with game in stoppage time. United net one against Newcastle. Horrible play from Newcastle defense gives Young an easy tap in. Someday their luck will run out, right?

79': Can with a break and hits a volley to the bottom right. Saved by Heaton.

United somehow get the win, Spurs 3-2 Swansea, Arsenal 2-1 QPR.

82': Burnley corner and a poor clearance gives Burnley a good chance. Fluffed shot gets cleared.

83': Glen Johnson on for Sturridge. Liverpool lining up defensively to keep the clean sheet and win.

84': How does Can have so much energy? Makes a massive run back to defend vs. Mee. Mee with a foul and gets a yellow.

84': Yellow card - Mee

Spurs beat Swansea 3-2.

90': Lambert on for Sterling.

92': Burnley playing lots of long balls to no avail.

93': Allen with a high kick. Last minute free kick for Burnley.

94': Free kick high and wide. Full time.",null,0,null,1425500564,null,0,1425506705,0,cp4ezkw,null,t3_2xxvk1,null,t1_cp4ezkw,null,t3_2xxvk1,null,null,null,1427579984,null,112,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,112,null

Having said that, I'm not sure I buy the niche argument to that extent anyway. There are plenty of commercially-made historical documentaries (most are fairly cheap to make) and much of the BBC's programming that is widely purported to be it's raison d'etre (such as the epic Attenborough nature series) is commercially successful on Worldwide, suggesting that it's commercially viable programming anyway.

Frankly, the only stuff I see the BBC putting out (in terms of TV programming) that you doesn't have similar commercially-made alternatives are the occasional BBC4 shows about fairly obscure artists/musicians/etc. As I said, they could keep making these even if they had a subscription model, but I'm not sure about the argument for subsidising it (particularly from a non-progressive source of funds) anyway.

It's due to people not caring back in the 60s and 70s and just chucking stuff in a pool or building, something which was widespread across all industries at the time.

Decommissioning on other UK sites is going rather well, which is why you never hear about it.

When Calder Hall, Magnox and AGR plants were built nobody thought as to how they would be dismantled. New build plants are built with decommissioning in mind, so they're a lot easier to dismantle and create less waste the operator also has to pay into a fund during the plant's lifetime to cover decommissioning costs.

Many people are opposed to nuclear power whilst knowing very little about it other than they think it's bad. If you're interested in decommissioning, read up about it, before spewing nonsense.

Last place I rented, we knew we wanted it before we even looked (based on the location, photos, the fact it was only a few years old etc and that it was the best place on the market for the price by miles), we booked a viewing just to make sure it all checked out.
The day of the viewing the agent said she would have to cancel as the company car was double booked, we insisted we wanted to see it that afternoon as we had arranged leaving work early etc so she had to get a taxi across town in rush hour! I felt a bit of a bastard but I guarantee they would have had X amount of viewings the next morning and it would have been snapped up. The amount of time's I'd arranged to view something and asked for the earliest slot, which was 3 days away, by which time it was taken, was ridiculous! So frustrating.

Another place I've rented I've taken it on the spot, then had to walk out the house with the agent and stand there while she told another couple waiting outside to view that we had just taken it. They were not happy, but hey, it's dog eat dog out there in the rental market.

I'm worried about the future of the country - our kids are going to be screwed either way. Globalisation and technology are going to hit them hard, as a technologist in London, I see it first hand and I really worry

I feel like Labour mainly represents the short-term interests of corrupt government unions. I'd like to vote Lib Dem, because I agree with 90% of what they say, but I can't reward Nick's inability to stand up for himself. The Tories feed a capitalist monster that feeds the rest of us. Maybe some short term pain is better in the long run... If UKIP can convince me we won't need Europe, then I'll listen but I've yet to hear them make sense.

Sterling gets the ball on the right wing and sizes up a Burnley player. He plays it past them to Sturridge and keeps running.

Sterling receives the ball and tracks down the white line on the right of the box. He cuts it back to Sturridge who's now running square, avoiding about three Burnley defenders. One tries a challenge, Sturridge plays a one-two round him with Lallana on the edge of the box.

You need to get your CV as smart as possible. Someone here has said post it here for input. You can pay people to help work on your cv if you don't have anyone knowledgeable you can go to. This should be your first step.

Next, rinse your contacts. Ask around or get your parents to ask around all their friends. 

Make sure you're doing quality applications to jobs rather than quantity. Tailor your cv and experience to each application, don't just send the same CV to all applications.

Temp agencies are probably your best way in. All my friends in office jobs started in temp roles that progressed after 1-2 years into permanent positions and promotions. 

Make a list of the bigger companies in your area and check directly with their sites or their hr dept about any vacancies as they may not always be listed on job sites or with agencies. 

You might want to read up on interview techniques and best practice and maybe get someone to give you a mock interview/roleplay just to make sure you're confident enough with that situation and not doing anything obviously off putting.

The rest is persistence. My friend recently had 1 year, 6 months to get into an office job. She's now a manager at that company on nearly £30k a year. Took her 2 years working there to get in that position, so waiting will pay off eventually. She volunteered for a charity doing admin too, so this is a really sensible move! Well done! :) Keep it up.

I then tried the manufacturer who said they would replace it f.o.c. for me, but had to get the stick back from SCAN. Advised Scan that i would never accept the amount they were wanting to refund )as they would get a full refund from the manufacturer) and to return it as it was my property, but they said they had lost my joystick!! - in the end they gave me a full refund, but has put me off buying from them ever again.

The media might not appear supportive at the moment, but public opinion itself is changing (about to sleep so no sources, but the majority of polls all reflect an upswing in support) - and I think, as you've mentioned, America's progress is going to complement that. 

Let's say the US ends up decriminalising at the very least, or even legalising at the federal level. That will - considering just how much attention spills over already - in my opinion force the UK into a true debate on whether, how, and when, to legalise.

Even if by then we've got a strong right-wing government who have no plans to allow a referendum, I believe the positive (or even just neutral) effects will start to show. More and more people will start to understand that whilst it doesn't necessarily benefit a recreational user, the level of harm (laziness, negative mental health for users prone to mental health issues) doesn't warrant prohibition.

Sorry for rambling, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that we don't live in a walled garden anymore. The Internet has allowed for a cultural parity between the UK and the US.

Okore - 6 - Lacks a bit of confidence, made some mistakes, also made at least one good last-man tackle.  
  
Clark - 9 - Commanding performance. Looks a proper Premier League player now.  
  
Lowton - 8 - Great going forward, seemed to have a good bit of understanding with Delph, who dropped in to cover him on occasion. In the right place at the end to win the penalty. Clearly not used to playing on the left, though.  
  
Westwood - 6 - Nothing special, but I guess that's just how he plays. Kept things ticking over well enough.  
  
Cleverley - 8 - Good energy, played some good passes, and helped press the fuck out of WBA's midfielders.  
  
Delph - 8 - Best performance for weeks. Did a bit of everything in the middle, almost scored as well. Captain's armband suits him.

null,false,lovechip,null,null,null,"Hi! I used to work on the widening participation team at my uni. This was in West London so the schools we were going out to were particularly tricky. I mentored a lot of young people to help them clarify what they wanted to achieve and help them work out if uni was the right thing for them, so I understand this side of it.

The people we saw often were stuck in their area with low expectations of themselves, surrounded by similar friends and family members who didn't understand university and what it had to offer. University is so much more than just your degree. The people you meet, the contacts and friends and all the extra-curricular things on offer just broaden your entire life experience out. If you feel ready for this and want to get out of the narrow place you're in, the resources at university are the way to go.

Quite honestly, further down the line, if you do well at uni, your A-level grades don't matter so much. My fiancee is a great example. He's super smart, but not many people would have thought so. He got Ds and Es at A-level because the type of learning just didn't suit him. By the end of uni he won a prize for best dissertation (in medical biology) and skipped an MA to go and do a paid PhD at one of the top universities in the world. He decided it wasn't for him and spent a few years doing web development. He now runs his own company that just turned over £250,000 in the first year and is back working for that same university he was doing his PhD at with a chance of undertaking a new PhD in ... welll...... something computery/data related. His A-level grades didn't hold him back at all. He went to uni and made the most of it. He also changed degree during his undergrad which meant he was at uni for 5 years. :)

It ultimately comes down to what you want to do. There's nothing inherently wrong with either path, but just don't limit yourself based on fear or worry of what could go wrong. Look at what each option has to offer and what potential each path holds.

I have no faith in the man anymore. Whether we stay up or not, whether we win the Europa or not, he's got to go. 

The team's been shit for months and months *and months*, and he's done *nothing* to turn it around. He's not doing his job to get even half-decent results out of one of the most talented squads we've had at Everton in decades. That's a bad manager. We need a good manager. Every day we stick with Martinez is a day we are lumbered with man who is not up to the job.

EDIT: Oh, and to the people who keep saying ""we're not going to get relegated, calm down"", I have two points:

1. You don't know that we aren't going down. People have been saying all bloody season that it's not going to happen, but the team isn't getting any better, so what are you basing that on?
2. We might not get relegated, but this can still be a disastrous season. You think players like Lukaku, Mirallas, Stones, etc have a reason to stick with a club that finishes 14th-15th? They'll be off, and we'll have to start from fucking scratch and it could be a few years before we can even talk about qualifying for the Europa again.

If Roberto got sacked tomorrow and someone told me Big Dunc would take over until the end of the season before we make another appointment I actually can't think of a reason to be upset other than it being a shame because Martinez seems a decent bloke.

 

The important thing is though that he's a deluded cunt who I guarantee will come out after this match and say that the result wasn't a fair reflection on the flow of the match before proceeding to field another shit, unbalanced team in our next league game and feign bewilderment when we dominate possession but get picked off again because we can't penetrate an opposition defence for shit and its guaranteed our arse-wipe midfield and defence will gift them half a dozen chances to put the ball in our net.

 

Don't even know why I'm still getting wound up about it. I'm as stupid as our manager for doing the same thing (bothering to watch our matches) again and again while expecting a different result.

I'd rather hammer nails into my hands than watch **The Voice**, but the random science documentaries are generally worth staying up for.

The thing is, there's nothing to the voice. It's basically just celebrities and some sort of gimmick, but the random science docs actually take talent and effort to put together.

90% of people would rather watch the voice however, and if the BBC went to a subscription model, then ITV would just make *The Tone* or something similar and they would watch that instead.

Just a broad observation about bad priorities and the general tendency of people to apportion blame to others - especially government in respect of unpopular policies -  rather than hold oneself even partly accountable.

To expand on what I was saying, when you look at how pathetic some people's diets are at the best of times, even when finances and other circumstances permit proper meals, it's not unthinkable that even the smallest of cutbacks could take someone to the brink of malnutrition without their realising it. When that does happen, one shouldn't instinctively point the finger of blame at the government. It may be reasonable to sometimes, but not always. Personal negligence is at times the ultimate culprit but such is the political climate that it is next to impossible to question that without a great deal of blowback.

I know everyone's circumstances are different and undoubtedly people are screwed by the government every day. But here's the thing: every policy change impacts someone, somewhere, in ways that aren't immediately obvious and will never be investigated or reported. And that, if brought to the fore, would paint a grotesque picture indeed.

Hypothetically, who would know if a sudden commitment to a social welfare programme that on the face of it seemed to help the needy and gained widespread approval, while at the same time necessitating a small increase in taxation, might so disrupt someone's finances that the end result, directly or indirectly, is illness or suicide? Would you know about it? More importantly, would you care? And would that be grounds, as the comment to which I responded seemed to imply, for legal action to be taken against the government or even individual prosecutions?

Every action, good or bad, no matter how well or badly intentioned, however broadly or specifically targeted, can have upsides and downsides to people in ways that aren't immediately obvious.

Bentaleb was calm and composed, and this was a good performance from Mason.  We had the ball a lot and didn't rely on him to make to many ambitious, intricate passes.  His run for the goal was great, as was his finish.

Chadli was awesome, I don't think Kane was ff so he has two goals today in my mind in terms of rating his performance.  Townsend had a shaky first half, but was the perfect player to have on the pitch when we went up a goal.  His pace was perfect for the counter he scored from.

Eriksen was solid enough.  I think he struggled with how packed the center was.  Swansea clearly set out to try and neutralize him and Kane, and did a decent enough job at it.

Sub were smart from Poch I thought.  Mousa wasn't spectular but did well enough, Soldado was inches from scoring twice, and had some very nice interplay around the box.  Davies didn't have much time to do anything, but to be fair the goal was probably on him.

Ramires and Zouma pairing was absolutely atrocious. I don't  know why we still play Ramires (and this comes after his assist). And it's not because of the two missed chances. I was actually impressed that he got there and did something half threatening. He looks undisciplined and even lacks the work ethic that I believed was his only positive trait. Maybe it wasn't out of laziness and maybe he was just caught off positions, but we should not be playing Ramires if possible. And also I know we didn't have much of a choice playing Zouma out of his CB position but we need to figure something else out. He looked great against Tottenham but he looked so lost this game. I honestly believe that the only reason we had so much trouble against WHU was a large part due to this duo.   
  
Our defense looked tired. Only person who played to his normal level was Cahill. Ivanovic seemed out of position more than usual (or maybe it just looked it because the rest of the defense and our CDM couldn't cover for him).   
  
And we can't just ignore the poor poor finishing form our attackers. Costa should have had a sitter, Hazard should have had a sitter, and Ramires should have had at least one. Oscar was invisible for the most part and Fabregas loses the ball more than I like when he's hard pressed by the opposition.

Honestly, I never cared about Islam.  It was just one more religion to me, not any different from the others.  But, after 9-11.  After Salman Rushdie and Charlie Hebdo and ISIS and Rotherham and on and on we all have to start taking notice about what is going on and how we should react.  Because, like it or not, Islam has made itself the focus.

&gt;All across Western Europe the Muslim population is finding itself increasingly the target of some new law or restrictions every day

I can only speak for myself, but I've tended to be on the side of maximum freedom of speech and *mostly* on the side of freedom of religion.  (With some caveats as I don't think that the religious should receive any special protections.)

Let's be real though.  If many Muslims had their way, I would very quickly lose my freedom of speech and I could even be killed for my atheism.  Yes, many Muslims in Europe suffer racism and genuine victimization, but given any power, religious conservatives have shown over and over again that they would use it to create victims of their own, and for all their problems, Muslims still enjoy far greater religious freedom than they would living under an Islamic theocratic rule.  

So, what's to be done?  Again, speaking for myself - I'm not looking to deport anyone or to harass any Muslim or to harm their freedom of speech or their freedom of religion.  

However, I do think that Islam should be challenged - in the same way that we challenge *all* ideas and *all* ideologies.  It should be scrutinized and criticized and even mocked.  I want to see drawings posted of Mohammed and comics able to freely satirize the absurdities of the Muslim religion.  I want to see intellectuals tear apart the inconsistencies in the Koran and historians explain how Islam is just a human creation; an ideology of its time.

And, as I explain elsewhere on this page, I want to see European Muslims start to become more ready to criticize their own religion and take more responsibility for the problems it has caused.  I want them to stop being such hapless victims of circumstance and to wake up and join us in the modern world.

Pros

*  Nice to see Olivera out there and I thought he had handled the ball with more skill than Gomis usually does.

*  1st half our defense was stifling

Cons

*  Too much kick and chase for my liking, Tottenham seemed to win every ball out of the air
*  Our passes looked sloppy or Spurs just looked much quicker than we were getting to them.
*  Taylor had a bad one.
*  Rarely won 50/50 balls out of the air. Are we a shorter team compared to others?

I do understand your points, but I already provided a good example of non-government regulation of ""free"" speech in advertising somewhere else in this thread.

I think there should be a definition of what free-speech is as opposed to for-profit or commercial-speech. Anything with a financial hook attached should have financial consequences and enforced through the civil courts.

I also stated with regards to libel and slander - that I would scrap the laws but replace them with something different - limiting the power of these types of cases - perhaps regulating them to just a fine - and prevent libel tourism for which the UK is know worldwide (our borders to libel-migrants are wide-open!)

That just leaves free-speech that hurts peoples feelings. I really don't feel that people's feeling should be protected. I don't even think hate-speech should be banned or prevented - that means jokes on Twitter should not even get a raised eyebrow from the police.

Of course, if we are going to regulate people's speech then we should remove culpability for people who've been 'radicalised' and treat them more like mental patients than criminals. Maybe that's what needs to happen?

Of course, my greatest fear is that at some point they're going to invent a machine -not that reads your mind - but interprets electrical pulses in your mind - and governments like the UK will immediately want to purpose it to route out thought-terrorists - people with radical thoughts.....

null,false,AntiWanKenobi,crest,Bigger Than A Jags Deflection,null,"I'm still trying to get my head around that game, before I make points like that, but I have two things that I want to add.

Firstly, in confrontation to yours, how does a man set up a team to smash the shit out of Arsenal, Chelsea and Man United in their own grounds last season, but this season can't get past such footballing luminaries as Steve Bruce (twice) Mark Hughes (twice) and Nigel Pearson? (twice) By that, I mean there has to be a repeat of the early performances in the man and his team somewhere.

In advocation of your points, I've always thought Roberto and (Bear with me) Brendan Rodgers were fairly similar in managerial styles. In fact, I've always thought Martinez was a better manager than Rodgers 'pound for pound', but this season, (and I won't hear a word about how much they've spent respectively because it doesn't matter with this point) both teams have floundered and only one manager has actually changed things.

Yeah sure, Roberto's tucked that attacking midfielder back into a 4-3-3 in recent weeks but we're just as anaemic as we have been all season, whereas Brenny has come up with a bright, different 3-4-3 system with a box in midfield that has managers up and down the country guessing whilst they take something like 28 points from 30. Whilst Roberto gives us variants of 4 at the back, 5 in the middle and 1 up top and doesn't seem to have anything else up his sleeve so doesn't change a thing.

Lukaku is gassed and has the touch of a man with a north-north relationship between foot and ball, but he keeps playing him.

Naisy baby is as honest as can be and never stops running, but he hasn't been able to control so much as a television for about two months, but he still picks him, and there are barely a handful of players you couldn't get stuck into for being shite and at times overindulgent.

I don't know what I'm expecting (and I know I've gone on for far too long here as points keep coming to me so I'll wrap up) but if we were talking this time last year, I'd have expected Roberto Martinez to be able to come up with something.

If the party you support has no realistic chance of winning, you would have a choice between increasing the vote share for the party you like, or picking between one of the front runners in a 'lesser of two evils' situation. And if you feel that they're all the same and you don't trust a single one of them, there's bound to be an independent candidate running.

Everyone views themselves as the good guys. The best way to get a good picture on what's going on is to get information from all sides. Politicians will often misrepresent what they or their opponents have done to make themselves look good and their opponents look bad, so always be aware of the counter-arguments, backgrounds and context (if possible).

2. Not in my view, necessarily. I'll return to this at the end.

3. Loads. The problem is there's an obligation to play the game and the game is starting to overshadow the substance of what they do. Prime Ministers Questions (""PMQs"") is meant to be a way to hold the PM/state to account, but it's largely turned into a farce of the party in government trying to make itself look good and the party in opposition trying to make it look bad.

4. I don't know what you've thought about, or what you perceive as the biggest issues. Long-term it's probably anything that can kill us off, so climate change and nuclear weapons. Short-term it's potentially many things. Housing, the minimum wage or enforcement of it, tax avoidance, ISIS, Russia, funding the NHS, funding pensions, funding education, funding infrastructure...The importance of all these things is constantly fluctuating compared to the others.

5. N/A.

Onto voting...First past the post is what we have and it means if you vote for anyone other than the winner, you don't get represented. All you've achieved by voting is to help prop up the voting system that hasn't represented you.

Now, you may or may not have noticed that companies are far more receptive to customer complaints if it starts to affect their bottom-line. If they're still making money/getting paid, they have less reason to address criticism. I believe the same applies to voting. The more people vote, the less reason the powers-that-be (who benefit from first past the post) have to change the current system. If they get a 75% voter turnout, they can say ""why would we change to a proportional system, when 3 out of 4 people are clearly happy with what we have?"". If they get a 40% voter turnout, it damages the credibility of first past the post.

null,false,shabouwcaw,lfc99,,null,"Fantastic performance from Henderson. Great goal, great assist, tireless workrate. All round top class shift by the vice captain 9.


Coutinho was a bit more quiet than against Man City but again a great shift, good closing down. Found loads of space between the lines. 8


Lallana has flashes of quality, beginning to look settled and is constantly trying things. His first touch is incredible. Very good game from him, one of his better ones, was always turning into space. 8

Can's best position at the moment might actually be in defence. He seems to get more time on the ball and makes better decisions. Another tireless shift from him, his 18th in a row. incredible. 8

Skrtel always plays well if he can keep play out in front of him. flawless today. 8

Allen kept things ticking over nicely. was a little less fluid in his passing than he was in the City game, but I think he was closed down faster. Would have been in dreamland if his shot from distance had gone in 7

Sterling got some joy down the right in the second half, but was quiet overall. perhaps wasted in the RWB position, doesnt get him involved in play enough. Suffered late in the game by his constant shuffling around, didnt impose himself on the game much. Was tidy in defence though 7

Sturridge still looks unfit. His football brain is obviously still there, hence the great goal, but his movement looks slow and he seemed a yard or so off the pace of the game. Did well to lead the line on his own, but should be in the box more. If we're going to harangue Balotelli for not getting forward, Danny should be held to that standard too. 6


Lovren generally tidy, but is always one dumb mistake away from catastrophe. probably his best shift in a red shirt though, except for Southampton, the opening day off the season. 6


Moreno looks exhausted. Some great link up play down the side, but he's very leggy and needs a rest badly. 6

Migs. I don't know how to rate goalies reall. He didn't make any mistakes really? other than leave Skrtel hanging once, but nothing came of it. A-

Fantastic result, any 2-0 is a good shift. Very disciplined, only one spell where Burnley created anything and we weathered it well. Still not creating a whole lot inside the box, despite the much vaunted 2 no10 system. that might be a worry going forward, we might struggle against a team that stacked the penalty area and then had 2 sitting midfielders in front. So Chelsea basically. Though a MOTM performance from the Burnley goalie may have skewed my perception of things a tad.

It's interesting to see how the two no10 system operates though. It does seem quite dynamic. Burnley couldn't really cope with the fact that Lallana was heading for the outside and Coutinho the inside, when in possesion. We did seem to do a good job of moving their CBs around, especially leaving them have to step up between the lines to fill the gap behind midfield. Hendo's sublime assist was a great example of that. 

Not really a lot of criticism or things to say about the match, it was sublimely controlled and professional. Nice to see the hard press back, especially in extremis. Good for Sturridge to get on the scoresheet, he did seem to move around a bit more freely after his goal so maybe his lethargy is a mental issue. Hopefully he can get over his yips soon.

On to Blackburn now, hopefully Moreno gets a rest, but other than that it'd be nice to see the same team. Maybe with Sakho in, if he's fit.

I take back my welcome for Kranjcar back on Summer deadline day. He seems to be merely the ghost of a certain knee injury patient.

I vaguely recall saying somewhere that the squad might simply lack the overall quality to survive. I'm settling back on that point of view. If we can't take anything from these games - and frankly this deep into the season referring to poor luck is just wishful thinking - then the outlook isn't good for the run-in. The bench tonight was a loaded dice.

With Fer gone and Taarabt a write-off we're a one trick pony, scheduled to become a no-trick pony in the Summer. There's a chronic lack of any danger from the middle.

That we don't have even a mediocre level Premier League rightback cost us dearly tonight.

I'm resigned to relegation now. If we stay up, happy days, aren't I a doom and gloom prick? With or without Ramsey at the helm, the entire show needs to be reset and start from scratch. Re-sign Henry and build around him, Yun (if no-one comes in for him) and Phillips. Come up with one or two plans of attack and buy to spec.

I want Roberto gone along with some players. I want us to be good again. I want to be excited for games again. I want to say we can beat anyone or at least give it a really good attempt. I want us even in defeat to look the better team.

Although it is long, the point of the guide is to help you start thinking about how to pick what's best for you. You just pointed out a flaw in the guide, there's no 'Before You Start' introduction on how to use it. Basically you should start by figuring out what your skin concerns are (which you have) and then just focus on one step at a time. You should also only introduce things every two weeks or so to give you time to figure out what is working and if it's actually doing harm than good.

Start with your cleanser, and just read the cleanser part. Then once you're happy with your cleanser go down the list you made. The steps marked (Important) on the guide are the areas you want to look at, so then just look at those steps.

Set the head to head one up anyway, call it ""The Prime Minister Debates,"" with Dimbleby on standby, podiums and full picked appropriate audience (good spread of political outlook and geography). Cameron will be free to turn up till the last minute.

ITV film at X-Factor studios, Dimbleby chairs, Jon Snow and Paxman bring in the fact-checking and follow-up questions and Kay Burley runs the spin room.

null,false,comune,null,null,null,"Hear me on on this one but, have you been on an airplane? I'm sure you have and have you been in a car? As you're probably aware, it turns out that you're more likely to die in a car than in an aircraft. I think what you're doing, is looking at the previous accidents in nuclear energy (of which there are a handful) and to slightly forget about all the tragedies connected to fossil fuels. Think about all the oil spills that have occurred and that's just the extraction of the resource and then you have the power plants them selves, which create pollution etc.
 Regarding the plane/car analogy, whilst the potential for nuclear to go wrong is very real and dangerous, the fear of this has resulted in extremely stringent measures to be put in place, which is why it's extremely rare for an aircraft to crash. Take Fukushima for example, it took an earth quake and a tsunami to create that situation, a situation mind you, that isn't half as bad as Chernobyl. I think what needs to happen with nuclear, is the removal of the fear and to create a wider understanding of what it actually is. I'm no expert on the matter, none what so ever, but my take on it, is that nuclear is a decent power source, relatively cheap in terms of pollution and price that's just staring us in the face. 

In terms of your original question regarding accidents, if course this is going to happen. The creation of energy comes at a risk, indeed everything does that humans are involved in, the difference with nuclear however, is that multiple contingencies are in place. Take a look at France, they've been doing just fine with their nuclear reactors and I believe (cannot confirm) that they have had no major incidents.

It does increasingly seem like the SNP is going to achieve an unimaginable victory. They are making insane gains, while Labour is facing unprecedented disaster.

These polls show:

* The SNP behind in only 3 of the polled seats, and tied in one. Swings of 20-30% in all.

* The SNP ahead in the southwest, where 66% of voters rejected independence, and in Glasgow where Labour had 50+ point majorities. 

The casualty list:

* Danny Alexander, Liberal Democrat Secretary to the Treasury
* Douglas Alexander, Shadow Foreign Secretary and in charge of Labour's nationwide campaign
* Margaret Curran, Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland
* Anas Sarwar, former deputy leader of Scottish labour
* Charles Kennedy, popular former leader of the Lib Dems

Jim Murphy (The *leader* of Scottish Labour) clings on for dear life with a mere 1% lead. Scotland's one Conservative MP, David Mundell, is tied exactly with the SNP.

Midfield is probably our most solid section of the field, especially if Can comes into it.

Illaramendi would be a good option in midfield, Pjanic too but I'm not sure we actually need either of them, I think Can, Henderson, Allen, Lucas are all worthy of starting so maybe a young player like Ruben Neves of Porto or Youri Tielemans of Anderlecht.

I agree we need a fullback cover, particularly right sided and I think our number 1 target should be Danilo of Porto, but Arbeloa would also be a good option. On the left side I would target Baba Abdul Rahman of Augsburg as a backup to Moreno.

I think central defence again needs strengthening, particularly on the right side where Can is filling in and maybe a backup to Skrtel. Not really sure who we have been linked to but I would like to see Varane link up with his national team partner Sakho but that is unlikely.

Please do ask for and write down any diagnoses, don't just accept the treatment. Moisturisers can be for xerosis (simple dry skin without inflammation) or atopic eczema (underlying inflammation), similarly corticosteroids can be used for several conditions.

But regardless of simple dryness, dermatitis or rosacea, do review your diet and lifestyle choices.

If I'm not mistaken, you're saying that there are other ways in which speech is regulated like norms or commercial practices. This is totally sensible as the law (especially legislation) can be a rather blunt instrument, and in some cases it is best to leave it to other regulatory forces.

&gt; I think there should be a definition of what free-speech is....

The trouble, from a legal perspective, is that the law is all about definitions. Technical and logical definitions, so that it has that element of certainty. In an area like freedom of expression though, what you generally find is that providing perfectly clear definitions does not really work -- in fact, it tends to have an *even more* restrictive affect. The debate over what sort of speech acts should be restricted is ongoing, constant and highly political. It takes place at the social, economic and ultimately legal level so it defeats the purpose to have 'hard' definitions or to draw a thick 'absolute' line *in law*. This is why even the US doesn't have a truly absolutist definition of freedom of expression, it's just totally impossible and would actually stifle the debate. That said, there are some elements that are relatively clearly defined and used. 

I completely understand the concerns over 'hurt feelings' resulting in criminal sanction. The media does a very poor job of not sensationalising this area. At best, I can assure you that that is not the legal definition, while admitting that with regards threats and harassment over social media, the area is experiencing some teething issues. 

The challenge with social media is distinguishing between what is a legitimate threat (which everyone would say warrants police investigation at the very least) and what is merely a joke. With things like assaults, which can be committed by speech alone (no need to lay a finger on victim), it is never a defence to claim that you were just joking. What is being regulated isn't a particular arrangement of words, but rather its real, active effects out in the public sphere -- particularly with respect to the maintenance of order (i.e. prevent all out chaos). 

The logic is similar with regards to hate speech. What is being regulated is not the ideas or speech itself, but rather its propensity, in a given context, to lead to violence, physical harm, and/or a threat to the public order. Naturally, this doesn't translate very well into the social media sphere because the norms are changing and there is a bit more of a 'give and take.' Nevertheless, there are instances when it is fairly clear that even if done through the internet there must be a way to criminalise what could very well be a proper threat. It won't look good for the police if someone dies or is beaten following what looked like a joke but was actually a serious threat. So we're kinda still trying to get the balance right. There will always unfortunately be a bit of collateral damage as the society adjusts and the norms find an equilibrium in the legal realm. 

I'm quite familiar with forum shopping with regards to libel here as well. We're quite divorce friendly as well, apparently. One of the things you learn at law school is that this has some disadvantages, especially when it is too 'claimant friendly.' It tilts the scales unfairly in that direction which is bad for everyone. On the other hand, there are additional reasons why people chose to sue here. Things like they're more likely to get better representation, or a fairer trial. The rules are more 'mature' so to speak so can best cope with newer and more complex cases. It's the original common law system, so it has quite the pedigree when dealing with these sorts of issues and is widely respected as a consequence. This can be really good because it means this jurisdiction is often the first to experience and 'test' new cases from around the world. At the cutting age of something as seemingly archaic as the law if you can believe it!

&gt; Of course, if we are going to regulate people's speech then we should remove culpability for people who've been 'radicalised' and treat them more like mental patients than criminals. Maybe that's what needs to happen?

This I'll have to think about. Already what comes to mind though is the question of whether being a mental patient is really all that different from being a criminal. Both are locked up, but the loonies tend to be drugged up as well. An interesting point though. 

Same goes for the 1984-esque dystopia. Scary day indeed when the scientists discover something like that. Hopefully there'll be some kind of war against well ahead of the time it is forced on everyone. Then again the new regime will have an equally strong interest in implementing that sort of policy... In the meantime I think I'll join you and start stocking up on some tinfoil hats, just in case...

I'm not that sold on Vietto just because of his size.  Sure he can finish, but he will never offer that bigger body as a forward.

We saw in Barcelona against Bayern and other teams that have size advantage but same speed that the team with all small players and no height are forced to play one way and get ran through.  I'd rather look at Morata or Aleksandar Mitrovic if we buy a striker.

When these situations are not fantasy e.g. in violent or otherwise abusive relationships, the person being abused (man or woman) is no longer in control. My point was that everything changes when that vital element of control is lost, and even if someone enjoys violent fantasies that does not imply by any means that they would enjoy experiencing it in a situation where they are not in control.

With 50 shades of grey I really hope there is an understanding that the relationship would be abusive if it existed irl. Someone reading a book can choose to put it down any time, but someone being pressured by someone they feel they can't contradict to do things they don't want to do can't so easily escape that situation if it's their reality.

I don't know if the abuse etc. is described as BDSM and/or socially acceptable in the book, but if it is I'd see that as extremely irresponsible with potentially quite harmful effects.

&amp;nbsp;

To go back to your first comment,

&gt;What I find very interesting within society is the recent popularity of 50 shades... A book about objectification, physical and mental abuse of a woman... And most women love it.

An equivalent from stereotypically male parts of society would be ""military shooters like call of duty are about violence against and mass slaughter of men... And most men love it.""

I've had a couple hours to let it pass and am less irritated now, so if you say you want Moyes back, I would definitely disagree but can't disagree with the the sentiment of wanting to see someone else be given a shot to try and steer us back on track. I personally would rather not go backwards and rely on Moyes, as we know who we are with him at the helm, and while that typically equates to finishing somewhere between 5-8, I realize that's much better than being in a relegation scrap but I truly want someone who can take the club forward, not back to consistently finishing just outside of the champions league.

Things have been dire with Martinez for months now, but our bed seems made at this point as far as how we will finish the season. I truly still believe we can stave off relegation and believe we should give Martinez the Summer to try to put together a squad that can compete for the champions league. We're probably a least a couple years away from that, but I'm not ready to believe that last season was a fluke, I still think Martinez has it in him to be a great manager, he just needs time over the summer to re-assess our roster and our philosophy with the players going into next season. If we're still dire next year, then I think it's fair for us to talk about bringing in someone new.

Unfortunately, whilst the empty chair would be amusing and may add weight to the importance of the debate to the public, I suspect the broadcasters may not be able to allow it for a head-to-head as it's too likely to suggest bias if they knowingly go ahead. Perhaps they would still use the proposed time slots for minority debates instead.

However, the joint statement did say:

&gt; The party leaders will be formally invited to take part in these debates. In the event that any of the invited party leaders decline to participate, debates will take place with the party leaders who accept the invitation.

I don't understand why this response is coming from the conservatives now, when planning began in October and was supposedly agreed (after the Green party issue) in January. They also suggest the week of March 23rd, which is quite different to what was proposed.

Over the span of a few seasons, you'd expect a managers impact to show in the results and, as long as you applied proper context, you'd have a better idea what was down to the manager, and what was down to various other factors. The difference a manager makes is incredibly marginal in comparison to other factors; for instance, player quality, measured by overall wages, is almost perfectly correlated with a clubs performance over a reasonable period of time. The only managers to consistentlyover a given period overachieve relative to their squad quality are Moyes (pre united), Big Sam, and Mourinho. People massively overexaggerate the relative effect a manager has, and so to terminate a young, promising managers contract over such a small margin would be an awful decision.

null,false,potentialhijabi1,eng-yorkshire,God's own land,null,"&gt; Well, this is because the problem of how Islam can reconcile itself with the modern world has become one of the central issues of our times.

 Certainly where I lived, no one gave a toss until 5min ago about whatever you believed. Even now you can walk down the main streets in them town centre and see Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus and anyone else getting on with their lives quite normally. 

Also, Salman Rushdie and the whole Satanic Verses palaver was 26 years ago, and yet people seem to insist on dragging its corpse up time and time again with pretty much close to no understanding of it. 

Rotherham was as much a cultural as it was a religious issue- my understanding of that is that most of the men were at best nominal or 'two Eids' Muslims so any link to their religion is at best suspect. 

I'm not making excuses for any wrong Islam may have done, and I think in this respect you and I both can both agree that where there is wrongdoing, there needs to be action to correct it. However I feel that it is fast becoming the case that too many people are trying to make oversimplistic judgements about such incidents, trying to reduce complex social, cultural and geopolitical situations down to 'derp derp Islam' (partially because, and I'm guessing here, it would seem that for many, actual understanding of all the factors just isn't there). 

&gt;I can only speak for myself, but I've tended to be on the side of maximum freedom of speech and mostly on the side of freedom of religion. (With some caveats as I don't think that the religious should receive any special protections.)

I agree with you here, but as I've said before, it is also a two way street in that you cannot single out a single religion for restriction or legal challenge. This has been one of the things that really annoyed me in all the halal meat debates- kosher slaughter, even though it is pretty much identical to halal slaughter, got a free pass. Ditto the veiling issues, which rather than being a general issue of covering the face, was little better than Islamophobia wrapped up in a 'security' mask, with the same old myths being repeated time and time again. 

&gt;Let's be real though. If many Muslims had their way, I would very quickly lose my freedom of speech and I could even be killed for my atheism. Yes, many Muslims in Europe suffer racism and genuine victimization, but given any power, religious conservatives have shown over and over again that they would use it to create victims of their own, and for all their problems, Muslims still enjoy far greater religious freedom than they would living under an Islamic theocratic rule.

Even if this was the case, it still does not excuse what is happening right here and now in Europe, which isn't under theocratic rule and certainly not by Muslims. It is a simple case that two wrongs don't make a right. 

I know it will likely sound hackneyed to you, but I have often felt part of the problem within the UK is that Muslims as a whole are pushed out of society as a whole, which in turn pushes communities into themselves even when they truly feel British and want to be part of British societies. I have experienced this myself- putting on a hijab saw people who'd known me for years turn their backs on me completely, show open hostility towards me and generally treat me very poorly. And this is the experience of someone who's lived here for close to their entire lives, speaks fluent English and considers themselves British. 

&gt;So, what's to be done? Again, speaking for myself - I'm not looking to deport anyone or to harass any Muslim or to harm their freedom of speech or their freedom of religion.
 
 You may not want this, but there are those that do espouse such opinions 

Plus, there may be no need to deport anyone, or at least for me- I plan to leave this country for good anyway. 

&gt;However, I do think that Islam should be challenged - in the same way that we challenge all ideas and all ideologies. It should be scrutinized and criticized and even mocked. I want to see drawings posted of Mohammed and comics able to freely satirize the absurdities of the Muslim religion. I want to see intellectuals tear apart the inconsistencies in the Koran and historians explain how Islam is just a human creation; an ideology of its time.

I couldn't give a toss if anyone wants to do any of these things. But there is a difference the size of Belgrade between the sort of intellectual pursuit you describe and the sort of ignorant cracked record repetition of myths which passes for arguments that I've come across. 

 I must add as a final point regarding that last paragraph, I want that too. But what I do also want is for the Muslim community in this country to stop being treated like aliens, but fellow British citizens, and for trust and respect given by all people on all sides to everyone.

I had a motherboard from them a few years ago and it suddenly refused to POST.  No warning signs given, it just failed.  Not a problem usually, I just sent it back to Scan for repair or replacement.  For 4 weeks, the only correspondance I had from them was to acknowledge that they had received the board.  So, being annoyed, I checked their returns policy to see if they had a time limit on repairs.  I was happy to see that they did and that my repair was over the time limit, thus granting me a replacement.

So I spent some time on the website picking out a replacement at a very similar price and phoned Scan to inform them of my decision to replace the board.  They informed me that I would have to pay around £60.  I told them that the price of the new board was extremely similar to the old board and I would be happy to cover the difference, but it was nowhere near £60.  They replied that because I had used the board for 8 months, it had gone down in value.  They called it a wear and tear charge.  Naturally I refused and demanded to speak to a manager.  I was refused this as well.  The guy on the phone simply told me that ""this was their policy and I would just have to deal with it.""

Obviously, I phoned trading standards who were equally apathetic in my phone call to them, but they did at least confirm that what Scan were trying to do was illegal and gave me a reference number to pass on to Scan.  I did so via email as I didnt fancy speaking to the same person again.

It took 4 days for a response: ""We have replaced your motherboard, please come and collect it"".  I replied that I had sent the board in via courier and would like them to return the item in the same manner.  They again refused to do so and told me that if I wanted the board, I had to come and get it.  At this point I was completely sick of Scan and just wanted rid of them, so I decided to go and pick the board up instead.  Luckily I only live about 30 miles away so its not too much of a trek. 

The pickup was fairly pain free, but the guy behind the customer service desk was as arrogant and rude as the person Id been speaking to on the phone.  When I got home I searched the Scan website for the owners email, which was listed on the site with an ""If you are unhappy with our service for any reason, please contact me!"" disclaimer attached to it.  So I emailed him... yet never received a response.

Scan are lazy, rude and push the limits (and in my case, push *through* the limits) of what is acceptable under trading law.

I can't wrap my head around that. 

The robot talk is a bit silly. I'm not talking about removing the human *element* from the sport; I'm talking about removing human *error* on the part of the referee. I see no downside at all to that. Referee mistakes aren't good for any sport, no matter what, imo. Even when Liverpool benefit I wish it wouldn't have happened and that we won the game because we were better and deserved it. Shit calls spoil the win, to varying extents.

Also, if you're in a foundation year then if you pass it usually you're guaranteed entry into your degree, and can even transfer to different unis. But if you do the full a level in maths then you lose that guarantee as well as the lower offer into foundation years.

Rubbish.

It says, 'Palestinians who live in Israel believe that it is THEIR land which is being occupied by the Israelis.' This implies (if anything) that it is the Israelis who are to blame for occupying Palestinian territory.

Please note that the point of the question is to identify this statement and to justify why the Palestinians feel justified in their actions.

You could just as well make the case that this is biased against Israelis because it suggests they are illegal occupiers. People are going to see in this text exactly what their predetermined view tells them to see.

&gt;The picturesque Arlington Row cottages were built in 1380 as a monastic wool store. This was converted into a row of cottages for weavers in the seventeenth century.  The cloth produced there was sent to Arlington Mill. Arlington Row is a popular visitor attraction,  probably one of the most photographed Cotswold scenes, and was preserved by the [Royal College of Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Arts). It has been used as a film and television location — most notably for *[Stardust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_(2007_film\))* and *[Bridget Jones Diary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Jones%27s_Diary_(film\))*.

For a bit of the game Hazard was playing in the false 9 role and Costa was playing more of a CM. Our teams attack is a constant flow of interchangeable parts.

null,false,Number6UK,null,null,null,"As /u/benryves has said, it's really personal preference. The thing you need to ensure though is that you make the tea properly.

The exact *details*  of how a cup of tea is made can incite small-scale wars, but if making it by the cup from a teabag, my preferred way is:

1. Teabag goes in the empty cup.

2. Fresh water is boiled - if the water has already been boiled before, the resulting cup of tea never tastes right to me. I think this is something to do with oxygen in the water escaping during each boil, hence the fresh water each time. For the same reason, you don't want to leave the water boiling for too long either.

3. The water *has* to be allowed to boil for a few seconds, then within seconds of removing from the boil, poured onto the teabag. Warm water is no good. Hot water is no good. Scalding water is no good. It has to be literally just off the boil.

4. Give the teabag and water a good stir, remove the spoon, then leave the cup alone for about 3 minutes. This bit is tricky because too short a time and you'll get really weak tea, too long and it can get very bitter. How it turns out will depend on things like which brand of teabags you used, how hot the water was, what type of water you have (hard/soft).

5. Give it another quick sitr, then squeeze the teabag against the inside of the cup, then do whatever you do with food waste (i.e. bin or compost or whatever). (Late edit: Squeezing the teabag is something I do, but seems to be controversial - proceed at your own risk!)

6. Add whatever you like to add to tea, probably milk (start with about 1cm worth), maybe sugar. Some people like lemon.
It would probably be unwise to mix milk and lemon - I haven't actually tried it but I'd imagine you'd get a horrible curdled mess.
I usually prefer just milk as I find it makes the most refreshing cuppa.

Some people do step 6 between steps 2 &amp; 3, which is perfectly fine, however I find that the tea isn't strong enough when I do it like that.

Biscuits are optional, but note that they're not what Americans generally call biscuits (which I believe are something like our scones). Apparently the closest thing to our Digestive biscuits are Graham Crackers, but I have no idea whether they'll work properly with a cup of tea. If you're able to get other UK brands, then McVities Digestives are probably the ones to start with.

Also, I wouldn't recommend boiling the water in a microwave. It's easy to superheat (heat beyond boiling point without actually boiling) water in a microwave, meaning when the superheated water is disturbed in any way, it violently boils in one go, showering everything and everyone nearby in boiling water and steam. It doesn't happen a lot with tap water due to minerals and things dissolved in the water but it does happen.

Since the US electricity supply isn't really geared up for electric kettles, the best way is probably to boil the water in a stove-top kettle.

I'm sorry, I've really, really rambled on - your question wasn't even how to make a cuppa, just which brand of tea, but I've written it all out now so I might as well leave it here.

null,false,2econdclasscitizen,null,null,null,"Okay. A lender can make a mortgage offer with a different rate of interest to the 'headline' rate it is advertising at a given time, or the rate the customer has applied for. So if your mother applied for a certain rate, she wasn't guaranteed to get it, and the lender didn't have to offer a rate similar to the one that had just ended. 

However, I don't think it would be right for a lender to make a mortgage offer with one rate and then put the customer on a different, higher rate after the offer is accepted. If it wanted to change the terms after making the offer, I would expect it to explain itself clearly (with correspondence covered in warnings or perhaps a phone call), and it really shouldn't be doing this after the borrower's acceptance of the terms has been confirmed and the payment amounts agreed. 

If the rate your mother was given is higher than the rate she accepted, she might want to make a complaint. Factors like the reasons for the change and how it was communicated to her might be relevant, but I think she would have an arguable case. Take the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service if you think the lender isn't being fair.

null,false,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,null,"before ""New Tory"" I would have agreed with you, however these days I find it harder and harder to see the difference. I think the corruption of power similarly taints both the red and blue more than their ""differing"" ideology separates them.  
I see Labour very much as In The Thick of It portrays them, lost due to their poor enlistment where they desire whip respect over ability so you're left with a pack of mindless oafs chasing votes while the core of the party that controls the whip obviously still has a vague idea what's going on but that's lost as well within this sea of oafs.  
This is partly where I prefer the candidates of the smaller parties (why I state that Lib Dem is more about the poor than Labour) as they're usually less whip respectful as to win a seat they need do a lot more than turn up with a certain coloured rosette which actually makes them more politicians than patsies. So when legislation is tabled they actually have a fucking thinking cap on and ensure there are protections and exceptions for the poor.  
Labour are just more inclined to do something mindless _towards_ the poor (e.g. throw a massive dollop of money at welfare) irrespective of whether or not its effective (e.g. consultant fees in attempts at NHS reform or the whole target based systems they threw in). So I think Labour are just as likely to fuck everyone these days as the Tories.

He has some rough edges to deal with, such as bad clearing and wrong passes, but his positioning and marking were right, which means the defensive gaps he used to create (stated many times by Carra) have finally vanished.

And the Charlie Hebdo attacks were several weeks ago.  But the Rushdie incident *is* worth remembering.  One of the UK's best writers sent into hiding for writing about Islam and people dying for the cause of free speech.  That's a wake up call.

&gt;putting on a hijab saw people who'd known me for years turn their backs on me completely, show open hostility towards me and generally treat me very poorly. 

Isn't that what you want though?  Wearing the hijab is sending a clear message that you *want* to be seen as different from mainstream society.  It's the same as when kids dressed as goths or punks.  And you also get to complain that people don't understand you and play the victim.  

&gt; But what I do also want is for the Muslim community in this country to stop being treated like aliens, but fellow British citizens, and for trust and respect given by all people on all sides to everyone.

But you *are* aliens as Islam is not a British or European ideology.  

If you want to become part of the club then you will need to do what other groups have successfully done and embrace secularist and Enlightenment principles.  Also, and this is just a suggestion, try getting some of your lot to cut it out with the beheadings, the turning of British towns into rape camps and the gunning down of harmless cartoonists.

As a bit of background, I'm a recruitment consultant and sift through about 30-50 CV's a day.

Profile:

""consistently achieves goal"" should be ""goals"" /
""a extremely fast""  should be ""an extremely fast"". 

Comments on profile:

Your profile doesn't really have direction. It should be two sentences (three at most) that says: this is what I am, this is what I've done. This is what I want. 

If you're targeting your job search to a specific job, then say that... ""ideally seeking a challenging career as a health and safety enforcer, where my efficient problem solving and excellent organisation skills will be rewarded with opportunities for progression."" 

Your profile has too many buzz words in it. I switched off after a couple of them. Avoid clichéd terms like ""wealth of experience"" and ""highly motivated"". When I see an original phrase on a CV I want to praise hallelujah to the mountains. If you have one or two introductory sentence(s) and keep it to less than 5 buzz words/phrases, it won't be that bad.

Talking about your experience in the ambulance strikes is not needed. It should be listed with your experience, under things you did in the armed forces. 

Key skills:

Do me a favour and take all of your individual skills and categorise them into ""communication"", ""organisation"", ""problem solving"", ""language (list your native language as native)"", and whatever else you deem appropriate. 

Bullet point them under each header.

Take the ""experience in an ambulance"" role out, put it under your armed forces experience. You've spent the past 7 or so years there and have not listed anything beneath it. It looks like you haven't learned anything there.

""a genuine desire to care and help..."" isn't a skill, it's more of a personality trait. If you want to include it, fit it into your profile.

""can be counted on to work for extended periods..."" is also known as resilience, tenacity and motivation. ""recognised and relied upon for my extraordinary resilience, motivation and tenacity.""

""planed"" should be ""planned"" 

I'm in work now, but I think you get the gist of where I'm going with it. The only things I'd say are that you need to list your achievements and experience under your armed forces part. Also, remove 'excellent health' from the info bit. Its assumed you're in good health because you're still in the armed forces and you're applying for jobs.

null,false,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,null,"This is such a naive view of the rental market.

Rent is not set at the cost of the mortgage to the landlord, but at the price the market will bear. Do you think a landlord who has paid off their mortgage charges no rent? Of course not.

This is why landlords calculate yield, as the annual average rental income divided by the value of the investment. If a house is worth £100,000 and it brings in £5,000 a year rental income, that's 5% gross yield. (some landlords will also factor in the increase in equity as well though that income is unrealised until you sell)

Financing costs, maintainence, legal, staff (e.g. if you need cleaners or agents), and tax come after gross yield, they're expenses. Good businesses manage their expenses to stay in net profit. 

What you are suggesting is when a business goes into financial difficulty because they can't manage the expenses, that they just increase their selling prices.

The reality is as soon as you do that, nobody buys and you go out of business even sooner. Prices should always be set at the profit-maximising level (determined by market and direct-cost analysis) and expenses / indirect costs (e.g. incurred regardless if the property is rented out or not like mortgage) should be managed.

If that is *too difficult for the landlord to do*, then they are not a competent business-person and should sell up, take the equity, put it in a retirement fund and go back to working for someone else who knows what they're doing.",null,0,null,1425544023,null,0,false,0,cp505gk,null,t3_2xwrld,null,t1_cp505gk,null,t1_cp47m5o,null,null,null,1427590081,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

All the parts are readily available from RC hobby suppliers - motors, speed controllers, radio gear, propellers. There's even open-source flight controller software which can run on an Arduino using the guts of a Wii MotionPlus as sensors. You can't really limit people's ability to buy (or import) that sort of stuff.

Another issue with regulation is that it could put [&lt;15g toys](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hubsan-45mm-11-5g-H111-Copter/dp/B00GZV99U0) and small &lt;500g [hobbyist mini-quads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70pusNNunMA) - generally flown at low altitudes/short range - under the same regulation as much larger and potentially more dangerous drones.  Micro-sized toys are fairly harmless unless they hit someone directly in the eye, perhaps - and they don't have the range to be a threat to aircraft.  5"" plastic propellers can cause nasty scratches/small cuts. Big carbon fibre props on rather more powerful motors - as you'd find on higher-end aerial photography setups, well, they'd do rather more serious damage if they hit somebody.

The real problem is people who have done absolutely no research into quadcopters or RC flying in general going out and buying a ready-to-fly 'big kids toy' - usually a DJI Phantom, the most popular ready-to-fly model - and flying it [somewhere stupid with minimal skill/experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlhbmvTNqf4).

If you actually spend a bit of time reading/learning before buying/building a quadcopter, you're likely to see plenty of hobbyists calling out examples of reckless flying, and have a pretty good idea of how+where to fly safely and responsibly.

What I think is important is that if/when relegation is confirmed, any player that isn't in long term plans is put aside (Austin excepted).

In all due likelihood the SNP would prop them up whilst demanding big concessions. Giving in would probably kill the Labour party (which is already facing a major crisis with the rise of the SNP) but not giving in would lead to a crisis.  
  
As for the fixed-term act, this provides for new elections in the event of a vote in no-confidence. Basically, the government has to lose a majority vote in the commons on the motion ""this house has no confidence in her majesty's government"" - whereupon parliament would have a set few days to pass emergency legislation (like budgets) and outstanding business then be dissolved and an election called.   
  
Worth noting: loss of support from the SNP is what brought about the collapse of the last minority govt in 1979. The result was 18 years of Tory rule.

But I think you missed the subtly of my point, an un-controlled deflation in UK house prices, could be quite the pickle, to put it mildly.  Not just because the government has agreed directly to co-underwrite many mortgages, but because of the wider aspect of confidence.

One of the biggest problems, and I remember watching this unfold from a cash rich, great credit rated hedge fund desk, was a collapse in inter-bank confidence.  Cross correlated risk was not taking into account on the trade level, at the legal entity (one bank is not just one legal entity) level few could actually tell someone their total exposure to say LB.  This is why CVA and stuff came in.  But wait, there is more, say you've longed a bond, but you are of course responsible to your investors, so you have a CDS protection on it.  What happens if your issuer goes bust?  Your risk portfolio sees the hedged trade, and has appropriate metrics against it, but suddenly you might find yourself in trouble, in completely unrelated asset classes.  If leveraged, you might find yourself in going bust trouble, thus creating more problems and so forth.  This is why many simply decided to not trade, certain markets dried up, others became a short fest.  There was a complete lack of 'credit' one might say, it wasn't just hard, it was [NP-Hard.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem)",null,0,null,1425549445,null,0,false,0,cp51brj,null,t3_2xwrld,null,t1_cp51brj,null,t1_cp50dhe,null,null,null,1427590630,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

It might have been the brightest spark in a tinderbox.

However, it's very important to remember that the US had a different kind of mortgage issue, that was, those which prayed on people who couldn't do basic maths, I remember reading an internal report written by a german employed analyst who was trying to pull data on IQ and home owner loan kinds.  One big issue was the rewards that were given to salesmen, not even bankers, just people who sold mortgages.  It didn't matter if the person defaulted, there was a real estate boom, prices were going up, so the issuer would not loose out, with housing supply increasing above population in many cases, I can't recall the exact figures, as this was back in 2006, but suffice to say many people saw this issue coming.

Again correlated risk didn't factor into many peoples models.  The logic was too simple.  There are 100 mortgages issued in 'AniTown', odds are, only 2% default.  So we can cover that fine right?  That's only going to be 2 houses?  Nope, 'AniIndustries' is the only employer in the state run dystopia that is the United Democratic Peoples Republic &amp; Kingdom of AniLand.  And this employer closed down due to a small chemical explosion.  All the mortgages will default.  The risk is not separate, each mortgage issued is not a fair dice roll.

The USA had been weaned on the *Greenspan puts* this was a glut of cash, anyone could borrow easily, few defaulted, so it was fine, business and commerce was used to this.  It was the lenders withdrawing from making that cash available, which resulted in the US economy taking a nose dive, many firms profits were driven on growth and expansion that had little margin against a long term historic average of borrow costs.  So it contracted.

So yes, house prices in the US where a big factor, the market there is incredibly different, the need for us to demonstrate, not just affordability, but also APR and the like reduces the risk of having idiots (NINJAs) been sold mortgages.

If we had a swift reduction in house prices, it would hurt many people who think it would benefit them.  Unless they are a cash buyer, many banks wouldn't even lend at 50% until things had 'stabilised'.  Renters would potentially suffer too, as few would be in the landlord game, because the risk of the underlying asset is to great (Schiller writes some good arguments for property indices in his book *The sub prime solution*).  Many people don't appear to realise this, the same people who think that more BTL landlords is a bad thing fail to acknowledge the first order effect of driving down rental yields (even if there is a second order effect of the rising asset).  What we need is a nice controlled deflation, preferably some kind of target for councils and the like to keep them in line with median income (via granting planning permissions).",null,0,null,1425551182,null,0,false,0,cp51lrv,null,t3_2xwrld,null,t1_cp51lrv,null,t1_cp51elh,null,null,null,1427590759,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Any of the sit down Indian or Asian restaurants will have a good veggie range. Archana (Dublin Rd) and Lolita (Stranmillis) are personal favourite Indians. Zen is a lovely East Asian near City Hall but perhaps a bit pricey depending on what you're looking for.

This means now you have to choose between only a handful of 2 striker formations, or not playing to your best striker's full potential. 


We have a world class spine, but not quite the world class team such as the likes of Real, Barca, or Bayern. While I agree with you that our squad is not quite on that level yet, it seems to me that sometimes Pellegrini is forced to squeeze too many 'big names' into the attack of a system which requires tactical discipline. Silva and Nasri are both brilliant playmakers but are not really suited to playing wide in the 4-4-2. They are great at unlocking a smaller playing defensively where we dominate possession, but in the bigger games when you couple this with occasional defensive absence of Yaya it's easy to see how we get overrun and you see our CBs diving in to tackles they shouldn't have to make. If you were picking players based on suitability of the system then Milner and Navas actually suit the role better, but our 'big players' have to feature in the big games. 

It's definitely a conundrum for Pellegrini and it wouldn't surprise me if we do eventually move on one of our 'big name' players in favour of someone to suit the system.

Cheap fans will make a loud(er) motor whine, will produce more turbulent air (louder ""whoosh"" sound) and they won't have anti-vibration mounts, so transmit a buzz through the case.

The price you want to pay is a tradeoff between these sorts of things - if you REALLY want a quiet system and are willing to pay for it, Noctua fans tend to be the best regarded, though they're way above what I'd pay at around £20 each. If you don't care about noise, then go ahead and buy the bargain bucket ones. Personally I go for the mid-range ones (any decent brand really), about £8 each for 140mm.

Then there's the whole airflow vs pressure thing - for an unobstructed case, you want maximum airflow obviously. However if there are restrictions such as filters, heatsinks, grilles etc you might want pressure optimised fans - these don't give out as much overall airflow, but the closer-packed blades help keep airflow up under obstruction.

Then of course there are server fans - these give out ridiculously huge airflow for their size, but absolutely SCREAM whilst doing it.

You will become a member of the college MCR (Middle Common Room, there'll be a JCR for undergraduates and an SCR for faculty) and this can become your social/sporting centre, as well as your 'work' centre at the faculty. So many science positions come without attachment to a college and these can leave people a little isolated. If in the future you are able to pursue your career at Oxford, your college connection can help.

Accommodation is a potential issue: private housing, especially near the centre of town, is expensive; so grab any and all opportunity to use College-owned accommodation. If you get the opportunity to live in the College itself for any time at all, I guarantee that it will be the most memorable time of your life.

Merton College fronts onto a cobbled street and backs onto Christ Church Meadow, a magical and historical place where some of the greatest minds have enjoyed the views. It's also famous for its food. Your work place will be in the Science area which is a 10 minute walk or 3-5 minute death-defying cycle ride away. Don't expect to be able to keep a car at Oxford unless you're willing to pay about £15 a day to keep it parked.

Yes the rich lobby for things that benefit them. So do other groups.. that's what lobbying is for. If your complaint is that rich people have more power to lobby due to their money, then fine.. that's something you can fight against.

null,false,smoshuap0wers,1972crest,,null,"Agree with you on Reus, he should be a priority (as I believe Pogba is unrealistic due to asking price) and he's a sort of unconventional striker- similar to Jovetic. You have to consider wages too, mind. These 40m+ 'world class' players will demand 150-200k a week, if not more, especially with increasing tv money. Add that to your fee and our FFP wage limit and surely you can see why we haven't been able to get them in. Players like Fernando were cheaper and demand less weekly, he's filling a gap until we have a solid youth player or alternative on the market.

I also agree our left midfield is weak BUT only because we don't play a conventional 4-4-2, it's a 4-2-2-2 hybrid. Occasionally Navas and Milner come on to add width and make the formation more standard, but usually we're playing centrally. That's the way we play which means we don't need a left midfielder of world class quality- our focus is on the middle of the pitch, we have very good players to come on and change the dynamic when required.

Our midfield will probably stay the same, swapping Lampard for Rony. No idea what will happen with Jovetic (I think Jovetic will be sold and will go for considerably less than we paid but hopefully not to an english team) as the 4th striker really should be a promising youth product or a player who can reliably fill-in, but we have no one of realistic standard currently.


You make selling players like Sinclair, Clichy and the likes sound easy; where did you get those prices from...FIFA15? Suggesting selling Mangala after dropping 32m(more like 44m+) on him is ridiculous too! Nobody in their right mind would have spent that money on him to begin with, never mind 22m after the varied performances he's had so far.

You have to remember the kind of wages we've got these players on. They're well within their right to remain on the same so that effects what clubs will pay for them. That said, Sinclair won't go for more than two million and Clichy will most likely leave on a free when his contract is out. If anything, Kolarov is most likely to go back to Italy in the summer and we'll purchase a young left back. Other than that I see little transfer business going out.

Maybe this season is a write off, but when we all saw Chelski doing the business did we honestly think we could retain the title? I didn't.

It would have been great if we could do all the things you mentioned but in truth it wasn't realistic. We're in transition again, from being bang average to winning the league, to being forced to operate more holistically.

&gt; it is never a defence to claim that you were just joking.

In strictly terms of free-speech, this is where I think we differ. I think it is a perfect defence to say you were joking - humour is the lubricant that keeps our conversations going.

I would make a distinction between a one-off joke however and harassment.

But here is a fine line... guys in the workplace bringing up an old joke frequently as part of a comradely is very different from a neighbour repeatedly calling you names and relying on the ""joke"" defence.

Relationships need to be taken into context when harassment claims are made.

The truth is, broad definitions in law that turn regular activities into criminal ones, do not mean those activities are now actively policed... rather it means that every now and then someone who thought the activity was fair and legal gets caught.

The law in this case is akin to a bear fishing out salmon from the river - I don't think that makes good law as people who attempt to follow it would find themselves having no end of social and conversational difficulties on the most basic level.

Tell me, have you ever watched Sliders, there is a rather interesting episode where they end up in a parallel America where lawyering has gone havoc and you have to sign a legal contract just to order and eat a fast food burger.

I get paid enough a month to afford a modest flat, eat and live a comfortable life. But I don't have enough to put away any money. Essentially I won't be entering a point in my life where I would be able to afford kids both in time and money until I'm at least 25. 

Then there are people I went to school with who dropped out at 16, had their first child at 17, got a council house, had their second child, and are now pregnant with their third. They worked a part time job when they were 16 but left after they had their kid.  

On the one hand, no. I wouldn't swap my life for theirs; I love what I do and I want to have a better life for myself and my family than what the benefit system can afford. But on the other, when I do have a kid I'm not going to be able to spend as much time with them. I won't see every important moment, get to watch every episode of This Morning, and my most important concern won't be what to eat for dinner that evening. Equally, when I want a second child I'll have to wait until I can afford one - my income will (hopefully...) be at a point where I'm leaking most of it to tax.

I think the current set up fosters a lifestyle of freedom from thought. People can simply get pregnant and know they're going to receive £X to cover that cost. They don't have to worry about how they're going to plan to send their kid to university, or pay for day trips for the whole family. When they're sitting with a family 6 children deep those sorts of things get harder and harder, and their kids will suffer as a result.

Perhaps a child-limit isn't the answer. But at least it might make the more irresponsible people that are gaming the system stop and think a bit before creating another life. The particular person I mentioned is an extreme example, but if such a limit was put in place and she wanted a 4th child, perhaps she'd go out and get a job and become a contributing member of society even in the smallest sense.

&gt; So are the debates dead?

&gt;Well, maybe not. But only if the broadcasters hold their nerve.

&gt;In other words if they decide to press ahead with the three debates and empty chair the prime minister.

&gt;It would be a huge decision - and many at Westminster remain sceptical that the BBC would be willing to do this.

&gt;However, privately, the broadcasters' insist they will not buckle and will not allow one party to ""dictate"" the conditions.

&gt;They insist the single 90 minute seven, or even eight party, debate proposed by the prime minister will ""not cover the ground"".

&gt;And crucially, both Labour and the Liberal Democrats say they will still turn up for whatever debates the broadcasters' decide to hold.

&gt;Ed Miliband will even take part in the head-to-head without David Cameron - and subject himself to a grilling from Jeremy Paxman.

&gt;Senior Lib Dems say Nick Clegg would be ready to stand in for the prime minister in the final head-to-head, making it a Miliband v Clegg clash.

&gt;The danger for the prime minister is that even if the debates lose their impact without him - he risks a backlash from voters for failing to take part.

&gt;Downing Street's hope is that the broadcasters will buckle and either agree to his proposal or just scrap the whole idea of TV debates for this election.

null,false,Calchitcho,null,null,null,"&gt; Raising kids in care is significantly more expensive than child benefit. Is thIs policy supposed to be about saving money, or just punishing poor kids? 

Discouraging the mechanisms that lead to cyclical poverty can be done in a number of ways.  Principally, we try through education to increase the opportunities these kids have.  Perhaps, however, it is time to also start tackling the root of the problem, and disincentivising those on benefits from having children.  

For me, the £300m that this policy may or may not save is irrelevant- compared to the total budget, that is chump change.  Rather, it's about the almost immeasurable benefit (socially, culturally and economically) that might be gained in the long term if less kids are born into families who live their lives on benefits.
