Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Pogba as a player and prospect and De Bruyne's stats were insane but Sterling will bring a quality to attack that has been missing for a long time.

 We have needed a winger who looks to take on defenders and make things happen on his own for a long time. The weakest two positions last season were the opposite wing from Silva and in Central Mid. I would argue that the wing has been a weak point in the team for a few years now. Navas helped bring a new dimension but once he was figured out to be somewhat of a one trick pony he was largely nullified. Sterling brings a dynamism do the wing that will open things up for everything else in attack. I don't think that is something we would get from De Bruyne or really anyone other than a dynamic winger. 

Last season teams decided that they could pack 3 people around Aguero and let us kick it around until a counter opened, and it worked. Buying someone to pass it to Aguero(De Bruyne) isn't the solution to that problem. Sterling is going to constantly try to take on his man, and is going to beat him enough that it will draw defenders away from Aguero to account for him. I wouldn't be surprised if this alone is worth 5+ goals. His impact will be seen far beyond the stat sheet.

Of course, he would have to have a 20/20 goal/assist Ronaldinho 2005-esque season for Liverpool fans and people on /r/soccer to claim he was worth the £44m fee which they seem to think was £49m upfront.

* Benteke will flop massively

* Firmino won't be able to adapt quickly

* Sturridge never fit for the season

* Henderson under performed

* Milner is 6/10 not the usual 7/10

* Brendan rodgers kept playing lovren instead of sakho

* Brendan rodgers are not fired after finishing outside of top 4 again

* We'll finish 6th



**What my Brains tell me:**

* Benteke will do OK, will score about 15 goals not 20 (which is disappointing for 32.5 mil, but kinda ok)

* Ings and Origi will get around 5 goals each (sub in app and cups)

* Henderson will have a better season than last season but not as good as 2 years ago.

* Lallana will come good and will be fit for the majority of the season

* Milner will be the solid and consistent 7/10 with occasional 8/10

* Moreno will improve

* Rodgers playing skrtel and sakho

* Gomez got cup games alongside lovren/toure

* Sturridge will play atleast 18 games next season

* Ibe will be good for us, but not as good as sterling 2 season before

* We will finish 5th just outside of top 4 (by 2~5 point difference)

* Reach quarter final league cup, semi in FA cup, and quarter final in Europa league



**optimist view**

* Benteke will be good and score 20 goals next season

* Lallana will score 15 goals next season

* Henderson will have double digit goals and assist next season

* Ibe will be as good as sterling 2 season ago

* Ings and origi get 8 goals next season

* Milner is a solid 7/10 and with 10 8/10 games will get almost double digit assist (play huge role next season)

* Sakho and skrtel to have 10 goals between them

* Finish 5th, 1 point outside top 4

* Semi league cup, semi in fa cup, win europa league

&gt;Even though Quebec voted to reject independence twice, in both 1980 and 1995, a toxic mix of “neverendum” uncertainty coupled with the business-unfriendly policies of Quebec’s secessionist government achieved what even the Great Depression could not. Partly due to the lack of any long-term certainty about constitutional arrangements, slowly but surely, Quebec’s financial institutions all decamped. Royal Bank of Canada, Sun Life Financial and a host of other big names left for Toronto, where now even the Bank of Montreal has moved the majority of its operations.

Here is mine:
GK: nothing, Bogdan and Mignolet is enough. Mig has just married, his wife is the best GK coach now.
CB:I don't think we will sign new CB. Simple that Lovren is still given chance.  Skrten and Sakho is first prior. Kolo still be here. If Ilori not out for loan, we have 5 CBs. 

My think that we have 4 CBs as 2 teams, 1 young CB for backup or we can call from U21 and let Ilori loan out.

RB we have Clyne, Flanagan and maybe Wisdom. IMO, Wisdom is not suit for RB, maybe CB is better.  However Can can play as RB, so I think RB is ok now.

LB we have two Spanish guys and Gomez. I think Enrique will come back to Spain. Atletico will be good new team, I heard that Siquera will move to Inter? If Enrique move out, maybe we will sign a veteran LB.

CM: we have Can, Lucas, Hendo, Milner, Allen. Unless Lucas leave, we will not sign any one. Milner replace G8, that's all. First team: Hendo, Milner. Second: Allen, Lucas. Can has to make another breakthough to go as a CM. Lucas will go down for Can.

AMC/LM/RM/LFW/RFW: Countinho, Ibe, Markovic, Lallana, Firmino. We just sign Firmino, Ibe will be young back-up. Done.

FW: Ings, Sturrrigde, Origi, Benteke. Lambert, borini and Balo will left. All 4 FW can play in flank, Firmino can play FW. I think Origi probably loan out again will recall condition. Maybe BR keep him cuz injure prone of Stu and Benteke.

FSG doesn't have habit to sign much in winter window, unless first year of BR. So there are no fund for it, unless someone leaves.

A few additions:
Oliva is on the Witte de With street which has a lot of bars and good restaurants. Best burgers in town, and probably outside of it can be eaten at Hamburg and Ter Marsch. Lots of good beers at Reijngoud. For Feyenoord cafes check out the Bijerlandse Laan on the south side. Since Koeman and Pelle went to the Saints it's almost everyone's favorite English team so you'll probably have a great time. 

I personally never had a problem with aggressive people here, although normally around 5 am we'd go to Stadhuisplein (were the Skihut is) to watch drunks fight...

We used to have a great time at the Bed on the Coolsingel but haven't been there for some time. We have newly opened Annabel and around the corner is Bar. At the back of Anabel is Biergarten. All these are a five minute walk from central station. Which is worth a visit on it's own.

LB: Enrique moves, no pingpong team anymore. Gomez is keep as back-up. Flanagan has chance here.

CM: Milner and Hendo. third choice is Allen. Not sure about his beard. Lucas will leave in winter since Can prove himself as CM.

AM: Countinho, Firmino and Lallana

FW: Benteke. Not believe in Sturridge.

* Joe Allen fades into nothingness and is consumed by the beard. The result is a new creature known only as ""Jed"". Jed has double digit assists.

* Coutinho learns actual magic tricks for pre-game entertainment.
* Brendao grows a mustache.
* Ibe hits the post at least 4 times
* Markovic comes into his own on the flank and becomes a force to be reckoned with.

* An image of Sturridge popped up immediately followed by an 8-Ball saying to ask again later.
* Boring James Milner becomes Smiling James Milner
* The formation is majorly changed 3 times.
*  Emre Can does not fill the CDM role yet, but shows progress towards that goal.
* Henderson casts off all curses of being ""Unlacky"" and has a TOTY season
* The season ends with us taking 3rd by 2 points due to an own goal in the last match by Kompany.

null,false,Thekingofthedukes,null,null,null,"I recently read a book about the numbers in football. It stated that over the long term teams will always regress to the mean. surprisingly, it stated that extra ordinary is followed by a regression to the average and that the poor is then followed by progression. So we should see our side improve this year.

The average in football is the wage bill, a team should usually finish relative to their wage bill. So according to our average we should expect to finish 5th long term based solely on wages. I still think United will be the ones we fight it out with for 4th. It will come down to us being able to score goals again this season. The heart says we will get that 4th spot, but the head says that we will miss out again this year.

The other interesting assertion was that managers are sacked too quickly in football following a set of bad results, but in terms of a season a team will come through a bad patch and pick up form regardless of a change in manager.  So from that perspective it will be interesting to see what sticking with Rodgers proves. 

I feel that we will start the season well, although will still struggle upfront while the new players are settling in. Possibly playing well and still ending up on the wrong end of results due to the tough away fixtures this season.

I think Lovren will show the form we bought him for this season. Assuming he wasn't just having a good season before we bought him.  Although, I fear he will never reproduce what he did at Southampton and be sold in January.

Clyne will perform well this season and the defence will be much more solid. I'm thinking this due to him coming from Southampton and the comparisons in our play. Having said that the three last season failed to really get going. It could just have been down to bad luck with lallana being injured in preseason and lambert being bought for the bench. 

I'm thinking our new signings will need time to settle at the club and we won't see our best form until after Christmas again. 

The stand out performer this season will be Henderson. He has improved a lot over the last two seasons and without Gerrard in the squad he will grow into the captains armband this season. 

We will get out of the group stage in the Europa, but will get knocked out in the quarter finals. With two semi finals in domestic competition last year, we will go one better this year and end up winning one of the cups (a man can dream). Probably the league cup on penalties after a nervy 120 minutes.

null,false,bruce_mcmango,null,null,null,"But you see none of those things will be affected *whatsoever* by consultants doing routine work on weekends. Perhaps it would help if I explained what doctors and specifically consultants do for their job. There is a difference between being 'on-call' where you are admitting the new patients and responsible for the sick ones and a consultants routine work. Routine work includes ward rounds (varying in frequency depending on specialty), outpatient clinics, academic work, teaching, admin time. There is always across every ward and every department every second of every minute of every hour of every day of every week, month, year etc somebody who at the very least is 'on call' if a patient were to need to be seen by a doctor, all the way up to consultant level. 

Consultants work weekends on call and when they do, they don't get any time off later in the week to compensate. They work 12 consecutive days. 

To address your points specifically:

1. Discharges - On my ward &gt;75% of my patients are fit to be discharged. Why are they not going home? It has nothing to do with wether a consultant has their admin session on a Sunday. It is because we do not have enough carers in the community. Routine working on the weekend will do nothing to change this.

2. Continue treatment - I'm not sure exactly what you mean by this. If somebody needs treatment - antibiotics, diuretics, whatever - that still happens on a weekend! 

3. Get an appointment for a specialist - Yes, if consultants ran their outpatient clinics on weekends, you'd be more likely to see someone on a Saturday but without an increasing (and paying for) a corresponding increase in doctors, all you do is remove from running those same clinics on the weekday. The overall availability does *not* increase.

4. Speed up medical procedure - Hahahaha. Sorry. But no. If your patient is waiting for an endoscopy, for example, your consultant doing her academic work on a Sunday will *not* make that more likely to happen. Emergency services are already in place out of hours, *for emergencies*. If you think having consultant GI surgeons doing endoscopy lists on weekends would help you get a procedure quicker, see point 3.

5 Improve use of physical resources - The reason this won't happen is that a consultant does not run a theatre alone. You need theatre nurses, technicians, cleaners, porters, IT people for when the computers cock up, pathologists, biochemists, secretaries/admin staff to process the paperwork you generate and many, many, *many* more people. Without expanding ALL of these, you cannot safely expand the use of the physical resources. 

I'm not sure what your background is, but it worries me because your post is exactly the sort of nonsense that I think Jeremy Hunt is trying to mislead people into thinking. 

Do I think that we need better staffing on nights/weekends? As a doctor who has worked all sorts of weekends, I more or less do think that actually. And still, Jeremy Hunts posturing about forcing consultants to do *routine* work on weekends has *nothing* in it whatsoever that will achieve this in any meaningful way. 

Oh, and I would recommend you read the report about patient mortality on weekends before quoting it. You'll find that it says a patient admitted on Friday is likely to be more sick than the patient admitted on Monday and that it doesn't think the staffing levels account for it.

infinite monkey cage is brilliant, definitely a more economical use of one's time than jre. i made the mistake of starting from ep1 with IMC, when i too should really have worked backwards, i've still got a lot of them to catch up on.

so these are some of my fave jre's but general consensus of his hardcore fans might disagree with me:

i'm a sam harris fan, so his now multiple appearances, i've always enjoyed.

shane smith eps (guy who owns vice) are good.

all the dr. rhonda patrick eps, probably my favourites.

the katy bowman ep, i was really intrigued by.

the cenk uygur ep (young turks news founder).

multiple bill burr eps, pretty funny.

graham hancock eps, who is a bit of a kook, but interesting one nonetheless.

the russell peters eps.

Secondly, if you had to get cocaine within three hours, what would you do? The course of action for almost everyone who thinks about this is to ask a friend who smokes weed for their dealers number, see if they sell harder, and if not, that dealer will probably know hard dealers. If you and none of your friends knew weed dealers, that network of access to harder drugs would be cut off, and you'd have to use something like Craigslist, which is much riskier and would put a lot of people off.

In ten years half of these people won't even remember who Ed Miliband is, just like few people now remember IDS or Michel Howard as Tory leader.

Labour will, I suspect, do a little better at the next election than at the previous one (just as, actually, they did a little better in England at this election than they did in the previous one). It won't be enough to get them into power in all likelihood, but I'd be surprised if there wasn't a Labour government in 2025.

As the saying goes, oppositions don't win elections, governments lose them.

Was Tony Blair an excellent politician? Sure - just as Thatcher before him, he won a lot of people over who otherwise wouldn't have shifted. But his victory was mostly down to the collapse of the Tories after Black Friday and the confusion and muddiness of the last couple of years of Major's government. I don't doubt that even someone like Foot could have scraped a majority in 97.

There was this thinking before the election that Labour could somehow walk into office after only five years, but we had a sitting government who had presided over an economic recovery. Let's not pretend shock that the incumbency effect is strong.

Maybe labour will get in next time - we'll have to wait and see how badly things go for the Tories. If they manage to keep things more or less ticking along, expect that random hand of fate to intervene by 2025 if only due to the odds of *something* going wrong by then.",null,0,null,1437291712,null,0,false,0,ct8gpg3,null,t3_3drsfl,null,t1_ct8gpg3,null,t3_3drsfl,null,null,null,1437988458,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

&gt;""Labour may never win back its former supporters who jumped ship to the Conservatives on 7 May and robbed it of any chance of victory, according to the most detailed investigation into why people deserted the party at the election.""

Labour's vote *increased* on the 7th of May, and it *increased more than the Conservative's vote*. Labour did lose votes to the SNP in Scotland, but gained more in the rest of the UK. Perhaps there are people who did jump from Labour to Tory, but they're more than offset by other vote switches. Perhaps there's a more useful story about Labour losing votes to the Tories, but it likely refers back to 2010 or earlier.

The real story of the 7th of May election is what happened to the Liberals - they were utterly trashed everywhere, and while their vote may have dispersed in a bunch of directions, because their constituencies were largely rural Liberal/Tory seats, the Tories hoovered up more of their seats than anyone else. Labour also lost a huge pile of seats to the SNP in Scotland, and both of these were exacerbated by the problems of the first-past-the-post system.

Concentrating on people moving from Labour to Tory is a pretty futile exercise, since that was a marginal cause of the 7th May election result, at best.

It does involve entire organization changing how it works. Isn't that what the BMA are saying?

I a short answer, no. But now I understand your background, I understand why you were wrong and it disheartens me because I think most non-medical people could easily be forgiven for thinking like yourself. Surely removing inefficiencies/bottlenecks and moving about resources would fix things, right?

The thing you have to appreciate is that healthcare in the UK is an *enormous* ecosystem. Hospitals are actually a relatively small part of the puzzle. We also have a primary care system on the verge of implosion (GPs retiring or leaving the UK left, right and centre + nobody wanting to train to be a GP), a public health system that is increasing pressure on primary care by insisting on lower thresholds for investigation referral (therefore MANY false postives), an ageing, increasingly frail + demented population who need care in the community which doesn't exist because A. The councils can't afford to employ them and B. Nobody wants to be a carer because it's such hard, poorly paid work (did you know they don't get paid for their time travelling between clients). 

And it is all interconnected. The reason you cannot remove the biggest bottleneck in hospital (delayed discharges awaiting packages of care or nursing homes) is that they simply do not exist for the reasons detailed above. And let's imagine for a moment they did exist and the 20 patients on my ward who could go home tomorrow, went home tomorrow. I'm not going to pretend that I, as a single doctor on  a ward working with a registrar and consultant, *could* manage patients to the standards I want if the blockages were removed. I know that, my consultant knows that, the hospital managers know that. So would removing the bottleneck lead to a better use of resources - well standards of care may actually *decrease*. It's perverse, I know. 

If you were to ask me to choose one thing to improve the productivity of the entire health system and hospitals in particular, I would say that you need to invest in care in the community. The people who feed, dress and wipe the bottoms of the patients too frail to do it themselves who inevitably end up in hospital because they're more likely to become unwell and because hospitals are still the safety net where these people go (and stay/linger) when they can't safely be at home.",null,0,null,1437292999,null,0,false,0,ct8h1i7,null,t3_3dqa4f,null,t1_ct8h1i7,null,t1_ct8gp2i,null,null,null,1437988663,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

The fundamental difference being that the SNP, Greens and UKIP weren't major forces back then. People just bounced back and forth between Labour and Tory, going to Lib Dems if they wanted to object to two-party politics.

If people continue to be willing to vote for smaller parties, Labour's loss may be permanent. Labour's problem is that it's a huge coalition of rather diverse political views brought together by opposition to the Tories. That means no matter what line they take, they will always leave some groups unhappy.

Did you miss an /s from that? Strong house prices are not an indicator of a strong economy. The UK mess is a result of government policy creating artificial shortages and easy credit allowing anybody to fog up the mirror to borrow money.

&gt;If food and fuel prices shot away from inflation and wages like house prices have, there would be rioting and civil unrest as we'd be on something daft like £5 for a pint of milk. However, house prices going through the same motions are considered a success story.

I know what you mean. If you remember the 2005 election Labour's poster said record house prices! As if it was a good thing.

The problem is if you haven't noticed is that the UK government (of any colour) relies on house prices rising in order to garner votes. Back in 2001/2005 it made the home owners feel wealthier with unearned wealth. Also second mortgages against homes (MEW) increased consumer spending by 9bn per month. I remember seeing this idiocy at my work place. Michelle she was a secretary earning just over min wage.

This obsession with regaining lost votes is costing the party dearly and is providing candidates devoid of a sense of direction as they are relying on what the media tells them matters to make their policies. Populist leaders are pointless.

I dislike the approach that states Labour should be a government in waiting. It is a nice ideal on paper but it only makes things worse when you have the party attempting to preempt the Tories in the media, just to force their hand. Demanding apologies for things people don't really care about for example, on the off chance that they can generate some opposition. 

I think Labour is going to struggle no matter what option they take ultimately as long as they are not taking a stand for their beliefs.

null,false,Arlyd88,null,null,null,"Edit: I wrote too much - To summarise: If you transfer your entire existing ISA into a new one, yes you can still pay into it as long as you have allowance left.

If you only transfer part of the ISA and leave the current ISA open... I'm not sure why you'd want to do that unles you're moving it into a Fixed Rate... However I'm not sure (sorry). My original message: 

Hey! I'm really sorry but I can't just give you a yes or no answer!

I'm slightly confused because you said ""my Current (Last Year's) ISA"" but the ISA works from the UK tax year. That is 6th April - 5th April. This means Current Tax Year started 6th April 2015, not last year so if your ISA is current it should be this tax year too. If you haven't put any money in it since the 5th of April 2015 then it's old. :)

Am I right in thinking you opened this account LAST tax year (April'14-April'15) and then also put additional money in it after 5th April 2015? If so:

You can transfer this ISA to a new one and continue paying, however you need to check the bank you're moving to will accept a current year's ISA in a transfer.  I think it's pretty common that they do because they want your money however I did used to work for a bank who would NOT accept a current year's ISA, I'm assuming because they just wanted ISAs which were untouched so it's stable money for the bank) and perhaps they couldn't be bothered to take note of how much money you had left on your allowance... Also, dealing with current-year's ISAs meant customers would more likely to make a mistake and HMRC more likely to get involved.

The other thing is that a lot of banks will transfer current year's ISAs but require you to open an ISA with them first to put the money into... Make sure you don't have to open that account with money! For example, if you have your current ISA and then you open a new one with Natwest, if Natwest make you put in £1 to open it, suddenly you have 2 ISAs for the same tax-year even if you're transferring one across into it tomorrow! HMRC might start sending you letters and then you have to call them up, wait 2 hours on hold to get through to an advisor... Just check first and save yourself the hassle!

If you have opened an ISA last tax year, put money in it this tax year and then decided you were going to move SOME of it to another bank, I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure which would then count as the ""Current ISA""  as I never did with current year's ISAs at my bank... Why would you want to do this though? The only reason I could think of is if you want to put some of the old money into a Fixed Rate Account but wanted to  keep the rest of the ISA in Easy Access so you can keep contributing...

If you're looking to transfer some of the money into an Easy Access account you might as well just move the entire thing to the new provider... 

I personally think that if you transfer some of a current year's ISA to a new provider and then decided to keep some where it is, the old one will most likely stay the current one. But I am not sure and would recommend checking. It might not even be an option.

As I'm a complete stranger, I want to link you this: http://www.halifax.co.uk/isas/isas-explained/common-enquiries/
And point to the question which starts ""If I’ve saved part of this year’s ISA allowance with another provider...."" so you can see I'm not making this up. :) 

Finally - I guess it depends how money orientated you are... I don't have any ISAs and whilst I probably should (incase the interest rates go up, then I've lost years worth of interest), bare in mind that on an ISA with £5k and a rate around 1% you're looking at £20 to £30 a year. I spent £20 last night on a Dominos pizza. I could've had that money if I just went to Tesco and bought a £1 instead...

What I'm saying is, don't make it more hassle than it's worth. Yeah you're making the best out of your ISA but when you actually calculate how much interest you can earn over a year, it's still pretty low.",null,0,null,1437297889,null,0,false,0,ct8i603,null,t3_3drgi3,null,t1_ct8i603,null,t1_ct8h9fl,null,null,null,1437989500,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

Let's face it, there's been a massive campaign over the past decade or so, trying to persuade people to pick up their dogshit. And astoundingly, it worked. Somehow, people have been persuaded to stoop down and pick up dogshit and carry it around with them. If you'd have asked me in the 80s whether it was possible to persuade anyone to do that, I'd have laughed. But there you have it - some advertising agency have actually managed to persuade people to pick up dogshit.

Yet, now it seems to be dying out again. And the reason it seems to me is that the advertising money has dried up. It isn't natural to pick up dogshit, no-one likes doing it, and if they aren't being constantly reminded about it, they won't do it.

The attitude of the Great British public under nudge politics is apparently to do what they're told briefly, then slip back to their natural state when the nudging stops. And it's only really possible to nudge one or two things at a time. Now we're being taught to hate foreigners and the poor, there isn't really enough mental space to teach us dogshit management as well.

Most of the content on the iPlayer is put up after broadcast, so falls out of this mandate.

Interestingly, in the last 2-3 years they've started putting up live transmissions too, with a warning at the start that pleads 

&gt; ""Don't forget, to watch TV online as it's being broadcast, you still need to be covered by a TV Licence.""

I think in the future this will change though, the recent deal with the government to make the BBC cover the cost of the license fee for over 75s was agreed in return for allowing the BBC to start requiring people to have a license/pay a charge for using the iPlayer[1], which I assume would mean a change in the legal wording of the charter.

null,false,AimHere,null,null,null,"&gt;The direct swing between Labour and the Conservatives is of paramount importance if Labour want to win. 

But this wasn't about 'the swing' in general, it was specifically about actual factual Labour voters who actually switched to the Tories in May, which didn't happen to any measurable degree, and any voters who did switch that way were offset by other voters taking their place.

&gt;Also, you can't say it was a ""marginal cause"" of the election result at all. The only reason the Tories won a majority as opposed to the 280 odd seats they were predicted from the opinion polls was because the polls forecast a swing to Labour, whilst in reality there was basically no movement

The only reason the polls were wrong about the Conservatives switching to Labour is because the polls were wrong and Conservatives didn't switch to Labour. Gotcha. 

Of course, that doesn't explain the election result in the slightest.  Saying that 'Tory voters didn't switch to Labour and there was almost no change in the swing' doesn't explain in the slightest why the Tories won an absolute majority where they didn't have one before. Whereas saying 'Labour lost a disproportionate number of seats in a concentrated geographical area, and Liberal seats were disproportionately Liberal/Tory marginals, and therefore went Tory due to first past the post' does. My explanation has first step an explanation needs, which is it explains the observed facts. Yours doesn't.

And that's all irrelevant. To reiterate, the article is about actual Labour voters who actually switched. Not potential Labour voters who never became actual Labour voters. Not what opinion polls think about anything. And insofar as there was such a switch, it was clearly offset by other voting switches that made up for it.

There's a power exchange that happens. But they don't want an apology.

Section 67 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 makes it a criminal offence to record a person doing a ""private act"" for one's own sexual gratification.  Section 68 clarifies that using a lavatory is a ""private act"" if the person is in a place which would ""reasonably be expected to provide privacy"" - e.g. a bathroom with the door closed.

Now, granted, the offence is only complete if you record someone with the intent of looking at the images later for your own sexual gratification.  But if you found a camera pointed at your toilet and the person who put it there said ""oh no, it wasn't for my sexual gratification!"", would you believe them?  Case law makes it clear that intent can be inferred from action.  I would certainly believe that someone filming me using the toilet without my knowledge was doing it for their jollies... okay, maybe not if they were filming me, but certainly my girlfriend.

The same goes for your own bedroom - if you're having sex in it, and the other person doesn't know they're being recorded, you commit an offence by recording them, since they have a reasonable expectation that you won't be such a pervert.

Carroll is actually pretty good with his feet himself, some of the goals he got in his Newcastle days show that. The comparison with Benteke is a fair one and he'll arrive for only 2.5 million less than Carroll it seems, straight after we sold another player for 50m too.

My only real concern about the North East is that if I do go for it, if it all goes wrong, coming back to the South East is difficult if not impossible... I mean from a house-price standpoint. Such as if I move up to Leeds/Halifax/Sheffield sort of area, if after 3 years I'm not a fan, South East house prices increase a lot faster than the North, so I would be priced out easily in that time.

The concern is born out from a few people I know who did that exact thing. Wanted to come back and struggled.

However, people like my Dad absolutely loathe it, whenever I return home he's constantly fuming about having to pay the license fee when he also pays for Sky. His news source comes primarily from Sky News and his radio is always tuned to one of the commercial channels (SmoothFM?), his favourite programmes are the ones on Sky One about border control at airports, or road traffic police, or ones about immigration at Calais 

He probably does watch some BBC content, but I don't think he really holds that much of an affinity for the brand, as far as he's concerned the BBC are just a few of the channels in the 200 or so he gets by subscribing to Sky.

Mignolet will drop in one of the first games, but still be the reason we win that game in the end. He will end the season being in contention for the best goalkeeper, but not getting votes. 

Sakho will NOT miss any considerable time to injuries. It doesnt guarantee he plays better, but he will be a lot more consistent, and show that he is a top BPL centreback when he avoid injuries.

By November, Coutinho and Firmino will have multiple In-Forms on FIFA 16 Ultimate team. Both will get into a UT team of the year at the end of the season.

r/Soccer will be ready to march on the EA headquarters because Henderson will NOT be in TOTY, the word scandal will feature 200+ times in the thread and Hendo will gain 20.000 followers on twitter with the hashtag JusticeForHendo. EA will budge to the pressure, giving Hendo a Hero card. During its presentation, they will compare it to the stats on Steven Gerrards FIFA 10 card. 

Jordon Ibe and Lazar Markovic will both have very good perfomances as bench players, and provide something very different than our starting ""wingers"" Coutinho and Firmino. People will actually call for us to sub out Coutinho/Firmino as a result, just to see Ibe/Lazar on the pitch.

Daniel Sturridge will become our leading goal scorer, but his return will be later than people think. He will score a hattrick against Norwich.  

**Some dark ones:**

Benteke will miss more games with injuries than he will score goals. Danny Ings will be loaned out at the January transfer window. 

Lallana will start off very strong, without things clicking perfectly. By the time Studge comes back, Lallana will look marvelous for a couple of games, like he finally found his Southhampton form and more, before he is out for the season after a dirty tackle.

Liverpools defense will be improved, but still bad due to personal mistakes. It will look shaky, even when not conceding. 

Emre Can will NOT play as big a role in this years campaign as people think. Lucas will get considerably more time on the pitch, without impressing more than usual. Lucas won't find his pre-injury CDM form. 

Clyne will start of weak. Moreno will start of strong and be a complete terror to opposing teams defenses, leading to Gomez playing RB over Clyne for a while. By Christmas, Clyne will however be spoken of as one of the best RBs in the league, surprisingly not because of his offensive skill, which will stay as it is, but because he will lock down Hazard, Sanchez and Sterling without breaking a sweat. 

Raheem Sterling will score the winner at Anfield. He'll celebrate like a twat, and will get in trouble for his post match celebration out with the lads. The trouble might be with the police and he will say something stupid about it.  

Liverpool will finish outside the top 4, but we'll be around until late April. 

Manchester United will eliminate us from the CO Cup in the semi final, on a bullshit penalty that won't actually go over the line but still gets approved as a goal, in the 89th minute without a previous shot on target. 

We will be knocked out from the FA Cup by a team lower than the Championship, and it will be very well deserved.

We will play very well in the Europa League, perform absolutely dominating against every team in what will be the group of death and include Borrusia Dortmund. We'll get eliminated in the first knockout game by a team who was looked upon as the joke team in knockout stage. 

Brendan Rodgers will finish the season, but Jurgen Klopp will be announced as the new manager within a week of us finishing the last game. Media will break that Liverpool already have a deal with Klopp, the day after we're officially eliminated from the top 4 race.

null,false,Patch86UK,,Labour Member,null,"&gt;Firstly, labour didn't promise railway renationalisation, they promised to allow the state to compete against private ones when the franchises ended. If they had promised it outright, I would have supported them over the SNP. 

Labour's plan meant that franchises would be nationalised where it made sense to do so. Do you really want rail to be nationalised even when a privatised company actually can do it better? I think that in the vast majority of cases nationalisation would win out, but if there are a few niche cases where a private firm really can do it better/cheaper/more efficiently, who am I to stand in their way? It's nationalisation on merit, rather than on knee-jerk ideology. In my opinion, that should be Labour's approach to nationalisation all over.

&gt;scrapping trident

Less than 25% of the general population want that. And I reckon I know why Scotland has such a different opinion on this policy, and it has nothing to do with left/right- it'll be because the nuclear base is in Scotland. Do you think the people of Scotland would be so wildly out of kilter with the rest of the country if the base were on the Isle of Wight?

&gt;a serious push towards getting rid of fossil fuels

Really? This would be the SNP of ""Independence will be easy because of the North Sea oil money"" fame? I've just checked the SNP 2015 manifesto, and it has not a lot on the Environment. ""Carbon reduction targets""- Labour had harsher targets. Labour wanted zero carbon electricity by 2030. SNP only promised an 80% reduction by 2050. The SNP manifesto calls out windfarms as good, but advocates a ban on nuclear (which is a zero-carbon energy source). Labour's manifesto makes the same soft claims on renewables, but also allows nuclear (a good thing, in my opinion). I fail to see the difference between the two on this front.

&gt;free proscriptions ... and no tuition fees

I'll give you those two. But Labour were advocating a vast reduction in tuition fees (for England and Wales- for Scotland, the matter has nothing to do with Westminster and the General Election). And while universally free prescriptions certainly is a good thing, I'm not 100% convinced it's the best use of NHS funds- I'd much rather it be means test, with the wealthy paying their way.

Sometimes there are positive or negative externalities e.g. An inoculation has a wider value to society that could not be measured by the price an individual was willing to pay. A shoe made in a factory which pollutes a river and destroys the productivity of 5 farms downstream has a negative value which is not reflected in its price.  The BBC may have an educational value to society, or as a cultural export which raises the profile of the country allowing more exports or tourism. You would not expect any of that to be reflected in the price people were willing to pay for a subscription.

They did so by selling assets such as gold reserves which between '99 and '02 equated to selling off HALF of our foreign currency reserves. This also included billions in real estate and infrastructure.

The other method they used was to manipulate the books by shifting liabilities off balance sheet to hide their expense such as PFI initiatives. In fact PFI has left the government liable for up to 300 billion (which is brilliant because they only bought us 50 billion in infrastructure had the government just built it themselves). PFI's were basically a very high interest loan that wasn't technically a loan. Brilliant for hiding expenditure, utter shite for value for money.

Even funnier than that, new accounting rules were implemented in the EU since Labour left power which means these liabilities can't be hidden anymore and have to be counted as debt (I don't think the EU and EZ want to let countries like Greece cook the books again).

The profession is essentially being asked to stretch itself over 7 days when we're struggling over 5 - with no actual indication where all of these extra doctors are going to magically appear from - overseas doctors are preferring to goto other countries over the UK, given the hostile immigration and working climate.  I've looked at the medical rota for the coming year at the hospital where I am - there are over 1/3 vacancies on the medical junior staff rota - just even for the weekday stuff - there is no way that we're going to be able to provide services at the same intensity over 7 days.  Shortages that are already apparent this year - I've had to cover 2 medical wards alone during normal working hours as the only junior doctor during one of my rotations this year (~40-50 patients) and it's just not a maintainable way to work.

I think you've also misidentified the bottleneck.  For many of the patient who should be going home - it is usually not within the hospital - and if there is even a sniff of a discharge - it is possible to move heaven and earth to get people out of there.  As others have pointed out, trying to get people home at weekends is a nightmare as the support and social services staff just aren't there as the services are just not funded - not because there is lack of senior oversight or lack of will to discharge.

**Definitely need to get rid**

* Borini - he's had loads of chances, he's not good enough.

**Would be nice to get rid**

* Balotelli - I personally think he's had enough chances, although I know some people think that maybe he can improve in his second season with us. I doubt it.

* Enrique - too many injuries and just not good enough positionally. One on one, he's a beast, and he offers something going forward. But ... too many injuries! (And I think a high salary, too).

**Sad to see go, but probably needs to**

* Lambert - made up for him that he got his chance to play for us, and score a few nice goals, but I don't see him getting in ahead of Benteke, Sturridge, Ings. If Borini and Balotelli both go, and Origi is woeful to ~~being~~ begin with, then there's a case for keeping him I guess.

**No rush, but they're probably going at some stage**

* Luis Alberto - A nice ball-player, but not quite mobile enough or robust enough. Shame. He's on loan for the season, so if he performs well we might get a few quid for him, but I don't see him ever getting back into our team.

* Tiago Illori - Thought this lad has shown promise, and I also thought that Brendan had said he would get his chance in pre-season, but then he made no mention of his name when asked if he was happy with his centre-halves (he listed Sakho, Skrtel, Kolo, Lovren and Gomez).

Whilst permanently being in a state of offended and complaining about people expressing their opinions.

I mostly see it in here or other subreddits when I randomly come across your posts, we generally don't see eye to eye on most things.

What are your views on illegal immigration and those recently trying to break through the channel tunnel?

&gt;I'll admit I spend a lot of time combating racism online, but I'd like to think you'd agree with me that that's not a left wing issue.


I don't really bother with it, you're not going to change anyones opinion with it and it's just a waste of energy apart from patting yourself on the back for doing the right thing, morally.

&gt;We're not 2 dimensional characters. There are some elements of my personality that may not be immediately obvious through of other parts of my personality. I don't really think it's fair to imply I'm a fraud. 

Nah I don't think you are, I know you're into football and beer and all that but I also think you're probably growing up on us too much. Give it another 5 years or so and you'll be a proper boring grownup who reads the guardian and has egg whites and kale for breakfast,  with some fair trade orange juide.

&gt;And I don't see how being ""one of the lads"" and siding with the left on some issues is really contradictory in anyway? How is that related?

I'm not saying it is. You just seem to remind me of a lad I went to school with who divvies up his social media time in an 80/20 split of commenting on pro palestine/anti israel facebook pages and then the rest instagramming his lattes at coffee houses.

&gt;I don't think the criticism itself is the issue. That in itself is a product of free expression.

Well that is true, but it's to me the dangerous kind (sort of ironic, coming from me)

I agree that there's a balance between the concious ambition to allow equal opportunity and the embedded silent prejudice that characterized decades of our society.

The point is that the alternative to these active attempts to shape policy is that we get subtle and unacknowledged ways to do it.

Next, if you look at our squad who drops out for a DM, we have guaranteed starters in the back 4, hendo, milner, Coutinho, Striker(Benteke), and then to get the most out of coutinho we're gonna need more than just 1 striker in front of him, so that adds an AM(Firmino).

Hendo and Milner combined can do a good enough job as make shift DM, they might not be the best but it's better for our squad imo, and also the key thing here is not want you want or what you think is best, but what you think Rodgers is gonna do, and you know he'd rather play an extra AM than a DM. To go back to the original point of Vice captain, who replaces Hendo when he's out? It has to be Can and not Lucas, because Can can do what Hendo does better than Lucas.

a) Gold was sold in order to support the financial sector which had too much of its assets tied up in gold assets, and was in effect a soft bailout to prevent a crash

b) PFI was a Tory initiative in the Major government. the Reason Brown and Blair adopted it because of the SAME politcal calculation that people are making now about Labour needing to build credibility. They were a handy way of being able to bring in private sector funding into major infrastructure projects without having to raise large tax revenues over short term.

c) Labour had convinced itself that raising taxes was a bad idea due to the 1992 election loss and thus had to create instruments like PFI/PPP in order to satisfy the chronic need for infrastructure spending without losing the political battle on taxation. Without it Blair couldn't not sign election posters promising no new taxation.  

d) Very few saw the crash coming because as far the economics consensus was concerned the era of short cycle inflation and bust was over.

""He's not a comedian""... who the fuck are you to tell him what he can/can't say? I am *extremely* appreciative of when a speaker throws in a joke to spice and lighten things up a little bit. But this pleasantry I adore will be lost -- literally taken from us -- by attitudes like this. That it's ""not appropriate"" or ""insensitive""; no, that's *your* problem, that *you* need to fix. The world shouldn't have to bend down for you and contort itself to fit inside your tiny world view.

null,false,jimmy17,null,null,null,"&gt;a) Gold was sold in order to support the financial sector which had too much of its assets tied up in gold assets, and was in effect a soft bailout to prevent a crash

True. But it was expenditure. Just expenditure off balance sheet like I said. You can't claim that Labour didn't spend much money and ignore the selling of vast amounts of state assets, even if they were part of an early bailout.

&gt;b) PFI was a Tory initiative in the Major government. the Reason Brown and Blair adopted it because of the SAME politcal calculation that people are making now about Labour needing to build credibility. They were a handy way of being able to bring in private sector funding into major infrastructure projects without having to raise large tax revenues over short term.

Yes it was. And funnily enough it was heavily criticised by labour at the time for being A. backdoor privatisation and B. Hiding expenditure. The thing is, the use of PFIs was very limited under the Tories whereas under Labour (in spite of their criticism in opposition) their use was dramatically expanded until the majority of public infrastructure work from Schools, Hospitals, Rail etc was done by PFI. Saying that the Tories invented it doesn't change the fact that Labour ran with it massivly and hid almost a THIRD OF A TRILLION in liabilities off balance sheet.

In fact all you seem to have done here is provide a motive, not disprove that it was happening.

&gt;c) Labour had convinced itself that raising taxes was a bad idea due to the 1992 election loss and thus had to create instruments like PFI/PPP in order to satisfy the chronic need for infrastructure spending without losing the political battle on taxation. Without it Blair couldn't not sign election posters promising no new taxation.

I'm not sure what you've been trying to say here. You've basically just reiterated what I've been saying. Labour wanted to spend a load of money but just didn't want to put it on the balance sheet.

&gt;d) Very few saw the crash coming because as far the economics consensus was concerned the era of short cycle inflation and bust was over. Greenspan in the US, the ECB and the BoE were all running monetary policy to control high inlfation and thus prvent high interest rates. Everyone thought they'd learnt from the volatile 1980s and were keeping a steady ship. People expected a recession in 2006/2007 but the subsequent sub=prime crash being linked to major asset bubbles and CDC markets collapsing was not something policy makers could really cope with. If they tell you otherwise, they're lying.

You've got to be joking. People saw it coming years off and were trying to offset the problem as quietly as they could. This includes the gold sell off as a quiet way to recapitalise the banks. In fact a part of the problem with the toxic debts was that the banks realised they had fucked up so were packaging the bad debts into complicated financial products and bonds and were palming them off on each other. It was a big game of pass the parcel but no one actually wanted the ""prize"". I remember people going back as far as 2004 saying this was coming.


TLDR: Nothing you have said changes the fact that Brown and the Labour party spent a LOT of money but hid it off balance sheet.

So, even assuming this reflects his actual words - which I don't think people should assume - all we have here is Hunt saying that his remarks were meant to be ironic followed by his *personal* opinion on the issue.

Jibe looks a real talent. Happy to have a go. Again injured at the wrong time in Spring, but had the beating of defenders and goalies. He hit the woodwork on numerous occasions, so how many might he have scored if his confidence had been lifted by one of those frame rattlers finding the back of the net?

To be more specific, that the Cyber's return to London from the void was possible because of some event - the cracks - weakening the walls of the universe. This is never spelled out explicitly though, so is open to interpretation.

Additionally, once the Cracks arc had completed, RTD mentioned that he thought that the Cardiff Rift - which originally appeared in Series 1, of course, had probably closed along with the cracks. 

So overall, with one interpretation of a hint, and a bit of out-of-universe retconning, you could say that they were around during Tennant time, and before.

You are still free to express those ideas. It is your decision if you decide you do not want others to express their criticism of you. So for me, free expression is entirely relevant here.

What it boils down to, for me, is that some time free expression leads to a consensus coming down that some people don't like. It's as simple as that. Some people just don't like the consensus or outcome in various scenarios. But if they're trying to say that it's an attack on free expression, not only is that massively hypocritical, it's also total fucking bullshit imo.

If everyone tells you that you're a dickhead, that's fee expression in action. You're still free to be a dickhead. Your employers are free to fire you for being a dickhead if it affects them.

Did he really say either of these things? I thought he wanted an end to unsocial hours payments and for weekends to be considered the same as other weekdays. He's also painted consultants as the privileged elite who get to decide whether to work weekends as opposed to staff further down the chain who don't have that choice. In reality, by the time a doctor has reached consultant level, they'll have regularly sacrificed weekends, nights, and much of their family/social time - only to commit to more on call weekends and nights. 

When it comes to training, I'm also sceptical - the new GPs he promised have turned out to be a proposal for people only 2 years out of medical school practicing as specialty doctors, without the extra 3 years of training GPs do. The shape of training review also means that consultant training takes less time, meaning consultants have less experience (so that junior consultants will exist and can get paid less).",null,0,null,1437308576,null,0,false,0,ct8kiqj,null,t3_3dqa4f,null,t1_ct8kiqj,null,t1_ct8gx14,null,null,null,1440473250,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Even allowing for the size difference (Bristol is approx 0.5 million population, Birmingham is 1 million) it is still obvious that Bristol is more expensive.

Other than that there is plenty of evidence here on this sub, lots of old posts with people saying how expensive rent is here and how difficult it is to find a place, even though it's anecdotal hopefully that will help you prove the point.

It ignores the fact that Indian regions by that point were run by Indians, and that Britain ran the central government at the time but not individual regions.

The central government fairly ham fistedly allowed for exports from Bengal initially at the demand of other regional Indian governors who relied on trade to make their money, and it was only once the severity of the famine actually became clear that the UK imposed a ban on export of grain from Bengal to other Indian regions.

On top of this, the reason for the massive food shortage, something of course not even mentioned in this hack-job, is that India at the time couldn't feed itself, and relied upon rice imports from Burma, which produced far more rice than it needed, to keep India fed. Of course Burma was invaded and occupied by the Japanese in 1942, so India was inevitably going to have famine. Whether food was allowed to leave Bengal or not was never going to change whether there was famine or not, just the degree of severity.

Now, where you get into culpability is in the analysis of whether the UK actually intentionally took grain from Bengal or not, and as I've pointed out, while the central (British run) government was fairly incompetent in their approach to this matter, it was, depressingly (and always glossed over, by the way), more a matter of Indian regional governors and tradesmen who simply didn't want to stop earning their money from trading Bengali food produce who pushed the British to keep trade open, not really caring that food supplies should have been travelling the other way (as plenty of other Indian regions had surpluses at the time, but these were sold on the markets rather than given to Bengal, the callous but profitable option).

In short, we British were incompetent, many Indians were utterly uncaring and indifferent to the famine, and the Japanese doomed several million people to death.",null,0,null,1437309483,null,0,1437309750,0,ct8krga,null,t3_3dpm6a,null,t1_ct8krga,null,t1_ct7mcaw,null,null,null,1437991510,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

In my position now, with a lust for a paid career in programming, what would you suggest I do? I really do have a lot of skills, that I wish I could just sit down with someone and say ""Tell me what to do, and I'll do it infront of you"". Or ""Give me a project and I'll complete it, for free, to prove to you"".

I can't give up the fight to get to where I want to get to. I have spent so long developing my skills in many areas. I am also very good at SEO. I can get pages indexed and ranked in Google using content alone (no paid guest posting, or backlink spam techniques).

My knowledge of security is excellent. I've developed PoC for router hardward vendors where I demonstrate how I exploited their hardware with a buffer overflow. I've written fuzzers, and PoC's that show how I can access a persons iPhone via their wifi and sniff their traffic (inc. HTTPS).

But I can't get any where near a company to prove this. I even applied to Facebook, and they said no chance because of the hacking.

I've been convicted, and sentanced for what I done. Trust me, a year in prison is not something I want to repeat. Ever. Again, getting this across to a potential employer is hard.

I think all I can do now is focus on one area of work. I.e Python Developer, and get everything on Guthub. Build up my Stack Overflow account. Finish the Eular Project. And I guess I'll be on track to at least trying to put things right.

I have to keep fighting to get to where I want to get to, otherwise there seems no purpose in life. The events over the weekend have made me revaluate a lot.

As far as I know, all current accounts give you a debit card in the UK. I don't know anyone who doesn't have one.

Banks usually want ID and proof of address when you're setting up an account with them - not sure about how you'd get the second one sorted being from abroad. Hopefully someone who has done something similar can shed some more light on that for you.

2) I use O2 and live in London. I wouldn't bother with them as the signal is shoddy despite this being a major city. My girlfriend is on EE and she always has full signal and 4G, but the highest data allowance they offer is 20GB so if you're after unlimited data then Three is your only option as far as I know.

There's no mobile signal at all on the Underground but there is free wifi provided by Virgin which you can get access to through being a customer of various other companies (EE for example). I've found it's fairly worthless unless you're waiting on a platform and doesn't work at all when the trains are moving. My advice would be to stock up your phone/tablet with games/books/movies and stuff that doesn't need an internet connection to be used for when you're travelling on the Tube.

3) At a conservative estimate I would say as you're planning on living alone that your gas &amp; electricity will be about £50/month. That's roughly what I pay with two of us in a 1 bed flat. Water is a set amount every 6 months (at least it is where I am) and is around £140 for that time. You'll also have to pay council tax which is dependent on where you live and the type of property you're in. You can find out more about that [here](https://www.gov.uk/council-tax/working-out-your-council-tax).

In terms of £1k being enough, put Zone 1 right out of your mind. Stupid prices. Zone 2 you might be OK to get a studio somewhere but it won't be the nicest. Zone 3 is probably your best bet. Whereabouts are you going to be working? Best to base where you want to leave on ease of access to public transport. I'd recommend trying to live as near to a Tube station as possible as it's such a massive convenience. I can give you some advice on where to live if you let me know a rough idea of where you'll be working and what sort of area you're looking for.

Sharing is also a good option and will save you a lot of money. I haven't done it personally so can't speak from experience but you'll be much better of financially because the rent is cheaper and you'll be splitting bills.

Ings will barely feature and will be dubbed 'deadwood' and 'a flop' by Janurary

Benteke will at first look like a great signing, scoring 6-7 goals in his first 10 games but will eventually fade away and score a goal every 4th game.

Lallana will play decently and not get injured but nonetheless not be in the starting 11.

Can will not get enough game time due to Lucas performing admirably and as a result will not improve on last season and will lose the hype surrounding him.

Markovic will barely feature because Ibe will be preferred unless he does something re'Mark'able.

Moreno and Clyne will have shaky seasons and overall our defence won't improve a great deal.

Gomez will be great when he plays and many will question why Rodgers doesn't play him over Clyne or Moreno.

Allen will fail to take the starting spot away from Lucas and will find himself 3rd choice at DM after Can.

Origi will pretty much only feature as a sub and in cup games and there will be rumours he is 'unsettled at Anfield'.

If Benteke impresses as a lone striker then Sturridge will be sold at the end of the season due to his wages being too high for a sub.

Firmino and Coutinho will be good but not world class but will still get hyped up by the media a great deal receiving some funny acronym similar to SAS.

Hendo and Milner will be our stand out players and Hodgson will make them play cm for England together heading into the euros.

If he is played a few times Teixera will be really solid and present himself as great backup for Coutinho.

Ojo will be loaned out again in September or January depending on training performance.

Wisdom will be sold for a really low fee in January after failing to make more than 3 appearances.

Flanagan will return from injury but will look a shadow of his former self, he will make the first team a few times but will eventually be dropped Manquillo style.

Lambert and Enrique will stay at the club but will assume more of an ambassador role and get pretty much no playing time, Lambert will announce his retirement in March.

Despite shaky fullbacks the defence will be pretty solid and Mignolet will come 2nd in the golden glove after Courtois.

We will score more goals than previously and concede fewer but we will still not be good enough to get a champions league spot due to Man Utd improving and finishing 1st or 2nd.

True it's not. Nothing is without danger. Nothing. However the danger is nowhere near to the amount you either think or have been laid to believe.

For a start let's say that the Caliphate is more important to particular Sunni muslims, more than it is for Shia muslims. Even though I'm still talking in generalisations I'd suggest we make the distinction between sunni muslims and shia muslims. 

Additionally, I should point out that for a time the Ottoman Sultan would equally play the role of Kalif. Being Kalif doesn't necessarily give you any secular/earthly power, it's more the guy who judges how best to maintain and manage the community. 

The interesting thing about the Caliph since Muhammeds death hasn't just been the sunni-shia political disputes, but the quasi-electoral element in deciding who *is* Caliph. Some muslims view this kind of handling of who becomes caliph as the germinal form of an ""islamic democracy."" Between that and the idea of ""Shura"" which translates roughly to consultation, usually a consultation of those whom decisions affect.

Actually it is taxable. All of it because you earn above the personal allowance. I take it you've not registered with HMRC as self employed then? You're required to regardless of whether you make a profit or not.

Anyway if you're crap with money you want to put it somewhere where you can't take it out for a couple of years. £100 a week would see £5000 built up in a year and then interest on top.

We pretty much spent all the money from Sterling on Benteke, the vault is empty. Furthermore, Pedro is the classic outside forward that Barcalona uses, someone who doesn't play the line, but is closer on goal looking to be a scorer or a passer. With the purchase of Benteke and the players we already have in the squad, a more pure winger would be a better fit, since we're now gonna have to form our squad around Benteke, because thats apparently a great idea. We only really have Ibe and Markovic in the squad who are these kind of wingers, Lallana, Coutinho and Firmino are all better central and Rodgers promised Milner he would play central. Which is also why I sincerely doubt that Markovic were ever on the verge of being sold. 

If we sign another offensive player, id reckon it would be a more pure winger who plays wide, probably both sides and is a good crosser, maybe even a good defender. He'll probably be pretty cheap too, and I would imagine it would only happen if 2 or even 3 of Borini, Lambert, Enrique and Balotelli were sold.

Milner will be the stand out of the first half of the season, inspiring the team and working well with Hendo.

Benteke will surprise a lot of people, not a stand out season but a good 12 to 15 goals. Studge will come back and struggle to meet form but will play off benteke really well.

At the same time, I've seen the excesses of New Labour (which, yes, did do some terrific things in government, but was nowhere near perfect), and I see Labour poised to do the same things again, to sacrifice its goal and reason for existing to win big at the election.  And I just don't feel I can let that happen.

That's why I'm voting Jeremy Corbyn, because he convinces me the most that he's in this to change lives or die trying, and not just power-at-any-cost.  _He_ isn't perfect either IMO (homeopathy, Argentina, party-splitting, etc.), but he ticks more of the boxes for me than do any of the other three candidates (with Yvette as my second pref ATM).

The Greens don't have the traction Labour does, approach their politics from what I think is a noble but effectively less relevant trajectory, and they tend to be somewhat... strange on certain policies.

EDIT: Oh, and there's the case of family tradition (even though this doesn't really count for much these days).  My parents are Labour, my grandparents on my dad's side were Labour, my grandpa was a union man and though I'm not sure how much he invested into the party I still got a 'oh, you're X's grandson, aren't you?' when I joined in 2010.

However, I disagree that these things mean we are a big club in the grand scheme of things. Look at Nottingham Forest. One league trophy, 2 FA cups, 4 League Cups, 2 European Cups. According to Andy Dunn's criteria, they would also qualify as a 'big club acting small time'. 

As we know, a club cannot trade on past glories and their name alone. We haven't finished in the top four of the Premiership since 1996. That's nearly 20 years. How can we call ourselves a truly 'big club' when we haven't finished in the top four for that long?

We are in a transition period. We have struggled since Martin O'Neill left us with an overly-expensive squad, and are only now looking like we have cleared the vast majority of dead wood. 

Out of all the clubs that aren't currently top-four, I believe that with the right management/signings, we have the best chance and infrastructure to become a 'big club' again. However, we have to face facts that we have no choice but to act 'small time' at the moment. We have no pulling power aside from our history, and our potential. 

We're making good signings, and I am genuinely excited for the start of the season for the first time in years. The rebuild won't be done overnight, but until a club is finishing in the top six regularly, they will always be seen as a small club in comparison to the big guys (E.g. Man City, Man United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham).

Unwise? Perhaps. Worth losing his job over? Absolutely not. The damage a quip like that does is so insignificant compared to everything else he does/was doing overall. Even if you consider that specific event on its own, in a vacuum: as I said, he went on to clarify and encourage women in science.

Now if you weigh that sentiment up against his ironic joke, I think there is a net positive.

Quoting from [this recent DECC report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/277211/Water.pdf):

&gt;However in the UK the regulations
prevent this fluid contaminating water sources by requiring the operator to:

*   make appropriate plans for storing fluid safely, and not in open pits
*   design the site so spills are avoided (and are contained if they do happen)
*   dispose of flowback fluid safely

So, there is a legal reason why they do things differently in this country (and note I use present tense there, there's a been a fair amount of onshore drilling in the UK for decades, we have the largest onshore oil and gas field in western Europe.)

No-one ever listens when I say this, despite the fact that I'm actually a professional whose job it is to look after this shit, but DECC are pretty hardcore, and you do not fuck about with them or their regs. DECC say ""no oil based drilling fluid goes into the water"" so no oil based drilling fluid goes into the water. If any amount more than none goes in, it has to be reported and were I not to do so my company would be liable for large fines and I would lose my job, potentially also facing criminal charges if the release was severe or intentional.",null,0,null,1437313796,null,0,1437314184,0,ct8m4xh,null,t3_3dtk2t,null,t1_ct8m4xh,null,t1_ct8lx3b,null,null,null,1437992703,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

And I think paracetamol and fluoride are deadly - I'll be on the right side of history when *that* bombshell hits, right?

&gt;Personally I would like to see fracking approached int the way that GM food has been. Slowly with controls in place before its taken up whole sale. 

GM food has been proven safe for decades. Pussyfooting around it to appease nutter environmentalists has only served to discredit GM food in the minds of laypeople. Trying to discredit fracking with baby-steps ""well, lets just take it slowly and be super cautious and see how it goes"" is up there with ""teaching the controversy"" about ~~creationism~~ Intelligent Design.  

&gt;The difference between MMR vaccine truthers and fracking is that fracking seems to have a mass of statistical data attached to it that alludes to health issues.

There's been plenty of quack-science produced in the wake of Wakefield's study that antivac loons hold onto.

Supermarkets mean that living by seasonal food is a luxury for people who want it, normally people get food from the supermarket where everything is shipped or flown in from wherever it is in season. E.g. asparagus often from Peru, samphire from Israel, etc etc. To look for a situation where food must be had seasonally, preserved or not at all, you must go back 50 years. That is why no-one really responded to that part of your question.

Cooking costs relatively little. The energy company gave me a smart meter, so I can say it costs about 30 US cents (I am actually in the UK) to roast a joint for 3 people, that is 1+ hour of the oven on. And boiling food will be cheaper.

Like many people, I use cans or stuff if I am back late from work or need to eat quickly. I hate ready meals, and do not eat or buy them if I can avoid it.

Even if De Gea leaves United won't suffer as much since they can replace him with another quality keeper. It will be hard for Liverpool to replace Sterling with another player of his quality.

null,false,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,null,"That's a big question to be honest.

To keep things as simple as I can, offshore this is how it works:

Fluids are generally made onshore at mixing plants, they are then transferred to a boat and held in steel tanks which are fully sealed. At this point a bridge officer is responsible for the fluids aboard. When the boat arrives to the rig I get the deck crew to pressure test the large hoses we use to transfer the fluids from the ship to the rig, these are pressure tested to above the pressures that will be used for taking on fluids and at least one man is assigned for hose watching during this process to ensure no fluids are escaping. Once hoses are tested, if the weather is OK and there is light, then we can transfer the fluids from the ship to the rig, again with a minimum of one man hose watching the entire time. Once aboard, they are my responsibility, along with that of the engineer who covers the other 12 hours.

On the rig they are placed into ""pits"" (steel tanks) which have weight ratings, so we have an upper weight limit we can store in them, which is of course well below the actual maximum weight. We send these fluids downhole, they come back out, yadda yadda, hole gets drilled, fluids get circulated in what's called a ""closed system"".

Once we're done with the fluids, since DECC pretty much forbid dumping of any potentially harmful chemicals (and then some), they're going back to shore. So the same boat process but in reverse. Now, many fluids are simply reconditioned to whatever spec is required for the next job and sent back out, and can last for years. When a fluid is finally unusable, it's thermally desorped (incineration without the fire, but just a high dry heat). This separates out the volatile organic compounds and other organics from the rest of the fluid components which are then reused if it's economically viable or combusted if not, ending up as CO2, water, and some solid soot, just as you get from any car engine or power plant.

This isn't America where you just cowboy-job the whole lot, bury pits of fluids and assume no-one will notice. Every day I have fluids I've got custody of those, I'm responsible for them, and I compile a tracking report for DECC daily, which is submitted weekly by the operator to show that I'm fully aware of every single chemical or product which has been used aboard my rig for drilling.

**TL;DR**: The oil parts ends up being combusted like petrol is, the water is evaporated, most non-oil parts are generally safe to be released to the environment in sufficiently low concentrations that they have a scientifically insignificant effect on the locale, if they're not safe, they have to be chemically treated until they are, and can then be released once rendered harmless.",null,0,null,1437315462,null,0,false,0,ct8mrdo,null,t3_3dtk2t,null,t1_ct8mrdo,null,t1_ct8lqaw,null,null,null,1437993158,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

null,false,gamas,,Labour Member,null,"Although I am now edging toward Yvette, the reason is that despite the narrative given to us, the Labour party isn't run as some kind of dictatorship. Him being the leader won't instantly turn Labour into some idealist left party. He is still required to listen to his cabinet and advisors, and its 2020 manifesto will be the result of a long negotiation process with party members.

I don't support the Greens because they are too green sky thinking. They have a lot of visions about what Britain should be, and I agree with that long-term vision. However, as the most exposure to how government works is through their one elected MP and several counsellors and devolved assembly/parliament members, they haven't got a credible plan as to what they need to do in order to achieve that goal. Their 2015 manifesto was a nice idea, but didn't contain anything solid enough to make you think ""This is a credible plan"".

Labour, on the other hand, is one of the three established parties. They've run the country several times, and have a lot of experience as to the harsh realities of government. A Corbyn-led Labour wouldn't be ""Corbyn's grand socialist experiment"", it would be Corbyn's vision tempered towards the centre by the sensibilities and experience of Labour.

And it's not like Corbyn is like the Greens himself. His vision is already fairly tempered by experience. He takes on active diplomatic roles and knows what he is doing. His views are already tempered by a high-degree of pragmatism.

EDIT: To give an example of how this might work. I don't think Corbyn's unilateral nuclear disarmament would make it into the 2020 manifesto. What is more likely is to promise to launch an extensive diplomatic mission to encourage multilateral disarmament across the globe, with an inquiry into more cost-effective defence strategies in the UK in the meantime.

EDIT2: To give an example of how Corbyn is more pragmatic than the Greens. The Greens proposal for education was just scrap tuition fees, and cancel student debt, and raise education funding, without any statement on how on earth they could possibly fund this. Meanwhile, one of Corbyn's plan (the other is essentially increase national insurance contributions by 7% and raising the tax threshold for high-income earner) is ""Income tax receipts are due to increase by £15 billion between 2019/20 and 2020/21. We should use two-thirds of that to reduce student debt - by scrapping fees and restoring grants - and use the remaining one-third to reduce the national debt"". Whether or not you agree with Corbyn's plan, his plan at least acknowledges that the money has to come from somewhere. That's the difference between the Greens and the Labour left, the Greens like to pretend money simply doesn't exist and thus throw free things everywhere, meanwhile the Labour left recognises that you need to have money in order to redistribute it.",null,0,null,1437315619,null,0,1437321934,0,ct8mto0,null,t3_3dtnnf,null,t1_ct8mto0,null,t3_3dtnnf,null,null,null,1437993208,null,3,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3,null

In 1933? Yes. And while you throw around the [""classist bigot""](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3dr5nz/queens_nazi_salute_footage_is_matter_of/ct83xvt) phrase, I might call it classist to assume that the working classes of Bradford, in pre-welfare state Britain, in a time of massive unemployment, would have dedicated much time to the leisurely study of international politics. It's classist to assume that the upper-class and elite-based focus of most history is reflected in the attitudes and concerns of people who work. 

And even talking about the concerns of the upper classes, in 1933, Winston Churchill was still on his India kick. He wouldn't make his first Commons speech on Nazi Germany until November 1934. 

&gt; The Morning Star newspaper was founded in 1930 [...] I can't find circulation figures for the Morning Star but the Daily Herald had a circulation of 1,082,000 in 1930.

And this is all relevant how? Many have heard of the Morning Star; CPGB aligned and Communist International-subsidized. The *Daily Worker's* peak circulation was [122,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Star_%28British_newspaper%29#Finances_and_circulation) in 1947. Not anything approaching one million. 

Do you have any evidence that the Daily Herald was running a *sustained* anti-Nazi campaign in 1933? If not, this is just fallacious.

Tell me this, if these newspapers and the working classes were organizing in Britain against the Nazis in 1933, show me the mass pro-war public demonstrations in Trafalgar Square that occurred when the Nazis remilitarised the Rhineland in 1936? Show me one. Please. Anywhere in Britain, for that matter.

&gt; The working-class in Britain in the early 20th Century had a history, we aren't talking about aliens.

Correct. We're not. Just you.

Why on earth are you making this about class? It's a simple and common problem of history; the problems later generations cared to study weren't the same ones the people living at the time cared about.

First thing is a decent looking CV. The amount of CVs that I've seen with spelling mistakes, and are poorly organised is quite disappointing. 

Use nice fonts like Calibri, don't use plain black colour - try a dark dark grey. It might not look like much, but it makes it look less stark. 

Separate each section with titles in coloured font. Just things like that - make it nice to read. 

Understand the company your looking to work for and understand their products!!! 

And if you put a specific language as your core area of ability. Know it. 

We've had a few interviewees who have stated that they're competent in xyz. When one of our senior developers ask them simple basic questions around it they don't know it. So i guess extending from that: don't lie.

http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/saving/article-3010018/Has-Chancellor-George-Osborne-s-radical-Budget-reform-killed-cash-Isa.html


Here's some information about that. The top 4 points in bullet points are a quick summary on the article.

However, with an ISA, you can save in stocks and shares, as well as cash.

That means, you can invest money in stocks and shares, wrapped in an ISA, and pay no additional tax ~~(apart from the 10% already withheld)~~ on any dividend income, or any realised gains on disposal (so no capital gains tax).

You will soon get an allowance soon as per the new budget for any dividends you receive anyway for around £5k (correct me if I'm wrong someone).

Equities, generally, have a positive trend in terms of growth **in the long run** - and with the added benefit of paying no capital gains tax - if you buy some shares now for £1 each, and sell them for £10 a year later, then you're laughing.

However, it all of course depends on your taste for risk. If you're a risky person, then you have to understand that you could get nothing back if the market turns.",null,0,null,1437317149,null,0,1437603444,0,ct8ng5b,null,t3_3dtph2,null,t1_ct8ng5b,null,t3_3dtph2,null,null,null,1437993694,null,4,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,4,null

What are current wholesale prices for a litre of vodka? I agree that it probably will put up wholesale prices but without knowing what the actual difference is, it's impossible to know how big or small of an impact that new minimum pricing level will have. 

Say for example a litre of vodka can be had for £11.07, which is the minimum unless the duty isn't being passed along(0.4*£27.66/litre pure alcohol), and the new minimum is £20.00/litre of vodka, the per 25ml shot price goes from 28p to 50p. If we say £2.50 is the current price point, which may be low or high for Cardiff I don't know, then the purchase cost per shot as a percentage of the sales prices rises from 11.2% to 20%. That might be enough to tip some institutions over the edge, but again, without context and knowing each individual venues books, it's hard to know.  

In any case, a potential workaround would be to mandate that the minimum price was only in place for consumer-facing sales. Institutions with licences to resell alcohol to the public would be exempt, except being bound by law to not resell at below the minimum unit price. That would close the competition gap between bars and off licences/supermarkets, still have the same effect of raising drinking prices for the public, and potentially give the bar industry a shot in the arm.

Whilst the Scottish referendum has taught us not to be complacent with polls, that view is not consistent with current polling. 

For starters, regarding Greece, [polling has British voters on the side of the Troika](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/07/02/british-voters-side-troika-greek-debt-crisis/) - and let's be honest our media has the public thoroughly convinced that Greece are just large scale benefit scroungers...  Polling on remaining in the EU is still [pretty much on the yes side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_referendum_on_United_Kingdom_membership_of_the_European_Union#Standard_polling_on_EU_membership), though it's close enough that the campaign will make all the difference.

So I wouldn't exactly be pessimistic about the EU referendum..

In fact, it was not only anti-judaism that was preached in Hitler's book but anti-communism, a practice which was brutally upheld by the allies themselves subsequently leading to millions dead in proxy wars we fought in the name of eradicating communism.

There are two reasons why at the time the holocaust was condemned. It's not specifically because we all suddenly decided that not liking Jews is wrong but because of the huge scale of the Nazi operation to eliminate the Jews along with the general barbarity of it and that we also needed to justify everything we had done to win the war. After presenting Hitler as practically as evil manifest, there's little argument about our carpet bombing of cities. It was actually quite convenient that we could find atrocities they had committed that made our own questionable activities insignificant. If Hitler had merely evicted the Jews and other undesirables, or had interned them somewhere, no one would have cared.

In fact, there's no way you can connect a book and killing millions of Jews in a meaningful way. It's a pointless association.

Yes, I was, and I'll say it again. It's doubtful any person living in 1933 on his road in Bradford could have named any contemporary European leader. Unemployment was 20% in the UK, 30% in Glasgow, the men (and it was mostly men at this time) who were employed were on reduced hours, and they weren't all sitting around a cafe reading the New Statesman, the Daily Worker, or whatever tripe in their spare time. The youth of Bradford weren't doing Nazi salutes, because they never saw news reels of how to do them in the first place. They were looking for work. Germany had an unstable government and had been changing leaders on a rather frequent basis, and France for that matter had a new government almost every year during the latter parts of the Third Republic. And Britain obviously didn't have a 21st-century state education system, with a 21st-century curriculum, in 1933.

As long as we're asking each other for evidence, please show me some that the masses of working class people followed continental politics intently during the time.

**Username:** /u/TheDrCK        
**Original Post:**          
&gt;**About the product**

The modular RM series is a great bit of kit, running silently up to 40% load, and producing barely 25dB even at 100% load. In the words of [Guru3D](http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/corsair_rm_650_watt_gold_psu_review,7.html):

&gt;The RM 650 definitely belongs where it is positioned, in the upper range of mainstream even towards high-end series. The power supply does what the doctor ordered, it's really silent and the efficiency was very respectable. This Gold certified PSU we think is spot on, at certain loads even closing in to Platinum levels.

The PSU is modular and uses low-profile cables to help you save on space.

**Condition**

The item is factory sealed and thus comes with all original packaging. It'll be shipped via recorded delivery in a parcel with appropriate padding to ensure the product reaches you in perfect condition.

**Price**

I'm selling the PSU for £80 inclusive of delivery costs. The units currently retail between £90-100, depending where you shop. 

Payment via Paypal.

That said, hydraulic fracturing = hydrofracking = fracking = hydraulic fracturing. The principle is the same, you force a fluid down the wellbore at sufficiently high pressures to create fractures across the pay zone. These are often then injected with sand or other proppant types to keep the fractures open. You are correct to say that we've been doing it since the 1960's, although I think have gotten to the conclusion that what's being explored now onshore at shale sites is somehow fundamentally different to what we've been doing for decades, which it isn't.

""Slickwater"" just means the fluid being used is non-viscous (so essentially, water alone as the frack fluid would qualify, although isn't really used alone any more afaik). Alternatives would be to use viscous frack fluids which contain cross-linked polymers or other compounds which increase gel strength and yield point (we're dealing with non-newtonian fluids here so it's slightly complicated, but...think like gelatin or yoghurt, it's a fluid but it's thick).

Slickwaters in the US generally include friction reducing agents, biocides to inhibit bacterial growth, scale inhibitors to prevent scale formation, sometimes surfactants (fairy liquid essentially) to lower surface tension, and sometimes things like H2S inhibitors.

In the UK, Cuadrilla use polymer friction reducers, salt, some acid and some biocide.",null,0,null,1437319911,null,0,1437320218,0,ct8ootb,null,t3_3dtk2t,null,t1_ct8ootb,null,t1_ct8oenb,null,null,null,1437994599,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

He is very technical and not simply a big person.  Though as a big person he draws more than one defender freeing up other players.

null,false,dystopian_now,cnty-england,England,null,"&gt;Yes, I was, and I'll say it again. It's doubtful any person living in 1933 on his road in Bradford could have named any contemporary European leader. Unemployment was 20% in the UK, 30% in Glasgow, the men (and it was mostly men at this time) who were employed were on reduced hours, and they weren't all sitting around a cafe reading the New Statesman, the Daily Worker, or whatever tripe in their spare time. The youth of Bradford weren't doing Nazi salutes, because they never saw news reels of how to do them in the first place. They were looking for work. Germany had an unstable government and had been changing leaders on a rather frequent basis, and France for that matter had a new government almost every year during the latter parts of the Third Republic. And Britain obviously didn't have a 21st-century state education system, with a 21st-century curriculum, in 1933.

This is all based on conjecture rather than evidence, the Daily Herald had a circulation of over a million. Being unemployed did not mean that you were not politically aware or active, in fact organisation of the unemployed was more organised then that it is now. People were not simply ignorantly staggering around for food.

[The National Unemployed Workers Movement](http://www.wcml.org.uk/our-collections/protest-politics-and-campaigning-for-change/unemployment/national-unemployed-workers-movement/) was active from 1921 and dedicated to direct action on behalf of the poorest.

Likewise, on the subject of Spain not only did 4,000 people go from Britain to fight fascism far before Britain declared war on Germany but working-class people in Britain aided the Spanish Second Republic in [other ways](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/explorefurther/digital/scw/more/aid/).

I really do think that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. At a time in which the circulation of a Labour newspaper exceeded one million and leaders of prominence and notoriety like Mussolini existed then you really are going to have to go out and find primary sources evidencing this mass ignorance. If the Daily Herald, a Labour newspaper, was in mass circulation and was writing about Mussolini (and it was) then that would require its predominantly working-class readership to simply ignore or forget the name of Mussolini half the time they picked up a newspaper. Likewise with Stalin and any number of leaders!

Pathetic.

Most people use age as a means to draw a line in the sand between childhood and adulthood. I prefer to use another metric: belief in the supernatural parent. 

Children see their parents to be supernatural. Eventually though reality sinks in and they are forced to realise they are nothing of the sort.

Some children have the courage to see reality for what it is and accept the responsibility that comes with it - that there is no supernatural parent and that we are ultimately responsible for our own destiny here and now.

Those who can't accept the responsibility reality imposes so clearly upon us - responsible adults? No. They are the ""children of God"".

I'm sure you weren't, but that is counter to my original point.  The number, and bredth of the people a government would have to lock up if it was simply ""pirated a film"" would absolutely cripple an economy.

I actually have more faith in unskilled manual labourers too -- I doubt you get as much production out of them when you lock them up rather than reward them.  Anyone who costs more than they can earn to lock up is a net loss because it's costing you more to get that labour for ""free""; anyone who is less productive when locked up is a net loss because you lose that additional production.

From a purely economic perspective: you'd better be sure that when you lock someone up that the gains from having them not being actively destructive out in the world outweigh the cost of locking them up.  For example: we're all more productive when we feel safer.

As I said previously, I actually think there are a number of players that are really underrated by fans and media alike (Giroud, Ospina, Cazorla). 

But again, to rate Wilshire over Hendo at this point is a bit silly honestly. Wilshire has obviously been more highly touted because of his obvious potential, but he has only been able to display flashes of his quality due to his injury history. Hendo's durability, work rate, and his accomplishments on the field are all part of why, to this point, he has been, and still is, the better player. If Wilshire can manage to stay healthy (which is a big if), he could absolutely become a better player than Hendo. While I think it's possible, I don't think it's likely, much the same as I don't think it's likely for Sturridge to get healthy enough consistently enough to become the best striker in the Premier League. 

I have a hard time seeing Hendo being thought of as overrated. He is what he is, and as our captain and our engine he's a huge part of our club. Maybe we just don't have a lot else to talk about, and it seems strange to fans of other teams why we go on and on about a solid, blue-collar midfielder who keeps improving each season. Sorry?

Play much better attacking football and challenge for top 4 only to finish 5 because of a poor defence.

Milner - Begin well with Hendo in midfield only to be found out later in the year defensively. Will end the year on the wing

Bogdan - Cup goalie

Ings - Becomes a super sub and get 3+ match winning goals  over the season

Clyne - TOTY performance but will not be noticed due to Liverpools overall poor defence. 5+ assists

Firminho - Will struggle until Sturridge is back and then will be fire. 20 league goals/assists

Gomez - Starts 1 game and plays well. Sub start to think he is the best player ever.

Benteke - Won't start when Sturridge is back. 15 goals over the whole season and enough of a contribution to justify the £32m paid

**Rest of the league**

Chelsea and United to battle it out for the title, Chelsea eventually winning by a clear margin.

Arsenal to start poorly and fans want Wenger out. Will have a great run and finish 3rd easily.

Man City to scrape 4th, Raheem to get 15 goals/assists but blamed for poor season

Southampton to finish above Spurs

Watford to finish in the top 10

The shop is great if you want to learn more about local Bristol history, lots of stuff in there.

The [M-Shed](http://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/m-shed/) is another free museum in Bristol. That's more focused, covering the history of Bristol, though I would have liked some more depth in certain areas (e.g., I'd enjoy a more extensive display on musical developments in the city, like '90s trip hop).

Plenty of nice walks around Bristol. E.g., Troopers Hill, Ashton Court. Also lots of pleasant bike rides too, like the one I did recently next to a river (can't remember exactly where that was, but I think it was somewhere around Eastville Park). You could walk that too, of course. We ended at a pub with a lovely beer garden.

No, they were original characters made up for *A Good Man Goes To War*. Aside from the regular episodes they're in a few web shorts.

It's explained in the episode. IIRC:

Vastra's hibernation chamber was destroyed during construction of the London Underground, killing most of her fellow Silurians inside. She was hunting humans in revenge until the Doctor talked her out of it and helped her integrate into human society in Victorian London, settling down with Jenny.

The Doctor saved Strax's life. Strax owed the Doctor a debt of honor so he became a nurse, in contradiction to the rest of his people (The Sontarans are a warrior race).

The fact is Labour misused them as a way to cover up vast over expenditure. You even said this in you own post! It's also bollocks to say that no one criticised their use until recently. They were criticised heavily back in the day for covering up public finances. They were even criticised by Labour when they were being used by the Major Government!

Also, none of what you have said has disproved my initial point. The post which I was originally responding to said Labour didn't spend much money.

None of the contenders are as bad as Milliband in terms of image to be fair. His voice, his look and his message were awful. I'd worry Kendall would get torn apart by interviewers, she's very naive. Corbyn would need to be seen a lot more than Milliband was or face a similar issue of the press creating his image for him. Cooper and Burnham come across as career politicians and I think that ship has sailed. I think most agree that our hope of a leader that was media friendly went with Jarvis not putting his hat in the ring. 

The more interesting question is about reshaping the left wing message for the 21st century. Issues like civil liberties, ownership of data and decentralisation of services should be at the heart of it for me. Also cleaning up politics and making it more democratic. 

UKIP won a lot of traction with things like right of recall and direct democracy. I think the new left is far less authoritarian than the old left, I'm not sure any of the candidates get this. 

I'll get stick for this because of the messenger, but Russel Brand suggests devolving power but still wants state owned energy, infrastructure, health, education, etc. I think this is a fairly common view. People can understand running essential services for the common good, if as a party we refuse to consider this for ideological reasons we won't be relevant. Conversely people want less government intrusion and more decision making ability at a local level, especially around council services and planning. 

We also need to grow up about Europe. It's not working for a lot of people and that needs to change. It's not about benefit claimants it's about freedom of movement of people. The tide has turned on this and an awful lot of people across the spectrum no longer see a benefit to allowing labour from cheaper countries in with no restrictions. This is a central EU policy so the party have to come to terms with the fact that a lot of the working class simply will not vote for the status quo. This was a massive tactical error in the last election. We came across as piously telling people they were wrong and shouldn't have a say. It's a tough one but we need a policy that shows we understand and want to change the issues with the EU.",null,0,null,1437324287,null,0,1437324716,0,ct8qu52,null,t3_3du5bk,null,t1_ct8qu52,null,t3_3du5bk,null,null,null,1437996408,null,5,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,5,null

If you were to receive over £15,000 you would receive equal monthly installments with additional payments in February and July. What subject would you be doing it for? The grants vary greatly depending on this.

However, to be eligibility criteria is that you are expected to seek a teaching post in England upon completion of your ITT. You would be in breach of this. You also stated below that you haven't graduated, you probably don't realise quite how competitive PGCE places are. There are a limited number of spaces set by the government. It is rare for people to get onto courses having just finished university, especially if they have no relevant work experience. Having stated that you don't actually intend to teach, I doubt you have done this. I also doubt that you would be able to convince any course providers of your genuine interest. If you did manage to you would be taking the place of someone who actually wants a teaching career. 

In addition to this a PGCE course will not be like your other time spent at university. You will be essentially working a full time job at a school whilst also being required to complete your usual university assignments, including essays. It is NOT easy. PGCE courses actually have an incredibly high drop out rate for this reason, people think it is a doss option, which just isn't the case. 

Not to mention during your time doing a PGCE (if you got onto one) you would be teaching children. Would it be fair on those students to have someone who is completely uncommitted to them? Is that the best they can expect from the education system.

Not just standing on the sidelines shouting about inequality and injustice, but actually trying to do something about it.

In my view Labour is - or should be - a left wing movement with genuine and realistic aspirations to govern progressively, and it should, I think, be a home to people of varying degrees of 'left'.

Nope. If this happened in the UK, you would probably be arrested, detained for a few hours, given a formal caution and told to fuck off. A caution is basically a written warning from the police saying you're a naughty boy and not to do it again, though it technically counts as a conviction.

An enhanced CRB check (it's now known as a DBS check) contacts all police forces in the UK to ask them for any records they hold on you. This is only permitted when an applicant would be working with children or other vulnerable groups - and even then, the offences they'd be looking for would be ones of a sexual, violent or financial nature. Frankly, nobody would give a shit that you had a minor drugs caution. They would not contact foreign police forces.

This was why I said he maybe oversimplified the situation. I don't really think Dunn grasps that there isn't really a way for Villa to ""act like [a big club]"". At least not all the time, anyway. Not without significant financial risk that could see us slip further and further away from where we all feel we should be, perhaps.

But the idea that Villa are even in this position (primarily because of financial reasons) is kind of upsetting in and of itself. Dunn says as much himself:

&gt; ""It has sadly become a club that knows its place in the cash-rich Premier League… and that place is not in the elite.""

Not one of us can really dispute that, I think. Not right now, anyway. Maybe by 2020 things will be right again, and I'll still be here waiting. But I'm losing that feeling of optimism that I used to have. I used to look at actions being taken and rationalise that it might work out. That's getting harder to do.

You're right that good things are happening. And I'm not trying to be defeatist. I really am trying to see the positives in everything that's happening lately... I just find it hard to believe (considering our limited financial means) that these promising signings we're making now won't be leaving under similar circumstances in two or three years, too. Even Liverpool, supposedly a significantly bigger club than us, with much bigger revenue streams, have been forced to sell their best player two seasons running. Where does that leave us?

* [St. Fagans National History Museum](http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/stfagans/) - a massive, largely open air museum containing dozens of buildings of historical significance that have been transported brick by brick or stone by stone and reconstructed within the confines of the museum. St. Teilo's Church is a paritcular highlight. Also has loads of interior exhibitions on Welsh history. Free entry and it could easily take a full day if not more to see it all. It's in the middle of some [pretty exciting reconstruction projects](http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/stfagans/makinghistory/llys%20_rhosyr_and_bryn_eryr/) at the moment, though I'm not sure when they're slated for completion.
* [The National Museum](http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/cardiff/) &amp; the [Civic Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathays_Park) - the National Museum has some surprisingly good art collections - particularly impressionists like Monet and Turner. Also home to some great geology / natural history exhibitions with a Welsh slant. Entry is once again free. It's housed within an impressive structure in Cardiff's civic centre, which is to my mind one of the finest examples of Edwardian planning and architecture anywhere in the world. Well worth a wander around - upstairs in the City Hall you'll also find a sort of ""hall of heroes"" full of statues of noteworthy Welsh figures.
* [Cardiff Castle](http://www.cardiffcastle.com/) - The history of Cardiff *is* the history of the castle. It's built on the floorplan of the Roman fort, with a Norman keep and a vast Victorian mansion inside. The tour is costly, but worth it - some of the rooms inside the mansion are absolutely spectacular.
* [Castell Coch](http://cadw.gov.wales/daysout/castell-coch/?lang=en), located on the northern edge of Cardiff, is a Victorian fairytale built on the foundations of a real castle. Built by the same architect as the mansion in Cardiff Castle, and it shows. Full of flamboyance and whimsy.
* [Cardiff Bay](http://www.visitcardiffbay.info/) - loads to see down the Bay. The [Senedd](http://www.assembly.wales/en/visiting/senedd/Pages/senedd.aspx), which houses the National Assembly of Wales, is a fantastic building which offers free tours. The [Millennium Centre](http://www.wmc.org.uk/) has you covered if you fancy some theatre. Plus there's loads of places to grab something to eat along the waterfront.
* The Rugby World Cup - you've timed your visit well. England are hosts this year, and Wales has managed to nick a few matches for the Millennium Stadium. Wales vs. Fiji on the 1st of October, New Zealand vs. Georgia on the 2nd, France vs. Ireland on the 11th and two quarter finals on the 17th and 18th. Be sure to soak up the atmosphere in the city centre on match day.

Outside of Cardiff:

* The [Brecon Beacons](http://www.breconbeacons.org/) for hiking and natural beauty. [Pen-y-Fan](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=pen-y-fan&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=993&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMIq4P0zs3nxgIVhloUCh3Zog23), the highest mountain in the range, is an extremely easy walk from the Storey Arms on the main road to Brecon. From there you could choose to walk along the ridge to Cribyn and beyond. [Waterfall Country](http://www.breconbeacons.org/waterfall-country) above Hirwaun is another great area to explore on foot. If walking isn't your thing you could also see something of the national park from the [Brecon Mountain Railway](http://www.breconmountainrailway.co.uk/).
* Castles, castles everywhere. Visit [Caerphilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caerphilly_Castle) for sheer scale. [Carreg Cennen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carreg_Cennen_Castle) for spectacular location. [Dinefwr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinefwr_Castle) for a native Welsh castle. [Raglan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raglan_Castle) for a not-a-real-castle type of castle.
* [Big Pit](http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/bigpit/) if you fancy disappearing down a coal mine for a couple of hours.
* [Dan yr Ogof](http://www.showcaves.co.uk/) if you prefer a more natural subterranean experience.
* [Tredegar House](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/tredegar-house/), [Dyffryn Gardens](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/dyffryn-gardens/) and [Margam Park](http://www.margamcountrypark.co.uk/) to see how the gentry lived.
* The [Glamorgan Heritage Coast](http://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/en/enjoying/visit_the_vale/llantwit_major_and_coast/heritage_coast.aspx) and [the Gower Peninsula](http://www.visitswanseabay.com/destinations/gower-peninsula/) for more walks and some spectacular coastal landscapes.
* [Brecon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brecon) for a handsome country town with plenty of interest in the vicinity. [Hay-on-Wye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hay-on-Wye) for a truly unique place chock full of bookshops. 
* [Caerleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caerleon) and [Caerwent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caerwent) for all things Roman. Caerwent was a Roman *civitas* - the tribal capital of the Silures - and still retains some impressive sections of the town wall. Excavations have also revealed the foundations of some shops and civic structures around the modern centre of the village. Caerleon (which comes from the Welsh for *Fort of the Legion*) is where you'll find the [National Roman Legion Museum](http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/roman/), as well as some pretty extensive remains including an amphitheatre and a baths complex.

I would recommend at least one day in a quieter part of Wales - most of the country is very different to the cramped valleys and coasts of the South-East. The area around Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire is packed with things to do. Carreg Cennen and Dinefwr castles - mentioned above, are nearby, along with Dinefwr House and park (a National Trust property) and the [National Botanic Garden of Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Botanic_Garden_of_Wales). Llandeilo itself is a lovely little town, though there isn't much there, and the Tywi valley in which it is situated is just gorgeous (though perhaps less so on a rainy October afternoon!).

This strikes me as extremely misguided and if the club had acted in that way they would rightfully have been labelled incompetent. 

Firstly, he wouldn't have signed without a release clause, that seems pretty clear, we had no leverage and were in no position to be dictating terms.  Which leaves us with the other two options; to sell him in January, when we would have got less than the £8m we just received, and would most likely have been relegated without him in the team, or to let him leave on a free at the end of the season, probably stay up, but lose out on £8m for what? Pride? Fucking hell!

Like it it or not we aren't a team that can just shit away £8m (or £6m in real terms after sell on fees to Leeds etc) on a point of principle, we simply don't have the money.  Whether or not we have an extra £6m to spend this season on wages/transfer fees could make a real noticeable difference to how things end up.. and given that we finished last season one place above relegation, we don't exactly have a lot of wiggle room here. 

People always like to throw around the term ""big club"" like it means something and include all kinds of irrelevant ephemera in order to bolster their claim to the title but to my mind there is only one thing that matters in today's football when assessing the size of a club. 

Revenue. 

For more money the club brings in, the more money the club can spend, the more power the club has, the bigger the club is. This has obviously been reinforced even more in recent times due to the implementation of financial fair play regulations.

That's it.. nothing else, history, catchment area, stadium size, size of support, none of them mean anything other than what they potentially could add to that one figure, which is the only factor that actually matters when it comes to affecting the rest of the world outside of the club. If you don't have the money to pay competitive wages you don't get a discount because you tell a player that you won 5 league titles in the 1890s, they simply don't give a shit. 

So by this metric are we a ""big club""?.. We are, using the most recently released financial figures (for year ending 31 May 2014) the team with the 9th biggest revenue in England, and thus in practical terms the 9th biggest club in England.  So, while we've obviously been under performing in recent history finishing in the bottom half of the table it's not like we have a divine right to be in Europe either and it's simply not in our best interests to be behaving like we're one of the superclubs to whom money is almost an irrelevance.

Let's be real: CB is where we are strongest. Where we need to find a top level talent is at right wing, and if we're going to spend 40 mil *this* summer, it ought to be spent locking down a winger who can score goals.
Cahill has performed just fine. The pressure he faced mid season seeing Zouma in his slot got him to up his game and he finished strong. Terry was the best CB in England this year. Zouma is our up and comer. *Next* season is when we need to sign a CB, and it needs to be at a time when we can guarantee playing time. We simply can't offer that guarantee to anyone right now because Terry is too good, Cahill deserves his spot, and Zouma is already next in line and is coming on strong.

Buying Stones for 40 mil would simply be spending a massive amount of money on a slot that you won't give game time to, and if you did, would take away from Zouma's development. It's a waste this year at that price.

And after yet another year of shit - and even more vehemence from Loyalists and young ""City of God"" type hoods - something's going to have to give.

However, the Public Order Act has never sat well with me; especially in a Northern Irish context and personally I think people should be allowed to gather and do what they please and act how they please - so long as they're bringing no direct harm to anyone. You'll notice I said ""no direct harm"" - so I mean that where harm/damage is likely or occurs - I am not supportive.

I do however not have any problems with effigy and flag burning. I feel that while distasteful it should never be legislated against because then governments can use such laws to ban further freedoms of expression and that is a slippery slope. That though, does not extend as far as ""crucify taigs"" because that is an outright threat of violence. 

If we're talking about planting bombs and shooting at cops - that's not the same to me - that's going to be an anti-terror operation and will have fuck all to do with the public, politicians, or civil society. M15, the NCA and CID detectives will investigate that. Very different type of operation - and rightly so - it's a completely separate issue. 

Now, I'm not saying that people who drop concrete blocks on people, people shooting 9mm pistols out of the Short Strand, people who throw petrol bombs, rocks, golf balls; people who bring AKs onto the street or shine lasers at cops during riots shouldn't face the full rigours of the law. 

Personally I think the PSNI should be far more aggressive in such situations. If police had shot the OO man who brought that sabre to a riot, or the guy who brought the AK out in north Belfast I would not take issue. 

If they shot a rioter who was chucking a petrol bomb I would also not take issue. That is a clear threat to life and I consider petrol bombs murder weapons. Do I think such aggression would lead to escalation. Certainly. Which is probably why I am not the Chief Super. 

But someone attending a bonfire, erecting a flag, painting a curb stone, shouting and being offensive ought not face the same punishments as those people. They are not simply two sides of the same coin, they are wholly different grades of criminality.

However, the way we campaign in the referendum will impact our perception just like it did in Scotland. I'm not sure the party understands this and thinks that simply having their own campaign will be enough. There needs to be a bit of euroscepticism from the party to get through to those voters and I'm not sure it'll be allowed.

null,false,aenor,null,null,null,"Regarding trade unions - the only people who can rehabilitate them is them. Labour can't do it, because quite properly Lab doesn't control the inner workings of the unions.

The unions flatly refuse to bother with private sector workers any more. They should be signing people up on zero-hours contracts etc, and fighting their cause. But they don't. They are now 100% public sector workers - with the problem that the employers are the state - so it constantly looks like they are fighting with the taxpayer.

Also, doing things like inconveniencing people in a tube strike at the height of summer is not smart. Paris got so fed-up with it's strikes it invested in driverless trains. No drivers, no strikes - but also no jobs.

I don't know why unions don't do imaginative things like raising subs to buy shares in the companies of the places their people work at. Buy sufficient shares and you get a seat on the board, and you can change things from the top of the company...

On immigration, we had that hustings where this poor English guy said how isolated he was at work where everyone spoke Polish and he couldn't participate - and he got told off by Corbyn for being mean and wanting to ban languages, apparently his complaint was infringing *their* rights. His right to be able to be English, go to work in England and have a chat in English was non-existent. Nobody is addressing that some of the people who are guests here are acting in a mean and ill-mannered way to *Brits*.

On the economy - lots of people are better off in this recession because it's deflationary, which means that interest rates have fallen. If you've kept your job and your mortgage payments have dropped sharply due to interest rate cuts, you are better off. So only the fringes of society have had a bad time (they've lost jobs).

Whereas in the early 1990's recession, it was *inflationary* which meant interest rates and mortgage payments *rose*. That meant *everyone* hurt - people in work but with mortgages were feeling pain from higher mortgage payments and people on the fringes lost their jobs. It's easier to make a case for change of govt in that condition.

I suspect Lab will not get traction till interest rates normalise again, and we'll see if the public are really in a resilient place to withstand that. Basically people only hear your message on the economy if they themselves are in pain, and then they are actively looking for something new.

null,false,CleefHanger,null,null,null,"I doubt the concept of ""time"" as a unit of meassure is the same as ours. Time lords probably just life in time rather than count it. Since they travel throught space too, they probably don't need to measure distances at all . 

On the other hand if you picture time as a paper and you bend the paper until two points touch then try to measure the distance in time or centimeters etc between both you will see that you just can't tell, because they are happening in the same time and space. Now if you get the lifespan of the doctor and say ok this point is his future and that one his past and bend the paper, you can see how a timelord sees time. Its all happening for them at the same spot. 

For example: if he is in London in his 1st regeneration in 1980 and his 12th regeneration is in the same time but not the same space, how old are both of his regenerations at that time since they are happening at the same time? Probably the have the same age at that point, right? so if he is in Gallifrey before he was the Doctor, and he is in Trenzalor as he dies for the last time and both ""points"" of his lifespan are happening at the same time in two different ""points"" of history (lets say one in 1980 and the other at 5000 in our local ""time"") since they are happening at the same time in two different points of ""time"" and ""space"", is he older in Trenzalor or younger? 
Wouldn't be easier for time lords to use a different concept of ""time"" or unit of meassure to tell how old they are, like counting the regenerations? 

So if it is that complicated, either the Doctor doesn't bother to keep track or he just uses something else to keep track, like a guide or a dairy or history, to know where or when he is to measure his ""age"", rather than how many times a planet has make a turn around a sun.

And as a traveler he is likely to use the locals concept of time or distance/space just to make it easier to communicate rather than having to explain that is ""wobly timey wyme o'clock"" every time that someone asks him which time is it.

Also the TARDIS has a sun in it so, he probably uses the TARDIS as his ""clock"" or point of reference. Maybe?",null,0,null,1437327147,null,0,1437327788,0,ct8sa9a,null,t3_3dikc5,null,t1_ct8sa9a,null,t3_3dikc5,null,null,null,1437997559,null,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

He came out of fire and was effectively angry and deranged due to it, she come out into rain and was a much calmer and more placid individual while still being enlightened as to the true nature of the regime.

Both saw the bankrupt regime but each saw different merits and methods as to how to end it.  He allows her to blow up parliament at the end because she is the better person in his eyes.  At the end of it all she loves him (i believe) but also hates him, to some degree, because of what he did to her.

I am a great believer though that the prime driver of the success of a club is the manager. Although a club might have to sell their best players season in and season out, the right manager will be able to overcome this.

I fully respect and understand the fact that it is highly unlikely that we will ever challenge for the top honours in the next decade. However, we have the potential to create a team which is capable of challenging for Europe in the next few years. 

The players are out there. Any club with money can buy proven players at a bumper price. It takes a great manager and a good eye for talent to scour the markets and the leagues for those hidden gems. If we have to sell some of these players to 'bigger' clubs further down the line, so be it. It is whether a manager can then use those funds to replace what was lost, or even improve matters, which is the most important aspect. 

Judging from the club's signings so far this season (Richards and Gueye in particular), I am optimistic that we can slowly improve things until we get to a point where we do not have our top talent poached.

If we are to fully utilize Benteke, we have to change our style, just as he needs to improve on certain areas and adapt to our scheme. This isn't a necessarily a bad thing considering how piss poor our offensive was last year. Nor does it mean we'll change everything up and start hoofing the ball. You can't utilize a new dimension without preparing to look for that dimension too.

We're still gonna be a team strong on the ball and looking to pass rather than hoof. We're probably gonna seek to be a little stronger possession wise, which has nothing to do with Benteke but rather Rodgers' philosophy. We will probably still be a very direct and fast paced team, but i'd imagine that with Benteke and the ability to find him in the box when opponents are deep, that we'll be more inclined to wait a couple of touches and pass it around instead of taking an OK shot, but not a good one. Simply because we can always find a similar OK chance by closing our eyes and crossing it in for Benteke who is an absolute monster and can bully pretty much any defender in the world.

With Benteke coming, I think we'll see us attack wider at times, than what we were used to, simply because where we were previously 1 dimensional in that front(because we had zero players to find on the cross), we now have the option to find players like Hendo, Firmino, Coutinho either deep or at the edge of the box AND to search for Benteke on a cross. Again, we won't change into United that game against Fulham where they crossed it 8000 times, but we were dead last in crossed in 14/15, that will change this year. Pretending that nothing will change with Benteke coming is foolish, just like saying we're now Stoke under Pulis. Neither is true. 

Obviously Pedro can cross the ball, he is a brilliant player. However he is more of a striker than a winger, just like Neymar. He'll be far better if he can get into the box and shoot himself or pass it our and wait for another opportunity. We have Coutinho and Firmino for that, not to mention Lallana, Milner and even Hendo. Hell, Studge player the outside forward at times when we had Suarez. Much of Pedros abilities on the ball as a dribbler and especially as a passer would go wasted. We cannot afford not to get 110% payback from our signings. Pedro is a brilliant player, had we gone for a player like Bacca or ideally Lacazette, Pedro would be an ideal player with Clyne providing enough width.

But we'd be lying if we were pretending that men and women aren't different in many regards. No one on the whole cares about what men are wearing, women on the other hand, kind of do. There's entire OOTD blogs centred on that (outfit of the day, I'm hip) and fashion industries built out of that. To call an interest in woman's fashion misogyny is stupid, it's just a difference in sexes, people should stop acting as if what men do is the standard to live by and accept that there's different interests in the two sexes.

Now does it pertain in any way to her political career, God no. Should it even have come up, no. But again they were profiling her personal life, so it doesn't exactly seem out of the ordinary that they'd discuss her fashion sense when you consider just how many women take interest in that. It'd be like asking a male politician his favourite football team when profiling his personal life, would you write that off as sexist?

The reason she had to discuss it in the first place, is the thing that should be attacked for sexism. She's known as an unmarried politician with no children and people had been taking jibes at that, and this was the first interview apparently that she'd spoken openly about her personal life, to address her relationship status being brought up. That's where the sexism lay.

She talked about her personal life in a ""Hey, I'm normal and happy despite being single"" sort of way, and so talked about relationships, how she kept fit and the brands she shopped at. Once she mentioned that she shopped at similar brands to Kate Middleton, he then asked if they were the same size. This is where she drew the line apparently.

Look, no-one but no-one thinks you're terrible because you're white, or a man, or for any reason. Let me try to re-explain what that seminar was presumably trying to tell you. 

One reason is this. It's an experimental fact that almost all people who live in societies such as ours have implicit bias against groups such as black people and women. There are many factors causing this to be the case. There are websites where you can do implicit association tests on yourself to check this. I have been involved with anti-racism activism but I do very poorly on the implicit racism one. And the point isn't that I should feel ashamed of myself (because I didn't choose the conditions I grew up in). The point is, to be *aware*, to double check with yourself, ""am I holding this negative opinion of this person for purely rational reasons, or am I unduly influenced by unsavoury unconscious biases?"" Everyone has unconscious biases, the point isn't to commit seppuku, the point is to make sure you take it into account. 

Another reason is that, partially because of the previous reason, people like me: white, male etc, get an easier ride. People respect me and assume I know what I'm talking about at work. Other groups like black people, women etc. don't get that so much, they get grilled harder in talks etc., they get treated like they're permanently on probation and having to prove that they break the negative stereotypes. The point isn't that I should quit and go hang myself, the point is that I should be *aware* of the way people treat members of these groups unfairly without realizing it, and next time I'm in a situation where I might be putting a junior female colleague through her paces, I can check with myself that I'm not being extra harsh or unwelcoming, so I can avoid reproducing these harmful and irrational behaviours.

It's not about **you**, it's not about passing judgement and making you feel ashamed. It's saying: everyone has irrational cognitive biases which hurt their decision making. Here are some common cognitive biases which are particularly harmful in this context, this is how you can avoid them. It's eminently legitimate and valuable.",null,0,null,1437329760,null,0,false,0,ct8tno8,null,t3_3dtw86,null,t1_ct8tno8,null,t1_ct8ozlr,null,null,null,1437998678,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

http://www.pornhub.com/insights/2014-year-in-review

Heres the current situation in the UK (From my perspective):

Its perfectly acceptable for a young guy to watch porn- by this I mean you can talk to your friends about what categories you normally watch, favourite porn-stars e.t.c (Fetish's are still a taboo to talk about, and that's why they are fetish's, you don't want people to know that you are into anal fisting e.t.c)

However, in terms of girls, its normally seen as a taboo, they don't like speaking about it too much and are a lot less likely to answer the question- ""Do you watch porn?"". There are reasons for this; one is the social stigma of it, which I feel comes from other girls. The whole judging society created (by girls themselves) in the 10-21 age bracket is what hurts  the discussion of stuff like porn the most in girls.

So how do we tackle this?

One, stop saying its bad to watch porn, its not. Its perfectly fine (in moderation of course)

Two, create a sexual education curriculum that actually talks about not only sex but the whole aspect of relationships, body image, fetish's e.t.c

Three- Our societies current fixation on celebrities- PEOPLE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, STOP HERO WORSHIPPING PEOPLE LIKE KIM KARDASHIAN OR OTHER CELEBRITIES (AND TALENTLESS HACKS). Their entire image is fake, its all airbrushed and countless sessions at the gym which are normally quite unhealthy.

A nice quote from Tyrion that should really [make some rounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6aQBWMN7UE) when dealing with body image e.t.c.

Four: Lets not blame one gender or another (since this pieces likes to view men in a bad light). The only way we can tackle issues is by working together, no matter who you are. Once we start discussions on what its like to be and man, and be a women, we can start to create an understanding between the sex's and by doing this, we can work to tackle issues. If we just say ""Well you are a man and you won't understand and vice-versa"" we will keep going round in circles.

What is used to smear me is the fact that I quoted from Abdullah Azzam’s son in a reference to the Iraq war and the resistance to the Allied attack against Saddam Hussein. He said: ""If I saw an American or British man wearing a soldier's uniform inside Iraq I would kill him because that is my obligation. If I found the same soldier over the border in Jordan I wouldn't touch him. In Iraq he is a fighter and an occupier, here he is not. This is my religion and I respect this as the main instruction in my religion for jihad."" The Irish Times 


&gt;Compare this his original statement as found in the Irish Times to what Andrew Gilligan writes ""If I saw an American or British man wearing a soldier's uniform inside Iraq, I would kill him because that is my obligation ... I respect this as the main instruction in my religion for jihad.""


&gt;He completely misrepresents the statement and the point I was making in my article about war, the concept of the ‘theatre of war’ and combatants and non-combatants. I was making no such claims to the legitimate targeting of British soldiers. Nor was I defending, in citing from Abdullah Azzam’s son’s comments, the killing of British troops in Iraq. Again, this is another tedious act of smearing by association, in this case by quoting someone without a disclaimer but perhaps Mary Fitzgerald, who wrote the article for the Irish Times, is saved from having to offer such a disclaimer because she isn’t a Muslim?

I don’t know why he said those silly things, but the way his remarks have been taken up implies that women in science are having a horrible time. That is not the case. I, for one, am having a wonderful time.”

So apparently he's not a sexist, but these people who would speak out for him are ignored, because sexist joke.

&gt;So a beginning researcher is supposed to just ignore the opinions of senior academics holding multiple positions of power and influence? Even if they do, how can they have any confidence that their work will be assessed fairly?

&gt;disclosed how Jon Day, the Ministry of Defence’s director general for security policy, “promised that the UK had 'put measures in place to protect your [the US] interests’” during the inquiry. 

[and from 2013](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-us-blocks-publication-of-chilcots-report-on-how-britain-went-to-war-with-iraq-8937772.html)

&gt;One high-placed diplomatic source said: “The US are highly possessive when documents relate to the presence of the President or anyone close to him. Tony Blair is involved in a dialogue in many of these documents, *and naturally someone else is at the other end – the President. Therefore this is not Tony Blair’s or the UK Government’s property to disclose*.”

&gt;The source was adamant that “Chilcot, or anyone in London, does not decide what documents relating to a US President are published”.

As the US is the main player, a lot of relevant communications will involve them somehow.

I mean take mental health within the NHS for instance: one of the main problems it's facing right now is that it's so centralised that local services and departments find it very difficult to give the level of care that patients need. So I guess a sort of 'decentralised monopoly' is what I might advocate.

You mention education is best run by the government, but I think that depends what you mean by 'the government.' I honestly have no problem with private schools personally, and I see no problem with people choosing to send their children there and letting those schools have a degree of autonomy - but I think state schools are best run by *local* government. So government, yes, but local, responsible to a board partially composed of residents (parents), teachers, and government representatives would be ideal.  In the same sense that I think boards of directors in companies should have representation by individuals nominated democratically by the workers, the point of both of these measures would be to balance competing interests in the interests of compromise and representation of varying, competing interests. This is a system employed with great success in Germany and across Scandinavia.

The most ancient recording referring to the British is from the ""De Bello Gallico"" - Caesar's memoirs. 55 B.C. - *""All the Britons paint themselves with woad, which produces a dark blue color; and for this reason they are much more frightful in appearance in battle. They permit their hair to grow long, shaving all parts of the body except the head and the upper lip.""*

""Welshmen do not yield"" - Frankly you should be gravely disappointed you don't know about this, Since you're going around here yelling about how Welsh you are and definitely not British. 

It's the famous old bard's tale, turned into anthem, talking about the Siege of Harlech. The Welshmen completely outnumbered stood strong and held Harlech for 8 years against the English. The longest lasting siege in British history. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRtnWVvDX6k


&gt; And as for the 'anti-English' sentiment, I think you are seeing what you want to see.

Don't talk through what you sit on, You know exactly what you've been saying about ""British"" being some sort of horrible term invented by the English that doesn't apply to Wales.

I've provided you sources that are all verifiable. Now as Mr.Scholar, do you have any other questions? ;)

You see, to me it's a crowd behaviour thing.  Most people join in the crowd because we're interested in finding out about the incident, but when even a small proportion of people decides that retribution is in order they can really easily drag the crowd along with them -- with most members of the crowd not really realising what is going on or necessarily endorsing everything that is happening.  And each person is happy with where we ourselves are and what we ourselves are doing, because, as you say, we're:

&gt; interested in improving the general quality of the society we live in.

But I'm not sure if trial-by-social-media is a good thing, I'm afraid.  Large bodies of well-intentioned people are, it seems, incredibly bad at behaving in a rational way.  The ever-ongoing #GamerGate, um, THING, is a really good example of that.  I can see that there are actually large numbers of good people trying to voice genuine concerns on all sides of #GamerGate, and an equal massive failure in communication, understanding and empathy.

In all likelihood we will still play a possession based game with the fluid movement that's been a trademark for BR's Liverpool (when the team is clicking and in sync). 

I think our football is going to have many more dimensions this season that will make it much more difficult for opposing teams to neutralize our attack. We won't have to watch a front three of Coutinho, Sterling, and Lallana get pushed around as they try to weave between the opposition's physically imposing back line. Benteke and Origi give the team strength with movement that allows for the quick one-two passes that have been so effective at getting through on goal. I am fairly certain Rodgers won't be telling our AMs and wingers to just swing in crosses to Benteke all day. Sure, it helps that we could go all FIFA and spam crosses, but that neglects the technical abilities of our ""wonderful technicians."" Defenders will have to respect the cross, but players like Coutinho and Ibe are just as happy to take on their defender and play a decisive ball on the floor for a runner to latch on to and one-touch pass the keeper.

I think this really depends what you're interested in- everyone has their own experience of Cambridge. I suppose the Cambridge 'things' are the colleges with all their architecture, the rowing, and the punting. If I could name a favourite Cambridge experience it would be canoeing up to Grantchester on a hot day.  There's also some decent museums and stuff, but really I'd advise you to do what you want to. You'll undoubtedly meet people once you start your MPhil who will recommend you things to do. You're not a tourist- there's no need to come in with an itinerary of things you feel like you have to experience. For some people the 'full experience' is purely academic, for others it's more to do with the social life or the historic atmosphere. 

&gt;    I wish to get involved in the film industry after finishing the MPhil. Would the Career center be the stepping stone? What were your experiences with it?

Will defer this one to someone else, since I personally didn't use the career centre much. But I think the best way to find out that sort of thing is to straight up email them- it's what they're there for, after all.

I've been a fairly serious FIFA player for about four years or so, and that is due to the ultimate team feature. It's almost the only game mode I play so I invest a lot of time into it. One cool feature is being able to track your cards from year-to-year, and I've done so with Spurs. I've created close to the best team possible (the best if I exclude FIFA 11). I think it's fun to look at the turnover from the years, and figured you might as well.

Edit: Just realized that Robbie Keane and Dos Santos' IF cards in FIFA 11 were actually with West Ham &amp; Racing Santander,  not Spurs, my bad!

Going into teaching with the plan to leave in a couple of years once you've got your bursary contributes this. It is also money that could have otherwise gone into other funds for education.

I think the issue comes down to how long you would plan to teach for? Five years would be reasonable. Honestly, my advice would be don't go into teaching unless you have a genuine passion and interest in it, because the chances are you won't last.

null,false,dastrn,null,null,null,"Terry just put in arguably his best season to date. Cahill was one of the best CBs of the league, and only had a few rough moments. Every other CB in the league had bigger mistakes than Cahill did. The only reason we noticed when he did is because we are so spoiled by having easily the best back 4 in England (maybe the world). Cahill is NOT fading. He's fantastic and had a great season. Zouma is more than ""good with great potential."" That kid will be world class and will be our defensive core for the next decade barring major injury. He and Courtois are the new Chelsea D core, and we will build the rest of our D around those 2 players' strengths and weaknesses.

Where else on the pitch do you think we have better strength as a unit? Costa is great but he is the least reliable player on the squad because of that hamstring. Hazard is obviously ridiculous but since Azpilicueta isn't given the freedom to make overlap runs like Ivanovic, and Oscar has been spotty due to injury as well, Hazard's means of distribution and likely targets have constantly changed.
On right wing this year, we tried Schurrle, Ramirez, William, Salah, and Cuadrado, and honestly I think we sold our best player for the job to Wolfsburg. We have no stability there either.

So, yes I'd argue vehemently that if there is one place that we are locked in as solid, it's defense. Our backup right back is our starting left back. We're looking to potentially sell our back up left back, and our other options (Christensen, etc.) haven't been terribly impressive yet. Sooo, I would argue that if we have not only solid starters, but depth in any position on the pitch, it'd be at CB.

null,false,sjampen,lfc99,,null,"Firstly, I agree with the last part, especially with the Barca+Bayern thing. The main point was that we'll cross the ball more and feed Benteke in a different way than we previously did, because he is a different player. Its fairly normal when buying a different player. Pedro would be a good player, but not a perfect fit. With money already spent, we can't really afford that AND convince a winner from Barca to join us at our salary abilities. 

I do however disagree with Bentekes technical capabilities. By no means is he not a good technical player with some abilities on the ball, but Liverpool requires more than just capable and adequate when it comes to passing and being on the ball, whether thats driving with it or holding possession. Its not even about his general technical ability, but purely about his ability to join the passing game. 

Benteke does hold possession very well, but with the ball at his feet he is very one dimensional and just powers through opponents when driving. That certainly has its moments, but not always. The drive with he ball is something i'm confident Benteke will develop. Its the next logical step for him to develop the ability to drive better with the ball. 

The passing i'm more worried about. Benteke is not a good passer. Sure, he can do it, he is a professional footballer, but not at the level required in Liverpool. He lacks the vision and the intuition for the passing game, and quite frankly lacks the technical ability to enter into combinations in the same way Sturridge can or Luis Suarez mastered. We saw in Andy Carroll how detrimental that was. Benteke is better on the ball, but he will slow down Coutinho, Firmino, Lallana, Milner and Hendo. Can he develop at that? Sure, but he is not a natural, and it will be a tall order to get at a level we require. Which isn't a bad thing, Chelsea never asked Drogba to do it as much as we did, nor Diego Costa. I'm fairly certain than Bayern didnt require as much from neither Mario Gomez or Mandzukic, but they did bring in Lewandowski who excels at joining the build up play. 

Watch Zlatan play for Malmö and the beginning of his AJAX career. It wasn't Zlatan like we know now and he was a big striker, but you could see the natural flair and abilities on the ball and as a passer.  Thats not Benteke, far from it. OK, thats Zlatan Ibrahimovic an unfair comparison, but its not like its any close. Benteke isn't even at the level Lewandowski was when he broke through for Dortmund.

It is simply there in the political history that National Socialism was an idea that was received favourably enough by electorates to spawn legitimate political parties and populist movements in both the UK and the USA. 

German American Bund and its predecessors Free Teutonia / FONG were founded at a time when the ideas behind NS were on the rise internationally - and the British Union of Fascists (which was apparently [supported early on](http://www.voiceoftheturtle.org/dictionary/dict_h1.php#hurrah) by the Daily Mail) was also very much on the political map.

 In the context of the Great Depression, having a government that could radically and speedily reverse the trend in unemployment AND get rid of historical injustice a la Treaty of Versailles was a miracle. After the moribund Weimar years and horror of hyperinflation only ten years past, here was a movement that could actually get things *done*.

In spite of the rumours of early horrors and injustices and disenfranchisement no wonder there were outbreaks of supporting behaviour. Even after the trend became clear, you could still find pockets of antisemitism.

And bear in mind that to the voter on the street back then, sources of information were in very short supply. Short clips like [these](http://www.britishpathe.com/video/opening-of-anti-semitic-campaign-in-germany) were practically all they had to go on for real live proof of what was happening.

He lost a lot of credibility and never really regained it.

Corbyn - from what I've seen of him - has that conviction. He's more statesmanlike too, even if a lot of this is down to his age and history in politics. His political views mean he's more susceptible to smear campaigns - the Tories have spent the last five years discrediting left-wing politics, and Labour under Miliband made no effort to fight back - which could hurt his chances.

As the other poster said, HCA is likely the role you'll be looking at, either in the community or in a hospital.  My experience is all hospital or outpatient based, none in community.  HCAs aren't legally allowed to administer medication.  However, there are situations where (in a community setting) the meds have already been dispensed in a dosset box, the patient is able to take them him/herself and an HCA would be allowed to take the tablets from the dosset box (ie: if the PT has manual dexterity issues) and give them to the PT to take.  Also, an HCA would be allowed to assist the patient to take meds that has been dosed out by a nurse, along with eating and drinking assistance.

There's been an ongoing trend in healthcare to pass more and more tasks over to HCAs, some can be quite clinical.  At the moment there's no professional body or regulated training to be an HCA.

We will continue wasting 15-20 million pounds year after year on players like Lovren, Moreno and Clyne but until we buy a proper DM we will continue to look like mugs for paying too much for a players that continue letting in goals the few times they get caught out of position and have no cover to bail them out.

In my mind, his main skills are set pieces and last ditch tackles (normally coming from a mistake he has made) meanwhile Mamadou Sakho i'm always confident in, he can makes good tackles, great passer and whilst he may not look it, he's very confident on the ball.

Also for a player to be so young and already have that experience is such a massive help into going into the future of the club, how many people can say they've captained a World Cup winning nation and one of the biggest clubs in PSG by 25 years old.

Mamadou Sakho is a player I personally want in my starting lineup, whilst Martin Skrtel is the guy who if the other options wasn't Dejan Lovren or Kolo Toure (despite how much I like him) he'd be the backup on the bench who could pull a good shift in when needed but you don't want starting.

I'm not saying I want Sakho as vice captain, personally I want Lucas as I'm confident with him and he's been through it all at this club.

**Original Post:**          
I built this PC a few months ago for a small project, which I never ended up making progress on. As a result it's been kept hidden away and only used a couple of times, it's condition is essentially brand new and mint condition, with everything functioning perfectly. It holds a very impressive form factor as you can see in the image comparison with a Sony PlayStation 4. 

Specifications: 
-Intel Core i3 4330 Dual Core Hyper Threaded (4 Threads like a Quad Core CPU) at 3.50GHz with 4MB Cache and an Intel HD Graphics 4600 GPU 
-Corsair Vengeance LP 1600MHz RAM 4GB (2x2GB) 
-Asus H81I-PLUS Mini-ITX Motherboard 
-Kingston 60GB SSD (Solid State Drive, much much faster than a regular hard drive) 
-PowerCool T01B Slim Mini-ITX case with 300W PSU integrated 

(Side Note):To my surprise it ran Dolphin Emulator (Wii and Gamecube) and PCSX2 emulator (PlayStation 2) at full speed on all games at above native resolutions!

Most of the criticism came from the left which was upset about the use of the private sector contracts in such an unfettered way -NOT the mainstream politcal elite and the right wing press.

No, PFIs were, and to a degree still are fine. Labour misused them in not all but many instances and were criticised at the time for doing so. Gordon Brown was accused of considering them like some kind of religion. If in doubt, PFI! You're still mixing up the fact that whilst some PFIs are fine, not all are. Just because the concept was considered sound in the past, it doesn't mean that all PFIs were considered OK at the time.

&gt; No your point was Labour carried out actions that were irresponsible because it's what Labour do.

You're kind of putting words in my mouth. I'm am not a die hard supporter of any party. I have voted for four different parties in the past depending on the issues at the time and the election in question. 

Let me start from the beginning because perhaps I wasn't clear. The post to which I was responding initially said Labour didn't spend as much as people say. This is wrong. Labour spent far more than the base line debt and deficit figures would suggest because a lot of the debt was hidden off balance sheet. Whether this was a good thing, a bad thing, part of the orthodoxy or otherwise, the fact of the matter is the money was spent and it can't be ignored when calculating how much the Labour government spent.

Let say you are correct and it was part of the orthodoxy (although I still refute that. Criticism of the shadiness of PFI's goes back to the very early 90's. Alister Darling, of all people, criticised them in parliament for created a huge hidden liability. That was around '92 or '93 if I recall.) but let's say they were part of the orthodoxy and no one was the wiser. They STILL count as a liability.

Do you remember how City played when they won the title? That 4-4-2 with Yaya and Fernandinho in midfield. I don't think necessarily NEED a defensive mid, but 2 midfielders holding the line knowing what their respective jobs are would work fine. Although Fernandinho wouldn't burst forward all that much, he would still make good tackles and get the ball moving. Yaya Toure would be the one who would burst forward. I think the midfielders we have at the club are capable of pulling that kind of chemistry off (assuming we're playing 2 at the top).

However defensive mid is a different story. I don't like Allen as a defensive mid, I think he's better in the middle where he's free to roam and put pressure on other players. Lucas is the only player who really only plays there and he does his job perfectly. Players like him do not come along often and when they do they are normally pretty expensive. I like having a defensive midfielder, and although I don't think that position is needed to be effective, with a defensive as erratic as ours I DO believe we need a player to sit infront of our defense. I don't rate Skrtel as highly as everyone else on this sub seems to, Sakho is going to come out as the best CB in the premier league come the end of this season and I think Lovren/Illori will be partnering him. However, with the state of our current CB's, I still believe a DM is needed, for now anyways.

Yes,  I think that's right. It's unfortunate, but it's clear to me that if he's lost the discretion to know what's appropriate to say in public then it's entirely justified for institutes and research councils to decide that they no longer want to be associated with him in a public capacity. 

&gt;Because he also expressed the opinion that women can and do do good in science. It's just that the negative part (which wasn't even serious) got more focus.

The Today programme recording clouded the issue somewhat - if he'd said then it was a joke in poor taste he'd have been fine, but instead he attempted to justify it.  The latter opinion is what everyone is expected to think, so of course it didn't get attention.

It's unfortunate, but it's clear to me that if he's lost the discretion to know what's appropriate to say in public then it's entirely justified for institutes and research councils to decide that they no longer want to be associated with him in a public capacity.

Why? Why do people have to adhere to such discretion? Why can't we have jokes in our talks? It is [political correctness](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1341459-political-correctness-is-america-s-newest-form-of-intolerance-and-it) gone mad!

If people didn't make such a big deal out of it, his superiors wouldn't have cared. It's a contrived political issue. Let's not forget that right afterwards he went on to praise women in science. He was *balanced*, and *fair*, he was not trying to push some kind of agenda; but with the reaction, you'd think he was. With the reaction, you'd think he'd gone on a rant about how women are all terrible and useless at science, or worse: actually hit a woman. That's what it takes to lose a job, in my eyes. Look at what it took to get Jeremy Clarkson fired.

&gt;The latter opinion is what everyone is expected to think, so of course it didn't get attention.

This isn't okay though. This lines up exactly with the article I linked in the last comment. *""the regime compels its subjects not only to obey but to believe.""*

&gt;Those with unpopular opinions might lose their jobs but they can find others

Not really. For a lot of people, their job *is* their livelihood. It is tough. When you go for someone's bottom line based on their political views... that is overstepping.

Here is what Tim has said about his lost vocation:

&gt;“I am finished,” he says. “I had hoped to do a lot more to help promote science in this country and in Europe, but I cannot see how that can happen. I have become toxic. I have been hung to dry by academic institutes who have not even bothered to ask me for my side of affairs.”

I read this and I just think: this is a travesty. Not only has he lost something, but the world has. All because he dared criticise women; even in jest.

&gt;And Hunt ultimately claimed not to hold the opinions he was fired for - which means that his firing was not punishment, but rather the unfortunate result of his own incompetence at PR.

You seem to assume they care about the distinction. As I said earlier, the only reason it's a PR problem is because fanatics blow it up into being one. It is a contrived, non-issue, that only stands out due to the ridiculous social climate we find ourselves in.

If we consider how many kits would have to be sold to match that, that's going to be 50,000,000 / 50 = 1,000,000 kits... Which is just ridiculous.

In other words, no, new fans aren't a reliable source of revenue for the club (probably). But the amount of new fans does represent the strength of the club globally and commercially, so yes, they are still important.

If you want to be working in the hospital labs, diagnosing and investigating on patient samples then you're looking for a career as a biomedical scientist.
This is what I am, except I work in biochemistry. 
Upon graduation you will need to find an employer that will train you in the HCPC registration portfolio, as you can't work without this. These jobs are very hard to come by, I've been out of uni two years and I've just found a job with someone who can train me, to start next month.

- I think Traore can slot into all AM positions, but I included him only on the 10, as IMO that's most likely where he'll get minutes. But it's hard to predict that one.

- In addition, I know Traore played as a striker in Vitesse, and did an awesome job, but - in terms of physicality - Eredivisie and BPL are total contrasts, so I strongly believe he wont be able to play the no. 9 in a one-striker system.

- Ramires is not an ideal suit in the pivot, as we all know. I put him there, though, as we can go 4-3-3 with him as the no. 8.

- As can be seen, we are pretty ok in terms of midfield and attack. We could argue about the quality of the depth, but it is what it is, and with Mourinho's comments being made, we should get used to it. The problem is in defence - we have awesome versatility due to Brana and Azpi, but if one of them (let alone both) gets injured, we're proper screwed. So it makes sense that we're looking for one more defender, as per Jose's comments.

What are your thoughts on the depth of our team? I think it's decent, but we are VERY reliant on luck/our medical department. If we have a shitty spell of injuries, I'm not very confident we'll be able to cope, let alone on multiple fronts. Having said that, I'm very excited to incorporate Bertrand Traore and Ruben Loftus-Cheek into our first team, and if this means sacrificing a little bit in the 'exciting transfers' department, then so be it.

**TL;DR** - Our first 11 is absolutely awesome. Our depth is decent, not much more than that, so we'll have to rely on our medical department being awesome yet again. Having said that, the depth is better than it was in the previous season.

The relevant definition of conservative is:

&gt;averse to change or innovation and holding traditional values. (adj)

|

&gt;a person who is averse to change and holds traditional values. (noun)

If one ignores bits of Qur'an then by definition one is not conservative because one has changed the religion. The one does not hold traditional values any more.

Within 2 days the park is fucking trashed. Tire marks all in the turf, a grand piano(!!!) smashed apart on the field, rubbish, dog shit, human shit. The showers and toilets were smashed up.
