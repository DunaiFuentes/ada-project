At most, about as much as your lab, definitely not more. But GSMD are bigger dogs too, so there's a lot more surface area for fur to grow. Just make sure they have a good diet and they should do great. Also just a heads up. My swissy liked to eat really fast, and since she was eating dry food, it would upset her stomach and then she'd puke it all over. If you get a swissy and she eats too fast, add hot water to the bowl. It will soften the food and make it easier on your dog. Just to follow up on all of this. I highly recommend gsmd.
