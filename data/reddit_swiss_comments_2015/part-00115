I can advice to visit the Buddhist monastery situated on Mont-Pèlerin above Vevey. It's an Institute for Higher Tibetan studies as well as an authentic Tibetan-Buddhist monastery with about thirty monks and five nuns and twenty lay students. They have guest rooms and dormitories. You can eat there if you announce your coming a few hours before.

You can also pray there and study buddhism (7 years-long curriculum) or simply book yourself into one of the few guided tours/debates, then you will eat with the monks and it's funny to eat while debating religions. The price of the meals weren't set and we were just told to give as much money as we wished.

In the early 1970s, at the Dalai Lama's request, Geshe Tamdrin Rabten started training Westerners in Switzerland to become teachers and built this monastery above Vevey. It's a very famous one. I can also advice to visit Rikon monastery and to give a try to the various Tibetan restaurants around it. 


**Chinese food**

It's not my region as I live in Vaud, but I think I have to advice this restaurant situated in ... Germany. Ok don't worry, it's just on the other side of Bodensee in Lindau.

China-Restaurant Kanton In der Grub 32 88131 Lindau

I ate in it during business travel and it was absolutely delicious. The restaurant ambiance was a mix of Chinese-Bayern style. The dishes were huge and well served, more importantly on time. It was also owned by a Chinese family from Guangzhou. I need to go back there.

I stop to write otherwise I will begin to write about the Eight Major Regional Cuisines and other cultural stuff, nobody will like as it's complicated. I am annoyed when people eat in a ""Chinese"" restaurant in Switzerland and are served dishes from other countries or not cooked in the chinese ways. Unfortunately most customers don't know the differences. I am not Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan, Russian, Polish or Indochinese, but I am a purist for those cuisines.

&gt; [It’s a heresy now (good luck convincing your boss of what I’m about to say), but every hour you work over 40 hours a week is making you less effective and productive over both the short and the long haul. And it may sound weird, but it’s true: the single easiest, fastest thing your company can do to boost its output and profits -- starting right now, today -- is to get everybody off the 55-hour-a-week treadmill, and back onto a 40-hour footing.](http://www.alternet.org/story/154518/why_we_have_to_go_back_to_a_40-hour_work_week_to_keep_our_sanity)

I don't know if anybody has been brave enough to reduce their employees to a 30 hour work week, but there's pretty convincing evidence that productivity drops so quickly after about 50 hours that additional hours become effectively negative productivity.  Some studies say above 40 hours is pointless.
