Which makes as much sense as changing things because they're old.

You're right. Saying that something should be changed because we haven't adapted it for a while is not a good enough reason to change something.

*However* the argument that something doesn't need change because it's been a thing for a very long time is equally useless.

We have to examine things just *a bit* more throughly and weigh other arguments as well. Things like the people's happiness. Possible consequences of change vs no change. Economic factors and moral factors. Looking at other countries who did similar things.

Honestly when doing this examination I cannot really see any negative points and the positives are just tipping the scale overwhelmingly towards equality.

So if your only argument is that we should not change it because we haven't changed it for several thousands of years (which is probably not true, minor changes have happened all the time), then you don't have to wonder why you're losing the discourse.",null,0,null,1435485465,null,0,false,0,cslark4,null,t3_3bakq9,null,t1_cslark4,null,t1_csl1udy,null,null,null,1437410174,null,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2,null

Very rich country, one of the highest standards of living in the world. If I remember correctly it's considered by research to be the best place to be born, best place for expats, and the happiest nation in the world, as well as many other great things. Very beautiful country and high in tourism. We have lots of lakes and mountains, and for a relatively small country, the weather and climate is fairly different in different regions of the country. The two major cities are Geneva and Zurich, and then we have big cities like Bern, Basel, Lausanne, Lugano etc... We have 4 national languages, Swiss German, French, Italian, Romansch. We have 26 cantons, which are similar to states in the US. We have a strong democracy where swiss people can vote often. We are surrounded by Italy, France, Germany, Liechtenstein, and Austria, the biggest border is Italy to the south. We don't have the sea, but driving to it isn't that far, and we are centrally located in Europe, and the world really, which is good for travel. We voted not to be in the European Union, so we have our own currency, not the Euro, and a few other things. We are neutral, so we don't take parts in wars or conflicts, but all Swiss men must do army training for a few months (not you don't worry). People are pretty humble and shy sometimes, but it depends on where you are in the country. 

I don't know where in Switzerland you'll be, so that changes some things. Usually it's considered that the french speaking side (Geneva for example) is more liberal, and more international (Geneva has the UN, ILO, Red Cross, WHO, WTO, etc etc etc), and some very very top universities and schools. Culture changes depending on where you are. If you're from Argentina, you'd probably fit in better in the french or italian regions, than the german regions.

The food is good, but fairly simple. We're very famous for Chocolate (Toblerone, Lindt, etc.) and Cheese (Fondue, Gruyere, Raclette etc.). Again, it's a very international place, so you'll find whatever you want. For example there's an Argentinian Steak place 15 minutes from my house. I guess as an Argentinian you like Yerba Mate, which can be found in some tea stores, and especially online.

It's more that striking up a conversation with random strangers is rather unusual and maby looked at as odd. I don't think that people are averse to it, just not used to it. Normally if some random guy starts talking to you here, they ask for directions or help with something. So if you just start chatting people up, they'll expect you to want help with something and if that question doesn't come, they'll wonder why you're talking to them and when the pleasantries will end and you'll finally get to the point and ask your question.

I'd say its cultural differences. I've nice anecdote for that from a friend of mine. He and some buddies went to the US and in a restaurant some people from the table across asked them where they were from. They answered the question and continued with their meal. The Americans got upset and thought they were being impolite. They (the US people) apparently were trying to start a conversation and expecting my friend and buddies to continue talking. My friend thought they were simply asking a question and all that was expexted was a simple answer.

It seems Argentinian immigrants need a ""Bachiller"" with an average of 7/10 as well as passing the ECUS exams, which is a swiss exam for people with foreign degrees applying for university here. Tuition at uni ge is 500 CHF per semester (500CHF is more or less 500USD).

If by college you mean ""mittelschule"" (pre university level; ""Bachiller"" in your language i think), this differs from canton to canton. They generally require an admission exam. I don't know if they have a special process for immigrants but i doubt it. Meaning you'd probably have to take the exam like everyone else. Tuition here is paid by the state since they are public schools.

There are of course other, private, institutions but they are very expensive.

Taking care or the child you gave birth is the duty. You cannot have one without the other.

But since everybody cannot give birth (because some women and all men cannot), and since some child have lost their parent or have been abandoned, the adoption came as a compromise for both party.

Ah, well, I guess I don't know if that's good, either. I just assumed it might be, since I figure you are one, although I guess you probably don't have much in common with Mexicans (for example) other than language. I don't know, perhaps you can find a sense of kinship with other Latin Americans, but I don't know you or Argentina so perhaps I'm way off the mark!

It's interesting to me that you found Germany foreboding to the point of being worried about doing something you houldn't. The laws in Germany are probably not very different from Argentina, I'd think you'd have to try to do something wrong, rather than do something wrong inadvertently.
