(1)

* low taxes for companies

* allowing tax competition between communes and cantons

* sane IP regulation (strict patent system, no software patents, letting patents expire relatively quickly, see Nespresso)

* sane industry regulations. E.g. you can do things like selling raw milk cheese if declared properly, selling cucumbers that aren't straight (looking at you, EU), selling unlabeled products at the farmer's market, selling generic medicine.

(2)

* regulations for renting property - quitting a contract needs 3 month notice on both sides. 

* regulations in favour of employees - mandatory vacation, maternal leave, protection when becoming sick &amp; needing to do military service - but generally more liberal than France/Germany where firing someone can become almost impossible -&gt; allows the job markets to flow more freely.

So, having a truly 'liberal' system doesn't just mean to be friendly to companies - regulations should generally be as few as possible, but if regulating *anything* it needs to be protecting the weaker party in a transaction and it should if possible not shut down the market and hand the keys to an oligopoly (see IP law in the US, pharmaceutical industry in the US, telecommunication industry in the US). Switzerland is doing pretty well there - although that could be just a factor of scale, since it's just a better return on investment for companies like Novartis to let the lobbying millions flow in the US rather than in Switzerland.
