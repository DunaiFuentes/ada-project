null,false,sherlockcafe,null,null,null,"Hi there,  last year my ex-boyfriend moved to Ticino from the US and I went and spent a month there with him. Ticino is supposedly not as expensive as some other regions, but it is still pricey. My ex is a native English speaker and learned German and Italian before moving to CH. He is fluent and got by well, made friends, etc. The main difficulty my ex had was finding a job. From my understanding, part of the school curriculum and general flow of things is that as part of your schooling, you do an apprenticeship in the field or job you want. After about two years, you take a test and then you are qualified. Being American with a Swiss Visa, my ex had difficulty finding work because all of these places (blue collar, construction, etc) wanted proof of apprenticeship or lots of past experience at a Swiss job. Apartment hunting seemed difficulty so I won't be able to share experience on that.  When my ex inquired re low skilled job, like McDonalds, they were usually not hiring or required certain qualifications.

CH recently passed legislation limiting immigration into the country. Though you are a citizen, if your language skills in German, Italian or French (mostly German, but depends on what canton you settle in) isn't up to par, people may be wary of your immigration status and may not hire you. I am not saying that this will happen, and it may or may not apply to you, but I am sensitive to such things and I feel it is something to consider. I think the Swiss are very, very nice and almost all of the folks I met extended great courtesy and advice. However, my general sense of the Swiss attitude is that they are wary of foreigners coming into their countries for jobs and benefits. Its not hostile, but they definitely pay attention.

Regarding cost of living, [I recently found this site that may be helpful to you] (http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/). It is supposedly user-generated/submitted data regarding cost of living in different parts of the world. I'm unable to give you an estimate on what is needed, but it will be quite a bit, similar to what u/weeefapfap had mentioned (CHF 2800-3800).

Finally, it may be worth stopping by the embassy. My ex stopped by the labor center and they were somewhat helpful. Not the same, but my assumption is that the Swiss are just darn helpful and its worth a try.

Finding help within sozialhilfe and rav is legitimate and the institutions provided a lot of help.
However, it takes some time (I would guess 3 months) to get the process running. So you need some own money for the starting time, because you will not find a job from the beginning, and also it will be very hard to find an appartement. There are easily 30 interested persons for such an appartement (I live in a city).

For my example, one was living with another person, but was under pressure because that person was to leave switzerland. The other one was even accompanied by a person from ""gassenarbeit"", so I believe he had not a permanent place to be at all, after coming here. Both showed great will to succeed, but where also quite shy, probably because they where turned down a lot, outside of the social institutions. So expect the beginning to be hard, there is no kickstart, just a slow exhausting process to get independent and standing on your own feet.
It's important to organise a place where you can stay a longer period of time for the beginning.

Despite all difficulties: the one who got the appartement apparently found work and will do the military soon, meaning he's out of sozialhilfe for the first time beeing here, which must feel great.
