Service consists of an initial 18 or 21 weeks boot-camp followed by yearly 3-4 weeks of Wiederholungskurs (=exercises for the reserves) and a yearly shooting exercise.

What I was told as a conscript is that the army serves to do the following things:

* Protect Switzerland from Terrorists (I am not even kidding here)
* Help cleaning up, restoring power and communications after a natural disaster (eg: in Basel all the pharma production is built earthquake resistant, but power, water and internet would probably be unavailable after a major earthquake - the army would then be tasked with restoring those services) 
* protecting/helping in organizing some events (WEF, OSCE Minister meetings, some national sporting competitions, ensuring mobile communication during some sporting events int he alps)
* air policing (well, from 8:00-12:00 and 13:30-17:00 anyways - if you hijack an aircraft outside of these time-slots, the French will have to take over for us)

Interestingly, Switzerland is part of the Third World; during the Cold War Swizeland would neither join the American side (First World), nor align with the Soviet Block (Second World). Thus we became part of the nonaligned States.
