null,false,DeepDuh,zh,Zürich,null,"I wouldn't be too sure about this. Until end of 18th century, being mercenary seems to have been one of the main sources of wealth for Swiss Germans. When this changed (Napoleonic times, mercenaries couldn't compete with drafted national armies anymore), Switzerland became one of the poorest countries in Europe, leading to lots of emigration to the US.

Intuitively I'd say the mercenary trade was a side-effect of a Swiss culture that *does* in fact still heavily influence how we're doing business: The unwillingness to give much power to a central government, or to put it differently, the willingness and drive for self government, giving much more trust to local organizations rather than centralized ones. The armament of common people and then the mercenarism was just following from that, as was banking secrecy and lenient laws towards cooperative organizations. Without those, FIFA would probably never have located themselves in Switzerland. I wouldn't be surprised if they moved to a place like Hong Kong or Singapore now.

So yeah, mercenarism was not a *cause*, but it's IMO related to the culture that made this stuff possible. And btw. I'm also against changing too much of that culture. For organizations that only operate within Switzerland, this model has been very successful and as a Swiss citizen I feel freer than anywhere else in the world. If there's a 'land of the free' I'd put my finger on Switzerland, even after having lived abroad in different countries for some time now. What we *do* have to change is to not allow these rights to essentially foreign and/or international organizations that just leech on this leniency and have the potential to damage our culture.
