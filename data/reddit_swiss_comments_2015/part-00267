You'll need a lot of money to pull that off as well as fluent French skills. If that is not realistic, then you need a Mechanical Engineering Bachelor's in the USA or wherever you live and maybe like $20k saved up for the master's. Then you can do the MS in Switzerland. That'll help you get your foot in the door visa-wise and help you establish a professional network. You could also approach the field of robotics from the computer science perspective.
