It's very close by so you shouldn't be looking at more than a few euros. 

Hope that helps. 

Couldn't find the journey on Voyages SNCF which is like the Europe train booking site but it's likely because it's a very regional journey and they're better booked at the ticket office (or the national train site) as opposed to the big cross Europe journeys. 

Get the train from Bergamo to Chiasso and either get an ongoing train from there to Riva or just get a taxi. Like I say, 15 minutes in the car.

EDIT: It appears as though there is some kind of tram or metro. Chiasso to Riva S Vitale (Piazza) which I assume is the centre of Riva. It's about £1.50. Book here although it's highly likely to be easier just doing it at Chiasso. http://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets.html

On the Switzerland note, ya I also agree mostly. There's no where where you can't see a mountain that defines the border to another country. I live in Vaud not far from Geneva, and if I look to one side theres the Alps leading to France and Italy, and on the other side the Jura leading to France. I don't completely agree about the hiking thing. I guess you live near Lausanne, so you'll know the Jura and maybe that whole La Dole - St. Cergue - La Cure region. I'd say that you can get pretty lost in the forests in the mountains and through pastures up there. I went on a two day hiking trip and easily went 6 hours of walking without seeing any civilization. Nothing compared to Canada, but my point was just that Switzerland looks pretty small compared to surrounding countries, which it is, but it's a bit deceptive. From Lake Geneva to the top of the Jura on the map seems like nothing, but walking that is a full day trip.

Don't get me wrong it's not like I'm offended that you're calling it tiny, it's just a word I would never use for a country (apart from Monaco and the like). Canada is definitely massive, and Switzerland is small in comparison, but you could live a lifetime in virtually any country and not see everything, so the term is just a bit weird to me",null,0,null,1431819589,null,0,1431825099,0,crbgoxh,null,t3_366ehc,null,t1_crbgoxh,null,t1_crbet5w,null,null,null,1433103926,null,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1,null
