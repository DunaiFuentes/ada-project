null,false,DeepDuh,zh,Zürich,null,"Lots of negativity here. I'm seeing this a bit differently. Seeing it from the opposite perspective, there's several reasons why I as a Swiss would not want to live in the US. The most important one is that I'd feel powerless, even as a citizen, versus certain laws that I cannot agree with, like overly zealous child protection laws that have the potential to rip apart families on the basis of trivial things that we do daily in Switzerland (like letting 6 year olds walk to Kindergarden in groups without adults). I don't want to discuss this particular law, it's just an example of a part of civil life I can't agree with. So what's the difference then, there are laws in Switzerland too, right? Let me make my case why it's different here:

1) As a Swiss I'm actually capable of making a difference in terms of government if I don't agree with something and if I can convince enough other common people from my cause, i.e. force a Referendum or even the vote for a new law.

2) Since Switzerland is federal almost to an extreme, to the point where most regulations that affect me personally are either communal or cantonal, i.e. shared by between 500 and 1M people. This means that, for changing something that affects me, the number of people that I (or my amateur political organization) has to convince is small enough that I don't need to spend millions on a campaign - if I find enough helpers sharing my view, it can in fact be done by just paying for the print material and some gas/train fare money. 

3) So why can't you do this (i.e. points 1 and 2) in the indirect democracy used in the US? Why is OP completely powerless if he wants to stop American involvement in foreign wars, even though many of his contemporaries probably share his views (see the stats I've posted elsewhere here)? Well, from what I can see, [the American election system is mostly broken](http://www.cgpgrey.com/politics-in-the-animal-kingdom/). There's just no-one to vote for that will actually do a difference in that regard, because your vote will not count. And without a few billion dollars in stock you won't be able to do anything about this.

4) I find the authorities in Switzerland to be quite lenient when it comes to everyday issues. As a citizen I can with very high certainty just follow 'common sense' without knowing all the legal technicalities, and I'll never be bothered with the law - the law is only there to cover the corner cases, everything else, while many regulations exist, most of them are not relevant anymore and wouldn't be accepted in court, and there isn't much chance for you having to go there anyway. The main difference is probably that it's almost impossible to get a lot of money through civil lawsuits, so noone bothers.

So, because of this, I have to say that I can't find anything wrong with someone who wants to vote with his feet, if he can't vote at the ballot. So OP, if this issue is close to your heart and you don't have too many responsibilities that tie you to your home country, and you are well informed about what you'll expect at your destination, then go for it. 

Just let me add here, that immigrating to Switzerland is very very tough for non-EU citizens. A fact that I'm actually very sad about, and something I'd like to get politically involved with in order to change (however at the moment it seems like this might change by just letting politics run their course in a few years, i.e. our contracts with the EU going down the drain). Even if you find a way to immigrate (basically a work contract or marriage), be aware that becoming a citizen involves learning a national language and takes 5-10 years of your life. If that's still OK for you then go for it - otherwise there's plenty of countries you could look into, that are more welcoming to immigrants. 

Best of luck anyway.

For some background, my parents are Swiss immigrants to the US, and I came to do my (mandatory) military service in Switzerland and decided I liked it better here.  Now let me explain why.

Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but that opinion may or may not be realistic or worth sharing.  The biggest issue I find with the American mindset is that everyone is convinced that *their* way is right regardless of their actual qualifications on the matter.  There's a reason the evolution debate is only really an issue in the US.  I'm still fairly young but I've worn a lot of hats in my life so far and the most important thing I've learned is that the more you know about anything the less outrageous it will seem (should it be outrageous at all), which means that it would be idiotic to hold opinions on subjects I don't understand in depth.  Swiss people, at the very least, keep their opinions to themselves.  Americans shout their beliefs to anyone who will listen and many who won't.

If you'll pardon me making assumptions to your politics (as you do seem to be part of a particular *type*), there are some issues that you're likely to find with the culture here:

* The army is 'mandatory', and a good 2/3 of men do military service.  You will see them out and about in uniform and frequently carrying assault rifles.  Furthermore, they take their service weapons home when not actively attending military service.  I believe the guns-to-people ratio is pretty close to 1:2 here.
* Private gun regulation is relatively lax compared to other countries, and many people are competitive shooters (myself included).  While you won't see it every day, seeing a guy with a gun is not uncommon.
* There's a federal shooting range in nearly every town in Switzerland.  Foreigners seem to like to buy houses next door and then make noise complaints to get them shut down.  Please don't do this.  It's a huge pain in the ass for everybody and it isn't hurting anything.

* [Goldenpass Express](http://www.goldenpass.ch/en) Lucerne? Check. Bernese Oberland? Check. Montreux? Check. Also a bit long, but also very cool. Only disadvantage: You have to change trains quite often (five or six times). But worth it. (From Montreux go back to Zurich via Lausanne)

* Ticino! Just drive to Lugano or Locarno and back. You'll cross the Alps (well, you'll drive beneath them). So you will see mountains all day long. But it's also an interesting trip because the [Gotthard line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthard_railway) is a technological marvel. Also: You'll end up in Ticino, which is culturally a different part of Switzerland.

* Ticino again! Go to Locarno and take the [Centovalli Railway](http://www.centovalli.ch/centovalli/home/home.php?lang=EN) which looks like a tram and has written FART on it. You'll laugh, but soon you'll be speachless because of the scenery. The train will take you to Domodossola, Italy where you can take a train to Brig and from there one to Zurich. Yeah, for a short time you'll be in Italy. No problem though, the ticket you buy in Zurich (or the day pass) is valid here. 

* Appenzell. If this all is a bit to long for you or you want a more relaxed alternative: Take a train to Gossau. Board the tiny train of the Appenzeller Bahnen. In it you have a beautiful view of the Alps. Get out in Appenzell which is cute and small, buy some cheese and beer. Then go back to the station, take another train to St. Gallen. There you should eat a Bratwurst (just don't order mustard).

* Bonus tip: Trains are nice to travel. But don't forget about boats! Best place for a boat trip is IMO Lake Lucerne (Lake Zurich is nice. But you don't want nice. You want a spectacular view!). So drive to Lucerne and board the boat that makes the whole trip to Flüelen. There you take the train and you'll be back in Zurich one hour later. But I know people who just stayed on the boat and headed back to Lucerne on it. [This site has all the information](http://www.lakelucerne.ch/en.html). If you're into steam boats, do some research, you might be able to do the trip on one of them.

null,false,Mundanus,null,null,null,"In addition I would now write a lot. In short, it has huge significance for the fundamental understanding of the universe, in very many respects:

Why there is mass of elementary particles. Without this, there would be no matter in the form of atoms or molecules, for example, because one massless electrons in atomic shells could bind anywhere. The property of elementary particles to have mass, is anything but self-evident. In the standard model it violates fundamental symmetries, upon which the standard model. But much more simply: If after Einstein mass just one form of energy is, why can I not simply a particle so very ""slow down"" or ""cool"" that its mass disappears? The energy of a sufficiently fast moving particle consists almost entirely of kinetic energy. If I ever ever ever abbremse like it or cool, why there is still a residual energy E0 = m0   x c² left, no matter what I'm doing? The answer is the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) field: mass is interaction with the BEH-field. The most impressive image to the CMS experiment has shown (upwards BEH-coupling, to the right mass):

http://inspirehep.net/record/1261762/files/CMS-Regge.png

And now that we understand that, we can further ask: Why now have different particles, different couplings to the BEH-field? This will attract a huge number of experiments to be.

We do not know much about the BEH-field:

* Is it ""homogeneous"" (scientific terms: a single field) or there are several BEH-field superimposed/mixed? It is actively researched. Supersymmetry says as previously, that there should be at least 2 different fields with 5 different excitation possibilities = Higgs bosons. Then we would have to find 4 other Higgs bosons. It is researched.

* Is it ""elementary"" that is, composed of no further sub-blocks? It does so in particle physics the same role as the magnetization in ferromagnetism (consisting of small elementary magnets) or the Cooper-field in the superconductor (which consists of electron pairs). So far all those fields are non-elementary. Maybe also the BEH-field?

* If the electroweak vacuum in which the BEH-field is located, only metastable, i.e., is our universe in a local energy minimum, but could in principle turn into an energetically lower-lying state blowing itself, would dissolve completely all that is in it?

The BEH-field is the first prototype of an elementary (?) spin-zero field. Such spin-zero fields are for cosmology (for example inflation) extremely important. Does the BEH-field to do with it? If not, you can at least by examining the BEH-field draw conclusions on the other spin-zero fields?

Will there eventually be applications?

The discovery BEH-field, which was demonstrated by his suggestion, the Higgs boson, is the opening of a door into a completely unknown territory. We have not, as is often said, complete the standard model, on the contrary. We come straight into a completely new yet completely unexplored area of our universe and are extremely excited about what we find there. The Higgs particle is the door to this new area.

Nein, es geht hier darum das die Schweizer Banken wie UBS wissen, dass die Gelder die auf ihren Konten liegen dort unversteuert liegen.
Die Mails aus den vielen vielen Gerichtsverhandlungen legen nahe, dass gerade die UBS sehr genau weiss wieviel von dem Geld sie eigentlich zu unrecht hat.
UBS hat auch lange die bescheuerte Meinung vertreten ""Unwissenheit schützt vor Strafe"" und als denen dann dämmerte, dass man trotzdem Ärger kriegen kann und damit wertvolles lebenswichtiges Geld abfließen würde hat man sich entschieden den Judas zu machen und ist als Welt-Kronzeuge gegen alle aufgetreten.

Also ich würde die Schweiz daher unter keinen Umständen mehr als zivilisiert bezeichnen - begrüße aber den Versuch sich wieder der westlichen Welt anzuschließen.

You seem to be leaning towards the Green trail, I'd probably choose the red one. Less hut density, the landscape is more spectacular (check the pictures in Google Earth) and you can avoid the most touristic areas. 

The higher up you sleep the better the experience. So pack some days worth of food, no need to go down to the villages every day.
