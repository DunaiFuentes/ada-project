The reason you have been able to earn money and get assets is because the context (the laws, the structures, the consumers, etc...) has allowed you to earn something.

Considering that once you have earned anything, it's ""yours"" is like having a friend giving you a fishing pole, get some fish, feed yourself and you don't share with your friend saying he didn't do shit to earn it.

I want to be sure that we speak the same level of ""performance-oriented perspective"" What is the reference for you?

* Best return on investment
* Best use of natural resources

In a sandbox context (as we have on earth) I would argue the latter makes more sense. Finite planet, finite resources, you get my point. Maybe I'm not that liberal but I still hope for a world where rules are not needed for people to manage to live together. I mean, on the premise that we have enough resources for everyone, if not, that's another story.


&gt; The context that allows you to earn money and get assets is such that you are protected from the government arbitrarily interfering with you doing so.

You are partly right there, the government also provides protection to the population from the population. You could revoke the power you give it but then you'll end up needing to do your own law and be in conflict every day of your life. This could work... And you are right if you say that the law of the jungle is equally valid globally since there is no true ""better"" way to live in society since there is no ""true"" purpose of the human race. I still do prefer a society where people can trust and work together... It's just more fun to my eyes.

&gt;You gave him all the materials and know-how to build it and paid him to do so.

I think I'm confused here. What about the material used to create the fishing pole, who ""owns"" that?

&gt; All the ""income inequality is bad"" crowd are really arguing is that they're jealous of those who make more money than they do.

I don't think we can have a perfectly balanced society, but I do think having a big gap between the poor and the rich is a problem in the long run. You just get more trouble in terms of civil obedience, sharing, coworking and the system becomes inefficient in the long run. Do I have to elaborate on that or do you agree?

&gt; Your assumption that the cutoff will stay at 2 million is pretty darn naïve, too.

Actually, I don't see where I gave you that impression. I never assumed that it would not change... But I mean... why should it not change?

From there walk to Central and take the Polybahn (The red cablecar) which brings you to the University. There you will have a nice view from the Polyterasse over the city. Maybe you see some places you want to see from there.

When you're done and (hopefully) don't need to visit anyone in one of the best hospitals of the world take the tram (5) to Kunsthaus (the art museum) which has free entrance every wednesday.

Once you are hungry after watching all those paintings and sculptures, walk down or take the tram again to Bellevue. Get a Bratwurst mit Bürli (sausage with bread) from the Sternen Grill.

Eat your lunch somewhere at the lake and enjoy the view to the Üetliberg (the one on the other side of the lake with the 2 towers on the top). If you'd have enough time I recommend you to go up there.

Afterwards you can shop down the Bahnhofstrasse with all it's expensive boutiques or the Niederdörfli which has some small shops on the opposite side of the Limmat (the river which flows out of the lake) back to the main station. You actually could do both there are bridges to cross all the time.
