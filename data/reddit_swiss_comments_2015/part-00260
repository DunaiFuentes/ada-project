AFAIR UBS charges 5CHF for an exchange if you don't have an account there. You should be able to exchange at the post offices as well, no idea if they have a fee. As already mentioned, the online rate you usually find is just the interbank exchange rate (the spread there is far far lower because they mostly deal in millions). So your amount is not really relevant and doesn't come into a zone where there are special exchange rates, you will just get the rate that's offered.
Also, it's extremely likely that a cash transaction has to be done through CHF, so you will pay the spread USD-&gt;CHF and CHF-&gt;EUR. you might want to take that into consideration. I don't know how banks in Germany handle stuff like that but I doubt there would be big issues doing that. Again, 10k is not all that much.
