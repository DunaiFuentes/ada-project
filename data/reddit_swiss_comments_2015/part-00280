null,false,Gimly,fr,Fribourg,null,"I'm not saying Switzerland is bad and I do appreciate that we have a good economy, and believe that one of the reason is probably because we try to stay relatively balanced between liberal and social. But, as someone who leans more on the left part of the political quadrant I also think that we could/should do way better socially and that there is a trend that lead us to more liberal rules which is something that, I think, will hurt the country in the long run.

Basically, what other western europe countries have better than us (definitely not exhaustive, just examples).

* Minimum wage. We have none in Switzerland and the amount of ""working poor"" is growing. It is especially problematic for a country where basic stuff (food, etc.) is quite expensive. [See here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_in_Europe_by_minimum_wage) for a list of European countries who do have minimum wage.
* No paternity leave and one of the shortest maternity leave in Europe [see this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave#Europe_.28inc._Eastern_Europe_and_Central_Asia.29). 
* Inequalities in terms of taxes, with the very rich being offered tax exemptions or ""fixed price"" taxes.
* Expensive and difficult to find day care for children
* Incredibly expensive care for elders, which they basically have to pay from their pockets
