This is exactly what the population and a lot of politicians want. Way too low Ausnutzungsziffer, ridiculous Einspracherecht, Schattenwurfartikel, the right wing still dreaming of an ""each man his house with a private garden""-world, the left bombarding any and all big projects for a million of other stupid reasons.

Look at Zurich west as a prime example of how to completely fuck up the chance for being forward thinking and turning a whole Kreis into a soulless landscape with 200 meters of concrete between buildings.

Once you have a ""real"" place, rents aren't *that* high compared to other world-class cities compared to income and quality of life. I paid the same amount for a shitty pad in Toronto but was making 3 times less money.

I doubt that your German will have to be perfect to drive a truck, but someone correct me if I'm wrong.

About racism: I wish I could tell you otherwise, but from my personal experience Switzerland can be quite xenophobic. Most black immigrants in Switzerland are asylum seekers from Africa who have entered Europe illegally to escape economic conditions or conflicts in their home countries. Because of their difficult legal status they tend to work under-the-table and are disproportionately involved in criminal endeavors (or at least that is the perception). The situation is somewhat similar to the situation of South American immigrants in the United States. Unfortunately you will probably be assumed to be an illegal immigrant by many people you meet, much like Hispanic and Latino Americans often have to deal with the perception that they are illegal immigrants in the United States.
