null,false,Lejeune_Dirichelet,be,Bern,null,"Here my take on the matter:

* political parties should be transparent about their budget and spending for every single campaign/votation

* past a certain amount (~ 4 or 5 times the basic membership contribution), the identity of the donator should be made public

* political parties should get a (small) punishment for endorsing initiatives that don't pass

* parties should have another venue where they can publicly position themselves on certain topics (though I don't know how it would look like)

Reasons: first 2 are for controlling the power of money in the political debate, third is for forcing parties to be actually constructive and ready to compromise when using the tools of direct democracy; fourth is for letting them masturbate the feelings of their voters in a safe, responsible environment. Furthermore:

* No more of those papers I get in the mail by some campaigners, because somebody said it counts as ""political information"", and not ""shameless propaganda""

* As mentionned in the article, parliament can invalodate an initiative if it affects more than one topic; but let's face it, ""invalidating"" is a very scary word. Rather, the parlient should have the power to split an initiative (in self contained parts that make sense when applied alone), for no better reason than because it wants too.

* basic political education, both on the federal and cantonnal levels, should be part of primary education. That would also mean: where can I find reliable statistics on an issue, analysing the impact of specifoc initiatives in the past, etc

* The federal council needs to do a MUCH better job at educating the population. And that would mean, for instance, distributing pamphlets explaining the situation and the arguments BEFORE the compaign starts - not after, when most people already know what they will vote.

* If a results in a popular vote is within a certain margin (both in the number of cantons and overall votes), then it should be accepted that not everybody in this country wants to follow the same path, and provision that could have been made on the cantonal level (wherever possible) should be made non-mandatory for the individual cantons to apply.",null,0,null,1428439897,null,0,1428440390,0,cq4jl81,null,t3_31qjqo,null,t1_cq4jl81,null,t3_31qjqo,null,null,null,1432253531,null,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2,null

I'm thinking aeroport, main train stations, petrol stations along the most frequented parts of the A1 and maybe a few stores in the biggest cities; more would simply not make sense because there isn't a demand for it. Most people will still buy their groceries during normal hours.

On the topic of retail workers: we have a shortage of jobs for low skilled workers. An increase in opening hours would create more jobs. Also don't forget that nights and weekends pay substantially better. About the point of those poor people missing out on life: haa haa haa. What about all the others working 24/7 keeping our infrastructure running that you take for granted? Why are the retail workers to be protected from the epic burden of working unusual hours while all the others are not? I'm talking pilots, traffic controllers, policemen, power station and network operators, datacenter and telco network operators, doctors, nurses, and so on and so forth.  

No sir you wouldn't change nighttime culture because as I said, only comparatively few stores will be open late or 24/7, the actual demand will regulate that, see other countries.

Now on the power issue. If a store is open or closed makes only a minor difference in power consumption. Much of the light and all of the refrigerators, computers etc are on 24/7.

null,false,Zorthianator,ag,Aargau,null,"Hi there!

Usually you don't need a membership to shoot at a private range. Although I would recommend you to look into [Brünig](http://www.bruenigindoor.ch/de/) and [Selgis](http://www.selgis.ch/) which I consider to be the best shooting ranges in Switzerland. There are plenty of other smaller shooting ranges like the VIP Security in Bellach, Waffen Ingold in Höchstetten and plenty others scattered throughout Switzerland.

Another way would be to join a shooting society (Schiessverein) where you will pay around 50 Fr. each year and you will be able to shoot.

&gt;What about the guns allowed at ranges? I know you can get a pump action rifle or a AK with the necessary acquisition permit here, but I can imagine most shooting ranges are specialized on pistols/simple rifles?

Private shooting ranges like Brünig and Selgis allow you to shoot every gun you want since they have special shooting ranges. There are other ranges that only allow you to shoot pistol caliber guns though.

Here's a list:

https://www.gunfactory.ch/div/schiessk.htm

For the ""Shooting Societies"" you can only use certain guns such as the Stgw 90 (SIG 550), Stgw 57 (SIG 510), K31, P210, P220, Glock 17/19 and Sphinx handguns.

&gt;Are there any courses (maybe even from the police) where you can actually train how to handle a weapon - instructed by professionals?

Yes, Brünig and Selgis offer you such courses, there are also private companies that will teach you how to handle a gun. Normally if you want to join a shooting society they will instruct you on how to handle a gun.

&gt;How about joining a club (if I got time in the far future): What is the usual process? Most shooting clubs I looked up don't have a direct way to sign up (except for e.g. junior shooting events), so just call them, visit a meeting?

Just call them and ask for a ""Schnuppertag"" where you can shoot with someone that belongs to the club. Once you are interested they will let you join the club. It's pretty simple.

There are also IPSC clubs if you want something with a bit of action.",null,0,null,1428482786,null,0,1428482983,0,cq55d11,null,t3_31ug17,null,t1_cq55d11,null,t3_31ug17,null,null,null,1432264001,null,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3,null

you mostly need proof of insurance if you go to a range for the first time. I myself go to http://www.schiesskeller.ch, you have to be a member though (roughly 800$ a year).

Also it sometimes depends on where you're from. They don't allow citizens of certain countries (mostly eastern ones) in some places.

As Zorthianator posted before me, the type of gun/caliber depends largely on the range. Selgis and Brünig Indoor are the only ones I know of where you can shoot almost anything. The one I visit only allows pistol/revolver calibers up to .44 magnum (no Casul or .500).
