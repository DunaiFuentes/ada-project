So [this chart](http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d02/images/figures/1f_A_1.gif) says she is between 10 and 13. If I'm not mistaken, 13 would be the time where she'd usually (ZH) decide between ""Gymnasium"" (nothing sports related, that's just what it's called, ok?) which is a  kind of school that leads to college/university. 

The other path could be ""Sekundarschule"" which usually leads to vocational training (this somewhat of a Swiss specialty) - check this here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_education_system

From there you can either just do your job (and move up the career ladder etc.) and/or you can add the ""Berufsmatura"" which opens up some paths into universities of applied sciences (Fachhochschule), which are somewhat separate to universities (long story, ""Bologna Reform). Or you could ""come back"" and do that ""Gymnasium""-exam (1.5y of intense learning I've been told) and then go to University.

The Swiss vocational system is pretty good - IMHO much better than what other countries offer. You learn a standardized set of skills and get that certified by the state. So it's more than a (3-4 year) on the job training (but you do that too). The problem is that if you want to move up the career ladder, you might be missing a piece of paper that says ""Bacherlor"" or ""Master"" degree.

Hope this helps.. others might add everything I forgot. It's been a while since school (and since sleep, it's almost 4am..) Good luck.

Furthermore, she won't understand anyone (everyone speaks Swiss German to each other, only in lessons they have to speak Standard German) and may feel like an outsider.  
DaZ is only available at primary school level for the lower grades because it's expensive and after a certain age, pupils with different native languages (other than German should have caught up).

Secondly, you say your daughter is good at languages, that's cool! But can she read and write in German? These are basic skills she will need to follow classes and to do exams. Moreover, what about the other subjects like math etc?

Thirdly, as someone else said, there's an entry exam for pupils who want to go to Kantonsschule/Gymnasium. I don't know if your daughter can do that outside the normal period. You definetely should get in contact with some schools. 

I don't know, but I think repeating 6th grade would be the best option (maybe even a must for some schools). Everything else is too much stress. Not only the school part, also the social part may become somewhat a hassle :/ it's really not a good age for children to have to move :(
