If so I highly recommend Flumserberg. It's a little more than a one hour drive from Zurich and is super convenient. It's the closest decent ski resort. With 18 lifts and 65km, you'll be more than satisfied for one day. 
Bonus: Flumserberg even has a train connection from Zurich HB. 
On the weekend there is a direct train (S2) from Zurich HB to Unterterzen which brings you right to the gondola station of the ski resort in 1h10min. 

If you have more time and want more lifts, you can go to:

Davos: Biggest ski resort around, but you have to get on a car shuttle train

Flims/Laax: ideal if you like freestyle skiing and snowboarding

Lenzerheide: generally nice, especially for skiers
