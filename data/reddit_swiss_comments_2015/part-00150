Generally, friendships can last lifetime, but if one of you moves somewhere else, it isn't really the same anymore. It's very likely, that you talk less (after a while) to each other and a used to be really good friendships becomes to a ""What's new in you life?"" friendship, just because you don't really know as much what is going on in his life as you use to...


There are too kinds of friendships:

Made as a child/teenager/young adult. We were simple, tons of other people within the same age range around --&gt; easy! These friendships normally grow up with you and they are just fine!

Made as an adult: We are fucking complicated and meeting people beside work has to be done actively. Most of the other people around you already have friends. So you have to fit in the whole group or it is nearly impossible. That is why joining a club is useful, it gives you a common base of interests. But still, being the new guy is never easy...

I don't know why it is harder here to find friends, but I guess it has to do with the ""someone talks to me -&gt; What does he want from me?"" logic which we have stronger developed as people from somewhere else. I wouldn't say that it is polite, but we are like this and others have to accept that. If you put a Swiss into a new location, he will seek for other Swiss (preferably from the same area). After that he will try to find the closest Europeans, after that similar countries and finally the rest of the world. This is base on my experience from travelling when you met other Swiss within a group.


Also we probably prefer a chat to friends more than a small talk with a stranger. But I would bet most of us prefer a small talk instead of just waiting for someone/something. Especially in bars this is the time when you meet new people (except for nowadays with smartphones...).

I have seen *life-long friendships* dissolved by little more than a guy getting an unpopular girlfriend, or over a 30 minute political disagreement.

From my point of view, based on my feelings of attachment, swiss germans simply don't bond. They don't. They don't form human attachments. They have the same level of commitment to their own brothers that I feel towards ""an ok friend"", and their notion of a close friend is my notion of a vague acquaintance. 

It took me 5 years to penetrate society far enough to learn this, and you can imagine that it was extremely painful, but also allowed me to understand why people had been acting the way they had.
