* Reproductive medicine: I think it's a decent compromise between preventing abuse and protecting parents' legitimate interest to have healthy children.

I'll almost certainly vote yes.
* Stipends: Haven't studied the topic in depth. I tend to agree with /u/buyacasha that the motivation of the initiators seems rather fishy though, and whenever someone wants to increase spending without telling us how to generate the revenue required, I get skeptical. Tending towards a no at this point.
* Estate tax: Not in favor. There are currently only three Cantons that tax children inheriting assets from their parents (AI, VD, NE), and this would expand the practice to the whole country. While two million seems fairly high, there is no reason to assume there won't be a push to lower it over time. Add to that the fact that all property in an estate has already been taxed, so taxing it again when you die seems less than fair; I have some sympathies for those referring to it as the ""Death Tax"" for that reason.
