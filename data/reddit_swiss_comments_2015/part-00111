Cheyenne. 30CHF/p, best burger in town (even compared to holy cow IMO). loud/pub style.

Original Kebab House. 10-20CHF/p. Best Döner I know. Freshly made flat bread. Get the Jumbo.

* *Le Restaurant de Crissier*. After Fredy Girardet and Philippe Rochat, Benoit Viollier is the chef in what is probably the best restaurant in Switzerland - and one of the most expensive too. It has 19 in the Gault-Millau and 3 stars in the Michelin (both the maximum grade available). It is absolutely not a disappointment, but you might just have to mortgage your house to pay the bill.

* *Restaurant du Cerf*, in Cossonay. Here, the chef is Carlo Crisci, and it's also a great gastronomical restaurant, also with many stars and awards all over the place, and also very good.

* *Beau-Rivage Palace restaurant*, with Anne-Sophie Pic at the helm. Again, it's a great place (or so I've heard), in a wonderful atmosphere and style, but rather expensive - as befits a 5* hotel's restaurant.

Those are the ""classic"" gastronomical restaurants you'll learn about in guide books. As for my personal favs:

* *Le Baron Tavernier/Le Deck*, in Chexbres. If you want to blow your SO/family away, go there on a sunny day. The food is good, but the real attraction is the location, on top of the Lavaux vineyards, with a fountain that seems to be part of the lake. It's honestly one of the most beautiful places I know, and it's a great place to show tourists why we love our canton.

* *L'Auberge communale*, in Mollens. Just at the foot of the Jura mountains, this place serves pretty good fare the entire year, but the real attraction is in autumn, for hunting season. They are, unambiguously, the best at that.

* *Auberge de l'Onde*, in Saint-Saphorin. They have the best wine selection, especially in white wines, as befits a restaurant located in the Lavaux vineyards. The wine-person (*sommelier* in French, no idea how to say that in English), Jerome Aké, was chosen as the best in the country this year.

* *Eligo*, in Lausanne. This new restaurant (opened last December), tucked in a hidden corner of the Rotillon, in Central Lausanne, has a wonderful set of meals. The tartare in particular is just splendid.

* *Café des Tramways*, in Renens. While it might not be exactly on the same footing as the other places I've mentioned, it's still great, and has a very good price-quality ratio.

* *Le Saint-Paul*, in Lausanne. Some of the best Italian food in town, for reasonably cheap prices and in a charming location, with always nice waiters.
