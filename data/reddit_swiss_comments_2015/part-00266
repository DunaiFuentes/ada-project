How is it done, first the headline. Most of headline are about the ""big bad world"": terror, murder, drugs, car accident, social drama...  Pretty much reflect our world and what we see and experience everyday right? Only exception are major sports victories, it's positive on first sight but reenforce the national spirit in order to condition you in a pro nation vs foreigner state of spirit, giving even more impact on the following articles that talk about these evil people who did horrible thinks and strangely are foreigner or with origins from another country (they always stress on this information if it's the case).

The trick is to play on reader emotion, if he is shocked, affected or revolted, he will be in a state of spirit that made him reads more the ads and memorize them much more easily. After these terrible news you will get more positive news like new product, movie, travel advise, concerts and shows to see. These make the reader think: "" at least some nice stuff happening in the world, this news video games/concert/movie/gadget seams pretty cool, it will relax me after a long day of awful work, fighting vs all the evil thinks in this world, what a mony well spend"". And you have sold your product, it could be using a proper ad or an ad hidden in an article the result will be the same (don't think that the author has chosen to speak about the last blockbuster movie because he loved it and he think it's a very good movie, he must talk about it and be mostly positive in his 3 sentences review because he is asked to do so, whatever he think about the quality of the movie).

Just take the time to analyse the 20min newspaper from time to time, see how it's constructed, what articles are put in front or in the opposite hidden in a small square at the corner of a page. Look at the order of the news, always the same, leading you to the commercial pages. Look where the ads are placed and what they are selling and in which way. Today French edition is perfect example of what I said, like most edition probably. A TV journal on a private channel will have a similar construction, on TF1 or M6 for example (I don't watch German TV, but I'm sure there are a lot similarities). Swiss channels from RTS are less in the case because they are public and they have some money from the taxes that could be use to build some better contents.

Dirty little secret: Zurich kinda sucks. The good news, virtually everything close to Zurich, especially on its lake, is really awesome. I heartily recommend a lake tour - or better yet, go over to Lucerne (as many have recommended, and rightly so - Lucerne is lovely) and a boat tour of the lake of Lucerne, or go up to Pilatus. 

A few other things that are more travel-intensive, but doable if you are on the trains: Meiringen, which is where the Aar Gorge (Aareschlucht in German) is, and that's a really neat, and surprisingly cheap, thing to do. It also happens to be at Reichenbach, which, if there are Sherlock Holmes fans in your group, is really fun. A little farther out, Interlaken is gorgeous, and, close to Interlaken, you have Grindelwald, which puts you at the base of the Eiger mountain, and, for serious ducats, you can take the tunnel up to Jungfraujoch, which is very spectacular, and worth its considerable price. Alternatively, there is Wengen, which overlooks the Lauterbrunnen Valley, or Luaterbrunnen, which is IN the Lauterbrunnen Valley. This is also the landscape that inspired Rivendell in Lord of the Rings, so if you have any of THOSE nerds in your group, there you go.

Even a bit farther, but much faster to reach, is Bern, which has probably the prettiest old town outside of Lucerne in the country. 

Or, if you want to go for the *piece de resistance,* you can do what my wife and I are doing today - take a day trip to Zermatt and visit the Matterhorn. A few notes on this - one, make sure the weather is clear there. Not partly cloudy - CLEAR. Two, take the earliest train you can stand, it's about three hours' ride. But, the last hour of the ride there is amazing, and the town itself, though shamelessly touristic, still owns the single most spectacular sight in the country. Take the Gornergratbahn up to Gornergrat, where there is an observatory at 3100m with a clear view of the mountain. Hike back if you like. Don't worry about wearing yourself out, you have a train ride back. Or better yet, spend one (admittedly pricey) night in Zermatt.

I also agree with adoptions by non-heterosexuals, but I think it's wrong for people who naturally cannot have children to ""order"" a child by way of surrogate mothers and/or third party sperm. While I think having caring adults is in most cases psychologically better for children than having none, I cannot condone taking away a normal parental situation from a child just because two people see themselves equal to heterosexual couples. It's easy to imagine people wanting to be a parent and losing out on that aspect of life, but the well-being of the potential child is more important than equalizing-out any legal imbalance and more important than the non-heterosexual's feelings of missing out.

null,false,carcharoth84,be,Bern,null,"Anecdotal information: Few months ago, my Macbook had a swollen battery. So I checked the possibilities to repair it:    
Change the battery with a 3rd party battery without any warranty: 80.- for the battery    
Dataquest: Asked them twice for ""howmuchwillthiscost"", never got an answer.    
Heiniger AG: 230.-     
Apple according to their website: 150.-    
    
So, as I had to go to Zurich anyway, I visited the AppleStore at the Glattzentrum. After 1h of waiting time (yeah, I had an appointment with them. Somehow they forgot me.) they replaced the battery with a new one, including 90 days of warranty for the battery. For free. Because ""Yeah, it's quite normal, that the battery on this specific model will blew up, so we extended the warranty of the battery."" But of course they don't announce that publicly...   
    
So, for your LCD-Problem:  I'd just ask apple if they can replace it and how much it will cost, and when it's too much, I'd buy the spareparts from ifixit/aliexpress and do it by myself.    
    
Also, you can ask this company: http://www.macianer.com/mac
They repaired my iPod classic a few days ago and so far I'm quite happy.
