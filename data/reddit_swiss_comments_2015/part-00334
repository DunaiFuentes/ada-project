1. Because I want to use apps similar to facetime during train rides, the network coverage is priority A. That means I need access to the Swisscom network.
2. Because I am over 30 and want an abo, I have the choice between Natel Entry and Natel Infinity.
3. The necessary internet speed for facetime is between 2 and 20 Mbit/sec, while the necessary data volume for a 10 min call every day would be 4 MB *10 min * 30 days = 1200 MB. If I dont want to care about Volume (Surfing and music streaming adds to it), Natel Entry is out.
4. That means, the Natel Infinity Plus S or M fit best. I will start with S and if necessary, switch to M. This could be either due to more need for speed, or if I call numbers outside Switzerland more than 40 min / month.
