All the passes with a blue x to the left are closed for a few months.

I would recommend you to drive from Zurich to Andermatt and Realp, take the train (you drive on it with your car) to Oberwald and from their either make the big round via Martigny/Montreux/Bern or the shorter via Lötschberg (again a train) and Brünigpass via Lucerne back to Zurich.

The long route:

Please note that going clockwise, the last part from Sitten back to Zurich is pure freeway and not very interesting if you want to see mountains.

The short route: http://i.imgur.com/q5rEmTO.png

The short route is definitely the better choice here. You will pass some lakes, see more mountains and have the bigger pleasure to drive.

An alternative route would be Gotthard Pass and San Bernardino Pass (http://i.imgur.com/zxwwzWu.png). You would traverse the Gotthard through the road tunnel, drive down the canton Tessin to Lumino and then take the turn towards San Bernardino pass, wich also has a road tunnel. From there you would drive via Chur back to Zurich.

The Tessin is quite beautiful and the road back through Via Mala and Walensee is not bad either.

Also, instead of taking the freeway through Lucerne and around the west side of Lake Lucerne, you can take the freeway to Arth-Goldau and Brunnen after driving by Zug and pass the lake on the east side. Definitely more scenic but I guess the Axenstrasse (the road around the eastern lake shore) will take you more time. I plotted that road on the third map provided.

If you drive to Andermatt, make sure to leave the freeway in Erstfeld or Amsteg. You will want to drive up the valley off the freeway.

The same applies to the road from Splügen to Thusis on the alternative route I proposed. Get off the freeway and enjoy the ride down the Via Mala gorge.",null,0,null,1422760046,null,0,1422763460,0,co7d47h,null,t3_2ucgxp,null,t1_co7d47h,null,t3_2ucgxp,null,null,null,1424279075,null,5,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,5,null
