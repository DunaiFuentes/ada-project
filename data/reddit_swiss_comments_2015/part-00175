On the minus side: let's not get noticed, mind our own business, sometimes hide behind the rules (of politeness or hierarchy in the professional setting for example). Nobody can tell us what to do and how to deal with our stuff; I've found this particularly true, both on the personal side (won't take shit that's unasked for) and more generally on the political side (Europe and their rules: lol). Actually, that might be a good thing sometimes. 

On the plus side: honest, hard-working people with a strong sense of solidarity for those they consider their kins (from family to friends to the whole nation, possibly in that order). A good taste for alcohol, love of nature, simplicity and generosity, a strong sense of tradition and respect for our own history, and therefore a lot of respect for the traditions and history of others--provided they don't mess with ours. 

A good example of this sense of solidarity and ""greater good"" is how on many occasions people have voted for an increase of taxes. Oh yes, on the plus side: actual, true democracy in its direct form, lasting for 720+ years and counting.
