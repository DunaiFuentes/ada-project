The sad thing is if you would ask people on the street and formulate it like that then a lot of people would actually think it's a good idea.

I was once at a party and some idiot had some slightly racist views so to make fun of him I would act as if I supported him but with even more extreme views. Kind of like you just did in your comment. So instead of saying ""lets mark all the foreigners with a star and put them in concentration camps"", say something like ""wouldn't it also be better for the police and the well behaving foreigners if they could clearly be recognized?"". I was shocked how many people actually supported me and didn't realize that it was supposed to be a joke. And this wasn't some kind of right winger party or so, it was a normal student/house party.

&gt; it's getting crowded

btw. I hate this argument against foreigners, I can't hear it anymore. If you do the math then we would need to be 120 million in Switzerland to have the same population density as Singapore (yes, that excludes the mountains in Switzerland). And even Singapore has still green areas left. London has over 8 million in an area of the size of the Canton Zurich. Theoretically we could almost double the population size and still leave 95% of the country totally unchanged. There is more than enough space. Also more people = more taxes, so per capita little changes, actually with qualified immigrants it even improves so the government has rather more money to spend on infrastructure. It's not like the Swiss government can't afford it to spend money. Taxes are low and the country as almost no debt.
