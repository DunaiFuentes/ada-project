History of Belgium
History of South Africa
History of Zimbabwe 
History of the United States 

South Africa shows how the use of guilt and racism can manipulate opinion, and is also an enormous example of failure of socialism.

Zimbabwe shows the same as the above, plus how a government can become a dictatorship, nationalise farms and create famine as well as crashing the economy, all with good intentions.  

U.S. shows how socialism can use it's own failures to call for more socialism.

Now, those three examples are countries that are extremely different from Switzerland, so they don't hold much value as arguments unless you have a more comparable country.

Belgium.

Belgium is an interesting case, because it's divided into two cultures of different languages (much like Switzerland), and the country is divided politically as well.  

1900 was Belgium's golden age, Wallonia flourished thanks to coal mining, and it's miners would later be those who voted socialist.  Flanders flourished thanks the the ports that imported and exported the coal and steel produced in Wallonia.

Now, after that golden age, the coal trade stopped, and Flanders had to adapt by importing and exporting different goods, while Wallonia tried to adapt by developping it's metallurgy.  Fun fact : The socialist party in Belgium has been in power in Wallonia for a century until recently.  Flanders had had a more varied political landscape.

Socialist Belgium isn't a great place to live, because the whole country is poorer than before.  But Wallonia is a nightmare.  The unemployment is very high, education is extremely low, corruption is extremely common, public services are ridiculously bad.  In my city, I can't go buy bread 300m from my appartment without seeing 2-5 hobos.  Most small shops that open close within 4 months.

well, take a deep breath, make a step back, read the comments of this thread, and try to take your interlocutor's perspective.

From my personnal experience (yes, years of speaking in public, of taking university level communication classes), to make a point, you have to remain calm, to be as rational as possible. Even when your passionate about something, even when your interlocutor is heating up, you should stay calm, and try to argument with actual facts, statistics, or when you don't have them, at least rationnal arguments.
The more you loose control of yourself, the less the people will listen. The more your agressive, the more the people feel agressed, the more they want to fight you back.
So calm down, and try to make your point in a controlled, peaceful manner, and maby you'll be able to convince someone.

let us imagin that every day, 10 friends go for a drink in a pub, the bill is 100.- every night, which would make 10.- per person.
But the friends had decided to split up the bill in a proportional manner, a bit like the taxes.
which gave something like that :
*the first 4 paid nothing (the 4 poorest)
*the fifth would pay 1.-
*the sithy 3.-
*the seventh 7.-
*the eighth 12.-
*the neinth 18.-
*the tenth 59.- (because he was really rich)

they were all fairly happy with the situation, until one day the bar tender, trying to be nice, placed them in front of a big problem, he said: 

""since you're all good clients, I will make you a 20.- discount for tonight, so your 10 beers will cost you only 80.- ""
the group decided to pay the new bill with the same repartition than they did before and just soustract the same amount by the others. the first 4 would continue to drink for free, and they would split up the 20.- by 6, which ment 3.33.- discount for every one of them. But the 5ht and the 6th would then have to be paid to have a drink. So the bar tender proposed that the 20.- discount should be split proportionnaly to what the people already paid. 
so he did the math : 

*the 5th, like the 4 first one, paid nothing
*the 6th paid 2.- instead of 3.- (33% discount)
*the 7th paid 5.- instead of 7.- (28% discount)
*the 8th paid 9.- instead of 12.- (25% discount)
*the 9th paid 14.- instead of 18.- (22% discount)
*the 10th paid 50.- instead of 59.- (16% discount) the biggest amounth of reduction (but not percentage wise)

every one of the 6 that paid, paid less than the evenings before, and the 4 that didn't payed anyway continued to drink for free. 
But once outside of the Bar, everybody compared how much he had saved: ""I had only 1.- on the 20.- discount"" said the 6th, he showed the 10th and said ""he, he had 9.-"". the 5th agreed, ""I too had only 1.- savings"".

the 7th intervened and said "" its right !! why would he have the right to have 9.- when I just had 2.- ?? the richer had the biggest discount"".

""wait a minute"" said the first one, ""there are four of us that had nothing, this payment system is really against the poors"", the 9 other guys encircled the 10th and insulted him.

The next evening, the 10th guy (the richest) didn't show up. the 9 others sat down, drank their beers without him. But when the Bill arrived, they noticed that they didn't have enough money to pay even half of the Bill...

The moral of this story dear redditors:
our tax system is fairly complicated, we don't really try to understand the numbers, but none of us should forget that for the rich are the ones that help the machine turn. So stop screaming against the rich, stop asking to tax just the others, drink a bear and enjoy it!

I know that I have basically no chance to change your mind on the basic political topic (and I must say that I doubt you'll be able to change mine) because we both already have an opinion (and a rather fixed one). But by opposing our arguments, making valid, argumented points on the subject, we might help people that are still undecided in their opinion building.
But if your comments are directed to hurt, to be violent, to insult; the people around, that will read us, won't appreciate what you're saying, won't get the point, they will probably turn to the people that sound the most rational, and listen to them, because they have someting to say. That is exactly why I was trying to give you an external view on how to communicate with people. 
But you can totally continue to insult everybody, and feel superior. it's just not making a valid point, nor behaving as the ""educated person"" you claim to be.
by the way, in my definition, insulting people is just offensive, making a comment which isn't constructive it's called trolling (I did it on this subject too (with my short post) because not being constructive is fun ;)

null,false,PinkieDerpyPie,null,null,null,"To potentially save on shipping costs, you may want to consider a package service like [Swiss Paket](http://www.swiss-paket.de/). I have never used them before, but I know there is one located in Rheinfelden DE. The way it works is that you ship your goods to them, and then go pick them up yourself. *You* then bring them over the border yourself. This way you don't need to pay for shipping to Switzerland.

Regarding customs and VAT: I am not sure about the details, but as far as I know anything below CHF 300 can be imported tax free, and everything above must be declared at customs. I have no idea if you need to pay and customs fees for this purchase if you order it online and it gets shipped to your doorstep!

- If you are below CHF 300, the way it usually works is that you get a stamp at the customs office. If you then go to the store you bought the item from and present them with your receipt, the form you got at the shop and the stamp they will give you back the German VAT in cash. Some online shops offer to sell you items with 0 VAT so you do not need to go to their shop to get the money back.

- If you are above CHF 300 and go to customs to declare your purchases, you do not need to pay the ~18% German VAT, but only the ~8% Swiss VAT, so at least you can save 10% on VAT.

Now, regarding your purchase from this store, I think it is best to just call them up and ask them how they would handle VAT.",null,0,null,1431457999,null,0,false,0,cr6w27d,null,t3_35pztl,null,t1_cr6w27d,null,t3_35pztl,null,null,null,1433024852,null,2,false,SwissBuyers,t5_386fz,2,null
null,false,mobus,null,null,null,"I'll try to answer all these points: 

1: adjust from the lack of revenue from the wealthy: 
I have to say, that I don't really catch how this part of your answer respond to my particular comment, but, yes if the rich were to go (in an other country with lower taxes pex, government would probably have to either : 
A limit governmental budget (cut sprendings). 
B rise taxes(on people, enterprises, goods) to put up with the losses. 
C be in deficit and let the debt rise. 
sadly : 

A: rather unusual (I wouldn't be against it personnaly) but it would mean the diminution of lots of government spendings (welfaire system, etc), yes the army would probably also suffer, but it is only 10% of the federal budget. We shouldn't forget that the cantons would suffer the most (because they touch the taxes on the fortune) and they have no army to throw out.

B: rise taxes : just for the entreprises isn't the solution, they would probably leave too, so individuals : but the ones that can't really go, so just more poor peoples.

C is actually not the best option because of the globalised world we live in, the people that would lend money to the government wouldn't lend us money undeterminely, and, once a certain level is atteigned you have to devaluate your national money (to pay less to the people (rich and middle class) that borrowed you money) sadly that also has an influence on the general prices of goods in the country (because we live in a globalised world). so yes, not the best.

so yes, loosing the richest in this country would do us no good on a taxation level (without speaking the wealth they create, by creating jobs (lots of people in luxus industry and services).
see the situation of france trying to forbid their fortunes to leave the country.


2: buying government.  In switzerland ?? you really think our grey faded member of the federal council are bought off ?? 
Well, you may be right, no actual proof that bribery is still a thing, but I'm sure that the country would benefice if you were to give us (to the press ? the people) real proof (or at least a way to look in). Entreprises have a role to play with governmental and parlemental work, legislation drafts, and so on, so have worker unions, left wing parties, consumer associations. If you think that some laws shouldn't pass, go ahead, draft a referendum, it's fairly easy.


3: majors cuts in military spending
well, military isn't that big in switzerland, and spending less would mean less money for the auxiliary work the military does for the authorities: in case of big manifestations, emergencies, disasters and so on. money that someone would have to find somewhere else...


4: army being counter intuitive
I can't agree with you, defending one's population has always meant (still today in the irak, afganistan conflict) being able to defend the population against the destruction, the rapes, the burglaries the horrors that any other power would do if they were to enter the  country (because yes the threats exist, we live 40h away from syria by car, we sit on the largest water reserve in europe, and are quite privilegied on an economical level). so yes, I believe that the necessecity of an army is and probably always will be there. 
even if it is only to come to help the civil authorities in cases of catastrophies : when the firemens or the police can't help, because they don't have enough people for enought time (after 36 hours uninterupted of any police mission (with people needed all the time) the army will be called in, to provide mens and help.


4: a circle where the countries would fight to win the rich people over. 
yes : they will, and it is the goal, we live in a free world, in a free market, which can be called capitalism (neo-liberalism for certain peoples) with a welfare system, which means that we tend to the poors... what swizerland does (we might not do enough but we do some if not plenty).
the only way you could change the system would be : 

A : forbid certain peoples - that have commited no crime other than having worked all their lives (like the ancien boss of UBS wo began with an apprentisship (lehre/apprentissage)) or that have the chance to have had parents/ancestors that did the same - to leave the country: held them prisonner in a way, which is constitutive in my opinion of a auritarian state, a dictature.

or B : change the system, make the revolution and get us out of the capitalist system, sadly the last experiment has gone rogue... and some argue that they had it in their gene, in the exact theory of the system.
