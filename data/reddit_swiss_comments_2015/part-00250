Their commentary on many sports events is insightful and relevant (maybe not football, then again everyone who watches football thinks they're Soccer Jesus Born Again and everyone else ""Has no clue about football"" so it's hard to get a discussion going) and I'm happy that we are getting good coverage of a variety of sports.
