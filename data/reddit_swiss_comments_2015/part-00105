Learning Swiss German from a course either online or in a sort of school is difficult to impossible. The reason for this is that there's so many different dialects out there and there's neither grammar rules nor orthography that you can apply to any of them other than *There is no such thing as the temporal form known as Präteritum*. Sometimes, dialects vary from village to village, only kilometers apart. A good example here is the word *Moon*. In standard German, it's *Mond* and it's also that in some dialects. However, they range from *Ma* to *Manat* to *Manneschi*. Other words are similar, but different from dialect to dialect. A *small piece* of cheese can be known as *schnafel*, *schnifel*, *schnufel* or *schnüfeli*. 

As for Duolinguo's German: I've had a look at their placement test and that seems quite solid. They appear to have some issues regarding idioms such as demanding a literal translation for *That's neither here nor there* as opposed to the idiomatic one, but other than that, it works fine, I'd say.

I'd still recommend going to learn it at some kind of school, because languages are a living thing and should be treated as such. When doing the Duolinguo, I felt as if I was more a consumer of a language rather than interacting with it. So while I'm not trying to divert you from using it, I recommend going to classes as well.

It's not that simple, sorry to say. Take it from me who is in a similar boat as you. Regardless of your Swiss status the simple fact that you are a US citizen means that in the eyes of all Swiss financial institutions and the US Government, you are American. So it's not just about making X amount and being/not being taxed on it.

Financial institutions will treat you as an American. Everything is done through a specialized ""U.S Team"", you will be denied certain privileges (example: In Switzerland you don't pay capital gains tax- but as a US citizen you will- regardless of where/how you made that money). You will have to report every single asset you own in Switzerland and whether you pay taxes on it or not will most likely be done through a specialized accountant you pay hundreds/thousands of CHF for.

You'll soon realize it's not so much about the money but the paperwork and red tape. I have to list every single trip I made to the U.S. and what was the nature of the trip. My banks report all my transactions to the IRS, not only those, but also those of my wife who is not a US citizen.

Anywhere between Geneva and Lausanne is stunning http://www.lavaux-unesco.ch/data/dataimages/upload/ambianceHome6.jpg 

But if you want to go to an ""off the beaten path"" area, then I HIGHLY recommend camping/hiking around La Dole in Vaud. http://goo.gl/5UJH92 This is on the Jura mountains. When you get to this small chalet/restaurant it is completely surrounded by wilderness (forests, creeks and such, and a great view of Lake Geneva), and you can climb to that ball on the mountain in about 40 minutes, and 20 minutes back down. I've camped there many times and it's beautiful especially when you walk through those cow fields and through the forest. Find a clearing and pitch a tent. Just be aware of boars. I've never seen one but you'll definitely see the tracks they leave
Edit:St Cergue is beautiful too. St Cergue is amazing so you could just stay in that region and go in the plentiful forest. If you do go there, go to Rando Burger, best Burger in Switzerland imo. Also while you hike you'll probably randomly encounter a refuge to eat and drink so that's nice. Really the whole Jura mountain is beautiful because it's not high enough to be full of snow all year, instead you just have nature at its finest.
If you have any question about the French speaking part of Switzerland just ask :)

I made the directions from the closest town. It's on the way up to La Dole as mentioned above. Basically it's a nice little lake/pond in the woods, and if you go up through the woods from there by foot, and follow the river up you'll get to a place I like to call ""paradise"".

We use Puppet for configuration management on physical and virtual nodes and we have Openstack in deployment for our own cloud. 

Due to this we end up in a situation where everyone in several groups could technically fall under the devops role. Managing their boxes, (virtual) recovering them if possible, else killing them and bringing up a new one. 

Contracts are a strange area at CERN. The idea of the organisation is primarily to  give back to the Member States by welcoming their people for a few years, training them, and sending them back with the skills to go far in their field.

Yes, we have permanent members of staff but it's not easy to get that. Generally people stay for 5 years and then leave. There's no extension possible, either you get a permanent post or leave.",null,0,null,1426886172,null,0,false,0,cplf6aa,null,t3_2zphxz,null,t1_cplf6aa,null,t1_cpletwr,null,null,null,1427881284,null,1,false,CERN,t5_2r692,1,null
