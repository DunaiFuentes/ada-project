First of all, no worries about Antibiotics, food colouring and moral hazards like factory farming. And I stand by my opinion that a decent cut fresh from a market car, prepared with a bit stronger spices / marinades than you'd put on Argentinian or even Japanese beef, then sealing it correctly and baking it on low heat, makes a deliciously tasty and juicy steak that to me tastes absolutely great. I also love cheap cuts like ragout meat - the soup stock you get from this in a Pot au Feu is really something else - IMO the low fat, muscular, non watered down meat you get there is just a few notches better for these kinds of dishes.

maybe their cheapest models:

* tout-terrain
* patria

* velotraum
* thorn

these are brands you can trust. because bikes are systems that have enough aspects to hide low-quality components to the untrained eye, trustworthy brands is something I value a lot. last time I was advising someone, they ended up buying a VSF Fahrradmanufaktur, which I couldn't quite decide if they were good or not, but their price was appealing and the customer chose it. result: fork is crooked, shop is in France, customer has a busy life, can't solve it.

slightly less classy but very relevant with a 2000 CHF budget:

* simpel

if you realistically want answers, ask/look for info in dedicated forums/subreddits. if you speak DK, D or F, look in these languages rather than English (US market is not really valid here).

an alternative to a trailer would be a longjohn-type cargo bike. when the kids grow up, you/they can still use the bike to haul stuff, or you can sell it.
