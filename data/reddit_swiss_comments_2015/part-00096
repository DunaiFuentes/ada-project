Summary: CERN hopes to find dark matter this year with its refitted LHC, which can produce beams powerful enough to melt a car.

By Liam Tung | Mar 12, 2015

Nearly two years after CERN shut its Large Hadron Collider (LHC) down for repairs, scientists are once again gearing up to smash particles inside the chilly 27km ring - only this time with enough energy to blitz one tonne of copper.

The LHC's three-year ""season two"", as CERN calls it, will begin later this month with super-charged equipment and injectors capable of producing 13 tera-electron-volt (TeV) energy collisions, nearly double the 8 TeV that was possible in 2012 when CERN researchers discovered the Higgs boson quantum particle.

Inside the Large Hadron Collider: How IT powers the greatest experiment in history

While the LHC has produced one Higgs boson particle, the researchers are hoping the more powerful LHC, which is capable of producing one billion collisions per second, will increase the chances of creating Higgs bosons during collisions and thus provide more opportunities to compare experiments with the Standard Model of particle physics.

After all, there could be an entire family of Higgs boson particles that weren't discoverable with the less powerful collider.

And, if nature is kind, the collisions may also present a chance to look at dark matter.

However, at a press launch for the refitted LHC, CERN scientists warned it could take two decades to find dark matter.

""We don't know if we're going to find dark matter this year.

We don't know.

We want to find out what nature has in store for us and it could be that dark matter is in a place where we can start to produce it and see it this year.

Or it could be that we'll only really start to see signs of it with more years of data. It could be it'll take us 20 years,""

said Dave Charlton, a spokesperson for the ATLAST experiment at CERN.

Still, there are hopes a more powerful collider will bring new discoveries.

The advantage of more energy can be explained by Einstein's famous equation E=MC2.

""This says that mass is equivalent to energy.

If you want to produce a new state of matter that has a certain mass, then you need to have the energy to produce it.

Until now, we have not found things like dark matter or other evidence of new particles which go beyond the Standard Model.

Having higher energy allows us to access a new mass regime,""

CERN physicist and head of Compact Muon Solenoid, Tiziano Camporesi, said.

The more powerful LHC is also expected to generate tonnes of data.

In 2012, the LHC was generating one petabyte a second when it was in operation.

However, CERN only kept a fraction of that, amounting to a still hefty 30PB of data a year (roughly 1.2 million Blu-ray discs).

Answering a question from ZDNet, Charlton said the new LHC will produce about five times more data than its predecessor, while the LHC's detectors will pick up twice as much data, requiring a tough compression regime.

Camporesi however added that CERN wasn't using ""brute force"" to cope with the data explosion, adding the centre wouldn't need an ""exponential increase in computing power"".

Besides boosting its energy capacity, CERN has also hardened the LHC with new magnets, equipment to produce higher energy and narrower beams, improved cryogenics, radiation-resistant electronics and a more secure vacuum to accelerate particles through.

Given the near total refit of the LHC, CERN isn't rushing to fire up its first particle collisions, in part because the more powerful LHC has the potential to melt a car.

The first collisions are expected to begin by June after more testing.

""This is nearly a new machine,"" said CERN's director general, Rolf-Dieter Heuer.

""You have to remember that during the shutdown we opened the machine essentially every 20 metres, all connections between the magnets were inspected, 30 percent of the connectors were redone.

A 100 percent of these 10,000 connectors have been reinforced to be rock stable, even if the magnets move as they cold to warm or the other way around.""

""You need to be very careful about switching on high power lasers, so to speak, because it has enough power to could melt 500kg of copper - each beam, both beams together, one tonne of copper. Actually, we don't want to do that,"" said Heuer.

Safety at the LHC has been improved with extra safety valves fitted along the collider, which can be used to release excess pressure from the liquid helium that is used to cool the superconducting magnets.

You make it, we break it: CERN's particle smashers list their toughest tech challenges

Those magnets along the ring help boost the energy of particles that travel along two separate tubes with a seriously powerful vacuum that, according to CERN, stronger than the vacuum between Earth and the moon.

The superconducting electromagnets are chilled to ‑271.3°C to remove the resistance of materials as they pass through.

Another safety feature added were 27,000 new shunts that were placed on 10,200 high-current splices - the superconducting interconnections - that sit between magnets on the LHC.

The shunts will provide an alternate pathway for the 11,000-amp current to pass in the event of a fault.

CERN today released a video detailing the unusual conditions of doing maintenance work in the tunnel, which at its lowest point is 180m below the earth's surface and has a narrow path for workers to navigate its circumference.

But because access points to the 27km tunnel are 3km apart, engineers would ride bikes between points, which of course meant finding parking space for them too.

New radiation-resistant electronics were installed in the LHC to replace components that suffered wear and tear from radiation caused by previous collisions.

Scientists at CERN are aiming to generate collisions at 13 TeV by the end of May or early June after an initial run at circulating beams of proton in the week beginning 23 March.

This follows a trial last Saturday running proton beams through a 10km segment of the ring, marking the first activity since the LHC shutdown.

&amp;gt; not parking the car straight enough etc (usual Swiss things)

I have an acronym for situations like this - **M**other **F**ucking **S**wiss. I love/hate these people. 

You park a bit crooked, but still inside the lines, and the neighbors call the police? **MFS**

You're training for a triathalon, cycling top speed, and get passed by a man in a suit on a mountain bike? **MFS**

A (rare) homeless man hits you up for change, and it turns out that he speaks 5 languages? **MFS**

You're meeting friends in a strange town and your phone dies, so you ask in bars and hotels whether you can use theirs, and every single person looks at you like an alien; they can't even comprehend the level of disorganization that would result in an unexpectedly dead phone, and all refuse you help, thinking it must be some kind of trick? **MFS**

You're applying for an apartment with a garden, and ask if you can plant in it too. You know, some tomatoes, a pumpkin, whatever. The Corbusier-looking mother fucker sucks his teeth and then finally says ""perhaps... if you can prove geometrically that these plants would be elegant additions to the overall theme of the space."" **MMMFFFFSSSS**

Climbing a terrifying ridge and get passed by a heavily pregnant woman, annoyed at your slowness. **MFS**

Use the bones from your chicken to make stock and get greeted with confused scorn. What is this guy, *poor*? **MFS**

Edit: I've been collecting these. 

Referred to, depending on the language, as either a *foreigner* or a *stranger*. Ask to be called an *immigrant*, which carries far less stigma. Whoa, PC police! Fucking foreigners tell us how to speak? Forget it. **MFS**

Hear about a bar, which used to be cool, but is now ""filled with students and foreigners"". OH, you mean people like me? **MFS**

Fire needs to be lit / shed needs to be built / any physical task needs to be done properly? ""Ask the Canadian"". **MFS**

The bar closes at 12:00. At 11:55 the bartender announces last call, at 11:59:59 the last patron leaves the door, and at 12:00:01 the police appear. **MFS**

You hike up to a high alpine cabin. The other (swiss) climbers, in perfect unison, and *without talking about it*, sit down to eat, consume their bread, soup, and cheese in the same order, start their ovomaltine together, finish at the same time, go in shifts to brush their teeth, and, *in total synchronicity* hit the sack at precisely 10:00. The next day, without alarms, every person steps out of bed at 6:00, eats breakfast, and is gone by 7:00. You hang out until noon to soak up the incredible scenery and the sole staff member subtly mocks your hiking plans with his eyebrow and tone. ""Ze col de la Forcla in *zose* boots!?"" &amp;lt;utterly scandalized expression&amp;gt; **MFS** 

You: We should get moving if we're going to catch that train. **MFS**: What? Why? The train leaves in 13 minutes and it's only a 7 minute walk, or 9.5 if you stop to buy cigarettes. 

Hey, can I talk to you about a trip to Canada in January? You: Ok, it's a bit early for flights and stuff but it pays to think in advance I suppose... wait.... January of what year? **MFS**: 2015. 

Swiss boss: Let's meet at the hotel in Munich (300 km away) at 8:25 pm. *And we did*. 

You buy some ""lard"" (smoked bacon, meant to be eaten uncooked) at the farmer's market. It's good raw, but you want to try it fried. Your co-worker smells it from his office, suspects what you're up to, and bursts into the kitchen yelling ""You cannot DO zis!"" **MFS**

The used bike is 485 francs. I offer 400. Long stare. ""My price, I think, reflects the *actual* quality of the frame, components, and labor."" **MFS**

I'm from Canada, have you been? ""Oh, on a small trip, I spent one month by bicycle in Quebec, and then bought a motorhome and drove to vancouver - what a long drive! I loved the open prairies - and then sold the motorhome and spent the next weeks skiing. Whistler was nice but I prefer Chamonix for the *après ski* culture. Tell me, is the climbing in Squamish as good as they say? And how do you compare Big White with Whistler? And do you prefer New York, Montreal, or San Francisco? I found things to love about each place."" I... I, uh, I've never been to any of those places. **MFS**

People on the train begin to grumble and get exasperated. I look at my watch: we're 3 minutes late. **MFS**
