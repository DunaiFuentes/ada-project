Go for a drive in Italy within a city (the motorways are usually decent) and see the difference for yourself. There IF they do it (which is not a given) they just sit on a truck and a guy on it throws hot asphalt in the pot holes. Of course it's not the normal asphalt so after a few months the hole is dug again. The roads are not level either. 

In Switzerland, they close down the whole road, cut out a piece of asphalt, put in the new one, put the black glue to connect it and prevent new holes (you can usually see those black lines on the roads or at train stations) etc. 
and it's all pricey. 

Maybe there's a middle ground that would work better. 
Still, the A2 is used by so many vehicles that my canton is sentenced to driving on a constant construction site regardless.

So, you'll have to get a bus from the front of the airport into Basel, the bus takes you straight to the main station in Basel. Finding the bus shouldn't be an issue, the airport is small and there should be plenty of signs. Just ask someone if you're terribly confused.

When off the bus, go to any ticket machine (easy to use, select any language) or go to a counter. Buy a ticket to the city you want to go to, as simple as typing in the name or asking.

Using your phone, open SBB and put in your current location (Basel SBB) to your destination. Let's say Luzern, put that in and make sure it's the plan 'Luzern' option, no other words attached. Hit 'Search Connection' and then look at the highest option, maybe choose one with a shorter journey time.
