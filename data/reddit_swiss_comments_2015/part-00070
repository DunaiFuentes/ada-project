Why wouldn't you buy a car?

The public transportation in Switzerland is getting worse each year and more expensive. Even with Halb-Tax (which is not actually half price in many transportation companies) it's still extremely expensive. Also paying more than 2k each year for a GA is just completely crazy, considering that the trains are always filled with people during the time that you need to go to work and you might not even have a proper seat.

As for the cars in Switzerland, there are plenty of European cars (obviously) around here. People buy lots of Renaults, VW and FIATs for their method of transport to work and they usually buy a bigger car for family trips, while keeping a smaller one for work.

I have Netflix for 18 CHF a month (4 people watching at the same time @4K), but then there are series which are HBO exclusive, some are only on Amazon Prime, and others you can not even get on any video streaming service in the EU or US.

So I switched to Plex, setup CouchPotato and SickRage and get every movie and series I want, independent of the publisher. I continue paying for Netflix to feel better, since I only pay for Plex and all other services (Couchpotato and Sickrage) are free. But I will continue watching movies over Plex, even if they are on Netflix, because Plex just does a way better job with its service (design, speed and control).

Though I think I will take your advice and enjoy the mountains. I appreciate the offer and will definitely let you know about couch surfing- I would definitely enjoy getting to know people from the area. Though, I am traveling with my girlfriend (we are both 22). 

I will get back to you later as I am at work! Thank you!
