null,false,DeepDuh,zh,Zürich,null,"welcome, Sir. Btw. about my 'a few billion dollars spare' statement, I just had an idea how someone with that kind of money could actually change things.

Step 1) Lobby *every congressman*. Completely offset the money spent by other lobbying groups. Support *every campaign*.

Step 2) As a condition for your support, have these simple rules: 

(a) The future/current congressman/woman may not under any circumstance accept any other money. 

(b) His/her campaign is to come completely from her/his own ideas about how to better the nation. You provide no guidance whatsoever. If (s)he doesn't have any ideas, pay her/him *not* to run for office. 

(c) Once in Office, you lobby them all to *follow through with what they ran under in their campaign*, to a T. Again, offset every other lobbying effort. 

Step 3) Once the congress is under your 'control' (control that you now have in fact delegated to the voter), have a *single* law prepared, that will come from you rather than from congress. This law says: ""All contributions to campaigns for citizen running for congress are now illegal. Political advertisement using motion pictures (TV, movies, animated internet ads..) are now illegal. Each citizen running political campaigns can request a federal budget for print materials, travel expenses and rent of townhalls. Failure to comply results in immediate and lifelong termination of current and future public office positions for this citizen, as well as a penalty payment of 10x what was received as contribution or payed for motion picture ad."" Bribe every congress member to support this law, e.g. by providing lifelong high paying jobs at one of your companies. As a bonus payment (after they leave congress) they may receive double the amount of campaign money that they would have otherwise received for running one electoral campaign.

Ich weiss nicht wie du zu dem Rückschluss kommst, aber das ist nicht worüber ich spreche. Ich bin bereit das später zu klären. Mein Post besagte, dass die Schweiz die totale Scheisse ist, weil man dort lokale Gepflogenheiten (z.B. Bankgeheimnis) über das Wohl aller stellt in dem man wissentlich hinterzogenes Geld anlegen lässt.
Das ist ekelhaft und würden es alle machen, gäbe es die Schweiz nicht.
Belgien könnte ja Sex mit Kindern als Nationaldoktrin einführen und von dirt könnte jemand legal Kinderpornos verkaufen...das wäre genauso scheisse wenn auch gesamtwirtschaftlich wahrscheinlich weniger schädlich als die Schweiz.

Du bist ein Reflex-Schweizer, weil du verweigerst dich dem Thema zu stellen und erstmal bescheibst was alle anderen falsch machen: ich fände anprangern gut, andere Länder machen auch was böses, Bankgeheimnis ist unsere ""Kultur"". Alles in allem finde ich die Schweiz hochnotpeinlich und im speziellen die Bevölkerung! Die Politiker sind ja viel sympatischer als deutsche Politiker oder Schweizer. Hans Rudolph Merz ist der Hammer!
Das alles rechtfertigt aber nicht ansatzweise wissentlich sich am Betrug zu laben und genau das tut die Schweiz und genau deswegen finde ich die Schweiz mege scheisse. Es ist mir kack egal ob Bankgeheimnis oder Beschneidung von Mädchen die Kultur in der Schweiz ist...wenn die Mehrheit der Welt es beschissen findet, hat die Mehrheit der Welt recht. Und ich habe die 90% nich schreien hören: oooh, macht mal mehr Bankgeheimnisse damit es leichter wird Geld zu verstecken.

Lass uns da drüber reden. Wie findest du sollen die Opfer der schweizer Politik damit umgehen? Z.B. deutsche HartzIV Empfänger denen die Kommunen kaum Geld geben können weil die Großverdiener des Kreises hinterziehen? Oder wie sollen die Kinder sich fühlen, deren KITA keine Ausrüsting kriegt weil die Kommune keine Steuereinnahmen hat weil die größten potentiellen Steuerzahler sich in der Schweiz in Sicherheit wiegen?

There should actually be a small plaque on most fountains that says whether the water is safe to drink. In the ones that are safe to drink from, the water is *not* recycled from the basin. I showed an American friend around my city once, he was very skeptical that they were safe to drink from, understandably since that's not a thing in America. Of course water fountains exist in America, they just look very different and are rarely on the street.
