* Could you direct me to the article that states that handguns are excluded from the antique gun laws?
* So you're saying I don't need to tell the federal authorities whether or not the gun was registered, but I DO have to tell the canton? Will the federal government ask?
* Does ProTell have a phone number I can call? I can't seem to find one on the website.

Your help is greatly appreciated!

I'm currently at work, I will just gradually post some links so they're saved and then expand from there.

This is a summary of the law itself which I posted earlier. In this summary you will find the two numbers you need from the authorities.

Federal export control authority:
Tel. +41 31 324 84 86

And the cantonal firearms bureau from the relevant canton.

You might be lucky, I didn't find the exemption for handguns in the actual law, only in different FAQs and similar. 

Edit: ProTells number is +41 61 723 28 03, their e-mail is sekretariat(at)protell.ch

Pretty sure they will know about the handgun exemption.

Edit: I would first contact the canton before you contact federal authorities. Make sure you're the legal owner and that it's registered beforehand.
The ""Waffenregister"", firearms registry, is managed by cantonal authorities. Pretty sure for export you will have to grant the federal authorites permission to get your information from the cantonal firearms registry, but everything else is not their business. It's not that big of a deal really, but we're pretty adamant about who gets to know what in Switzerland :-)

Edit 2: Can't link directly but I got the exemption from the FAQ from one of the largest gun shops, they're usually spot on with this type of stuff, but your cantonal firearms bureau (from the first link. You can alternatively tell me the canton and I will get you the contact info) will have the last word on that. The FAQ is here https://www.gunfactory.ch/div/faq.htm
I can't link directly to the question but it's the one that says ""brauche ich einen wes für gebrauchte oder für sammler-waffen?""",null,0,null,1424876978,null,0,1424878844,0,cowpmhr,null,t3_2wv4lx,null,t1_cowpmhr,null,t1_cowl29x,null,null,null,1427447598,null,1,false,SwissGuns,t5_2wug1,1,null

Couldn't tell you how each of them is, though. A 1-year membership seems to cost between CHF 900-1,100.

May I ask on what type of  exchange you're here? If it's for study and you're at a university or a university of higher education, it's possible that you're already an ASVZ member (academic sports association) or can become one quite cheaply (CHF25 per semester). It's for university students and staff, and as a member you can use their gyms (which there are a lot at the different campuses in Zurich, even one in Winterthur I think) and take part in numerous classes and courses for free.
