&gt; **The GINI index measures the degree of inequality in the distribution of family income. In Switzerland it is 28.70 while in The United States it is 45.00.**

&gt; This index measures the degree of inequality in the distribution of family income in a country. The index is calculated from the Lorenz curve, in which cumulative family income is plotted against the number of families arranged from the poorest to the richest. The index is the ratio of (a) the area between a country's Lorenz curve and the 45 degree helping line to (b) the entire triangular area under the 45 degree line. The more nearly equal a country's income distribution, the closer its Lorenz curve to the 45 degree line and the lower its Gini index, e.g., a Scandinavian country with an index of 25. The more unequal a country's income distribution, the farther its Lorenz curve from the 45 degree line and the higher its Gini index, e.g., a Sub-Saharan country with an index of 50. If income were distributed with perfect equality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the 45 degree line and the index would be zero; if income were distributed with perfect inequality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the horizontal axis and the right vertical axis and the index would be 100.

In the U.S the dentist/optometrist/doctor will run your insurance before the procedure and let you know what may/may not be covered. Here they provide the service and then you pay upfront and pretty much have to cross your fingers hoping that the insurance company covers it.

For example, I went to the dentist and the dentist recommended I get x-rays done to check my wisdom teeth. I pay the huge bill and submit it to the insurance company. A month later I get my reimbursement and see that x-rays won't be covered because the insurance company didn't think they were necessary. This was the same case with my eye exams. I merely took all the exams the optometrist sat me through and now the insurance company says I got unnecessary tests done so they won't cover it.
