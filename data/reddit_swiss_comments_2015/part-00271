are you traveling to Switzerland? It seems like parts of your post have gone missing.

It's not really a problem to have 4 languages, one is barely spoken and they're regional. That means when I go out of the house and wander around in my city I don't have to be able to speak several languages to get around.

People that live close to the language borders are usually bilingual.

We have several TV and radio stations for each of the languages. That might be a bit complicated. Products are usually labeled in two or three languages, websites are translated in three or four languages (English).

In general there is a relatively high tolerance of each other's languages. National politicians speak several languages and press conferences are sometimes interesting because the reporters can ask questions in any language and the politicians might respond in another language, but usually we try to adapt to each other.

Would it be easier to have just one language? Of course it would be, but we would lose some of our identity and who wants that? We're fine with the situation like it is now. It's possible that with more and more young people being able to speak English the language barrier will be bridged with English instead of adapting to the other language.

In practice, everyone can speak 1 or 2 or more other languages (even though some aren't very good with other national languages--looking at you, Suisse Romande lol). 

In my family, we speak at least two languages in daily conversations, and sometimes up to 4 (although not perfectly, as you can imagine, but enough for what we need).

My experience of crossing the language barrier in Switzerland is:

Most Swiss Germans will know enough French to get by.

Most Swiss French (I am one of them) will know a little bit of German, but since the Swiss Germans speak French, we don't have to make as much of an effort. :) It doesn't help that the German we learn in school has a different pronunciation than the German that's spoken in Switzerland, so it's easier for a Swiss German to use his high school French with a French-speaking Swiss, than for a French-speaking Swiss to use his high school German with a Swiss German.

Italian-speaking Swiss usually know enough French AND German to be able to communicate.

The fourth language, Romansh, is isolated. Those people can be grouped together with the Swiss Germans as far as functional language knowledge is concerned.

There are cases when different languages can be confusing. Example:

I am taking a train from Lausanne to Geneva. In the train station, I look for signs that say ""Genève"", which is Geneva in French. The signs in the train station in Lausanne will be in French.

Then, a few days later, I am taking a train from Zürich to Geneva. This time, I have to look for signs that say ""Genf"", which is Geneva in German. The signs in the train station in Zürich will be in German.

One day, I take a trip to beautiful Bellinzona. I decide to take the train back to Geneva. This time, I have to look for signs that say ""Ginevra"", which is Geneva in Italian. The signs in the train station in Bellinzona will be in Italian.

But if you're driving, all road signs are pictures, not words like in the USA, so you don't have to worry about reading road signs.

Here are what the road signs look like. Don't worry, you're not supposed to know every single one of them!

The Blick-article you posted is from September 2005 and even includes cases where the deed was done by females or it wasn't clear what happened. You kindly excluded all those in your post, just so you could make claims such as ""Dabei ist auffällig, dass in der Schweiz **immer** der Mann die Frau angreift oder mordet."" Not to mention that there is a marginal difference between ""attacking"" and ""killing"", and the article only covers the latter. You may want to check the statistics and official estimates on domestic violence ( ""Häusliche Gewalt"" ) by the government, cantons and independent aid orgainisations - or not, because they'd disagree with you and your selection bias. 

If you truly ""followed the sick shit going on in that area"" you'd realize that the state and its organisations (Police, KESB, asylums, OHG etc) are mostly there as a cleanup crew when people are incapable of not hurting one another (both physical and psychological). In a second step they are left with the thankless task of figuring out the answer to ""How can we prevent the shit from hitting the fan without fucking up the child?"". 

In Switzerland, the default decision for child custody is that it is **split between both parents**. If for some reason only one parent has custody, the other one fucked up severely. ""He/She set me up!"" is the default bullshit excuse of everyone who lost ever, most of the time what they mean is ""I don't believe the court has the authority to label my terrible life decisions as such and thus declare me an unfit parent!"". Courts need evidence, if it's word against word it will default to the shared custody and it will be closely monitored in case one parent truly is as shit as the other claims. That's usually not the case and everyone wasted their time because people are assholes. 

Child support is a difficult terrain to navigate (and parliament is currently discussing some major changes) but people have to remember that having a kid is a financial commitment for ~20 years, and an emotional commitment for a lifetime. 
Currently it works like this: the paying parent is guaranteed a minimal living standard while the recieving parent is not - they are the one that usually have to go for social help. Social help has to be paid back in full once the (former) reciever has started earing some more money, so it's a loan from the state and not ""yay free money from the taxpayer"", which is very wearing on everyone involved. 

tl;dr many people don't know the hows and whys of the system, yet they point at random events and proclaim its utter and complete failure. While it's *far* from perfect, those people have yet to agree on something that would work better just in theory, let alone withstand the test of the real world.

maybe you are not very aware of the very unprofessional procedures of the KESB (and police and all other very bad authorities making money with family problems). Check out this case: http://redd.it/3ccltk - it is very common for the KESB to exploit any incoming case with bad financial interest and caring a shit for the welfare of children. Countless children have been trapped into custody against laws, against their will and without caring for their future at all. Take also a look into this cases: [""Auf der Flucht"" vor der KESB / Schweiz - wenn staatliche Behörden zur Mafia werden](http://redd.it/33qkjm) - obviously criminal action against a mother (in this case) and only the intervention of SVP-Nationalrat Pirmin Schwander and direct threat with criminal investigation against the KESB stopped them. 

Your term 'cleanup crew' is a good description to them being near to terror squads destroying families with children.
