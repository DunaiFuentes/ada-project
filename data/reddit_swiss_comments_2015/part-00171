The most spots are listed, because they are landmarks. Offcourse it depends on what you want to do. Im personally not a fan of hiking, so it would not help me if someone would recommend this.

What do you WANT to do?",null,0,null,1430981449,null,0,false,0,cr15zx4,null,t3_354w4k,null,t1_cr15zx4,null,t3_354w4k,null,null,null,1432820040,null,4,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,4,null
null,false,LethalPuppy,sg,St. Gallen,null,"If the weather is nice, you can go swim in the Rhine in Basel. There's also a quite nice old town to walk around in. But I would take the train to somewhere else if I were you. 

Interlaken is a bit of a tourist trap but the scenery is great and lots of much nicer places are accessible in very short amounts of time. If you're up for mountainous stuff, hiking etc. I can recommend you the [Niesen](http://www.niesen.ch/en/news/?oid=1845&amp;lang=en), the [Brienzer Rothorn](http://www.brienz-rothorn-bahn.ch/en/welcome.html) or, if you want to be REALLY overwhelmed by the mountains, the [Jungfrau Region](http://jungfrauregion.ch/en/Welcome). The old town of Thun is also worth a visit, or you can just take part in some of the activities the two lakes have to offer, like swimming, water skiing, wakeboarding etc.

Other cool places in Switzerland where there's a lot to do for tourists: 

* [Luzern](http://www.luzern.com/en/index.cfm)
* [Appenzell](http://www.appenzell.info/en/service-navi/home.html)
* [Valais](http://www.valais.ch/en/home)
* the [Jura](http://www.juradreiseenland.ch/en/home.html) (very underrated tourist destination IMO)
* [Zurich](https://www.zuerich.com/en#section-01)
* the whole [Lake Geneva Region](https://www.zuerich.com/en#section-01)

**Pros:** 

Lots of student friendly bars and restaurants (cheaper) since this is the University area. Good night/social life for the same reasons and close to Carouge which is also a ""cool"" part of town. Weekend market in the main square, and usually some sort of circus/fair/activity as well.

 **Cons:** 

Not as convenient as the Old Town in terms of transportation. Some sketchy parts (drug dealers/gypsies). Loud for the reasons mentioned above. Crazy drivers (motos/cars) compared to the Old City which has super narrow roads or public transport roads only.

**Vielle Ville**

**Pros:**

Fantastic transportation options : Seemingly every line to everywhere in the city along with multiple options to the Train station. Walking distance to the lake. Cleaner/""Safer"" and quieter than the rest. 

**Cons:**

More expensive. Expect a 15-20% markup on food/drinks. Can be a ghost town, and has parts where the streets aren't well lit, and not too many people would be around.
