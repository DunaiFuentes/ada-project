No, it's not. That's the only case advice is needed anyway. Satisfying customers that know what they want is easy, no staff interaction needed.

&gt; Most employees in these stores finished an apprenticeship, so saying ""They don't know shit"" is just wrong.

Of course they have finished an apprenticeship and learned how to collect money and fill up the shelves but that doesn't enable them to give sound advice to customers.

If a walk into STEG and ask for best cost/capacity S-ATA storage they'll usually immediately ask if I have S-ATA 3 compatibility or not and they'll immediately know that 2 TB disks give you the best cost/capacity ratio currently. They'll show you a list of all their disks and are able to explain to you the different characteristics of the disks available (e.g. cache size and rpm). The deal is closed in 5 minutes due to good customer support and I know exactly what I have bought and why that's the right thing for me.

Finishing an apprenticeship doesn't prepare you for these rather simple questions. The grandma who calls me over to connect her printer to her new 3000.- gamer PC she bought for reading emails has usually shopped at Media Markt, that's a recurring pattern. Good advice at Media Markt is rare. If you refuse to call that ""They don't know shit"", I'm fine with that. I don't care about the wording as long as the reader doesn't think he'll get sound advice there.

&gt; If you keep an eye out for discounts you can find some pretty sweet deals in these stores as well ;)

Would you please cite an example. There were others claiming the same and I just can't find a simple case where they underbid their competitors significantly.

&gt; Also why didn't you include Melectronics? Equal to iD in every aspect and also a major retailer.

I didn't mention Melectronics because I don't know them good enough yet. Their prices are similar, true, but the one time I shopped at Melectronics I found a Wii U Bundle that was significantly lower priced than Media Markt's offer and even lower than wog.ch. Upon buying the thing the lady at the counter even opened the package to check if everything was alright, something I never witnessed at Media Markt or Interdiscount.

I basically agree with you though, that iD, MEl and MM are not the place to go for advanced advice or to ask super detailed questions. But hey, that's what A, the internet is good for, and B we have Fachgeschäfte in CH.

You're playing definition-games with ""knows what he wants"" without being explicit what you're talking about. Explain the difference and we'll see.

&gt; Regarding prices, find me a cheaper price within Switzerland for this coffeemaker.

Accepted. I can't find that specific model anywhere else significantly cheaper. Just note that [nettoshop.ch](https://www.nettoshop.ch/Haushalt-und-K%C3%B6rperpflege/Kaffeemaschinen/Kaffeemaschine-Vollautomaten/Philips-Saeco-Minuto-One-Touch-HD8763-01-Kaffeevollautomat/p/IP052532) sells it for the same price without claiming a 50% price reduction.

&gt; I would love to see the ""gamer pc for 3k"" that Media Markt sells!

Ok, make it 2k. I can't show you that model because it was years ago. However, it doesn't really matter. If a customer tells you ""I need a computer just to read email"" and you're selling them something above 1k you're just exploiting their ignorance.

&gt; Oh and by the way, grandma didn't know what she wanted and is now not satisfied with her purchase for 100%, because she payed 3k!

Nice morals you have there. I can assure you the grandmas become very pissed when you tell them that the Raspberry Pi for 100.- would have been enough.

&gt; Also the clerk had probably a hard time to figure out what she wanted, because she was unable to tell him that she does not need the newest graphics card etc.

If you have problems figuring out what they want in this case you're simply incompetent. It's basic knowledge that you can't ask these customers about graphic cards even though they need one. Nevertheless, a good salesman can handle this, I don't see any reason why that would be a problem.

&gt; So you see, people who don't know what they want are hard to please.

Well, if you refuse to accomodate to their technological ignorance and explain to them the necessary concepts, then yes, they'll be as frustrated as when they entered your shop. Again, a good salesman knows this.

&gt; So I guess all your negative opinions about a store are also based on ONE experience? NICE, you are perfect to give others advice!

I said it's a recurring pattern. I had multiple cases of Media Markt customers that were sold overpriced products which they clearly didn't need from the requirements they told the staff. Also I made it pretty clear on the Melectronics issue that I'm not generalizing from isolated cases.

Don't start ad hominem arguments when you run out of valid arguments, especially not when they're so obviously wrong.

The assets in a sovereign wealth fund would be exposed to the same exchange rate risk as the SNB's currency reserves; even a much higher proportion of 'real' investments such as equities would offer no protection against value fluctuations. By investing part of the currency reserves in a well-diversified range of equities and corporate bonds, the SNB is able to exploit the positive contribution of these asset classes to the risk/return profile.
