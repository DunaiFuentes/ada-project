Then it's rater quick. You go at their desk and you say you want to open a campus bank account. If memory serves, all you really need is the passport/identity card (if you aren't swiss you might also need the permit) and a certificate that shows you are enrolled at the EPFL. If you want you can also deposit money into it straight away. 

The guy will surely explain everything, you'll have to make a few choices (MasterCard or visa etc) but it's pretty straightforward.

&gt;Requirement to take out insurance

&gt;All persons domiciled in Switzerland must take out health insurance. Every family member is insured individually, regardless of age. Anyone arriving in Switzerland with the intention of staying must take out such insurance within three months. Parents are allowed the same period in which to insure their newborn children.**The basic health insurance reimburses retroactively for any health-related expenses incurred up to the time the insurance coverage began. Since expenses are reimbursed retroactively, consequently it is mandatory to pay the premiums retroactively from the beginning of coverage on.**

&gt;The insured may choose any health insurer he wants, and the insurer must accept him irrespective of his age and state of health, and without any reservations or qualifying period.

Makes sense. Health insurance is mandatory, therefore you were insured even without insurance. I guess it's a bad surprise for you now, but you would have been happy to be able to rely on it in case of an illness/injury in the last 6 months.",null,0,null,1437410523,null,0,1437410768,0,ct9uaji,null,t3_3dyfim,null,t1_ct9uaji,null,t3_3dyfim,null,null,null,1438027649,null,9,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,9,null
