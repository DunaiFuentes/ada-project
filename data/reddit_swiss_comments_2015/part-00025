Chinese supplier: like [Aliexpress](http://www.aliexpress.com) [Tinydeal](http://www.tinydeal.com) [Banggood](http://www.banggood.com)

Bought my last two cellphones directly in China and also some cheap throwaway phones. They ship mostly for free and very 'customs friendly'. ;) They are offering also mini-quadcopters and such toys, which go for a very high price here in Switzerland.

US supplier: like [ebay.com](http://www.ebay.com) [Amazon US](http://www.amazon.com/)

With help of a [parcel forwarding service](http://www.shipito.com), good can be shipped quite cheap to Switzerland. Also customs declaration is filled out by myself online (connect the dots yourself). Usually I use this for things that aren't readily available in Switzerland. So the other day I bought a microphone for 275$ + 20$ shipping, for which I only had one single source here and they offered for 650.- (plus shipping).

If you live close to the border or it's no problem for you to travel there, there is also the option that you buy from ""EU's Ebay"" and send the parcel to a location like [this](http://www.lieferadresse-konstanz.de). Then you pick it up and you're responsible for customs, when you enter Switzerland.

There is risks involved when buying goods overseas, especially when it comes to guarantee claims. I'm aware of this risks and so far, I was never disappointed or had faulty good.
