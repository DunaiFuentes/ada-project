For you maybe not, but for others maybe yes. You're not alone in this world.

They already have most of these rights, save child adoption which shouldn't be a right, unless you think humans can be objects for sale.

It does: people who think marriage is sacred. 

&gt;makes a minority happy

I'm not under the impression that marriage makes people particularly happy. Quite the contrary, actually.

Look, I get that a child is not an object, but then again if we go by that logic (and ignore that the point ""a child not being an object"" changes nothing in this discussion...), why are heterosexual couples allowed to adopt them and we're not? What's the difference? 

And not that I want to marry soon but *eventually* I'd like to have kids, and I'd love to have them legally recognized and that my partner will have the same rights and duties by law.

Lol okay. Contradictory statements here.

&gt;nothing ""sacred"" about that, just bureaucracy

So why call it ""marriage"" and make it religious, if you know it's a sensitive topic? Unless you just want to teach these filthy religious Untermensch a good lesson on tolerance, of course. 

&gt;I'm gay

Good for you. 

&gt;YOUR opinion kinda hurts

But yours hurts too--well, not me as I don't care, but religious people. You take it that it only matters when *you* are hurt. That's not how mutual respect works. 

&gt;don't bother for equality rights, you've got all you need

But you do have all you need in terms of legal rights. I don't see you hung in public, discriminated, spat upon. On the contrary, you guys seem to be able to turn on a tantrum in the form of the ""gay pride"" every year and nobody cares, neither religious people nor me. Yeah okay, you can't have children but hey, complain to God, not society. 

You're acting like spoiled kids who don't get their toy, not like a responsible person. Yes, as a gay you may hear the occasional unpleasant remark, but everyone does, I do too (just in your former message, as it happens). If unpleasant remarks are your real problem, you're lucky, believe me. 

&gt;why are heterosexual couples allowed to get them and we're not? What's the difference? 

Heterosexuals are not necessarily non-fertile. If they are, it's an accident. They still have a parental aura. Gays, on the other, cannot procreate. Sorry to state the obvious but you seem to have forgotten the basics. 

&gt;but eventually I'd like to have kids

I'd like to be able to fly and breathe underwater, but it doesn't work that way. 

&gt;I just hope that it will be once like this.

I honestly wish you the best, but 1) you can't be happy at the expense of others (even if they are people you deeply hate for being part of another group, like religious people), and 2) you'll never be happy if you set yourself impossible goals. Nature says you can't have kids, get over it. Many people think it's not okay to call it marriage and give it religious credentials: get over it and find your own thing. Bold fonts and insults won't change a thing. 

But really: If you think you can be happy by alienating others, even if they are filth to your eyes, then you'll probably never be happy--and it won't be anybody's fault. 

&gt;while it doesn't change anything for you, it means the world for others, so please don't decide just from your perspective.

It does change things for me, mind you. To know that I live in a society where children can be bought like pet animals is a big deal. To know that I live in a society that tries to deny reality for whatever egalitarian utopia is a shame. That's just giving momentum to collective neuroses. 

Perhaps you should consider the following: people like me aren't against gay marriage for fear or hate of gays; we are against it because in order to be healthy, a society needs to be able to grasp and accept reality. Excessive, beyond-nature egalitarianism is not acceptance of reality. 

You say it doesn't change a thing for me or others. Again, it does. I know you don't understand or don't care because you think you're unilaterally right, but as unpleasant for you as it is, that's a fact.

If a gay person is in the hospital in a coma or in between life and death, a person who is married has far better visitation and decisional rights than simply a friend. Even though two gay people have been together for their whole life and trust each other completely, without marriage they can't see each other in hospital, and can't participate in the decision making. That's fucking outrageous, and has to be changed. 

Other people have no right to decide who others should love or trust. You shouldn't be able to sit on your couch and vote NO, and decide on the fate of two other people. I respect if your religious, and I respect if being gay is bad to you, whatever that's your view, but you have no right to forbid **other people** from doing what they want if it doesn't actually impact you and your rights.
