null,false,Urgullibl,null,null,null,"I disagree. The reason most public shooting ranges are skeptical about civilian guns is that Army guns are about as good as it gets as far as shooting precision and mechanical quality are concerned. For example, I have shot quite a few civilian firearms, and none are even remotely as precise as a P49. Granted, my own P75 is pretty darn accurate and better than any civilian gun I've ever tried, but even that thing is nowhere near as good as a P49. Of course, the fact that the ammo is subsidized doesn't hurt either.

Another point is that people on public shooting ranges usually have a realistic approach towards firearms. You won't find people who become unduly emotional when dealing with them on those ranges, which is a very good thing.

I highly recommend OP attend the shooting festival in VS. It's a quintessential example of Swiss gun culture if there ever was one.",null,0,null,1431150019,null,0,false,0,cr3d021,null,t3_34pc1w,null,t1_cr3d021,null,t1_cqyzmns,null,null,null,1432857857,null,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2,null
