null,false,drink_your_tea,usa,engaged to a Swiss,null,"Hey there - I'm in a similar boat: pretty decent at Hochdeutsch; need a lot of exposure to Swiss German! 

For what it's worth, I hear people say ""Standarddeutsch"" instead of ""Hochdeutsch"" in Switzerland. I don't think there's anything wrong with saying Hochdeutsch, but I've started to prefer referring to it as standard rather than high (I know that it's to differentiate from Plattdeutsch, but there's obviously none of that to be found in Switzerland!) 

Now, onto your actual question-- I've found that Züritütsch is one of the easier dialects to understand if you're coming from a Hochdeutsch background - much easier than, say, Bärntütsch. On a good day, I can understand about 70% of Züritütsch. A lot of it is pattern recognition: your brain starts to realize that ""au"" (as in ""auf"") typically gets changed to ""uu"", so eventually you recognize ""uuf"" right away.

Anyway, in terms of resources: [This YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Maryangel24) is one of the best I'm aware of. Since I'm not currently living in Switzerland, it's been one nice way to get familiar with those patterns and vocab in general. Bonus: the creator speaks in Züritütsch!

There's also a book [called Hoi](http://www.amazon.com/Hoi-Swiss-German-Survival-Guide/dp/3905252139), but I haven't read it so I can't vouch for how helpful it might be.

Immersion really is best. Especially if you speak English and Hochdeutsch, it can be hard to convince people not to speak to you in one of those languages instead - when I'm in Switzerland, they usually take pity on me and revert to something that I'm more adept at. That's all fine and well, but it doesn't help me learn faster! :) So the more you can mingle and interact and make a fool out of yourself for speaking broken dialect, the faster you'll learn, and the more comfortable you'll feel. 

My (Swiss) husband knows a few foreigners who went through the Migros school, and he thinks it was overpriced given the results they got. The best thing is just to talk. *Now, if only I could convince him not to just speak in Standarddeutsch and English with me...* :)
