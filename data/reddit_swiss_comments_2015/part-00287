As for hiking [wanderland.ch](http://www.wanderland.ch) is probably the best online source for all of Switzerland. A small explanation. Each route will list the ""requirements"" and ""conditions"" which isn't particularly well translated IMO. ""requirements"" tells you how difficult the route is and more or less corresponds to the [trail type](http://www.wanderland.ch/en/mehr-wl/hiking-trail-network-and-signalization.html) (hiking trails, moutain trails, alpine routes). ""conditions"" refers to how strenuous the hike is. Unfortunately this is mostly just a measure of how long the hike is. I recommend you refer to the length and the height profile instead.

As for where to go. We have a huge network of hiking paths so chances are good that you can get a great selection of hikes whereever you end up. (Also remember that you can just take the train from your camping place and hike a bit further away). The routes on Wanderland.ch are by far not everything there is. Once you've made a selection you can often find more recommendations from more local sources like the local tourist bureau. I don't know how fit and experienced you are.

Quality of treatment should not be determined by the kind of insurance you have. With a semi private or private stay you usually have a choice of doctor, that you don't have with the basic insurance.

Also, most companies offer a  third option called FLEX. That will let you (for a an additional fee) choose the kind of ward you want upon entering the hospital and only for that stay.

* general: you're placed in standard hospital rooms.
* semi-private: you're placed in two bed hospital rooms and a senior physician (Oberarzt) is responsible for your case.
* private: you're placed in a private hospital room and a/the chief physician is responsible for your case.

**Rooms:** What's the point of the two bed option? I belive in Murphy's law so if you're concerned that you get loud, snorry or inconsiderate roommates you're chances are probably not much better in a two bed than a standard room. I've been to the hospital three times in my adult life and I was perfectly fine in the normal rooms. Everyone was respectful and I actually enjoyed having something going on during the day.

**Care:** I don't really believe that you'll get better care. What the various explanations I've heard/read say is that instead of a ""random"" doctor you'd get assigned to a senior or even the chief physician. But is that going to make much of a difference? I've seen at most anectotal ""evidence"" for that.

The only thing I think can actually make a lot of sense is to get the ""general section, whole Switzerland"" addition if your nearest hospital is in a different canton. But emergencies and stuff they can't do in your home canton don't need this addition.

0. 120k before taxes is just a bit above average for skilled IT professionals in Geneva, I would say.

1. Finding a house is much easier than an apartment. Average prices will go down soon as well, due to lots of housing being built, especially in the Meyrin district.

2. Average price for a 200 sqm house with a garden in the outskirts as advertised is roughly 6500 CHF per month. Usually you can haggle a bit and get it down to below 6000.

3. Groceries: leshop.ch - No sane competition to this.
