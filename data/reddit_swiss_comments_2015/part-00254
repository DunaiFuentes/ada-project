Referendums are serious things that need to be planned in advance and you need to take the time to formulate the issue you want to vote on in a clear and concise way (that voting ballot the Greeks are using would be better in a greek tragedy than in real life). You also need to give the people time to debate the issue, to ponder the consequences and not rush them at mach 10 through the most important decision of their lifetimes.

That people call it a testament to democracy is the insult added to the injury. It's a travesty, a sham and Tsipras should be ashamed for even thinking it up! Any Swiss politician proposing such a referendum would be sternly dismissed as a lunatic.

I'd feel pity for the Greeks were it not for the fact that this is exactly what they wanted when they elected Tsipras: Grandstanding, a lot of arrogant preaching, warm air but very little concret change. That referendum fits perfectly in that context.

So what do you think they will care about a country that's so bankrupt that it practically belongs -body and soul- to Goldman Sachs? 

Europe, Greece included, is no true democracy, and you can see it at how they use referendums: as a threat to other countries, relatively to sanctions, etc. but not for serious issues like the Transatlantic Treaty e.g., because these politicians know the people they supposedly represent don't think like them and would vote contrarily to their (very often, personal) interests and compromise their oh-so-great carreer as crooks-in-chief of the Eurozone. 

The Greeks will vote for or against Europe or the sanctions or whatever, but these gangsters (Germans, French, Greeks...) will have their ways, and this crypto-fascist, oligarchic ""Union"" will do according to the will of its only god, the market, and its ""son on earth"", money. 

And they'll tell us with a tear in their eyes that Europe was invented so that there's no more wars blah blah blah and all the usual bs that only a 4 year old would believe, while they put the cash in their pockets.
