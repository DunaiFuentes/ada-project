So let's assume this is an attempt at social engineering. There is no way it will accomplish anything. There's roughly 100 people wearing burqas in this country. Chances are, if this law passes, they will simply not be allowed out of the house. Also, since there are so few burqa wearers, the chances any of us interact with someone in a burqa in our time here is incredibly low. I don't think any reasonable person thinks there will be a positive social engineering effect here.
