I thought that was clear from the context. However, I really think that the rest is true. Ask random people on the street to which culture they look up. Or which other country they admire. People will struggle to give you an answer. Most Swiss really believe that they are better than everyone else. Most Swiss aren't even aware of this. They aren't intentionally arrogant but they just think it's normal to be rich. E.g. even people with an office apprenticeship go for long weekends to New York. In most European countries even people with university degrees can't easily afford this. With the strong Swiss franc is gets even worse. 

Also it's very common that Swiss believe that they deserve to be rich. E.g. the average office clerk certainly isn't responsible for the wealth of the country but still think it's a result of their behavior.

True but I wasn't referring to that. E.g. a lot of people get reject racist/xenophobic reasons (e.g. the ETH professor recently, google it if you haven't read it). But you aren't allowed to say that, because if 'the people' decide something in Switzerland, then it's basically holy.

&gt; which wanted to make all citizenship decisions subject to vote - it failed!

That's exactly what I mean. How is that a justification? Someone should have stood up to the people and told them that it's not okay to vote on people and reject them on stupid reasons. People here think that everything is positive as long as it was a democratic decision. But let's be honest, all of people are fucking idiots. Other countries build system where this is actually considered to basically protect the people from themselves. In Switzerland every nonsense can be written into the constitution. Or people vote for extreme things 'to send a message'. That's fucking childish. Messing with the country to send a message?! That really proofs that this is not a good solution.

Great cafes along the water. Nearby is Mt. Pilatus which we ascended by cable car after taking a bus to Kriens, then we descended by incline to the train at Alpnachstad.  We had a train pass - not too expensive for 4 days and we got a lot of use out of it.  Even though restaurants can be expensive, we offset that during the day by eating cheap from rails station stands for breakfast and lunch... or getting food at small sandwich shops or grocery stores.
