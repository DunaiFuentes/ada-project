null,false,Lejeune_Dirichelet,be,Bern,null,"You first need to understand that most cantons were separate countries for most of their history (~300-500 years). Shortly after Sonderbund war, a dispute emerged as to how the region should be governed from then on: either to follow the previous models that was nothing more than a loose confederation (a Staatenbund), or actually unify them as a country, like the French tried to do (a Bundesstaat). Eventually, the supporters of a Bundestaat won, and the federal Diet (""Tagsatzung"" is probably the better  English term ;-)) produced the federal constitution of 1848. As a compromise, the federal state was made to be extremely weak in relation to the cantons: it at first basically only administrated the federal army, foreign relations and introduced the unitary currency 2 years later (the federal tribunal, for example, was only created in the revision of the constitution of 1874).

Since then, the federal state has significantly grown in size (mainly during and after WW2), and the cantonal differences largely disapered; gone are the days where 20% difference in the results of popular votes between neighbouring cantons was considered the norm.

Another factor that has to be taken into account is the fact that the reasons behind many conflicts between the cantons rarely overlap: French/German/Italian speaking, Protestants vs Catholics and urban vs rural regions all allied themselves at different times against the others along different lines. I don't know the PKK very well, but if the disputes tend to align on the same inner borders, federalism doesn't work very well (take Belgium for example).",null,0,null,1425786226,null,0,false,0,cp7uo6g,null,t3_2ya2mh,null,t1_cp7uo6g,null,t3_2ya2mh,null,null,null,1427638866,null,9,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,9,null

Dutch is a language because they've been using the Amsterdam dialect in written form in the region for centuries. Even then, it was considered to be just a german dialect by germans, because there was no clear border between german and dutch dialects. This all changed after the world wars.

In Switzerland, no written form of any dialect, or any other standard, was able to compete with standard german. It probably helped that standard german was primarily a written language based on middle and mostly high german dialects, and as such similar to swiss german dialects, while dutch is based on a less related low german dialect.

In the end, what makes or breaks the language status is if the speakers themselfs see themselfs as speaking a seperate language. And that doesn't really seem to be the case in switzerland. We all understand standard german even before we learn it in school just through watching some tv. And the other dialects are just as weird, or weirder, than standard german. So it's not even clear what ""Swiss German"" would actually look like. Is Bärndütsch *the* swiss german, and everything else is just dialects? If you pick one dialect over another, it's not a whole lot different from what we've got going on already with standard german, and there have never been any efforts to create a common standard. For all those reasons, it's hard to argue that swiss german is more than a collection of german dialects.

But it also has some disadvantages: as was pointed in other parts of this subreddit, the current system promotes political parties to bring polarising and uncompromising initiatives that are aimed primarily at sharpening the image and values they defend in the general population. Getting them accepted is just a bonus.

Also, one of the requirements of direct democracy is to have an informed population that understands the issues he/she votes on, and the consequences of the different options given. Sadly, a ton of voters have no idea what exactly will change when they vote on an issue, what the main arguments are, etc. and tend to just make up their own (inaccurate) solution as to how a (sometimes quite technical) issue needs to be solved.

It *enables* the citizen. DDR, China, Cuba and North Korea forces the citizens to participate in the political debate. Sorry for nitpicking but I think this is an important distinction.

&gt; Limiting the power of the government, especially the executive, to make important decisions is almost always positive.

You're absolutely right!

&gt; the current system promotes political parties to bring polarising and uncompromising initiatives

I think that any other (less direct) system can do that, too, and in that case political discussion become of a sharade.

null,false,hikari-boulders,null,null,null,"&gt; In fact, there have been many referendums which had a broad majority in the population, but were denied to them by Central Switzerland. 

You make it look like this is a bad thing, in the sense that the referendums and inititives which were denied were good and we would all benefit if they got accepted. How do you know that this ""quirk"" didn't save our asses? For this, you would need to look at those particular votes and see in which cases the quirk ""helped us"" and in which cases the quirk ""cost us good stuff"".

Also there is another issue: Even *if all of the quirked votes were actually bad* (i.e. it would be better if they have been voted the other way around), you have no basis to say that the quirk is negative. Because you would need 100+ years of experience *without the quirk* and thenn compare (A) experiences with the quirk with (B) experiences without the quirk. Or, to sum it up in one sentence: If you remove the quirk, how do you know that there won't be vote à la ""the biggest three cantons get all the money and the others are fucked""? What stops the big cantons from voting Yes?

The quirk comes directly from the constitution, I think even in one of the very first paragraphs (if not the first).
