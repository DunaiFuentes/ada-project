The conservative majority in the Swiss National Assembly has watered down a bill that would make freezing and returning of these assets clearer and easier on a legal basis. The watering down involved limiting the crimes and kind of people that would prompt the freezing of such assets as well as a statute of limitations.

TL;DR: In the end this means that dictators can still keep their money in Switzerland without much danger as long as they are relatively well behaved and their crimes weren't that recent. Returning the assets to the governments who it should belong to is still not very easy.
