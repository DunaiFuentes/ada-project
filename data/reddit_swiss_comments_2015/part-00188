You do not speak Swiss...

One reason for that is probably that there is no such language. We have four official languages: German, French, Italian and Romansh. The variations of German people tend to speak to others Swiss from the German speaking part are often called Swiss German but they are in fact a whole host of differing Alemannic dialects. People from the German part normally understand most of the dialects that are called Swiss German exept maybe Walliserd√ºtsch which can really be difficult.

Swiss people from the German part can all speak Standard German, though some might complain because they are less comfortable in Standard German compared with Swiss German.

Now if you want to edit again you can either write ""any Swiss language"" or maybe ""Swiss German"" or ""French"".

Those are the language barriers. La Chaux de Fonds is in the north of that green part (French speaking). Major cities for reference, Geneva (French speaking) is to the far West, Zurich (Swiss German speaking) is sort of North, Lugano (Italian speaking) is South, and Romansch is dispersed in the east.

Switzerland was at some point under the rule of Romans, French, Celtics, etc, but has also ruled areas of these countries/empires (Milan was under the Swiss for a bit) and has kept much of those cultures, kind of like the US but much older.

If you're wondering why you call it Swiss German, but not Swiss French or Swiss Italian, it's cause Swiss German varies much more from the original language than the others. For example a person from France could come to Geneva and understand basically everything, whereas a person from Germany could come to Zurich, Berne, or Basel and not understand much considering each of these cities speak a different kind of swiss german, and each of them are significantly different than German.

A typical Swiss person usually speaks one of the four languages perfectly, and another one decently, and most people speak English well too. For example I come from the french speaking part, so I speak French and English perfectly, decent German (not swiss german), and can probably get around in Italian just from knowing french
