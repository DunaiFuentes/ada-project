•	Would your wife be able to take care of the kids at home? If the answer is no, the age you listed means your kids would have to attend a crèche and that alone will cost you about 4000 CHF a month, assuming you can even find a spot for them. Considering your wife would be unemployed, you’d be given less priority by the crèche since they’d just expect her to stay at home. So some families with multiple kids actually have to run the numbers and decide whether it makes more sense for one of them to work and the other stay at home, or both work and pay for crèche.

•	I’ve been told by a few headhunters that unless you’re getting a huge raise (compared to current situation), one’s minimum to move to GVA from abroad should be 130K-140K pretax for a family of 3 (one child). So it seems you’re in that bracket. However, depending on your lifestyle I’d say that’s a bit low. And I’ll clarify that lifestyle hinges mostly on the type of apartment you rent and whether you own a car, not necessarily eating out/traveling. 

•	Insurance is the biggest ? for you and something you’d need to ask your employer about before you sign the contract. There’s no set amount, because it really depends on your employer. I know families of 3 that pay 1200 a month for insurance, and others that only pay 750.
