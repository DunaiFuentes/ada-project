null,false,Chocolate_fly,ju,Jura,null,"Well I haven't hiked the red trail, but I have been hiking in some of the areas it passes through. I think you would enjoy the hiking more in the green area, but that's just my opinion. 

The hiking is mostly in forests and alpine areas, where you will be hiking above the tree line and exposed to the sun (you will *need* sun screen and a good pair of polarized sun glasses). Most of the time you'll be above the tree line, but the views of the mountains are fantastic from that vantage point. Everyday you will pass by a few farms, each of which you can stop at to purchase fresh cheese or occasionally cured meats. There is not much asphalt hiking, except when you pass through a village, which will be once per day. (Most people sleep in the villages at night, and each day you hike up and over a mountain pass, and sleep in the next village. This is the common way to hike these trails). The villages are small so you won't see much asphalt even in these areas. (as a side note i do remember there being a lot of asphalt hiking from meiringen to grindelwald, but the trail went through the woods so it was a nice walk). 

Stealth camping is illegal, but many people do it. I did occasionally. However, the areas around grindelwald and lauterbrunnen will be too crowded to stealth camp and you should probably stay at a campground (i recommend the 'camping jungfrau' in lauterbrunnen). This would be a good opportunity to use the showers at the campgrounds too! Otherwise you can probably find a place in the forest outside of the villages to camp. I recommend setting up your tent just before sunset, and waking up just before sunrise. If you do this then you will have no problems (this is what I did often while hiking in the valais region). Be respectful of the forests and nearby farmland, obviously. Don't build a fire unless there is an obvious place to build one. 

For comparisons, I paid ~10-15CHF for a campsite, or ~25-40CHF to stay at a hostel/mountain hut. 

I hiked in August and the weather was nice. I didn't have any problems with insects. One other thing I will say is that the hiking is very strenuous. You'll be hiking up and over a steep mountain pass every single day. It's not dangerous, and the trails are well marked, but you will get tired. Wear good shoes, take care of your blisters, and most importantly keep your pack as light as possible! it makes a big difference.
