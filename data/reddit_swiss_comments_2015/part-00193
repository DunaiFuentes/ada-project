Just a fair warning, I did a hiking trip in high school years ago, and for some reason the school didn't know about this, but around parts of the Jura (not sure how much of it, I was around the St. Cergue-La Cure area) there are random large holes in the ground that are very deep and are often covered in bushes so it's hard to see. In pastures they are circled with barbed wire fencing to stop cows falling in I guess. We were hiking and had no idea, and then another local hiker told us to be careful lol.
