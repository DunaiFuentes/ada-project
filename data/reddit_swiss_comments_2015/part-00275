St-cergue in itself is a great place to to do outdoorsy mountain stuff - there are lots of great hikes, everything from 15 minutes to a whole day; there are numerous restaurants/chalets d'alpages that serve lots of awesome local things; and in the winter you have several different snow activities. If you're looking for a good hike, I'd recommend you go to the Fruitières de Nyon - it's a ~1h30 hike from St-cergue through authentic mountain roads, and at the end you're rewarded with an absolutely fabulous view and local cheese. If you're more adventurous the walk up to the Barilette could be cool too, however that's a bit more physical. For a short walk I could recommend the Ballade de Beatrix, which is a short walk away from St-cergue - maybe 15 minutes away, and you get a really nice view.
