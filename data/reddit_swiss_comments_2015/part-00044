So they said that i (as a russian) could apply for the year+ halbtax card with required photos, passport etc. No online application, i must order it at a counter.  
I would then receive a ""*transitory abonnement for two weeks*"" which ""*will subsitute the original card during two weeks and will offer you the same conditions*"".

I would then buy a 1-month travelpass using the said abonement and the pair (pass+abo or pass+card) would be equivalent of a 1-month GA (or SwissPass, i think their terms are equivalent).

The card would arrive later at the SBB station i specify.

Prices can be seen there: http://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/railpasses/half-fare-travelcard.html  
1-month travelpass price is in the Additional Offers tab.
