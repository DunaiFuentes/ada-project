null,false,Formagella,ti,Ticino,null,"Take a Trenord train to Milan, then take another regional train (TILO, these regional trains cross borders) from Milano Centrale (pay attention because some of these don't make all the stops in Switzerland) or take a 100% italian regional train from there to Chiasso and then from Chiasso jump on a regional train that makes all the stops. 

This is the cheapest and fastest way. 

Easiest way to do it: just use the sbb.ch website like the other guy said and it will have all the route and train changes planned out for you. 

Buy the 2 tickets you'll need either online if you have a printer to print the PDF (in Italy, never assume that it will be okay to just show it on the phone), or at the automatic machine in Bergamo (in this case: REMEMBER to stamp them at the yellow/orange machines or it's not valid!). 

If in Milan you have to go from one railway station to another with the underground, that's another ticket, you can find tobacconists that sell them in the metro stations or buy them from machines, but pay attention to gypsies acting as fake helpers, go with your money ready (2€ I think but you can check on ATM website) and buy it. 

If you take a TILO so that you don't have to change in Chiasso, that's going to be in Milan Central station, if you buy tickets there pay attention to the illegals. 

Now that I remember, there are trains that go to Milano Centrale from Bergamo and arrive before the TILOs leave, try taking one of them in combination with a TILO that stops in Riva if you want to have the easiest trip possible. 
The sbb.ch website will surely list these. 

Some time ago there was a problem that ticket machines in Italy didn't allow to buy a ticket for the regional train to a stop inside Switzerland (not just to Chiasso which is the border station), I don't know if they've solved that. If not, buy in advance on the internet or you'll have to jump down in chiasso, get another ticket to Riva San Vitale and wait half an hour for the next train. But maybe it's been fixed. 

Don't worry if you miss a regional train from Milan to Switzerland because your train from Bergamo is late, unless it's late in the evening, as there is one pretty often (one every 1-2 hours except on lunch), and the regional train ticket (the ones for the TILO) bought in Italy is valid 6 hours after being stamped, the ones bought online from trenord website and then printed 4 hours. 

Your stop is Capolago/Riva San Vitale, it's the stop right after you see the beginning of the lake. 


When in Italy, check for strikes here: http://scioperi.mit.gov.it/mit2/public/scioperi
