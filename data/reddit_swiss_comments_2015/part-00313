Easily the best site for games/films is www.wog.ch (seriously, they're great). I use www.buch.ch for books, but they tend to be a bit slow. Avoid physical shops, especially Media Markt, if you want to save money.  BTW, all the smaller online shops you'll find aren't bad either (check their ratings on toppreise, click on them to see the details), but they're usually either too expensive or too slow.

If you search for second-hand stuff, Switzerland is pretty big on www.ricardo.ch and www.anibis.ch next to ebay. Also, you'll usually get good daily offers on www.qoqa.ch (and qsport.ch, etc.), www.deindeal.ch or www.groupon.ch, but always check Toppreise before ordering anything.

The old town is very beautiful and you have plenty of restaurants and bars to go around. Most people gather near the river during the summer and just hang out there with their friends.

For a cheap gym try **Stämpfli-Gym** in Bellach which is just near Solothurn. It's actually quite good.

Shop at Aldi, Denner or Lidl if you want to save money. Shop at Migros, Coop or Solomarkt (now called Manor Solothurn Solo or something) if you want really good quality products but more expensive.

Every Saturday there's a small market in the old town, so you can get cheap stuff there as well.

Use the train and bus to get around the region, but I advise you get a cheap car or something in the long run.

Get M-Budget mobile since it's very cheap and good.

""Restoration of the polluted industrial harbour in Riga

Since 1872, the Sarkandaugava region has been used for the transport and storage
of petroleum products. The Swiss contribution is being used to fund a project
to decontaminate the soil and water, and to remove dangerous waste matter.
This should also put a halt to the pollution of the River Daugava which flows
into the Baltic Sea.""

This sub-project has a value of 13 Mio CHF it states. The total is 56.87 Mio CHF to Latvia. The overall contribution to some of the new EU countries in this ""project"" is 950 Mio CHF. 


Some more copy paste:

""A visit to the brownfield site in Riga's industrial port was on the programme in Latvia. The Soviet Army used the Sarkandaugava district in the 20th century to transport and store petroleum products, which continue to have a major impact on the environment and the health of local residents. Thanks to the Swiss contribution, Latvia can now remediate this brownfield site by pumping the layers of oil off the surface of the water and employing microbiological methods to clean up contaminated soil materials. Latvia's and Switzerland's objective in remediating the area is to improve its water and soil quality and to prevent petroleum products from entering the Daugava River and ultimately the Baltic Sea.""

and some more:

""Rehabilitation of contaminated sites: Following the successful completion of a pilot phase, the rehabilitation of two areas affected by oil pollution in the industrial port of Riga is currently under way. 315 tonnes of liquid oil layers have been pumped out. The goal of the project is to pump 900 tonnes. The remaining oil is being pumped out by a licensed waste disposal company in accordance with national and EU guidelines.

null,null,SwissBliss,vd,Vaud/Valais,null,"Ok so I come from Valais and Vaud (the neighbouring canton between Valais and Geneva).

Valais has two language, Swiss German and French. Sion and the Western part of the canton is almost 100% French speaking. The French in Switzerland is almost exactly the same as standard French, except for a small accent and maybe a couple of local words, but nothing like the difference between German and Swiss German.

Switzerland is very international, and only the real center of the country is more reserved. Sion is a fairly major city so it's totally normal to be a foreigner, and you're Swiss so it's even less of a problem. Also Canada has a great reputation here, we're similar in many ways, and I know lots of people here go to Canada on holiday.

Valais is the kind of the equivalent of the South in the US, sort of. It's dry with vineyards everywhere, the people are very warm and kind to each other, but if you go in a small village in the mountains you might get a look or two if you look foreign. I have Vaud car plates and when I go to my secondary house in Valais in a small village, everyone looks at me as a foreigner even though I come from the canton next door haha. It's not a mean thing, they're just curious.

Sion is in the valley, and you have the Alps around with famous destinations like Zermatt, Crans Montana, etc pretty close by. So it's the best canton for sports in general for sure. Mountains, forests, rivers, lakes, etc... Honestly there aren't many better places in the whole world for these types of things.

Sion isn't really great for nightlife (there is of course some, just not a ton), but the ski stations like Verbier, Zermatt, and Crans Montana are GREAT for nightlife, and you have some big cities nearby. Montreux has a very famous music festival with big artists, Lausanne is a university city with tons of parties, and Geneva is a major European city so obviously there's a lot to do there. All of these cities are reachable within 30min-1h30min by car or train, and it's a stunning route there along Lake Geneva.

Geneva and Lausanne are VERY international, to the extent that you here English and other foreign languages more than French in trains and public areas sometimes. I wouldn't worry about adapting to the mentality much, people are very average and welcoming.

Please ask me if you have any more questions. I'm pretty bored right now, so I can answer anything.

My entire education has been in an International School in Vaud near Geneva with 95% foreign students and staff, and I can't tell you how much they repeated that they were so fortunate to live here. It's so peaceful and tolerant, and at the same time beautiful and fun. The air is fresh and clean, the people are polite, the winters are perfect for sports, and the summers are full of festivals and fireworks. I think you'll love it here, really.

You don't really need a car, everything is easy accessible with public transportation or by foot. 

In your free time, you should go and drink a beer on the ""aaremüürli"" and get ice cream from the vitamin-station :)

SelfGym in Zuchwil would also be a cheap alternative for a gym.
