lol, who are you? George Bush? If you think democracy is about voting you clearly aren't very educated. E.g. what would be the point of democracy if there were no press freedom or political debate. This is exactly what you have in e.g. Russia. Do you really think in other countries the government can just do what they want just because the people don't vote on everything? But I think we both know that you don't understand any political systems outside Switzerland. You are the perfect example to proof my point. Pure ignorance and fundamentalism. You really think you are better than anyone else... how fucking arrogant...

&gt; Not letting foreigners vote is absolutely not undemocratic

Haha, you are fucking stupid. The whole point of democracy is that you are allowed to partake. You are even contradicting yourself. So if the Swiss can vote less than it's undemocratic but if the foreigners can't then it's okay? lol, go read some history and political science books. The whole point of democracy was that everyone had the right to vote and not just privileged people. There is no other reason than anti-democratic thinking and xenophobia to discriminate foreigners (and again, we are not talking about tourists, short term residence or criminals, but normal people that pay taxes). Why would you have to pay taxes and not be allowed to have a say?

&gt;  if they want to vote, they can become a citizen.

No, they can't. The Swiss are intentionally making it absurdly difficult to get a citizenship. You even have to wait more than a decade. And there is no reason to justify that a citizenship should be required for democratic rights. Obviously unless you are undemocratic, like Switzerland and people like you.

7 mandatory courses: Analyse 1 and 2 (Factor of 4), Géométrie analytique (factor 2), Algèbre linéaire (factor 2), Physique (factor 2), Biologie (factor 1), chimie (factor 1)

And a choice between 3 courses. You have to choose one of them: Application des maths (factor 2), informatique (factor 2), géométrie descriptive (factor 2).

&gt; 2) I took AP physics, AP chem and AP calc. How do these courses compare to what is taught in CMS?

You'll pretty much start from scratch. If you've got the will to study you shouldn't have any problems. I'm not familiar with the canadian school system though.

&gt; 3) I'm hoping on doing mechanical engineering after finishing CMS. What average do I need to get into mechanical engineering?

3.5 in the first semester and 4.0 in the second semester. Whether you have 4 in every course or a wide distribution doesn't matter as long as you get an average of 4.0 at the end of the second semester.

&gt; 4) I can understand French fairly well, but I don't speak too well. Will I be able to get by speaking English most of the time? Obviously, I'll get better over time, but I'm wondering about the first couple months.

Most people speak english (I would guess half of my class were foreigners). If you can understand french you'll be fine. I guess speaking french is an advantage though. Profit as much as you can, so start speaking early. No need to be ashamed, nobody gives a shit about your accent. 

The rest of the questions I can't answer. I went through the CMS year so feel free to ask any questions.

If your internship is fulltime, it might be very hard to earn that much on the side, you would have to work all weekend basically. But generally, with a bit of luck and basic german/french, it might be possible to get a job as a dishwasher which pays about 20 CHF/hr.

Here is a list of rooms in shared flats in and around bern (with prices):

I would recommend finding a shared flat, not only does it cost less, but you will meet a lot of cool people and have an easier time finding friends. 

Also it might be a good idea to apply for your  EU/Schengen citizenship, makes a lot of things easier. Even though if you have a job/internship beforehand, you should have no trouble getting into Switzerland (correct me if I'm wrong).

I hope my advice was helpful and not too discouraging. It sounds like an awesome opportunity. I wouldn't give up on it, Switzerland is a great place.

Yeah, it's a bit of a disadvantage if you can't speak German/French but if you are specialized enough, it should be too bad. Idk, this guy is giving you a very pessimistic picture.

Also with EU citizenship you can actually come here and search for a job. I think you can stay for three month or so but in reality it's much longer.

Not a lawyer though.



To OP:
If you're ok with the conditions of the internship and it's what you want to do don't let us get you down. laughinglynx pretty much said most of it. If you rely on funds from outside keep the exchange rates in mind, the Franc is stupidly overvalued (and will most likely stay this way) which makes it more expensive.
Also if the internship is full time, taking on another job will be hard work and personally i'd think twice on that but that's for you to decide.",null,0,null,1435274784,null,0,1435276256,0,csito41,null,t3_3b4685,null,t1_csito41,null,t1_csir421,null,null,null,1437353191,null,7,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,7,null
