Don't misunderstand me, but when something only gets 10% ""Yes"" votes as it happened a few weeks ago, people start to ask WHY to vote in the first place? The system is good, but the limit isn't up to date. 100'000 signatures were needed, and everyone of them was just able to convince someone else to vote for it to reach this embarrassing result. (The calculation is based on the assumption that we have close to 5 millions people who are allowed to vote). That would be something they should fix, but nobody wants to touch a unpopular topic like this, because he would be against the freedom to vote about everything! Obviously it is to easy to find 100k people to bother the whole nation with shit! The limit should be a certain percentage of people who are allowed to vote!
