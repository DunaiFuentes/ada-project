you seem to find apples and nuts boring... maybe if you find a new source (since you seem to give packaging and these things an especially high importance) and other varieties, you will find them less boring. we have plenty of other local fruits btw. go to the garden store and buy some berry plants, why not!

A quick search in a job-portal shows that there is work for translators but not an overwhelming amount of it. Also it seems that outside of these international organisations what is asked for is often a combination german (most prominent)/french/italian/english with the odd chinese or russian thrown in. Honestly, i have no idea what your chances for a good job might be. Embassies often have positions for translators as well, so maybe also look at that?


As for teachers, the pay is not bad. Depending on the level i'd say even quite good. In public schools that is. However they might not accept a foreign degree. Outside of public school it varies depending on what school you'd teach at. If you're interested in teaching in switzerland, it came up in this sub some days ago and you might find some answers there: https://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/38b5uq/what_would_it_take_to_teach_english_in_austria_or/
