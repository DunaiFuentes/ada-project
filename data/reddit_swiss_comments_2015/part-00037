The best tip I can give you, is prepare yourself way in advance. 

For instance it's really hard to find a flat in Lausanne, if you don't have the budget of a wealthy person. So start looking for one NOW.

Transport is really good here, the public transportation system is really advanced and reliable. The tickets are not cheap (as everything here) but you can buy them at pretty much every stop.

With food it depens. There are many good restaurants around and you will find food at all times of the day. In the normal supermarkets (Coop and Migros), you can buy from really cheap to super expensive food pretty much everything so it's up to you. Note that most of the shops are closed on sunday except near the trainstations.

It's very easy to open a bank account, just go to the bank of your choice. They will speak englisch there. Not that most of them close at 5 pm.

I hope I helped. Enjoy.",null,0,null,1422546024,null,0,1422547102,0,co4on19,null,t3_2u2z06,null,t1_co4on19,null,t3_2u2z06,null,null,null,1424324891,null,5,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,5,null

If you're low on money, ramen noodle, mbudget -migros- or denner food is great. Prix garantie beer-coop- is a good value (but many will disagree).

There is many bars in Lausanne or Geneva you will enjoy.

The bus/metro pass for Lausanne is 51 chf per month: [link to t-l.ch] (http://t-l.ch/se-deplacer/abonnements-et-billets/abonnements/abonnement-junior). It's worth it if you use it daily.

Yes. You can also take the boat over to Evian or to somewhere else on Lake Geneva, use all buses and trams in Zurich free of charge and take a free boat ride on Lake Zurich while you're at it. [Here's a table and map](http://www.sbb.ch/content/sbb/en/desktop/abos-billette/abonnemente/ga/_jcr_content/relatedPar/relateddownloadlist/downloadList/synoptic_map.spooler.download.pdf) showing where it's valid. TL;DR: Pretty much everywhere except funiculars, and it cuts prices in half for most of those. As you can see, it also covers some cross-border routes, which can be interesting if you want to do a shopping trip (from Lausanne, the boat service to Evian suggests itself, though I can also highly recommend a Saturday trip to the market in Domodossola).

(Edit: I can't justify paying for the thing considering what my current travel patterns look like, but man do I miss just being able to go to any train station and get on whatever train you want. It's magical and somewhat addictive.)
