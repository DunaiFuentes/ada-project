null,null,SwissBliss,vd,Vaud/Valais,null,"Ya each canton definitely has stereotypes, and the one of Valais seems to always be that they're the most rural and closed-off I guess, but that's quite exaggerated. It's not a racism or intolerance thing at all, it's just that people from Valais really like their canton haha. In the end we're all Swiss, whether we speak german, french, italian, or romansch. Every canton is beautiful and has unique things to explore, so don't be scared to visit the country.

You can definitely find many types of restaurants in Valais. In small mountain villages ya it'll probably be Fondue, pasta, some meat dish, fries, fairly common western foods. My secondary house is about 15 minutes up the mountain from Sion, and there's essentially just a little bistro (simple food and drinks, kinda bar-ish), and then if you want a nice and big restaurant I just follow the road further up the mountain and there's several ones close by.

However in Sion and even more in bigger cities you'll find Indian, Mexican, Argentinian, Turkish, Chinese, etc restaurants fairly easily. Fast food wise we have Mcdonalds, Subway, Burger King, etc as well (not KFC or Taco Bell). I don't think I've ever had Afro-Carribean dishes, so there might be but I'm not sure. The closest town to me is Nyon, Vaud, which has a population of about 18k, so half of Sion, and there's every kind of food (Thai, Indian, Ethiopian, Swiss, Italian), and that's in a fairly small town. In a city like Sion you'll get quite a bit of choice, and obviously in a super international city like Geneva you'll find basically any type of food you want. I went to Fribourg (close canton) a few months ago and I ate at a Canadian restaurant.

Honesty Swiss restaurants (they obviously aren't called that) are just variety restaurants. It's not like you go there and all there is cheese dishes. It's usually, like I said above, common dishes.

In conclusion, you can find basically anything you want in Sion and Valais, whether that be food or parties, but obviously going further towards Geneva will be even more international and vibrant.

Vaud is the canton I live in, and the best way I can describe it is that it's a nice mix of Geneva and Valais. It has big international cities, nice towns, good ski resorts, a lake, a riviera and vineyards. Definitely recommend that you visit it if you have time. Also if you have a car, Italy isn't that far from Sion. In an hour and half you can get from Sion to Aosta, 2 and a half to Turin, and less than 4 to the Mediterranean Sea.",null,0,null,1439573218,null,null,1439574110,0,cu2zeji,null,t3_3gxha6,null,null,null,t1_cu2ssv8,null,null,null,1441250113,null,1,null,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1,null
