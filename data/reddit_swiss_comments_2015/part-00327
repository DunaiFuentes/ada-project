[Useful acronyms](http://lhccwg.web.cern.ch/lhccwg/Bibliography/UsefulAcronyms.htm)

Just to address the specific ones you mention off the top of my head:

**fill**: a discrete period of time which might otherwise be called a ""run"" or ""cycle"" if these didn't mean something else. I think it covers the machine modes Setup to Ramp Down, or it might be Injection to Dump. I've marked some fills [in this image](http://i.imgur.com/UsoBNp6.png), although I'm not 100% certain when exactly the fill number changes.

**bunch**: a group of ~10^9 to ~10^11 protons all occupying the same bucket

**bucket**: a 2.5 ns interval of time that corresponds to one period of the RF cavity oscillation. A bunch sits in the middle of the bucket when it's properly in phase with the RF.

**run**: either the periods between long shutdowns (e.g. Run 1 being 2010 to 2012), or describing a period of days/weeks of one activity, like ""scrubbing run"", ""ion run"". 

**scrubbing**: circulating beams with high ""chromaticity"" in order to reduce electron-cloud effects from deposited gas. The name is quite literal. See http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/386682/ and http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.0345

**cosmics**: cosmic rays. Detectors sometimes sit there recording hits from cosmic ray muons when there's no beam.

It's so extreme that it doesn't even just apply to foreigners but also among Swiss (even so this it totally ridiculous considering how small the country is). Basically even someone from Basel that moved to Zurich will be a ""Basler"" even after ten years in Zurich. And there will be people making negative comments about your origin. And Zurich is actually one of the more open minded areas in Switzerland. If you are a foreigner that lives on the country side then your family will have to live here for two generations to be considered Swiss. E.g. even people that were born here but had foreign parents are still referred to as foreigners (or Secondos). Within a five years or so time frame there is no chance to integrate as a foreigner and most Swiss have no interest.

I think the main problem is Swiss culture that is simply hostile toward everything foreign but it's also institutional now. E.g. foreigner are refused democratic rights for over a decade, even if they behave well, pay taxes, create jobs. It couldn't be more undemocratic and it's intentional to claim that the share of foreigners are high and to create a segregation between Swiss and foreigners (e.g. even the police releases xenophobic statements specifically stating the nationality). 

Last but not least, the Swiss have become very complacent and arrogant, especially since Switzerland has been doing well during the crisis.

I really do feel like 'arrogance' is the wrong word and you're reading far too much into it. Are the Swiss 'chuffed' that their country isn't in the shit? Probably, and much more so when a common non-Swiss attitude is 'why have you guys gotta be different/hard and not join the international organisations and groups like everyone else'.

I mean, Switzerland wasn't even a member of the UN until 2002, let alone only being a partial member of the EU...

Switzerland is profiting from such organization while at the same time being very negative about them and claiming to be independent. It's very hypocritical. E.g. Switzerland isn't a NATO member but NATO is de facto protecting us as we are surrounded by them and they aren't hostile towards us. Image our neighbor would be Syria or so. They are helping us a lot, still we hate them and claim that our army protects us, which is borderline delusional. 

The same with the EU, Switzerland already got a special deal with the EU. Not that I am the biggest EU fan but the Swiss arrogance towards the EU is simply ridiculous. A lot of people are pissed that the Swiss can always get away with their inappropriate behavior. 

Same with the UNO, Switzerland always used to be very active in this organization, even the headquarter is here.

Basically my point is that it's Swiss culture to see our self as exceptional. However, exceptionalism is pretty much nothing but nationalism and xenophobia. Ironically, most nationalist in most countries think the are exceptional (e.g. American exceptionalism). However, it's very unlikely that the Swiss are actually exceptional, it's simply arrogance.

Historically I think were it went very wrong with Switzerland is WW2. Neutrality was all good and fine when we were surrounded by dictators but we didn't even help the democratic nations to free Europe from the Nazis. Not even towards the end of the war. That's basically like being neutral towards ISIS. Ever since people feel like they are confirmed in their view that Switzerland should stay away from everyone else and isolate itself. 

&gt;  I also believe the strong push for using Swiss products and plastering the flag all over local products plays very much into this.

Yeah, the most extreme example is food. Most Swiss, even left wingers, actually believe that Swiss food is exceptional and superior to every other food. I think Switzerland is the only country that has this almost fascist approach towards food. Which, honestly, is just fucking stupid. Nobody but the Swiss understands this. E.g. I used to live in the UK and if you buy high quality food here (e.g. M&amp;S) then it is at least as good as Migros or so and still much cheaper. It's almost like a religion or so in Switzerland.

&gt;Switzerland is one of the worst countries to integrate and notoriously xenophobic

That depends on *you* as a foreigner, how you act and what you do. And Integration is a very dangerous word, because everyone seems to have a different understanding of what it means and who is responsible for the outcome. I mean, I really doubt anyone would treat a foreigner in a xenophobic way if that foreigner joined a yodeling club and invited everyone for fondue. That is of course over the top, but you get the point. You actually have to pretend you give a shit about the place you live in! Wow! Language is also huge. Many expats don't even bother because it's not required for their jobs. But it's huge nonetheless, I'm going through the same thing right now in Finland, it's even easier to get around with English than in Switzerland, but if you don't know the local language, you'll always feel like a tourist.


&gt;Basically even someone from Basel that moved to Zurich will be a ""Basler"" even after ten years in Zurich. And there will be people making negative comments about your origin.

That is ingrained in our culture, yes. But most of this is a giant, albeit very boring joke and can be dimissed as such. Maybe somebody is gonna say ""Look at that arrogant Zürcher"", but in the end it's not an honest statement.

&gt;If you are a foreigner that lives on the country side then your family will have to live here for two generations to be considered Swiss. E.g. even people that were born here but had foreign parents are still referred to as foreigners (or Secondos). Within a five years or so time frame there is no chance to integrate as a foreigner and most Swiss have no interest.

That is such an overstatement. Like I said, it depends on *you*. Of course, some things can stick, for example, last names can be a burden. That being said, my dad changed his citizenship from Germany to Switzerland when he was 18, and I grew up as Swiss. Still, technically, I'm a secondo. But nobody would ever know because of the way I was brought up. Being integrated also means that you have to let your roots go to a certain extent. You can't have both. You have to make a decision at some point what you want to prioritise, at least that's what most Swiss people believe. It's a Swiss mindset that your roots are always there (in Switzerland or not), and you shouldn't forget about them, but at the same time, you have to devote yourself to your current place of residence. Also, five years is NOTHING. You cannot expect to be called Swiss and have a passport thrown at you after that time. Most countries don't do this, even in America it usually takes several years to become a citizen. And **it is possible** to integrate and learn the language within that period of time if one is devoted. I know this from several people very close to me, but I'm not comfortable with discussing their details here.

&gt;I think the main problem is Swiss culture that is simply hostile toward everything foreign but it's also institutional now. E.g. foreigner are refused democratic rights for over a decade, even if they behave well, pay taxes, create jobs. It couldn't be more undemocratic and it's intentional to claim that the share of foreigners are high and to create a segregation between Swiss and foreigners (e.g. even the police releases xenophobic statements specifically stating the nationality).

What have you been eating? It is by far not standard in any country for foreigners to have any democratic rights. I can't vote for shit where I live now, and this is the EU. I mean, I am a big supporter of municipal democratic rights for foreigners but you can't have everything. There needs to be a difference between citizens and non-citizens, otherwise the whole global system doesn't make any sense. I would be in favour of that, Earth citizenship and all that, but it with global politics, it's just not possible. It involves too much to lose for some people. So...you pay taxes, behave well, etc. Then what is the problem, why don't you just become Swiss? Shouldn't be a problem if you've lived here long enough and been an upstanding citizen. Then you can have everything. If not and you expect to get everything just after living in Switzerland for a short time, then you clearly don't value the words ""home"" and ""commitment"" as much as we do.

Swiss are not hostile to anything foreign by default, but it's true, we like our things to stay the same. What's wrong with that though? Why should we change our things so other people like it better? Nobody is trying to create a segregation, Jesus Christ! This isn't the apartheit. Yes, there are people rambling bullshit, namely SVP, but there are also people like you, doing the exact same thing, just from the other side. Do you think your rambling helps your cause? No, for fucks sake, it doesn't. It just makes the people who are already angry at you even more angry because it makes you seem like a needy little piece of shit. Which, truly, I'm sure you are not, but you have to understand how the Swiss mind works. *Change is slow.*

&gt;Last but not least, the Swiss have become very complacent and arrogant, especially since Switzerland has been doing well during the crisis. And any form of critic is usually countered very aggressively and there is a sense of entitlement. 

What /u/RadioaktivAargauer said.

&gt;Point in out xenophobia is a taboo, not even the left wing parties do it even though it couldn't be more obvious (e.g. it's totally sociably accepted to make xenophobic comments about Germans like ""they are all arrogant"").

I agree, people are scared. But the problem is that a small minority of foreigners continue to give them reason to be. And of course the media jumps on it like a bullet train. The media needs to be under stronger control because they make things seem worse than they are. And no, it's not acceptable to say that about Germans unless your friends are morons in which case you fucked up anyway.

At the same time, it still depends on *you*. How you act, etc. For most people, the xenophobia is just a first, small barrier that needs to be broken, after that, you're perfectly fine. This is because of all the stories they read and because they have never been abroad themselves other than for holidays. So you need to develop an icebreaker ability. There are wonderful stories of the most xenophobic farmers somewhere in the middle of nowhere becoming best friends with a black dude. It can and does happen. But say the black dude stays only with other black dudes. Say he doesn't speak the language. Say he doesn't put in an effort. Then there you have a stereotypical situation. Of course, it's not always this easy. *But damn is it easy to put the blame on us Swiss people.*",null,0,null,1440426492,null,null,1440431438,0,cudwj03,null,t3_3i6yhi,null,null,null,t1_cudtd8p,null,null,null,1441440320,null,19,null,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,19,null

I think you misunderstand. It's generally not the idea that Swiss food is better, but that it's better to support it. Many people also think (and in some cases, that's even true) that Swiss produce is also of better quality because it was ""made""/grown with a smaller use of pesticides and antibiotics. Many Swiss products are also ecological, so that's also something that's worth supporting. I dare say that Swiss people like international food, but are very keen to support the local ingredients/products.

Btw, plastering your flag on products is something that exists almost everywhere.

As a Swiss who has been living nearly half his life in countries abroad and works for one of the Big4 Audit firms, I can relate to your situation. But I also must tell you what you already know and try to encourage you to change the situation. Pardon me, but I included a short part about language, despite not knowing if you speak German :). If you do - even better!

The hard truth is that it only depends on YOU and no one else. No matter in which country you are there will always be people you don't like and do not get along with. Or most commonly you do not care about. So do not get scared by that. The most difficult part is usually meeting new people and than the things move slowly progress to more. So for a start you already know that speaking the local language or at least understanding it is fundamental to any social integration (Expat communities not considered of course). Next thing is to try and improve your language skills. I and all my friends have and will not judge a person for learning the language, let alone make fun of them. So soldier on - mistakes are common and necessary. After all, any language you speak will broaden your mind and teaches you also how people think. By speaking French (assuming so as you are from Luxembourg) you already have it much easier in Basel. Although German will be easier overall :).

Next is the most intimidating part. It forces you to actively go outside and participate in social activities. No clubbing or something like that. Join a club for an activity you like, ask some colleagues with similar interests if they belong to such a club and could recommend you one. Or if you like do something you never did before and always wanted to try it - now is the time to do so. This can really be anything: a tennis club, a running group or an introduction session into freediving. It is absolutely up to you. Granted some activities are more difficult to find friends such as Yoga etc., but it doesn't matter in the end. Once you know into which direction you want to go, proceed with finding a place nearby and call them. Be open and tell them that you currently only speak little German, but are fluent in French and English. Also tell people that is ok to speak German with you as you want to learn. If you liked it than go again. If not - no problem, worst is you found out that this club isn't what you liked and you met some new people. Go somewhere else and try again. This will slowly progress into more. Under no circumstances should you let that influence you and your set objective to meet nice people. 

Also you can ask colleagues if they would like to join you to the cinema or invite them for dinner at your place. Make it a cooking event with partners for example. I've introduced many colleagues to friends outside of work and also invite them to join us on a weekend out.
