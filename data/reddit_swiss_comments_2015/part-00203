Tagging is a ""SachbeschÃ¤digung"" (Art. 144 StGB). According to that article, the penalty is jail up to 3 years or monetary penalty. But don't worry - you will not go to jail for spraying. 

The fine will depend on what exactly you did (how many tags, how big they were, what they said, where they were located etc) and you (how did you cooperate with law enforcement and judges, if you had conflicts with the law in the past). It will also depend on your financial situation, so there is really no way of even remotely guessing the potential range without any further information. Also you have to account for the ""SpruchgebÃ¼hren"" which will be a couple hundred francs if you get a ""Strafbefehl"", and reach 4 digits if this goes to a judge. 

The tricky part, though, will be the civil lawsuits that will follow. More precisely, you will have to cover 100% of the costs it took to remove your graffiti. I don't know how expensive that is, but even if you calculate conservativley and estimate 250.- per tag we're already talking about ~5k CHF, and that's without administrative cost.
