You must register with the canton within 14 days of moving into the country.  The residence permit is separate which you don't need to get until towards the end of the first 3 months (although you will be constantly asked for it by canton and health insurance company, so you might want to get it started sooner if you don't immediately find a job).

You won't need to do this until applying for the permit - and they won't unrealistically expect that you provide documentation if you just arrived.  Depending on the canton they probably won't even care that much - or won't care that much until you're on further renewals if you still aren't employed.  Just keep good documentation of the jobs you're applying for to so that you can provide it if necessary.
