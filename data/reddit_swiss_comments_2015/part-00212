Wilders started complaining about Islam, praising our Christian roots, where almost the whole country spent the last 40 years ignoring and untieing those roots.

That's one thing I wish Switzerland would be somewhat less culturally entrenched in its past: Just buy a watch with an alarm-clock for the few people who don't have one yet, and turn those damned church bells off. Yes, you had them for centuries, we invented something better, start using it.

Well obviously my opinion is just my opinion. Many people in Switzerland, especially in the cities, are like folks in the NL and in most cities of the world: They don't like being waken up by church bells early in the morning on a day off.  

It's an interesting case, this Wilders. Not that I'm particularly following him on this anti-islam thing, but in a sense we have to admit that since there's a heavy presence of Islam in Europe, things have changed. I don't buy this shock of civilizations scenario, but we must admit that we were ""more free"" when all the multicultural propaganda wasn't needed. 

You know, being in connection with our past is a positive thing. It can become a negative dynamics when it becomes obsessional (like with Wilders I guess), but something becomes obsessional when it's forbidden. 

That's why people like me don't like this so-called ""progressive"" stance that love for ""diversity"" and other cultures is mandatory, while everything done by Whites throughout history is bad. Because that's not true. Arguably, we're the greatest civilization that's ever existed, and some people want us to deny this and bash ourselves into this foul-smelling cultural relativism. 

Switzerland is probably what's left of the European soul, being at its center, and where mentalities haven't changed much (at least in the more rural areas) despite two (luckily avoided) world wars. Church bells, my friend, are here to remind us that indeed our past is alive, and this we can't deny; if we do deny it, we'll be without roots; and without roots, nothing grows. Roots, I think, are sacred. 

Hence, progressism is all fun and games, but push it over the top and it becomes an agent of death and sterility. Here goes my rant. ",null,0,null,1433450611,null,0,false,0,crvpxoh,null,t3_382q86,null,t1_crvpxoh,null,t1_crvos4e,null,null,null,1436733118,null,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1,null
