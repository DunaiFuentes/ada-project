Thoughts on your link: From Dietschiberg you have a great view over Lucerne. From Sonneberg your view is mostly limited to Kriens and Horw (IMO less spectacular than Dietschiberg). But the trails are kinda cool there. Don't forget to pass by Chateau Gütsch if you go for Sonneberg. It's scenic there. 

If you stay close to Lucerne (Pilatus, Sonneberg, Dietschiberg) I recommend to buy a Day Pass for Public Transport (Zone 10). That's 6 bucks and you can ride Buses and Trains to and from all this destinations.

null,false,StuffedWithNails,ge,Genève,null,"Bonjour,

J'ai lu vos deux revues publiées à ce jour (*Human Universe* et *Empty Hands, Open Arms*). Ce sont les fautes d'orthographe qui m'ont le plus dérangé, je suis très pointilleux à ce sujet et ai depuis longtemps l'oeil pour les repérer. Je vous suggère donc d'y prêter une attention particulière lorsque vous écrivez, et peut-être de faire relire vos textes par une tierce personne avant leur publication, si vous en avez la possibilité. Je sais par expérience qu'on est malheureusement plus susceptible de manquer lors de la relecture ses propres fautes de style ou d'orthographe, tandis que l'avis de quelqu'un d'autre permet souvent d'identifier ces erreurs.

Je n'en suis bien sûr pas moi-même à l'abri, a fortiori car expatrié et vivant dans un pays non francophone, j'ai perdu de la pratique du français oral comme écrit et n'ai plus toute l'aisance verbale de l'époque de mes études, qui remontent à dix ans environ. Autrement dit, je ne suis ni critique littéraire, ni prof de français, je ne prétends pas être parfait, mais vous vouliez du feedback, alors voilà... :)

Conscient que vous êtes québécois -- je m'en doutais à la lecture de votre blog et l'ai confirmé via Whois de votre nom de domaine -- je ne dirai rien quant à votre style ou quant à certains choix de mots ou de tournures, car je sais bien que le français québécois, bien que français, est différent à certains égards du français de l'Ancien monde que je parle, et je l'accepte sans arrière-pensée. L'orthographe française, en revanche, ne varie pas, je vous réitère donc ma suggestion d'y prêter une attention particulière!

Pour en venir au fond et non à la forme de vos revues, je dirais qu'elles constituent de bons résumés de ces livres. Je ne les ai pas lus, je ne peux donc pas en dire davantage, mais puisque votre audience sera présumément composée de gens comme moi qui n'ont pas lu ces livres, il me semble que leur résumé est adéquat. 

Je dois dire, par contre, que la critique des livres me laisse un peu sur ma faim, mais je ne sais pas trop comment vous expliquer pourquoi sans paraître hautain, c'est un de mes défauts, j'espère donc que vous ne m'en tiendrez pas rigueur car je suis plein de bonnes intentions.

Peut-être trouvé-je vos critiques trop simplistes; j'aimerais que la critique aille plus en profondeur, mais ne puis vous dire avec précision dans quelle direction. Peut-être avez-vous vous-même une certaine connaissance des sujets abordés, et peut-être en avez-vous élaboré une opinion personnelle que vous puissiez opposer à celles mises en avant dans les livres.

Ou encore, peut-être avez-vous lu d'autres livres ou vu d'autres films dont les sujets se rapprochent du sujet de votre article, de sorte que vous pourriez les comparer de diverses manières (qualité de la présentation, don de persuasion/charisme de l'auteur, méthode scientifique s'il en est, etc.).

Par comparaison, quand je lis la critique d'un film (j'avoue ne pas lire de critiques littéraires, d'où mon choix d'exemple), j'attends de l'auteur qu'il ou elle soit bien au fait du cinéma en tant qu'art, et s'il s'agit d'un documentaire, a fortiori scientifique, que l'auteur possède des connaissances en lien avec le sujet dudit documentaire.

De façon globale, je trouve souvent que les critiques professionnels sont prétentieux et pénibles, mais ça n'engage que moi. Ceci pour dire qu'il existe un équilibre entre une critique simpliste et une critique prétentieuse, et c'est là que je voulais en venir: peut-être pourriez-vous chercher à approfondir un peu votre critique en puisant dans vos connaissances préalables d'un sujet X abordé par tel ou tel livre.

En bref, puisque vous êtes géographe de formation, sans doute les sujets des deux articles publiés à ce jour vous tiennent-ils à coeur, je vous suggère donc de vous servir de votre formation et de vos expériences pour aiguiser et approfondir votre critique lorsque vous en avez les moyens. Vous l'avez déjà fait dans une modeste mesure, mais je pense qu'il serait judicieux d'analyser un peu plus en profondeur. 

Par exemple, vous pourriez vous étendre sur le contexte que vous connaissez des sujets abordés par les livres afin de sensibiliser le lecteur sur ledit contexte. Votre critique du livre sur le Congo et les chimpanzés bonobos est lacunaire: il n'y est fait qu'une allusion indirecte à ce qui menace le chimpanzé bonobo dans son habitat naturel. Je connais personnellement le problème, mais il est fort probable que votre lecteur moyen n'en connaîtra pas grand chose. Il n'est même pas garanti que le lecteur moyen sache qu'il existe une différence entre le chimpanzé commun et le chimpanzé bonobo, ou même qu'il sache concrètement ce qu'est un chimpanzé, et non un orang-outang ou un gorille, pour citer les autres grands singes. Ils sont certes très différents les uns des autres mais tout le monde ne le sait pas. 

Bien sûr je ne vous dis pas d'expliquer au lecteur ce qu'est un chimpanzé ou un bonobo, mais une fois encore, il serait judicieux d'évoquer dans les grandes lignes ce qui fait que les bonobos sont menacés ainsi que les enjeux des programmes de conservation et les problèmes qu'ils rencontrent, plutôt que d'y faire indirectement allusion sans s'inquiéter de la connaissance du sujet par le lecteur. Cela servirait à mieux mettre l'objet du livre en perspective.

Bon, je m'en tiens là, je vois sans me relire dans le détail que j'ai pondu une tartine de texte bien au-delà de ce que je m'imaginais au départ; la verbosité est aussi un de mes défauts...

And that makes absolutely no difference. Natural things aren't safer, better, or healthier. The difference between natural ""cures"" and medicine is that medicine is tested for safety and efficacy.  
If something natural seems to work at curing some disease, it gets tested, the active ingredient(s) are extracted, and then labs synthesize them. The result is the exact same thing at the molecular level.

&gt; People are way too quick to take a pill at every slight pain, and doctors get a ton of cash from basically prescribing it for everything.

Producers of natural ""remedies"" like herbal teas, as well as alternative medicine, also make a ton of cash from it.

Natural? You can't seriously be saying that the dose in a tea bag is natural... it's just whatever dose tastes good given the average tea cup size.

By the way, do you know what comes in ""natural doses"", too?  
Bitter almonds. [Eight of them is enough cyanide to kill you](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1273391/?page=3).  
Hemlock. [Just a small dose and you're dead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conium_maculatum#Poison).  
Belladonna. [Pretty berries... eat two and die](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropa_belladonna#Toxicity).  
Amanita phalloides. [Half of one is lethal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_phalloides#Toxicity).  
Box jellyfishes. [Touching one means death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_jellyfish).  
Nature is filled with stuff that kills you.

&gt; and the other is a heavy unnatural dose

It's a dose tailored to cure whatever the medicine cures. If that happens to be more than nature, so what?  
Whenever you eat food like saffron or pine nuts, you're also eating ""heavy unnatural doses"".

&gt; We shouldn't act like pills and medication are 100% natural at base and super safe.

We don't. They are tested for both safety and efficiency before they're allowed to be sold.

&gt; They have tons of secondary effects and even sometimes makes a person more sick.

Everything has secondary effects. A friend of mine risks death if he merely touches a carrot, a stalk of celery, and a bunch of other things; make him a soup with vegetable broth and he'll die before finishing the plate if he doesn't have his (unnatural!) medicine with him.

&gt; I won't take hard medication for a small problem when there's lots of stuff I can do at home to help.

Aspirin isn't hard medication. And unlike your home remedies, it's been shown to work and to be safe.
