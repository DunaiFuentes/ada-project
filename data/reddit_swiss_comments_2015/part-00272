A hike to the glacier of mount titlis would be possible.

Regarding camping, there is no general camping ban except in National Parks. You can camp anywhere because of the ""Jedermannsrecht"". If there is no "" Camping prohibited""sign. Be sure to ask before camping on private property.

The Tour du Dents du Midi would also be a beautiful hike. You couldnt do it with camping gear but you can stay in mountain huts quite cheaply (much less than Airbnb). End of October is the absolute latest as its high (above 2,000 metres).

For camping I would recommend Lac De Taney and some hiking from there up to Le Grammont or Cornettes de Bise for stunning views over Lake Geneva. Lac de Taney is a lord of the rings type place, absolutely stunning and surrounded by mountains on all sides - but it starts to get cool in fall when the sun is lower in the sky, I wouldn't recommend it after September.

Lauterbrunnen as mentioned is nice, you might want to consider Thun or similar für airbnb and or cheaper places to stay. You can start a whole lot of trips from Thun, it's the gate to the oberland with fantastic view of the bernese alps. 

About camping, the also mentioned ""Jedermannsrecht"" does not apply in switzerland (sadly) as it does in sweden for example. So in general you are not allowed to camp anywhere you like. If you ask the owner of privat ground they most likely will let you camp though. If you are high up in the mountains a bivouak would be legal, although I guess you plan to take more than just a bivi sack. Lot of SAC (swiss alpine club) huts will let you camp outside for a little fee to use their toilet so you might consider this as well. 

Concerning gluten-free: Most supermarkets have gluten-free products. It'll be marked as something like ""gluten-frei"". Restaurants often do not specifically have something mentioned on the menu but if you ask the personell they will most likely say it's no problem. Just let them know!

Hope you will have a great trip in this beautiful area. If you're interested for a nice hike or so, let me know. I'm around ;)

I would definitaley suggest to pick up some maps/infos/emergency numbers etc. on local tourist info centers. If you go to Lauterbrunnen you will find enough lol. 

Alpine camping above forest line will never be a problem, I would still recommend a spot near one of the SAC huts. Talk to the caretaker before and they will let you camp near the hut.

Lastly for the region
