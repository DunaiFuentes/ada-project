&gt;Is there a stigma associated with the gluten free lifestyle?

Nothing like I've seen and read from US media.  There *is* an awareness that not everyone who is on a gf diet actually needs to be on it, but I haven't really heard anything extremely negative or misleading about the disease.

&gt;Is there much of a gluten free fad of people who, as you said, are on a gf diet for some inexplicable reason?

I know a lot of people who are on a gluten free diet who put themselves on said diet and are not diagnosed celiacs.  As you might have guessed, these are primarily the people who follow every health food diet fad that comes along.  Since the actual rate of celiac disease is so low, it's these people who keep the shelves stocked with food I can eat, so I'm not mad at them.  Besides, some of them say that avoiding gluten helps them avoid bloating, as well.
