If you want to see how switzerland looks, that's one of the more authentic(and pretty) places.

But i don't even think you have to decide. The public transportation in switzerland is excellent.Even the really small towns have a bus or train arriving at least every hour and on time. Punctuality is a stereotype we're proud of ;-) . So my suggestion is: go to a central place, bern for example, and then you can visit solothurn( about 40 minutes by train) on one day, go skiing in gstaad (about 90 minutes) on another.

If you want to explore Graubünden (the canton St. Moritz is situated in, and also the one I'm from), I'd set up base in Chur and go from there with trains and busses. There is no nice and central place in GR to be close to everything, but Chur is the biggest town and is connected both to the RhB (local railway), the SBB (Swiss railway) and also to the post car network (long distance busses). 

There is quite a lot to do around Chur already, and the further you're willing to go away, the more possibilities open up (duh). 

For camping, best go up some mountain that isn't overrun by tourists. There are some where you can get pretty far up with rope lifts so you don't have to carry a tent around all the time. I'd say even if you went up the Dreibündenstein (mountain right next to Chur) and walked up to the summit (quite easy hike, shouldn't be a problem with a tent) then you should have good sky, even though you're relatively close to the city (it's only 30k people though).
