## Cafeterias

* **Esplanade**  
The one everybody will see as soon as they come to EPFL, in the center building (CO).  
Unfortunately, it's a trap for new students who have classes at CO and don't want to go elsewhere. The food ranges from mediocre to bad and there's only one choice of meal (plus ""lasagnas"" and other oven-baked things that float in oil).

* **Cafétéria BC**  
At the very top floor of the BC building, you can't miss it. Has a terrace with a nice view, but not many chairs.  
The food is mostly good, with a choice of one student-priced meal, one student-priced vegetarian meal, and one ""special"" meal.  
Can get very crowded, especially when some of the tables are reserved for colloquiums.

* **Cafétéria MX**  
In the MX building.  
Requires a reservation. Serves the two student meals from Cafétéria BC.

* **Ornithorynque**  
In the life sciences (SV) building's ground floor.  
Large choice of meals, usually with one or two vegetarian options, one or two pasta options, and a few more expensive and fancy dishes.  
Gets crowded pretty fast, and has a less-than-optimal queuing system.

* **Corbusier**  
In the architecture (SG) building's ground floor (below the one you normally enter in).  
Currently trying to reinvent itself, there's pasta, pizza, and a vegetarian buffet.  
A bit more expensive than others.

* **Parmentier/Vinci**  
Two cafeterias located next to each other in the CM building's first floor, serving the same food.  
Three choices of meals, plus cold platters, and grilled specialties (which are more expensive).  
Gets crowded very quickly.

* **Puur Innovation**  
In the ""Quartier de l'Innovation"" (QI), to the south of the BC building.  
Clearly more expensive than others (1.5-2x), but has a larger, fancier and often better choice of meals.  
I've heard their vegetarian meals sometimes contain fish/seafood.

## Food trucks

* **Roulotte pizza**  
In the ""Diagonale"", between CO and IN.  
As its name implies, serves pizzas. Pick a base (normal, with tuna, with meat, ...) and fill a container with toppings, and they'll make you a pizza.  
Unfortunately, this stretches the definition of ""pizza"", the crust is nothing like a real pizza, and generally they're not particularly good.

* **Roulotte kebab**  
In the ""Diagonale"", closer to IN than the Roulotte Pizza.  
Serves kebabs, hamburgers, and other street foods.  
Owned by the guy who owns the Roulotte Pizza, and also not particularly good.

The next three trucks give you 0.50 CHF off if you bring your own lunch box / plate / ...

* **Maharaja**  
Indian food truck down the stairs from the INJ building.  
More expensive than cafeterias (11.50 CHF), but has a ""1 free meal for 10 paid meals"" card.  
Three choices of meat dishes (usually chicken/pork/beef), three choices of vegetarian dishes (you can pick two), and sometimes one fish/seafood dish.  
One of the best choices for vegetarians.

* **Hong Thai Rung**  
Thai food truck next to the Maharaja.  
All meals are 10.00 CHF; I think they also have a card for free meals.  
Some people love it, others think it's too bland.  
Has a very large choice of spicy peppers to add to your meal (for free).

* **Obeirut Lebanese Cuisine**  
Lebanese food truck next to the BC building.  
Relatively cheap sandwiches (8 CHF), that can be served as part of a platter with hummus, tabouleh and mutabbal.   Also serves ""mezze"" platters for 15 CHF.

## Sandwich shops

* **Cafétéria INM**  
In the INM building, next to the door towards INF.  
Serves a variety of sandwiches for 7 CHF.

* **Klee**  
In the Rolex Learning Center, before the Hodler.  
Sells many kind of sandwiches, salads, small pizzas, ...

* **CUT**  
In the ""Quartier Nord"", at the metro station to Renens.  
Pseudo-chic but very reasonably priced (except drinks!), mostly cold food such as sandwiches, bagels and salads. Also sells a variety of interesting desserts.

## Other

* **Migros**  
Migros is one of the two main supermarket chains in Switzerland (the other being Coop).  
Sells everything you'll need: food (both raw ingredients and prepared meals/sandwiches), office supplies, personal care, ... no alcohol though (see Denner).

* **Denner**  
The founder of Migros didn't want to ever sell alcohol.  
So Migros bought off Denner, a budget supermarket chain, to sell alcohol under their name.

* **Le Négoce**  
Tiny supermarket in the CM building's ground floor, next to the exit towards CE.  
They mostly have food, a small assortment of personal care products, and some office supplies.  
More expensive than Migros.",null,0,null,1433279318,null,0,1433315921,0,crtfmyl,null,t3_389qcd,null,t1_crtfmyl,null,t1_crte1zk,null,null,null,1436676043,null,3,false,EPFL,t5_2svyx,3,null

null,false,Aethec,ba-in,null,null,"## Study plans

Don't trust the online study plans, or the ones on IS-Academia, only [the student services](http://sac.epfl.ch/registrar-office/study-plans-regulations).

Read both the study plan and the rulebooks carefully, as they contain very important and often non-obvious information related to criteria you must fulfill to get a degree.

Do not assume that because a class this year, it will necessarily be taught the next year. This is mostly the case, but there are many exceptions for various reasons (usually related to professors leaving, taking sabbaticals, etc), and not teaching the course at all is often the result (instead of replacing the professor).

## Class hours

Unless explicitly stated by a professor, attendance is not mandatory.

Lecture hours are usually ex cathedra lectures.

Exercise and project hours may be interchangeable depending on the course, and mostly involve solving exercises or doing projects with TAs in the room to help you if you're stuck.

Office hours are not mandatory, some courses have them and some don't, and their schedule is often irregular.

## Credits

The number of credits a course has may or may not be related to its difficulty. 4 credits could mean you'll be working 0, 6 or 15 hours per week. This varies even more with classes that have optional prerequisites: if you take a computer graphics class in C++ and you don't know C++... expect to work a lot.

## Exams

There are two kinds of exams: during the semester, i.e. during the last week, or during the exam session, which starts a few weeks after the semester ends.

Independently of when the exam is, courses may also have midterms, quizzes, labs, graded homework, or other forms of examination during the semester.

## Famous professors

It is tempting to assume that because a professor is (very) famous in their field, they must be a great teacher. This is sometimes true, and sometimes not.  
One common point, though, is that famous people are usually very nice - they wouldn't have made it that far if they weren't.",null,0,null,1433280773,null,0,false,0,crtgklj,null,t3_389qcd,null,t1_crtgklj,null,t1_crtg4pg,null,null,null,1436676583,null,1,false,EPFL,t5_2svyx,1,null

There are many rooms in the campus that are free most of the time, so you can study there. You will of course be asked to leave when there is a class.

One exception to that last rule is the computer rooms, such as INF 1/2/3 and CO 020-023; if you stay quiet, most professors won't mind if you stay while they teach as long as there's enough chairs for their own students.

Some buildings have dedicated studying spaces that are always available, such as the former library in INM.

## During weekends/nights

You can open some buildings (usually CE, CM, CO + the ones from your faculty) with your CAMIPRO card during weekends and nights, i.e. outside of normal hours.

Security guards may come and ask for your student ID. Some of them are very polite and just want to help, some of them are more annoying; as a general rule, be nice to them, even if they don't return the favor.

If you are studying in a room you cannot open yourself, don't get trapped outside with your belongings still inside!  
If you do get trapped, you can always call security, but it's annoying for everyone.

*Do not* drink alcohol inside rooms during these periods. You will probably be kicked out.

## Sleeping on the campus

Officially, you cannot sleep on the campus; security guards *will* wake you up, and may ask you to leave. You probably can get away if you're two people: one of you sleeps, the other stays awake and wakes the other up when a guard is nearby.

## The ""Rolex Learning Center""

It's that wavey building with holes in it.

It contains a library, which has two kinds of studying zones: quiet and silent. The former means you can whisper a bit, the latter means you must be completely silent, period.

Unless you're willing to get up early, you most likely won't find many free spots, especially if you're a group. This is doubly true during exam periods.

There are ""bubbles"", spaces you can book to study or have meetings in.

It may have changed since my time but I'm not sure we would have been ready for an English only class.

Another option besides the international school would be aiming for adult education often provided by independend institutes (like the Migros Klubschule) or as a side offer at high schools. Requirements there vary but generally tend towards language teaching certificates only. But I'd also expect more competition there and as such good German/French skills are probably expected regardless of whether or not the students could follow a lession held in English.

How hard it is to get a job will depend on where you got your degree (and if Switzerland accepts that degree for teaching in public schools) as well as your german skills. Also competition will be stiff since we have a lot of English graduates and a lot of them get their teaching degree (hell the university even recommends you do) to have a ""save"" job lined up.
