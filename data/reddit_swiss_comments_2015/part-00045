Your biggest problem is, that you are here during the official winter school holidays (9. Feb. - 20. Feb.). Which means, everything is even more expensive and there are a lot, a lot of people on the slopes. So you might want to plan one day trips only and get there first thing in the morning. Meaning you catch the very first gondola going up to the mountain.
