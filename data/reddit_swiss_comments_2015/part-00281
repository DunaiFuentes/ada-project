The most remote points are three hours away by public transit. So anything is doable if you want it bad enough. However, Switzerland is jam-packed with beautiful places and you definitely can't see it all. The good news is that you can pretty much pick whatever and be very happy you went - no need to think ""oh Lucerne is overrated I should have gone to the Matterhorn."" It's all good.

* Check out the weather in Ticiono (Lugano or Locarno). The probability that it's sunny there is much higher. You can travel to Lugano by train in three hours. It's also a very beautiful part of Switzerland plus it has some Italian vibe (people there speak Italian)

* Take a boat tour on Lake Lucerne. IMO it is even more beautiful and romantic on a cloudy day.

* Do the Glacier Express. You will basically stay in the train all day long, so there's no need for an umbrella.

My recommendation is to spend Saturday in the Bernese alps, except if the weather is really bad and spend the evening and Sunday morning in a town somewhere. IMO pick one of Berne, Gruyere, Lucerne. Gruyere is really small, so you could even drive there in the evening, stay the night and then early in the morning head off to Berne and see the old town for a bit (don't miss Rosengarten, best view).

If you flatten out Switzerland, it's about the size of Texas (read that somewhere). On a map Switzerland looks pretty small, but don't forget that a map only shows horizontal distances and not vertical distances. That makes a big difference here. A small distance on a map could actually be a very long one in reality. 

For example: Near Geneva we have Lake Geneva on one side and the Jura Mountains on the other. The map distance from the lake to a town in the mountains is only 8km/5miles. In reality following roads that's 22km/14miles and takes about 40 minutes.
