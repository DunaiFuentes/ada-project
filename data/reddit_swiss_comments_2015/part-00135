Honestly, it's hard to imagine you're going to meet other people or tourists just out and about while in Zurich for a holiday. 

That said, I would see the city, suck it up and stay in a hostel for a night or two, that way you'll have more chance of meeting people... with the people you meet go and party on Langstrasse or Hardbrücke on Saturday.

Recover the next day, see the city and go to Uetliberg. If you're staying much longer, get a train to Interlaken, check into the backpacker hostel. While you're there, see Grindelwald and go for a hike there. May is also the best time for paragliding, so sort that out!
