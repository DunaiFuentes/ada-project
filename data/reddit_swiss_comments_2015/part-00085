but you know what would have been polite? to communicate on the topic instead pointing at anyone else. 

if you were interested in the topic of corporal punishment in switzerland..that would have been cool. if you were interested in talking about that in regards of other countries you could have submitted links to the subs or simply asked people what they think about corporal punishment in general.

But nooooooes...you chose to start by naming some other countries without ANY special relation to the topic. France is an EU member and surely face consequences from eu courts. Switzerland isn't. The only thing switzerland after 45 ever agreed to is Schengen ...well, and taking bloodmoney.

How polite was it to just say ""ha, other countries bad tooooo""?

The job situation in Switzerland is pretty good and I would consider that you would get a job in Switzerland. Always depend on what you like to do and in which area you would like to work. 

I am from Berne myself and I can really recommend you this city for living. People here are very relaxed and easygoing, there are a lot of students as well and on top of that there are so many lovely spots everywhere close. 
Honestly I think people are probably not as open-minded as you might be used to it in Sweden. So it might take some time until you get to know people, but there are always people who are very open-minded and would like to meet new people. 
And there is so many things to do here, great summers and great winters. 
Specially the summer in Berne is priceless, you can stay on the Aare have barbecue with friends, go swimming in the river or just sitting around the fire.
