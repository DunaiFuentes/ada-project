Maybe I'm just more polite than the typical zebra-crossing person in Zürich. Who knows? Also, personally, I have never seen a driver ignore my little hand-wave gesture (they usually nod or give a little hand-wave back).

I'm not thankful for people not killing me when I cross a pedestrian crossing. The same way I don't wave to cars for not veering onto the footpath and murdering me there, even though they could, or not running traffic lights, even if it's well within their power. As for cars travelling too fast or weather conditions being too bad to break properly... maybe you're just a bad driver? I've never had an issue with it. Pedestrian crossings are sign posted where I am, and I always slow down a bit approaching them, and check the footpaths, to make sure if I need to stop I can safely do so.

Can you imagine being the guy in front and seeing another group of pikemen marching towards you and you know that you won't survive? It's crazy to think how they wouldn't just run away...

Here's a description of a battle like this:

&gt;The push of pike would continue until one of the opposing formations collapsed, which would generally lead to massive casualties. During push of pike, opposing blocks of pikemen would advance with their pikes ""charged"" horizontally at shoulder level to jab at one another until bodily contact was made. The two sides would then push physically until one or other of them gave way. This habit had on many occasions disastrous consequences as the side with the longest pikes had the advantage during push of pike.

Also very interesting is that the word Nostalgia used to be called *mal du suisse* because it was first described by the anxiety of Swiss mercenaries fighting away from home.

&gt;The term was coined in 1688 by Johannes Hofer (1669–1752) in his Basel dissertation. Hofer introduced nostalgia or mal du pays ""homesickness"" for the condition also known as mal du Suisse ""Swiss illness"" or Schweizerheimweh ""Swiss homesickness,"" because of its frequent occurrence in Swiss mercenaries who in the plains of lowlands of France or Italy were pining for their native mountain landscapes. Symptoms were also thought to include fainting, high fever, indigestion, stomach pain, and death. Military physicians hypothesized that the malady was due to damage to the victims' brain cells and ear drums by the constant clanging of cowbells in the pastures of Switzerland.[9]
