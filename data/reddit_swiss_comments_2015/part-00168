null,false,xtoll,null,null,null,"My swissie just turned 8. When we were looking for a large dog, we liked berners (Bernese Mtn Dogs), but switched to looking for a swissie in part because swissies' short hair sheds much less than berners' long hair. (Plus, unlike some other large dogs, swissies do not drool! and that is a big plus. [But when I put her dinner bowl in front of her, the saliva literally runs out of her mouth if I hesitate before giving her permission to begin eating.]) As previously mentioned, there is the outer coat of hair a quarter inch up to an inch or so long (the colors you see) and the fuzzy wool-like undercoat. The outer coat doesn't shed much, although some would come loose during a bath. Since the undercoat is so fine and wool-like it (keeps swissies incredibly warm in frigid weather and) tends not to shed, but needs to be brushed out regularly. I've found a furminator used gently is great for removing loose undercoat. This reduces the very limited shedding to virtually nothing. 

Another difference we found is that swissies also tend to be more protective than berners--because swissies were bred not only to be a small draft animal, but also to ""guard the farm."" Our swissie enthusiastically alerts whenever anyone walks by. She can be quite fearsome and intimidating, but as the breed standard suggests they are very reluctant to bite--preferring instead to make a lot of noise and encourage strangers to go away. Ours has certainly never bit anybody, but they are 110-140 lb dogs and if allowed to, say, yap and behave uncontrolledly like a little dog, it would be scary. Our feeling was that the owners of a large, intimidating dog should via training and situation management work to ensure that strangers are not intimidated. Further, when company comes, we introduce them to her on the porch--before they come in the door--and then she'll be relaxed having them visit. And likely fall asleep with her head on their feet or something. A swissie typically will not be as relaxed and easy-going and as easy to live with as a golden or a lab.

Also, there are relatively few swissies in the U.S., compared with most other well-known breeds. There are good breeders, but you have to do some research to find them. And, when you find an excellent breeder, you'll probably need to request a puppy and wait up to six months or a year until one becomes available.",null,0,null,1430790928,null,0,false,0,cqynkip,null,t3_34s6rk,null,t1_cqynkip,null,t3_34s6rk,null,null,null,1432775999,null,1,false,SwissMountainDogs,t5_2vu9g,1,null
