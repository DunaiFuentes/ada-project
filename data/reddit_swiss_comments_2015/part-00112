Also, in Birmenstorf (not Birmensdorf) there is a tiny restaurant Alte Schmitte with a wood burning grill in their dining room that makes deliriously good steaks and thick-cut pork chops, with superb sides. I think they only have four or five tables, so a reservation is needed. But worth it. 

Zürich - increasingly, Fork and Bottle has climbed up my favorite list as an American-style restaurant. They have an incredible, well-curated beer selection, and a menu full of things that taste so good they should cure cancer. (Deep fried bacon!!!!) 

Neuchâtel - Muu is a very cow-themed restaurant that know the best way to put beef on a plate. Only had lunch there but definitely enjoyed it. 

Basel - Noonh has style for days and a strong Asian fusion menu. Went there for Valentine's this year and they jumped straight on my special occasion list.

In Berne, places that I'd recommend: Rosengarten (with a nice view of the old town), the bear park (which is just at the bottom of the Rosengarten). If you want another spectacular view: go to the university hospital (Inselspital), and take the elevator to the floor S1. There's a cafeteria with a spectacular view (if the weather is somewhat ok).  
Walk through the old town, I really like the Münster and the Münsterterrasse, but actually the old town is pretty nice everywhere. You can also see the Rathaus and the Bundeshaus and the Bundesterrasse on foot.  
If you have time, going to the Gurten is also nice for a view (I especially like it in the evening, when it's dark and you can see all the lights of the city). I think that the cable car that would take you up there is being worked on now...

I usually enjoy programming, so although I don't know anything about scala I'll consider taking parallel and reactive programming instead of Color Reproduction :)

The thing with Network security and Computer networks is that I need to take at least two of that kind (about networks) because the courses have to be similar to the ones in my university, and I couldn't find anything more interesting.

Thanks again!",null,0,null,1427329697,null,0,1427330388,0,cpqut0t,null,t3_308q8c,null,t1_cpqut0t,null,t1_cpqnh8k,null,null,null,1432016082,null,2,false,EPFL,t5_2svyx,2,null

Do you know about any course that is like a second part of Computer Networks? I couldn't find any, but if there were then I would go for that one instead. I actually went for Sécurité des réseaux because I don't know a thing about algorithms... so I might stay with that one.

I'll definitely take Software Engineering. I thought Human resources in project management would be better, good thing you told me :) 

And do you think I'd be able to take Parallel and Reactive Programming after taking Functional Programming as a MOOC? Like that I might as well consider taking Compiler Construction in fall.

So when taking the Parallel and reactive course they only have the fuctionnal programming mooc as scala background.
You should be fine.

Regarding Sécurité des réseaux there's a master course titled IT Security (actually split in two parts one is practice the other one is theory) which you could look for if you already have correct base in term of network security.",null,0,null,1427333191,null,0,false,0,cpqwtd3,null,t3_308q8c,null,t1_cpqwtd3,null,t1_cpqvpz1,null,null,null,1432017029,null,2,false,EPFL,t5_2svyx,2,null

Then you float down to wherever you are meeting your friends. Maybe Oetlingerbuvette or Florabuvette. The Buvettes are little bars that sell food and drinks and they're set up every 100 meters or so and are good meeting points. Usually people hang out at the Rhine until a little after sunset drinking beer and eating barbecue. I really recommend it.
