As I only have access to the mobile version, please person my editing.  

First of all, even though I am a doctor, I don't trust myself when it comes to form a personal opinion on how to rank drugs based on their hazard. So I surely won't trust you, based on your personal opinion. But in contrast I think It's interesting to see what experts on drugs from a few institutions like the NIH say. I linked 2 expert opinions on drugs hazard ranking so we can share a common ground on what we are talking about.   

So your ranking is not completely far from those of a few experts, except for weed...  
  
In order to have the authority to establish what is harmful or not we should have the correct epidemiological tools applied rightfully to the adequate population of druggies. Which neither of us has.   


I am myself biased, as I have seen enough weed addicts in my practice even though I recognize it does not seem to be a problem as big as cocaine or heroin. But again this is a personal view that is worthless in this context. As worthless as your personal experience of drugs in the context of your bright career.    

An a more personal note, bravo for your career.  And I have myself tried most of those that you put on the top o your list when I was a student except for DMT which I acknowledge it seems pretty cool. I don't spontaneously brag about it, but as we are talking about it...
