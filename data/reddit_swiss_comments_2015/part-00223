* Pilatus has imo a nicer view of lucerne and the lake. It's very touristy and kind of expensive. There is a new cable car but it's nothing special. It's possible to reach the top either by said cable car or by a cogwheel railway (the steepest in the world) from the other side (Alpnachstad). Thus you could do a round trip and have a ride by train or ship on the lake. Also, at the fräckmüntegg station 2/3 of the way up there is a tobogganing slide as well as a climb Park, but you'll need to check if it's open.

* Stanserhorn is a bit quieter and not so touristy. The view is nice too and it's probably less expensive. The cable car is special, as you can actually go onto the roof of the gondola while you ride up or down. But there's not really much else up there besides a nice view and the possibility for a round trip stroll of about an hour. For me, it's a less thrilling mountain, but nice nonetheless.
