Also other workers clearly have much higher salary and can compensate that. You compare a worker earning &lt;40k with workers earning about 100k. That makes a difference. Further, medical staff earning about the same has one weekend per month mandatory where they don't work three days in one row. Yes, there are anecdotal exceptions, but the rule is, they work as they can. Because most hospitals have much more workers than job percentage needed and they can swap. Most stores are on a limit now. 

You know that retail has the same amount of workers *like all you just described here* ?

And the power issue is relevant. I talked with a store manager selling electronics. If they had 24/7 he said he had to actually shed job percentage to pay for electricity. You know how much a megawatt-hour costs? Yes, nighttime is cheaper, but fixed costs with a clear trend upwards are the nightmare of business. This prisoners dilemma can be circumvented by simply banning such activities, so that no participant in the market has to care about that.

Regarding ""we can shut down our AKW"": show me the numbers. Also show me how more lights because of 24/7 culture fit in; show me how more mobility in off hours after 20:00 and before 04:00 because of that fit into Energiewende; show me anything and I believe you.
