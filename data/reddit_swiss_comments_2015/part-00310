&gt; In Switzerland, the cantons are primarily responsible for hospital planning. The cantons decide which hospitals are approved for the health insurance schemes on the basis of the criteria of efficiency and quality. In addition to this, the cantons create so-called hospital lists in which it is recorded which hospitals receive which performance mandate. A concentration of the service provision is pursued, through which the costs are reduced and the quality of the medical care can be increased.

&gt; Despite a range of accompanying measures such as the introduction of so-called fixed-sum treatment amounts with the financing of hospitals, until now, almost no hospitals have been closed. The sector is in agreement that there is an oversupply of hospital care in Switzerland, but in rural regions in particular, plans to remove a hospital from the cantonal list of hospitals – which in many places amounts to a closure – are regularly met with angry protests.

&gt; In addition to this, due to regional politics, the cantons continue to subsidise their own hospital infrastructure, which distorts the competition between the hospitals.

&gt; Switzerland is home to approximately 293 hospitals with 37,863 beds (as at 2013). The rate of capacity utilisation in acute-care hospitals is 80%, in regional hospitals 77% and in specialist clinics, 72%. This means the average utilisation is below the level of utilisation required for economically viable operations of approximately 85%.",null,0,null,1439323636,null,null,false,0,ctzjfin,null,t3_3gm79q,null,null,null,t3_3gm79q,null,null,null,1440420088,null,3,null,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3,null

null,null,Urgullibl,null,null,null,"Oh man, there is so much wrong with this question that it's hard to know where to start.

First of all, almost nobody farms conventionally any more, because there are no subsidies for that. The majority of farmers now do *Integrated Production* (hence the IP-Suisse label), which has requirements for how much of your livestock food you must grow yourself among other things. This has all but replaced conventional production nationwide.

Bio has additional requirements, notably regarding the use of pesticides in plant production, the waiting times for milk/eggs/meat after the use of medication (double of what's required by law), and the veterinary treatment of animals.

Let's start with plant farming. It's a luxury that we can afford because we have enough to eat (because Bio means lower crops per m^2 , as it's less efficient). There is no difference in nutritional quality between the crops, and people who claim they are able to taste a difference regularly fail in a blind test. If people want to pay more for it, let them, but I see no need for the State to subsidize luxury.

Second, the longer waiting times. There is no reason for those other than irrational fear. The legal waiting times are such that the medications are fully eliminated at the end. Waiting longer makes no measurable difference whatsoever and just makes the products more expensive to manufacture. Again, an inefficient luxury that isn't the State's business to support.

What really gets me going though are veterinary treatment requirements for Bio-labeled animal products. Biosuisse requires you to first try homeopathy on your animals, and only when that doesn't work, you're allowed to treat with medicine that actually has an effect. This results in needless suffering to the animals that is incompatible with any conventional view of animal welfare, and most certainly not the State's (nor any consumer's) business to support.",null,0,null,1439329569,null,null,false,0,ctznfrc,null,t3_3gm79q,null,null,null,t1_ctzmx8w,null,null,null,1440421976,null,3,null,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3,null

The religious people should be able to prevent gay church marriages. (My God hates you, so you're not allowed). There could be a religion that disallowed blue-eyed people from marrying brown-eyed people. If you join that religion, you follow their rules. (I think they should disallow divorcing, the thing being sacred and eternal)

For civil marriage, there should be different rules, and it should allow a wider range of marriages. There is nothing sacred about it, it's just the legal part, and gives all the rights and obligations. You can divorce if you don't like the obligations anymore. No need for love, no mandate to deliver babies on a yearly basis, no need to prevent gays from getting this one. No discrimination on race, sex, sexual orientation.

Religious people should object when we're voting about their sacred marriages, but they have nothing on the civil marriage. It's a boring administration-thing.

The problem is that marriage is a religious ritual and that we as a country have been stupid enough to attach special privileges to that religious act. We could for example also let the religious folks keep their marriage, remove any and all rights related to it and call the ""amtliche Heirat"" something else that is, of course, open to all.
