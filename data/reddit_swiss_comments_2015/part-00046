Lucerne: Activities:  cruise on the lake on one of the paddle steamers (ideally the whole way from Lucerne to Fluelen (come back by train)), visit to Mt Pilatus (go up the cable car and come down the cog railway), visit to Rigi (go up the cable car, come down the other side of the mountain on the other railway), walk in the old town, visit to the nearby transport museum. Throw in a day trip if you like to Engleberg and Mt Titlis. Mix and match according to your proclivities.

Take the train (longer Golden Pass route via Meiringen) to Interlaken.

Stay in nearby Lauterbrunnen (Staubbach falls). Take train to Wengen, cable car to Mannlichen, walk (5km glorius views) to Kliene Scheidigge, take the (expensive) train to Jungfrauhoch. On another day, take train from Wilderswil to Schinegg Platte. Day trip to Interlaken and its various activities. On another day, you can take the cable car to Grutschalp, walk to Murren and take the cable cars to Mt Schilthorn. Take an early morning walk from Lauterbrunnen to the within-mountain Trummelbach waterfalls. Take the bus back. This area (Bernese Oberlands) is Switzerland at its best.

Take the trains (a few changes) to Zermatt. 

Zermatt offers a host of activities. Riding cable cars to the mountain peaks. Taking the train to Gornergratt with a view of the Matterhorn and other 4000-metre peaks. A number of mountain walks (very easy to tough hikes).

If you want to ride the Glacier Express, you can then take it from Zermatt east to Chur.

Instead I suggest you to visit Bern, the capital of Switzerland (http://www.bern.com/en/index.cfm). Not only because it's my hometown, but also because the historic city centre is really unique and beautiful. You can easily spend a day there, watching the place, having a coffee (or beer) in one of the dozens of nice cafés, go shopping, whatever floats your boat. 

Main tourist attractions are the bear park in the middle of the city (free admission, http://www.baerenpark-bern.ch/) and the cathedral (""Münster"") with an awesome judgement day painting at the entry door. Also, on top of the cathedral tower you have an epic view over the city! Tourists like to visit the Einstein house (place where Albert Einstein developed his relavity theory) and the Paul Klee centre (mainly works of the painter Paul Klee, plus seasonal shows). 

If you are into beer culture, don't miss the Altes Tramdepot (http://www.altestramdepot.ch/htm/e_home.htm - they brew an excellent amber beer there) and the beer bar ""Au Trappiste"" (http://www.autrappiste.ch/), where you can choose from a selection of about 100 local and international beers.

For scenic views get yourself on the Gurten mountain, either hiking (2 hours max, easy walk) or by cable train. You'll find more hikes here: http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/top-hikes.html

- Pilatus Mountain, beware it is full of tourist all the time
- Interlaken and Brienz
- Jungfrau mountain
- Lauterbrunnen, is filled with all types of hiking trails and cable cars/trains
- Furkapass and Grimselpass

- Fribourg and its old city is nice
- Gruyère with its castle and Giger Museum (creator of Alien)
- Moléson Mountain, nice and all sorts of difficulties trails

Some scattered places worth mentioning
- Creux-du-Van near Neuchatel (for hiking)
- Schwarzsee, cute little place where you can do lots of activities like easy hiking, reant a canoe for the lake, get a lift to the top of the mountain and go downhill with a all terrain two wheels device
- Titlis, it seems they have some kind of high suspended bridge. Havent been there yet.
- if you venture your self to the Valais you have the Grand Dixence Dam, and Sanetsch mountain for hiking
And further south there is the beautiful Lugano and Locarno (with the nice Versasca Dam and river)

Just so you know, if there is a mountain or even a slope (lol) there is hiking trails with different kinds of difficulties (and probably cable cars/trains). You can search online for swiss trail signs for that
Most places you can hike from the bottom or take a transportation for a higher level.

If you are comming from Bregenz and you don't want to travel too far, I could recommend you the ""Heidiland"" (yeah, the Heidi story...), it has a very nice hiking routs and other activites as well.
(Personally I like Flumserberg too, but that's just a personal prefrence.)
 If it's raining for example (and this is very likely) I could recommend you this: http://www.taminatherme.ch/?gclid=CP-LytjWysMCFQXItAod53IA8Q
Those are hot springs with tempratures around 36 degree celcius.
(It also nice to visit the tamina gorge itsself.)

From there you can take the Train to Zurich. (1 hour train ride)
Zurich is probably the best place for nightlife-related stuff. (http://zuerich.usgang.ch/)
(Be warned, we are not the biggest party people, so better go there on a friday or saturday if you want to party...)
If your planning to go Zurich anyway, you should take a walk through ""Niederdörfli"", there are some of the oldest buildings in Zurich and one of the best burger restaurants ;)) (http://www.holycow.ch/ - recommended by students ;) )

Lucerne isn't far away (as always, think in trains) cou can take a beautiful boat tour there on the Lake. While you are there, you could always go to the Gletschergarden: http://www.gletschergarten.ch/

As many users already pointed out: Visiting Bern is always a good idea, there arn't as much tourists as in Lucerne and the old town is very lovely to see.
