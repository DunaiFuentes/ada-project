Here is a few things interesting to know  :
 
- A car is realy great, unless you live in a town (Monthey, Martigny, Sion, Sierre, Visp) public transport take a long time to move around especially if you come from a lateral valley

- Walliser are proud of the Wallis and willl make you know. We aint dick but we realy like Wallis

- We drink a bit, know your limit and stop if you go to parties because other people will most likelly not stop at any point.

It says that these banknotes I posted will be the new banknotes of Switzerland, but that the design might change a *bit** since it's still not definitive. Manuela Pfrunder designed them and got second place but some changes will happen to the design, since it's still not 100% definitive.

It will be pretty much these banknotes but with minor changes.

But, to be sure, you can always go to the Strassenverkehrsamt and ask what the deal is with that 1-year-rule (I just checked the PDF linked to below and couldn't find any mention of that rule). The only 1-year-rule I'm aware of is that you should get your Swiss driver's license within a year of moving to Switzerland.

Also: In case your Swiss permit is a small card (as opposed to the foldable one), then bring your appartment-lease-contract (or some other proof-of-address), since the small card doesn't have an address on it (why they decided it would be a good idea NOT to put the address on there is beyond me).",null,0,null,1439723676,null,null,false,0,cu4r2n3,null,t3_3h38qv,null,null,null,t1_cu4pdjz,null,null,null,1441280968,null,1,null,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1,null
