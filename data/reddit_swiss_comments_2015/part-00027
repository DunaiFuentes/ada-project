null,false,backgammon_no,null,null,null,"Just to add another voice to this - Swiss and Canadian culture are pretty superficially compatible, but deeply different. I'll just add a few of the subtle cultural differences which are not apparent unless you have made a concerted effort to join Swiss society. 



Be prepared to easily make small talk, understand how banking works, understand expectations of employers, co-workers, etc. Setting up casual nights out, behaviour in public places, etc will be the same as at home. Easy, day-to-day stuff is very similar to Canada. The government is structured differently but your interaction with the beaurocracy will be similar as well. 

However, be prepared to radically change your definitions of freindship, fairness, and even family. I can go into this in more detail if you like, but know that connections between Swiss people are formed far more slowly than in Canada and are far more fragile. You will find that people do not feel the obligations towards you that you may feel towards them - in terms of honesty, help out of difficulties, etc. Granted, the french-speaking cantons are more similar to Canada, but it is still difficult to find the level of warmth that, say, a Vancouverite would feel obligated to show a friend-of-a-friend. Maritime-style social life simply does not exist in Switzerland. 

Your wife will face a degree of sexism that is unimaginable to Canadians - in my work (at a federal research lab) I routinely witness behaviour that is frankly illegal in Canada. This is at a progressive institute. My wife works at a university here and her situation is worse. 

Racism. The word ""immigrant"" is rarely, if ever, used - the preferred nomenclature is ""foriegner"" in German and ""stranger"" in French. Unlike in Canada, even if you gain full-on citizenship, you will never be considered Swiss. The recent debates over immigration can take on a decidedly racist undertone, and even overtone in the case of extreme right wing parties. 

Anyways, I live in Switzerland, I married a Swiss woman, and I am basically happy here. However, hapiness has required *extreme* social adaptation.

null,false,backgammon_no,null,null,null,"&gt; Canadians are so high on the friendly scale that having someone being friendly to you means nothing.

Actually it confirms that you are enmeshed in a community that has your back. Daily / hourly reminders that you are not alone and need not fear isolation. 

&gt; Swiss people keep it distant, but then it becomes much more meaningful when you can have friendly interactions.

I more-or-less agree with this. A friendly move from a Swiss person does indeed let me know that they really value my company. However, that same move could have been made in Canada by, say, a minor work acquaintance, and so it doesn't make much of an impression on me.

**Braucht die Schweiz einen Staatsfonds? De quoi s‘agit it-il?**

Die Schweizerische Nationalbank (SNB) verteidigt seit 6. September 2011 die Untergrenze von 1.20 Franken pro Euro. Als Resultat sind die Devisenreserven stark angewachsen: per Ende August 2013 auf rund CHF 444 Milliarden.

Normalerweise legt die SNB ihre Reserven hauptsächlich (ca. 90%) in ausländische Anleihen von hoher Qualität (z.B. Deutschland), Sonderziehungsrechte (SZR) und Edelmetalle (Gold) an.

Um das Klumpenrisiko abzufedern, soll die Schweiz einen Staatsfonds gründen, der in Realwerte wie Aktien, Immobilien oder Rohstoffe investieren kann und so die Inflationsgefahr aus dem Euroland reduzieren kann.

**Nein! Warum?**

•  Nationalbank hätte genug Ressourcen, der Bund aber nicht, um einen Staatsfonds zu gründen. Die Nationalbank hat aber andere Ziele zu verfolgen als ein Staatsfonds.

•  Die Nachfrage nach ausländischen Währung, um im Ausland zu investieren, wird den Franken nicht schwächen. Die Investoren durchschauen das Spiel mit der künstlichen Verschuldung zur Schaffung eines Staatsfonds.

•  Die SNB hat das Klumpenrisiko Euro durch Anlagen z.B. in Singapur-Dollars, schwedischen und dänischen Kronen, australischen Dollars, und US-Dollars bereits stark reduziert. Zusätzlich hat sie die Aktienquote auf 10% erhöht. SNB hat mit Nokia rund EUR 50 Mio. Kursgewinne erzielt.

•  Ein Staatsfonds kreiert politische Begehrlichkeiten, was einem Missbrauch Tür und Angel öffnet.

•  Bis der Staatsfonds durch das Parlament geboxt würde, bräuchte es wahrscheinlich die Untergrenze nicht mehr.",null,0,null,1421924497,null,0,false,0,cnx324b,null,t3_2t61wk,null,t1_cnx324b,null,t3_2t61wk,null,null,null,1424466869,null,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2,null

**Sind SWFs demokratisch vertretbar?**
Ja, sofern die SWFs den Parlamenten gegenüber Rechenschaft ablegen.

**Wieso gibt es in westlichen Demokratien kaum Staatsfonds?**
Der Bedarf ist nicht vorhanden. Die meisten westlichen Länder haben ausgebaute Sozialwerke und gut entwickelte Volkswirtschaften ohne Klumpenrisiken in einzelnen Branchen. Ausserdem verfolgen Demokratien einen liberalen Ansatz, der besagt, dass die Anpassungen über normale Marktkräfte vollzogen werden müssen. Die bekanntesten sind in Norwegen, Frankreich, Kanada und Australien.
