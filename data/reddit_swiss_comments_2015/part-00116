To have a reason like ""it's wealthy"" sounds like a disaster to me. You're not here for an overnight trip, you want to go all in and get a job.

I hired plenty of people from serbia and other countries but only because swiss people didn't have the qualifications and we had to even prove that to the authorities (programmers with masters degrees), it's a long and ugly process most of the time and you still better be a hard worker.

Also if you want to work a low wage job you pretty much compete with everyone from eastern europe and other countries that are probably ready to do this kind of work for less and harder than you do.

Other people have suggested it, try to get a job before you come here or don't come at all, it seems hard for you to save up 1'000.-- or let alone 1'500.-- and you may very well strand with that little amount here, much quicker than you think.
