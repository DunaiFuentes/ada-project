* Rent is stupidly high. There's no way around that. You might want to live in a flat share.
* You don't need a car. In fact, don't even think about it. Traffic is an absolute nightmare. When the sun goes up, the traffic jam is there. When the sun goes down, it's still there. I honestly don't know why anyone bothers.
* Get a bike or use public transport. There's buses and trams to and from everywhere pretty much every five minutes.
* It pays off to live near a major train station, because then you will have trains all the way through the night. Oerlikon and Altstetten aren't bad ones.
* Just because you don't live in the city centre does not mean you're living far away from everything. The so-called Agglo, which appears to be describing places that used to be independent but have been annexed due to Zürich's massive growth, is very well-connected.
* Even the cheap food is high quality here due to legislation.
* It's worth to check out the Arabic and Asian supermarkets.
* Learn German
* The regular expat haunt appears to be a bar called The International at Luisenstrasse. It's run by an Englishman and serves over 100 kinds of beer.
* If you want to save money, like spending-on-hobbies money, just put all coins in your pockets aside every night. Put them in a big bowl or something and you'll have a lot of cash saved up in no time.
* This is important: Learn German. Take classes. Adopt Swiss German expressions. Otherwise you might end up being very, very lonely
** The thing with the local expat scene is this: It's small and tight. But there's this frame of mind where a lot of them treat this country and the people therein - even fellow expats - as a stop along the way to elsewhere.  So acquaintances are fleeting
