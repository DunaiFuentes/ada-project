Hmm, this winter we will have some bad snow storms (as warned) and you need to drive/bus somewhere, well fuck you we didnt buy enough salt to take care of the road because that one guy with the shovel at the intersection will do all the work.

Ah yes, you want to buy a bike in november?

What I meant is that you don't have better chances or a higher salary solely because you have a US education (except maybe if you have an ivy league MBA). There is plenty competition around here with highly educated people.

If you want to work in Switzerland probably your best option would we to join an international company (like the Big4) and see if you can internally transfer to a Swiss subsidiary. Alternatively build some work experience and then apply for a position in Switzerland because nobody here will hire a fresh graduate who is not a Swiss or EU resident simply for the fact that there are enough other candidates.

A completely different route would be to marry a Swiss :-)
