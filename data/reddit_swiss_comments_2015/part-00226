My argument has multiple premises that we have to agree upon or else it won't make sense. So I'll be listing them.

1) Do you agree that big gaps in equality is a social problem and we have to create ways to lessen that gap?

2) Do you agree that no tax makes ""sense"" in terms of: There is nothing logic about paying part of what you win/own when you work/consume?

3) Do you agree that the most powerful thing about living in an organized society is having the possibility to make more than if you would be alone? In a lot of instances, health care, science, art, etc...

4) Do you agree that reward effort is a driving force of our society and that we should enforce that notion?

If you agree on those 4 premises, I think you will agree with my argument. If not, I'll gladly discuss the ones that don't make sense to you and try to find why we disagree on them.

Now my argument: The main tool that our society has to reduce the gap between people in terms of wealth is taxes. Since society has to find ways to help everyone thrive, taxing wealth when you die is a low ""reset"" on people who have parents who have a lot of wealth. Because, why should I get such a big head start from my parents with their wealth? I have not earned it since I just got lucky. I have to earn my way up, not win from the start, sit back and relax.

null,false,xxn10,null,null,null,"Point 1 and 4 are contradicting. Or do you want to say there is reward to effort, but only until this line and no further?

Point 2: Taxes MAKE sense, the state offers you legal security and stability, infrastructure etc. In return you pay taxes for these benefits. The point of taxes is not and should not be to reduce the gap between people, but pay for the upkeep of the country and society. 


Why should there be a ""reset""? The closest bond a human has is his family and his ""line"". Parents have always worked to give their kids a better life than they had etc. 

You may ask how someone ""deserves"" to inherit the fortune of their parents or what right they have to it. But what right does the state have to take it away? 

Every person should and can decide on their own what will happen with their money and property, if they think their children deserve it then fine, if they want to give it to the state or some organization, fine. 

But the state taking a big chunk of your money when you die, money that was already taxed, is complete nogo.

I'll need you to answer so that I can respond accurately. And could you break up your answer in simple A linked to B so that's its less intertwined. Having a debate is already hard enough when you write :P

A) Taxes are useful in the way you describe, but what I meant is that there is no ""logic"" in a tax. There is a logic to pay for upkeep/work/etc, but the concept of having a third guy take 1% of what you paid your gardener is not logic to me. If I would pay as a service whatever the society upkeep costs, it would make sense. Do you see what I mean? The only reason I point it out is to get rid of the ""Taxing a dead man doesn't make sense"" argument which to me is applicable to any tax.

B) The law proposed to tax 20% of anything that was higher than 2million. Meaning that if your parents gave you 3million, you would have to pay 200'000, which, I think, is quite affordable and you would not be hindered to offer something to your children.

C) The government has no more right to take the money than anyone else. Linked to the ""no sense"" argument in taxing. Another thing, in Switzerland, we are the government, so if we decide that rich people have to get taxed, we give the right to ourselves. What's the right for a policeman to stop me from killing my neighbor? It's the same thing.

C) I don't agree on the fact that you can do whatever you want with your money. There are laws to protect citizens against citizens/corporations/government. I would not accept that you use your money to get someone to kill me for instance. The law also represents what you can do or not in society.

D) The ""double"" taxation argument is linked to my point 2), on tax makes sense. Taxing once doesn't make more sense than taxing 15 times.",null,0,null,1434386659,null,0,false,0,cs7btbe,null,t3_39sevm,null,t1_cs7btbe,null,t1_cs7axim,null,null,null,1437022142,null,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2,null
