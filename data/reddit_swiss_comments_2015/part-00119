&gt; It should matter more what you use it for.

Well some people use guns to kill other people. That's the whole point. And of course the purpose matters. Try to make a school massacre or murder your family with a skateboard or a bike... I'm not any expert but I'm pretty sure it's not as efficient as a gun. Why? Because the gun was build to kill people. Even gasoline is tricky to cause a lot of harm. It's fairly obvious if you show up with a gasoline truck and start pouring it all over the place.

&gt; Neither is the primary use of weapons.

Did a unicorn tell you this? No seriously, guns are design to harm people (and animals). It's pretty absurd to claim something else. Just read a book or something...

&gt; I don't know. I cannot say. I have never been in a society where there are no guns whatsoever. I have only seen a movie once where only police and military had guns.

Ever heard of the UK? Your not really allowed to own a gun unless it's clearly related to your job. Most police officers don't have guns. They did this because some idiot killed a ton of children in a school. And guess what? He didn't use a skateboard or a bike...

&gt; With cars you can do that (not only for having fun, but for helping the economy). You just have to have insurance. Otherwise why would you allow 2 tons faster than a horse in public?

Cars are mainly legal because the mobility of labor brings advantages to firms. Of course it's also used for leisure but that's simply because the alternatives are limited (e.g. banning all not work related commutes would make it uneconomic to buy a car and hence cause all kind of negative effects).

&gt; But enough car analogies, I think they are bad analogies.

I actually agree with that because I do think that cars should be heavier regulated too. It's not okay that other people (e.g. pedestrians, children) die just so that other people can drive faster. It's the same concept as with guns.

* Ich heisse - The ""ch"" in ""Ich"" sounds really like when you try to hiss like a cat. As for ""heisse"": You pronounce ""hei-"" like a very short version of ""hi"" and ""-ss-"" like the 's' in ""I see..."" and the ""-e"" is really short as in the english word ""extra"".

null,false,unbanpabloenis,null,null,null,"Habe das hier in einem Forum gefunden: ""Hanf samen sind in der Schweiz legal, wenn der Staat nicht davon ausgehen muss, dass der Besitz dem Anbau von Rauschgift dient. Wenn du also bei der Kontrolle ein Bob Marley Shirt trägst: nicht gut. Im Prinzip überlässt dies Bundesgesetz es dem Ermessen der kantonalen Behörden, Samenbesitz zu verfolgen oder eben nicht. Ähnlich wie bei der Festlegung dessen, was ""geringfügige Mengen"" sind. In einem Kanton war schon ein Gramm nicht mehr geringfügig (Solothurn), ein anderer Kanton (Basel) befand, 4 Kilo Gras seien geringfügig - was allerdings das Bundesgericht negierte.

Theoretisch können sie dich wegen Seeds verklagen und sie dir wegnehmen. In der Praxis sieht es zur Zeit so aus, als liesse man die Grower in Ruhe, damit der Schwarzhandel von der Selbstversorgung verdrängt wird, was ja eigentlich gut ist. Das kann sich aber schnell ändern. Zudem gibt es noch den Aspekt, dass bald über die Hanf-Initiative abgestimmt wird. ""Der Staat"" versucht nun offensichtlich durch viel Toleranz, den Kiffern den Wind aus den Segeln zu nehmen, im Sinne von ""ist ja gar nicht nötig"".

Was die Datensicherheit der Growshops betrifft, so kann ich nur berichten von dem Fall eines bekannten Zürcher Shops, wo die Polizei mehrfach versuchte, an die Kundendaten heranzukommen, inklusive unangekündigte Hausdurchsuchungen.

Erinnert euch auch an die Sache mit den Kundendaten von Lichtensteiner Banken... Könnte hier auch leicht passieren, was in der Art. Vor allem, wenn die Regierung mal eben etwas Action und einen Sündenbock für die 20 Uhr News braucht. Haschisch-Fixer-Hatz...nichts neues, wie wir wissen.

Grundsätzlich lässt sich sagen: Selbstversorgung und Grow-Shops werden heute mehr oder weniger toleriert, man sollte aber weder seine Plants noch seine Seeds einem Beamten unter die Nase reiben! Der müsste sie dann wegnehmen.

PS Nachtrag: Tipp zum Umgang mit Kundendaten: Wer online Seeds kauft und per Kreditkarte bezahlt, hinterlässt eine Spur, die alle möglichen Schnüffeldienste weltweit ausspähen können. Dass die Polizei aber Kreditkartendaten bei solch relativen Bagatelldelikten verwendet, ist zumindest heute noch eher unwahrscheinlich. Sicherer wäre es auf jeden Fall, die Seeds anonym und persönlich im Ladenlokal zu kaufen. Oder online Bestellung mit Cash Vorkasse. Auf jeden Fall solltet ihr den Growshop anweisen, eure Kundedaten sofort nach Transaktion und Versand zu löschen.""",null,0,null,1427805993,null,0,false,0,cpwl4rn,null,t3_30wwm5,null,t1_cpwl4rn,null,t3_30wwm5,null,null,null,1432114853,null,9,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,9,null

But since ten years or so, hemp seeds which give growth to plants with a THC content of more than some ridiculously small percentage are illegal to sell/buy (before, seeds and seedlings were exempted). You can buy seeds for nutrition [here](https://www.nu3.ch/govinda-bio-hanfsamen-geschaelt-150-g.html) for example.

As for the interrogation, the police will try to get you for as much wrongdoing as you admit (as much as possible). Right now, the only thing they've got on you is the attempt to import seeds (in order to prove that they are of a variety with high THC content, they would need to grow the plants I suppose...). The worst you will get is a small fine or community service. If, on the other hand, you admit to planning to grow narcotics from the seeds, to using narcotics regularly, or anything else illegal, they will add this to the accusation (Anklageschrift). You can guess what I'd recommend you to do...

PS If you ever think about ordering again, pay with prepaid and don't order from Holland (Spain is better, less controls).
