null,false,throwawayengineer473,null,null,null,"While I respect your opinion as a doctor, I have tried various ones on myself and documented their effects. My findings report the following about drugs:

1. Phenethylamines have a higher potential for vasoconstriction and stimulant effects. Sweating, tremors, temperature sensitivity are common with these. 2,5-dimethoxy (2C) series causes more temperature sensitivity and wave-like effects. A few exhibit MAOI effects, particularly when a sulfur-based group is on the #4 position of the benzene ring, which gives rise to the ALEPH and 2C-T-* series. 2C-T-7 is infamous for being a potent MAOI when insufflated, but **relatively** okay when taken orally, so long as nothing else is taken with it. I cautioned those taking 2C-T-2 from insufflation for similar reasons, and strongly advised they stick to an oral dosage.

2. Cannabis can cause dependence (and in that sense, psychological addiction) in some users, but its sudden cessation of usage is not necessarily physically harmful like it would be with benzodiazepines or prolonged usage of opiates. Thus, because of those factors, and the fact that both of those it is compared against for anxiety and pain management respectively, I believe it to be a safer (and possibly less-effective) alternative based on that factor. Coupled with that there is still no definitive lethal dosage known, and very few (if any) drug interactions. Maybe SSRIs and MAOIs have adverse reactions with cannabis, but I have yet to see many reports of that - you're the doctor though, I am sure you might have better access to that sort of thing than I do.

3. Tryptamines have the lowest risk as a whole, in terms of dose-lethal dose ratio. For instance, DMT and LSD are well over 100x the lethal dose to an active dose. Psilocybin is up there too. The only ones that I have seen that go against this, so far, are the 5-Methoxy derivatives of tryptamines, which do pose some risk at higher doses, but most users wouldn't be inclined to seek such high doses. For example, once I gave someone 5-MeO-MiPT that was active at about 5-8mg, and they asked for 18. 12mg didn't work for them, and so I gave them about 15mg - past 20mg is where there are a lot more incidents of hospitalization, and thus, the closer they got to that dosage, the more weary I was. I digress, but an interesting note for sure, no?

I believe the FDA (I could be wrong, I know it was some authoritative organization involved with medicine) said that MDMA should be schedule 3 instead of schedule 1, citing medicinal purposes and low-moderate potential for addiction, and safe clinical usage when pharmaceutically pure. 

LSD treats and prevents cluster headaches at a high efficacy rate (though I am sure sumatriptan has a pretty good efficacy rate as welll), and also treats alcoholism effectively at nearly 48% efficacy rate. Psilocybin, while pharmacologically and structurally different, also has similar results - both are based off the indole molecule (but that's not to say that K2/Spice/Synthetic Weed would have similar results, as it is also based off indole).

And yes, neither of us have the tools, and rudimentary science can only have so much legitimacy. But yet, what's to keep someone from studying how medical studies are done, and doing it in a sort of black-book, off-the-official-research way? It takes about 30 samples for a population to be considered statistically valid at lower estimates, and can increase much more from there. Luckily, places like Erowid.org have reports of people trying NUMEROUS things, and can act as a primary source in many senses - you read enough reports, you get the gist of the timeline and what the compound does, and it even records what other things you had done in combination with the substance in question.

DMT, so far, is the only compound I know of which is safe to combine with an MAOI, and SSRI, an SNRI, or sober. I think weed would almost match, but I'm almost positive there's a complex tryptamine embedded somewhere in its 400+ chemicals which might cause an adverse reaction to an MAOI, but that has yet to be seen either. Not going to rule it out, though.

And as to why I brought up a dead thread? I was bored, used a search bar, was drunk, and gave my input on a topic I feel passionate about. Plus I'm kind of the 'go-to' guy for illegal drug information from my friends, so I tell them what pharmacological interactions are ill-advised (SSRIs and MAOIs as a categorical imperative are not good combinations, especially if either's usage has been within 2 weeks of the current drug's usage).",null,0,null,1432877724,null,0,false,0,croj8au,null,t3_2xpa1r,null,t1_croj8au,null,t1_crnvpb8,null,null,null,1433329740,null,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1,null
