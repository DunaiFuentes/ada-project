Just a few kilometers across the border to France or Germany, they have fresh bread that they toast well, meat fresh from the grill, homemade sauces, fresh salad. And they put them together like they actually give a fuck: Some sauce on the bread first, them some meat, some veggies, more meat, more veggies and top it off with not to much sauce.

Come back home, and it's shitty industrial bread, barely toasted with meat from the warming bin and sauces that are bought from cash &amp; carry. And they just randomly slap the stuff together. It's absolutely terrible!

And the meat! Almost all Döner places here have minced meat on their Döner rather than real slabs of meat laid on top of each other.

I dream of getting good Döner in Switzerland!

The only passable place in Berne is King's Kebab, the little white house in the intersection by the Lorraine bus stop. Nice guys, properly toasted bread, and real meat slabs so the meat has the proper texture. But they also do the warming box thing, and the sauce is kind of bland.

Fast- and streetfood is generally terrible in Switzerland though. People who sell it mostly give no fucks about their product. It's a discrace.
