Here's the bottom line though, gun violence only takes a small percentage of overall violent crime. Meaning that you have more a risk of being a victim with a blunt object or knife used against you, then a gun being used against you. 

There are three primary arguments against guns:

1: guns are deadly and people shouldn't have that kind of power

To which I say sure, take guns away! But strip military and police and all government officials from firearm use. Until that happens, there should be no reason the government should have absolute control over the lives of its people. History shows us what happens when corrupt governments have that kind of power. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. 

2: There is no reason to own a gun since guns primary use is to kill

Except police response time to 911 calls (or the equivalent) can be more then 5 minutes. We have the right of self preservation, and if someone has the intent to come after me, I should be able to defend myself. I shouldn't have to rely on the police to take 10 minutes to discover a messy crime scene because someone was left defenseless and the criminal, being a criminal and all, didn't follow the gun ban and had a firearm of his own. Plus hunting is a vital part to healthy conservation. 

3: We should ban guns to save lives from gun violence. 

If your intent is to save lives, then ban cars. We can improve public transportation, and car accidents kill more people then guns. Ban swimming pools, public pools with proper supervison is more then enough to ensure a safe experience, since swimming pool deaths outnumber firearm deaths. This list can go on because quite frankly, alot of things in society are extremely dangerous and result in alot of deaths. We could certainly ban and put tighter regulation to make us safer, but it's a price we pay to have more individual freedoms as a people. 

Firearms have their use, and you are right that they are deadly, but in the reason of individual freedom, self preservation and more importantly to maintain a balance between a government and it's people, people should have the right to them. If you feel these main reasons are not valid, that's your own prerogative, but they certainly are valid for a majority of people.

null,false,Dcoil1,null,null,null,"I see your argument, like you've mentioned in other arguments, that a car is not designed to kill people. However, you're proposing that you introduce speed limits of 20 or 30km/h in cities in villages. ~~Now, I'm not sure what country you reside in, but~~**(Edit: I see that this was posted in /r/switzerland, my apologies)** many towns/villages/public centers already have low speed limits. For example, the town I grew up in, about 10,000 people, had a main highway that was maximum 45 mph (~72 kmh) and surface streets that were 25/35 mph (40/56 kmh).

But lets compare apples to apples for a second, in that car = gun, metaphorically. You propose that guns should be outlawed completely, because they are dangerous. If we use the metaphoric comparison, this would mean cars should be outlawed completely.

For cars, you say we should regulate the speed at which drivers can drive their cars. In the comparison, this is similar to guns in that guns *are* limited in their usage. Most population centers have outlawed the use of firearms within their city limits, slightly akin to lowering the speed in in a populated area (the direct comparison would be to outlaw cars in cities altogether). In many county areas, unincorporated land not within city limits, firearms are allowed to be used as long as they maintain the mandated safe distance (1/4 mile from any road or structure where I am from) from any road or structure and do not pose a threat to any nearby residents (meaning not being shot in the direction of anyone outside that safe distance). This, again using the car comparison, would be similar to opening up the speed limit to a higher speed once you have left the populated area. For those who live in populated areas, designated public shooting ranges are often used to still be allowed to enjoy firearms, but those are monitored by range safety officers and are cleared by the local municipality for construction, so once again, they are regulated.

Firearms enthusiasts, similar to motorists, are required to be safe with the operation of their firearms, especially when the population density is much higher. Some states, like with motorists, require those who own guns to acquire a license before purchasing them. Some states (and certain cities separate from their home state) ban a magazine capacity over a certain limit (generally 10 rounds). In the metaphoric comparison, this would be akin to forcing motorists to have a speed governor installed on their car that would only allow it to travel say ~45mph maximum. The car is designed to go well beyond 100mph, but it is governed down to ~45mph, which I wholly assume no one would volunteer to do.

Finally, like motorists, it is only those who are *unsafe* and *unlawful* with their vehicles that hurt others, make headlines and sully the name of firearm owners. While we have many laws and regulations in place, as well as hefty punishments, there are still those that choose to drive recklessly, drink and drive, or use their vehicles for other nefarious means other than it's designed intention. That, of course, occurs all over the world, not just in America. My argument then, again comparing guns to cars metaphorically, that banning the outright ownership of them does little to change the effects of those that use them irresponsibly or unlawfully, and that those bad apples shouldn't dictate the doctrine used for the group as a whole.",null,0,null,1427852045,null,0,false,0,cpxcqak,null,t3_30oppe,null,t1_cpxcqak,null,t1_cpx19zy,null,null,null,1432128005,null,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2,null
