null,false,whitepalms85,null,null,null,"The main issue in Switzerland is that it's a totally divided society. Basically there are younger, well educated people in the cities that want to be part of a global world whereas a lot of older people that are struggling with globalization what to isolate the country and refuse change. This becomes most clear when the country debates the relationship with the EU and immigration. 27% of the people vote for a far right wing party that absolutely hates the EU and all immigrants. At the same time like quarter of the people vote for left wingers that officially have the goal to 'overcome capitalism'. There is a massive abuse of direct democracy going on too. Basically politics in Switzerland is very populist and they constantly propose ridiculous referendums on which the people have to vote. Usually they get rejected but recently a referendum passed that would limit immigration from the EU. Unfortunately, limiting immigration violates the contracts with the EU, on which Switzerland depends and the EU doesn't want to renegotiate the contracts. So basically the people were so stupid that they managed it to completely hurt themselves. And the government is screwed too because this nonsenses is in our constitution now (no joke!?! I know...) and they are forced to do something they can't really do. Also most Swiss actually want to keep the contracts with the EU (without them the economy would fall into a crisis) but also limit migration, which completely contradicts itself. 
You should read [Switzerland–European Union relations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland%E2%80%93European_Union_relations)

Other issues are the strength of the Swiss franc. The central bank pegged the exchange rate at 1.2 to the Euro as the strong increase of the Swiss franc during the crisis jeopardized the export economy. However, like 3 month ago before the ECB announced QE they got cold feed and removed the peg. The FX rate is almost at 1:1 to the Euro now making all the Swiss ~20% richer relative to Euro countries citizens but also all exports 20% more expensive. So now the economy is expected to grow only very little this and next year. That said, Switzerland is very rich and a 'crisis' like this is nothing compared to what a crisis is in other countries. E.g. it's absolutely normal that all graduate in Switzerland find jobs within reasonable amount of time. A crisis just means 'you wont get your dream jobs and/or you have to search a bit longer'.

The aging population is also a big issue (but not often talked about as most voters are old). Basically the baby boomers are all going to retire and will massively increase public health care costs and costs for retirement benefits. This generation didn't produce enough children so now a relatively small work force of young people has to pay more and more for big group of old people. The problem could be partially solved by letting more young, well educated foreigners in (like the Germans) but, as pointed out before, a lot of people are very hostile towards foreigners so they reject this idea.

A cultural issue in Switzerland is that the people are complacent and arrogant. Most Swiss think it's normal to be rich and have no clue how life is even in other European countries. Most also think that they are something better than other cultures and that the wealth of Switzerland proofs that. They wont show you this though, the Swiss are very understatement. But basically the Americans are all loud idiots that think bigger is better, Southern Europeans are all lazy (that's why they are poor), Eastern Europeans are all petty criminals because they aren't good for anything else and so on...

Also most Swiss are in total denial of what I just told you. They think Switzerland isn't racist/xenophobic because the fact that 25% of the people here are foreigners proofs this. In reality foreigners are denied political rights/citizenship for over 13 years even if you behave well, pay taxes, create jobs... ultimately people will vote on you whether you get citizenship and if you live in countryside village you're screwed because they hate foreigners and will deny it. You will never be Swiss, not matter how long you live here. Even if you are from a different canton and move to e.g. Zurich (which is actually quite open-minded), you will still be considered 'foreign'. 
Along with that it's also that most Swiss think that they are the most democratic country on the planet and that the more people vote the better. They look even down on other (more) democratic countries.
And those topics are both pretty much tabu. You're not supposed to say that Switzerland is xenophobic or that the democratic system is terribly designed.",null,1,null,1429215996,null,0,1429218216,0,cqepvm2,null,t3_32tzs8,null,t1_cqepvm2,null,t3_32tzs8,null,null,null,1432431629,null,11,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,11,null
