At least that's what I seem to see as somebody who lives in Zürich for a long time, but wouldn't call myself a 'real' Zürcher.

SVP currently has 30% percentage of the votes (as of the 12 this month), which is slightly higher than average for Switzerland, taking up 54 seats (out of 180) in the cantonal parliament. They enlisted the help of CVP and FDP making FDP-SVP-CVP the majority. ZH is deffo not as progressive as they want to be...
