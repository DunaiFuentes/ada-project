null,false,ugottabekiddinme,null,null,null,"Hey there! I am Swiss and I know the field. Maybe I can help. I will tell you what you would have to do at Swiss Universities. To know if the degree you have will be ok to teach in Switzerland and to check what courses you might have to take here, I would check with the haute école pédagogique you would like to attend. http://www.cohep.ch/fr/hautes-ecoles-pedagogiques/hautes-ecoles-pedagogiques-en-suisse/ But: here comes the tricky part... In some cities (like Zurich where I am), to be a High School (as in gymnase) teacher, the courses for the teaching diploma are at the University, not the ""Pädagogische Hochschule""/""Haute Ecole Pédagogique"". I don't know how it is in the Romandie. 

Ok, so here goes what you have to do in Switzerland normally, to be a Gymnasiallehrer/Prof de gymnase: You will have to do a masters degree in the field you would like to teach. It can also be two different matters - but then you would probably have to make sure you have taken enough courses/seminars/credit points in the second field too. For instance, I studied French and History, both are taught in Gymnase. Sometimes you can also teach in a field related to the one you studied but then you may have to take additional courses/credits.

THEN: In a second step (the two can overlap though) you have to get a Gymnase teacher's diploma. This is called ""Lehrdiplom für Maturitätsschulen"" at my University. Maybe, if you are sure you would like to teach in Switzerland and stay here, it would be easier to do this diploma here too. You are allowed to start teaching before you have the diploma (everybody does it, it is even recommended) and the salary is good also then (at least in my canton). You can even start to teach before you have your first degree. I did that and for me, it was a good experience.

What might have caused some of the confusion you encountered: things might vary between cantons quite a bit. As I told you, in between cantons you don't get the teacher's diploma at the same kind of school - for instance: University in Zurich, Pädagogische Hochschule (in french HEP) in Berne or Kreuzlingen. But what is sure (with maybe a few exceptions) is that the masters degree has to be one of a University or equivalent, not of a type of school called ""Fachhochschule"" here (don't even know the term in French but could check for you). 

If you have further questions feel free. I am happy to help if I can. Also, I speak French even though I don't live in the French speaking part of Switzerland. 

edit: I just read the other comment. I don't agree with it. But I must say: depending on the field you would be applying for, it will be difficult to get a job. History for instance... My husband is a historian (main field of his studies). He didn't get a job as a history teacher and I know of others who struggled (he teaches something else now but of course had to take additional credits).  English, I don't know. Probably more difficult than math or french but hopefully feasible.

May I ask a few questions:

I find it a bit strange too to move to a country without the motivation to learn the local language. For me (as for my friends), it doesn't have to be perfect and doesn't have to be Swiss German. I will happily switch to High German or to English to communicate. But I once met a guy who had been in Switzerland since two years and he was barely able to say ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" in any of our national languages... That's weird, isn't it? English is a foreign language for us - I find it strange when people think that we HAVE to speak it with them but on the other hand don't want to learn our language. Also, not every Swiss person speaks English well.

As for the dialects: I assume you are speaking of the Swiss German ones. This doesn't concern OP so much because he wants to move to the Romandie. The Swiss French doesn't vary much from canton to canton. The Swiss German though does vary... but it is mostly perfectly mutually intelligible. Don't know what you are talking about.

In Ireland, where I'm from, you can't do a masters in two subjects, only one, so I'm confused on how that would equate to Switzerland. Switzerland recognises my degree under the Bologna process, so it has to be feasible to study in Ireland for the masters, even ifit would be better in Switzerland. 

Tesol is an MA which focuses on the development of English language teaching. It's typically what one does if one is an ESL/EFL teacher.

CELTA is a worldwide accredited certificate to teach English to adults and children. I have 16 months experience of English language teaching already.

Can I study my masters in a Swiss university through English? 

I haven't decided what masters to do. I didn't expect an English masters to be useful if I will only be teaching the language, because in English speaking countries a masters in English is only literature.

null,false,ugottabekiddinme,null,null,null,"Hey there! Ok, I understand a bit more now.

I don't want to bum you out. But to teach English in High School you will have to have done courses in linguistics too besides of literature. I am sure you can do that also afterwards (you will probably also have to do that to complete what would be required for a bachelor I am afraid) but it will be more work. I understand that you have much more knowledge in literature than a Swiss student - but yeah, linguistics is still required... Mayyybe you can try to have some of the extra literature credits count for your masters here. Would be quite a bit of luck if they accepted though. (But one can always ask.)

Yes, in Switzerland it is possible to do a masters in two fields. It's what I have done although in the system before Bologna. But even now it is possible (and common). You will have a main subject and one or two secondary subjects. Not sure about the terminology of it in English or French. It is also possible now to have two main subjects I think.

It is normal for future teachers to get the teaching diploma for two matters. But it can also be done for only one. 

It might be an option for you to come to Switzerland directly to do your masters in English and History (bonus would be an improvement of your French). Then you can still decide if you want to get the diploma for one or two matters. As I mentioned in another comment, getting a job as a History teacher is really tough. 

I am not sure if it would be possible to only study English. I think a second field of study will be mandatory, but I am not sure...

University is not that expensive in Switzerland, it's the rest of the costs that sum up quickly... University is around 800CHF per semester I think (not sure if it is different for foreigners but don't think so). But as I said, the living costs are quite high compared to other countries.

&gt; I've heard university is exceptional but expensive, is it possible for foreigners to get student loans?

University is really cheap if you compare it to the US. You pay less than 1000 CHF / semester. Currently it's the same for everyone. It might become more expensive for foreigners in the future.

&gt; I was thinking about going to Geneva or somewhere in the french speaking part of Switzerland because my german ist nicht gut. Considering i'm fluent in french and english that may give me a leg up in the job market as well, again correct me if i'm wrong.

Most university educated young Swiss are fluent in English and either French, German or Italian. If you don't want to work for McDonalds or the likes, your bilingually is unlikely to give you a leg up.

&gt; I'm thinking of majoring in finance or commerce so is geneva good for that or should I go to Bern or Zurich instead?

If Geneva doesn't work out, I'd advise you go to Lausanne. There's two good universities and imo it's a nicer city than Geneva anyway.

&gt; Is the rent expensive in big cities? (I'm guessing it's on par with paris)

I don't know about the rent in Paris, but yes, living in the center of a major Swiss city is on the expensive side.

As a Schengen citizen, you can live, work and study in Switzerland without a permit. Realistically speaking, this is highly unlikely to change anytime soon.

&gt; I've heard university is exceptional but expensive, is it possible for foreigners to get student loans?

University is cheaper than in the US, but more expensive than in France. Depending on your university and what you study, tuition can go up to ~2000 CHF per semester in the medical professions; however, most other subjects are cheaper.

Talk to your university about the possibility of obtaining financial aid (""stipendium"").

There really isn't much of a hierarchy between Swiss universities. However, St. Gallen has an excellent reputation in economics.

Geneva is more expensive than Paris.

Knowing German will certainly give you an additional edge in the job market.

&gt; How long does it take to obtain a swiss citizenship and will I have to do military service if I do get one?

Long enough that military service won't be something you'll have to think about by the time you obtain citizenship.

&gt; I hear people make good money there and the the taxes are low so this makes living there all the more interesting.

That is generally correct. Keep in mind that cost of living is high, and health insurance is not government-administered and thus not covered by your taxes.
