That's exactly my point! In Switzerland it's like that! 

Go to Italy and see for yourself how much the consiglieri regionali earn and the privileges they enjoy, especially in Sicily. Then go ask the people how they'd like a constitutional initiative that sets a max wage for politicians (e.g. the same wage as people on the lower limit of the XX% upper percentile of income, based on fiscal data, this would make politicians make an effort to fight tax evasion for once) or bans annuities unrelated to the money actually contributed to the pension fund. 
You don't know much about Italy and have never spoken to italian people and observed their politics in a continous way otherwise you'd agree that direct democracy would help them (and not the non-binding referendums they sometimes did in the past and that were often not respected, and had quorums too, basically eliminating freedom of voting for liberals in the closet living in small conservative villages because the priest simply can say do not go to vote and everybody will see if you go). 

&gt;Our constitution is total crap. You can just change with stupid Volksinitiativen.


oh yeah, let's set it in stone, it doesn't matter if after 50 years the people which make up the state don't feel it's what they want anymore.

But Italy is a democracy. They actually elected those politicians. That's the country that kept reelecting Berlusconi over and over again. Honestly, the Italians are the last country that I would think of when it comes to 'reasonable political decisions'. 

&gt; You don't know much about Italy and have never spoken to italian people and observed their politics in a continous way otherwise you'd agree that direct democracy would help them

yeah, you mean like the SVP doesn't feel like human rights anymore right now?! Or like the Germans more felt like Hitler before WW2? 'The feeling of the people' is exactly the problem. People get emotional and make stupid things all the time. Also it's not that a constitution has to be unchangeable, it should just be very hard to change and have certain unchangeable aspects (like you can't get rid of democracy).

&gt; fits that period of time, it has to change with the times

No, it doesn't have to change. I don't think you even understand what a constitution is. You are talking about laws. That's not the same, my friend...
