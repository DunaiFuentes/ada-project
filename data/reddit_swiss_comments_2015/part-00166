That heavily depends on where you are in Switzerland. Here in Lausanne, people *will* think you're mad if you start talking about guns outside of specific contexts. And if you start talking about less gun control being better, everybody will quickly think of an excuse to stop talking to you. :)

/r/Switzerland is full of anti-gun people (as you noticed because of the downvotes and some of the comments, our dear French Swiss are known to be the worst of them), so it's going to useless for you to search for someone that might help you over here. It would be better if you stick to /r/guns or /r/firearms.

Now, to shoot a gun in Switzerland is not really a problem. It's easy for you to contact a gun range and rent some guns. Most ranges cost around 30 Swiss Francs for half an hour, this is excluding the price of the gun and ammo. 

You have several ranges that will allow you to rent and shoot guns without being a gun owner:

&gt;http://www.bruenigindoor.ch/de/Angebote

&gt;http://www.selgis.ch/

Here's a map with some of the best shooting ranges in Switzerland that allow you to shoot most guns:

&gt;https://www.gunfactory.ch/images/schweiz_schiesskeller.jpg

Or a list with many of those shooting ranges with contact information:

&gt;https://www.gunfactory.ch/div/schiessk.htm

Personally I've visited many of those ranges, but the best ones are by far Brünig Indoor and Selgis if you want some real quality. The most laid back ranges (where the owners are not a pain in the ass when it comes to shooting) are certainly VIP Security in Bellach and Waffen Ingold in Höchstetten.

Now the problem with **official** shooting ranges (gun societies) is that they will only let you shoot with certain guns such as the SIG 550 and a couple of other pistols and they are extremely old fashioned and close minded, so if you go to one of those it will be a bad experience because it's full of old guys that see anything other than the SIG 550 or SIG 510 as crazy. The key here is to visit a **private gun range**.

Since you speak French, your best bet would be Armurerie Lagardere in La Chaux De Fonds:

They have a **huge** variety of guns and you can rent guns and shoot them without a problem. Just remember to take your ID with you and have fun!

The Swiss system actually is rather unique that you pay a fixed price going from A to B (maybe it depends a bit on which route you take, but usually it doesn't), while in many other systems it also matters what kind of train you take and at what time you take it. See ICE Zuschlag in Germany or the extra fee for different Shinkansen trains in Japan.

I don't know about you guys, but here in Switzerland I can just sit in any train that has written Zürich HB on it somewhere as long as I have a ticket for Zürich, but in Japan I have to check if it's the right train first. Maybe I can only sit in a Hikari train, but not in a Nozomi train.

Also we have the concepts of zones here. As long as I stay in the urban zone of Zürich, I need a Zone10 ticket and that's it, I can go anywhere. Same goes for all the other cities and even rural areas work like this.  
In Japan every single metro station has a different price. I have to count if I go 3, 4 or maybe 5 stops until I reach my goal and have to choose the price of my ticket accordingly. Same in rural areas with buses.

Granted, the Japanese system is very convenient as well. Trains are always on time and they always stop exactly at their designated line. The doors always open at the same spot.  
I can literally stand exactly on the spot on the platform where the doors of the car with my reserved seat will be when the train arrives. In Switzerland there is always a little bit of a search involved when it comes to reserved seats and people are spread all over the platform and cluster around the doors, while in Japan everybody stands in a perfect line in front of the doors.",null,0,null,1430672996,null,0,false,0,cqx25ah,null,t3_34q429,null,t1_cqx25ah,null,t3_34q429,null,null,null,1432748049,null,21,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,21,null

Could you give an example? Never had a bad experience with them. Put money in, press one button, take your ticket and leave. Maybe you mean finding the price was difficult? That's what was largely solved by the prepaid cards. And no these aren't equivalent to 'Mehrfahrtenkarte' - you can use them on any bus, train and metro except Shinkansen, for any route you want to take. I.e. I never have to care about ticketing at all where ever I want to go - just keep the card charged and scan it at entry &amp; exit (impossible to forget since there's a barrier).

From what I know though, GSMD have a double coat since they are meant for the cold weather. So shedding will obviously be prevalent.

**Copied from a GSMD website:**

 *Yes. Although shorthaired, Swissies have a thick ‘double’ coat. Most Swissies will shed heavily in the spring when they lose their thick undercoat. Regular brushing and occasional bathing will help to reduce the amount of hair shed throughout the year, but some shedding will still occur.*

**And another one:**

*Swissys shed an average amount. A good weekly brushing will do the trick.*
