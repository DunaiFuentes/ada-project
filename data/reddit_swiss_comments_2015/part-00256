CH used to be more ""local"" but this is obviously lessening. I'm not sure about the future. right now, the situation is peaceful, the country is prosper, not much neighbor hate (haters will rather direct it at other groups). as a reminder, 19th-century CH had a civil war between catholics/conservatives and reformed/progressives (not between language groups!). my grandparents (born ~1930) would find it ""funnier"" if I married a catholic than a Swiss-German.

the way I see it, the fact that the majority has German as official language also helps:

* it's also foreign to them (they speak dialects), I find Swiss-Germans linguistically very open
* post-WW2 German culture (which affects German-speaking CH) is rather chill, IMO

yet another thing I could mention: we do have tensions, but they're quite weak so far. as I wrote, I'm not sure about how it will evolve. making sure the population is taught national languages is important and not easy.
