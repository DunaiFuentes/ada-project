I arrived from Berlin on a Swiss flight (which was already delayed due to the horrendous weather over Switzerland, what a landing...) and the threat must have been called in just EXACTLY as we landed. The buses that dropped us off at the terminal obviously did't know, because they dropped us off and left us trapped.

Everything was shut down, lifts, escalators and exits (the glass one's into duty free before something to declare). It was pretty frightening because it was evident things had been left in a hurry, and they were not really organised for us. The entire group of people from our flight were split in two as we were half way through the gates when they shut. Pretty manic, although most did stay calm.
