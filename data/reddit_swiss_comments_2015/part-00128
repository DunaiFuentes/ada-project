I had for example already seen some of the math stuff in highschool that my swiss colleagues didn't so it was easier for me ;)

Chemistry and biology are different courses. Biochemistry is included in the biology course.

They changed a bit the biology course, so it's different now from how it was when I started. What I know so far is that you will start with a broad basis of biology (from plant to cell biology, neurology, biochemistry), maths, physic, and chemistry. I think in the second semester you can start choosing ""Wahlfächer"" from three different modules: 

1) biodiversity, 

2) cellular and molecular biology and 

3)biological chemistry. 

When you want to do biochemistry, I would choose lectures from the last two modules (especially organic chemistry!).

A useful link is www.vvz.ethz.ch . You can check out the lectures from previous semesters with a short description. I helped me a lot in my deciding to come here to ETH. 

Just a fair warning, as somebody else already mentionned, you won't have much of a summer in the first two years. Exams are always in August, and you first exams will only be after a full year (no exams after the first autumn semester) and, believe me, it will be A LOT!!

null,false,fffmmm,bl,Basel-Landschaft,null,"As far as I know, google doesn't pay Swisscom as of right now.

Maybe to start off: peering is the idea that two (or more) groups connect their networks somewhere to allow data-exchange between the two networks. This is made that for example a Swisscom user can communicate with a cablecom user instead of swisscom users only being able to communicate with no one but other swisscom users. This is quite literally a few cables that you plug from a router in one network to a router in another network. Peering is done without either party paying the other for the traffic that occurs: it's a ""your customers now have access to my network and mine have access to your network"" kind of deal. (Aside of peering, there's also transit, but that's irrelevant here).

Now as you can imagine, netflix, google and co send a lot more traffic in to the Swisscom network than the Swisscom network sends out to them (The packets requesting the movie from netflix/youtube/??? are a lot smaller and usually also fewer than the packets containing the movie). In addition to that, Swisscom has a lot of customers and wouldn't it be a pity if your video-platform (or whatever) was really slow for swisscom customers?

Swisscom isn't stupid and thus they went to init7 and basically said ""wouldn't it be a pity if you were to lose access to our network or if your access to our network would be really shitty? But hey, rejoice for you could just pay us money and we will in return we don't deny you peering access to our network"". Thereby Swisscom wouldn't only make their customers pay for what they request, but they'd also make those who serve those requests pay. They'd get paid twice, but only do the work once. Init7 wasn't entirely sure if they could even afford the exorbitant sums of money that Swisscom wanted and were not okay with Swisscom trying to pressure them to pay for something that's always been free for both parties. That's when init7 filed a complaint and later won in court. Since then Swisscom behaved as far as I know.

In the USA where there's more of a duopoly situation than in Switzerland, the big Providers have successfully pressured some content providers - like netflix - in to paying them money and they were not stopped by a court. They just let the interconnection between the network that is used by spotify and their network completely clog up at which point netflix' video quality massively degraded for customers of those ISPs and it had to buffer a lot. The ISPs could litterally have solved this problem by just plugging a few cabled from netflix' network to theirs - that would have only taken a few minutes and cost at most a one time fee of a few thousand dollars for hardware (level3 even offered to pay those few thousands for the hardware to these ISPs - at which point it would have literally been completely free for them). Yet they deliberately chose not to plug those additional cables - they wanted netflix to pay them money for the traffic and only after that $$$ arrived they'd plug some additional cables.

On a positive note: Swisscom didn't get away with it and aside of that I don't know of any questionable thing they tried to pull. Oh and their customer support is the best I have used so far (internet of a relative broke and I was asked if I could fix it) - the support staff knew what they were talking about and the problem was found pretty fast (router HW broke for some reason).

[Disclaimer: I neither employed, nor have I ever been employed by either side of this conflict (swisscom, init7). I am not even a customer of either, don't hold any stock nor do I have family working for either. I don't want my internet to be shitty and that's why I point it out when an ISP tries to get aways with something questionable.]",null,0,null,1428355061,null,0,1428355490,0,cq3dsss,null,t3_31mf1t,null,t1_cq3dsss,null,t1_cq398b1,null,null,null,1432233486,null,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2,null

Why would we do that? They are not the same, the purpose of a car is not to kill.

&gt; In many county areas, unincorporated land not within city limits, firearms are allowed to be used as long as they maintain the mandated safe distance (1/4 mile from any road or structure where I am from) from any road or structure and do not pose a threat to any nearby residents (meaning not being shot in the direction of anyone outside that safe distance). 

You're kind of missing the point. The original post showed how easy it is to buy guns. Then some responded that this is 'kind of creepy' and OP then asked why. This wasn't about 'what's the best gun regulation?'. I don't think your proposed limits go far enough but I'm not really arguing that all guns should be banned. E.g. hunters or the police is totally okay. Just take the UK as an example. Access to guns is very limited and it works very well. It's fairly absurd to believe that adding guns to the UK would lead to any improvements (and the overwhelming majority in the UK would agree with that). 

&gt; Firearms enthusiasts, similar to motorists, are required to be safe with the operation of their firearms, especially when the population density is much higher.

Again, firearms are just there to harm, car aren't. The argument 'it's fun' doesn't really count if you also create a potential threat to others. I think it's fun to shoot guns, it would also be fun to throw hand grenades in a city center or drive around in a tank. But such things are simply not acceptable because you can't just do stuff just because it's fun when others might get hurt. There's absolutely no need to shoot guns. It's just a hobby and you have no right for such a hobby, just like you have no right drive tank through a city center while throwing grenades (obviously that doesn't apply for the wacky Americans that would write such nonsense in their constitution).

&gt; banning the outright ownership of them does little to change the effects of those that use them irresponsibly or unlawfully

The point is, is that even though you can regulate something to death, people are still going to do it, or in the case of guns, obtain them.

However, with that, you've circled back around to your first counter argument:

&gt;Why would we do that? They are not the same, the purpose of a car is not to kill

The purpose of a penis isn't to rape, but you are now okay with comparing rape to firearm homicide. Similar to comparing vehicular homicide (i.e. drunk driving) to firearm homicide, which you previously said should not be done because the two are not equal. Logically, if cars =/= guns because of their designed purpose and the comparison could not be made, why is penis = guns okay?

Furthermore, my post was to compare, logically, firearms to cars in terms of *regulation.* Your original post contained some misconceptions about the regulation of cars, and given the context of the post and the argument, I wanted to illustrate that firearms often have misconceptions regarding their regulation and usage.

Finally, in regards to the rape analogy, the laws preventing rape are in place to safeguard the populace. Law-abiding (read ""not crazy"") members of society are not effected by these laws as they would never dream of harming someone. Once again, similarly to firearms owners, the same is true, in that the majority of law-abiding firearms owners would never dream of harming anyone either, they just enjoy their hobby.",null,0,null,1428359528,null,0,false,0,cq3go5k,null,t3_30oppe,null,t1_cq3go5k,null,t1_cq3fxae,null,null,null,1432234840,null,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2,null

Are you serious?! The car is an example for something that can kill people too but it's not the same as a gun because it's primary purpose is not to harm people.

Rape was an example for a crime that is committed despite being banned but most people agree that it still should be banned. You seem to struggle to understand that outlawing something means reducing it and usually not totally making it go away.

&gt; firearms to cars in terms of regulation.

Well, just like cars, I think firearms should be regulated. But I think guns should be regulated much striker as they serve no useful purpose in private hands, which is not true for cars and therefore they shouldn't be regulated as heavily. However, I'm not very much in favor of cars either, so I'm not sure why you keep bringing this up, it was just an example...

&gt; they just enjoy their hobby

Well, search another hobby then?! There's absolutely no need to shoot guns and it creates all kind of problems that come along with it. Sure, most people are responsible but some aren't and you can't really tell the difference. E.g. people develop psychological problems years after they bought a gun. So you necessarily end up with crazy people owning guns just because some people thought it would be fun to play a bit with tools that were designed to kill people.

Some people will be in favor because they feel they are unnecessary, dangerous, and have no other purpose but to go fast, this of course makes them more dangerous. You don't *need* anything outside of public transportation, but if you really want a car, it shouldn't be legally allowed to breach the speed limit. But the other side says Yeah there are risks, yeah they might be pointless, but they enjoy them, enjoy racing them, enjoy collecting them, enjoy them as a hobby and feel these reasons outweigh the risk of irresponsible people. There is no right or wrong answer in this situation, and in the situation with guns. No matter what, there are people who will hold their opinion. You've made your case, I've made mine. Niether of us are satisfied with each other's answer, so we move on. I just don't care.
