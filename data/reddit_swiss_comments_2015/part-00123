my thoughts: underfloor heating is common. I've heard ceiling cooling is common in warmer regions of the World. does your product constitute an improvement compared to common ceiling cooling methods?

is it interesting to achieve both cooling AND heating from the ceiling? why? how is the heat transfer typically with such a setup? how much is radiant, how much is convective? is it so that ventilation must assist convection (is that hard to make it work)?
