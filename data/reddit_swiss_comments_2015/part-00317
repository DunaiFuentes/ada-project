null,null,Urgullibl,null,null,null,"Lists are what gets people elected. Seats are assigned to a party based on how many votes their lists get. Who exactly then gets to sit in those seats is determined by who from that list got the most votes.

Say you vote for your JUSO guy, but he doesn't get elected. That means your vote goes to JUSO and (because they have a ""Listenverbindung"") ultimately to the Socialists, where it contributes to them getting seats, even though you may not have voted for the candidates who end up getting the seats.

If you use one of the pre-printed lists, your list votes will go to that party and/or to whatever ""Listenverbindung"" that party is a member of. If you use the write-in form, you can state your favorite list on top, and any unused spots will automatically go to that list, while any write-in candidates will also give their respective lists a vote. If you do not specify your favorite list and leave empty spots, those votes are lost.

**TL;DR**: List votes are usually more important than votes for individual candidates. Vote for the list you most agree with rather than the candidates you most agree with, as the latter has a higher chance of helping people get elected whom you disagree with. If you dislike a particular candidate from your list, you can always just strike them out.

**Edit**: Reading through this, it sounds a little complicated. I'll give an example.

* There are 10 seats available. Lists A, B, C, and D compete for those seats. 
* List A gets 50 votes, List B gets 20 votes, List C gets 20 votes, and List D gets 10 votes.
* Therefore, List A gets 5 seats, List B gets 2 seats, List C gets 2 seats, and List D gets 1 seat.
* Those seats are assigned to the top 5 candidates of List A, the top 2 candidates of List B, the top 2 candidates of List C, and the top candidate of List D based on the number of votes each candidate got.
* ~~Now imagine that Lists C and D have a ""Listenverbindung"". Therefore, their List votes are pooled and they get 3 seats altogether.~~
* ~~Then imagine that List D has two very popular candidates, while List C has many different not-so-popular candidates.~~
* ~~This means that List D now ends up getting 2 seats, while List C only gets one seat despite having double the List votes of List D.~~

Confused yet?

Edit: Disregard the struck out part, it isn't correct.

The advice above is different from my experience, so I'll explain the process as it pertains to Geneva.

You need:

* Recent eye exam: 20 CHF at most Optometrists.

* **[Very Important]** Valid U.S driver's license that is at least 3 years old. Otherwise the DMV will not accept it and will categorize you as a ""recent/inexperienced driver"" and will require you to take the Swiss Driving exam once more. Apparently, the U.S is one of the few license's that don't specify how long you've been driving on the license, instead it merely states the date it was renewed/expired.

I made the ""mistake"" of renewing my US driver's license before moving here and encountered this problem. Was told I would have to provide proof that I've been driving longer than 3 years by having to submit a certificate that I passed the driving exam in the U.S (which for me would be 10+ years ago). Luckily, I was able to find an old driver's licence and they reluctantly approved that.

So make sure you have this squared off. 

* 150 CHF

* 1 Passport Sized Photo

* Your Swiss ID (Visa/CDL) and Passport

You get your US driver's license back, and your Swiss license the same day (not by post as mentioned above).

Neat note: Swiss driver's license's don't expire.

In allocating seats, all candidates votes and list votes are accumulated. So, in reality, candidate votes are a tool to influence who gets the most votes on each list. Strategically, you could, if you want a given party and a given candidate, vote for that candidate twice (""kumulieren"" is allowed, but only two votes per candidate) and leave all other lines empty.

null,null,as-well,be,Bern,null,"You got the Listenverbindung dead wrong. Here is how they work: rarely does a seat allocation go as smooth as you describe it. 
If there are two seats, say, party A has 20 votes, party B has 25 votes, party C has 26 votes and party D has 19 votes. 

Normally here, B and C would get a seat. If A and D have a Listenverbindung, seats are allocated to them as a block. That means that in the distribution, A/D have 39 votes, B 25 and C 26.

A/D get one seat, and C does get one, too. The seat of A/D goes to the stronger list, here A. 

Without the Listenverbindung, the seats would have gone to B and C, not A. That is how that works.

(Furthermore, in cantons with more than two seats, due to the allocation system, some seats are not immediately gained by a party having enough votes (read the Wikipedia entry to Hagenbach-Bischoff for more on that).

10 seats to be filled.

List A: 10 candidates, each gets 10 votes: 100 votes  
List B: 2 candidates, each gets 20 votes: 40 votes  
List C: 10 candidates, each gets 36 votes: 360 votes

List A and B are combined, List C stands alone.

Now let's apply the [Federal Act on Political Rights](https://www.admin.ch/opc/fr/classified-compilation/19760323/index.html) (link in French because the English version has informational, but not legal, value).

Start by applying Art. 40.  
Part 1: we divide 500 (total votes) by 11 (seats + 1) and round up to get 46, the allocation number.  
Part 2: we attribute to each combined or single list (as per Art. 42.1) the rounded-down division of its number of votes by the allocation number. Thus AB gets 3 seats and C gets 7.

All seats have been filled, thus Art. 41 does not apply.

Then we apply Art. 42.2, which tells us to restart the process for List AB.

Let's apply Art. 40. 
Part 1: we divide 140 (total votes) by 4 (seats + 1) to get 35, the allocation number.  
Part 2: we attribute to each list the rounded-down division of its number of votes by the allocation number. Thus A gets 2 seats and B gets 1.

All seats have been filled, thus Art. 41 does not apply.

Final results: A gets 2 seats, B gets 1, and C gets 7.  
Despite having candidates that are individually more popular than A's candidates, B only gets 1 of the 3 seats they share.

Parties can also combine sub-lists, i.e. have a list within a combined list within a combined list, a.k.a. *Unterlistenverbinding*. This is one of the only instances I'm aware of where the law *requires* discrimination based on sex, political opinions, region or age (Art. 31.1bis).
