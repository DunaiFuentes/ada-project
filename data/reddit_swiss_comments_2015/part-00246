But honestly, at least they'd be reasons. Stupid reasons, but you're only argument seems to be tradition... which is not an argument at all, because there is no intrinsic value in a tradition in the first place... other than giving you some comfort I guess.

I agree that same sex marriage is a major change in marriage history. But the incredible part is, that it does *not change* traditional man/woman marriage the least bit. It does not affect the existing marriages, they will feel absolutely no difference when homosexuals can marry too. All the other minor changes affected them. This one does not.

There are already different kind of marriages: Many weddings are not being held in churches because people are not religious. Nobody cares about that either. What matters are the rights the government awards to people who want to get legally married.   
Historically polygamy was totally fine for some time, there were things like dowries, certain rules about which family pays which part of the wedding costs (still exists in some Asian countries), parents were choosing the partner for their son or daughter (still do in India), sometimes people just got married for political or financial reasons.  
The concept of being married for love is rather new, before it was just luck if the couple actually liked each other. And because love is universal and not bound to gender, same sex marriage is just the continuation of fusing our egalitarian and libertarian values our country is built on with that of marriage.

Anyway so because everything stays the same for heterosexual couples you could also call it a **major change that does not a change anything at all**. It doesn't kill traditional marriage, because couples who are married and want to get married can get married. It would just not matter what gender they have.",null,0,null,1435561132,null,0,false,0,csm6cok,null,t3_3bakq9,null,t1_csm6cok,null,t1_cslfnyo,null,null,null,1437431831,null,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2,null
