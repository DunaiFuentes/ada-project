There used to be two base tracks for the bio curriculum, chemistry track and bio track, where the chemistry track had harder math, more chemistry including physical chemistry etc, and no botany/zoology. But apparently that doesn't exist anymore. 

From what I see now the bio curriculum is more or less what the old ""bio track"" was - you have math, physical chemistry etc. with the pharmacists and HEST people. It's still math but I would say it's probably the easiest math course at ETH, and remember you will have math at any other university too anyways...
