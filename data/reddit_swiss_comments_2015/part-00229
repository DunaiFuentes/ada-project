null,false,argh523,null,null,null,"&gt; It also seems to me as if people are a lot sloppier and **less precise** when writing in dialect.

Written swiss german is *too* percise. That's the problem. Everyone is writing down dialect-specifics, so you have to mentally switch to a different dialect when reading.

A standard written form would have to do the opposite. Be as dialect-netural as possible, and maybe put some makers down to indicate different readings.

For example, the L-vocalisation in many western dialects: alli vs. aui -&gt; ałłi. Vogeł, Bałł, Vokał, etc. While we're at it, maybe mark the nd -&gt; ŋ soundchange: anđers, binđe, etc.

Then for other things you have to go back to the middle-high-german (middle as in time, and high is an geography, eg. the south). The system of vokals doesn't adopt the changes in monophthongs and diphthongs of the central-german-based standard language (Ziit -&gt; Zeit, lieb -&gt; liib). We learn about some diphthongs in school, for example how ""ei"" and ""ai"" are actually pronounced ""äi"" in standard german (Stein, Kaiser). You could actually keep these, and just teach how they are pronounced in a specific dialect (so people from the east don't write ""Stai, Kaiser"", and people from the west don't write ""Stei, Keiser""). Or you could create a new one, like ""Stëi, Këiser"". You could do the same thing for others, redefining the pronunciation or creating new ones, for example ""Boum, Böum"" would be pronouced ""Baum, Böim"" in the east, ""Boum, Böim"" in the west. Consequently nöu, boue, etc. which in some dialects would be pronouced ""nüü, buue"". Because soundchanges are consistent, tracking the origins, the phonology, rather than trying to write the sounds (phonetics), you could create a system that can be read in a certain dialect consistently. Or you know, close enough.

It would look weird and wrong, but only if you didn't grew up with it. It becomes harder to write than just writing down the sounds, but learning how to spell everything is exactly what we're already doing with standard german anyway.  That things aren't actually pronunced like they are written is common in standard german too (and english, lol), but we just forget about it the more we get used to writing and reading it.

The biggest challenge, but also the biggest advantage of a written standard swiss german, would be syntax. For that, you'd need to define how particles and pronouns are written (and always write them fully if not contracted, der das dir däm etc), throw away the glue-n's and embrace the contraction maddness.

For example, you could allow these possiblities (how they might we written today in parenthesis):

&gt; I ha's dir gseit  (I has dr gseit / Ich hanns dir gseit)  
I ha'dr's gseit (I ha drs gseit / Ich hann dirs gseit)  
Är miech's iim (är miechs ihm / är miechs em)  
Är miech'm's  (är miech ems)  
hängt a'm'e Boum (amne Boum, amene Boum, am e Baum)

But never:

&gt; I ha's dr gseit  
I ha dir's gseit  
Är miech's m  
Är miech iim's   
hängt am e Boum

Much of the differences between dialects is how those contractions sound, but they usually work in the same way. If you write them down the way they sound, with the rythem of the specific dialect, they start to look very very different. But the difference is usually *if* a specific contraction is made, not how it is made. You could still allow those differences in wheter or not a contraction is written, but when they are written, it should be in a way that at least doesn't *conflict* so much with the other dialects.
