Bendahan's SHSs are really easy I mean very very easy but really not that interesting, it lacks structure and you'll have most of the lecture cancelled ( that's what happened for both of his course I took. ). So if you just want to get the credits with the least effort, it's the way to go.

Otherwise I'd recommand Glassey's SHSs he's an interesting speaker, you don't need to take notes, the topics are interesting (he has a lot of good anecdotes about each of them) and you just have to write a two page dissertation in the end with open book (laptop and internet included).",null,0,null,1437219132,null,0,false,0,ct7lh7f,null,t3_3dpy8j,null,t1_ct7lh7f,null,t3_3dpy8j,null,null,null,1437964468,null,2,false,EPFL,t5_2svyx,2,null
