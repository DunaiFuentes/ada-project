The population is also getting a lot more spread out. Basel Stadt's population is currently around the same level it was in the 1940s. It reached its peek in the 1970s at 213,000 and is now around 167,000 ([source](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel)). Obviously this is because people are moving to Baselland. Sprawl is an issue no matter what the population is. But, this is not necessarily caused by immigration.

People under 30 years old around the world want to live in urban centers. Switzerland has astoundingly low new residential inventory in its city centers, though.

Again using Basel Stadt as an example since it encompasses just the city center, typically around 200 new residences are built in Basel Stadt per year. Some years more are demolished than built ([source](http://www.statistik-bs.ch/thema/umwelt/wohnungsbau)).
