On this website you find all the activities, planned on August 1st.

Gurten is always a good spot. If you lie on the floor you can watch the fireworks from below. the downside of this is that after the fireworks, usually everybody rushes to the cablecare to get down of the Gurten. And sometimes you also wait maybe 30 minutes to get on the cablecar.

Other points are Münsterplattform, Monbijoubrücke, Nydeggbrücke, Aargauerstalden, Rosengarten, Bundeshausterrasse and Elfenau.

From there, you could walk back to Thun, if you like hiking.

Another nice thing to do (although it's a little further away), is the ""Lac de Tanay"". I was recently there, here you find some impressions: https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/3eq3pv/lac_de_tanay_switzerland_more_pictures_in/. There is a post van from the train station of Vouvry to Miex le Flon. From there, it's a one hour hike to the beautiful lake.
