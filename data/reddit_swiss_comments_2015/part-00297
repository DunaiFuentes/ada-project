What I'm talking about is a test against the general case of spin, not an arbitrary subset of all possible spin models.

The multi-channel, multi-experiment bump at 2TeV has people talking about the left-right symmetric models which may give reason to study some of the stranger parity options.  In fact, it looks like they didn't compare to any model of spin-1.

Other than that the couple trips I made to sweden didn't force me to ""adapt"" or anything.

As far as places go: the city I really recommend is Lucerne.(German Part) It's just the most beautiful city in switzerland imo.

(I'm from zurich, just to get this out of the way haha) Other cities I'd recommend are: Bern (Capital and very nice old town), Zurich (nice for shopping &amp; and quite a nice old town, but got a little too touristic recently), Geneva (nice for shopping)

Other than that I would also recommend you to go to Ticino (Italian Part) via the San Bernadino Pass (just a very beautiful ride in general) with the destination being the Lago Maggiore. Just very beautiful down there. 

Another very beautiful area is around Lac Leman/Lake Geneva (French Part) and from there to Wallis (the Matterhorn is in that area). Beautiful scenery and there are some nice hotsprings. 

These are my favourite parts but getting to all of them would include alot of driving... on the other hand, you'll see 3 pretty different cultures that are all equally beautiful. 

Anyways, if you plan to drive around I'd recommend you checking out the distances on the map.

We have a new party that suggest the creation of a new ""country"" with the northern regions of Italy (Lombardia, Piemonte, ...) with Ticino on the bases that Language and culture are shared.

They are a minority and they will remain like that.

Most of Tessiner not look kindly at Italy. The bigger problem are the 60'000 (and counting) peoples that cross the boarder every day to come in Ticino to work.
That has led to a decrease of the salary in pretty much all of the work sectors. And that make a lot of us Ticinesi not thinking good of Italy.
