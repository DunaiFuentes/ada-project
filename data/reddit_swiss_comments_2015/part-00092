Du antar rätt. Jag är inte helt säker men jag tror att det fungerar så här: Du pluggar till Bachelor med idealvis två ämnen som kan läras i gymnasiet. T.e. Tyska och engelska. Sedan ska du fortsätta med en Master i en av dina Bachelorinriktningar och samtidig börja lärarutbildningen. Du kan förstås också göra en normal Master först och sedan lärarutbildingen men om du redan vet vad du vill jobba med vore det lite dumt. [Jag hittade denna sidan som har lite fler detaljer.](http://www.berufsberatung.ch/dyn/1326.aspx?id=3107)

Man tjänar riktig bra som gymnasielärare, AFAIK. Men jag måste säga att jag skulle rekommendera att studera i Sverige om jag var du, jag vet att det finna många finansiella fördelar. Men jag vet inte om man kan bara jobba med en utländsk diplom här eller inte men jag antar att det går inom Europa. Ganska många tyskar jobbar här i denna yrken iaf, därför tror jag att det är definitiv möjligt.

Om du vill bara tjäna lite pengar efter gymnasiet är det säkert en möjlighet att komma hit, men det vore bra om du hade nånstans att stanna i början.

null,false,swizzero,null,null,null,"1. I would say this is the hardest part. Sure, there are a lot of international companies, that will welcome your english skills. But you would need some good german, french or italian for meetings and communication in the company.  
2. Maybe look out for ""home-office"" jobs, so you could try to work even if you aren't in the company by yourself for the beginning.  
3. This is really hard to answer, because as everywhere there are different opinions. Some people always think ""don't let foreigner work in our country, they will take our jobs."", and other that will say: ""We need foreigners, there are a lot of jobs we don't have menpower for.""  
Just search for ""job schweiz"" if you want to find something. There are a lot of different job-sites. Most companies use them, and some use local papers. But if you mostly speak english, i would recommend the internet. We also have an increasing interest in digital-applications, so you can try it often with an E-Mail.  
Be sure you send [enough informations](https://www.manpower.ch/en/candidates/advice/the-application/) with your CV  
4. It is, but you should consider that your SO isn't getting any provision by herself. And you still need a health insurance and so on...  
5. Rents rely heavily on the location you will live. Roughly you can say: ""As bigger the town/city is, as more you would have to pay, and as more you can expect to earn"". If you don't have any experience in working (and earning) already as a programmer you should not expect very much. I'm not a programmer myself, ~~but i would estimate about CHF 3500.- or 4000.-~~ *lclc_ mentioned it should be at least 4500.- CHF per month.* if you have an apprenticeship in a similare or exactly the profession you apply for.  
  
I would say it isn't easy, but still possible. Don't give up after a few applications. Logically a lot of companies will prefer someone that already lives here and speaks more fluent german.  
I wish you the best luck, i'm very open minded and would say we need different people in our country, it's never a good thing to only have kind of person/opinion.

I was ""found"" in Linkedin. I wasn't really looking for a job yet. I wanted to adapt and learn some German first, but then I got afraid of passing that and not finding something soon. I'm happy with my choice.

Regarding the swiss-german greeting ""Grüezi"" (or ""Grüessech"" depending on dialect); a lot of people ""swallow"" the first part of it and all you hear is ""..zi"" or ""..sech"", so that counts as the same in case you encounter that... ;P

Since you wrote a good part about the public transport, might want to reference the link to sbb.ch, since you can use that site to plan for all public transports.

But if you want to be alone mostly, then I HIGHLY recommend camping/hiking around La Dole in Vaud.

This is on the Jura mountains. When you get to this small chalet/restaurant it is completely surrounded by wilderness (forests, creeks and such, and a great view of Lake Geneva), and you can climb to that ball on the mountain in about 40 minutes, and 20 minutes back down. I've camped there many times and it's beautiful especially when you walk through those cow fields and through the forest. Find a clearing and pitch a tent. Just be aware of boars.
