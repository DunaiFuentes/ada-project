null,false,mikkelhoegh,zg,Zug,null,"I don't know what you're comparing to, but it doesn't strike me as that different from Denmark, where I grew up.

Basically, any road in countries with really cold winter weather will need serious maintenance frequently. Cars driving on the road causes tiny cracks in the asphalt, and water seems into them, and as you might know, water expands when freezing, which causes the cracks to become deeper and wider. This leads to potholes and other problems.

Additionally, lots of traffic, especially heavy traffic like trucks cause a lot of wear as well. 

A modern road is composed of several layers of asphalt (which is usually a mix of bitumen and stone chips/gravel of varying sizes). Topmost is a layer with fine stones, which handles wear from tires (that is, friction damage) better, since the chunks that inevitably gets torn off are smaller. However, this layer handles weight poorly, since it is easily deformed, so it's usually only a few centimetres thick. Below is one or more layers of bigger-grained asphalt, which handles the weight better. However, this layer handles friction really poorly, and is unpleasant to drive on.

So road engineers try to find a balance between having the top layer be thick enough to not wear out too quickly, but also not so thick that it deforms too much - you see this on old roads, where the there's two clear depressions in the road surface where the wheels of cars usually are.

There are different strategies to tackle this, but it basically breaks down to a three-way tug between road quality (ie. smooth surface, low-noise roads), maintenance frequency and costs.
