Sample bias?

&gt; with 3 percent, they should receive tons of calls and lot of offers.... 

not necessarily: if you're over 50 you're basically fucked because they'd rather employ someone younger from the Eu or so. Furthermore the unemployed don't necessarily have the skills that the jobs that are open require.

Also: that 3 percent is slightly ""frisiert"" as far as I know, the real percentage is more like 4%.

&gt; I bet if i send 500 cv, I won't get any answer at all. 

Maybe you want to submit an anonymized copy of your CV here so that others can have a look at it.

&gt; anyway, people I know here in Switzerland have no job or lousy paid jobs. 

Me too. Look for a new one or try to negotiate salary.

I have only met like three people who ever actually have been out of a job and on the search. Two of them found a job almost immediately, even if it wasn't the one they were looking for, I admit. Both of them are Swiss.

The third one is from Africa and is learning German. He really has a problem finding a job even though his residency permit isn't a problem, since he's married to a Swiss lady. He's young, but his American education probably doesn't fit any criteria the employers are looking for.

So you see, personal experience and your own environment say almost nothing about national statistics of millions of people. The two of us probably know about 500 people each, and it's not a good sample (size) for the national average, because it's totally biased.

So the 3% do not include people that have given up all hope and are no longer looking for a job, the real number of people who probably could work is a bit higher.  
Sure some of them get invalid insurance, but the IV will pay for a second education if you can no longer work in your job.

I honestly don't know how exactly it works with the unemployment bureau, because I just don't know anybody who goes there regularly. I don't know if it's really hard to get registered there, but really, really doubt, that they make it extra hard for Swiss citizens.

Let's make it political, because you mentioned the vote in 2014. Introducing limited immigration quotas will do almost nothing for unemployed Swiss people. Sure you're limiting the pool of available workforce to Swiss people, but you're also hurting the economy by taking away the companies' choice to choose the best person for the job.

I don't think you're suggesting it was a rational decision to vote yes anyway. I think you're suggesting that being unemployed and seeing so many foreigners getting jobs causes anger and envy against them. But why not be angry at me and my friends who also have no trouble finding a job? The only difference is that I'm not a foreigner and thus it's okay that I got a job and never have to worry about my job security, right?  
You admit it's an emotional thing and I think I point out that the emotion is mislead towards foreigners.

So let's talk about actual solutions. You mention foreigners allow better exploitation of themselves. Shouldn't you then be for better worker rights? For a minimum wage? For the inclusion of all industries into the system with ""Generalverträge""? Help strengthen the unions and organized labor in general?  
Yet in the past years basically *all* votes who might have improved working conditions for all people working in Switzerland were rejected. By the same people who were so strongly in favor of limiting immigration. That doesn't make any sense to me.

For your unemployed buddies who are just a lost cause and for the people worrying about getting properly registered for unemployment insurance and all the other bureaucratic loopholes I can only suggest looking at ""[Bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen](http://bedingungslos.ch/)"". Of course it's another leftist idea, but it's again directed at a problem you point out.

And this is the frustration that I have on the political level. You point out a problem and the people who are affected vote exactly against their interest and keep complaining how horrible their situation is. Well, how about voting for things that actually help you?

We are both qualified, young and speak more than 4 languages. But having an accent will make many people think that you are stupid. 

My Swiss acquaintances and friends never have an issue getting a job in a month or two, never do any overtime, and are paid and treated well. My foreign friends however get worse jobs and go over lengthy periods of unemployment, receive 20-30% less salary, work their arses off, and are constantly bullied and harassed by their employers and colleagues. So as you can see, my anecdotal, subjective experience is something else.

But this is the norm anywhere you go, people will almost always prefer to work with their countrymen. 

In any case, consider that the unemployment rate only covers people who are receiving unemployment benefits.
