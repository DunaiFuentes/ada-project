well, that would be if I associated you with nazism, which I don't recall. you may be surprised, but when I wrote Oskar's name, I wasn't actually thinking about his right-wing nationalist aspect. only ""If you're saying ... what you are really saying is that you think the voters are stupid.

&gt; tax at 15%

That seems very low. As an employee you paid ~10% of your salary social taxes and then on top of that another 10% income tax at the end of the year. But with a 20+k income/month this increases to 25% income tax or so. However, if you work as a independent consultant, then you're basically a company. Depending on the company type you either have to pay profit taxes and then income taxes on dividends or with some company types you pay the same as explained above (you're an employee of your own firm). 

&gt; I would work through a Swiss Intermediary that he (the headhunter) would use for payroll and back office functions

I don't think this is unusual. Basically you won't be employed by the financial firm but work for them as some kind of consultant. But you have to be employed somewhere, that's why they use some entity/intermediary. 

&gt; workdays would be mon-fri, 09.00-17.30 

The Swiss aren't too crazy about working hours but that seems very low. Work usually starts at 8am and I think for CHF 1000/day they expect you to work longer than 17.30. 8 to 5 (including a 1 hour lunch break) are basically the standard lazy office clerk hours, not the top IT contractor hours...

&gt; Could they just terminate me after a few weeks

Possibly. Usually contractors are making a lot of money when there is high demand but they are also the first ones that have to leave because they aren't employees. It's kind of high risk, high reward. But ultimately it just depends on the contract. Basically if they buy one year of consultant service from your employer (the intermediary) then you're good. But maybe it's just an on-demand contract where they only have to pay when you come in and if they don't need you anymore then they won't ask you to come in and hence you won't get paid.

&gt; rental contract that costs ASS 

Well, there are short term contracts too that have shorter notice periods. However, they are usually more expensive.

&gt; 1500-3500CHF a month to rent a flat 

Sounds about right, especially for Zurich and Geneva

&gt; I have a first phone/skype interview tomorrow, but I guess if they are interested they would like to meet in person.

You will find out soon enough. If this is serious and for a financial firm it's indeed very likely that they will want to meet you. I mean try to view it from their perspective: you could be a fraud too.

As long as you don't have to pay anything, you don't really have to lose anything anyway. Just don't pay any 'relocation fees' or any kind of fees to the recruiter or something stupid like that (no offense but that's how the fraud cases would work).",null,0,null,1428518938,null,0,1428520097,0,cq5mplf,null,t3_31vu1n,null,t1_cq5mplf,null,t3_31vu1n,null,null,null,1432273176,null,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3,null
