There was a ETH professor that lived in Switzerland his whole life, had a family here, paid taxes, no crime and he got rejected by some racist idiots from some countryside place. It was kind of a big story in the news a few month ago.

&gt; I won't let them because it's not convenient for me

That utter bullshit. You are implying that all politicians have some evil plan to destroy the country. There are a ton of countries that do fine without constantly voting on everything. The Swiss have proven that they can't handle the responsibility. It really doesn't matter what 'the people's will' is on a constant basis. Most people are stupid and change their minds all the time. The Masseneinwanderungsinitiative proves that very well. People want no immigration but they also want contract with the EU so that they can find jobs and be rich. Just that this isn't an option. The people voted for something that isn't available because they were too stupid to understand it. 

&gt; I don't want to accept the will of the people' and they people are screwed. 

That's complete bullshit too. I'm not saying we should be a dictatorship. I don't think you even understand how other democratic systems outside work. People can refuse to reelect politicians that screw up, they can change the majority in the parliaments and so on. Also there is a bit difference between voting on referendums on laws created by the parliament, which kind of makes sense, and the bullshit Volksinitiativen, which serve absolutely no purpose.

&gt; You don't need knowledge of economics to know that politicians getting huge wages or perpetual annuity even if they worked for just a few years is wrong.

Lol, in what kind of shitty job are you working?! Ever lawyer or banker makes much more than a Federal Council. You don't even have to be a CEO or so to make that kind of money. There are much better and easier ways to make a lot of money. That's just the SVP propaganda bullshit they feel to their uneducated voters (and btw. a lot of the SVP trash has actually much more money than councils too).

&gt; Again, it's not clear who protects the people from themselves since the people should have power over politicians like you said too.

You can do that in the constitution. A lot of countries have that. The German basically elected Hitler into power. So much about 'the people's will'. They can be very wrong. 

Our constitution is total crap. You can just change with stupid Volksinitiativen. If we ever have a big radical party they can destroy the whole country very easily.
