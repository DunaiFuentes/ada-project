Anywhere between Geneva and Lausanne is stunning
http://www.lavaux-unesco.ch/data/dataimages/upload/ambianceHome6.jpg 

But if you want to go to an ""off the beaten path"" area, then I HIGHLY recommend camping/hiking around La Dole in Vaud.
http://goo.gl/5UJH92
This is on the Jura mountains. When you get to this small chalet/restaurant it is completely surrounded by wilderness (forests, creeks and such, and a great view of Lake Geneva), and you can climb to that ball on the mountain in about 40 minutes, and 20 minutes back down. I've camped there many times and it's beautiful especially when you walk through those cow fields and through the forest. Find a clearing and pitch a tent. Just be aware of boars. I've never seen one but you'll definitely see the tracks they leave

Edit:St Cergue is beautiful too. St Cergue is amazing so you could just stay in that region and go in the plentiful forest. If you do go there, go to Rando Burger, best Burger in Switzerland imo. Also while you hike you'll probably randomly encounter a refuge to eat and drink so that's nice. Really the whole Jura mountain is beautiful because it's not high enough to be full of snow all year, instead you just have nature at its finest.

The Octavia is available as a sedan (""Limousine"" in German) or a station-wagon / estate (""Kombi"" in German). Both offer a lot of space (even the sedan), but if you want the maximum amount of space, then go with the Kombi.

It's available in a diesel or gas version and auto or manual version.

I did quite a bit of hiking as you described myself, but usually not existing routes out of guidebook. If hiking alone or in a small group, one can usually easily find a spot to camp. For larger groups I would advise to predefine the camping spots and get the permission from the land-owner or local authority. Most often I found it sufficient to knock on the next farm house and ask nicely if we could stay at some place by the woods or at the edge of a field for the night. Most of the time the answer was yes and sometime I also could buy some milk, vegetables, eggs etc. At the same time.

What do you need to do? Well plan your route and make some calculations as to how long it is going to take you to walk from point to point.

[XLS downloadlink German]

As for the camping this is usually the trickier part because you need the consent of the owners of the parcel you would like to camp on. This means that you need to actually go to the places you would like to stay at and ask at the next farm, who owns this particular piece of land.

They usually know who owns what if they do not own it themselves. If the parcel belongs to the village I suggest looking elsewhere because it is usually a pain in the ass to deal with administrations. Although Freedom to Roam exists on the national level, nowadays it is common to make camping require special permission. 

If the you have located the landowners you ask them if you could stay on their land for a night and then move on in the morning. Most people will be open for the idea, some will turn you down however due to bad past experiences. 

This is usually free of charge as long as you promise **TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELVES.**

If you do not clean up they will refuse to give it out to future campers which is particularity annoying for scouts and similar organisations. 

Just a few weeks ago we were turned away for a very nice camping site because some assholes could not clean up after themselves.

Cleaning up after yourselves of course means that you do not leave a single shred of litter behind you, which should be common courtesy. 

One problem I see with your idea is with the drinking and party part. In Switzerland we have night time from 10 after which neighbours can send the police to shut you up if you make a lot of noise. So if you want to party loud you will need the consent of all neighbours. I doubt that you will find a place in Switzerland where this is not a problem outside the Alps.
