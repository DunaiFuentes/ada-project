null,false,SwissBliss,vd,Vaud/Valais,null,"I'm from the french side of Switzerland. 

Ya there's really zero problem. I've lived here my whole life almost and have pretty much never had to use my German apart from with part of my family that lives near Zurich and Berne, but even then most of them speak good french and english so there was never really any problem.

Also there's no place in Switzerland, or the non English speaking world really, where you can be 99% fine with just English, as in Geneva and its surroundings. Most important things in Switzerland are in 2-5 languages.

In conclusion, I'm from the cantons of Vaud and Valais, both french speaking, yet part of my family is from the cantons of Berne and Aargau, and I speak french, english, and although I don't really have to use it I can communicate in German (and probably Italian from knowing french). If you come to Geneva or Romandie, you probably won't even hear a word of German in your daily life, and the region is so international that it just wouldn't work if everyone had to know several national languages. I went to an international school near Geneva, and tons of my friends literally can't speak a sentence of any national language (which is a bit shitty imo) but they're completely fine.

Edit: Also, the fact that the german speaking part of Switzerland use a ton of dialects makes it a lot harder for a french speaker to learn german, than the opposite. Most people on the french or italian side that speak german, learned it from school and it's high german.
