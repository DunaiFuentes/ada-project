Also, a firearms enthusiast lawyer JUST passed away.

As for exporting the gun from Switzerland I only know how it goes when you intend to buy one here. You have to prove you are eligible to buy a gun in your own country and the licensed firearms seller has to provide you with the necessary documents for that i.e. apply for them.

I can only provide you with some german links to our ""NRA"" so called ProTell. http://www.protell.ch/de/kontakt

They might be able to give you some help.

Also try to contact our federal chancellery here http://www.admin.ch/kontakt/index.html?lang=en

As for the firearm not being registered DO NOT tell federal authorities about that. That's none of their businness and in control of the canton. 

We just decided about that in 2014.

You absolutely have to register it with the canton he used to live in though!!! You're pretty much cool with that though, since it's not your fault it's not registered in the first place. The close friend it stays with might have to prove he's eligible to have it in his posession.

To be honest with you, your chances to ever hold that gun in your hands in the US are very slim.


Edit: Antique handguns have to be manufactured before 1870 and I believe handguns are excluded. (Just checked, they are. Regular firearm regardless of date of manufacture)

As for registering you have 6 months time to make yourself the legal owner of the firearm before you begin to slip into illegal territory.

Also: Isn't it generally forbidden to import guns from Switzerland to the US? That's the reason you don't have SIG 550s and all K31s get exported to Germany or some other country first and then to the US.

Edit 2: process is the same as with buying. You have to prove to the canton that you can own a gun in your country as your first step. Then they will provide you with a permit to export. You'll have to check importing to the US yourself.

You can find the official Swiss gun law here http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19983208/index.html

Once you have acquired your firearm you'll need to export it, this is regulated by the war material legislation and the cargo control legislation. Finally importing your handgun into the US will require an FFL and an ATF form 6 (methinks), so have fun with that.

Correct, 1/2 mv^2 is an approximation that's valid at low (i.e. non-relativistic) energies. The full relativistic equation is 
E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4

E= energy

p= momentum

You already know the limit where p = 0 - this is just E=mc^2. This is the rest-energy of an object - the energy it always intrinsically has.

You can show that 1/2 mv^2 emerges from the full equation, if you use p = gamma mv and take the Taylor series of the Lorentz factor. You end up with
