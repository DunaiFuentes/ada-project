Second question : Do you already have failed courses or can you pull everything up again if you work hard enough ?

If there is a chance to pass by working really hard, do it. For every credit you should work around 2 hours each week. Some can do with less but a lot of students need more to get good grades. During my studies I pulled quite good grades and spent 7am - 11pm during the week and a lot (the number depending on the projects and homeworks) during the week-ends.

If you take into account that french is not your mother tongue, you should add some hours to that. I don't know how well you speak it or what your mother tongue is but a lot of professors and their staff speak english (and usually a number of diverse languages from around the globe). Try to identify someone that speak the same language as you and go ask them a number of questions. They will quite probably help you (a number of them are also students from other years and want to help you - I was one of them and our team got out of our way to help students that worked hard.). It *would probably* also helps that they will know you as a hard worker when they will correct your exam.

Also, if you know a number of people in you classes, try to work with your classmates, it will be a lot easier to stay motivated and get explanations if you have questions. People always say that you have to work at the RLC but for me the RLC was the worse place to work. During my studies, we were a bunch of people working in some classrooms around the EPFL depending on the availability, discussing homeworks, throwing projects around when needed, ...

As for the administrative side of the things, there can be some things that could perhaps allow you to retake some exams. If you have medical certificates that explains that you skipped a lot of classes and could not succeed the exams, you can go to your studies advisor (look it up for your section, she/he is usually very nice and can pull off a large number of things for you if you are nice to them. They were able to swap courses/credits in my options group and mandatory courses so that the number of credits was ok and I did not have to spend one additional year for 6 credits).

Again on the administrative side, after the exams there is a discussion about students that are ""just under the passing grade"" to give what is missing if they think that they are ""worth it"", so to speak. Do not depend on this, but know that even if you fail one course because of some very bad grade you got in the first semester (some fluke can always happen) and did a superb grade at the end of the year, they *could* make you pass.

TLDR: Work really hard and some more, it is better than hoping to get a third chance.",null,0,null,1427354134,null,0,false,0,cpr5udc,null,t3_309c3o,null,t1_cpr5udc,null,t3_309c3o,null,null,null,1432021353,null,1,false,EPFL,t5_2svyx,1,null

MARCH 24, 2015 MICHAEL JANITCH	

CERN and the media came out this morning (last night) and are now saying that the “magnetic short circuit” happened on March 21st?

Odd that CERN made the post YESTERDAY on March 24th at 14:30 / 2:30pm CET (central European time).

The plane crash occurred around 12-1pm CET .. about 1-2 hours before this post from CERN:

So, now we see, 1-2 hours AFTER the crash , CERN came out and said the magnetic short circuit happened on the 21st?!

Why would they say they had a short on the 21st when they announced they were GOING AHEAD just two days ago on the 23rd?

Literally, they were supposed to begin powerup on the 23rd into 24th.  They said all was good and the media reports show it being reported as ready to go on the 23rd as well.

Someone is lying.

Original reports issued yesterday on Reuters say nothing about the 21st.

If it shorted out on the 21st, then they wouldn’t say all good on the 22nd + 23rd! As of 2 days ago, it was all go for a Wednesday (today) fire up.   This means that yesterday CERN was primed and ready.. then shorted out.

Here’s the report from 2 days ago.. march 23rd.. saying all was set to go.

“The particle accelerator, which will be restarted this week, has already found the Higgs boson – the God Particle – which is thought to give mass to other particles. ”

“The second run of the LHC will begin this week and the beams are expected to go full circle on Wednesday for the first time since the 27km accelerator was shut down in early 2013 for an upgrade. ”

“The first circulating beams of protons in the LHC are planned for the week beginning 23 March, and by late May to early June the LHC aims to be running at 13 TeV.”

It is even possible that gravity from our own universe may ‘leak’ into this parallel universe, scientists at the LHC say.

“Just as many parallel sheets of paper, which are two dimensional objects [breadth and length] can exist in a third dimension [height], parallel universes can also exist in higher dimensions,” added Dr Faizal,

“We predict that gravity can leak into extra dimensions, and if it does, then miniature black holes can be produced at the LHC.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has undergone important upgrades and repairs over the past two years since the first shutdown.

The particle collider boasts new magnets, superior cryogenics, higher voltage and higher energy beams that will allow the machine to run at nearly double the collision energy of the first run.”

It would appear CERN is now going to be on indefinite hold – due to a short circuit in one of the main magnets which controls the Hadron Collider.
