A big factor to the prosperity is innovation and just plain hard work. Switzerland is considered to be one of the most innovative countries in the world. So while you can't buy a Swiss car, for example, you will find parts made in Switzerland in almost any car.

Switzerland doesn't have any natural resources worth speaking of, but it does have a long list of successful companies, take a look at http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Swiss_companies_by_revenue and see how many you recognise.

Banking and financial services are another big thing for Switzerland, it alone is about 10% of GDP, but even without that, Switzerland would still be pretty well-off.
