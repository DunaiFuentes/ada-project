2) Probably similar, mostly it's to get used to the workload I guess.

3) I'm not sure. Again, epfl.ch might have the answers, or you can always ask the ""service académique""  at services.etudiants@epfl.ch
I think for CMS depending on the diploma you have, you either might not need any specific grade, or maybe just pass (4/6)... Not sure really.

4) I'm not sure about ME, but most section have a lot of classes in english, especially in the later years. CMS might be mostly french though. There will be no point knowing how to speak in french, as anybody who has any chance of getting a bachelor will be able to converse in english.

5) cannot say

6) No clue. Again, website / email

7) I guess you can walk around the campus, go to the bars / cafeterias, speak to random students / ask people on reddit to show you around. If you come on the right dates there'll be a ""Introductory conference"" where the president / faculty heads / student body will talk about the school, and then a welcome party which is just an excuse to get drunk for free and know a couple people when you come for classes a few days later.

8) Eeh... There's a few not-bad ones, mostly you'll end up paying for expensive warm beer to be surrounded by males listening to some random guy try to play music. Balelec's better, it's actually a proper festival (although it went through some major changes this year). Other closeby universities (medicine, HEC, law, EHL) have parties which are often more expensive but miles ahead relative to music/food/drinks/company/venue.

9) Do you mean in ME after you graduate ? Or a side job while studying ? EPFL studies are pretty demanding but many people manage to have a job on the side, although be prepared not to have too much free time.
If you have very good grades, you can become a TA, which pays 24CHF/hour. If you're lucky you might find a job on-campus such as cleaning labs or such, but they don't pay so much.

Asset split comes first, from that the inheritance is distributed.
