Saying no to fellow soldiers who asked me if I wanted to smoke was not a problem at all. Not even with those that had the job the least skilled recruits got (Betriebssoldat/Soldat d'exploitation) some of which were a little less intelligent and had somewhat crude manners.

In other words even those who were most likely to give you shit for your personal preferences as if it was still highschool didn't make any fuss about people not smoking.

But for the other reasons you named there were indeed people smoking who didn't usually. Two other big ones were snus and snuff, because you can hide snus and snuff is done quickly.
