Whoever paid for it, of course. May I add that apart from paying for the material, know-how and time to build the rod, you also paid for being able to fish and for the fish as you reeled it in. How exactly having to pay for those things once again simply because you died is in any way just is beyond any logic. It's taxing death, plain and simple.

I agree partially with your statement. The impact of the work (or the end) should also be a factor. I would not encourage the tobacco industry for example... Lot of work, great success, would not encourage it. At all.

Work should pay, that is how I was raised and I do like the notion. Now, I also do think that most rich people don't get richer because they work more than the others. Some might, but most of them don't. If we keep going on the statement, people who work more, should earn more. Since the richer just get richer, either they are working harder every year or the logic is failing to comply.

You say you should be able to use your money as you see fit... legally... but then, you accept the laws, who come from the government... like the taxes... So where should the government stop?

What about the fish, who owns the fish before I get it?

Taxing has no logic at all. There we agree. It's a tool, used to redistribute resources. I mean, there is no tax that makes sense. Why should I pay part of what I earn? Anytime? So logic on why you should tax succession has no importance here.
