However, there is no option to setup DHCPv6-PD via the GUI, but it can be done via the command line. And you need to configure everything yourself. So if you're not comfortable with that, go with the Microtic.

null,false,whitepalms85,null,null,null,"&gt; There is more to it, isn't there? Switzerland is rather successful by a lot of measures. We rate highest in many, many comparisons (education, quality of life etc.). Immigrant-wise people want to come to Switzerland rather than other countries in the neighborhood.

That's the same thing the Americans said before the financial crisis. Yes, Switzerland is successful but people have become arrogant and complacent. 

&gt; Specifically on the political system issue Swiss people rate relatively high when it comes to happiness with politics and their trust in politicians and the system as a whole.

The system is still shit though. People think it can't go wrong.

&gt; So.. the people are happy and we can see the many other results of our direct democracy.

I would rather say that the country is successful despite direct democracy. If there ever were a massive crisis in Switzerland our system would collapse VERY fast. A lot of the success of Switzerland was based on the fact that mainly the FDP was in charge and political parties weren't abusing the system. Now Volksinitiativen are purely used for populism, actually they never really served a purpose anyway and we should ban them. I don't mind if people vote on laws that went at least through parliament or on local stuff that is simple to understand and doesn't have a big impact (e.g. building a new football stadium or so). But Volksinitiativen are just pure trash, they create nothing but instability and the quality is terrible.

&gt; I think I agree that the people's vote is taken a bit too sacred. The majority can be wrong, yet ""Volkswille"" is shouted at anybody who is a sore loser after a vote. But that's more the narrative of the public discussion, rather than actual actions being taken.

I totally agree. One of the strengths of Switzerland is/was actually political stability and moderation. E.g. I think it's very good that we have a federal council (instead of a powerful president), that all bigger parties are represented and that the council members don't have to campaign for their seats. In other countries you have majority government / collisions and campaigns and politicians waste a ton of time and money on it. And if the opposition wins then they will waste even more time on reverting thing the previous government implemented. Honestly, I actually think the people on the federal council should be banned from being members or associated with any party. I want to have a council full of very smart and very well educated people, the best of the best, not stupid politicians and I wouldn't mind to pay each of them a multimillion salary, just to get them.
