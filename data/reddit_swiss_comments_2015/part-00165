I will presume that you are American so I can tell you this. Europe has good public transportation systems so you won't have trouble getting there, and if you need help there will be places where you can ask as long as you speak in a calm and slow English. I haven't lived in Lugano for a long time so I may not be the correct person to answer but here is what I came to:

&gt; And finally, is there a better route that we should consider?

Ill begins with this: I searched your route in Google maps and it looks like it is faster to take the bus on the east side if the valley. Then you don't have to ride the ferry. Link:  [Here](https://www.google.no/maps/dir/Lugano,+Switzerland/Bellagio,+Como,+Italy/@45.9834766,9.1178253,12z/data=!4m18!4m17!1m5!1m1!1s0x47842df76a4211f1:0xef8c04212ea1f8e0!2m2!1d8.9523121!2d46.0065117!1m5!1m1!1s0x478418083ef632d9:0xeb1911c1208de958!2m2!1d9.2588491!2d45.9782492!2m2!7e2!8j1433494800!3e3!5i1).

&gt; What bus station should we be going to once we get off the Wilhelm Tell Express?

Google maps says that both bus routes (Menaggio or bellagio) begin right next to the train station. Link: [Lugano - Bellagio](https://www.google.no/maps/dir/Lugano,+Switzerland/Bellagio,+Como,+Italy/@45.8076313,9.0749398,17z/data=!4m18!4m17!1m5!1m1!1s0x47842df76a4211f1:0xef8c04212ea1f8e0!2m2!1d8.9523121!2d46.0065117!1m5!1m1!1s0x478418083ef632d9:0xeb1911c1208de958!2m2!1d9.2588491!2d45.9782492!2m2!7e2!8j1433494800!3e3!5i1) or [Lugano - Menaggio](https://www.google.no/maps/dir/Lugano,+Switzerland/Menaggio+CO,+Italy/@45.8168376,9.083967,14z/data=!4m17!4m16!1m5!1m1!1s0x47842df76a4211f1:0xef8c04212ea1f8e0!2m2!1d8.9523121!2d46.0065117!1m5!1m1!1s0x47843d067e66a05f:0x829849a45fdf6c27!2m2!1d9.2388285!2d46.0217068!2m2!7e2!8j1433494800!3e3)

&gt; What bus should we be trying to get on to get to Menaggio?

Again google maps says the bus is called C30 to Bellagio and C10 to Menaggio.

&gt; How long is that bus ride?

Google maps says about an hour for both rides.

&gt; How far is the ferry stop from where the bus from Lugano will be dropping us off?

If you mean the bus from Como, it looks like it will be about 50 meters from the bus station to the ferry. Again, these are well thought government planned stops so it should not be far at all. 


I hope this info helps, slightly drunk now so I hope there aren't to many mistakes.

**Via Menaggio**

* Take the urban bus (Number 2) from Lugano station (right next to it) to Palazzo Studi. It runs four times in an hour, the trip will be about 10 Minutes.

* Walk (20 Meters or something - check out on Google maps) to Lugano Cassarate. Board the Bus Number C12. [It will leave at 17.22h](http://www.asfautolinee.it/Portals/5/Documents/Orari/I1213/lago/C%2012%20modificato.pdf) 

* The bus will reach Menaggio - Piazza Roma at 18.21h. Ask the driver if he takes a stop before that, so you can get out at Menaggio - Hotel Bellaviasta.

* There is a boat service that leaves Menaggio at 18.50h and arrives at 19.25h at Bellagio. (see the [timetable](http://www.navigazionelaghi.it/eng/c_orari.asp))

**Via Como**

Another way to reach Bellagio is to change trains at Lugano. 

* Take the train leaving Lugano at 16.34h (that's not a long time for you to change trains. So it's probably best to buy tickets in advance). You will reach Como at 17.12h ([timetable](http://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html))

* At the Como Station take the bus [C30 to Bellagio](http://www.asfautolinee.it/Portals/5/Documents/Orari/I1213/lago/30.pdf). It will reach your destination at 18.50h

In Belgium ranges are rare, gun ownership is very low, and most people never saw a weapon except in museums or in the hands of police.  

Everytime there is a tragedy that involves firearms, in both countries politicians try to make the laws a notch stricter, but in Belgium, they succeed all the time (there is no referendum system of any kind here).  

Gun-policy wise, the big problem about Belgium is that the country heads the way of the UK, as does the whole EU.  If I get a gun here and now, it is likely to get confiscated within a decade or two.
