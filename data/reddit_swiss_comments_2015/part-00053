Eucalyptus, sold as a natural decongestant does work by opening up airways. Ginger and Sage teas, the latter sold as class D medication, do also sooth stomach and digestive problems. Salt water mouth washes, kill bacteria and sea salt nose sprays can unblock your sinuses. 

Homeopathy is by its very definition none of the above, and generally not as advertised (although sometimes available) in pharmacies, although your health insurance may indeed subsidize homeopathic / natural treatments. 

That said, the way natural treatments are pushed in Switzerland makes me cringe, the fact that there are herbs and plants sold as ""medicine"" also makes me feel uncomfortable. Not just because of the high prices of throat soothing cough sweets but also because it breeds miss-information where even pharmacists will dangerously push natural stuff instead of suggesting the person visits a medical professional.

Since we're on the subject of pseudoscience... Organic agriculture is bullshit. 

It's defined as agriculture that only uses natural pesticides, with a fairly shady definition of ""natural"", e.g. copper sulfate is allowed.

There's exactly 0 reasons not to use pesticides developed in laboratories by people who know what they're doing and who have precise goals (maximize effectiveness against pests, reduce toxicity against non-pests). 

""Natural"" stuff in agriculture is just as good as ""natural"" stuff in medicine: some of it is useful, but limiting yourself to natural options when some synthetic alternatives are clearly better is ridiculous.

You have a disease? Take something that *causes* that disease, dilute it in water with dilutions like 1 in 10^30 (that's one with 30 zeroes behind), don't forget to shake it while you're diluting.  
Tada! Homeopathy.

For instance, if you can't sleep, dilute 1 part of coffee in 10^30 (or more) parts of water, and now you can sleep... according to homeopathy.

The most ridiculous example is the well-known and heavily-marketed Oscillococcinum, which is made from duck liver diluted in 10^200 (yes, you read that correctly) parts water.
