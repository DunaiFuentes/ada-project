WOKO is indeed the thing I was thinking of.  I don't know many details about it because I was not eligible (no longer a student) but what I have heard is that you can find some rooms to rent for much cheaper than elsewhere.  

Certainly, the credit card arrangement is sub-optimal, but it is convenient and avoids transferring a lot at once when the exchange rate is bad (unless of course it gets worse).  When I moved, I had to do a transfer from my US bank with the first month's rent as a deposit, and then I had to pay my second month in cash.  It's not ideal, but it worked fine for me.  But if you find a place for only a few months, you might be able to arrange your transfers ahead of time with your bank, and schedule them for each month.  But you'll have to talk to your bank about that.  

Also, if you're from Ottawa, I would guess that you have a decent chance of speaking French as well as English.  This will certainly help here, but more so in Romandie.  But I'd recommend a crash course in German if you don't already speak it.  You can make it just fine here with English alone, but especially if you'll be studying here for a while, it will definitely be worth it to invest in learning German.
