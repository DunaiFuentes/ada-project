If we had a majority vote, there would be exactly 5 parties in parliament. 

Based on this, I did a little math. Under a majority vote by canton, the National Council would have looked like this:

* Party: Seats (% of popular vote, % of seats)
* SVP/UDC: 122 (26.6%, 61%)
* SP/PS: 41 (18.7%, 20.5%)
* CVP/PDC: 20 (12.3%, 10%)
* FDP/PLR: 16 (15.1%, 8%)
* BDP/PBD: 1 (5.4%, 0.5%)

Whereas under proportional representation, it looked like this:

* Party: Seats (% of popular vote, % of seats)
* SVP/UDC: 53 (26.6%, 26.5%)
* SP/PS: 46 (18.7%, 23%)
* FDP/PLR: 30 (15.1%, 15%)
* CVP/PDC: 28 (12.3%, 14%)
* BDP/PBD: 9 (5.4%, 4.5%)

Plus parties that wouldn't have received seats under majority voting:

* Party: Seats (% of popular vote, % of seats)
* GPS/PES: 15 (8.4%, 7.5%)
* GLP/PVL: 12 (5.4%, 6%)
* EVP/PES: 2 (2%, 1%)
* Lega: 2 (0.8%, 1%)
* CSP/PSC: 1 (0.4%, 0.5%)
* MCG: 1 (0.4%, 0.5%)
