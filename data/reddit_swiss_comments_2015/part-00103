So. In R1, on the upper floor to the right when you go up the stairs, there are some comfy blocks (meant for kids, maybe) outside the auditorium that are ok for short naps if a bit small, but at least they are out of the way. Seminars in the smaller auditorium down the hall happen every day around 16:00 so not then.

My favorite place was outside of R2. There are some trees and grass just outside that are unfortunately in view of the main walkway, but the place shuts down at 2 so any time after that I'd go and lay in the shady grass here. 

If you are in building 6/8/10 the break room off the control room has a couch in the break room, but you need an access card. However this was only secluded because for the past year no one was in the control room...now that run 2 is starting I think it will be frequented more often. This is where I worked, so you might have to ask around your area.

Plan Z is go to the library, go downstairs, take a cubicle and put your head on the desk. It's really quiet and you'll look like an overworked PhD student and no one will bother you.
