As I said above, this is not true. People who do not get the stuff legally because they are not / no longer allowed to do so will still turn to the black market which will still be funded by smuggling and illegal production. 

&gt; the second is that the remaining addicts would have a safe, clean supply for their needs.

*as long as they have a valid perscription and are content with their dose / type of drug*. The problem with this model is that it usually assumes that the people who get one will use that, and only that, for their needs.

If you have a very restrictive prescription practice, there is some truth in it.  But your run of the mill heroin addict should be able to got to his practitioner and get a prescription for the drug.

As for the price, you'll have a base price for the good and legal stuff, the illegal stuff can not be much more expensive because people will use the legal stuff instead. Of course, if the government taxes it a lot, there may be a new market/opportunity to gain margin there, like we have it with cigarettes.

&gt; They forget about the people who do not get a prescription, which will be many (otherwise the whole model makes no sense) and that they will not just give up / not take drugs, but pursue the same channels they are already using to date.
Yes, there will be. But there already are.

My aim is not to prevent people from taking drugs, they'll find a way. My aim is to cut down on criminality, opportunity for mafia and war on drugs occupying our police forces.

The real test would be to see if such a policy increases the abuse of such substances or not. I'm sure it is mostly not. There are and will be people who abuse, lets give them a way to do that with the least negative impact on society.
