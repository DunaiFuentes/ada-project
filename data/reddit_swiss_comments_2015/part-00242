&gt; I also do openly transport my guns when I go to the range, but that's about it.

Just want to emphasize this. The law is that you are allowed to transport your gun from your home to the shooting range safely. You are not allowed to have a gun on you otherwise (not from-to the shooting range). The pictures you saw with a 21 year old on his bike with an assault rifle on his back is exactly this. He is a soldier driving from home to the shooting rage with the weapon he was lent by the army for his yearly mandatory precision shooting exercise. He does not carry ammunition, only an empty gun. Ammo is provided by the range for immediate local consumption.

The only people you see here carrying guns are police the the army. The army either exercising in the countryside or guarding an event, like the world economic forum or embassies an building during high profile international negotiations, like Kerry talking to Iran.

Wikipedia has an overview: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Switzerland#Transporting_guns

If carrying a gun is important to you, then you are much better off in the US in a state where this is allowed and part of the local lifestyle.

There are books but lets be honest, you're not going to learn a dialect/accent from a book (not efficiently anyway). Even more so because swiss german is tecnically a spoken  language and has no standardisation/ spelling rules. 

Talk to people, mingle, have them repeat stuff, ask them to speak slowly. Imersion is the best way to learn a language.

Edit: Focus on understanding, no one here really expects people with other mother tongues to speak swiss german.

Owning the guns won't be a problem as long as you have the right residence permit. Legally importing them involves a bit of paperwork; there have been other threads in this sub as to what exactly you need to do.

You won't get a CCP unless you can demonstrate a need to have one, and from what you write, you can't. Open or concealed carry is legal *on reasonable business* (i.e. going to the range, the gunsmith, a gun show etc.), but the gun must not have any ammunition in the magazine, so carrying a loaded gun in public is a no-no. You can't just carry a firearm around in public for no good reason.
