I know the vinyard terraces of lavaux are beautiful (been there) and there's the castle of Chilon nearby (been there), I've also read that Lausanne and Rochers de Naye are beautiful.

Moving away from lake geneva, there would be the caves of vallorbe (been there long ago), Creux-du-Van Val-de-Travers, the Subterranian Mills at Col-des-Roches, or historic wise the roman museum at aventicum, the city of Fribourg

The beatus caves, Lauterbrunnen valley, Jungfrau, Ballenberg museum, Aare gorge around Interlaken.

Mt. Stanserhorn, Mt. Rigi, Mt. Pilatus, the Rütli (founding place of Switzerland) near Lucerne.
