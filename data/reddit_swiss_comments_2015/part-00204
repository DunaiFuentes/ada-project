* Genetic testing: Makes sense, might save money in the long run
* Inheritance: Initiative purely based on jealousy. Typical left-wing stuff. Will hurt KMUs since the tax exempt amount is undefined which means they can set it as low as they want. + for private people 2mio is not a lot nowadays. I mean buy a house, pay back all credits and you will very likely have 2+ mio in weath. Also the statistics the initiators used are wrong for example that only 1% is affected is bs.
* Stipendien: Basically sets a minimum wage for students, regardless of background. + Creates new huge expenses + people who need a scholarship usually get one.
* SRG/Billag: Transforms the expense into a tax + basically guarantees that the price will rise since they can randomly define it.

PID: If you ask people ""do you want to genetically engineer children?"" the answer will most of the time be ""no"". So the question that is relevant in this discussion is ""where do you draw the line?"". Many people who will vote ""no"" do so to nip this in the bud ( ""Wehret den Anfängen"" ), similar to the ""Gentech-Moratorium"" which forbids any research or production concerning genetically altered food. Personally I think that at least analyzing your unborn children will be the future, and standing in the way of progress has never helped anybody. 

Inheritance: What angers me the most with this initiative are a) that they include everything back to 2012 (violates the constitution, it's not even certain if this is legal) and b) they have been changing the numbers for family businesses time and time again. Unformulated initiatives have time and time again proven themselves to be incredibly frustrating because the ever so important details need to be passed by both chambers of parliament. Just think of the recent examples (Zweitwohnung, Masseneinwanderung, Marche Blanche) and how everyone is everyone from left to right is yelling ""This is unreasonable! This violates the spirit of the initiative!"" to any proposition. Well fuck you, how about you present the details for the people to vote on with the initiative. Too afraid it might not pass? That means it's probably shit to begin with, so save everyone the headache just to pat yourselves on the back for being ""close to the people"" and do it right or not at all.

Stipends: I think that if the cantons have to deal with the universities, they should also be the ones dealing with the stipends. Living in a canton with low taxes (like Schwyz) means you get low public service (like stipends) so take the money you are not giving society and support your offspring, don't burden it upon the state. 

Billag: I accept this mostly so people finally shut the fuck up about this. Almost everyone has a device on which they can watch TV (including laptops and smartphones and public viewings during the world cup), and if you are one of the very special snowflakes who has nothing at all then congratulations, you are now taking one for the team. Go you! Maybe the next time you use one of the many perfectly maintained hiking trails in the mountains or go to the playground with your kids you'll think of all the people who never use either of those things yet pay for it with their tax money. It's what being in a society means.

I don't know why you are making this a left vs right argument, I try to evaluate every initiative irrespective of where it came from and I happen to be in favor of all the policies you stated above.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not against taxation but in this case we are talking about money that was already taxed a first time upon acquisition and a second time with wealth taxation, do we really want to tax it a third time ? This seems very unfair to me and will most certainly drive people away, I know it would drive me away if I was concerned.

on the recruitment, you'll have psychological tests (in front of a computer, and depending on your answers, with a psy.) you will then have a visit with a doctor. 

about your back problems, taking certificates and radiographies might help your case.

about the way things work : 
if you are considered fit for the military and don't want to do it : you'll have the possibility to do civil service (it might change in the future, some controversies and recent news on the subject).

if you are unable (inapte in french) to go to the army you'll have to go to the civil protection (means : serving a few days each years, and paying a bit of tax).

and finally if you are considered unable to do the civil protection you will have to pay (and only that). but to be unable to do the civil protection, you have to be totally fucked up (either mentally or physically): i mean : being in a rollchair, having very strong psychological deseases (like loads of violence/very severe anxiety and stuff) which are almost impossible to fake (they have trained professional psys to check that).

Being addicted to drugs propably won't save you from the civil protection (and may even not be a reason to miss the army (case dependent i suppose)).

You choose whatever you want to do in this recruitment, as stated by others, lying to avoid your duties because you see no interest in the thing is actually going against the system that whishes the participation of every citizen in the public life and defense.

Why I chose to go to the army and why you could choose to do the same. 

it's not obligatory 1 year straight, you can spend 4 month and then 3 weeks during 6 years: two advantages : 
you get 4 month of ""fun"" (creating friendships with people you would probably have never met before; doing incredible stuff (depending on the position) you wouldn't do anywere else). 
And then, you get to have 3 weeks more out of your job(3 weeks ""holidays"" more ), where you meet these same friends again (or others but you'll get by) and have a chance to share drinks fairly often (or maby it's just for the ""romands"" ;) ).

You have a chance to get skills you would strugle (have to pay a lot of money) to find elswere.

fancy driving a motorrad, a truck, a boat? certains positions will teachyou to drive special vehicles (with licences valid in the civil), and learning to drive will probably spare you quite a bit of time out of the mud.

Want to do certain professions? the army might help (firefighter, policeman, border control, horses related weird posts...)

Want to become a manager, to have a leading position, to gain experience? if you're smart, and willfull, the army will be glad to provide you with teaching and experience (it's fairly well paid (and you'll have to stay longer too) and you have quite a lot of responsability and experience to show in the end.

On the monetary side, if you are still studying, 4 month in the army means quite a bit of money on side to start.

why not the other options : 
civil service : quite hard to find interesting stuff to do, longer than the military.
civil protection : you'll end up with people that were considered too crasy to go to the army, lasy folks and weird peoples that could make you have the worse time of your life (or not, loads of nice people too). Depending on your position : it may suck to have only 2-3 days every now and then in the year and not a fix amount to serve. 

Good Luck in your choice !

Taking an equal percentage from everyone isn't fair. If you take 5% of what a poor person has, that makes them even poorer. If you take 5% of what a very rich person has, they'll be slightly less rich. That's why we have progressive taxes: because the more money you have, the larger proportion of it you can afford to give away.

Remember that the point of taxes is to pay for government services, and the point of these services is to help people. Taking money from people who don't have much and using that money to fund a very tiny fraction of government services is less efficient than simply not taking their money.

&gt; We are talking about the introduction of a new tax and whether or not it is necessary, just and well implemented.

These criteria are good, but they are relative, not absolute. The question is, do we have a better alternative?  
The Federal Council agrees that social security is under-funded, and their proposal is to raise VAT by 1.5% to fund it. VAT is the exact opposite of a progressive tax: the more money you have, the less you care about it. I do think that an inheritance tax is better than this alternative.",null,0,null,1433107234,null,0,false,0,crr6guk,null,t3_37xsbt,null,t1_crr6guk,null,t1_crr5hxt,null,null,null,1433503592,null,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2,null
