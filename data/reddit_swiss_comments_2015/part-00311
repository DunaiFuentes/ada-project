That wasn't my question. Not getting married in church and a civil union is not the same thing.

As an atheist I don't care if god is present when I marry my loved one. So instead of going to the church and having a priest do the ceremony I go the government and have a government official marry us.

Now me and my new wife have the *exact* same legal rights as you have who married your spouse in the church. They're the same in front of the government.

Also both versions are also equally accepted in society. They are more or less the same for society. We call both version marriage. Most people won't inquire if we actually married in church or the registry office.

My point is that marriage *without religion* is already widely accepted and legally a non-issue. It's only a religious thing by choice of the two individuals who got married and maybe also their families.

As far as I'm concerned, gays shouldn't have the right to adopt, because civil or religious marriage doesn't change a thing to the fact that nature says gays can't reproduce. So they should not have kids. Plus, I'm very much against merchandising human beings, even if they're kids.  

&gt;why is it a problem when the two individuals have the same gender?

As far as I'm concerned, it's a problem because they can adopt. As i already said, children are no merchandise and shouldn't be. 

And since it seems to matter: I'm not an atheist, but I'm not a religious bigot either, as both are the two sides of a same coin. So I'm not against ""gay marriage"" (in the sense of a religious union that consequently allows to adopt children) because of religious grounds.
