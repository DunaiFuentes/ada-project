null,false,SwissBliss,vd,Vaud/Valais,null,"Oh well you've come to the right place. I'll repost some I've already posted caused I've answered similar questions in a few other threads:

1. Between Geneva and Lausanne, you go up the Jura to a small town called St Cergue. There is literally the best burger place in Switzerland called Rando Burger. Trust me, go there
Other than that, not far away but you go up the Jura in a slightly different place. Go up to La Dole and there is a tiny restaurant called Chalet/Buvette de La Dole. Amazing food, super chill environment, middle of nowhere, animals right next to you, and a hike to the ball on the mountain

2. Anywhere between Geneva and Lausanne is stunning http://www.lavaux-unesco.ch/data/dataimages/upload/ambianceHome6.jpg 
But if you want to go to an ""off the beaten path"" area, then I HIGHLY recommend camping/hiking around La Dole in Vaud. http://goo.gl/5UJH92 This is on the Jura mountains. When you get to this small chalet/restaurant it is completely surrounded by wilderness (forests, creeks and such, and a great view of Lake Geneva), and you can climb to that ball on the mountain in about 40 minutes, and 20 minutes back down. I've camped there many times and it's beautiful especially when you walk through those cow fields and through the forest. Find a clearing and pitch a tent. Just be aware of boars. I've never seen one but you'll definitely see the tracks they leave Edit:St Cergue is beautiful too. St Cergue is amazing so you could just stay in that region and go in the plentiful forest. If you do go there, go to Rando Burger, best Burger in Switzerland imo. Also while you hike you'll probably randomly encounter a refuge to eat and drink so that's nice. Really the whole Jura mountain is beautiful because it's not high enough to be full of snow all year, instead you just have nature at its finest. If you have any question about the French speaking part of Switzerland just ask :)
Another quick little spot that I found maybe 7 years ago: http://imgur.com/a/FFtcs#0 
I made the directions from the closest town. It's on the way up to La Dole as mentioned above. Basically it's a nice little lake/pond in the woods, and if you go up through the woods from there by foot, and follow the river up you'll get to a place I like to call ""paradise"". Basically it's a sloped ""river"" (very shallow, like 3cm deep) down the mountain with tons of moss growing in the stream, and I usually walk up it bare foot which is really cold, but nice.

Please ask if you have any questions :)

Edit: Here's another post I found, sorry if this is a bit of a mess of a comment, I'm just copy pasting my old comments.

- When do you plan to go? Because it can be harder to get there in winter because they close the roads due to snow, and since the only thing up there is a small refuge and a restaurant further away, it isn't much of a big deal. In Summer there can be a few tourists but not many.

Here is a quick map of the area with 3 pictures. Basically from Geneva you go East along the lake until you reach Nyon, then you go up to the mountain and follow that road I indicated. Once your up there you can do whatever you want. Hike (fairly easy) up to the ball (La Dole), enjoy the view of Lake Geneva on one side and France on the other, eat and chill at the refuge, and then just walk around the endless forests till you find a place to put a tent up.

The problem is how far they go. 
In Switzerland there is press freedom, more than many other countries in Europe, but sometimes there are bad episodes of abuse (e.g. the journalist that had all his stuff seized while working away from the newspaper's headquarters for a bs reason), so I guess there is press freedom not because the courts don't have enough power, but because they usually use it sparingly.

Generally we have ""exercises"" (we call it Übung) but it is more like a meeting) every Saturday from 14:00 - 17:00 (2pm - 5pm :P). I am leading a group of cubs so we don't really do real hiking (although we do go walking longer distances in camps). 

We usually meet up near the forest and most of the time do different activities (e.g. playing games, following a trail of clues, make a fire and grill, build stuff at our group place which is our hidden place where we can hang out etc.). Most of the time we tie in a story into these activities. Which makes it a bit more interesting and gives a sort of goal.  
From time to time we also do some more action packed stuff like building canopy or bridges and stuff like that. 

Then we also have some special events over the year where we do promotion ""Übungen"" in town to do some publicity work. Or we are at the local fairs (chilbi) with a stand where we sell stuff. 

And of course the annual camps we make where we do a lot of different stuff. 

And then of course there are events that we just do in the group of leaders (i.e. without the boyscouts and cubs) but these are actually more like things you just do with a group of friends (although they are still somewhat connected to values we share as scouts). Some examples would participating in the ""[Siechä Marsch](http://siech.ch/index.php?r=siech/home)"" Which is a 50, 80 or 100km hike, abseiling, visiting a ""[scouts openair](www.pff15.ch)"" which is an openair but organized by scouts for scouts (yeah we aren't just the friendly people that are strict and disciplined (we are though when doing our duty :P), and a lot of other stuff. 

If you have any other questions or something wasn't clear just ask :) I'm happy to give answers.

**EDIT:**  
Maybe regarding the tasks we have to do. Basically the Swiss Scouting Association (Pfadi Bunder Schweiz or PBS) has, like most associations oriented around outdoor activities and sports, a partnership with the ""Jugend &amp; Sport"" organization which belongs to the Department of Defense, Civil protection and Sports (VBS) of the government.  
If we do a camp we can apply for a J&amp;S subsidy of (IIRC) 5.5 Swiss Francs per participant per day. But in order to receive that we need to have a certain number of leaders who have done courses (which J&amp;S defines what has to be learned at those).  
These courses are held by other scout leaders who have already done them (and the course leader needs to have done even other courses to lead the course). I'm actually currently also leading one of these course this year (the main camp will start next Saturday).  
The younger scout leaders learn a lot of skills in these course on how to plan ""Übungen"" and in the 2nd course also how to plan a camp week.  
Furthermore J&amp;S demands that if we want to apply a camp for subsidy we must fulfill some requirements (e.g. having at least 2 hours of sport and in total 4 hours of camp activity per day). 

I can also give you more insight on this if you like.

Te one thing that requires advance planning is the triggers.  Particle detectors capture *far* more data than can be stored, and there's a complex series of software filters that throw out 99+% of the events; what's stored is a tiny fraction of 1%.

People running experiments *do* care about making sure the data which is useful *to them* survives the filters.

But all of the experimental groups get access to all of the data, and then perform their own analysis on it.


Okay, so the difference is two things:

1. Higher energy.  That means more rare processes, which means more information.  
2. 25 ns bunches as opposed to 50 ns.  This allows higher luminosity (interesting particle collisions per second) with less pile-up (number of simultaneous collisions).

Another difference is that the detectors have been upgraded.",null,0,null,1428918038,null,0,false,0,cqao0xu,null,t3_31wtvy,null,t1_cqao0xu,null,t1_cq60537,null,null,null,1432361564,null,1,false,CERN,t5_2r692,1,null

Since you have no paper trail in switzerland it might be difficult to get an appartment in Switzerland.

It's a short drive up from Nyon, and there are plenty of easy through to hard hiking paths in the area.

At the end you can buy fresh mountain cheese, and you'll also be treated to an exceptional view. The walk up to la Barilette (large tower you can see in the Jura above Nyon) is really nice as well, but it's a bit harder. If you continue up from la Barilette all the way up to the peak of la dole (airport radar), you'll get an insane view - plus there is a great restaurant you can walk down to a few minutes away. Finally there are also a bunch of great walking areas around la givrine, a few minutes up from St cergue. In the winter it's a also a great place to go sledding or cross country skiing. There are a bunch of other great routes in the area, with lots of interesting and beautiful places that I'd recommend you to check out. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me.
