It should be ""und du?""!

""dir"" is more along the lines of ""your(s)"" while ""du"" means ""you"". 

Also since we have [polite form (of address)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific) in our speech, one should be aware of the fact that saying ""du"" to a person of honor (generally everybody you don't know, is older than you or even teachers) can come of as disrespectful. In those cases one should use ""Sie"" instead (Note capitalization).  
So ""und du?"" becomes ""und Sie?"". Pronounced ""(u)nd doo"" and ""(u)nd see"" respectively.

Mostly people are comfortable with being, what we call, ""du~zt"" as opposed to ""Sie~zt"", just ask politely if you can ""du~z"" them.
