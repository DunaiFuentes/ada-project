My main point is this: You can't learn proper German or improve your German skills in Switzerland by talking to locals.

Portugal has a so called Schengen Deal with Switzerland. You can enter Switzerland for 3 Months and look for a job. If you don't find work you'll have to leave. Otherwise you just start working.


**Salary question**
I did a 4 year apprenticeship and got a certificate as Software developer. No university.  My entry level salary was 5200 CHF. A friend who did a Bachelor in IT started at 6000 CHF. 

Those numbers a gross. There are lots of deductions. 

If you have a bachelor degree and 1.5 years experience you will start at about 6600 - 7000 CHF / Month (13x)


**Rent**:
Rent in and around Zürich is ~ 1200 - 1500 CHF. for a 1 Room to 3 Room Appartment. 


**Healthcare**:
For me (25yr. Male) Healthcare is 325 a month. But there are cheaper ones, starting at ~225. But you get what you pay for. higher retention for example. 


**Will you be rich**:
If you work in Switzerland you will have a lot of spending capacity compared to most other countrys. But you will struggle if you don't have a job paying more than 60000 CHF a year. 

**Big need for Software devs**: 
True, if you have a degree!
