We were older, though -- fresh out of college. 18 is young, you're not even done with college and neither is she, presumably. Of course you could go to school in Switzerland or she in the USA, but it's a big commitment, let alone immigrating here or there permanently.

I am biased but I like the idea of moving to Switzerland so you don't get enslaved by the loathsome US student loan system, since you have a choice now.

Anyway, you will have a hard time moving to Switzerland long-term unless you two are married. The reverse is also true, immigration to the USA is essentially impossible without marriage. If you enrolled in a Swiss school, then you'd have a way of staying for a while, but you'd have to have a source of income so you can show the government that you have the means to support yourself financially while living in Switzerland, and all bets are off once you graduate.

While Burgdorf isn't a particularly interesting town, you have great train connections to other places. If you like hiking, Interlaken is a great hub. You can reach loads of cool places from there. If you want to wander around, browsing shops and sightsee, some of the bigger cities might be interesting.  
A couple of ideas:  

-  Take the train from Burgdorf to Meiringen, either via Bern-&gt;Interlaken-&gt;Meiringen or Olten-&gt;Lucerne-&gt;Meiringen. The view from the train is quite scenic. In Meiringen you can take the cable car to Hasliberg where you have nice hiking trails.

- Bern or Lucerne. Both of these cities have beautiful old towns and a lot of opportunities to sight see. Lucerne especially is known as a ""must see"" for tourists with sights like the Kappelbrücke or the Lion Monument.  
Bern also has a beautiful old town with a lot of hidden shops and bars you could explore and if you get bored of that, just hang around one of the many parks and chill in the sun (depending on the weather of course).

That's all I got from the top of my head. In any case I'd suggest downloading the SBB app so you know exactly when and where all the trains go. If you have more questions I'll be happy to help.

There are a lot of boats and the streaming will bring you to Thun (the lake of Thun flows to the River of the aare in thun), so that is another challenge when Kayaking. here is my idea for you:

Day one, go to Kandersteg. (you only have to change trains in Berne, 1.5h with the train). When you arrive in Kandersteg, you can hike up to the Lake Oeschinen.

It's one of my favourite places in the area. And not too crowded! you can go down with a little cable railway. You find the hike routes on the following site. [link] (http://www.oeschinensee.ch/en/summer/hiking/).

You return to thun and sleep in a hostel. on day 2, you spend the morning in the city (there is a beautiful castle with an awesome view and there are also some other hidden spots with beautiful views or places I could tell you. On noon, you get to the Aare (river) and rent one of the following [pieces] (http://www.aaretubing.ch/) and go down the Aare to get back to Bern. They take your stuff with a car to bern where you leave the river  and they give you your stuff back and you give them the tube. By the way, if you choose the tube (the round thing), you start in Uttigen, which is like 10 minutes with the train from thun, because there is a big wave in Uttigen which is too dangerous with this small thing. [pic](http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/77787159.jpg).

I absolutely love going down the aare, [picture] (https://imgur.com/xCRmWA3) from yesterday. :D It will probably look like [this](http://blog.bernerzeitung.ch/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2013/08/66-12987816.jpg). not too crowded, but it's cool to just float around with random people and have a chat with them.

I admit, you won't see Interlaken with my plan, but to be honest it's just a really small city that sells overly expensive souvenirs and isn't really worth visiting. It's kinda cheesy. You'll see more Indian and Asian people in Interlaken than people from Interlaken. 

Also with my idea, you get both the hike and a bit of water action.
