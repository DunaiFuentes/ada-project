1. Switzerland vs. Italy economy and politics. Take your pick

2. Beauty: It's so close. About equal. You'll also be close to Milan, Geneva, Zurich etc, all nice places

3. Switzerland is the land of public transport. There is zero competition there. You can go literally anywhere in Switzerland by public transport of any kind (train, bus, boat, etc etc) with just 1 pass. Always on time, good quality, and super easy with an Iphone app.

4. Language: Same mostly, although you may here other Swiss languages like german and french and romansch also spoken there occasionally. I don't know if you speak Italian (which I guess you do considering you want to go to Italy or Ticino), but even if you don't, most people in Switzerland speak at least decent english. Can't say the same for Italy if I'm honest.

5. People: I'm sure people from both regions are nice

6. Education: Again no discussion there. Switzerland

7. Culture: To each there own I guess. In Ticino you'll get a mix of Swiss and Italian.

Geneva---&gt;Montreux Car/Train Ride along the lake is surreal with the Alps plunging into the lake on one side, and the Vineyards on the other (at sunrise or sunset is best)

Lavaux Vineyards. World heritage site. Beautiful and you can try some wine

Here's a hidden gem: Not far from Geneva, go to the mountains, to a place called La Dole (http://imgur.com/VteOEzk). There's a really small and beautiful refuge below the Radar at the top (the golf ball looking one) http://www.visinand.ch/rando/pieds/Sommets/Vaud/Dole/2013_juin/2013_06%20La%20Dole_015.JPG

Basically get to that refuge, have lunch, and then climb to the ball on top of the mountain, admire the view, and come back down to the refuge to have a drink. The hike from the refuge to the ball takes less than an hour back and forth.
