No, the more centrist the better. SP/Greens/SVP add little value. I would prefer it if we would move to a system where people in the National Council would get elected by the same concept as the Council of States (first-past-the-post system / winner takes it all).

It would also reduce the influence of parties and get rid of this nonsense that you can vote for ""lists"" that represent parties. Party politics is pretty useless anyway. I think an ideal system would be where people vote more smartvote style (the online platform) to put the focus more on topics/issues and away from politicians.

I also think that the federal council should consist of non-politicians only and all council members should be well paid top specialists/experts (e.g. former managers, professors...) instead  of amateurish politicians.
