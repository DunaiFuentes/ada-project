* Only the dealer should be able to see your delivery address (which most likely is your real name).

You don't want your address popping up in a server log should the police ever seize the market place (or worse, take it over secretly).

* Use Tor or TAILS to hide your IP and your online identity from online surveillance. If the police busts your dealer and finds your address on an unshipped package they better not find a log entry from your ISP (or NSA database for that matter, happened before) that says you connected to a darknet market during the last week.

* For the same reason you have to anonymize your Bitcoin payments. Every transaction in Bitcoin is totally in the open and can be traced back for all eternity. You can buy Bitcoins from an online exchange but they usually ask for IDs, utility bills and the fingerprints of your firstborn before they let you trade. Therefore you have to obfuscate that trail, otherwise the police could just trace back a payment from a busted dealers wallet until they hit a wallet of an exchange and ask whose account was responsible for that payment. This is always a little tricky because you will have to trust some shady anonymous bitcoin mixing service with your coins to get complete untraceability.

I try to clarify this with a little calculation:


Let's say a rich person earns 20'000.- a month with 10% income tax
So he has to pay 2000.-
Now the child aids become tax-free
His income now is 19550.- and because of the tax-Progression he only has to pay 9,5% taxes.
So he only pays 1857,25.-


Now we apply the same formula to a poor person
This person earns 2000.- a month with 1% income tax
He has to pay 20.-
Without the child aid he only has 1550.- taxable income and he gets taxed with a rate of 0,75% which is 11,625.- in his case.


So the rich person saves 142,75.- or 0,71375% of his income. The poor person saves 8,375.- which is 0.41875% of his income so the poor person saves less than the rich.

I know it's very simplified but that was my immediate thought when I read the dossier.

And the higher the tax, the less people will use non-renewable energies, so the tax needs to be even higher... and so on and so forth.

Since there's no tax on renewable energies, if the end goal - eliminate or drastically reduce the use of non-renewable energy - is reached, the federal government will have lost a massive part of its income.
