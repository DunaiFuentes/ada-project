If you are not prepared for long walks or can't find a decent amount of time to spend playing with the dog, I would advise against getting an Appenzeller. 

Some people might say that Appenzellers and some other breeds are not good for first time owners but I tend to disagree. If you spent time with your dog and take good care of it by training and walking it, any breed of dog can and will be your best friend.

A very important aspect is that Appenzellers are very protective of their territory. They often bark against about any intruder but they do not tend to bite. 

Other than that, they are wonderful dogs. My mother has gotten another dog now and I love it but I still miss my [Curry](http://i.imgur.com/594u3xe.jpg).
