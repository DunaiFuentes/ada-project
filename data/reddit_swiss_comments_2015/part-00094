What I can give you on the way: I don't know how much you'll earn or where you'll work but you should definitely look into public transportation. Depending on where you live in the US that might be uncommon but seriously here in Switzerland it's a viable alternative (even though the trains aren't as punctual as they used to be). And if you work IN the city it's really the only option because traffic is really really bad in Switzerland.

Another thing you should get used to is that stores are closed on Sundays. Only shops open are little shops  in railway stations or gas stations. But they have a very limited stock. Depending on your budget you want to shop at Denner/Lidl/Aldi (low cost) or at Coop/Migros (they have low-priced stuff but you can also find high quality products for a little more money).
