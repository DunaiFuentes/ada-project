That salary is way too low. At any Big4 consulting firms in Switzerland you can expect at least 80K CHF with these qualifications. At some firms you can even expect 90-95K CHF base salary and 3~7K CHF bonus.  

Typically salaries in Basel and Zurich are the same for tech companies. In Bern they are about 3~5k CHF less.I would assume salaries around Luzern to be slightly less than the ones in Zurich closer to the salaries in Bern.
