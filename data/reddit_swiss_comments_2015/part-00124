null,false,BASWAacoustic,null,null,null,"Yes similar depending on the system you are referring to. Most underfloor systems integrate heating through long electric resistors. We use water capillary systems. They are not coiled and run parallel for maximum flow. (Parallel rather than coiled) 

The energy saving comes from the efficiency of heat transfer. The huge surface area and use of water in lieu of forced air mean the water in the system needs cooled (or heated) to less of a delta to acheive the desired temperature. For example, a forced air system will chill coils to near 0 degrees Celsius in order to chill the air, which in turn is forced into the room. The energy needed to move from the ambient temperature to the needed temperature is exponential. With a radient system such as BASWA cool, the water in the capillaries needs to be cooled (or heated) to a much smaller difference to achieve the same result. 

Another major benefit is the cooling and heating is very uniform. I hope this helps.

unfortunately, a while ago, I edited the 1st question(s) in my previous comment. so it seems you answered something like *is it similar to common underfloor cooling/heating systems?*.

I wasn't aware that *most underfloor systems integrate heating through long electric resistors*. maybe that's for installed systems as opposed to those being installed nowadays... but still, is it for CH? I would imagine it being the case in F but am surprised for CH.

So correct me if I'm wrong but to evaluate BAWSA cool, we should really distinguish:

- heating: compared to common *hydronic* underfloor heating... does your system perform similarly and is only attractive because it combines cooling? or is the efficiency also superior in heating mode (that's when I expect an explanation on the role of convection)?
- cooling: you compared it to typical blown air systems common in CH, but in my new set of questions I compare it with ceiling-integrated tubes systems, that I think are common in warm developed regions. is BAWSA cool different in design and performance?

beside: asking all these questions, I realize BAWSA cool can be interesting while having comparable performance to other existing products (in this case: ceiling-integrated tubes systems): either just as good or cheaper to install, more reliable, etc.
