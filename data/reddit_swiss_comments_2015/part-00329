null,null,Rimbaud_,ba-sc,,null,"I guess this will be your first year on campus and that you aren't Swiss. 

Most students have jobs as TAs (teaching assistants) however this generally means that you need to have passed the class with a good grade previously. 

You can always find small jobs on myjob.epfl.ch (can't link the URL right now, sorry). These are small various jobs which can go from babysitting to iOS developer. 

I'd recommend these two first, because the EPFL will help you sort out everything that is tax related if you aren't a Swiss student and most jobs on myjob are too small to have any legal signification. 


Next you have the Junior Enterprise EPFL. They basically serve as a relay between companies and students. Companies need some job X done, they contact the JE, the JE will then search for a student which can accomplish job X. The convenient part here is that most of the time you will be working for the JE and not the company which in most cases guarantees a bit more work safety on your side and they will help you with the whole legal part. I have some experiences with them, their contracts are very fair. However, I have no idea what their policies are for foreigners. 

As for actual part time jobs near the campus, by this I mean stuff like a cashier, paperboy, ... It is extremely limited. Switzerland is quite tight on small jobs and companies do not employ people who don't have the exact papers/certificates asked for the job. Even if it's some extremely basic job like a receptionist you will need some kind of degree in that field, Switzerland is quite weird for that. Of course there are exceptions to what I just said, cashiers are mostly students but there are very few jobs to take.  

What I personally do is work as a TA and do some small side jobs when I can. The JE is great if you find something for which you have the necessary skills, however most of them are every time demanding as they are considered as regular jobs (30-45 hours per week), so you'll have to see if you can add that to your studies. As you might be new to the campus you might want to check out online tutoring as a replacement for being a TA.

Watching lots of diy videos and doing a bit of electronics myself, I'm highly disappointed in how Switzerland treats their creative minds (compared to the USofA where you get anything everywhere or Germany where you get everything in larger towns). There is literally not a single shop in a 1 hour vicinity of mine that sells components such as LEDs and resistors, or the mechanical stuff like flanges.

I used to buy most of my stuff at conrad.ch because they have a huge catalogue of things. However they have the shittiest packaging departement, everything costs Mindermengenzuschlag (5.-) and Verpackungspauschale (8.90) so if I ever have to buy a pack of low power red leds and nothing else I have to get them shipped from Zurich in a box that is too large to fit in my mailbox so the next day I missed it because people actually have to work and I can only pick it up the day after while paying almost 15.- in extra cost for a 5.- set of plastic that could have been mailed by envelope.

My suggestion: find a hackerspace in your region and visit it often. They have machines and many many parts you can buy and use and they have combined orders that make the shipping cost be neglectable. As a single person at home, Switzerland is the worst land for doing creative stuff because it always ends up being suuuuuuper expensive. Thanks to this I've practically given up doing electronics and gone back to software only, which sucks in my opinion, but there's no other way :/",null,0,null,1440504286,null,null,false,0,cueyvgm,null,t3_3ibmpx,null,null,null,t3_3ibmpx,null,null,null,1441485589,null,4,null,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,4,null

&gt;I'm not a foreigner, it's funny how people assume that.

Well, you know... If you keep writing about ""the Swiss"", you sort of put you in an outside position, so it's not that weird to assume that.


&gt;And it's just as much the responsibility of a country to allow integration then it is the task of the foreigners.

ಠ_ಠ Yeeees. So tell me... What are we doing wrong? Except of course bashing and talking shit about everyone, apparently. I am absolutely convinced that if a foreigner speaks the language, he will be treated like everybody else. So if somebody doesn't speak the language, is it our fault if we don't give them jobs? There is a communication barrier and it's not the task of the person living in their home country to break through it. We have FOUR official languages, it's not that fucking hard.

&gt;That the Swiss blame the foreigners for not integrating pretty much proves all my point. It's exactly that xenophobia, arrogance and complacency I'm talking about. The Swiss would never admit that they are part of the problem. So let's blame the foreigners.

Please elaborate again. Of course we blame the foreigners who have trouble getting integrated, I personally believe that they aren't trying hard enough or that they came to Switzerland with the wrong expectations. The City of Zürich offers free German courses. People who are here applying for asylum get language courses. What about all the ones who have zero problems with integrating?

&gt;No offense, but that is a right wing fantasy and simply not true.

(I'm pretty left-winged by the way, just to get that out there.) Of course it's an exaggerated statement, that's the idea! But I am actually quite convinced that it would work out. How one finds such clubs? How about googling ""Jodelclub + *your city*""?

&gt;Even if you start talking to a stranger in a bar you get strange looks and reactions in Switzerland.

That's a good point, we have asses up our sticks. But so what? We just don't have a bar culture, so deal with it. There are many other ways you can get to know people. Bars are not one of them (in Switzerland).

&gt;Also, a lot of those clubs are dominated by ultra conservatives, so how much fun is it as a foreigner to spend your evening listening to some xenophobic view (and occupationally they might say something like ""but of course you are different"" to make it not too awkward)?

I have no idea. Everything you and I say wis purely speculation so we can't really comment on it.

&gt;We don't even speak German and you can't really learn Swiss German as it isn't really a language with grammar and everything. Basically you would have to learn German and the slowly transform into Swiss German.

Yeah so? Of course you need to have basic German skills and then work on it from there, but you don't need to go through that weird process that you mentioned. You can do both side-by-side, it's a very liquid process. You could also just speak High German, not a single problem with that. You just need to be able to understand Swiss German. Never have I ever met somebody who was offended by High German.

&gt;Also, again, the Swiss are super hostile towards other people trying to speak their language. People are even complaining if Germans try to say Grüezi.

Just fuck off with your stupid allegations that have no grain of truth to them! That's just the most stupid thing I have ever heard said about Switzerland in my life! People who are trying are rewarded with respect. Sure you might laugh at the way the Germans are pronouncing ""Krützi"", but you'd still respect them for trying.

&gt;It is, if you are from Zurich you get shitty treatment in the rest of Switzerland all the time. Basically you first have to take their shit and then, maybe, if you are extra nice to them despite their hostility then they actually change their mind. It's exactly that xenophobic culture I am talking about.

No! You don't get it, it's just playful! It's not real! IN case you're still convinced particularly about the Zürich accent, read this: http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wissen/zuerichdeutsch-beliebter-als-berndeutsch/story/24060764

&gt;If you even have a Swiss passport and you still aren't accepted then there clearly it's Switzerland that is to blame for it.

This is true, but does that actually happen? Most probably not. Or if it does, then there is some other story behind it. I just refuse to believe your anecdotal make-believe hypothesis.

&gt;Basically your argument is that if you don't become just like some ultra Swiss nationalist you aren't welcome. 

No, that's not what I said. Stop twisting my words. I said, nobody would know because of the way I was brought up. That just means it's because I have been taught the Swiss culture and ticks from the start because I am Swiss. But some people think they can just behave exactly the same as in their home country but it doesn't work like that. You have to adapt in the way people act and behave. Just copy other people on the street, it's not too much to ask.

&gt;Isn't this simply another way to describe a xenophobic culture?

No, it isn't. It's a culture that is dedicated to the ""here and now"".


&gt;That's totally normal in the UK and most countries have faster and easier process for citizenship. It's deeply undemocratic to refuse people their political rights for no reason. Even someone that does everything at trying to integrate doesn't get any better treatment.

Too bad, I think five years is ridiculously little (unless you have some sort of connection to the country in question). I've lived abroad for some time and I would certainly not expect to already be given citizenship after five years. That would be completely ridiculous. And so what if other countries do it differently? People are welcome to become citizens there. But most people don't even want to become citizens. It's not undemocratic, if you don't like it, then leave. I know this sounds very stupid and rightist, but nobody is forcing anybody to come to Switzerland.

&gt;I lived in London for a few year and I was more integrated than in Zurich (and I'm Swiss). Also it's very easy to learn a language in five year, maybe unless it's Swiss German and that's certainly not to fault of the foreigners (and not an official language).

Well, Boohoo. You learned English. Congratulations. The languages in Switzerland are German, French and Italian. Should we make English an official language, too? No other European country does this. Learn the local language or go somewhere else.

&gt;That's another Swiss fantasy. E.g. if you pay local tax in the UK you get local voting rights. That simple. That's what democracy is about, not that Swiss pseudo-democratic system were so many people have no political rights even after a decade.

Like I said, I support local voting rights for foreigners. But do you get to elect parliament as a foreigner in the UK? Do you get to vote on constitutional changes? No? I didn't think so.


&gt;I never said that. My point was that people that behave, pay taxes and speak the language should get citizenship.

Okay. Maybe 12 years is over the top, but IMHO, 5 years is too little. People need to prove that they're committed.


&gt;That you have to wait over a decade? Then some random people will have to vote on you after you went so bizarre, ridiculous procedure.

This we can agree on. The process is way to arbitrary and dependant on the local people. Then again, you just have to chose your place of residence carefully. ;) /s

&gt;That's a topic for itself but this article was about why expats don't like the Swiss culture and clearly that's a reason for it.

Well, maybe some expats should've informed themselves before coming to live in Switzerland. We get so many posts on this subreddit of people who have the total wrong idea about Switzerland.

&gt;lol, that's just absurd. So those angry people can be xenophobic and I'm not allowed to say anything?! Again, exactly proofs my point. Racism/xenophobia is such a big taboo in Switzerland. Honestly, fuck those ""angry people"".

Yes, fuck those people. But screaming back is not the way. A fight is always two-sided and you're not exactly being the quiet voice of reason.

&gt;Switzerland has slowly change into becoming more and more nationalistic, xenophobic and arrogant.

Uhm, no? Just how xenophobic do you think Switzerland was 50 years ago?

&gt;The SVP has done a prefect job at making hostility toward foreigners a legit thing. Just go to a foreign country and show the people the SVP campaign ads. Again, neither my friends nor I are left wingers and everyone I ever showed a SVP ads instantly agreed that it's obviously racism/xenophobia and got this slightly disgusted look on their faces when they hear that this is the biggest party in this country and totally legit. I mean how surprising is it that expats don't like Swiss culture when a major part of the population is obsessed with hating them?

Sigh. That's just not true. Just because SVP has a lot of seats doesn't mean that a major part of the population hates foreigners. Anyway, what's with all the strong words? I'm pretty sure that the amount of people who actually HATE foreigners in this country is really, really low.


&gt;Okay, this becomes kind of repetitive but clearly it's not the job of a foreigner to overcome the xenophobia of the Swiss. Again, not very surprising that expats don't like a culture that works like that.

Why not? You can't just expect to waltz in somewhere and be the star of the dance. Swiss people have to be taught, and the only way this is going to happen is if they have positive experiences with foreigners.


&gt;Again, this is what I mean with Switzerland being such a fucked up culture. The xenophobic farmer should be ashamed, instead it is romanticized.

Yes, he should be ashamed if he didn't change his mind. But if he does, then that's a good thing. Right? Isn't that exactly what you're saying?

&gt;Culturally you have to blame the foreigner, that's the norm in Switzerland.

Well for things that have come up because of foreigners that's not totally grasped out of thin air. The problem is the generalisation and the money that some parties possess to spew their messages. SVP is very far from a people's party, they only care about their own financial situation. And this is what we need to teach people. To open their eyes. Then people will also stop blaming every foreigner for problems that a minority of them caused.

&gt;What?! Nobody EVER does that.

You did. And it's not that I completely disagree with you, but there is middle ground. You can't just blame only us Swiss like you do. That's not how it works. And whether you believe it or not, the behaviour of immigrants and how hard they actually tries, has a lot to do with their success. Expats are different anyway, because they have no interests in staying for a long time, they know they'll be leaving again soon. And they're mostly financially stable so they also don't need to, e.g. learn the language to feed their kids.
