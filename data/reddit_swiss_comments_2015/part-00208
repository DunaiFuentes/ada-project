Basic insurance is all the same, which is nearly identical to the nationalised health care Canadians receive, right down to the fact that out of province hospital trips are incredibly expensive. The Swiss system makes it much easier to buy insurance covering out of canton hospital visits for a much lower fee, while in Canada you need to buy 3rd party insurance.

Good, means you can financially punish them by taking your money elsewhere if they don't perform to your expectations.

They don't in Canada either, doctors get kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies.


&gt;No choices in level of care: all people rich and poor receive the same care at the same hospitals.

You've obviously never spent time in a Canadian hospital. You can pay for extra care.

&gt;No profit means that all decisions are based on the health of the patient.

Completely backwards. There's still a profit. Canada has a major problem with doctors only allowing one issue per visit, so they get the max amount of money possible per patient. It also clogs up the system and causes unnecessary wait times.

&gt;Centralized accounting results in far greater efficiency.

Evidently not. No matter how you cut it, Swiss are more efficient at nearly everything than Canadians.

Some people cannot afford the money that it costs just to get the citizenship, meanwhile any millionaire can come to this country and buy their way to citizenship without giving two fucks about Switzerland, the culture and society. Also even after fulfilling all the requirements there's still no guarantee that you will become a citizen, and even *after* getting the citizenship, there's still the problem of not being considered a ""true"" Swiss because their family doesn't trace back to a shit ton of inbred ""Eidgenosse"" that lived in the same valley for centuries, these people are then called ""Papier-Schwiizer"", because even after paying a certain amount of money and going through all the bureaucracy to become a citizen, they still don't deserve to be called Swiss because their blood is somehow tainted.

Not to mention (Not really sure about this though) that you have to live for an X amount of years in the same commune, which falls back to zero if you move to another place. How logical is that?
