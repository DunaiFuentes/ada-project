SAP is a good topic to be in, especially in consultancy, but is also a broad topic, as it covers frontend development, project management, business partnering, backend development, architecture and usability (only joking, SAP have never cared about usability)).

Either way, lots of places will be interested in that, and I would imagine a junior in this area (again depending on the city, exact job profile from the ones above and more, and of course the company) with no corporate experience would probably be on between 70 and 90k plus benefits depending on company policy.
