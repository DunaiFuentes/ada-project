I am Swiss but did all the paperwork for my wife. It was not especially complicated compared to other countries.

The place, however, where the experience really differs is once you are IN Switzerland:

Renewing residency permit in France: 
- Make sure you remember when your permit expires

- Make double photocopies all documents in advance

- go to Préfecture, queue for an hour 

- get sent back to the end of the line because your documents are not sorted in the right order

- submit papers - you have to speak french for this

- your card expires and you have to go back and queue up again to get a notice stapled to it that you have a request for extension and can still stay/enter the country in the meantime (and boy is this fun to explain to customs officals in the middle east or asia)

- you finally get your permit, vive la france!

Renewing residency permit in Switzerland:

- get reminder in post: hey your card expires in 5 weeks, come by and renew it (admittedly this reminder is not especially polite, but that could just be my Gemeinde)

- go to Gemeinde with your passport and existing permit

- wait approx. 5 minutes in the queue

- gemeinde speaks english to you, makes all copies of documents themselves

- pay CHF 100

- get new permit in the mail 2 weeks later, 2 weeks before the onld one expires
