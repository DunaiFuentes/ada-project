null,null,Gwinntanamo,null,null,null,"As an American who lived in Switzerland for 8 years, I developed a hypothesis about this:
The Swiss value the right to take risks as they see fit - and do not tolerate governmental influence on what they see as a personal decision. For example, in the US, ski companies make it actually illegal to ski outside of the marked runs (piste). Lifeguards are hired for moat public swimming areas. And cigarette lighters are almost always 'child-proof'. And, if someone happens to hurt themselves skiing, swimming, smoking etc., unless all risks have been absolutely minimized, someone is getting sued.

But in Switzerland, you can ski almost anywhere you like - but you'll have to pay for rescue if you get hurt off-piste. You can swim almost anywhere you like, but there are no lifeguards so you better know how to swim. And child-proof lighters are non-existent, so be careful not to leave in reach of your children. If someone happens to get hurt - well, they probably took too much risk - they should learn from that.

Children are raised in these different environments - and they learn (or don't learn) to identify risk accordingly. A Swiss kid has learned that he needs to be careful if he's skiing off-piste - there may be cliffs that he can't see. So he skis carefully, and is prepared to hike back up the mountain if he finds a cliff in his way.

An American kid assumes that if nobody tells him he can't ski down a path - then he can do it without any danger.

So, the Swiss accept risk, and make decisions as they feel appropriate for themselves. So, they smoke cigarettes with the idea that it's a small risk now, and they can quit later. Americans have been taught that smoking cigarettes will kill you - so do not take the risk.

Anyway, that's my hypothesis about how the Swiss are comfortable with known risks. ",null,0,null,1438925857,null,null,false,0,ctuilc8,null,t3_3g3gry,null,null,null,t3_3g3gry,null,null,null,1440333271,null,50,null,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,50,null

Nowadays smoking is only allowed outside (like in the US), but even there the US has stricter laws: You can't smoke on the terrace of a restaurant in the US, even when you're technically not in a building. In Switzerland as long as they're outside they're smoking.

Also per capita more men go to the military in Switzerland than in the US. A lot of young men develop their smoking habit in the military. It's an atmosphere where you better not say 'no' and going with the flow is a quality that is desired there. Plus it's stressful and you have a lot of waiting periods.

I think this is what it boils down to, and while I agree with you regarding your ""risk"" theory I think your argument loses validity when we compare the rate/habits of drinking [alcohol] between Swiss and American youths. 

Under your theory the Swiss would adopt a similar attitude [to smoking] when it comes to drinking, but they don't. The drinking here is much more ""responsible"" and there is no culture of binge drinking (which to an extent is a byproduct of UK culture).

So once more it comes down to how smoking is perceived in both places. In the U.S its frowned upon and the rules are set to remind you that it's a danger to your health, a nuisance to others, and a nasty habit. 

Meanwhile, in the U.S you watch any football game and every 3rd commercial is about drinking beer, fast food and buying over the counter drugs. So one grows up with different attitudes about these things.

The problem with binge drinking in the US is more about the drinking age of 21. In Switzerland alcohol is introduced to children by their family (or at least while they are still living with their family). So they get specific education about drinking from their trusted educators. In America, we learn that alcohol is dangerous in any amount for anyone younger than 21. Then, once you are 21 (and not living with your family), the people 'teaching' you about alcohol is your other 21-year old friends... Yes, many people start drinking before 21, but they have to keep it secret from their parents, so they don't get to learn from more experienced adults...

Ok. You've lost me there. They do it more than smoking and if you grew up in the U.S, you know it's true.

Anyways...
It has little/nothing to do with the legal drinking age being 21 in the U.S, and you have to look no further than the U.K to see that it has more to do with culture than drinking laws.

The UK shares similar drinking age minimums as Switzerland, yet the drinking culture of the UK is more similar to that of the U.S. This is why I mentioned in my previous comment that it’s a byproduct of the U.S having been a British colony (and this applies to all other British colonies). We adopted their culture and attitudes towards drinking. 

So once more, it boils down to culture and attitude. The Swiss don’t glamorize or market a lifestyle of drinking. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Feldschlösschen t.v advert where scantily clad hot girls/guys are gathering around a pool partying to EDM. Likewise, I’ve never seen a big Swiss event (let’s say Fetes de Geneve) having a beer company as its main sponsor. But this happens all the time in the U.S /U.K. They are very open about their culture of drinking. 

Think of the iconic Beer commercials in the U.S.

Frogs going “Bud”-“Wei”-“Ser”… 

These are things an American kid grows up watching, but the Swiss don’t.

There’s no “pub” culture here. There’s no “beer-pong” culture here. Swiss musicians aren’t writing songs where the chorus is “Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots! EVERYYYYBODY” over and over.

American youth binge drinks because it’s part of the culture, not because it’s “illegal” to do so before 21.

Ok. Let’s not talk about “youth” (under 21). Swiss adults (22-30) still drinking “moderately”. American adults? Nope.

null,null,huazzy,null,null,null,"&gt;However these days more women smoke than men in Switzerland. I don't know why that is though.

Preface: This could be because I take public transportation much more than I did in the U.S, but I've found it rather alarming how frequently I've seen pregnant women smoking here in Switzerland.

At one point I politely asked if they should be doing that, and was politely told that their doctor told them it's better for the baby/mom to smoke and not be stressed than for her to be stressed from not being able to smoke.

Anyone else experience this?

It seems counter intuitive to everything I was taught about pregnancies. 

**Edit:** So I did a quick google search and maybe it's a French thing? (I live in Geneva).

It even has a quote that's very similar to the one the lady told me.

(From the article above)

&gt;She said that while her gynecologist had also warned her of the risks, he also warned her that being stressed and pregnant was a bad mix too, and that it would be ok for her to have ""a quick cigarette now and then"".",null,0,null,1438941306,null,null,1438950640,0,ctumup5,null,t3_3g3gry,null,null,null,t1_ctuk5xt,null,null,null,1440335344,null,1,null,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1,null

And let me say, comparing the two drinking cultures are nearly identical. My swiss friends get shit faced just as much as my american friends, and so do my french friends, and german and italian. 

Conversely, my american friends in their late 20s dont really get that drunk anymore. They drink socially, but a few beers, some nice whiskey, etc. And so do my european friends here.

I think the main disparity in the opinions of drinking culture comes from young professionals coming from the US. They grew up in the young 20s drinking culture, then graduated to a more ""mature"" drinking culture as they came to switzerland. So they see the more mature drinking culture in switzerland, and forget to look at what the young kids on langstrasse and hardbruke are doing (i'm in zurich).

Smoking is different. The main problem with smoking is that it gets addictive fast. It is very difficult to quite, once started. Also smoking starts as a social thing.
