There is a large expat presence in some places, so if you're looking for 'good food' and to socialise in English, then I can only suggest here.

Two good places to be with English speaking people:

* [The Shamrock \(Irish Pub\)](http://www.shamrock-luzern.ch/) 

* [Mr Pickwicks](http://www.pickwick.ch/mr-pickwick-pub-luzern/)

And somewhere I can't rep for personally, but my father swears by:

* [Legends AKA Billy's](http://www.legends-luzern.ch/)
