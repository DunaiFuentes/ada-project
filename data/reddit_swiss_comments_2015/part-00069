If you want to buy a car and you live in a major city, I would recommend a car like a VW Golf, Audi A3/S3, etc... Which will cost approximately 30-50k CHF used based on the condition and options.

Remember, parking in any major Swiss city sucks and you have to rent a parking spot or get a permit to park on the side of the road. 

 You can save some additional money if you buy a car imported from Germany but the resale value will also be lower.

You should come to Switzerland without a car and then decide if you need a car.
