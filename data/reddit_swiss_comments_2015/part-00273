Also, if this is at 2 TeV, then why wasn't it detected before, when the detector was running at 4 TeV ?  **Edit:** I made a mistake - I thought this was from the new data.  It's not - it's from the old data, so this **is** a discovery from the time it was running at 4 TeV.  The new data hasn't been checked yet?  Perhaps too little to use currently.  It's only been running for 2 weeks, verses years at 4TeV.

Finally, the article talks a lot about the problem of when you search for statistical 'bumps' in the data - that you'll always find bumps just due to randomness.  But isn't that completely solvable by just checking new data and seeing the bump is still there?  Don't we just need to wait a week or so and check with fresh data?  **Edit:** Answering myself again, the article makes much more sense if you consider that it was written based on years of 3.5TeV data and after the LHC had then been shutdown.

The advantage of this is that you throw the particles round the ring, and each time they pass through the same accelerating cavity you give them an extra kick.  They build up energy over time until you reach the desired energy, then start colliding.  The problem with this is that you need to bring the particles back around in a circle.  As you bend the path of the particles they radiate their precious energy away (synchrotron radiation).  Your maximum energy is achieved when the kick you give them on each orbit equals the amount of energy radiated in the same time.  There are two main factors that contribute to how quickly they radiate energy.  Firstly, the tighter the turn, the quicker they radiate, hence why the LHC takes 27km to bring them around.  Secondly the heavier the particle, the slower they radiate.  This is a very strong relation, meaning that if you were to put electrons into the LHC, you wouldn't achieve anywhere near the same beam energy.  There is a plan in the air to create a TeV scale lepton collider called TLEP.  This would be at the same complex as the LHC, and could accelerate electrons up to these energies, but it would have to be 100km long.

So the alternative is to build a linear accelerator, where you put the particles in at opposite ends and collide them in the middle.  This has the advantage of not having synchrotron losses, but the disadvantage of only using each accelerating cavity once.  This means that linear accelerators have to be very long.
