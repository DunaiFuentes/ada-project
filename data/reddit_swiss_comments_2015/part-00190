You haven't stated what degree you're getting, but even if it's something sought-after I think it's not easy to find English-only jobs for fresh graduates, although I guess it's not impossible since some people can do it. 

If you have money to sustain yourself and know someone who can help you translate bureaucratic stuff that needs to be done, and manage to find an apartment (not easy in some places but there's plenty of international people who manage to do it), it doesn't sound too difficult except on the psyche. 
The trouble is learning a language from scratch when you have no previous language-learning experience. 
Also the concept of full immersion is broken in German Switzerland because they'll all speak Alemannisch while you learn German in class, if you're not used to it at first it won't be easy to connect the dots and see the similarities. 
Asylees can do it, you can too. 
But you risk throwing away a bit too much time right when your career should begin if you can't find a job, which isn't too good.

&gt;

&gt;The __proton spin crisis__ (sometimes called the ""proton spin puzzle"") is a theoretical crisis precipitated by an experiment in 1987 which tried to determine the spin configuration of the [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton). The experiment was carried out by the [European Muon Collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Muon_Collaboration) (EMC). 

&gt;Physicists expected that the [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark) carry all the proton [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics\)). However, not only was the total proton spin carried by quarks far smaller than 100%, these results were consistent with almost zero proton spin being carried by quarks. This surprising and puzzling result was termed the ""proton spin crisis"".  The problem is still considered one of the important [unsolved problems in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsolved_problems_in_physics) [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*].

Ok so if you don't have a car you'll need to go by train mainly. I really recommend St. Cergue. It's a really nice little town in the Jura mountains between Geneva and Lausanne (if you know the region it's straight up from Nyon). Basically take the train from Lausanne to Nyon, and then a smaller train to St. Cergue. Up there you can visit the town, go eat at Rando Burger (this may literally be the best burger place in Switzerland and the owners are Swiss-American so they speak English if you need it), and the town is surrounded by miles and miles of mountain forests and pastures so you can hike for however long you want :)

If you do get a car I'd really recommend that you look up La Dole. It's one of the peaks of the Jura and if you look it up you'll see that there's a ball on top of it which you can see from down by the lake even. If you drive to the base of the mountain there's a really nice little refuge where you can eat and drink, and then you can hike up to that ball and back down in like an hour or so (it looks tough, but it's not too hard).",null,0,null,1432197013,null,0,1432197198,0,crg5smz,null,t3_36plqv,null,t1_crg5smz,null,t3_36plqv,null,null,null,1433184924,null,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2,null

For what is of trails, cars are not necessary most of the time, as the train/bus network is quite good. Obviously for some of the more remote ones you might need a car... You can look at the ""mobility car-sharing"" program if you have a driving license that is valid in Switzerland, but I think it can be quite expensive.

For nice trails I suggest you look around St. Cergue as said by /u/SwissBliss, or many other towns in Jura really. There are also some nice areas by Vevey and at the end of the lake near Valais.

There are also a few ""Parcours vita"" around lausanne which sometimes connect to hiking trails, you can find more information on their [website](https://www.zurichparcoursvita.ch/).",null,0,null,1432197829,null,0,false,0,crg5z1u,null,t3_36plqv,null,t1_crg5z1u,null,t3_36plqv,null,null,null,1433185008,null,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2,null

If we measure nature's performance in how good it's to survive/reproduce, being gay is quite bad. Then again, if it had such a negative impact on the survival of the human race (or any race for that matter, yes, gay animals do exist) we would see less gay people with each generation.
