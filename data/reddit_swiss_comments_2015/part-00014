Yes, most speak German. The dialects are quite different from High-German, but most written things (so letters, signs, menus in restaurants etc.) are written in High-German. Dialect will only help you to integrate better into society by speaking. All Swiss Germans speak High-German though, even though some of us might not like it so much.

&gt; How does the government of Switzerland work? Do these cantons make any difference over for example health care?

Health care insurances are private. Their prices are different in each canton, probably even in each city. We use [Comparis](https://en.comparis.ch/krankenkassen/default.aspx) to check which insurance is the cheapest in the location we live. The coverage is standardized nationally. Other than this I don't think there is any significant difference between the cantons when it comes to health care.

Healthcare is the same over all of Switzerland but the Cantons can have certain varying laws (e.g. time where you are allowed to sell alcohol is until 10 in Zurich but only until 9 in Geneva).
