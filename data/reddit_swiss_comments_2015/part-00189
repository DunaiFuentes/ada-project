If you want to come to Switzerland to work you first have to find a job. When you get a job, the employer will request a residency permit (B) for you. As a EU citizen you can come here for quite some time and look for a job, but you will only get a L permit. The L permit has lots of disadvantages, so housing, bank account, insurance etc. are really troublesome. With the B permit it's all easy.

This is my advice:

- Make sure you are at the FIRST viewing and send the form in immediately the same day if you are interested. This is the most important thing to do, as after the first viewing the agency normally has more than enough applications that they can immediately select a good candidate and coordinate with the owner.  Normally if they want to give you the flat they will ring you and confirm you are still interested, then send a contract in the mail. Only then will they charge you if you don't sign, so it is not a good idea to delay application in case something else comes though.

- Make sure you look good on paper: no debts, stable income, permanent residency or swiss citizenship for the person with the stable income, no musical instruments or pets etc. For debts, income, residency you should not lie but if you suddenly take up the trumpet after moving in... that's life, eh? ;)

The heaviest known particle is the top quark at 173 **G**eV, about 4% of this mass.

The 'big idea' of the LHC is to create exotic environments that normally don't exist in the universe, but at the same time are perfectly allowed by the laws of nature.

By creating these extreme situations, we are hacking the universe, understanding how it works, and writing down the laws so engineers can tinker with them and make cool applications.

My search in LHC data is for something called the Majorana Neutrino, and it is theorized to explain the smallness of Neutrino mass.  Simply, each of the 3 nearly massless neutrinos (tau, electron, muon) has a partner, a Majorana neutrino partner, which has extraordinary mass.

Using 2012 data (8 TeV collisions) we excluded its mass up to 500 GeV.  But many believe the Majorana Neutrino would have a mass closer to 1 **T**eV (1000 GeV), so we are eagerly waiting to analyze the data from these new collisions!  That is just one example of something the LHC is hoping to produce.

The remaining things are SUSY (dark matter), b-quark physics (anti-matter vs matter), exotic quark states (particles made of 4 quarks), and some other weird stuff.",null,0,null,1432142587,null,0,false,0,crfeg70,null,t3_36lqfz,null,t1_crfeg70,null,t1_crfb6yp,null,null,null,1433171755,null,4,false,CERN,t5_2r692,4,null
