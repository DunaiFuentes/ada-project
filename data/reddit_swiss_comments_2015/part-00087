CIA etc. are glorified in movies, but espionage remains illegal. I shouldn't have to remind it here btw (since that's the general theme with Snowden). I don't see how his heroic actions would credibly mean we forget his breaking our laws, on our soil, in our disfavor.

Honestly that just proves what a failure direct democracy is, especially when it comes Volksinitiativen. It's really time to get rid of them, they are clearly a problem. Sorry but doing something extreme (like accepting stupid initiatives) just to express your disagreement is teenager behavior and clearly shows that such people should not be allowed to vote. The constitution is not the right place to express discontent. Either we introduce some kind of minimum requirement for voting rights (e.g. you need to pass a test, likewise for car driving license) or even better we finally get rid of Volksinitiativen. They literally serve no purpose, I can't think of any useful Volksinitiative. It's all far right or far left wing populism that destabilize the country. And someone need to tell the Swiss that their democracy is shit. Seriously. The Swiss are so complacent and arrogant, I'm ashamed to be part of it. It's absurd how people think that more democracy is always better. It clearly isn't. And it's not even a very democratic country, a third of the population has absolutely no democratic rights as it takes an absurd amount of time, money and endless obstacles to get a citizenship and hence your basic rights. And this is all totally intentional.

null,false,hubraum,null,null,null,"I suppose we disagree here: I think Volksinitiatives are generally a good idea. Dumb voters are one of the biggest problem any democracy has IMHO. Usually (dumb) Volkinitiatives get denied BUT usually countered with a more sensible approach. IMHO this forces the parliament to do something about things they'd otherwise would not do anything or do something most of the people would not support.

Look at the countries around us. They are not any better. Look at Germany, dumb voters vote their popular candidate which then does bullshit for some time because voters have absolutely no way to influence the action. Then comes election time, so politicians make up promises to get (re-)elected but never fulfill them. I think the Volkinitiative are a way to keep a overreaching parliament in check - even if it means that sometimes a stupid initives get passed.

I mean, the democratic system is not perfect, not our variant, not the American or British variant. But it's the best thing we have right now.

Regarding the obstacles... Well it depends on where you are. Which is not optimal, agreed. Cost wise - I dunno? Are you refering to the fees? Which are less than CHF 1000 AFAIK?

null,false,leo_037,vd,VD,null,"okay, so I mostly wrote a hasty ""presumed guilty"" opinion (sorry), based on my previous knowledge that he:

* worked for the CIA in GE under a diplomatic cover: I don't know how automatically that amounts to committing espionage (CC art. 272) or maybe [unlawful activities on behalf of a foreign state (CC art. 271)](http://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19370083/index.html#a271) or something I'm not aware of)
* was somehow associated with the shady recruitment of a banker: turns out he seems to only be a witness to that (according to himself, which is debated by Ueli Maurer)... don't know either if being a witness to various CIA stuff in GE makes him prosecutable for not denouncing them.

so now I've found this:

&gt;By 2007, the CIA stationed him with diplomatic cover in Geneva, Switzerland. His responsibility for maintaining computer network security meant he had clearance to access a wide array of classified documents.

&gt;[...]

&gt;He described as formative an incident in which he claimed CIA operatives were attempting to recruit a Swiss banker to obtain secret banking information. Snowden said they achieved this by purposely getting the banker drunk and encouraging him to drive home in his car. When the banker was arrested for drunk driving, the undercover agent seeking to befriend him offered to help, and a bond was formed that led to successful recruitment.

&gt;However, the story of Snowden's escapades in Switzerland was mainly media hype, Maurer said. The Swiss Foreign Ministry has asked the U.S. embassy in Bern to check what really happened.

&gt;Maurer told another Swiss Sunday paper, NZZ am Sonntag, that it was up to the judicial authorities to decide whether or not to launch a criminal investigation into Snowden, but the Swiss cabinet would back such a move as a formality, he said.

1. maybe someone would like to look deeper into that
2. especially: I'm wondering if you can be known to have worked for the CIA, anywhere or even in CH, and then not be worried once you come back to CH... my point is: the CIA's activities are routinely glorified or maybe *banalized*, but isn't it an organization that no nation (even the US actually, I think by definition the CIA operates abroad) would allow to operate on its soil (unless they are doing something together)?",null,0,null,1425751654,null,0,false,0,cp7eh60,null,t3_2y5ten,null,t1_cp7eh60,null,t1_cp757m1,null,null,null,1427631148,null,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2,null
