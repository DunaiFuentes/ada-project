There's the idea in central banking economics that monetary policy has to be unanticipated to be effective because anticipated policy changes will have already been taken into account in economic behaviour and will therefore not evoke any further effect.

The same idea was used to hold the lower bound in the first place. If people anticipate the SNB to hold a lower bound of 1.2 no matter what, then they don't even try to buy/sell at a lower rate and the SNB doesn't have to do anything at all. Worked quite well this time.

More information and some empirical evidence showing that this idea might not hold always can be found [here](http://www.nber.org/papers/w0506).

&gt; Did anybody know this would happen?

Judging from the stock markets... No, seems like their all redoing their forecasts.

And this is great because the interest is already very low and thus rent is cheap. Furthermore, the negative interest rate for banks will let them give out mortgages more easily as they can't sit on too much cash. This will improve the economy as there is more money for investments.

But, and this is a big but, the export industry, which makes up a big portion of the Swiss economy will likely get hurt. Although they can import the materials much cheaper this won't help as the price for the resources needed are not a big part of the selling price. We have to see what comes out of this. I'm guessing there will be some sort of job loss which can't be in the interest of consumers who are generally profiting from this change.
