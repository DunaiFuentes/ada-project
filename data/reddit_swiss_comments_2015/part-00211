This is not correct. A January 2015 study by the International Service for Reminerations and Pensions (iSRP) of the OECD concluded that CERN offers the least favourable social conditions for staff in same-sex partnerships. What this means in practice is that CERN denies to same-sex registered partners expenses such as moving and travel expenses, installation and resettlement allowances and even pension payouts to surviving partners. All of these things are given to married couples.

Of course, more generally, Switzerland bans marriage and adoption for same-sex people.

Regarding the CERN LGBT club, it is denied official club status. As I understand it, this is because representatives of member states voted against it (what I've heard is that France and Italy voted against it, while the U.K. and Austria were supportive).

The LGBT club has had its posters torn down or defaced continuously for at least two years. The usual thing is posters being torn down soon after they are put up. Other occurrences are defacements (insults and whatnot scrawled on them), replacements (basically, Islamist literature appearing in place of the LGBT posters) and more threatening behaviour (a bunch of the posters were torn up and left outside the office of one of the members of the club).

CERN is made up of generally intelligent people, so LGBT people can be ok here socially, but CERN should be doing a hell of a lot more to protect its LGBT people, as should Switzerland. These discriminatory policies and laws are disgraceful.

&gt;Do you really think somebody cares to look at them?

Go and talk to members from Pakistan and Russia. It means a helluvalot to them.

&gt;I don't think your posters are stupid. You just OVERDO it! There is no other poster at CERN that is as widespread at CERN as you LBGT poster even though the people who might be interested in is a minority group.

When did you last see the LGBT posters? Is it possible that you saw just the IDAHO ones? That was a bit unusual because we wanted to cover lots of languages while also giving a bit of a 'fuck you' to those people continually tearing down the posters.

SIG. No, not SIG Sauer, not SIG Arms, just SIG. (S)chweizer (I)ndustrie (G)esellschaft or „Swiss Industry Company“ in English. Today they are called SAN „Swiss Arms Neuhausen“ and the only gun they still manufacture is the 55x and 75x Series of rifles and the SAN 511 precision rifle. God knows for how long they can continue to produce weapons in their small country of origin and when they cease to exist due to financial and political reasons. They probably need to close the production facilities pretty soon and move over to Germany and the US completely. Even though it would strike me hard as a patriotic Swiss firearm aficionado that SIG’s last root to it’s „home country“ would die off, it would probably be the right decision. Better stop now and let the legend of top notch Swiss craftsmanship live on in our heads than succumb to financial pressure and lower the quality of the firearms produced.

* Treaties are part of international law, and international law is at a higher level than constitutional law.

Again, there is no consensus on which of those is the correct view at the moment.

And then the particularities of the Swiss system add a third view that is probably undisputed:

* International treaties that are subject to a Federal referendum (Constitution, Art. 140 ff.) are comparable to constitutional or Federal law and therefore not subject to constitutional review.

This view is not directly relevant to the current discussion though, as the extradition treaty with the US does not fall under Art. 140 ff.
