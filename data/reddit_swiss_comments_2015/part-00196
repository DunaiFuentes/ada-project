null,false,CesarV,null,null,null,"Thanks again for all the great tips and feedback!  I was actually leaning towards the Green trail based on the small amount of research I have done, seems very scenic, and I like that it goes right through the heart of Switzerland.

I am very glad to hear there is limited asphalt hiking.  I hate hiking on asphalt!  I wish that trail guides and maps would do a better job of showing when hikers will be out in nature or just on a road for cars.  The aesthetic issues aside, there are also pragmatic issues for hikers.  I generally hike between 20-30km a day when I am backpacking, and have little or no issues doing this and even a bit longer if it is on a woodland trail.  My personal record in a day is 37km and only got a few small blisters, and was able to hike over 20km the next day no problem.  But hiking on asphalt hurts and cramps up my legs/hips/lower back, and I get more blisters too.  I can only hike about 10km before I start to feel pain and blisters begin on asphalt.

I grew up in the USA where it's illegal to camp in most places other than ""official"" campgrounds, but did quite a lot of stealth camping, so I know the routine ;).  I also don't usually make a fire, only on special occasions really.  It's easier to cook on a stove with your own fuel, and I prefer Esbit tablets for this, which are light and effective.  I am happy to hear there are lots of options for hostels.  I would probably try and do 50% stealth/campground under my tarp and 50% hostels.  The farmers can keep their cheese and meat, what I want is beer and wine!

Nice to hear that there are no problems with insects.  I would probably bring my head net just in case, but leave the bug spray at home.  I am fine with tough hiking and in fact love it.

And as far as light packs go, [here is my gear list from last summer] (http://www.geargrams.com/list?id=19035), and this summer it will probably be even lighter.  Is that light enough?  :D

I would probably take a bit warmer sleep system due to how high the Green trail is, so it would be cooler there at night.  I am planning for a July trip in a few years after I finish off some trails I am working on here in Sweden.

The gist of it is that you'll have to pay the social insurances for both the employer and the employee. The link above tells you exactly how much that is in percent of your income.

Taxes you pay in Switzerland (as far as the Swiss are concerned). If you earn below a certain threshold you shouldn't have to pay taxes in the US, but you'll still have to submit a tax return.

There's also the BVG (pension) you'll have to pay for. That however is yours to keep. If you leave Switzerland in a few years you can either leave the money in a special account (Freizügigkeitskonto) until you reach age 65 and get a monthly pension, or take the money with you (if you go live in a country outside of the EU).

You still need a work visa and I'm not sure how that works, but shouldn't be a problem if your wife has a work visa.

*edit:* Alternatively and if it makes sense you could also form your own GmbH (LLC) and invoice the US company. The bottom line is pretty similar to the ANOBAG approach, but you get more options in terms of tax optimization.

I'm not sure if there is a course available anywhere. In my opinion, the subject really is not complex enough to provide material for seperate lessons and one can easily find the relevant information in books. But maybe I am wrong about this.

However, this topic falls under the category of ""administrative law"" (fr: droit public, droit administratif; ger: Verwaltungsrecht, öffentliches Beschaffungswesen) and should be included in every general law book about public law with some notes to further literature. While I could recommend you some german titles, I'm really not knowledgeable on the french and italian literature concerning this question but maybe something like [this](http://www.schulthess.com/buchshop/detail/ISBN-9783719033767/Dubey-Jacques-Zufferey-Jean-Baptiste/Droit-administratif-g%E9n%E9ral) would be of some help to you.

If you have the chance to make your way to Switzerland, I recommend searching via [Nebis](http://www.nebis.ch/) and checking out the book in a library for free so you won't have to spend a fortune for only a chapter or two.

And as a last remark: [Simap.ch](https://www.simap.ch/shabforms/COMMON/application/applicationGrid.jsp) seems to be the place where the state and contractors exchange information, maybe you will find something there.

I took a look at your gear list, it looks like you go ultra-light. That's necessary for this type of hike so you should be OK with pack weight. For food, you can stock up on food items in the villages, so I usually only carried 1.5 days of food with me at all times (usually bread, local cheese, local meat and a few light packaged items). You'll pass [fresh water troughs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mtb_antz/4104500363/) about 2-4 times a day so just fill up when you pass by those (usually outside of farms and in the village centers). 

I think 50% stealth and 50% mountain hut would be a good compromise. I would recommend doing some personal research on which mountain huts you'd like to stay at. Generally, the designated 'SAC mountain huts' are in the most scenic areas. They always have beer/wine and hot food too (traditional swiss alp dishes). One that I particularly enjoyed was the  Blümlisalphütte SAC above kandersteg. I only stopped there for lunch and a beer, but I remember it was very nice. 

One other thing to look into, when you stay at mountain huts you should research what their accommodation restrictions are. For example, some huts will sell you a bed but others require that you also purchase a meal plan (which can be an additional 20-30CHF) which can run your total (bed + food) to the 50-80CHF range and it can get expensive. Of course, the food is wonderful but it can break your budget.

Also, the mountain huts are a ton of fun for socializing with other hikers. If anything its worth staying at them just to meet other people. 

Yes, it will be cold on the green trail so you will need a warm sleeping bag. Mine wasn't warm enough so I cold cold at night, but I couldn't afford a nice bag because I was on a shoe-string budget at the time.

http://bachelor.epfl.ch/admission-exam  
?
Try to get into CMS, (send them a mail), but I think you can be accepted from the US, (they are reducing the people who can be accepted, already many EU residence cannot).

Basically the admission exam (reduced) covers all the CMS material.
So calac, linear algebra, chem etc, as you can see on the site. It is not easy (unless you have good math background or good math skill). They even mention ""We strongly discourage students from taking the examination with only the baccalaureate or other secondary education as preparation.""
There are about 30 people who present to the exams, but around 4 or so pass. 


I went to a preparatory course, Ecole Du flon, was great, but around 14k chf, if you can afford it. 

They had all the material, and it was pretty clear that it was not easily available on the web. 

good luck, if you have more questions regarding the exam send me a message. (passed it a year ago).

null,false,SwissBliss,vd,Vaud/Valais,null,"Switzerland has 3 dominant cultures (German speaking, French speaking, Italian speaking) and 26 subcultures (cantons). In a perfect world you'd visit each canton, but that's impossible in 4 days. So I'd recommend you plan it around 3 main cities and then base your activities around them. Geneva for the french speaking side, Zurich for the german speaking, and Lugano for the italian speaking. The good thing about Switzerland is that if you drive/take the train between 2 major cities, you'll see a lot. Between Geneva and Zurich is Lausanne, Montreux, Berne, Basel, etc...

In terms of natural beauty, there's A LOT so it's hard to recommend only a few, and also Canada is quite similar in terms of nature as Switzerland, but here are a few I can think of right now::

- Zermatt and the Matterhorn is the most famous and breathtaking.

- Lauterbrunnen. Where Lord of the Rings was inspired from.

- Verzasca River in Ticino. Amazingly clear river with divers

- Jura Mountains. I'm a little biased since this is where I come from mainly. Basically it's the mountain range that gave the name to the Jurassic Period (and Jurassic Park :)). It's a mountain range that is low enough to be almost completely covered in forest and pastures, as opposed to the Alps. If you're near Geneva, I recommend going up to La Dole if you have a car, and eat/drink at the Chalet there, and then hike up to the Ball on the mountain (google a picture), which takes about half an hour each way and is fairly easy. If you don't have a car, take the train to St. Cergue and you can enjoy the small town (eat at Rando Burger, best burgers in Switzerland), and enjoy hiking/camping in the endless forests and pastures up there. 

- Sanetsch. Not much to it, it's just a passageway between two cantons in the Alps, but it's breathtaking up there.

Thing is that because of the location and natural shape of Switzerland, the climate changes quite radically in a short amount of time. In Geneva and Vaud it's very green and pretty humid due to the lake and mountains, in Valais (where Zermatt is) it's quite dry and warm with Vineyards everywhere, in Ticino (where Lugano is) it's hot enough for palm trees.
