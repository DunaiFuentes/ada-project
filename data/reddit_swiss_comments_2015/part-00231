The most useful website of switzerland: http://fahrplan.sbb.ch/bin/query.exe/en

Here you can find all the train, bus and boat schedules you need.


I have sledded the ""big pintenfritz"" and you are right, the information on the websites are poor. But here's one way to do it: In interlaken Ost (there are two train stations in this town!) you take the train to grindelwald (30 mins). If you arrive, you leave the train station to the left and walk up the village to the Firstbahn (10 mins, you could take the bus, it's like 2 stops). At the bottom of the teleferry (or anywhere else in grindelwald), there are sport rental shops where you can rent your sleds (if I remember correctly 15 chf each). At the teleferry, you pick a plan of the region, which will be very helpful to understand where you're going.
At the top, your hike starts - some nice 2.5h uphill to the Faulhorn (not the actual top with the restaurant, you'll recognise the start of the sledding track). From then the fun part starts. Depending on how much snow there is, you can sled down to the town or you have to change to the bus (there are plenty heading back to grindelwald) earlier on the route.
About shoes - pleas wear good, waterproof, high ones (no sneakers), and waterproof trousers. Don't forget gloves etc.. You will be hiking through snow, and even though they prepare the path there are some places you'll sink into it. Especially during the sledding part it will soak you with melting snow and I've seen quite a few tourists that weren't enjoying their trip at all because of their light clothing.
