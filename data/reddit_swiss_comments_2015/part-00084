If marijuana will be legalized, the police (esp. the drug enforcement subsidiary) will simply reallocate their force but definitely not reduce it. This is like believing in Samichlaus. They will start to crack down other drugs and illegal substances, harass peaceful people and making their life difficult. Prosecutors and courts will be as busy as they are now.

Even more if it will be taxed. This will create new legislation which has to be controlled and enforced by new or existing state/cantonal agencies. So for example, the current [raids of plantations](http://www.polizei-schweiz.ch/ger_scatt_247_1/Hanf%20Hanfplanzen.html) justified by drug prohibition laws, become raids justified by regulatory laws for marijuana production. Bravo!/S To me, it doesn't sound a lot of crime was reduced or tax money saved.

I'm absolutely not sure, why swiss press and people always glorify Colorado. Must be a smoke cloud or something.
[Looking at Colorado from a critical view](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/01/colorado-legal-marijuana-charts-statistics), from an initially estimated $100M in recreational tax earnings, they very quickly had to lower the estimate to $31M. At the end of the year the check balanced at $44M. This number will melt even more, when surrounding states also legalize the use of recreational marijuana, as 45% of the sales in CO are from out-of-state-customers.
And even with medical and recreational marijuana, guess [who is stepping in](http://www.cheatsheet.com//business/guess-why-colorados-attorney-general-isnt-sold-on-legal-marijuana.html) if the legal market can not fulfill the demand or prices are simply too high.

Yes, the marijuana business could be a peaceful venture, if the state and his paid goons, would not drive producers, sellers and consumers into illegality.
