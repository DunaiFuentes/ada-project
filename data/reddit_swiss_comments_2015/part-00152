Go there when there's an open work-shop and check out what you're interested in. And sign up for a lunch on Wednesdays and get to know people and their projects. It can become expensive (membership fee is 100.-) so think about that first.

So Italy is a dictatorship now? 

The constitution in any country is voted on by people. 
Why is doing this now wrong, but if it was done 50 years ago then it's totally correct and should be unchangeable in certain parts of it? 

For example, I love how the constitutional court in Italy stated that the government can't block the increase to match inflation only of state pensions above 90k€/year. Oh the wisdom of the ancients! And changing the constitution is so difficult that nobody can do it, unlike in Switzerland. 

Article 7 of the italian constitution is one of the fundamental principles, which cannot be changed. 
It says that the Lateran Treaty regulates the relations between Holy See and Italy. 
This pact was created and signed when Mussolini was in control. The church got financial support and in exchange supported him. 
Don't you think it would be better to be able to change this? 

Not to mention that this inflexiblity creates huge problems of interpretation and long constitutional debates which stifle much-needed change. 

Art. 11 says Italy refuses aggression war. It's not respected because it's not clear enough. 

Art. 5 says the country is indivisible. 
What if one days Europeans decided they wanted to form one big federation, but that certain current states are too big and would be an inefficient middleman?

Yes they are generally safe. So are trams &amp; trains.

Be a little bit street smart.. as you should be anywhere in the world. But you don't have to be worried about serious crime apart from drunk teenagers and such.
Note that after a certain time at night, you'll need to get an additional night-time fare. Also note that most public transport do not check if you have a valid ticket, so it is up to you to buy the correct one. If they catch you without a valid fare, it'll be costly.

&gt; Do they only accept cash?

I'm not sure actually since I've had a yearly pass for ages.
