null,false,t0t0zenerd,vd,Vaud,null,"&gt;I'm thinking of majoring in finance or commerce so is geneva good for that or should I go to Bern or Zurich instead?

**If you do commerce, HEC Lausanne is one of the top faculties in the French-speaking world** (only HEC Paris is better). So that'd be perfect for you. For finance, HEC Lausanne is still very good, but from what I've heard Zurich is pretty good too. Given your stated German level, I'd take Lausanne anyway

&gt;I'm currently 17 and living in france, I hold a french and american passports so normally I can live and work in Switzerland? Correct me if i'm wrong, but doesn't the schengen agreement let me do so?

Yes, and it's unlikely to change soon, especially for students. Around a third of the students at the big French-speaking Swiss universities (UNIL, EPFL, UniGE) is French, so that's not much of a problem.

&gt;I was thinking about going to Geneva or somewhere in the french speaking part of Switzerland because my german ist nicht gut. Considering i'm fluent in french and english that may give me a leg up in the job market as well, again correct me if i'm wrong.

Being English-speaking is obviously an advantage, and I'd like to somewhat nuance the view that we're all magically bilingual: speaking English will be a prerequisite rather than an argument in a service job, but in all other cases it'll help, especially since there are different categories of ""bilingual"" and you, being a US citizen, are probably much better in English, especially in pronounciation, than most of the ""bilingual"" people in this country

&gt;I've heard university is exceptional but expensive, is it possible for foreigners to get student loans?

Yes, there are a number of ways to get your university to help you with the housing and general living. The tuition is around €800 per semester, but it is rumoured to go up soon for foreign students.

&gt;Is the rent expensive in big cities? (I'm guessing it's on par with paris)

Emphatically **yes**. But there are more and more opportunities for relatively cheap student housing, particularly in Lausanne. Outside that though, we are indeed talking Paris-expensive or worse, and also nearly impossible to find regardless of the price.

&gt;Should I learn german or will french and english suffice?

If you live in Lausanne/Geneva, you don't need German as a student, though it might be a good idea to learn a bit of it depending on what you want your job to be (people in HEC usually end up being managers of some sort, and since Switzerland isn't very big they'll be required to talk to German speakers)

&gt;How long does it take to obtain a swiss citizenship and will I have to do military service if I do get one?

At least 12 years living here, which'd make you 30 at the earliest by the time you get it, so no need for going to the military. Most binationals don't do it anyway.

&gt;I hear people make good money there and the the taxes are low so this makes living there all the more interesting.

Yes. Throughout your student career, you will feel like Switzerland is an absolute rip-off because of the prices, which are usually 1.5x higher than in France, but the salaries are 2.5x higher and the taxes are lower, so once you're getting money it won't be too much of a problem anymore.

A French lecturer was talking in our uni about ""people we can call relatively rich, aka earning more than €3'000 a month"" and we kinda stared at him in disbelief and told him that'd be considered a low wage for a supermarket cashier.

&gt;Are people kind or rude in general and towards foreigners?

Wherever there is a university, people will be used to foreigners and will have no negative reaction to them. You'll get some ribbing, and don't bother showing your face if France ever loses in football to Switzerland (don't worry, it'll never happen), but no further. You'll hear people say how here is better than France a lot, though - small-country complex - so get used to it.

&gt;Are there any major differences in laws between the EU-15 and switzerland?

Of course there are, but on a day-to-day level there are no more differences than if you moved to the UK or Germany.

&gt;Will I be required to own a gun or is that reserved for citizens?

No-one is required to own a gun. You'll be allowed to though, but especially in Unis people will think you're a bit weird if you're too vocal an admirer of guns.

Sidenote: why is this getting downvoted so much?
