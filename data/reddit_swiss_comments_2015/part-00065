null,false,rosenjazz,null,null,null,"I am an American and I studied abroad at ETH Zürich from February to August 2014. I personally had the time of my life and would go back in a heartbeat. Breaking down your questions:
&gt; transportation around the city

Picking up a used bike is optional in my opinion. You would likely get a monthly tram pass for around CHF 60 that is good for unlimited tram rides during that period. Zurich is very small for a major city so it is easily walkable.
&gt;transportation to other countries

Depends on how far you want to go. In some cases it may be cheaper to fly from Basel Euroairport since it is a hub for Ryanair and Easyjet (super budget airlines that fly around Europe). Trains to other countries can get expensive so to help with this, as well as transportation around the country, I would definitely get the Halbtax/Gleis 7 card. It grants you half fare on all SBB rail service within Switzerland as well as discounts on some other modes of transport (occasionally gondolas). Additionally it allows you to ride FOR FREE between the hours of 7 PM - 5 AM. This is an unbelievably valuable deal as you can day trip somewhere, pay half price for the fare there, spend the day and then ride back for free, effectively quartering the cost of transportation from normal fare. It's ~CHF 300 up front but it pays for itself very quickly.
&gt; how bad the cost of living really is

There is no sugarcoating it, Switzerland is the most expensive country in the world to live in. You might do a double take when you see that a Whopper combo meal at Burger King is CHF 7,00. I was lucky in that ETH gave me a stipend to subsidize my rent at a WOKO (basically student housing but off campus) for CHF 495 / month. If you're thinking of studying at Universität Zürich, they have what are called Mensas, which are cafeterias with heavily subsidized meals that work out to CHF 7-10 depending on what you get. I cooked most of my own meals at home. Groceries are generally affordable and comparable in price to American grocery stores with some exceptions. Also Migros will often have a great takeaway section with relatively cheap, quality food if you don't feel like cooking. 
&gt; how the nightlife/social scene is for people my age

To be honest, not that great. Zürich is no Berlin when it comes to opportunities for youth nightlife. There are a few clubs around (Plaza and Hive come to mind) and some really great bars, all with the caveat of being really expensive. Most of my nightlife consisted of hanging out with my fellow international friends and having house parties or just chilling with some booze, if we weren't traveling somewhere. If you are looking to party every night, Zürich is not your city - but there are enough opportunities here that you won't feel completely starved if that is your thing. If you're going at the beginning of fall when it's still warm then Zürichers will still be having tons of barbecues out on the lake and around the city's beautiful parks and forests. With Zürich, think less raging parties, more chill.
&gt; the weather for that time of year (august-december)

I can't speak for beyond august but that month was wonderful. It's warm but not hot, enough to walk around in a tank top and shorts. There's plenty of sunlight for the most part. I would bet it starts getting colder late October. 

&gt;options for hiking/scenic/outdoor activities

Holy shit way too many. This is where Switzerland in my opinion beats out almost all other places in the world for having such amazing outdoor activities that are easily accessible by public transport. For the first couple of months you absolutely need to go hiking around Mount Rigi, Mount Pilatus, Zermatt, Lauterbrunnen and the Creux du Van (and many more I could name). Once it starts snowing a decent amount you should go skiing even if you're a beginner. I skiied at Davos, Arosa/Lenzerheide and Zermatt and had some of the best runs of my life, and I have skiied in Colorado and Utah. There's nothing like a perfect powder day in bright sunlight at 3000 meters.
&gt; the swiss' friendliness towards Americans

All the Swiss people I met were generally very friendly. Compared to Americans or Australians they are more reserved, and generally have well-established Swiss friend groups. However one thing that will absolutely help you in breaking the ice is if you decide to try learning Swiss German. Everyone will be willing to help you as I think language is one of the biggest barriers of intimacy between the Swiss and other nationalities. Regular German is good too although many Swiss people prefer not to use it when possible. Practically everyone I met spoke English so you won't have trouble communicating. Even after those 6 months I made one truly good Swiss friend, and she is one of the nicest, funnest and most caring people I've ever met. However I made a ton of international friends since the two big universities in Zürich (ETH and UZH) have a large contingent of international students who study there from all over the world. 

I could keep talking about Switzerland forever so definitely PM me if you want to know more about my experience and advice on stuff to do. Again, I personally loved my time there and wouldn't trade it for anything else.
