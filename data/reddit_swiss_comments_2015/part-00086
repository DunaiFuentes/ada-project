wwz is good too, but just in the metropolitan areas it's almost the same logic to follow here.

swisscom is not always a good bet, there is many places where swisscom will have the worst performance, especially in older buildings or smaller towns.
Cable is going to beat them there 100 to 1, you can input your adress on the swisscom site and they tell you what speeds you can get.

Of course, the situation in Switzerland is a special one since we have diglossia (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diglossia). Thus dialects are not negatively looked on as it is the case in Germany for instance.

If we wanted ""Swiss German"" to become an own language, there would be several steps to be taken:

- selection: choose one dialect
- codification: process of standardization (it needs a regognized grammar, a dictionary and a standard pronunciation)
- elaboration (language policy, language status)
- acceptance by those who will speak it (basically the most important step)

However, there is another possibility. Instead of choosing one dialect, you can also create an artificial one (cf. Romansh ins Switzerland).
