True. ""forces"" was too strong; rather, direct democracy incites citizens that have an opinion to participate.

&gt; I think that any other (less direct) system can do that, too, and in that case political discussion become of a sharade.

Also true, but the system we have know gives a cheap and convenient way for parties to advertise their views in everybody's letterboxes. With all due respect, this strategy is IMHO an abuse of a political mechanism that was intended to be the absolute last resort to a political issue by amending the constitution. 

Just look at today's votations: the CVP wanted to remind everyone that they support families, and the GLP thought it was a good idea to give themselves an identity ahead of the federal elections later this year. The wording of both initiatives was either sloppy or overly radical, no wonder almost nobody voted for them.

Are you implying it is something negative? I'm not sure. The truth of the matter is that almost all conflicts are not black and white, but shades of grey.

Take the current Ukraine conflict. Look at how both sides can throw around the morality stick. West: ""You have attacked a sovereign nation. Blabla."", Russia: ""We must help our kin in the Ukraine."". Now go back 20 years and see how NATO attacked Serbia, another sovereign nation. West: ""We must protect the people in danger there by bombing Serbia."". Same in Afghanistan. Russia attacks Afghanistan, the West provides the Mujaheddin with weaponry and training. Fast forward, the West attacks the Mujaheddin which are now Taliban and AlQaida. Nato to Russia a few years back: We will not extend towards your territory. Fast forward to present day, half of the ex USSR states are now NATO.
A few years ago, PKK was and basically still is seen as a terrorist organisation. Now Germany is providing the PKK with weapons against ISIS. WTF? This goes on and on and on. It's the same as with unreported money.. Everybody talks about ""fair"" and blabla, but it's basically a pile of shit where everybody pisses on everybody else while leaving their own tax havens alone. It's the same with dictators' money. Half of these have been instated by western intelligence to avoid having the native people assume a less ""pro west"" stance. Then the mood changes and they're suddenly the worst dictators. Look at what happened in Iran. It all seems forgotten and we basically see Iran as a terrorist state. WTF.
