In my field getting your foot in the door is tough. Internships and experience matter very much. I was able to get my masters with good grades from one of the top universities in europe (blowing all my savings and having to take a bank loan in the process thanks to the lack of student loans for masters) but then I had to move back to my parents house in the countryside, many hours and many euros of travel away from anywhere with jobs remotely related to my field. 

Even affording to go to job interviews was tough let alone being able to live somewhere for months. My parents aren't poor-poor but they are very solidly working class, they can afford to feed me when I'm at home but they can't be paying for both their mortgage and somewhere for me to live (especially in London where most jobs in my area are...). What's worse is you can't even get unemployment benefits if you're doing an internship or otherwise trying to improve your employability, which is ridiculous.

There needs to be legislation to enforce payment of interns. They can't be restricted purely to the wealthy and those lucky enough to live near them.
Switzerland though IMO tends to be pretty good for this. They've quite a solid internship system linked into the school system. Interns at my company earn some pretty nice money for 18 year old kids.
