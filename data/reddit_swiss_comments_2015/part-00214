*Disclaimer: I am a student, not an employee; everything contained in this post is my best attempt at describing facts, but it is not legal advice; if you want to be 100% sure about something, ask the EPFL student services or legal services.*

This is probably the ""weirdest"" degree at EPFL for historical reasons.  
There are three ways to do it:

* **90 credits**  
60 credits of courses including at least 15 in the ""mandatory"" courses list from the study plan, at least one 7-credit mandatory course, 2x3 credits in ""SHS"" (human and social sciences) that must be taken in consecutive fall then spring semesters, and one 12-credit project.  
Then, 30 credits for the thesis.  
Also, you must do an internship either during the summer (&gt;= 8 weeks) or during a semester, which might be combined with the thesis if you find a professor and a company willing to do so.

* **120 credits with a minor**  
Same as the 90-credit one, plus 30 credits of courses from a [minor](http://sac.epfl.ch/minors) at any other EPFL faculty.

* **120 credits with a specialization**  
Same as the 90-credit one, but you must take 90 credits in CS courses, at least 30 of which are in one specialization. (note that you can double-dip, e.g. ""Foundation of Software"" counts for 4 mandatory credits *and* for 4 credits in either the B or H specializations)  
The odd thing about this option is that since you would've taken most classes in a specialization anyway (since you're probably interested in at least one of the subjects), it ends up being ""take 30 credits outside of the specialization so that you can validate the 30 credits you took in a specialization"", which is probably not the intended effect.

In practice, most people pick a masters with specialization (the ""no specialization, no minor"" one feels like a discounted degree..), and either take 3 semesters with 30 credits each, or 4 semesters with ~23 credits each.
One important factor is the semester project (the 12-credit one) you pick: depending on the person you're doing it with (can be any professor / PhD student in the IC faculty, or even other professors), it ranges from ""not much work needed, write a small report that probably won't be read"" to ""do a ton of work, meet twice a week with the prof, write a long report that will be read in full"". You can also do an optional semester project for 8 credits, and the same remark applies. Doing 30 credits including the 12-credit project might burn you out if the project requires too much work.

Foreign student might be allowed to take some classes EPFL students get during their Bachelor; some of them are even prerequisites for Masters classes if you didn't take an equivalent class in your home university, such as Compiler Construction, Software Engineering and Operating Systems.

If you come from the US, you might be shocked at the number of classes; yes, taking 5 or 6 classes per semester is perfectly normal.",null,0,null,1433605192,null,0,false,0,crxkt9i,null,t3_389qcd,null,t1_crxkt9i,null,t1_crxkiz0,null,null,null,1437568677,null,1,false,EPFL,t5_2svyx,1,null
