You might want to check out [http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6464](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6464) which highlights the error in Ralston's paper in the first appendix. They also introduce an improved framework for characterising the spin and parity of the new boson which has been used in more recent analyses. In [http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3441](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3441) by CMS they consider all combinations of spin-1 states. The updated ATLAS analysis does not test spin-1 however. 

Its worth pointing out that the improved analysis of 1306.6464 does agree at LO with the JHU code used to generate the spin-1 hypothesis used in the older spin-parity analyses by ATLAS, so their testing of the spin-1 states is still consistent with the later results.
