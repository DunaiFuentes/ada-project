""Credit score"" is not really so relevant here, as long as it does not involve the official path, which is a ""Betreibung"" which you'd receive from your local Betreibungsamt.

Tell them you're in the process of getting this rectified and that you never received a Betreibung or anything of the sort (if that's accurate). Ask them what they'd like you to provide to remediate this situation. I assume they want to do business, so they should be able to tell you how to make it happen...
