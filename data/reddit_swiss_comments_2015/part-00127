How expensive is it ? Fees, accommodation, food etc.

Is a mechanical engineering degree from ETH better than similar degrees from other schools ?

The FCC is but one proposal. There are currently 3 other major e+e- collider proposals on the tables - CLIC, ILC and CEPC. All four of these would have Higgs-factory functionality, to investigate the 125GeV Higgs using electron-positron collisions which, due to their fundamental nature, have cleaner interaction signals than proton-proton. These proposals are almost competing at the moment, and which is chosen will depend on what the new high energy LHC finds.

CEPC (Circular Electron Positron Collider) is another circular collider (similar to LHC &amp;amp; FCC) proposed by the Chinese, designed to reach a centre of mass of 250GeV in a ~70km tunnel

ILC &amp;amp; CLIC are linear colliders, and there's a whole swathe of pros and cons for linear vs circular Colliders - my group studies report on Uni I did a couple of weeks ago was on just that. 

ILC (International Linear Collider) is a ""conventional ""linear accelerator, using tried and tested RF cavities to reach its maximum 1Tev C.O.M energy in a distance of 31km. If I remember correctly the ILC proposal is currently planned to be built in Japan.

CLIC (Compact Linear Collider) is a CERN-based design project, using a newer method of particle acceleration, a drive beam. Effectively a beam consisting of a larger number of lower energy electrons transfers it's energy to another beam with less particles and therefore higher energy - one person I've spoke to before used the analogy of like a transformer. CLIC aims to reach a 3TeV C.O.M energy in a distance of 48km - whilst this length is longer than the ILC, it is compact for the energies to be achieved due to its drive beam technology.
