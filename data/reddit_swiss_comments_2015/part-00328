null,null,whitepalms85,null,null,null,"&gt; That depends on you as a foreigner, how you act and what you do. 

I'm not a foreigner, it's funny how people assume that. And it's just as much the responsibility of a country to allow integration then it is the task of the foreigners. The Swiss make it harder than most other country to integrate, on political, legal but mainly cultural level. Honestly, I know a lot of foreigner who tried and simply gave up because there is not point in trying with the Swiss. What can you do as a German if a major share of the Swiss simply hates you for your nationality? And you can't even complain because then you will get blamed even more and most Swiss are okay with bashing Germans anyway. And no, this isn't just about the Germans.

That the Swiss blame the foreigners for not integrating pretty much proves all my point. It's exactly that xenophobia, arrogance and complacency I'm talking about. The Swiss would never admit that they are part of the problem. So let's blame the foreigners.

&gt; I mean, I really doubt anyone would treat a foreigner in a xenophobic way if that foreigner joined a yodeling club and invited everyone for fondue. 

No offense, but that is a right wing fantasy and simply not true. How do you even get in contact with a Swiss person that is in such a club? Even if you start talking to a stranger in a bar you get strange looks and reactions in Switzerland. Also, a lot of those clubs are dominated by ultra conservatives, so how much fun is it as a foreigner to spend your evening listening to some xenophobic view (and occupationally they might say something like ""but of course you are different"" to make it not too awkward)? 

&gt; Language is also huge. Many expats don't even bother because it's not required for their jobs. 

I agree that people should learn the language but good luck with that in Switzerland! We don't even speak German and you can't really learn Swiss German as it isn't really a language with grammar and everything. Basically you would have to learn German and the slowly transform into Swiss German. Also, again, the Swiss are super hostile towards other people trying to speak their language. People are even complaining if Germans try to say Grüezi. Yeah, very motivating if you get bashed for trying but not being perfect at speaking some weird pseudo language...

&gt; ""Look at that arrogant Zürcher"", but in the end it's not an honest statement.

It is, if you are from Zurich you get shitty treatment in the rest of Switzerland all the time. Basically you first have to take their shit and then, maybe, if you are extra nice to them despite their hostility then they actually change their mind. It's exactly that xenophobic culture I am talking about. 

&gt; Like I said, it depends on you.

No, it doesn't. If you even have a Swiss passport and you still aren't accepted then there clearly it's Switzerland that is to blame for it. It's absurd to think that it's always the fault of the foreigners. How is it your fault that you parents were from former Yugoslavia?

&gt; But nobody would ever know because of the way I was brought up. 

That confirms my point too. It's absurd to think that people basically need to become ultra Swiss to get accepted. I'm Swiss and I'm not like that either. There is nothing wrong with have foreign roots and you don't have to change into some kind of countryside SVP voter. Basically your argument is that if you don't become just like some ultra Swiss nationalist you aren't welcome. That's pretty xenophobic. It just means that you're hostile toward anything that isn't exactly like you.

&gt; It's a Swiss mindset that your roots are always there (in Switzerland or not), and you shouldn't forget about them, but at the same time, you have to devote yourself to your current place of residence.

Isn't this simply another way to describe a xenophobic culture?

&gt; Also, five years is NOTHING. You cannot expect to be called Swiss and have a passport thrown at you after that time.

That's totally normal in the UK and most countries have faster and easier process for citizenship. It's deeply undemocratic to refuse people their political rights for no reason. Even someone that does everything at trying to integrate doesn't get any better treatment.

&gt; And it is possible to integrate and learn the language within that period of time if one is devoted. 

I lived in London for a few year and I was more integrated than in Zurich (and I'm Swiss). Also it's very easy to learn a language in five year, maybe unless it's Swiss German and that's certainly not to fault of the foreigners (and not an official language).

&gt; It is by far not standard in any country for foreigners to have any democratic rights. 

That's another Swiss fantasy. E.g. if you pay local tax in the UK you get local voting rights. That simple. That's what democracy is about, not that Swiss pseudo-democratic system were so many people have no political rights even after a decade.

&gt; Earth citizenship

I never said that. My point was that people that behave, pay taxes and speak the language should get citizenship. I'm not saying we should hand out passports to everyone or so. But all that Switzerland does is make it more difficult for everyone so that far right winger can say that the rate of foreigners is very high.

&gt; you pay taxes, behave well, etc. Then what is the problem, why don't you just become Swiss? Shouldn't be a problem if you've lived here long enough and been an upstanding citizen.

That you have to wait over a decade? Then some random people will have to vote on you after you went so bizarre, ridiculous procedure. 

&gt; What's wrong with that though?

That's a topic for itself but this article was about why expats don't like the Swiss culture and clearly that's a reason for it.

&gt; doing the exact same thing, just from the other side

I'm politically center right, so quite far from a left winger.

&gt; It just makes the people who are already angry at you even more angry because it makes you seem like a needy little piece of shit.

lol, that's just absurd. So those angry people can be xenophobic and I'm not allowed to say anything?! Again, exactly proofs my point. Racism/xenophobia is such a big taboo in Switzerland. Honestly, fuck those ""angry people"".

&gt; but you have to understand how the Swiss mind works. Change is slow.

Switzerland has slowly change into becoming more and more nationalistic, xenophobic and arrogant. The SVP has done a prefect job at making hostility toward foreigners a legit thing. Just go to a foreign country and show the people the SVP campaign ads. Again, neither my friends nor I are left wingers and everyone I ever showed a SVP ads instantly agreed that it's obviously racism/xenophobia and got this slightly disgusted look on their faces when they hear that this is the biggest party in this country and totally legit. I mean how surprising is it that expats don't like Swiss culture when a major part of the population is obsessed with hating them?

&gt;  it still depends on you. How you act, etc. For most people, the xenophobia is just a first, small barrier that needs to be broken, after that, you're perfectly fine. 

Okay, this becomes kind of repetitive but clearly it's not the job of a foreigner to overcome the xenophobia of the Swiss. Again, not very surprising that expats don't like a culture that works like that. 

&gt; There are wonderful stories of the most xenophobic farmers somewhere in the middle of nowhere becoming best friends with a black dude. 

Again, this is what I mean with Switzerland being such a fucked up culture. The xenophobic farmer should be ashamed, instead it is romanticized. 

&gt;  But damn is it easy to put the blame on us Swiss people.

What?! Nobody EVER does that. Basically in Switzerland you're not allowed to say that.

To expand on what u/dukwon has said:  

A **fill** number changes anytime new beams are injected into the LHC.  Fills usually last for 8-12 hours; sometimes longer if a piece of the accelerator complex (e.g. SPS) is unavailable to inject particles into the LHC.

For CMS specifically a **run** is also known as a period of data collection.  Whenever the central data acquisition system in the CMS control room configures the detector to record data we call it a run.  There are hundreds of thousands of ""CMS runs"" in the LHC Run I.  

Within a run data is then broken down by **luminosity section** called lumi section for short (a set period of time, I believe it is ~40ms? Someone can correct me if I am wrong).  Within a lumi section then data is broken down by **event number**.  However, each event number is just when the trigger system makes the decision to record and readout a particular collision.  In that event number there could be multiple collisions recorded (indeed this is true when the instantaneous luminosity of the beams are very high, i.e. many collisions occur within a ~25ns time window).  However physicists are only interested in the collisions within that grouping that caused the detector to record data.

So to access a collision of interest in CMS you ask for, in order, the Run, Lumi section, Event Number.

In addition for detector alignment purposes we also take **comiscs** for other reasons.  These include calibration periods.  They also are a good time to test new firmware/software additions to the central data acquisition system.
