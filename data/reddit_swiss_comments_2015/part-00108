Day 1: [Wengen - Grindelwald](http://map.wanderland.ch/?layers=Wanderland,Wanderwegnetz&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;scale=100000&amp;X=641299.8067925&amp;Y=161116.342366&amp;trackId=1998281&amp;lang=en). All day long you'll walk in front of Eiger, Mönch, Jungfrau.

Day 2: [Grindelwald - Meiringen](http://map.wanderland.ch/?layers=Wanderland,Wanderwegnetz&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;scale=200000&amp;X=651579.2299325&amp;Y=169579.2074675&amp;trackId=1998285&amp;lang=en). Do the Grosse Scheidegg pass and visit the Reichenbach Falls where Sherlock Holmes died.

Day 3: You can walk from Meringen to Engelberg in one day, but it's pretty demanding - it's 31km. Of course you could take a cable car. Alternatively [just go up to Melchsee-Frutt](http://map.wanderland.ch/?layers=Wanderland,Wanderwegnetz&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;scale=100000&amp;X=660811.2075&amp;Y=178006.7804275&amp;trackId=1998399&amp;lang=en).

Day 4: [Melchsee Frutt - Engelberg](http://map.wanderland.ch/?layers=Wanderland,Wanderwegnetz&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;scale=100000&amp;X=668478.833053&amp;Y=183189.861474&amp;trackId=1998400&amp;lang=en). This is a popular walk as you pass different nice lakes. 

Day 5: [Engelberg - Niederrickenbach](http://map.wanderland.ch/?layers=Wanderland,Wanderwegnetz&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;scale=100000&amp;X=679605.2206245&amp;Y=200188.460625&amp;trackId=1998439&amp;lang=en). The first part is another popular walk (""Walenpfad"") but go fruther until Niederrickenbach which basically is a convent, a couple of farm houses and a hotel. After 9 o'clock you won't here a noise.

Day 6: [Niederrickenbach - Rütli](http://map.wanderland.ch/?layers=Wanderland,Wanderwegnetz&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;scale=100000&amp;X=679605.2206245&amp;Y=200188.460625&amp;trackId=1998439&amp;lang=de). Get ready for some Swiss history: The destination is the place where Switzerland was ""founded"" in 1291. Just be aware: there are no hotels there so make sure you the the last boat (yeah, there is no train or bus station)

Day 7: [Gersau - Rigi](http://map.wanderland.ch/?layers=Wanderland,Wanderwegnetz&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;scale=100000&amp;X=681236.339353&amp;Y=208655.059094&amp;trackId=1998459&amp;lang=en). Pass the Lake by train and start going up to Mt. Rigi from Gersau (alternatively Vitznau or Weggis, it doesn't really matter).


I don't know about your physical condition. This route is pretty demanding but doable. Also: If you get tired on some of those walks you can take a cable car. But it is totally worth it, these are some of Switzerland's most popular walks. Just be aware: Due to snow and weather conditions, it's probably best to wait till June to start hiking.",null,0,null,1427112258,null,0,false,0,cpnuno8,null,t3_2zss7k,null,t1_cpnuno8,null,t3_2zss7k,null,null,null,1431963382,null,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1,null
