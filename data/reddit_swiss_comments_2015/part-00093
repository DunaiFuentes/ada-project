Bigger towns are a bit more foreigner-friendly, though is is of course a generalization. Small places can be quite provincial, either you mesh with the community and will probably be forever known as ""The Lithuanian"" or nobody will say anything to you except and awkward and accented  ""hello"" and ""Sank you"".
