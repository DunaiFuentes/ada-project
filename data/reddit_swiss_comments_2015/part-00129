This [page](https://www.ethz.ch/en/studies/prospective-masters-degree-students/masters-degree-programmes.html) contains a lot of information about general stuff, such as cost of living and so on. Tuition is with 644CHF a small amount, living and food will make up most of your costs. Plus stuff like health insurance and so on but you can find most of the info on that page. There are cheap-ish rooms that are subsidized by ETH that you might be able to get, they have a dorm kind of feeling (like 4+ people in an apartment sharing kitchen/bathroom kind of thing).

The classes in general are very much on the theoretical side. Depending on the focus you choose, there might be certain classes that you can pick that do have more hands on components. Additionally, you'll have to do a semester project which you have lots of options to actually make something and one third of the master studies are the master thesis which again is a huge project that offers lots of possibilities. This is all assuming you do a general mechanical engineering degree. There are specialized programs (such as robotics or nuclear energy) that usually have special rules. They also have a limited number of spots and sometimes are hard to get into (robotics has something like 40 spots for a couple of hundred applications).

ETH has an excellent reputation. In the academic world it will help you to have a degree from here. International rankings set ETH as best in continental europe and internationally the best non-US and non-UK university. If you want to work in switzerland it will also help you a lot. I'm not very sure how the situation is in the rest of the world. While the quality is really good, it might not be  known all over the world when it comes to jobs.

The atmosphere is really good in my opinion. However, most people are swiss and as I've heard from many exchange/foreign students, it's really hard to make swiss friends. I'm very open about meeting people from abroad but that doesn't seem to be the norm so most foreigners are friends with other foreigners. I'm not sure how things are in iceland but people here very often like to keep to themselves and if you have a different mentality that might come off as rude or even hostile. I always say, it's hard to break the ice with swiss people, it's kind of easy to make acquaintances and it's very hard to make real friends but if you make a swiss friend, you very often make them for life.

Point 3 of the proposed reform: Does that mean we're going to vote twice?

Won't enemies of a referendum vote 'no' on the second vote anyway, even when the 'people's will' has been implemented as good as it gets?

Also what happens when the second vote fails? Back to the drawing board I assume and another vote on the second draft. etc. etc.? When does it end and isn't that just delaying things more and more?

I like point 4 that would introduce the 'Gesetzesinitiative' on the national level. It's a cool idea and would give more control to the public while avoiding a bloated constitution. Also I don't like my constitution to having to mention minarets and cervelas (I actually am not sure if cervelas are mentioned in the constitution).. use laws for the details.

Point 5 is interesting, but I wonder.. wouldn't that introduce even more delays and maybe even more voting dates? I think it's possible to get informed on all the measures in time today anyway.

&gt;[...] The reforms, which could be implemented individually or cumulatively, should help restore the role of the right to political self determination.

&gt;1. Checking a referendum proposal by the Federal Chancellery before initiators start collecting signatures [...]
&gt;2. [...] the hurdle should be raised from the current 100,000 signatures to 210,000 (equivalent to 4 per cent of the electorate).
&gt;3. [...] Introducing an obligatory referendum on the enacting legislation would eliminate [...] shenanigans as voters would invariably have the last say. Any concerns about «respecting the popular will» would be eliminated.
&gt;4. [...] constitutionally valid proposals should be allowed to be introduced directly as legislation. [...] The signatures of 2 per cent of voters should suffice [...] 105,000 signatures would be roughly the same as for (Constitutional) referendums today.
&gt;5. Only one measure per voting day [...]

&gt;The proposed reforms do not mean any limitation to direct democracy, but greater focus and differentiation. They are based on the principle that voters’ and other actors’ understanding of the binding nature of this instrument will increase their sense of responsibility in using it.

again, it may delay things (and/or add voting dates), compared to a situation without the restriction, but if the other reforms are implemented, the whole system may be quicker overall/have as many/less voting dates overall.

&gt;I think it's possible to get informed on all the measures in time today anyway.

do you mean for every voter? I would disagree. actually I also think it's not just a question of time, but also a question of focus (*how many at once*, seems obvious to me that many people lack the ability to focus on more than one vote at once).

I don't know if I would call it 'having a say'. To me it seems like there are still ways to put in road blocks after the fact. But maybe that's the goal of this anyway. I can see a lot of scenarios where a vote causes the losers to become more interested to block the decision and if the winners aren't careful and motivated the second time their vote can still be reversed by the sore losers. Also I doubt that the second (or third or fourth) time around there will be a lot of people showing up to vote, which is unfortunate, but clearly these votes will be valued less by the people.

Well, I think that's probably true. Since you also change the hurdle for how many signatures are needed, there might not even be that many more times a year where we'd have to vote.
