&gt; Though four fundamental forces - the strong force, the weak force, the electromagnetic force and gravity - have been well documented and confirmed in experiments over the years, CERN announced today the first unequivocal evidence for the Force.

&gt; Kenobi&amp;#039;s seminal paper &amp;quot;May the Force be with EU&amp;quot; - a strong argument that his experiment should be built in Europe - persuaded the CERN Council to finance the installation of dozens of new R2 units for the CERN data centre*.

&gt; With the research ongoing, many at CERN are already predicting that the Force will awaken later this year.

Well most of us built jack shit. We're just very lucky to be born in such a great place.

There are many stances between uncontrolled immigration and fully blocking all immigration which the far rights seems to aim for. Especially since Switzerland always was quite a hard place to immigrate to.

&gt; and there are proofs that many wealthy societies fell under uncontrolled immigration.

I've always hear such claims but I can't think of an example in recent (or not so recent) history. Do you know of some?

I mean of course there has to be some limitation on immigration and asylum. But it's nowhere as bad as the SVP tries to claim. Especially stupid initiatives such as the Minaret ban are solving nothing and only creating more problem by their open hate for Muslims in general.

Well the SVP is the strongest party at the moment, so they are hardly a loud minority. But of course it also doesn't mean that everyone who votes for them supports the most extreme position of some party member.

While Switzerland generally has some xenophobic tendencies it's not the obvious racism. We don't have people on the street attacking foreigner, neither physically nor verbally. And as you said the police itself is hardly showing racism. Especially if you compare to the US for example.

But what I've mentioned myself quite a lot is that a lot of people really like to generalize a lot and make bad ""jokes"" about Jugos, Albaner, etc. And while it's not racism we of course also have the ever so popular hate/fear of Islam.
