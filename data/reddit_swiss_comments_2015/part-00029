First of all: I think your plan to work as a truck driver here is very realistic. Just know that driving here is very different to driving in the US, especially with a large vehicle. The roads can be pretty narrow and it happens every once in a while that trucks driven by people who aren't locals get stuck in a tiny dead end street because their navigation system led them astray. But overall, I think this is very possible.

Language: Since you won't need to go to school here or need to write much, I'd concentrate very much on learning Swiss German. Of course you'll need a certain level of the written language as well but I'd advise you not to neglect learning ""dialect"". People act very differently towards you if you speak Swiss German.

Which brings us to Racism, which is quite frankly often used as a buzzword. I dare say hardly anybody in Switzerland is racist (meaning that they actually believe people of color to be inferior because of their ""race""). People can be xenophobic though, especially on the countryside where there aren't many foreigners, save black people. As others have mentioned, many have the stereotype of the black north african asylum seeker drug dealer in their heads. To avoid being branded that way in their minds, take care of how you dress and carry yourself. I don't know your style, but it makes a giant difference. Dress well, maybe even a bit too formally I'd say. This would go a long way, IMHO. But in the end, you might have some bad encounters but overall I think you're not going to have too many problems. As soon as they would realize that you're from the US, I doubt anybody would have any xenophobic thoughts. Some people are just afraid of change and immigration is a part of that.

Best of luck to you and let us know how it goes!",null,0,null,1422030839,null,0,1422035384,0,cnyephx,null,t3_2tcuup,null,t1_cnyephx,null,t3_2tcuup,null,null,null,1424436666,null,10,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,10,null

Generally politically incorrect towards everything but mostly in a joking manner, very easy going (I'm German so it was very weird for me to a) realize that yes, we Germans are stupidly organized and b) it also somehow works without too much organization), tough negotiators (they really are tradesmen by nature) and there is an amazing international community in Amsterdam.
