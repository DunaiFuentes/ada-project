Including all of the data taken by the CMS and LHCb experiments at 7 and 8 TeV in 2011 and 2012 respectively, the joint observation of a B_s decay to two muons has a significance of 6.2 σ, while the probability of a B_s to decay to two muons is measured to be approximately 2.8 parts per billion.

Measuring this value has taken 25 years! The importance of this decay is that, since the Standard Model predicts its value so precisely, any deviation from that value might be the indication of some new physics as it were. However, it would appear that the Standard Model is spot-on once again.

There's some details about this in the [LHCb article](http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb-public/Welcome.html#LHCbCMS) and the [CMS public statement from 2013](http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/very-rare-decay-has-been-seen-cms), with explanations, history and outlook.
