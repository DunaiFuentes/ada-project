So authentic that Chinese tourists actually eat there. At least, it's not a restaurant serving a mix of thai-vietnamese dishes and owned by a Cambodgian or Swiss owner. It's a real Chinese restaurant and it's very rare in Vaud. 

I discovered it thanks to Chinese students in my master degree and got sad how much it reminded of my last time in China. I felt there and was shocked when I went out to find myself in Lausanne. :(

I am actually able to improve my decaying chinese vocabulary in this restaurant. I found out that explaining directly what I want to eat in chinese is a good way to get price reductions and free dishes. A good reason to continue to learn the language. 

Otherwise, you can order in english.

A trick : Waitresses and waiters from this restaurant become polite and very friendly (almost promiscuous) if you speak their language (simply the basics) or are a regular customer.

Ok I will help you. Next time, you will visit, try a few sentences or simply Ni hao.

Personally, I fell in love with this restaurant because, unlike many very expensive restaurants in the thread, it's still affordable for students or middle-income foreigners and the food really tastes like what I ate in China.
