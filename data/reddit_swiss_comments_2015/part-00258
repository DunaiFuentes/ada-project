EPFL http://master.epfl.ch/page-94489-en.html

There are English only masters but not for everything.

Scholarships are generally granted by the cantons but i don't think they are awarded to foreigners (unless your parents live here and you have a C permit). Differs from canton to canton though.
The universities themselfs also award scholarships but they don't hand them out like candy and you need to already be enroled to be eligable/ apply for one. E.g. here is the epfl policy http://sae.epfl.ch/epfl-grants and http://sae.epfl.ch/grants-foreign-students the others should have similar policies.

Some universities/ master-courses offer fellowships but competition will be stiff.

As for your being Bulgarian, as far as i know, immigration restrictions for your country fall next year, so getting a visa then should be easier i think. In my experience the higher the education the lower the prejudice, so you should be ok at uni. As  for employers, considering you will have a degree from oxford (or a swiss university if you go through with this), there shouldn't be any problems.
