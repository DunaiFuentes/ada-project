now this policeman... he scares me a little. he just seems unable to calm down and get professional once the situation is under control. yelling over and over again at someone who is cuffed on the ground just to vent your anger seems very unhealthy in general, but even moreso for a policeman. just imagine how he would handle himself under real,  life-threatening pressure. the answer is he would not be able to handle himself at all and any number of bad things might happen.


of course he is full of adrenaline after this highspeed chase and all that, but this is just an explanation, no excuse. you just cannot act in this aggressive manner as an uniformed official in public. 


i am sure he already realised this, at least after he sees how people react to his display. hopefully he will be removed from streetduty or maybe gets some lessons how to handle himself better in this kind of situations.

I disagree. Yes arrests do sometimes need the use of force to subdue a person. But punches aren't useful for that goal. Police officers should be trained to conduct arrests while they use appropriate use of force.

Regarding the language, it's unfortunate and I'd wish for our police officers to be above that but I understand that some angry words may come out in such extreme situations.

let me stop you right there. 

The rest of what you said only makes sense if you assume that serving in the army is somehow more valuable (in what way?) than civil service. In wartime, when you are actually and actively risking your life, I'd agree. But because there is no wartime, and because men today have the choice between the two as well, equality would be to have women serve the same amount of days in either civil service or the army. And if they were ""unfit"" for military duty, then it would only be because

1. There is a certain physical difference, yes. Not impossible for most woman to handle though. Certainly not for ""almost all of them"".

2. An army as an institution in it's current form is based on centuries of men and only men coming up with how it works. It's not anyone's fault that that might prove incompatible, but certainly not the women's.

The reason why I got pissed off is that you seem to like to belittle women and their ability to serve. Look, I'm all for equality and I strongly believe that women should fo their part as well, but as long as women still earn less than men and have other similar issues to deal with, I don't think we men have any right to complain.

null,false,DeepBlueNemesis,bs,Beide Basel,null,"&gt; I disagree. Yes arrests do sometimes need the use of force to subdue a person. But punches aren't useful for that goal. Police officers should be trained to conduct arrests while they use appropriate use of force.

They are called ""Schockschläge"" and are actually a part of police training. Unlike punches that a boxer throws, they are not meant to injure/knock out but to distract. 

Getting someone to put their hands behind their back when they do not want to and are actively blocking you / pulling their arms close to their body is very hard to do. There are no magic pressure points you can press and no super-secret techniques where you can easily overpower someone. Try it with a friend, he's on his stomach and has his arms to his chest and you try to get both behind his back. It's almost impossible unless the difference in raw strength is ridiculous - and even then it isn't easy. And that's all without having to worry about your friend suddenly turning around and hitting you or kicking you in the dick. Or pulling a knife. Or worse. All things the cops have to account for in those situations. 

So that's why the cops sometimes throw those distracting punches. Their aim is to hurt (not injure!) and temporarily distract the other guy, so he's losing focus for a short time and you can pull his arms, or he's moving his arms up to his face / crotch / flanks to protect them, thus allowing easier access for the police to apply some techniques without having to engage in a battle of raw strength. 

I'm not saying that punching is always appropriate, or that every punch a cop throws is a ""Schockschlag"" (there are plenty of reasons for a cop to box someone and it'd be justified) but in this case it's what they are supposed to do because it's actually less harmful than the alternatives (because engaging in a battle of strength could easily result in ruptured tendons, strained muscles and other injuries beyond some simple bruises). We can't see what the cop did exactly so I can't tell you what he did.

The cop's language is unfortunate, but if you read the [youtube comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4kttOAJeQjg#t=700) you can see that it's heavily implied that the guy is known to the police, so in addition to the adrenaline and anger there could also be a deal of frustration fueling the outbrust. I'm not saying it's okay, but it's far from a reason to remove the cop from street duty (seriously wtf) or even particularily worriesome. It should be talked through, yes, but I don't think it's a big deal. The dude asked for it, he got what he deserved and is now trying the classic appeal to the ""Kuscheljustiz"" in saying ""I'm the victim in all of this! Have mercy!"".

All punches do is hurt people. It doesn't hinder their movement which is the most important part of an arrest. The only exception would be if you punch them into the stomach or knock them out. And both options are way over the top and generally not needed for a professional officer. Not to mention dangerous.

The police is not there to give someone what they deserve. That's not their job and should never be it.

Their job is to arrest people breaking the law with appropriate force and nothing more. If that was the case in this case is up for people to decide who know more about this than we redditors.

They're feelings should have a little impact on this as possible and certainly not leading to hurting someone more than it's needed to arrest him.

Excessive force is another subject, though it is sometimes hard to judge the exact amount of force required when you are actually partaking in the action and wrestling with a dude. Also you have to realize that ""how it looks"" is usually different from ""what it is"", a cop has a priority list when engaging in physical combat and ""Style points"" are very low on that list.

It actually does. More precisely, it makes them predictable, which you can exploit with training. 

Example 1: If you punch/kick someone in the genitals, they usually hunch over and press their thighs together. If you expect this you can grab them by the neck and pull, throwing them onto the ground. 

Example 2: If you throw a punch at the head your opponent usually blocks (pulls their arm up) and sometimes even takes a step back or to the side. A cop can use that moment to take a step back and use that brief moment of respite to reach for their pepper spray or draw the baton. 

What I'm trying to say is that there are techniques to subdue people, but real life is vastly different from the training room and you can't just answer violence with ancient chinese techniques of pressing a pain point or similar things. Especially since the police have to deal with a lot of drunks and drug addicts - and those people don't feel pain anymore, so you'd just break their bones because they resist beyond what is reasonable due to the lack of feedback from their body (aka pain).
