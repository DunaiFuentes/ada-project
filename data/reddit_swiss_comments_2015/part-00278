There are 3 topics that are a lot more important than language abilities before you relocate:

- tax status (lump sum taxation/ordinary taxation)
- residence permit
- real estate

All 3 topics are interconnected. 

Depending on your personal situation (wealth, worldwide income, interest to continue working, standard of living, days p.a. you want to spend in Switzerland etc.) finding answers for these 3 questions can be very difficult. Furthermore, especially tax laws vary a lot in every canton (e.g. Not all cantons offer lump sum taxation) and municipality. Therefore, I strongly suggest to budget in some money for good legal advice from an expert (they take about chf 500 per hour).

I know it is difficult to understand if one is from elsewhere, but in the US, it is part of the culture.  Our love for guns is often mistaken for the same love of guns that one from a place like Switzerland would have.  

If in the US you love guns, you're just an American, and that behavior is part of the norm.  Because we grow up around guns in fairly large numbers from a high percentage of the population, there is nothing unusual about liking guns or owning them.  But for a place like Switzerland, where guns are not a major part of the culture, the type of person who would go against the ingrained culture and love guns is probably a nut.

Also, a large part of US culture is that we are a country founded because of a hate for powerful government.  As such, we tend to have a very strong reaction to the notion of having any particular liberty taken from us.  In recent decades, our federal government has become increasingly powerful and indifferent to the Constitution, which is essentially a sacred document here.  In response, certain citizens like to exercise some of those rights just because they can.

Also, in the US, especially on the eastern half, there is a clear delineation between northern and southern culture.  Those in the north are called Yankees, and are largely not the type to be a part of gun culture.  Those in the south are called Southerners and are the ones who are most likely to partake in gun culture.  So, although I'm aware that those outside the US tend to call all of us ""yanks"", we specifically only refer to northerners as Yankees.
