How is that such a problem? Your genes wont just change if you are transgender and people are also registered in order to be able to fight crime thus the registered sex should be the sex that can be found in your genome. If it's too offensive to write *male* or *female* on an ID then there must be found an alternative e.g. instead using the Allosomes (the gender defining chromosomes) XX and XY to indicate of which genome a person is.

&gt;With the church losing power and higher education becoming more common, however, Swiss society has recently been seeing some progress in that respect.

I don't think that's part of the problem. Most of the conservative people I know (xenophobe, SVP friendly) surprisingly had no problems with lgbt, they seem to accept those quite well. I think the problem is that first off there is no big lbgt-rights movement that has publicity and manages to do much in Switzerland and that most people just don't care  enough to discuss it a lot. 

&gt;it will need a lot of patience to see it through, but it will be done eventually.

I can only agree with that.

All in all I think (like many others here) that saying Switzerland is very backwards in relations to the lgbt community is an overstatement. there's truth in it but it's not factual correct and this statement:

&gt;So far the only conclusive and correct answer, and it's being downvoted because it doesn't portray Switzerland as perfect.

That's plain stupid and just as ignorant as hating lgbt.",null,0,null,1421170402,null,0,false,0,cnnq1o6,null,t3_2s6c4m,null,t1_cnnq1o6,null,t1_cnmsdc3,null,null,null,1424898891,null,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3,null
