Lucerne and the central part of Switzerland is definitly worth a visit. You should ""invest"" a day on Lake Lucerne and visit the Rütli. You should also go up to Mount Rigi and maybe got to Engelberg or Einsiedeln. It all is beautiful. I mean, they call it the heart of Switzerland, it's where it all began. You know, Wilhelm Tell and stuff. (Of course, much of it is more folklore than history, but still.)

On the other hand I always say: If I had to write a list with the most beautiful things in Switzerland, I would completly forget about the ""Drei-Seen-Land""/""Pays des Trois-Lacs"" (the region of Neuchatel, Biel-Bienne, Yverdon...). But whenever I am there, its beauty completly stuns me. It is not the typical alpine region that comes to your mind if you think about Switzerland. There are mountains (and the Creux du Vant is beautiful and a great hike), but there are also the lakes, beautiful villages and vinaries. Here, in one village people speak French, in the other, they speak German. Hell, go to Biel-Bienne and people speak both.

As a discussion system (with replies and voting etc.) he suggested the Reddit commenting system (which honestly was a bit different back then) and since I haven't heard about Reddit yet, I went and checked it out. (Also I know /u/toupeira is an admin on [politnetz.ch](http://www.politnetz.ch/) but I think it didn't exist back then or we just didn't know about it.)

Anyway, I dabble in gaming subs, a couple of subs from TV shows and the generally popular subs. It's usually about funny things like /r/DadReflexes or /r/holdmyfries etc.  
More serious topics I'm interested in is /r/soylent, /r/travel and /r/bicycle. I'm mostly a lurker and a sometimes commentator. I almost never provide content.

So far I've had nothing but pleasant experiences with the consulate in SF. I did manage to lose some paperwork in the mail, but I'm chalking that up (embarrassingly) to it being the first time I'd sent mail in several years. In person, it's quite fast, convenient almost (if you consider traveling 1000 miles convenient). 

I'm actually heading back down again in a week to go through the passport paperwork. All you need is an American passport, swiss citizenship, and ~$150!

This is an incredible opportunity we've been afforded. Being a Swiss means not only the right to work in Switzerland but an easy way to get a job in other European countries as well. 

Some information I wish someone had told me: 1) taxes. Like almost every country *but the US*, there's no tax on foreign earned income. Job in the US? Suisse don't care! 2) passports. Easy to look up, but nice to know -- 10 years, valid to tons of places, good identity/work document in pretty much all of Europe. $140 I believe? You do an appointment with your local consulate, where they do biometric data gathering. As far as I know this means photo and fingerprint. Can't do this remotely. After that, they ship it from Switzerland in a few weeks.

Out of curiosity, do you have any plans for your new citizenship? Parlez-vous français ? Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
