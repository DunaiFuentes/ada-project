No special recommendation about tourism stuffs. Salève is nice for the view I guess but I haven't been there for more than a decade. Weather should be nice tomorrow so it should be the perfect day.

About the SIM card look for Lycamobile, you should get it anywhere but not sure you can activate it on the same day, you should ask. The sim is free and you can buy 1Gb of 4G data for 5.90CHF valid 30days, however you will probably need to charge 10 or 20CHF in the first place, you have to check.

About public transports there is nothing as far as I know because when you go to an hotel you have a free public transport card for your whole trip, of course you don't get it with Airbnb. You should just get a day pass for city center in the morning of each day, it is quite cheap. However it will not be valid for your trip to Salève because it's outside the city center.

You can PM me if you have specific question, I'll try to help.

That's not what democracy is about. Voting is just one part of democracy. You don't have to vote on everything just to be democratic.

No, it's not, kind of confirms that you don't understand any other systems.

Yes, obviously not tourists or people that have only been here for a short period of time. But it's totally undemocratic to not let people vote that have been living here for years, pay taxes, behave... The Swiss are intentionally discriminating foreigners, it's deeply undemocratic.

Open carry is definitely NOT the norm here. People riding bikes with the stgw is not a common sight and you only really see it during the Feldschiessen or the mandatory shooting days.

You need to have a real reason to be carrying a gun (as a member of the army), i.e. going to the army, coming home from the army, having your gun inspected and with a order for the annual mandatory shooting. You should always have a document that states why you are carrying your gun around with you.

You need to have a legitimate reason to own a gun to be issued a license. Collecting is considered a valid reason, though I imagine the definition of what qualifies as collectible will be fairly strict. 

To get a license you must pass a full background test, which includes mental health as well as criminal, and domestic violence. Your license will also be revoked at any time if your ""qualifications"" change. You also have to re-apply and re-qualify every 5 years as far as I know. 

Open carry is technically allowed if you have a valid license. But outside of army or law enforcement personnel this is not done. At least I have not seen any private person openly carrying a gun in public (outside of hunters. Ever. If you choose to open carry for idealistic reasons (I.e in public spaces in civilian clothes) I would prepare to be stopped and questioned by police frequently. 

Concealed carry is only allowed by explicit permit, which is only issued if you can proof a genuine need and tangible danger. You must submit mental health reports, pass criminal background checks and pass a police exam in firearm law and gunsafety.

Your best bet to get the info you need about permits is to contact the Kantonspolizei (Cantonal Police) of the canton you are moving to.

In order to take your guns to Switzerland you would need to contact a gun shop and ask them to handle the paperwork for you, by paying a fee of course. This is the easiest way to do it, since there is no import restrictions when it comes to guns **but** in your case you do have certain restricted items.

Either way, it would work like acquiring a gun in Switzerland normally (for the normal items). 

Another problem that I'm seeing, is that if you are moving to Switzerland and you don't get the permanent residential permit, it will be quite hard for you to own guns and take them with you. I would wait at least 5 years until you get the C permit.

Your special items are the only problem that I'm seeing.

&gt;20x138

Is this a Lahti that you own? I've never seen these guns for sale in Switzerland, although .50BMG is widely available and you can get guns that shoot that caliber very easily, it would all be a matter of asking the authorities if that rifle is allowed. I would assume that it is allowed, but I really never seen rifles in those calibers for sale.

&gt;pre-1986 automatics

Another problem. Although it would have been fairly easy to buy these guns in Switzerland if you already lived here, it will be a hassle to take them with you.

Automatic weapons are only allowed with a special permit and they usually only give you this permit if you are fairly known to the police as a gun collector or if you already have owned guns in Switzerland for several years without any problems.

Do you own semi auto converted rifles that used to be FA? Those are considered to be FA by the police unless you can show a document from the factory that made the gun saying that it is semi auto.

&gt;suppressors

Suppressors are restricted in Switzerland **but** are easier to get than FA guns. Could be possible to take them with you by asking the gun shop to fill out the paperwork for you.

&gt;SBR

There are no SBR/SBS laws in Switzerland. These would just be considered normal rifles according to the Swiss law. So I don't see any problems there.

&gt;Also, is that true they don't give concealed carry permit to retired old guys like myself (only given for security jobs I've heard)?

Getting a CC permit is **almost** impossible without a really good reason. You can pass the test in order to apply to the CC permit, but only 5 out of 100 people that pass the test actually get the license to carry a gun. It all depends on your job.

&gt;But most of all, could you confirm that at least open carry is the norm (here too, heard of people on bikes with Sig550s on the sling, but no official word on it)?

I don't like to call it ""open carry"". I like to call it open transportation of guns. 

I also do openly transport my guns when I go to the range, but that's about it. You cannot take detours with those guns and you cannot carry them loaded or ammo inside the magazines. It is although possible to carry ammo in clips inside your pocket, but there's really no reason to do it since I've been in Switzerland for 28 years and I've never once saw any situation where I could have used a gun.

The thing about your issue is that you will need to apply for a permit for some of your guns (semi-auto, handguns, pump-action guns and lever action guns). The gun shop will help you, and if you have no criminal records you will be able to easily get the permit since it's ""shall issue"". All it takes is a clean background check, psychological problems are not really checked since they cannot ask your doctor about your problems, but they might check any records of you having been in a mental asylum or something similar.

Another thing that I failed to mention:

If you expect Switzerland to have the same mentality towards guns as the USA, you will see that it's not really the case. Even our sports shooting events are based in high standards of accuracy, you will not find someone that will go to a gun club and shoot blast shit with his SIG 550. Our official ranges are highly regulated and very professional, you might find a suitable range to ""blast shit up"" with your guns but those are rare and are spread throughout Switzerland.

You can certainly keep a gun for home defense if you want, but the liability will be on you if something happens with the gun.

Not really illegal. It's just restricted, but you can still own them by filling out a Ausnahmebewilligung.

&gt;You need to have a legitimate reason to own a gun to be issued a license. Collecting is considered a valid reason, though I imagine the definition of what qualifies as collectible will be fairly strict. 

Not really. You don't need a reason unless you are owning a gun for anything other than hunting, collecting and sports.

&gt;To get a license you must pass a full background test, which includes mental health as well as criminal, and domestic violence. Your license will also be revoked at any time if your ""qualifications"" change. You also have to re-apply and re-qualify every 5 years as far as I know. 

License for what? To own guns? Not at all. You don't need to requalify or re-apply for anything. There's not even any license, there's only a paper called WES that allows you to buy guns, not to own them since there's nothing needed to actually own and keep the guns.

&gt;Open carry is technically allowed if you have a valid license. But outside of army or law enforcement personnel this is not done. At least I have not seen any private person openly carrying a gun in public (outside of hunters. Ever. If you choose to open carry for idealistic reasons (I.e in public spaces in civilian clothes) I would prepare to be stopped and questioned by police frequently. 

""Open carry"" is only allowed if going from A to B with a good excuse such as going to the range.

And regarding alcohol: Given the negative effect it has on people's health and society (there is really a strong correlation between alcohol consumption and violence), I'm in favor of a stricter regulation and taxes (which - I know - is very unpopular in Switzerland where they even want to subsidize strong alcohols that are produced locally).
