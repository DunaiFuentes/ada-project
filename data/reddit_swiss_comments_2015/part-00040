    On a un bien joli canton:
    Des veaux, des vaches, des moutons,
    Du chamois, du brochet, du cygne,
    Des lacs, des vergers, des forêts,
    Même un glacier aux Diablerets;
    Du tabac, du blé, de la vigne.
    Mais jaloux, un bon Genevois
    M’a dit, d’un petit air narquois:
    «Permettez qu’on vous interroge:
    Où sont vos fleuves, franchement?»
    Il oubliait tout simplement La Venoge!

    Un fleuve? En tout cas c’est de l’eau
    Qui coule à joli niveau.
    Bien sûr, c’est pas le fleuve Jaune,
    Mais c’est à nous, c’est tout vaudois,
    Tandis que ces bons Genevois
    N’ont qu’un tout petit bout du Rhône.
    C’est comme: «Il est à nous le Rhin!»
    Ce chant d’un peuple souverain.
    C’est tout faux! Car le Rhin déloge.
    Il file en France, aux Pays-Bas,
    Tandis qu’elle, elle reste là, La Venoge!

    Faut un rude effort, entre nous,
    Pour la suivre de bout en bout
    Tout de suite on se décourage.
    Car au lieu de prendre au plus court,
    Elle fait de puissants détours,
    Loin des pintes, loin des villages.
    Elle se plaît à traînasser,
    A se gonfler, à s’élancer
    Capricieuse comme une horloge.
    Elle offre même à ses badauds
    Des visions de Colorado, La Venoge!

    En plus modeste, évidemment.
    Elle offre aussi des coins charmants,
    Des replats pour le pique-nique.
    Et puis, la voilà tout d’un coup
    Qui se met à faire des remous
    Comme une folle entre deux criques.
    Rapport aux truites qu’un pêcheur
    Guette, attentif, dans la chaleur,
    D’un oeil noir comme un oeil de doge.
    Elle court avec des frissons,
    Ça la chatouille, ces poissons, La Venoge!

    Elle est née au pied du Jura,
    Mais en passant par La Sarraz,
    Elle a su, battant la campagne,
    Qu’un rien de plus, cré nom de sort!
    Elle était sur le versant nord :
    Grand départ pour les Allemagnes!
    Elle a compris! Elle a eu peur,
    Quand elle a vu l’Orbe sa soeur,
    – Elle était aux premières loges –
    Filer tout droit par Yverdon
    Vers Olten ! elle a dit: pardon ! La Venoge!
     
    Le Nord, c’est un peu froid pour moi:
    J’aime mieux mon soleil vaudois
    Et puis, entre nous, «je fréquente!»
    La voilà qui prend son élan
    En se tortillant joliment.
    Elle n’a qu’à suivre la pente.
    Mais la route est longue, elle a chaud.
    Quand elle arrive, elle est en eau
    – Face au pays des Allobroges –
    Pour se fondre amoureusement
    Entre les bras du bleu Léman, La Venoge!

    Pour conclure, il est évident
    Qu’elle est vaudoise cent pour cent.
    Tranquille et pas bien décidée,
    Elle tient le juste milieu,
    Elle dit: «Qui ne peut ne peut!»
    Mais elle fait à son idée.
    Et certains, mettant dans leur vin
    De l’eau, elle regrette bien
    – C’est, ma foi, tout à son éloge –
    Que ce bon vieux canton de Vaud
    N’ait pas mis du vin dans son eau,...

    ... La Venoge!
