Because of changes in Swiss policy, all of these world-class musicians' visas are NOT to be renewed (they have been extended only to 31 August 2015).

There are so many online petitions out there without a real purpose, but this petition is an official one, sponsored by politicians from all of Switzerland's political parties. Please take a stand for music and culture with other musicians and friends around the world, and sign this petition to support the future of music!

Here is world-famous countertenor, Andreas Scholl, asking for your support of this petition (YouTube video): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpvoDQvB7K8&amp;feature=em-share_video_user

This is an official petition to the parliament, so please SIGN and SHARE this petition with your contacts by 25 January 2015! We need your help to get this petition to as many people as possible by email, Facebook and Twitter!

I found [this](http://www.srf.ch/news/regional/basel-baselland/auslaendische-musiker-in-basel-nicht-mehr-willkommen) article (in German) about this and apparently 55 musicians seem to be affected, maybe less depending what happened between October and today.

The petition seems to target two goals: A temporary extension of the musicians residency permit and a long term effort to make the music scene exempt from strict immigration laws.

I think I've read before that musicians sometimes run into problems with various immigration laws all over the place, but also some countries have special visas for musicians that allow them to work and live how this rather special industry demands.

Stricter immigration laws clearly seem to affect industries more that are unusual and are more dependent on foreigners: So extremely specialized ones. Yet I'm pretty sure that the people that voted in the past for stricter immigrations wanted to target a different kind of foreigner.

I hope Basel is able to keep fostering its reputation as a cultural hub and that we're able to improve our immigration policies in a clever and productive way.

If the total amount exceeds CHF 62, then you pay customs, VAT and a handling fee, the handling fee varies, depending on the carrier, CHF 20 or more. There can be an additional postal charge as some carriers (Swiss post) will use COD for the customs fee, costing an additional CHF 15.

The swiss post has a nice example (CHF 57 fees on a CHF 233 valued import):
