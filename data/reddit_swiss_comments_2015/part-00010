You have yet no reasons not to be able to work/study in Switzerland (except maybe heavy criminal record), you'll just have to get the proper permit.


The university is quite cheap, but as a foreigner you would have to pay about.. 30% more. In Fribourg for a semester you pay 655 as a national, and 805 as a foreigner. For the loans I'm pretty sure you would need either assets or a local that takes responsability for anything more than a few thousands.

German is often asked in most jobs, a bit less around Geneva maybe, but you can take classes to learn it just about everywhere. In Fribourg, you can get a bilingual paper which gives you a certain avantage on the market if you have a B2 or better level in German.

For commerce most universities are pretty good, and you have quite a few Hautes Ecoles de Commerces (same level as university, but more specialized) around that are quite good, too. Finance might require going to Lausanne or Geneva though.

The rent is quite expensive, especially in Geneva and to a smaller degree in Lausanne. To save some money, go for a campus place (well in advance) or try smaller cities (Fribourg or Neuchâtel).

Again, german is very sought after everywhere, but maybe less in Geneva. You should consider getting a B2 or C1 paper if you want to work here.

The swiss citizenship is quite hard to get these days, I think you have to live here for like 10 years before being eligible. But the french one should be enough for everything. The US one might give you problems with the banks though, I'd consider asking all the banks if they have a problem before that. I think Postfinance and Raiffeisen are ok with it still. You might consider abandoning it when they start asking you for taxes, anyway ;)
The military service won't be a problem, worst case just leave the citizenship for after 30. They won't bother you then.

The salaries are quite good, but the living costs are quite high too. I know a few people who go shopping in France because of the high difference. Do consider buying a subscription for public transport if you are going to use it regularly.

They shouldn't be rude. Probably quite reserved (foreigners often complain about that), and we have our bad apples (our lovely Mouvement Citoyen Genevois loves to complain about french people stealing our jobs), but otherwise we are mostly polite and kind.

The differences in law... yeah they are quite a lot, but sometimes after hearing how much of a mess things are on your side you probably will like the change ;)
But yeah, it is quite bureaucratic, and sometimes petty (no mowing your law on sundays!), but it works quite efficiently. I would recommand asking for more details for any important stuff (like housing, driving, and basically anything to do with the state or money).

The last question is one of the funniest I've heard about Switzerland! Nobody is required to have a gun, only people who have done military service keep their weapon at home as long as they are in their active years. 

Finally, I'll do a little publicity... Do no hesitate to seriously check out Fribourg University! It is smaller and maybe less prestigious than others (n°514 in the cwur.org 2014 ranking), but it's cheaper, more humane and the quality is very good. 1st year economy classes have like 170 students (that's what I've seen, anyway), and that's more or less as big as it gets. 

Anyway, hope you have a nice time in Switzerland!

dental service is much cheaper in Hungary, than in any other EU state. if you combine it with a casual sightseeing it can be a nice experience.

the best you can do from Switzerland is to head for Sopron. its right next the Austrian border. it is one of the biggest dental capitals in Hungary, with dentists on every corner, im sure you can find the fitting one for you.
