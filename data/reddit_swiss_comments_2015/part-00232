* Yellow = Easy (well maintained, large trails)
* Red = a little harder (narrow trails, boulders and uneven surfaces)
* Blue = alpine (my most recent discovery was a ladder through a cave in a cliff...)

You can scope out a route and read some reviews about it on http://www.hikr.org/.

If you're interested in doing something challenging but with options to peel off at various stages this is the one with the cliff ladder http://www.hikr.org/tour/post67420.html

I visited the US two times so far and I have to agree that the Swiss Cola tastes better! The US coca cola tastes sweeter and even more chemical lol.

It seems to be quite hard to order swiss coke from the US. You could maybe order it from [Hellenic](http://www.coca-colahellenic.com/), eventho they only supply shops, restaurants and stuff. You could also try to contact the coca cola social media sites.
