The network speed offered by Aldi is 4G/LTE as well (21 Mbps down, 8Mbps up, according to their website). As long as your phone supports it, you're good to go.

I'm only mentioning this because your post sounds like you think that prepaid = slow and contract = fast. That's not the case.
But, of course, if you prefer an unlimited data contract so that you never have to worry about the amount of data you use, then that's understandable too.

So first and most important thing for any foreigner: We don't hate people - we just have other social protocols. Swiss people take their time getting to know people - often years. We open up very slowly to other people - which can make it extremely frustrating trying to break into a social circle.

Also a big difference compared to the US, and somewhat in keeping with the point already raised, while we are also big on freedom and independence (a bit too big in my opinion), we're also very private have a social etiquette that boils down to ""don't bother me and I won't bother you"".

Ex food: totally different food culture from north to south, same with music, culture, popculture in general, ecc ecc.
Not to mention that every Canton, even villages, have peculiar differences.
I'm from the South and in general I've more in common with someone from Italy, compare to some from north Switzerland  
(German or French side). Especially the popculture I grow up with (books, music, television), is from Italy and it's totally different from someone who grow up in Zurich. 

A lot of  the example people are giving you, are typical from the Canton, city, village, or language side of the Country they are from. There is not a real Swiss culture, because we have a mix of culture, due to our languages and different influences we grow up with.

If by cultures you mean distinct subcultures such as a punk rock or hippies. Those are kinda sorta there, but not really. Usually, people interested in a certain lifestyle do meet but fail to reach critical mass for the style to gain traction and a kind of dynamic that it would need to persist. As such, the so called ""cultural scene"", for example, exists far from anything mainstream and is tiny and filled with what normal people consider to be crazy people who do nothing of value. The scene survives mostly due to funding handed out both by the state and private entities such as Migros.

while [this one](http://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/auch-musliminnen-muessen-badekleid-tragen-1.18603123) says that there were conflicts because muslims expected the pool to be not only women-only but also ruled in accordance to muslim rules already last year.
