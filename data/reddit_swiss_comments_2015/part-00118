While I believe you're right that you are technically allowed to just come to Switzerland on your EU passport and look for a job, you need to be able to support yourself financially until you do have a job. 1000, even 1500 Swiss francs will vanish very, very fast, especially in an expensive place such as Zurich, faster than you can find a job.

And you need to save some for a return trip to your home country (not to be pessimistic, just realistic: what happens when you have no job and no money left? So you'll have to keep that amount aside for, say, a bus ride home.) And as an unskilled foreigner who does not speak any of the local languages, you would be very lucky to find a job.

You could also get mugged and lose all your money. Switzerland is pretty safe but these things happen.

The language thing is going to be double trouble in the German parts of Switzerland: the official language is German, it's the written language everywhere, and everybody can speak it, however on a daily basis the people of Switzerland actually speak a dialect of German called Swiss German. It's really a group of dialects, some of them are quite different from another, but they all fall under the same umbrella of Swiss German. It's German as its core but it sounds very different from what you'd learn in school if you took German classes. 

So you'd have to know German, a.k.a. Hochdeutsch, which is the official language, to understand everything that's written in front of you (labels on supermarket items, street signs, government paperwork, newspapers, etc.) as well as know Swiss German in order to communicate effectively. Swiss German people can all speak ""standard"" German but they'll address you in Swiss German unless you request that they speak German with you.

In that regard you might actually have a somewhat easier time going to the French-speaking parts of the country instead of Zurich. You will still have to learn the local language, but you won't have to manage two at the same time. The western parts of Switzerland speak mostly standard French, with mild local accents, so if you just learned standard French by taking classes anywhere that teaches French, you'd be fine.

No matter where you go, though, you cannot get by with only English, you must have some basic knowledge of the local language(s).

Knowing a local language is an advantage but in no way is it a solution to all the problems you will have, especially with only 1000-1500 CHF, and they are not easy obstacles to overcome.

Also funny how in these threads all the gun nuts come out and start downvoting everyone that isn't as obsessed with violence as they are.

*edit*: Ah, I see you asked your buddies from /r/progun to back you up. That explains the voting. And yeah, posting in /r/progun really makes it sounds like you're all about sports.
