However, you are referring to the guarantee, which normally is given voluntarily by the producers as an additional service (by contract). The producer can dictate what damages that happened after selling the item he will pay (Apple care is a good example for contractual guarantee services; or the Mercedes StarClass guarantee).

And while I've heard that it has become quite a tourist trap and lost much of its authenticity it still combines access to many popular places (Lauterbrunnen valley, Jungfrau, Beatus caves, Ballenberg museum, Aare gorge, Thun) and a very broad selection of activities (if it's outdoor you can probably do it in Interlaken).
