For train/bus/boat/... in switzerland : www.cff.ch

For bus in Lausanne : www.tl.ch

weather : www.meteo.search.ch (you can also see a map of the precipitations)

You will probably need to buy a train/bus pass, those are the options :

- AG (abonnement général) : give you access to every bus/train/boat in switzerland (except some special train in some moutains where small company have their one trains that doesn't belong to the cff)
- Demi-Tarif : 1/2 price on trains, a reduction on buses. You still need to buy a ticket everyday, not necessary a good option for you.
- pass from TL (transports lausannois) : Only works with buses in the region of Lausanne and use a zone system : [inside Lausanne](http://www.t-l.ch/images/pdf/plan/mobilis-zoom-lausanne.pdf) and [more general](http://www.t-l.ch/images/pdf/plan/mobilis-plan-general.pdf)

If you come to study you will probably use the metro M1 to go to UNIL or EPFL. A pass from the TL with zone 11+12 is probably the cheapest option. If you want to explore switzerland and go see other places look at the AG. 

If you come to study in the EPFL and have questions about it, I can probably answer some of them.

EDIT : As far as I know you can use a pass from the TL for to use the train in the zones on your pass.
