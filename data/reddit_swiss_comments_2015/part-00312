null,null,Kempeth,sg,St. Gallen,null,"Going by the things you mentioned I recommend flying into Zürich and making your way down towards Italy. I don't know what your plans for Italy are but a straight line from Zürich to Zermatt (Matterhorn) more or less brings you past everything you mentioned and from there it's only a small hop to Italy.

As /u/ironyRing said there are a few places to ski in the summer but I've never tried it (I could find info about Zermatt and Saas-Fee)

As for transport onto mountains, as soon as you reach Lucerne you'll have plenty of choices. Popular mountains in that area are Rigi, Pilatus and Stanserhorn. Also from Lucerne you could take a boat to the Rütli the founding place of the old Switzerland.

If you take a slight detour from Zürich to Lucerne you could head to Einsiedeln to visit a beautiful monastery. From there the way to lucerne leads you more or less directly to the Rigi and/or the Rütli.

When you make to towards Interlaken from Lucerne you can visit the Aare gorge near Meiringen and the open air museum in Ballenberg. A very romantic stop on the way to Interlaken would be the Giessbach falls and the [Grandhotel Giessbach](http://www.giessbach.ch)

From Interlaken I'd recommend the Beatuscaves and the Lauterbrunnen valley. From there you can get on the Jungfraujoch (which is probably the cable car you've seen). A bit of a secret in that are are the Trümmelbach falls because unlike the many others in the valley they are underground. Another unusual place to stay in the area for a young couple would be the [Zeithotel](http://www.zeithotel.ch/) (Or you might find it too cheesy. I've never been there. I only found out about it when I was researching unusual hotels)

From there you could either make your way directly to Zermatt or put in a stop in Leukerbad - probably the most famous spa town in Switzerland (not that there aren't plenty of other options).

Finally instead of leaving Switzerland via Geneva you could head over to Locarno, Bellinzona, Lugano and step right over to Italy from there. The Ponte dei Salti, castles of Bellinzona, Madonna del Sasso, Brissago islands, San Salvatore mountain, Morcote village might be a great lead-in to your stay in Italy. From there you can easily reach much of Italy by train, car or even plane (Lugano airport)

As for activities, you can hardly throw a stone in Switzerland without hitting a hiking path. There are lots opportunities to bike (normal, mountain or dedicated downhill tracks). There are many high wire parks too and especially near Interlaken you'll have a smorgasboard of special activities like paragliding, cannyoning, river rafting, etc.",null,0,null,1439464587,null,null,false,0,cu1ghkl,null,t3_3gqlf3,null,null,null,t3_3gqlf3,null,null,null,1440453159,null,3,null,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3,null

My grasp on the English terms might be a bit shaky so I'll try to explain. First off here is and [incomplete map](http://www.swisstherme.ch/wellness.html) of thermal baths in Switzerland.

There are dedicated thermal baths, private hotel spas or public spas attached to hotels. Dedicated places generally focus more on pools, saunas, steam baths and a more general audience where as spas of high class hotels generally tend to have more extensive and exotic treatment and massage selections.
