I've actually always wondered how to determine where I come from in Switzerland.

Personally I feel like a Vaudois or Valaisan since those are the places I was born and raised in, and a lot of my family is from. I feel almost no connection to the german speaking side to be honest even though a lot of my family is from there, and I have a hard time when I go there since their mentality is so different. I could not imagine living there, I value too much the openness, internationality, and relaxed attitude that living between Geneva and Lausanne brings. It's actually funny, my mom who grew up swiss german and swiss french (Bern/Vaud/Valais region), and who ""escaped"" the swiss german side can actually not stand hearing SRF and such, and always complains about having to visit my dad's family cause they're so...
