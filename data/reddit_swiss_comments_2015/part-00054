Science in medicine isn't *that* hard. Do clinical trials and see if something is more effective than placebo. If after a bunch of trials you can't show any significant effect, then it's not. Just because placebo works on some people doesn't mean the medicine has the intended effect.

It's always the same story. Ask further when you hear things like that, and:

- The patient tried all kinds of alternative stuff and their problem disappeared at the same time they were trying something; in other words, it probably went away on its own.  
- The patient was also taking real medicine at the same time. (but they are convinced it's the alternative stuff that helped)  
- The alternative medicine didn't say so, but contained a significant amount of real medicine. (e.g. grapefruit seed extract)

Maybe I can add another one: Germany is pretty much the leader of the EU (at least it is often perceived as such) and many Swiss are very critical of the EU, more so these days than maybe 5 or so years ago. So it's easy to make the association that EU = Germany.

This intolerance is a saddening to me, because we don't differ *that* much to be honest, but the error isn't just with these Swiss people. A number of German immigrants act as if we don't differ at all and Swiss people are proud of their uniqueness. So a German who seems unaware or ignores these differences will have a bad time.

During the early 19th century, new suffrage laws were made to allow general (male) suffrage (every male citizen could vote). This means that the danger of aristocrats arranging the election and therefore the need for sortition could have been lessened.

Also, especially in rural regions, political offices were probably unpaid in that time, albeit they required quite some time investment. The working class just could not afford to be absent from work and therefore had to turn down the office if elected by sortition. It was probably easier to vote for people who would actually accept the election.
