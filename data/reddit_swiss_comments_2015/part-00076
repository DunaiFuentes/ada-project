What engine did you use til now? Unreal 3 I assume?

Why not just release what you have (or finish it off if there is more to add) with the old engine and start working on a second installment of the game with new levels in the new engine? If your first game is priced well on steam you should be able to sell enough copies. Then Valve will usually allow subsequent games from the same developer without to much fuss.

It just seems over the top to rip out the engine just before release and redo it all, so I'm a little confused and would like to hear your reasoning.

I don't know for sure of course but it seems that you might not surpass 50'000 (after valve's cut) on your first game released on steam. And if you do (fingers crossed) you can still get the better one from them.

I can totally understand why you would like to use the latest and greatest UR4 especially because of the platform support. But I still wouldn't let most of what you already have go to waste. I mean what's the problem with releasing what you have and instead investing the work you'd do by porting in a newer version? Do you think you could lose criticle momentum if the first version isn't at its best at release? Or is it that you wouldn't manage to get game number two out the door while you still have the offer for the better terms on UR4
