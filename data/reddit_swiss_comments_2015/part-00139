You can always start looking for a better paying job down the line if they don't offer you a raise in some years.

You can certainly live comfortably with that type of salary in Switzerland and once you are integrated into the Swiss working environment, your chances of finding a better job will increase by a lot, instead of saying no and then looking for a job in Switzerland from Portugal.

See this as a way to gain experience in a swiss workplace that will provide you more chances in the future. I don't know why people assume that you can't survive with that salary when I managed to live very comfortably with way less for 5 years. 

**People tend to forget that it's a different situation when you already live and work in Switzerland, and are completely integrated into the Swiss market.** 

I don't doubt that the salary is not as high as they would offer to someone already living here, but if you want to jump the boat to a better life, I doubt you will find a better opportunity in the future.
