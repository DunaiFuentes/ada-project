It's not just a hype. It's going to stay, mark my word. Other countries in the world (like Japan) have contact-less payment options well established in the lives of their citizens already. With cards, cellphones etc. As usual we're a bit slow with these things and it's only manifesting now.

The benefit is clearly the convenience for the customer and it's easier for the conductor too. He no longer has to check if the photo is actually you or if the card is still valid. He'll be able to check more people in a shorter time period.

In Japan I can just put my wallet on the scanner, walk through the gate and ride any train I like. Granted it's not a personal card, but a prepaid one.
