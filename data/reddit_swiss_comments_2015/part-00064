The only thing that changed is that I access my FreeNas over port 80 and not 5001,  and those ports are forwarded on my router. 

I refuse to use a VPN,  since I would pay my ISP,  and the VPN provider because I am not satisfied with my ISP,  which is not a permanent solution for me. But if you want to use one,  you can setup the vpn connection directly on your Synology. Google 'Synology connect to VPN network' for tutorials.

Since I will get fiber soon and will cancel my Cablecom subscription, I will not invest anymore time into it,  and my FreeNas seems to work fine with Cablecom anyway.

If you have some specific questions about your Nas or VPN,  please let me know. I tried VyperVPN and it worked great for the time I was using it.

Buy a used bike or use the abundant public transport. Or walk, the city is tiny from your perspective. You can literally cross most of it in one hour on foot.

&gt; transportation to other countries

Trains. The tickets ain't cheap. Nothing is.


&gt; how bad the cost of living really is,

Lunch at Uni: $6, rent for 1 room: $600, health insurance per month: $200. Expect $1500 monthly expenses.

&gt; how the nightlife/social scene is for people my age

Great. Drinking age is 18, Zürich has a decent clubbing scene afaik (I'm too old to know)

&gt; the weather for that time of year (august-december)

Bring a winter coat, sweaters and and an umbrella or five. Probably no snow yet.

&gt; options for hiking/scenic/outdoor activities (obviously there's a lot but what specifically), 

Way too much to be specific. I'll recommend visiting a castle (loads nearby), go to Mürren or Adelboden for a week-end (bring good hiking shoes), visit Luzern or Basel or Bern to see a pretty city, and have a swim in the lake while it's warmish.
