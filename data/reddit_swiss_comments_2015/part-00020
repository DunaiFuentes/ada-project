A central bank has a balance sheet, just like any bank. On the SNB balance sheet, issued francs count as a liability. These liabilities are offset by assets (such as loans to private banks and foreign currency reserves). If liabilities greatly outweigh assets, the central bank becomes insolvent and a risk exists that the currency will fall in value. Since the SNB can't really buy francs by issuing francs, this is a potential disaster.

Right now about half the SNB assets are in Euros, and to maintain the peg it would need to continue buying Euros, even as the likely rate of return on these European bonds nears or surpasses zero.
