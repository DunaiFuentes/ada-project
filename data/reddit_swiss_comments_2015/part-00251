But after you're there, you just find a spot on the grass and enjoy the concerts, if possible not behind the big tree; they usually have an excellent program, even if it's for free. 

Note that the park is on a slope, and usually pot smokers (which sometimes includes musicians) go on top of the slope where it's a little discreet. 

Also, the booze is quite expensive, so try to take your own. But there is plenty of food all around: sausages, asian, kebabs, mexican, everything (but at MJF prices, which are the swissest of Swiss prices). 

Finally, the toilets are at the park itself. They're horrendous but well, that's what it is. If you're a girl (and even a bloke) prepare to queue--again. 

Once you're there, just try to stay where you are and make sure you have everything with you, kind of like in a camping trip, because going to a food shop 15 meters away and come back will take you like 45 minutes.
