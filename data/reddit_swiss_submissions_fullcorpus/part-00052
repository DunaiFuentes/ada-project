One of the tidbits that always gets tossed around by the pro-gun crowd is ""look at Switzerland, everyone has a gun and they're one of the safest places in the world"", followed by a picture of someone in a Swiss store with a rifle slung over their shoulder.  I have always been under the impression that, although there is high per capita gun ownership in Switzerland (through mandatory military service), that the guns and ammunition were tightly controlled (i.e. mandatory registration, training, etc).  This seems to always be conveniently left out when these arguments are put forth. I remember being on a plane trip back to the US from Switzerland one time and got into a conversation with my seat mate (who I'm pretty sure was Swiss, but I could be wrong) about hunting. He was telling me about the extensive classes and permits he was required to go through before he was given a permit to do any hunting... This always seems to get left out in these kinds of arguments, the idea of RESPONSIBLE gun ownership, which might include licensing, training, registration, etc.  

Based on this, I was wondering if anyone with first hand knowledge could comment on the true state of gun ownership in Switzerland?

EDIT: thank you all for your thoughtful commentary! I hear this argument used all the time here and am glad to finally get the ""real story""!
