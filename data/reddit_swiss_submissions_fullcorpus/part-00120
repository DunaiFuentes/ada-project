I have been looking through the Swiss site and trying to contact the embassy to see if her citizenship could be reclaimed.

However, then it mentions: ""To recover Swiss citizenship, you must prove a close connection with Switzerland.""

Most our family lives in Switzerland and we can provide a close connection. In fact, both she and my Oma are traveling there next summer (My Oma still has her citizenship). My mom would love the opportunities to live and stay there if she chooses.
