I can do a PayPal transaction for the item and freight cost. Thanks for your time.

Shipping can be via Swiss Post as it is the cheapest and I am in no crazy rush for it. 

EDIT: Doh! I just realized that in small print at the bottom it says it is not readily available. I apologize for all the confusion! I had just assumed since it allowed me to add it to the cart that it was in stock!

-&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_sovereign_wealth_funds

As you probably know, a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) is a state-owned investment fund investing in real and financial assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate, precious metals, or in alternative investments such as private equity fund or hedge funds. Switzerland is said to be the 20th richest country in the world. The authorities should easily be able to manage a successful and profitable SWF, especially if it was built on their dividends taken from SNB annual profits.

525,3 Milliarden Franken ....

&gt;Schweiz druckte aggressiver als alle anderen Geld
Wie stark die Interventionen waren, macht die Bilanzsumme der SNB deutlich. Diese hat sich seit Beginn der Maßnahmen im Jahr 2011 monströs aufgebläht. Mit 525,3 Milliarden Franken ist sie mehr als drei Mal so groß wie 2008. Damit haben die schweizerischen Währungshüter im Verhältnis fast genauso viel ""Geld gedruckt"" wie die amerikanische Federal Reserve (Fed).[1]

Had they invested that into shares, we'd own half of europe by now. 

We could take, for example, 10% of SNB annual dividends and transfer them in 5 funds.

* infrastructure fund (Gotthard tunnels, SBB, highways etc.)
* strategic ressources fund (oil, food, refineries, etc.)
* redistribution fund (to be shared with the population if needed, for example ahv-iv)
* financial emergency fund (not to be touched before financial crises)
* sovereign investment fund

Later, those funds would be managed by the an authority under the control of the National Assembly and could only be opened after a popular vote. Imagine how much we could reduce taxes and how better would our infrastructures become, if we had created such a fund in the 80's. Look at Singapore or even at Norway, our harsh opponent of the North. ...

Why don't we have some of those useful funds? :(
