Usually i am a snowboarder, but i will have a friend over who wants to see the swiss alps.
Do you guys know a place where we can go sledging in the alps?

I have no idea where to go :(

My dream would be an awesome view and a ski lift or something to get up.
It should be at max. 2 hours away from Zurich.

And would you suggest a bob or a davoser sledge?

So my question is,  how much of what I've been told is true and what do I need to know once I turn 18.

I am a US college student hoping to visit for 2-3-4ish days between March 7th and March 15th. 
Ideally I would fly into Zurich and take a train to a town (this is where I need your help) where I could stay at a youth hostel (much cheaper than the ski resort) and snowboard for 2-3 days. This is spring break for US college students and I don't know if Switzerland has a similar schedule.
But recommendations on a reasonably affordable ski resort that would be a hot spot for other college students and has easy access via bus/train would be greatly appreciated.

The important thing for me is easy access, I know ski resorts aren't exactly in the middle of towns but if you didn't have a car what would you and your friends do?
