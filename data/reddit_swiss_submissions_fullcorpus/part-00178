I am currently working on a design of a nursing house in Switzerland, close to Laussane. And I am now trying to think of the ""social"" room, where the old people could feel good.

Or, if that domain doesn't ring any bell, would someone mind pointing their browser to their rss aggregation and pm'ing me with the result?

(Background for the slightly technically inclined: that site was under a DOS attack a couple of months back, and they probably played shell games with their CDN to bypass that. Whatever exactly happened, Swisscom seems to not be routing to the CDN correctly. I've been unable to access my RSS feeds ever since - except when I'm on our VPN to another ISP. I tried calling Swisscom, and disillusionment ensued: none of the three consecutive reps understood a word about routing and tracing. Maybe I just don't know the magic word to up the tier, but... ouch.)

So, anyway, one or two mildly motivated testers would be appreciated.
(And, of course, were a Swisscom media rep to spy on the forum: dis-ap-pointed here! How do I get in touch with a tech savvy engineer there, eh?)

Also, will co-op sell alcohol to me ( I am 16), because i have heard that they refuse to sell to anyone under 18.
