Today I went to Mediamarkt to buy GTA V for PC. I saw their price offer of 64.95 CHF on toppreise.ch. I know that I could have ordered it much cheaper online elsewhere but I don't want to wait for the shipping. 

So I went into the store and there it was labeled with 69.95 CHF. Just 5 francs more, but still. So I wondered why this could be and approached a random employee. He explained me in a passive aggressive manner that it is because of the store rent, wages of the employees, security, etc. Finally he told me that the employee at the games section desk would take care of it. I think he meant deducting this 5 francs difference of the price. 

I was a bit pissed off by the manner  he explained me this and I still couldn't make much sense of it because online you have similar variables and also shipping included!

So I went to the games section desk, but there was no one and so I left soon after waiting a bit. I'm now heading for exlibris where it costs 69.90 CHF, but they have at least the same price online and in store. Plus they're much nicer, plus they belong to Migros, thus to the GENOSSENSCHAFT!
