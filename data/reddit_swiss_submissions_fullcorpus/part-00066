So, from browsing this sub, I've seen that this is raised quite a bit. I was hoping you guys could share some tips with me. 

Some background on me may be in order. I am currently a 17 year old American. I will most likely be attending Franklin college in Lugano, Switzerland next year. I speak near fluent French and plan on learning German and Italian in my time in college. 

My past experience in Switzerland was a semester abroad in 2010, my sophomore year. I fell in love with the country, culture, geography, really everything. I would give anything to return, and would be eternally grateful to be a citizen and resident of your fine country! 

Regarding plans after school, I would ideally join the Swiss Air Force, as I feel it would be unfair of me to skirt around the military requirement for citizens if I were hoping to live in the country. From what I've read, enrolling in the FAS is a fairly permanent decision, which would effect careers down the road. I would be prepared to make that decision. 

So, that's all I can really speak of. What tips might you have for me?

One company said that they had to lie when they tried to hire an American and he was only granted a 3 month permit and then had to go home. 

Is it easier to get a job with a large company? I would preferably work for a small company. I would like to work in the computer science/programming field. It seems the only way I can come to CH is on a student visa, but I already have two graduate degrees. Even a research position at a university would be fine for me. 

I would like to stay in the German part of Switzerland (Zurich or the Canton of Lucerne). I would be coming with my wife and young daughter (my wife would be a stay at home mom, i.e., she does not need a work permit.
