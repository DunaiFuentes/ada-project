I just finished my PhD in a data-related science and recently received an official offer to do my dream job in Zurich.

The offer I received is basic salary approx. 115k CHF plus 200 CHF monthly food expense, plus company pays for basic health insurance and social security (i.e. I would not pay these two from the 115k).  Additional performance-based bonus.

The offer seems really nice, I'm really excited about the chance to live and work in Zurich, and the .ch salary calculators and glassdoor.com all indicate that this is a competitive offer for my combination of experience / education / location, etc.  

However a lot of the English language forums I've been trawling seem to suggest it would still be low, or that you need to be making like 150k to get by in Zurich.  Wrapping up years of living off of a fellowship and lots of cup-ramen this is hard for me to believe, but I thought it worth asking all the same.  

Will I be comfortable with this offer or should I be a bit worried?  I realize there is not necessarily a simple yes/no answer to this, but I'd be glad to hear at least a couple of off-the-cuff opinions.  

Thanks for your time!

Edit:  Thanks for all your responses, they made me feel a bit more at ease.  I leave you with a video of 'surfing in Switzerland':
