I'm a poor student and decided to cut some expenses by eating a bit less / different. So I decided to switch to ramen. I haven't eaten any since a few years and oh surprise, I love them.

Now comes my problem: one small portion, bought in my local PAM, costs 1CHF/portion. It isn't expensive compared to regular noodles + sauce, but it isn't cheap either given the size of the serving.

I've been met by disappointment at every turn.  

Something like 15 years ago, a Swiss friend of my parents was in America, visiting us.  With her, she brought these, now legendary, bear cookies.  Apparently, they were all the rage among Swiss children, at the time.  No one in my family liked them, and at first, neither did I.  But, I was tasked with eating them, and with every little bear, my appreciation grew.  But, when the friend left, so did my supplier.

My parents fell out of contact with their friend, and I gave up hope of ever finding the cookies again.  But, it was in this moment, when all hope was lost, that my parents once again came in contact with their friend.  I thought my days of questing were finished, but alas, she had no memory of the cookies!

The cookies are approximately 7cm x 7cm x 2cm, brown, and shaped like a realistic looking bear, seen from the side, on all fours.  There's no detail to the bear, just its silhouette.  They are chewy but not too sweet.  They kind of remind me of marzipan, but they aren't marzipan.

a common phrase when talking about Switzerland or Swiss people here in Austria is ""Die Schweiz ist anders"" (Switzerland is different) this lead me to a question: 

How different are the Swiss language group compared to each other? Would you say you share the same kind of attitude and character traits as a Swiss person, no matter if it's an Italian, German, Romansch or French speaker? Or would you say that Francophone Swiss are more like the French than like a German speaking Swiss? Is the ""Schweizer Gemütlichkeit"" (Swiss cosiness) just a German speaking phenomenon or typical for all Swiss people?

I know of course that ""everybody is different"" and ""you can't compare people without speaking in stereotypes"" but let's do it anyway :).

Another, slightly related question: We call the Voralberger as a joke ""Pseudo Schweizer"" since they are the only people in Austria speaking an Alemannic dialect instead of Bairisch and the contact between Austria and Vorarlberg is non existent (I now many, many Swiss but not a single Vorarlberger, they just don't exist for me...). Is this true from your point of view? Are they more Swiss than Austrian (assumed you know other Austrians, preferable not only Vienesse, to compare)?

On Sunday I'm coming to Geneva for a week for work. I'll probably have a bit of time while I'm there to explore the city a bit, but I'll still be quite busy with work. At the end of the week, I'm staying on Saturday and then going back to Canada on Sunday. So... I'm wondering if anyone has some suggestions for what I can do for my one free, full day (Saturday) in Switzerland! 

I'm assuming by then I'll have seen Geneva well enough and it would be nice to explore a bit, but I do have a place to stay in Geneva so I'm thinking a day trip will be in order. One of my friends mentioned Interlaken but I don't know much about it other than that it's supposed to be beautiful. 

Are there any cool events or festivals going on at that time (27 Oct)? Any suggestions are welcome!

Oh, one last question: I speak French but I don't speak any German. I know the Swiss are very multilingual, so I doubt communication will be an issue, but are people in the German part of the country mostly able to speak French? Or would I be better off just speaking English?
