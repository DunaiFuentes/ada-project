But my problems have been arising just about now. We both are unemployed and are living in flat that costs 900 fr/month.  The problem is that the person is paying the rent and gives some money for living to her. The person doesn`t help me in any other way and that is understandable because i dont do any benefit to them. From now on i have to start to pay the rent of my half (450fr) which is okay but... also from the past months that i have been living here. and this info got me on monday.  so it is quite absurd to ask to pay the rent from last months. as it was not mentioned before. this month is ok, and the next one etc, its normal. There was an agreement that IF we both are UNEMPLOYED they will cover the rent and give some money for food etc. As iam still writing with my unemployed hands as my unemployed gf is sleeping. 


Though it has been said and made an verbal agreement that if we both are employed, they will help us financially. I feel little bit of backstabbed of this. I know that I have to pay the rent because there is no other option but still is it a typical situation in here that you will be asked to pay all the rents afterwards?
 Imagine yourself going to a restaraunt and the meal was on the house, next time when you go back there they feel ashamed that they gave you the free meal and want charge you for it afterwards? 

We both like this country a lot but this thing is new to me, i have never been in this kinda of situation in other countries.

Ps. if you need a good and reliable worker in Chur, pls message me ;)

EDITED: removed some parts for privacy of others and ours, hope you understand :) like the date when i have to pay is pending before this is settled. and  because wouldnt want people to think wrong. they have been helping us a quite a lot, especially my gf. which matters to me alot. but this thing is ONLY between ME and Some other persons at the moment. Going to see them face to face and hopefully this thing will be sorted out. 

thank you very much of youre answers and thoughts, they were highly  appreciated!

And some quick answers to questions for now before going to sleep.


i dont have any written contract with anyone.
i dont have a working permit at the moment and i know it is quite fucked up.
