Right now I am really leaning towards Switzerland because it seems like an amazing country that is similar to my native Canada. It is probably also important to mention that I am studying finance and money is not a big problem as tuition will be roughly the same thing I pay in Canada. Which university would be better for me? Any advice on living, food... etc.. anything I should know really? Thank you :D

My fiancee and I will be spending a week in Switzerland in September for our honeymoon. We have access to a vacation home in Laax, so we will be taking advantage of the free housing.

I was hoping you all could give us some ideas on what to do for the week. As background, we are from the US and in our mid-20s. We both enjoy physical activity, though we don't want to spend our entire honeymoon running around! We are on a bit of a budget, so we don't want to do an insane amount of travelling - sticking to Laax and the surrounding area would be preferred. Also, we will be flying in and out of Zurich, so we could make a day out of that.
