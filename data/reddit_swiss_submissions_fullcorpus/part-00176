I've posted here a few days ago about my situation:

My flight back to the USA is on the 31st at 10AM.

I am being forced out of my housing on the 30th at around 10AM. My plan so far:

1) Leave Lausanne at 10:30AM.

2) Arrive at Zurich HB around 2PM.

3) Put my luggage in a locker? For free?

4) ???

5) Return to Zurich HB, sleep on the floor for the night.

6) Check in my flight in the morning.


---------------------------

Sounds like a pretty miserable day, my school program really screwed me over. I was supposed to leave on the 31st, but they did not want to check me out in time for my flight, so I am forced to leave a day earlier!

Any ideas what to do? Step by step instructions would help too, since I tend to get lost/worry about what-ifs easily. 

I was thinking about taking a train to Basel after I put my stuff in the locker just to check it out.

The prices to stay a night at Zurich HB hotel is pretty hefty (50 CHF for 3 hours I believe?) so I'm wondering if I can just sleep on the chairs or something.

EDIT: Actually, just a couch in the ""rest area"" is 40CHF for a night I think. I might just do that!


Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
