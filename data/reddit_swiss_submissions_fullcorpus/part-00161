Is public transport reliable (and affordable)? Or more realistically is it even possible to survive without a car? 

Will I be able to get by with English? I can read French but I never get to speak it much back home so it might as well be non-existent. (I'll probably get a tutor when I've settled down)

Also, is anyone nearby and would like to meet up when I arrive?

Me and my girlfriend live in Hungary and we plan on moving to Switzerland.
I've read a bunch of articles and forum posts about living there and the costs and so on.
I still have some questions I'd love to be answered:

1) I read that it is better to arrange most of the paperwork from home and when my job is guaranteed only THEN move there. This was what I planned from the beginning, but I'm wondering how hard is it actually.
Is it really quite possible to have a job interview or a contract signed through internet? I know it's possible I'm just not sure it's that official or legit.
2) I use English quite frequently and I have B2 German language exam. She also uses English and she has a B2 French language exam. I guess it's not bad for Switzerland, and we are willing to learn French and German from each other. My question is: Is it enough that we know these? I heard Swiss German is quite different from High German. Will I be able to understand Swiss people with my B2 German knowledge?
3) I work as a stock room operator skilled at GE. I know there is a GE in Switzerland too. Does it count that I've benn working here for more than a year now? Wondering if that might be a good point if I wanted to apply for a job to the Swiss GE.
My girlfriend is a bookkeeper. Is this a needed profession there or should she find something else first?
4) I know I might never will be a true Swiss citizen there, but how big of a problem is that I'm from another country especially Hungary?
Are our chances that lower or it really only depends on my CV?
5)We plan on going there by car which is half a day driving there.
Is it worth to maintain a car or better use public transportation?

For now I think that's all I wanted to ask.
Thank you for your answers in advance,
Navetelen
