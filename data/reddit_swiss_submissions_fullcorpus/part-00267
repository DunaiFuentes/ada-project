My GF and I will be having a short trip to Switzerland (from UK) this weekend. We land early Friday morning and leave Monday evening. We will be staying at a hotel in Lucerne.

I have been researching as much as I can and at times, it has been quite daunting!

On Friday, we will get a train from Zurich Airport to Lucerne, check in, and have a wander around the town (and old town). Can we still squeeze in a trip on the boat to Vitznau? Or maybe the transport museum instead? Anything else we should do on our day of arrival?

The best day (in terms of weather) seems to be Sunday. Due to this, we are looking at taking a train to Berne for the day - is there enough to see to fill out a whole day in Berne? 

Sunday will be the trip up to Interlaken, including stops at Lauterbrunnen, Grindelwald, Murren, Wengen, and with a trip up on the Jungfraujoch railway - let's hope we have good weather!

Monday - we are thinking of having a ride up Mt Rigi and possible Mt Pilatus as well.

Is there enough here? Anything I am missing? 

Thanks in advance.",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,Itinerary for 4 days this weekend,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/36hf62/itinerary_for_4_days_this_weekend/
