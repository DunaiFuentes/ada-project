I have been searching and reading and learning all about your beautiful country and will finally have the chance to go visit in a couple of weeks.

I had one question that I could not seem to answer myself, after hours and hours or research, and decided that asking the locals would be best. Which place would you recommend buying lift tickets for (I can only afford one day in the region)-- Grindelwal, Murren, or Wengen? 

I am an intermediate/advanced snowboarder who is more interested in runs with gorgeous views than I am about terrain parks (I can get plenty of that where I am from, not so much the views). My understanding is that:

[Grindelwald](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/snowandski/switzerland/grindelwald/11342987/Ski-Grindelwald-resort-guide.html) is the largest one, with long runs but with long lift lines. It's situated lower on the mountain so the views won't be as great?

[Murren](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/snowandski/switzerland/murren/6752877/Ski-Murren-resort-guide.html) is a gorgeous town but it is a bit smaller, with its main attraction being the Schilthorn run. From what I've seen on Youtube videos, the views look great but I am a bit worried as a snowboarder because there seemed to be long runs of almost flat terrain. This would be a problem if I wiped out and lost all momentum, forcing me to walk down... Also there seemed to be some very narrow parts which would also be difficult for snowboarders. 

Lastly, [Wengen](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/snowandski/switzerland/wengen/6753689/Ski-Wengen-resort-guide.html) is smaller with good intermediate runs.

Thanks for any help!

If that is not possible, my boyfriend said he would move to Berne instead, where the same conditions (close to public transport) apply. We are also considering Lausanne and Fribourg, where the rent would have to be a bit cheaper than 1.800 because then we'd both have to commute.

If that doesn't work either, we're considering Neuchatel, where I think rent would be a lot more affordable, but my boyfriend isn't too keen on moving there.

Since Switzerland is being more and more restrictive with immigration, do you guys think it will be hard to move there or exists a lot of stigma vs immigrants?
