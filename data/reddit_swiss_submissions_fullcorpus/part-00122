I've got an important question regarding gun ammo in Switzerland. I'm wondering what the rules and regulations are regarding private ammo possession in Switzerland. I am aware Switzerland scrapped government issued subsidized ammo for storage at home a few years ago. However what are the rules regarding privately bought ammo? Can any Swiss citizen walk into a gun shop and purchase ammo for private consumption and keep it at home? Is ammo only allowed to be bought on ranges and expended on the same day? Is the waffen license required?

But when I got off the train the station the only departing trains were going north, back up to Bellinzona. I had no idea where I was so I ended up going back up there and getting on a train I knew would go all the way to Chiasso.

This morning I tried to look for the station I was at on Google maps. Train stations are pretty easy to spot but I can't seem to find where I was. There were 3 or 4 platforms and all of them terminated at the station. There was a fairly sharp bend in the road around the platforms and it looked like a central bus stop. There was also a McDonalds about a block away. 

Does anyone know where I was? It felt like I was near the city center but it was dark and raining pretty heavily so it was hard to tell. Not being able to find it on Google Maps makes it feel like an eery dream or ghost memory.
