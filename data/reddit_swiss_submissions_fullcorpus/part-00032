I am heading to Switzerland in January was planning to spend the week of the 30th of Jan till the 3rd of Feb at Portes Du Soliel and really need some help!

I am on somewhat of a budget and need to stay somewhere such as a backpackers or youth hostel! Could someone please recommend me somewhere that is both cheap and that has great access to the slopes?

I am a snowboarder and would classify myself as average skilled. I really enjoy long and scenic runs where I can just casually cruise and enjoy the view!

I was also wondering if someone could explain to me how easy it is to get around? is it clearly marked? (the runs). I love the idea of skiing across borders as it is certainly something I cannot do here in New Zealand!

I do not mind where I stay (in CH or France!) so would love any recommendations or tips you guys could give me 

Cheers!

I'm a Canadian in my early 20's doing a tour of Europe (well, pretty limited to the UK, a bit of France and Switzerland) and my plans for Switzerland are falling apart. I have a scheduled visit at CERN (Centre Europeen de Recherche Nucleaire) on January 10th and my flight back to Canada is on January 11th (at like 5 AM). I'll be landing at the Geneva airport, coming from Nantes on Monday January the 9th, and would need a place to crash on that day.

I really don't mind where it is, as long as it is somewhat accessible by public transportation from the Geneva airport and that I'll be able to get to CERN by 10 am the next day.

If you've heard of any decent hostels for students or any other ideas let me know! Visiting CERN was one of my top priorities and I would hate to miss it because I can't find a place to stay!

It isn't because my pride is hurt because America may not be the super power we all (over here) still think it is, it is a general discontent and disgruntlement that has been built in me for a few years now.

I guess I could list a few reasons:

- [Illusory superiority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority)
A study (sorry no link) recently suggested that American children are both among the most confident and lowest performing in the world.

- A general lack of respect for science, something that is very dear to me. Over here, human-caused climate change and evolution are viewed as a matter of belief. Public figures regularly say ""I don't believe in climate change or global warming."" This, as hard as I try to resist, gets under my skin. They are projecting beliefs on areas of science. They don't realize that modern biology is built on evolution and that there is a scientific (not political or religious but a **scientific**) consensus on climate change. And so every time they say these things they refute the basis of modern science. This is perfectly acceptable by role models wide; I actually saw a video of the Miss America Beauty Pageant contestants, who are probably role models for younger girls nationwide, and every single one refuted evolution. It's a shame they can't know the beautiful and inherent simplicity in it; nothing radical or faith-breaking.

- The inability of our government to come through in times of crisis. Most of Europe probably has heard of our recent credit downgrading. This is a result of corruption within our own congress. The insertion of money into politics has corrupted the system. To back that, the general ignorance of voters have made a Republican agreeing with Obama anathema - meaning that some Republicans cannot politically agree with something very logical because their belief would coincide with the Democrats (Obama is democratic while the opposing party is Republican - we have largely a two-party system).

- Our country, which has been built on the immigration and assimilation of other cultures, has redacted its support of immigration (I am talking in general public terms). This is largely do to an illegal immigration problem - which in turn is due to an overcomplicated immigration process.

- Bigotry. The U.S. Constitution guarantees the separation of church and state and equal rights for all citizens. Still there is rampant homophobia - the reason cited being that the Bible says it is an ""abomination."" First of all, there is a separation of church and state, so while one is entitled to believe that, they may not govern by that logic. Second, there are equal rights for all men and women. Thirdly, being gay is obviously not a ""choice"" as some put it. Finally, who the hell wants to insert themselves into others lives? Why can't we all just let each other live our own lifestyles. The only thing a gay couple can do to you is - if you are homophobic - make you feel uncomfortable for a short time. And if you want to deprive them a happy lifestyle for that, I don't know what to say.

I want to say that there are plenty of good things about the U.S.; I am not mentioning them though because that is not the point. The point is that I believe that these things are different in Switzerland (right?). As I have read, most recycle and the energy system is very advanced, almost no CO2 output. While the U.S. scrabbles to burn more coal, in Switzerland they aim to get off of nuclear power. In the U.S., I would be happy to be nuclear dependent!

Also, I love science and the science in the U.S. is on the decline (see this [interesting video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXIR9ve0JU0)). My ""dream job"" of sorts would be working for CERN.

I know most of you perhaps have little interest in this post or my complaints, but nevertheless, it has been satisfying to vent a little to a non-captive audience. Perhaps Switzerland isn't the haven I think it is? I mean I know no place is perfect, but I think the Swiss people seem progressive and open-minded. I feel like the Swiss will be leading technology and science as with that region of Europe in the future. Am I completely insane to want to move there after I go to college?
