I graduated from university in the UK this summer. My parents have lived in Switzerland (Zurich) for a few years and after returning here in the summer, I found work in Lausanne and moved here at the start of this month.

I have been staying with my aunt and uncle for the last few weeks but I really need to find a place of my own, either a studio, small flat or even flat share if the flat is nice!

I'm earning a decent enough wage at this job and it's a permanent thing, so it's not like the rent would be short term or that I have no stability or I'm a liability in terms of income. 

I was wondering if anybody would be able to help me find a place to live, demand in Lausanne for a place is really high, the places I've been looking at have all been cheap (around 900 CHF / month) but this market seems to be dominated by desparate students.

I earn 5000/month before tax, so I guess my max price is probably in the region of 1200 / month but there doesn't seem to be much choice for this bracket (at least in the centre of Lausanne), although demand for any kind of accommodation seems to be insane here. 

I work normal office hours 9-5ish, just outside Lausanne, so actually going to an estate agent is very difficult as this country doesn't really operate during the weekends... 

I know of all the usual channels, glocals, englishforum.ch, anibis, homegate, immoscout etc. There's always a huge demand for places and I end up being just one on a list of 50 people. The gerances are difficult to deal with as I can't go in during office hours and sit down to discuss. 

So I know it's a long-shot but I wonder if a fellow redditor might know of a place or room that's for rent. I'm getting more and more desperate.",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,"I know it's a long shot, but can anybody help me find an appartment in Lausanne ",9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/eb9on/i_know_its_a_long_shot_but_can_anybody_help_me/
