Some background information; I'm a fifteen year old boy (will be sixteen when I go) and I was actually born in Switzerland, but my family moved back to U.S.A. when I was three and a half. So, I just want to make sure I get the most out of my experienced, and I had a few questions!

I'm going to be spending half of the month I'm in Switzerland in Geneva (where I was born) and in Zug. Now, about Geneva and Zug; I've read the cantons have differing alcohol laws. Do Geneva and Zug allow sixteen year olds to drink beer, wine, and cider? Or is it eighteen there?

Also, does anyone know what hospital a person who lived in Anières would go to give birth? I know this may sound vague but I really want to visit the hospital I was born in and this is all the information I have to go on!

Does anyone know what there is to do around Geneva and Zug? I'm going with my mother but hopefully I'll be able to hang out with my older friend (who has a car) in Geneva at night and perhaps find someway to experience nightlife in Zug.

As someone who lives in the southern part of the U.S.A. I've never seen snow. When I go to Switzerland in the summer, are there any unseasonably cold days I'll experience snow or will I have to go up to Mont Blanc to really see snow?

I've been assured by my mom that most people in Switzerland know English, but regardless I'm still trying to brush up on my French for Geneva. Will I need to have some knowledge of German to function in Zug, or do as many people as is rumored know English over there?

Are there any other things I should know about Switzerland? Like I said, I'm REALLY looking forward to this trip and I want to get the most out of it.
