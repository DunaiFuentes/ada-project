I'm a Polish girl about to move to Switzerland. Long story short - met my partner while working abroad and after discussing our possibilities we decided to move to his country, instead of staying in mine.

The problem is - I'm currently unemployed, graduated with a BA in oriental studies over a year ago and right now I don't have a regular income. I would have to start looking for a job in Switzerland. I've been doing a lot of research on all the necessary permits, but even though I tried to make sense out of everything, some rules are still unclear to me. I'm quite worried whether I will be able to get the L permit and the perspective of formalities standing in the way of settling there is, umm, extremely unpleasant, so I was wondering if anyone could advise me on how to deal with them and tell me what are my chances of succeeding.

**Facts:**

- I'm a resident of an EU-25 country.

- I don't have a job in Switzerland yet, so I would have to look for it when I get there.

- I have a sure place to stay with my partner already (+very cheap rent). I can sign the contract the moment I get to Switzerland.

**Questions / unclear issues:**

- The rules state:

&gt; EU/EFTA nationals may enter Switzerland for job-searching purposes. No permit is required for stays of up to three months. If no job can be found within this time, the appropriate local or cantonal authorities will grant a short-term residence permit (type L permit) valid for another three months' job search.

But there's also a rule like this:

&gt; You can enter the country freely and must register with the Residents Registry Office at the cantonal migration offices within 14 days of your arrival in Switzerland and apply for a residence permit if you want to stay for longer than three months.

I'm not really sure how to interpret this. So, an L permit will be issued if I apply for it after 3 months of looking for a job without a success... but I have to register and apply for this permit within 14 days of my arrival already? I don't know when to apply in this case. (Just to be clear - I'm already positive that if I can, I will definitely stay in Switzerland for more than 3 months). I only know that to apply for that I have to have a basic health insurance (+ accident insurance). They also pointed out somewhere that I should provide them with a proof of my active job search - I'm not sure whether I have to do this if I apply right after my arrival, since I wouldn't have any time to look for a job there yet. Could you help me figure this out?

- I'm currently unemployed and can't provide for myself using my savings (it's definitely not enough money for Swiss standards). Is it enough if my partner signs a document stating that he will be able to support me financially for the period covered by the residence permit? (His savings are enough to provide the basis for that)

- Should I translate all my documents / diplomas (university, CAE, etc.) to German, or is English enough? (I'm moving to the German part)

Just to make myself clear at the end - I'm not expecting everything to be easy and I definitely don't expect myself to land a great job within a couple of weeks. I did my research, on both Swiss and Polish sites, but some regulations changed, some are unclear and I don't want to make a crucial mistake and undermine all my efforts because of missing something or misinterpreting the rules. :)
