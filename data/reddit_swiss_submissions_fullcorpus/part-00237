I just typed up a long, polite post asking for advise on some hiking routes only for my notepad to hit close on the tab, deleting everything. So this post is gonna get straight to the point.

I'm coming to Switzerland on the 15th and I have 7-10 to backpack the Alps. I'm looking to hear from you guys on if the hikes will be work for my time period, any advise on what to see, where else I could/should go, and anything else you all can think of.

My route options are:

1. Zermatt to Sion to Gsteig via St Niklaus, Zinal, Nax, and Grand Muveran.

2. Grindelwald to Leuk via Kandersteg (for Eiger/Monch/Jungerfrau) 

3. Ferret to Saxon via Col du Grand St-Bernard, Bourg St-Pierre, Lac de Mauvoisin, and Verbier.

What do all you Swiss hiking junkies think? Any preferences, recommendations, or warnings?

First of all; I am from Switzerland. I am a (proud!) citizen but my parents moved to Sweden with our whole family when i was about 7 because of job reasons. I still speak fluent swiss-german and german, the latter might be a bit rusty though. Obviously i am fluent in swedish and english as well. I'm turning 18 tomorrow and have been thinking what i want to do after the swedish ""gymnasium"" which i have about 1 and barely a half year left off of and that's where my question comes in place;

I'm thinking about moving back to Switzerland for at least a year to work. My father has plenty of close friends all around the country (mostly the northeast though) who are willingly to let me live at their place until i come on my own feet. But i have no idea how the living and job situation actually is in Switzerland, nor how the adult life over there is. It's been more than 10 years since my parents lived there too so their information might be a bit out-dated so this is where you come in the picture, reddit! 

Questions:

What kind of jobs may i expect? I'm a healthy, young male who is willingly to more or less take on any jobs that i'm able to get. I'm studying natural science right now but it's what we call ""studieförberedande"" (more or less ""preparation for more advanced studies on university level""). 

Housing. Where is it optimal to live? How much does it cost, generally

Transportation. Worth getting a car?

Social life. I was a kid when i lived in Switzerland. I have no idea how people in my age are back home.

I can't think of any more questions at the moment but i'll edit my post if something comes to my mind. Appreciating any answers!

Hi, we just had a discussion in /r/sweden about the waste of food and the profit huge supermarkets are making. 

About a year or two back I read about how Switzerland lets people on welfare have access to stores which sells cheaper food.

For some reason Google turns up nothing right now and I'm worried I recalled the facts wrong. 

Is this currently in effect and if so, 

- can you tell me how successful/unsuccessful it is? 
- are there possibly any negative sides to this? unbalanced market?

Or was I mistaken?

So what does it do?

 it vaporizes herbs and concentrates, but i recommend using concentrate screens or it will completely gunk up everything. 

How does it work?

The vapman has a gold plated copper heating chamber, wich fits about .1gramms of ground up material. around the heating chamber there is a wooden ring and in between there is a heat protecting plate made of mica, a silicate mineral. the chambes has three little airholes that are connected to brass pipes. the entrance to those pipes lies on the mica, and when you heat up the chamber the mica gets hot aswell. That way you have a mixture of conduction and convection Vaporization, leading to a vapor taste superior to most other portables. by the way, you heat it with a butane torch.

The Build quality is really good, it is handmade by guys who previously worked in the clock industry

The flavour of the vapor is extremely good, it will taste the way the weed smells. The hashish im vaping right now has a vapor that smells like pine resin. 

The high is cerebral, refreshing. I can get really high after just one bowl, but then again im a lightweight. it feels really smooth and it almost never makes me tired, compared to what smoking used to do to me. it also feels cleaner. im not groggy like i am when im smoking. and the next day i don't feel a little weed hungover. 

Benefits to Vaporizing compared to smoking
i use less weed, i used about 7 gramms of flower and 1 gramm of hash in almost 3 months of daily use.
You can reuse the vaped weed for edibles or cotting out tobacco from joints
its really efficient, you ingest about 10-30% of the THC via smoking, about 30-70% via Vaporization.
