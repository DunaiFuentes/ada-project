My name is Josh, and My family is having their reunion soon. We are proudly Swiss, and love everything Swiss. I am looking for flags, cups, pins, T-shirts, Post cards, really anything to bring to the reunion. If you have anything extra lying around or know where to get any let me know, I am more than willing to pay for anything, and postage too.
My grandfather, Alfred Galli, who was the patriarch of the family passed in October 2011, without being able to see the land of his father. I promised him a few days before he passed that I would continue his legacy and try to get as much Swiss stuff as possible.
If you do send anything i would gladly share pictures or stories on how these things were used. 
The family reunion isn't until August, so it is a while away but i figured it doesn't hurt to get a head start!
Thank you so much for reading this.
Sincerely,
Josh Mayner

Never thought I'd get the opportunity to visit Switzerland (I am from UK) so I'm pretty excited even though I will most likely be working 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, but have a couple of pretty basic questions if anyone's able to answer.


For reference sake, I'm not a big spender, earn slightly above minimum wage in the UK. Don't work for a fancy company, they just need very basic help (extra hands) in Zurich for a while.


* I will be paying for my own food, which I can then keep receipts for and claim back. How much per day or week should I be thinking is an appropriate amount to spend on food? I'd be happy just getting a lunch and dinner from a supermarket most days, maybe eating out a few times. I won't have a kitchen, just a hotel room.


* Is going out for a jog culturally acceptable? I will be staying in the city centre, and don't want anyone to be affronted if I go for a run through the streets!


* In terms of plug points, as far as I can see any Euro adapter will work in a Swiss plug, even though the plugs are slightly different. Will I be okay with a European adapter or should I seek out Swiss ones?


Bonus question:


* My German is very basic. My French is pretty passable (but Zurich is German speaking obviously). My first language is English. However I don't want to be rude when I can't understand, or be understood. Are there any German phrases I could use to convey how sorry I am at not fully learning the language (I found out about the trip last week, leave this week) and apologize for my German being sub-standard. We have a quite young worker base (I am early 20s, I'm guessing most Zurich employees will be too) so I'm hoping they'll understand me when I run out of German words to say haha.


Many, many thanks!


 Also any hints/tips about staying and working for 2 weeks in Zurich would be great! Most information I can find are for tourists and hillwalkers, etc.
