Well, the title already describes my problem. I am unable to find a job in Switzerland. 

I am 21 years old and had my graduation as a trader one and a half years ago. I haven't had much job experience during and after my apprenticeship, which seems to be a major problem for me.

Also, I'm not specialized in anything like accounting, sales or administration. I made a bit of experience in almost every department but it's not good enough to work on a certain place.

I considered, that continuing education could always be very good for me. Sadly, I'm unable to afford it and no other person is willing to pay it for me. Besides, I still need the experice to be qualified for a job, so it's not an option for me.

I also tried working in a enterprise, which doesn't exist in real life (f.e. Bears Trading AG). But sadly, it didn't help me either, because some companies do not consider it as experience. Furthermore, you get less time to research, because you still have the duties within a company.

I'm also actively looking for an internship, because it is most likely to get a postive reaction. But my hopes have almost been demolished. I have sent my application to one of the biggest personnel offices in Switzerland. Unlike most of my applications, I have recieved a feedback, within four minutes. 

They basically told me, that my appreniceship is bought and no one would ever pick you with your low BEC (Business English Certificate B1). He also said, I should regret, picking this apprenticeship because it's overflooded with way better people than me...

So after sending countless applications, my only conclusion should be, that I will never find something and I could be homeless after a few months?....

Well, it is kinda an unrealistic scenario and possibly the worst one too. I mean, you KNOW something is wrong, when you couldn't find a fulltime job after such a long time, right?
