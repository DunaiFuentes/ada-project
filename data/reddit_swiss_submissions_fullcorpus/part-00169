I am here to ask you about Switzerland, in case that wasn't obvious enough. I know, posts about moving to Switzerland are a near weekly thing here, but bear with me. 

I simply wish for you to tell me all I should know if I were to move there, say, two months from now. That is, how hard is it to get a place to stay in Zürich and how expensive? What are the people like, generally? Will I need to perfectly know German, or will a good basis of German suffice for starters? What's the politics like? Is there good internet connection? etcetera etcetera

I have recently applied and interviewed for a position at a company in Lausanne, which I am really hoping to get.  However, I won't find out whether I have gotten the job until October of this year for a January 2015 start.  I am a Canadian citizen and because of this I feel a bit uncomfortable at the thought of having only three months to apply for a work permit, find a place to live, and arrange the move; however, I don't want to start these processes in advance to find out that I did not get the position at all.  I have heard that it is extremely difficult to find housing in Lausanne, and was wondering if anyone hear might be able to give me a ballpark timeframe for how long I can expect to be searching for a place to live so that I don't end up homeless if I am awarded the job position.
