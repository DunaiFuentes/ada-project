Basically what it comes down to is that when I'm applying for apartments (I look at every conceivable site for apartments, there is no site you can suggest that I'm not already checking) I always lose out on an application situation because I'm really undesireable on paper.

When I apply for an apartment the owner/rental company sees:

* I'm 18
* I'm a foreigner (USA, which is even worse because I'm non-EU)
* I'm a music student

And they say ""Next.""

I never get a chance to tell them: 

* I'm looking for a stable, long term lease (I would sign something for 4 years) 
* I have enough money in my own name to cover expenses (e.x. When you apply for a study visa your finances are taken into account, and my own finances were enough to get me a visa)
* In addition to my own savings, my parents are also supporting me

I can also offer the reference of another Swiss person to my future landlord (I have an ""under renting""/sublet/short term lease going on right now that's over at the end of February).

**What I need from somebody is a connection!** If you know someone who is thinking of renting their apartment, or looking for a roommate in Bern stadt PLEASE consider putting a word in for me! I'm willing to meet with you in person if you want to make sure I'm legit/a nice person before saying anything.

**I really really need someplace to live, and I'm having a lot of trouble finding a long term lease on my own because I look undesireable on paper.**

**What I'm looking for:**

Something in the CITY of Bern that is 700.- or lower (ideally). I don't care about the size, or the building. As for location, it would be nice if the area was around the HKB (my school)/Papermüllerstrasse/Kässernestrasse, but I will consider living anywhere in the city of Bern.

I am willing to go a bit higher on the price if it means not being homeless.

Please if you know somebody, or know somebody who knows somebody, consider meeting with me to see if I'm legit and putting my name forward. I am very desperate at this point, I don't want to be homeless =[ 

Obviously in the mean time I will continue searching. I am looking for ""regular"" rentals, renting a room (I would prefer an apartment of my own, but again if it comes down to it I'd rather live somewhere than nowhere), and student housing. Believe me my school has given me a huge packet of every company or website you could possibly contact to find someplace to live, so I don't need help in that respect.

What can we do about it? I'm no legal expert but I think this is legal for them to do. All we can do is put pressure on them by changing our provider or at least threaten to do so.

Each student has been assigned a country, and they'll do a basic report on them and make a poster showing a couple of the main details of the country. Then they'll follow along during the games and keep a running total of their country's medals.

So, I thought it might be a nice surprise for the kids if I could could create a slideshow of a few folks from each country holding up signs sending greetings to the student and the class. If the greeting pictures have any scenic countryside or landmarks in the background, that would be a nice bonus.

If anyone wants to help out, send me an e-mail at sirblah42@yahoo.com and I'll let you know all the details. Please let me know which country you're from, so I can let you know which student is assigned there.

I've received a ton of questions from people, so I'm going to try and cover the most common ones here:

**FAQ:**

**What should be in the picture?** Whatever you like, really -- if there's something scenic nearby that you can get in the shot, then terrific. If not, that's ok too -- the important thing is getting something in the picture sending greetings to the student (and the entire class as well, if you like). 

**Can I use an old picture?** Sure, several of the submissions I've received are of older pictures that people have photoshopped to add in a greeting to the class. That's perfectly fine! What I'm *not* looking for is just scenic pictures from your country without any greeting. I appreciate people helping, but the key thing here is getting a message of greeting to the kids.

**How long do we have?** The kid's projects are due in by January 30th, so if people could send them by the 24th, that will give me enough time to sort everything.

**Will we get to see the project when it's done?** Yes, certainly! All the pictures will be in an Imgur folder which the teacher can use to show the class. Once the project is complete, I'll be sharing the folder with everyone (and hopefully there will be a few ""thank you!"" pics from the class as well).

**What's a '2nd-Grader'?** A kid, about 7-8 years old, in their third year year of formal education (kindergarten, 1st grade, 2nd grade).

**Are you their teacher?** No, my daughter is in this class -- I'm just a dad with too much time on his hands who thought this would be a nice surprise for the kids.

**Didn't this post used to have all the details in it?** Yes, but some were concerned about the level of detail in there, so I've removed all information about the school and the kids. When someone e-mails me about participating, then I let them know all the details.

Thanks *so much* to everyone who has already helped out!

I really need your help. This is a very important question about my life.

**About myself:** I am a freshman at an Eastern European country. Major: International Economics and Finance.

Between school and university, I spent 3 years in different spheres: working in rural areas helping in innovation management, plus leading a large student organization and a start-up of my own.

I'm a non-EU citizen. I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, Russian and some French and basic Ukrainian. I can say I have near-perfect GPA and can get good recommendations.

**The Why:**
Because ultimately, being here I understood I cannot go too far. I am really ambitious and am willing to build my career in Banking/Finance industry. I have zero peers here who have any idea pertaining to this industry.
I am 21 already. I spent 3 years on working between school-college, and I want to graduate early now, and land a gig somewhere for professional development.
This is a 4-year university. I want to move directly to the 2nd/3rd year in a EU 3-year university. This means I can graduate early and focus on career growth + maybe MBA in the future.

I am quite poor but directly entering a university in 2nd/3rd year means I'll have to spend living costs for 2 years only before hopefully, landing a co-op or full-time job. Tuition fees in many public universities in EU is less. I can spend maximum 5,000 CHF. If you know of any undergrad grants/fellowships/scholarships etc that too would be awesome.



Please suggest and advice me and provide me with any details you have. This is a very important question for my life and I really need your help.

**TL;DR** I am searching for a university, where I can enter 2nd/3rd year directly. In English language. Bachelors. Economics/Finance/Business specialization. With scholarship/funding/grants opportunity.
