I searched for ""Switzerland"" and found [this cable](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06BERN898_a.html). Now I don't know if this was already known before, but there are a few things that caught my attention; such as what seems to be American lobbying in our media (paragraph 25):

&gt; 25.(U) On all the above substantive goals, official Swiss 
reluctance to engage more deeply with the United States 
stems largely from public suspicion of USG actions. 
Generally, the Swiss public is not energized about the 
terrorist threat; those who are tend to believe that 
association with America might only increase Switzerland's 
exposure.  Some Swiss do ""get it,"" however.  Mission's task 
is to work with these partners to spread the message that 
terrorism threatens us all and that spreading freedom and 
prosperity to the region is a long-term means to tackle the 
threat.  The large majority who opposed the war in Iraq must 
be reminded that we share a common interest in a successful 
new Iraq.  Those media outlets that have exaggerated USG 
faults have had their over-reaching exposed.  We will seek 
ways to help those sympathetic to our goals get the word 
out.


But what really stood out was this (paragraph 26):

&gt; 26.(SBU) As noted in the law enforcement section, it has 
been an uphill struggle to convince many Swiss authorities 
 
&gt; of the gravity of the current threat.  For many years, the 
Canton of Bern refused our requests to operate a 
surveillance detection (SD) team.  We have succeeded in 
reversing their decision and we should have an SD program in 
place shortly.  As noted, we are working to have our 
diplomatic security agents recognized as law enforcement 
under our bilateral agreements.  The coming years will offer 
a particular challenge as we relocate the Embassy to a new 
chancery. 


* First of all, what is a ""Surveillance Detection program"", why is it interfering in the cantonal competences, and what exactly did it do?

* Then, why are foreign security agents recognized (under what I presume is Swiss jurisdiction) as law enforcement?

The whole thing seems very borderline in my opinion 


**EDIT**: I looked for more stuff. So apparently, the US and Switzerland have a cordial relationship (at least up until 2010); however, the one thing the US seems to hate about Switzerland is it's media. Here a couple of examples:

[From 2007](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07BERN171_a.html):

&gt; 3.(C) The Ambassador carefully expressed his concern that the 
U.S. is constantly criticized in the Swiss media and only 
rarely is there recognition of the good things the U.S. does 
or that our two countries do together.  He invited Calmy-Rey 
to work with us to find ways to get out the good news. 

&gt; 4.(C) Calmy-Rey noted that Switzerland relies on 
international law and that is often the source of its 
differences with the U.S., Iraq and Guantanamo being the two 
most obvious examples.  She added that there are many areas 
where we are in agreement and usefully work together.  She 
referred to the MOU as a positive story that didn,t get the 
hoped-for media coverage, but cited the successful 
partnership between Switzerland and the U.S. on the MDA as a 
story that was reflected positively in the media.  She noted 
that, ""Switzerland can do things the EU can,t -- we can be 
useful in that regard,"" and added that Kosovo and Sudan were 
areas where our two countries could successfully work 
together and let it be known. 

[And here from 2006](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06BERN141_a.html):

&gt; 11.(C) Since the Washington Post claimed in early November 
2005 that the United States was operating hidden prisons in 
Europe, the Swiss media has gone full bore in identifying USG 
sins, real and imagined.  Any news on Guantanamo or Abu 
Ghraib is guaranteed front-page treatment, whereas Al-Qaeda 
attacks are relegated to the back pages.  Of particular 
concern is the issue of overflights by alleged CIA charter 
planes.  Italian prosecutors allege that a U.S. military jet 
traversed Swiss airspace on the day Milan cleric Abu Omar was 
kidnapped.  The Swiss government has repeatedly asked the USG 
to explain the flight and four charter plane landings at 
Geneva Airport.  Washington has yet to respond. 

&gt; 12.(C) Recently, a Swiss tabloid published a leaked Swiss 
intelligence report of an intercept of an Egyptian government 
fax.  The Swiss Federal Council has condemned the leak and 
its subsequent publication, and the government has launched 
administrative and criminal investigations into the matter. 
The intercepted Egyptian fax claimed that the Egyptian 
government knew of 23 Iraqi and Afghani prisoners transferred 
by the USG to prisons in Romania and other Eastern European 
countries.  Swiss officials apologized to Ambassador 
Willeford for the leak and for the press's overreaction to 
it. The Ambassador cautioned officials that Switzerland's obsession with the prisons/overflight matter -- driven in 
significant measure by Swiss Senator Dick Marty -- risked 
overwhelming Washington's perceptions of Switzerland.  Marty, 
acting in his capacity as head of the Council of Europe 
Parliamentary Assembly's Justice Commission and not in any 
official Swiss government capacity, greeted the information 
cautiously, but criticized the Swiss and other European 
governments for not disclosing information on the prisoner 
issue. 

In the same report, here's something very interesting:

&gt; Following 9/11, the Swiss agreed to sign an operative 
working agreement (OWA) with the USG permitting intensified 
information sharing on Al-Qaeda and allowing an FBI agent to 
sit in the Federal Criminal Police Counterterrorism Unit.
