Opening my own business in terms of multimedia. Nothing like the things you know - no 30 laptops ontop of eachother that are worth shit alone, more a lineup of a small number, but good laptopa/pcs/tv/hifi systems etc. Good services - plan an installation, male an offer, do it, install all your bought stuff, a ""clean"" service for manufactured systems(you know...clean all the useless software that come in pc's. Add in some we build it for you, some courses, a 24h emergency hotline for any of your problema etc. 

Now, before I plan any more - is there any group of people that would welcome such a store? I mean I have nothing against expanding it to other kantons if it grows.
