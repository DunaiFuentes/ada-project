My fiancée is of swiss nationality and currently lives there in Sursee.  Our plan is to marry and for me to move to Switzerland around July to August. The papers are processing as we speak, marriage papers have been ""ok'd"" so far.  But here's my issue and where I would need a little advice. 

I have been to Switzerland a few times for weeks, I enjoy it and I understand the cost of living there is much different . I don't speak German well but is learning. I'm currently a Truck driver here in America (Lastwagen) and was hoping there's a way I could at some point do the same there. But to be more realistic, how difficult would it be for a english speaker in Luzern (canton) to find work?  I know the importance of speaking the language, thus why I am learning to the best of my abilities. But if there are possibilities of such a job, where would I begin to search?

What are other options for work, as of then, I won't be picky as long as I can pay bills and live? 

I'll also add, I don't know the relevance of this, but I do understand I will be an immigrant upon arrival, and I know racism exists everywhere in the world. Would I have a harder time looking for work, being that I'm a black male?

We explored around interlaken and surrounding areas and fell in love with Switzerland. 

We are planning to come back October this year or December at the lastest. So far o think St Moritz looks like a place we would like to visit for a few days. Geneva is also another place we were looking at.

Our main reasons for going is seeing scenery: lakes, mountains and some hiking. 
Could you suggest some good places to visit in St moritz and geneva and/or any other areas that you think are worth staying.

Also we want to spend one night camping under the stars...somewhere we can witness the true night sky without light polution. We are not highly experienced campers so somewhere relatively easy to get to would be good.

However, a few people I met there told me that mastering walliserdeutsch would be impossible without being born there. How true is that?

I hope to stay there for longer, but if I ever needed to move to another city, that is not at the world, how useful would be the knowledge of this dialect? I know it is quite different from the language used in ZH or BS, but in reality, how big is the difference?
