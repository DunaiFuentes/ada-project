I thought I'd take a few minutes to explain how forwarding companies work, and why they're so very convenient. Keep in mind that my experience is based on using Shipito, but there are other options, of which I'd like to make a quick list before we begin.

- [Shipito](http://www.shipito.com/) (the one I use)
- [MyUS](http://www.myus.com/)
- [USA Box](http://www.usabox.com/)
- [OPAS](http://www.opas.com/) (this one also works with Japan)

Essentially, this is how it works :

1. **You set up an account.** With Shipito, you can either have a free account, with minimal services, or pay $50/year to get premium services like consolidation (they consolidate your packages to reduce overall shipping cost) and access to all their warehouses. The free account does not let you store more than 1 package at a time, only lets you store in their Minden NV warehouse, and does not offer consolidation

2. **You are given an unique address.** Store this in your address book, or better yet, make an entry in your browser's preferences so that you can easily swap to this address.

3. **When ordering an item from your US store, ship your item to this address.**

4. **Some time later, you get notified of your package arriving at the warehouse.**

5. **You fill out the paperwork.** You fill out the customs declaration, decide on a shipping method (ranging from slow but cheap Airmail to fast and expensive DHL 2-day). Shipito also has an insurance system where they will (if you want it) open your package, take pictures of all the contents, write down their value... so if anything goes ""missing"" on the way, they'll refund you the money.

6. **You get your package delivered to you some time later.**

That's really all there is to it. I've been using Shipito for the past year or so, and it's saved me quite a bit of money.

I am currently traveling to your wonderful country on a regular basis and there is one thing that deeply disturbs me: what the hell is wrong with your Döner Kebaps? Ok, to put things into perspective: I am currently living in Berlin, so my Döner standard is pretty high anyway and I have to lower it whenever I go anywhere else. I ate Döner a couple of times on different places in Switzerland and I found it always more or less inedible. I mean, what is so hard in making a decent Döner?!

There are two things which actually stand out in this awefulness:

1. They are always pulling the meat out of a warming box. What the actual fuck? I mean, why would you do this? Why not directly sliced of the Kebap? Why put it in the box so that it becomes soggy and unenjoyable?

2. They are offering only yoghurt sauce and motherfucking cocktail sauce and... thats it. Who eats that shit? Where is the garlic sauce? Hot Sauce? Maybe even curry?


Sorry, I really needed to get that off my chest. I really like your country but this... this is a dealbreaker!

I'm a German student, and I'll be finishing my Comp Sci degree in about a year. I wanted to move to Switzerland because of the better mountains. (2x the salary wouldn't hurt either ;) ). 

I have around 3 years of experience (as a working studen (part-time) at SAP + internships). Is the Software Engineering market in a good position right now? Good enough for landing a Junior Software Engineering job? Or should I get some experience and shoot for a normal position? 


Or should I forget about it altogether? I assume there is some offshoring happening due to the 20% jump of the CHF value.
