So I got invited to the MSc Research Scholar program at EPFL and I am supposed to pick 3 professors from the Computer Science Department who will get a chance to review my profile to see if they would like me to be doing research for them.

My interests involve parallel and distributes systems, and I am fascinated by GPU and heterogeneous programming using CUDA and OpenCL. I have done research at my undergraduate school where I am implementing a search engine on GPUs using CUDA so I am also interested in information retrieval. So far the only professor I have thought of is Christopher Koch, but that is only because of the information retrieval field. I would really like to work with someone who has done work with GPU programming, but I know that is rare. I haven't fund any papers from the Computer Science department involving GPU programming.

I will be visiting Switzerland in a couple of days on a business trip and will have a free weekend to explore Zürich and Baden. I am 25 years old and know a bit German as well. I will be travelling mostly alone.

I would be interested in any suggestions I can see around the cities mentioned above and/or anything interesting to try out. For example my colleagues suggested trying Rivella. Any advice would be appreciated.

Many thanks in advance.

   University of Toronto student here. I'm going to be studying in Geneva next academic year (my program is Political Science and Peace, Conflict, Justice studies), and I'd like to know if any of you have done this/ are going to be doing this/ have some commentary.
 
   As some background: I'll be 20, I work as a bartender here in Toronto (a cocktail bar, as opposed to club-style or corporate-style bartending), and I'm an active model UN/ debate kinda guy. I've been researching heavily and doing necessary repairs to my proficiency with French.

   Is there anything that you'd recommend I focus on visiting/ seeing? Also what might the benefits to studying in Geneva be in comparison to studying in Toronto? Finally, should I be looking for work?

Best,
