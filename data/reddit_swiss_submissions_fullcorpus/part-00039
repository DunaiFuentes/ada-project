i want to move to zurich and settle down there.  at the moment, im a midlevel corporate attorney (mostly handling mergers and acquisitions work) out of a top law firm in new york.  my ideal job in switzerland would either be for a corporate law firm there or to work for the legal department of a large company HQ'd in switzerland.  salary-wise, i'd like something in the 200,000CHF range (including bonus).  my wife is also a lawyer, but she mostly does international development work (i think her best fit in switzerland would be at the UN).  I have about 400,000 USD saved up. both the wife and i are fluent in german.  we're both american, however.

1)  how hard is it to find such a job for myself in switzerland?

2) what is home-buying like in switzerland?  is it more common to rent?  what are typical rents or apartment prices for, say, kreis 1 in zurich? 

3) as a foreigner, what's the best way to position myself to move to zurich?

basically, if anyone has any pointers about how difficult moving would be or whether this whole idea is some stupid pipe dream, id really really appreciate your input.  we really need to get out of the US.

thanks so much!

Edit:  if the job is to be commensurate with my experience, i should be making more 350,000CHF including bonus.  I just put 200,000 CHF as the ""worst case scenario"" for a corporate attorney with this many years in.",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,"want to move to switzerland, need advice",3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/r1bll/want_to_move_to_switzerland_need_advice/

I'm a 24 year old of foreign origin, I've been living in Switzerland for the past 10 years and I was wondering what I could do to start studying in here. I took a 3 year apprenticeship and now after working for 3 years I thought I would change my career and do something else. But unfortunately, the apprenticeship I took was not related to IT, does this mean that it's impossible to go to the university or do any higher education school?

I've heard about doing the Berufsmatura, but that alone takes 3-4 years to complete, by then I would be too old to start anything or do anything new. What should I do?
