I'm moving to Winterthur in late June so that I can start an internship from July 1st 2011 to August 31st 2012.  Is there a university district around that I could move into?

If not, what is the housing situation like? I would like to live with a roommate, but how would I go about finding one? Any particular sites or housing networks?

I'm looking for someone that would be available to ship a box of Giscard chocolate to Quebec, Canada. My mom found these 7-8 years ago and my aunt who used to live there always brought some when she came to visit. I know she really loves these and I thought it'd be great to use Reddit for such request.

Here's a link to the product page of their website : http://www.wuthrich.ch/fr/produits (it's the first one)

Now, these are expensive chocolate, I know they cost quite a bit, but I'm not quite sure of the exact price. From what I can recall, she used to pay around a hundred canadian dollars (maybe 85-90$ USD at the time). I'm guessing they are around 1$ a piece.

Reducing the size of the army, or even removing it altogether might also reduce cost, which is never a bad thing. 

There has always been a debate if the forced service is needed, and perhaps this event will be the tipping point. What do the rest of you think?
