Not enough direct human contact during the week and too much time spent at home are starting to affect my wellbeing. To balance things out I've decided to look for part-time work which would allow me to continue freelancing.

Ideally the work would require some level of physical activity (i.e. not sitting *all day*) and provide a chance to practice my limited German.

This summer I worked for one of the big open air festivals and loved it. I worked outside and moved all day, picked up a couple of new skills, met some great people, and got to see everything that is involved in making something like that happen. It's pretty remarkable.

Because I've been freelancing since a young age, or otherwise employed full-time, my experience with this sort of work is very limited. However, I'm a quick learner and open to try almost anything!
