Also, has anyone taken a tour at CERN? Is it worth it? Would it be too late to make a booking by now?

I'm quite interested in doing a masters degree in neural systems and computation at ETH/UZ.

As I will not know anyone if I come over to Switzerland, I would like to undertake the masters course with students around my age to give myself the best chance of making friends!

I do not know much about the Swiss education/university system, so I am hoping you could answer the following for me:

1.  At what age do students (who want to attend university) finish high-school?

2.  Do the majority of students generally go straight from high-school to university?

3.  How does the year of compulsory military/community service affect this?

4.  What is the average age that students finish their bachelors degree?

5.  Does the standard academic year begin at the start of the calendar year, or in the middle?

Thanks for your answers and advice - and good luck against Chile!
