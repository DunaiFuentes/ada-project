I'd say we meet at the Zurich Mainstation Group meeting point (it's in the middle of the big hall) at 18:00. You can probably spot redditors as  the ones drawing rage comics on the touch screen thingy there.

Then we could go to the niederdorf, grab a drink, something to eat and then just look where the evening takes us ;)

We could go to the blue monkey bar, which I just love (good scootch for a regular bar, cigars, and a pretty neat Mojito), but it's probably extremely packed on a saturday, so maybe cabaret voltaire? Cheap beer, interesting decor, agreablemusic for most people which isn't too loud.

Concerning food, it depends on how much people are willing to spend. the niederdorf is quite expensive and it'll probably be hard to get a table for all of us, maybe someone should make a reservation. I'm personally for [Papa Joes](http://www.papajoes.ch/zuerich/english/), [restaurant turm](http://www.bei-tony.ch/turm/) or that spanish place I never remember the name of. Or the [Kantorei](http://www.restaurant-kantorei.ch/), which hasn't that big of a menu, but makes the best damn club sandwich in the whole city (and a huge one at that).

Other options bar wise are the Widder Bar, which is a little uppity but has the largest whisky collection in the city (they have a ~10 page menu with only fine single malts). I just love me a scotch ;) And there's live jazz music every evening. The [Barfuesser](http://www.barfuesser.ch/) has a nice lounge as well with comfy couches (and good sushi, though that usually not a crowd-compatible food). I also have to mention the [safari bar](http://www.safaribar.ch/), as a friend of mine waits there from time to time and I love the nachos with cheese on top. That's the best spots I know of in that area, though tastes will probably differ ;) The jamie oliver pub is cool, but you'll never get a place as it's packed on a saturday (and nelsons or lady hamiltons aren't real pubs imo, as well as Jamce Joyce pub which is very expensive plus the service is bad)
