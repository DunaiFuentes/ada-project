I'm a student from the U.S who will be working in EPFL until January 1st. I don't know anyone in the city/area and would love to meet new people when I am there. I have a few questions though:

I'm going to be running the Lausanne Marathon in October. Does anyone know how fast this course is? If anyone in the area would like to run/train with me I would love that. Also any nice trails in the area that are challenging yet beautiful to run through? 

I'm also looking for the best places to visit over the weekends when I'm not working in the Lab. I love biking and running (as mentioned earlier) so I know that Switzerland is definitely the place to be. Any suggestions for small trips I can take? 

Funny thing is, I'll be turning 21 when I'm in Switzerland. I know this isn't a big deal in Europe, but as an American, it feels like I'm becoming a man! Again, does anyone know of any activities I can partake in that would be an awesome coming of age experience? It doesn't need to be that intense, but I've heard trekking from cabin to cabin along the Alps is an amazing experience.

Sorry for the barrage of questions, but I'm really excited for Switzerland. Final note, if anyone knows of places I can stay for the 5 months I'm there, please let me know. I've already scourged a lot of the sites, but people seem to be put off by me not knowing French... :/ I'm learning though!

This is a question that I wanted to clear up. My dad tried getting a Swiss Citizenship for himself but apparently ran into some trouble.
Here's some details:

My dad's mom is Swiss (born in Switzerland to a married couple and one of them was from Switzerland). My dad's dad is Brazilian. They got married here in Brazil in the 1930s. In 1955 my Dad was born while they were in Zurich. So he was born in Switzerland to a Swiss mother. 

When my dad's dad tried getting his birth certificate, they told him to get it in the Brazilian Embassy, since my dad's dad was Brazilian.

Is my dad applicable for a citizenship? If he is, would it be Jus sanguinis (descent), or would it be simplified naturalization? And if he was able to get a citizenship, would I be as well?

Thanks :-)
