Primarly I'm looking forward to do shooting as a hobby. I'm currently not considering to join a club or something, as I don't have a lot of time for that, but I got the opportunity to shoot with several guns at a shooting range when I was in holiday a few months back and I really liked it, so I'd like to start with shooting here, get better at it, etc.

So...

* As far as I understand, you don't need a special license or membership at a range to go shooting when you own a gun (besides the usual papers), right? So you just can make an appointment at a shooting range and go?

* What about the guns allowed at ranges? I know you can get a pump action rifle or a AK with the necessary acquisition permit here, but I can imagine most shooting ranges are specialized on pistols/simple rifles?

* Are there any courses (maybe even from the police) where you can actually train how to handle a weapon - instructed by professionals?

* How about joining a club (if I got time in the far future): What is the usual process?

I have 10 years experience and has in that time worked as a contractor/consultant.

A week or so ago I got contacted by a what could best be described as a British Headhunting company that had seen my Linkedin profile where I keep my updated CV, mostly for fun.

Basically the offer was at start 12 months with up to 24/36 months, in the field I am most proficient with for a Global Financial organisation in Switzerland. The pay would be starting negotiations around 1000CHF/a day (but no paid holidays or semester due to the high pay - I am coming back to that point), tax at 15% ( and I need not to pay tax in Sweden! woop!)

I asked a few more questions, and got back a few more details like I would work through a Swiss Intermediary that he (the headhunter) would use for payroll and back office functions, workdays would be mon-fri, 09.00-17.30 (and due to the work load sometimes out of hours work), also being put into project lead role was mentioned so far.

So…

1000CHF/day - After scoping around what people seem to earn in Switzerland, it seems really high… I would more or less in 2 months time make more than I do now in a year. If it sounds to good to be true… you know.

Intermediary? is this a thing? Found little to no information about this being a thing at all reading on guides to working in Switzerland.

How are employers in Switzerland. Could they just terminate me after a few weeks and say “lols, sorry, go back to Sweden and your damn weird polandball comics - not our problem you have a rental contract that costs ASS (yeah I checked, seems like 1500-3500CHF a month to rent a flat depending on your standard) so just go back with a huge dept.

I have a first phone/skype interview tomorrow, but I guess if they are interested they would like to meet in person.

Should I just walk away from this or should I at least entertain this and see where it leads me and wait until I have all the information I need before making a final disition?

(seriously though, dat cash… I would be debt free and could swing by Germany on the way home and pick up a nice GTR - which happens to be on my bucketlist)
