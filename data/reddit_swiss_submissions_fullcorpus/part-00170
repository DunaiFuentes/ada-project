Please ask questions if you need any other details to answer the following:

* How much of the gross ~4200 CHF/month would be cut? (and by cut I mean tax and any other legal stuff I might be unaware of)
* Are there places to park the car for free? (even if it requires parking in the peripheries)
* Is it legal to own a car with a foreign plate and foreign insurance for 1 year?
* What would you say is an average monthly rent for a 1 bedroom/kitchen apartment?
* What would you say is the average monthly bill? (gas, electricity, water, internet/tv)
* I can cook, I like to cook and I want to cook. If anyone shares this, can you roughly estimate a monthly cost for food?

I live in the Lucerne are.  Been here for about five months.  One of my favorite activities with my wife is to go camping.  Our favorite holiday ever was in the Canadian Rockies, where we rented a car and drove to remote campsites between Banff and Jasper (some with running water as the only amenity). We would stay at this site for a few days and hike around the mountains and glaciers in the area before moving to the next site. It was exhilarating.
From my research so far, it seems that there are not many (or any?) tent-only campsites in Switzerland.  We don't really like campsites with massive RVs, restaurants and satellite dishes.  I understand it is also forbidden to camp outside of campsites.  Can anyone advise on their experiences? My wife and I would like to go camping next month on our vacations, and would be willing to travel far for a nice camping experience.
