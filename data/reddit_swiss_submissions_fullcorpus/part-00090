The prompt is to write about the linguistic policies of a country with a focus on the policies of the school systems.  I'm having trouble finding sources for the scholastic part. So to get some ideas, I thought I'd ask people who grew up with a Swiss education. 
What is/are your first language(s)?  Does that language correlate with the region in which you were raised?  In your primary/secondary schools, did you study another language (or in another language if at a bilingual school)? How do schools decide about which languages to use? Has the government ever tried to promote multilingualism on a large scale or is it primarily up to the cantons (or to the schools)?

Thanks! And sorry for all the questions, when ever I am finished writing one, I usually have three more. Any answers (or links) would be much much appreciated.
