My girlfriend and I have decided that we'll travel to Geneva for a couple of days in February, because she's on holidays and I'm a freelancer, so I might get some work out of it. There are a couple of problems, well, not problems exactly, but still.

We're trying to keep it as inexpensive as humanly possible. It's half of the concept of the trip. So heres's the question: Where is the cheapest place to stay? We're cool with pretty much anything as long - and that's her requirement - as it's a room for two.

Also, here's my big question. About ten years ago, I lived in Geneva for a while. I used to go to this amazing milkshake place. It was located just after the big bridge. You'd turn left and walk for a couple minutes. But, granted, that was ten years ago. Does this place still exist?

While we're asking about things still existing. The American Supermarket that sells Jones Soda. It's still there, isnit it?

**EDIT:** The hotel situation has resolved itself. I have discovered a site that lists lowest rates for hotels, so I'm now staying in a four star hotel that runs cheaper than the youth hostel. It's in the Rue de Berne, which people seem to think is a bad part of town. I've seen worse parts of many towns, so this is glorious.
