I am in my last year of Gymnasium, and, as you might be aware, each student needs to write on a project in order to take the final exams. 

Mine is looking into the political interests and information sources of youth in Switzerland. A large part of my project should be based on a survey. And this is where I need your help: 

Would you please be so kind and take 5 minutes of spare time to fill in [this google docs survey I wrote](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xfQ2SLmGGxh3k407jRZi36pKgECniHQFT3G9219Ve9U/viewform?usp=send_form) to make my project possible? 

Since it is about youth, I would humbly beg any Redditor between 16 and 26 years of age living in Switzerland to help me. If you are under thirty, please simply indicate '26' as your age. If you are older than that, you might want to consider helping by sending this link to your children or younger relatives/friends of under 30. You do not need to be Swiss citizen in order to fill in this survey. 

Unfortunately, the survey is only available in German. If get enough requests though, I will write an English version of it. 

Please do feel free to aks any questions you might have here, or also via PM. Thanks again, even if only for reading, and I see you around!

EDIT1: I will upload an English version asap

A month ago I made a post looking about moving to Switzerland - which I'm loving - but I'm kinda going crazy because currently I can't find any job. I delivered - for sure - more than 100 CV's and so far nothing. I probably got something in Thun in October but I'll only know in 2 weeks. My pocket money is getting tight and if I can't manage to find something quickly I'll destroy all my savings - to keep me going and able to travel by train to find a job .
Do you guys recommend me anything?

No, I don't speak German. I do speak a little bit of French.

I worked in Music Agencies, a Web TV channel as a Producer and other stuff , in Wall Street English in the Costumer Care Department and I've done lots of summer jobs - from cleaning to construction.
