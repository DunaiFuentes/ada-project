I am looking into leading a group of high school students on a week-long vacation to Switzerland in early March 2012. I have been to Switzerland once before, spending time in Zurich, Zermatt, and I believe Lausanne. This was years ago with just my dad, so a different sort of trip.

What would people suggest I do with 10-15 students and 7-8 days in Switzerland? What are some fun adventures or worthwhile educational tours/outings? What cities are the best to hit? (I would probably do 2-3 nights each in 3-4 cities rather than a whirlwind tour of a different city each night). What is the weather/temperature like in early March? Anything at all would be useful!

Thanks!

I have, however, several doubts and questions. Mostly about the differences in lifestyle, but also about prices and such.

I am probably going to make the trip in my own car (as I want to have it over there to visit different cities or even cross the borders to Italy, France or Germany every one in a while). How does car insurance work in CH? I've also read something about ""transferring"" my driving license to the Swiss system, but that's not at all clear. Also something about a ""toll sticker"" for the Autobahn, which is also not clear.

As for accommodation, I'll start looking into my employer's list of private apartments/rooms for rent, but I'd like to know if there are any online sites where people post their apartments for rent.

Also, and just out of curiosity, how much can I expect a pint of *decent* beer to cost?

I'm very good at what I do, and I am a conscientious, generally nice bloke. I got here two months ago, after dropping out of university in the UK to move here. Previously, I had been doing a lot of independent security research and conference organizing. So, I'm a highly motivated guy who is very bloody good at what I do. 

I have been renting a room in an apartment from a former UN worker, along with two other guys. All has been fine, and I have a great rapport with the guys. We all respect each other, treat each other well and have a great deal of consideration for each other. Everything has been fine, but the landlord has shown a huge amount disrespect and unethical behavior to the current tenants, including:

- I live in France, and I need a housing contract to get a bank account and register with the Maire. This guy has refused to give me a contract, saying that he doesn't trust me. Regardless of whether he trusts me or not, it is still the law for him to provide me with a contract under French law (I am a Frontalier). 

- He didn't ask me for a deposit, and then one day, asked for one, knowing that it would be impossible given that all my cash is in the UK, and I don't have anywhere to transfer the cash to. 

- He has came home in fits of rage, and accused myself and the housemates of conspiring against him. 

- He has taken up the living room (which is open plan and can be viewed by the kitchen) as his personal quarters, preventing myself or any other housemates from using it. Which means we either have to eat our meals on the balcony, or in our bedrooms. 

- He constantly condescends both myself and the other housemates, saying that we are stupid and uneducated, and generally acts like a colossal prick to me. 

I'm at my wits end right now. I didn't leave the UK to be treated like this, especially by a useless prick with his head lodged so far up his arse, he could lick his own pancreas. 

Either way, I need out. Anyone in the Geneva area know anyone with an affordable room to rent, immediately? If I live with this shithead any longer, I might have to go on a crotch punching spree through the Grand Rue.
