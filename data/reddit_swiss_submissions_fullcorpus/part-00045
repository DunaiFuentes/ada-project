To the psychologist, who fought I was mentally retarded and tried to have me interned.
To the 5th grade teachers, who refused my mathematical results because I was using other methods than the ones mandated or who refused to punish a kid who broke two of my teeth and left my face scared for life, because ""I provoked him by taping him on the shoulder"".

To all the students who bullied me for never speaking, not defending myself and wishing to be left alone. And to the teachers, who let me be attacked with tazers in class and stabbed with knifes in front of the school.
