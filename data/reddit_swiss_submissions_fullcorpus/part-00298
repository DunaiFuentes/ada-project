Amazon Sellers often don't ship to Switzerland. But for some products, there are other sellers that do! It costs more, but it's very often still a lot less than in Swiss shops.

So, how do you do it:

- Find product
- Below the price, there's often the text that the seller does not ship to Switzerland, and below that there is a small link ""5 new for $##"" - click said link and find another seller. International Shipping costs are usually a good indicator for international shipping availability.
