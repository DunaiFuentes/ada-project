----

I recently returned from my trip to CERN and Geneva - amongst the historic Old Town, the expensive centre, and the beautiful Lac Léman, Rivella was part of the greatest experience I have had in my entire life. It would really mean a lot to me if I could have it here (sadly, after their failed introduction in 1998, they are no longer sold anywhere in the UK).

Thank you to all who even consider!

Today I thought about why there isn't already a political party somewhere in the world formed by redditors (well, there's /r/orangered and /r/periwinkle, but that's another story!) and I came up with a few reasons that are pretty obvious (we're not that many, not everyone is interested in politics etc.), but this unique form of community (the *hive*) would be somehow the perfect basis for a political movement.

Consider this:

* **Posts**: Posts acts similar to suggestions, opinions, request for comments    or final political point of views. They can be used to form paroles about a certain topic or initiative.

* **Votes**: Redditors vote. We express agreement or disagreement with a single click making it easy for everyone to take part and set a statement.

* **Majority decisions**: The more votes a comment gets, the more important it will be for the majority. Same with posts: Highly rated posts should be considered as urgent.

* **Circlejerking**: No big deal here, politicans do that all the time.

Now, what about presidents and the voice of minorities? Here comes the political system in play we already have here in Switzerland. As long as an opinion doesn't get the absolute majority of votes, it isn't considered as final. Also minorities have the possibility to call out a referendum. And for party presidents as well as representatives: There won't be a single individual but rather a group of 5 - 10 people elected directly by the redditors.

This may be a silly idea but who knows? There are other small parties outside not represented in the parlament and there are also many individuals without belonging to a party. Everyone has a voice in this country and I think this could work because we're all connected somehow through this little site where we misspend most of our work time.",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,default,Swiss Reddit Party (a.k.a.
