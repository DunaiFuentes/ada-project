But how does the west work? How do you live, how do you think about your neighbours, Röschtigraben, Switzerland, France, Europe, ...? Is there music just for the romandie or even linked to a specific canton/dialect like Mani Matter, Breitbild &amp; Co? What do you watch when the north of the country turns on Tatort or Giacobbo/Müller?

Who should I ask (any big thinkers/cultural represantatives?) or what places should I visit to get an idea of the Romandie? What can I read/watch/listen to? 

What are good history sources about the perspective of Romandie on history? I'm sure there's another look at Rütlischwur, Guillaume Tell, Napoleon, Dufour, etc. than I got teached.
