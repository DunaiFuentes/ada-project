- contacting the Federal Chancellry, which I intend to do next week. maybe they can then offer EPUB files beside the existing PDF files

From there we will get on the ferry and head to Bellagio. 

Some questions I had were:

What bus station should we be going to once we get off the Wilhelm Tell Express?

What bus should we be trying to get on to get to Menaggio?

How long is that bus ride?

How far is the ferry stop from where the bus from Lugano will be dropping us off?

And finally, is there a better route that we should consider?
