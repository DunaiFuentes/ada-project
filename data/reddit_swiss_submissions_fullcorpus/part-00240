Now, it's a long trip. So for a beginner like me there's a lot of things to learn before going.

 1) I heard about visas, passports, and all those, what do I need exactly to be allowed to even go in South Korea?
 2) There's hundreds of sites whose purpose is listing flight prices, would you recommend any?

I live in Lausanne, VD. Today I received [a letter from OFFICE DES POURSUITES on behalf of BILLAG SA](http://imgur.com/Qup65ZO). I am not from EU so I don't understand French much but from what I understand I need to pay CHF (169 + 35 + 33 + 5) at the Billag office as a tax for using TV and Internet. 

The problem is I used to live with my friend at some place A (from August, 2013 to October 2013) where we had internet + cable + TV connection + apartment contract under my name. During that time we payed the tax to Billag. Then we both moved to different apartment that is at place B (Nov, 2013 to present) where we have internet + cable + TV + apartment contract under my friend's name. While moving we both updated the address at cantonal office. We also cancelled my Citycable contract for internet + TV during that time.

Do I need to pay this amount as I am not using internet + TV? or Did I need to change the address with Billag when I moved because of which I received this letter. Can someone explain this to me? Thanks.

**EDIT**: Does someone know if it is mandatory to inform Billag about the change of address, or is it enough to just update the address at the cantonal office?

Also, I didn't understand what amount is payable as per the [letter](http://i.imgur.com/Qup65ZO.jpg). Is it 169 + 35 or 169 + 35 + 33 + 5?

**EDIT2**: I am not sure why I received the letter from Office des Poursuites. I didn't receive anything from Billag to pay in the last year.

I was hoping someone could enlighten me as to any particular route you know of, or you have done yourself, in which the hiking trail conveniently intersects camping sites at reasonable distances between.
