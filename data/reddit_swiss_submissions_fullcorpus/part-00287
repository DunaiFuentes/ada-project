In short, it's just a quick summary of how my attempts at social interaction with Swiss youths went during my brief visit to the country.  Below is the text, I hope it's interesting.*

[Previous thread was here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/39vy7l/are_quick_hookups_a_thing_in_switzerland/)

So if anyone's interested, I finished up my time in Switzerland, having spent time in Montreux and Interlaken.  The general responses from the last thread seemed to be rather pessimistic, but to hell with that!  I thought I'd give it a go and see what happened.

Suffice it to say, I got bupkiss.  I don't know if it was because of what people had mentioned in the previous thread, or because I was a foreigner in tourist-heavy areas (and didn't speak much French or German) so they wrote me off right away, but I couldn't manage to get anywhere past pleasant conversation with strangers, and even that felt rather awkward and forced most of the time.  

I'm not saying they were rude or anything, but the feeling I got was along the lines of, ""Why are you talking to me?  Do you need something?  What can I do to help?""  Guys were sometimes a little more receptive and open to chat (at restaurants/bars), but the women were universally curt.  Then again, I was mostly forced to either strike up conversations with service personnel or strangers in the restaurant/on the street, and from what you all said before, that doesn't go over too well in Switzerland.  Bottom line, I couldn't even edge my way into a steady conversation with anyone, let alone try to become more intimate.

I ended up spending most of my social time with other people at the hostel, which was comprised of other foreigners in my situation (new to the country, unfamiliar with the area/people), which gave us a bit of camaraderie to bond over.  The people from the hostel were also the only people my age who I found at the bars, but perhaps that was due to location more than anything else.

All in all, I still had a blast, and aside from things being more expensive than I anticipated (eating out was killer on the wallet), I would love to visit again.  Hopefully next time I can find a Swiss pen pal or something, so that when I'm there next I can get a head start on integration.
