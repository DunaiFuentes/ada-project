I hope you guys don't mind me posting here. 

My Macedonian girlfriend recently started working for a TV company that sells subscriptions to Macedonians in Switzerland. It includes a whole bunch of channels in Macedonian. She's been having a tough time selling any because she has been supplied with a list of numbers that have been phoned over and over again. So you can imagine the people on the other side are rightfully annoyed and upset when they are phoned again. Others have been selling to friends, family and so on. She says some of have even resorted to chatting up their customers. So you can imagine neither of us want that. It's the only work she could find and she has been looking for a long time and if she doesn't meet her targets they will let her go. So I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions on how she can reach her target market?

I should mention that I know *some* German but am also aware that Swiss-German is very different from the German that Americans are taught in school.

I see three ways to create a wonderful place for Swiss people here on reddit again:


1. Reinforce the rule that questions about (travelling) Switzerland have to be submitted to /r/askSwitzerland and delete posts breaking this rule here.
2. Create another subreddit for Swiss Germans only, so foreigners won't come there. I know there are four official languages in CH, but there's also a /r/suisse.
3. Create some kind of wiki page (travel brochure) and link it where everyone can see it (eg. sticky post) 


Please share your opinions on this subject. I'm looking forward to a good and respectful discussion.


If there is a demand for a Swiss German sub, please let us know!


Edit:

It seems that 1 and 2 isn't very popular, which  is very comprehendable. Resolution 3 is actually already in work, but I think we need to get this going a little bit faster. 

What was also a very good suggestion by a user was that we should post here more content to make the faq threads show up less and less annoying.
