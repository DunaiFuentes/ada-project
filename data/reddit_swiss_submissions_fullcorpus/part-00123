Which city is most remote for early season skiing and offers most variety? I have a vw golf registered in Norway, is it a difficult process to bring it in to Switzerland? Anything I should know about the schools, cities, nightlife etc. before applying?

Just a little heads-up for those of you who got the PS4 today or will get one soon. MediaMarkt (at least the one in Crissier) is selling all PS4 games (except the collector's edition of Assassin's Creed) for 69.-. That's 20.- to 30.- less than Manor for example. I was told that those prices were in place only until monday, then they would go back to the usual 89.- or more.

That's all. Hope it helped someone.",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,default,Little heads-up for swiss PS4 players,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1rpb7q/little_headsup_for_swiss_ps4_players/

We've already paid for flights, we've booked the hostel (85CHF for the weekend) and booked a nice restaurant for the Saturday night (~50CHF).

We're going from Friday night to Sunday night and will be going out on the Friday and Saturday. We also need food and perhaps a little spending money (though I'm not a big one for souvenirs).

I don't know how much money to take, and I don't want to run short or be left with loads when I come back. I really want to know:

* approximately how much is a beer/wine on average in a bar?
* do clubs charge entry fees and if so, how much are they on average?
* do you have any recommendations for good pubs/bars/clubs or things to do in the daytime? We are staying fairly central I believe.

Many thanks!",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,default,How expensive is going out in Zurich?,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1rpe8j/how_expensive_is_going_out_in_zurich/
