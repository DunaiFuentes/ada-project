It's more of a discussion, and I'd like to see if there is a commonly accepted ""best canton/s"" in CH.

Personally, my dad is from Aargau (fluent in german, and basically fluent in french and italian now), while my mom is from Bern/Valais (fluent in both german and french). I grew up in Vaud and so french is my first language (along with english considering I did my entire education in it), and I speak decent german.

That being said, I think I'm relatively unbiased. While it's hard, I'm gonna say that the best canton, in terms of beauty, kindness of people, fun, standard of living etc... is:

Vaud/Valais. 

While yes I grew up in Vaud, and a lot of my family is from Valais (as well as from swiss german areas), I don't feel like I'm picking these two because of bias. I feel like Vaud is just an incredible place to live. Probably the best standard of living, international, surrounded by the Jura and Alps, next to the lake, and close to Geneva. On the other hand, Valais is next to none in terms of nature, it has that southern hospitality feel, good weather, great skiing and more. People who have family in Valais (specifically the french side) will know what I mean, but there is that different feeling than anywhere else. I don't mean it in a bad way, but there's that redneck feel, where if you go into a village with a foreign car plate (by foreign I mean another canton lol), everyone will stop and stare at you, and you'll see an old lady stare at you from a window behind a curtain haha, people inviting you to have a drink in their cave which makes the whole experience kind of intimate, especially when you're in a small village hidden in the mountains.

I requested them to remove the picture (I didn't ask for compensation or else, just removal), proving I was the owner (by sending high resolution sample, other views, matching exif datas...). 
The only answer I received were insults and threats, and of course they didn't comply. They told me that none of my emails would be replied anymore.
So, I contacted the web hosting company for a mediation, to let them know about the infringement.
This infuriated the Swiss company that contacted me back, insulting me again (to fuck off, quoting them ;) ), requesting a picture of my ID beside the object I shot to prove I was the owner, within the next 24 hours, or they would make me huge troubles. 
This is irrelevant as I was complaining about picture copyright only, not object ownership. So I didn't reply.
Their last message was another flow of insult and threats. They now started to stalk my online life (the forums I go to, etc...) and are now going full speed to smear me, as they promised to do so.
Kinda weird, knowing they are in fault, and I never entered their game of insults and threats...

I'm frozen on money because my money can be traced from the people following me.
