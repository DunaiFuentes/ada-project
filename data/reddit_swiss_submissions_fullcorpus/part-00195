in 1990 Switzerland had over 200000 unemployed citizen which represented 7 percent. 1990 was considered a normal crisis unlike the subprime crisis of 2008. 

in this case where are all these unemployed people? . probably the are not registered,  left the country, went back to study or registered  as invalid (you can see them drinking beers all day in bars after becoming ""fin de droits"" or becoming ""bouton d'or"" (when the residential town take care of the unemployed person after 2 years) 

unemployment offices make it harder and harder to register.  it's at no surprise why unemployment is going down. just a myth! 

if it was true,  Swiss people would have not voted ""yes""  the 9th February 2014, instead  they would have said welcome to everybody to take Swiss jobs. 

the"" true"" unemployment rate  is around 20 percent, same as the USA. We can easily guess that the Swiss  dices are loaded in favour of left political class and foreign industries who have moved to Switzerland to pay less tax.

these foreign industries are installed near  the Swiss border and hire their own non Swiss worker. they do not spend their money in  Switzerland as they go home after work and spend their money in their country during week end. (they don't go to Swiss restaurant,  hotels,  theatre,  pay no Swiss VAT, they just buy Swiss fuel because it's cheaper in  Switzerland and some avoid   highways to save on the 50 Swiss francs sticker. 

foreigners are paid much less and work more than  42 hours/week. I have seen workers being paid 1200 francs full time.(Switzerland has no minimum salary) 
All grocery shops and hotel/restaurant  positions are filled by non Swiss. 
French cross the lac Leman  by boat every day  to work in Lausanne. 
Geneva is simply invaded by French (frontaliers) 

When a  Swiss guy applies for a job in his own country,  his resume go straight  to the bin, this  has nothing to do with xenophobia,  but I think it's time that Swiss citizen take control of their country before to see Switzerland  being destroyed by the 20-25 percent  immigrants who kill  roads and infrastructures  and make life of Swiss people miserable  (rent,  food,  insurance price is going to the moon). 


I'm just upset by the Swiss situation because Europe should be better than Switzerland to get a status quo position regarding its Flux of immigrants (Swiss going to Europe,  Europeans going to Switzweland) it seems now European citizen needs Switzerland more  than Swiss need Europeans . 

 it's easy to guess that if Europe don't fix their problems now,  in a few years Switzerland will be totally invaded by European workers and wages will go lower and lower as these same Europeans will compete each over for the few jobs remaining.
