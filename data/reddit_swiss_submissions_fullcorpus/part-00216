On Christmas’ eve afternoon, our internet router died. This meant that our landline phone, Skype, Facetime, emails or any other way of communicating with friends (and of course all the rest if you are slightly geekish) over the Christmas period was disappearing.

In a hurry, I rang up our service provider Swisscom.

The help desk person didn’t ask me any stupid question (like “ *I* *am* *sorry* *Sir*, *but* *if* *you* *don*’*t* *use* *the* *red* *ethernet* *cable* *we* *provided* *it* *cannot* *work*” which I was actually asked in the past by one of their competitor) but listened to me explaining that I checked the voltage of the power supply, the cables and that it would still not turn up.

Instead, the help desk technician told me that the router probably was dead and the only option was replacing. 

After a 5 second pause, he told me that there would be a spare router available for me 2 km away in a coffee shop (I live in a small village) and that I would get a text message on my phone within 5 minutes with a number allowing me to exchange the router at the bar.

Result:

* 45 minutes later I had the new router in my living room
* 1.5 hours later everything was back in order (including all the port forwarding for the security cameras…)
