I’m a 17 year old Swiss and French binational and I live in Neuchatel. I was born and grew up in Switzerland, and only have the French nationality because my grandmother, and my mother after her, was French.

Of course, I’m starting to look into my military obligations. Since I’m a binational, I have the possibility to opt out the traditional swiss military service and choose to make the French « Defence and citizenship day », one afternoon devoted to talking about the military and what soldiers do.

That would be the easy way out. If I decide to do this, no more military obligation for the rest of my life.

However, I’m starting to doubt about doing this, mainly because a lot of older people I talked to seem to have enjoyed the military service, found that it was a « school for the adult life », had the possibility to visit the « raw » country, and still take pride for having been in this or that corps. 

I’m not a particularly athletic person I guess, but I like to jog and play tennis, and some football once in a while. I like the country and I do not have particularly expensive tastes. I don’t really know what other info I can give about myself, so ask away if there’s anything you’d like to know !

So what could you advise me ? What were your experiences ? What are the pros and contras ?

Thanks !
