This IR would be arriving at 12:30 and there would be no more trains to Baden afterwards.  They set up 2 taxi drivers to pick up the 9 of us in Zurich.  These were fully paid, and they dropped us off right outside our apartment.



So hats off to SBB for their amazing service in this situation.

I am in need of an apartment from (around) the 1st of November until February 2013. I am looking for something close to Zurich, 10-15 km from the city is just fine. And I need something that is not too expensive (price range 1300-1600 chf).

I am from Macedonia by the way, 24 yr old. I'll be there with my wife and my 3 year old son.

So any help is greatly appreciated :)
