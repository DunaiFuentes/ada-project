I've made a bet with my girlfriend that I can find an apartment in Geneva better/faster than she can. Given that nearly all the redditors I've met/been in contact with so far are decent and nice people I thought I'd give it a try to see if it's possible to find someone here on /r/switzerland to help me out. In return you'll gain a good friend and many perks that go along with that.

I was wondering if some of you redditors perhaps could help me out?

To make a long story short(er) we (a small family of three) are moving to Geneva as my GF has been granted an internship at the WHO headquarters this autumn (1st of August until 1st of October 2012). We're both academics, in our late twenties, speak sufficient french and are fun and open minded people (or so we like to believe ;) ).

I would very much appreciate if any of you perhaps know of any not too expensive apartments for hire, has a place for us or just could point us in the right direction since you're probably more in the know.

We don't demand much as to m^2 and have about **1800-2000 CHF +/-~200 CHF** to spend on rent per month.

My GF always is on my case why I like reddit so much, she doesn't see the point, I'd like to show her what she's missing out on.. so thanks in advance fellow redditors!

**TL;DR: Need apartment/a place to stay in Geneva August 1st 'til October 1st, max ~1700-2000 CHF/month. Can /r/Switzerland help a fellow redditor out? Will bring you a narwhal as gift of appreciation**
