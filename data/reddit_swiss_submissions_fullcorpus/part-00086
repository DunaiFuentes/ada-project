As many of you will know, race tracks are forbidden in Switzerland. With the Strassenverkehrsgesetz getting more and more restrictive and no places to really use fast cars and motorcycles, I think there are a lot of people who would like to take their vehicle to a race track and speed legally and professionally.

Sadly though, this is not possible as of today. Multiple attempts to get rid of the old law proposed in 1955 after the Le Mans crash have since failed.

As a motorcyclist myself, I would really like to be able to do trackdays in Switzerland, as even the nearest tracks outside of CH are at least 3 to 4 hours away.

My question is, how can we achieve this? How can we prove to the public and the lawmakers that race track safety has evolved greatly since the mid-century? We even had our own F1 track, think about that!",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,How to legalize race tracks again in our country?,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1c1ui9/how_to_legalize_race_tracks_again_in_our_country/
