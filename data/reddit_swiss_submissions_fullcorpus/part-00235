I would love to switch out some of its tools to trim size/weight from my camping gear.  I understand how the shape of the base of one tool effects the spring tension of its partners so some things need to be placed together.  For example, I love the smooth feel of the large scissors but can't get friendly with the parcel hook.  SAKWiki states ""since the hook was introduced they have always been paired together on 91mm knives.""  I wonder if anyone ever tried to round the base of something else to make it work.

I would like to trade the corkscrew for a phillips and that seems pretty straight forward.

Might as well replace my bent long knife.  Not interested in serrated edges so I suppose the originally equipped spear point tip is the only option.

I'd like to remove the wood saw; it's just too small since I have a good Fiskar saw.  That would remove a whole layer and spacer but I see the Mountaineer replaces it with a metal saw/file so that's something to think about.

I feel it would be nice to trade the bottle opener for an awl but consider this; on the Trail Guide the SMALL knife is replaced by the bottle opener.  Since the bottle opener and the can opener are the same width, if the spring shape would allow might the can opener share a layer with the LONG knife?  I could remove another layer there since I never have any bottles and rarely use the small knife.

With some changes to other items I take with me I could drop a whole pouch from my gear and lose a few ounces.  To add something here is a youtube video showing where the needle is stored. [Secret Swiss Army Straight Pin?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibPFXISgsic)  It's silly but I never noticed I could add a pin to my knife.
