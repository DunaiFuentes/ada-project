I’m an American student on a study abroad in Spain. I have some family in Bern and I’m planning on staying with them over the winter break roughly from the 17th of December to the 8th of January. I really want to snowboard while I’m there. I don’t have any equipment with me, so I would have to find some way of borrowing or renting some. I wanted to post incase anyone wants some company in Bern.  To snowboard with or just hangout. I’m mostly into all mountain boarding, not really doing crazy park stuff. I’m good enough to keep up, but not do back flips and what not. I know there was this thread on advice of where to board near bern. So that’s a start. http://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/khhva/going_to_be_working_in_bern_switzerland_this/

Do you guys have certain important or monumental environmental policies/programs that contribute to Switzerland's environmental status? An example for the US would be the Clean Air Act (http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/), which is supposed to alleviate pollution levels.

I find this topic to be very interesting, so any feedback would be fantastic.
