As you’re certainly aware, our political system consists of three separate forms of power (Legislative, Exekutive, Judikative). I’m going to talk about the legislative power.

We like to brag ourselves about how direct the democratic system in our beautiful country is. And, yes, compared to most other systems and countries we did quite well, indeed. If you think about it, though, it isn’t that direct at all. Do you have any idea of what the Nationalrat or the Ständerat is talking about and deciding during their sessions? Maybe you do, but do you have any direct influence on their decisions? Or do you have a possibility to make your own proposals in a way that’s just as simple as it is for any member of one of those councils? You don’t, because of the simple fact that you’re just not there. Yes, you elected them to be there for you, so you don’t have to. And yes, that’s also because you’re just not interested in concerning yourself with every tiny detail they’ve got to deal with. That’s just fine, but it’s not a direct democracy.

In a truly direct democratic system you could bring your ideas and concerns into every subject that’s being discussed just because you care. In a truly direct democratic system you could make a proposal of any kind at any time, again, just because you care. This doesn’t mean that your proposal gets accepted, but it’s gonna be discussed by people who also care, at least about that specific subject. You see, the key is people who care about specific subjects. That’s exactly the issue with our current system. The elected parliament has to care about everything, even if they actually don’t care. The public doesn’t have to care about anything, even if they actually would care (doesn’t apply to elections and votings).

So, why do we have a parliament? Because somebody has to make decisions and it just isn’t practical to have millions of people talking and debating together - or is it? Ever heard of the internet? Ever been on reddit? Exactly. Millions of people talking, debating, hating, loving, even voting. And all these people are split up in thousands of subjects they actually care about. I hope you can see the connection here.

So why don’t we retire our representatives and actually take the fate of our country in our own hands?

EDIT: Formatting, grammar

EDIT2: Thank you very much for your replies, your suggestions and concerns. It's great to actually be discussing the topic here.

So I would really like to live in Switzerland one day for all the obvious reasons and then some. I've dedicated the next three years of my life here in Stellenbosch (South Africa) to learning German (Unfortunately I have no way of learning Swiss-German right now) and doing a plumbing apprenticeship. I am told plumbing is a job in demand in a lot of places in Europe, am I right in assuming its in demand in Switzerland as well? I know the laws to do with work visas are hectically against me which is why I'm hoping plumbing is the right way to go?
