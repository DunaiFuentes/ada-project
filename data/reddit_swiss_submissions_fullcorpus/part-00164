I'm amazingly stocked and want to go watch Edge of Tomorrow on the 9th or 10th there.

Looking at this link: http://www.pathe.ch/fr/film/21309/edge-of-tomorrow/schedule

Is it true that on the 9th there's an English showing at 6:30pm and on the 10th there's one at 9:10pm?

Also, has anyone been there? How is it? Is there any information on the screen size?

Finally, I gather from the website that there are no numbered seats, you can't therefore select your seats when you book online? I can't get the java thing to work right for me at the moment, is there no other way of booking (short of calling)?
