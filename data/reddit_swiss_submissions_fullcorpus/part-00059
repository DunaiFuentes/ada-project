They are pretty noisy and never respect the Nachtruhe principle, since they don't work they usually wake up at 6 o'clock in the afternoon and stay awake until the early morning. I've talked to the guy that lives in that apartment, which he's also the hauswart from our building. He simply says that it's not him and that he doesn't hear the hammering and loud talking through the night.

I called the landlady and she doesn't believe in me or any of the other two tenants that also complained about the noise and she's backing up the new guy/hauswart when it's him that does all the noise.

He's also suppose to clean the stairs and do maintenance which he doesn't do at all, so we have been living in a filthy apartment block, the stairs are covered with dog hair and stink of wet dog. I also told this to the landlady and did photographs, she doesn't believe in me. I even visited her since she's unable to walk and see the building by herself, I talked to her about the noise and lack of cleanliness, she immediately called the new guy and he told her that it wasn't true, again, she believed in him.
