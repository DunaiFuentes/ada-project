First, a little bit of background. I am a physics and math major at my university and I am almost done with my undergraduate (I graduate in May) and am in continuous search of what I should be studying for graduate school. I really like physics and mathematics. I find myself often reading article about particle physics or about CERN on Reddit and thoroughly enjoying. Unfortunately, I do not always fully comprehend the true depth of the research. And thus, oddly enough, the birth of my curiosity. I really think all that stuff is fucking awesome and I'd love to be in the position to be in a fancy lab doing this awesome stuff. Thus my need for some guidance, what do I need to study to be in that position? What should I be expecting? Anywhere you suggest perhaps? Some insight? How about the story as to how you got to where you are presently? Anything really. I am painfully curious and would love to hear from you.

This came as a bit of a shock and a surprise. First of all, I wasn't aware of the way the fire departments are organized in Switzerland, so I had no idea something like this would be dropping in the mail someday. Secondly, the tone of the letter was quite strict and coercive so to say. Now I can speak and read German just fine, so I can google my way out of things eventually, but to give you an impression of my wtf moment I'll quote one line (in German)

&gt; Gestützt auf diese Grundlage [FwG] sind Sie per 1. Januar 2015 in der Feuerwehr engeteilt und verpflichtet, aktiv Feuerwehrdienst zu leisten. Um Ihnen die Feuerwehr und Ihre zukünftige Tatigkeit näher vorstellen zu können bieten wir Sie hiermit auf, sich an nachfolgenden Datum zum Einteilungsrapport im Theorieraum der Feuerwehr einzufinden.

So here I am. Just started a new job, and now what. I have to do active duty in the fire brigade? How does that work out? I decide to google, and find out, this is apparently the way it goes in smaller municipalities where the fire brigade is organized as a militia from volunteers. I also find out that I can choose not to enlist and pay 2 promille of my taxable salary per year as Feuerwehrsteuer. This, by the way, is not mentioned at all in the letter.

Now here's the deal. While I kind of dislike the tone of this letter, I do like the fire brigade. I'd actually like to do something for the community, I find the work interesting, and love to make new (Swiss) friends and acquaintances. My question here is: does anyone have experience with Feuerwehrdienst? Is it any good, did you like it? What are the practical implications? Do you have to be on standby at any moment? And how about the language for example? I'd love to hear your experiences, since it is not something I can seem to find thoroughly documented on the interwebs.

**A little about me:** 28, female, trader for a financial firm, MBA, US citizenship only.

**About my move:** I would already have a place to live.  I hear it can be difficult to find reasonable housing without already living there, so I'm glad I won't have to worry about it.  Most likely the move would be long-term, at least a couple of years, if not permanent.  I would have to get a job prior to the move, my company will not be relocating me.  I'm learning German, but it's a slow process for me.

**Questions:**

* Any Americans here that have relocated to Zürich that can share their experience? 
* How difficult do you think it will be to get a job that will sponsor my visa, considering I am a foreigner and not from the EU?
* How important is it to be fluent in German (or French) to secure a job (specifically in finance would be helpful, but any thoughts are appreciated)?
* Finance specifically - I am Series 7 and 63 licensed.  I know those won't carry over, but is there additional licensing I would need to get?
* Any suggestions on companies I should look into?

Thanks in advance! I can provide more details if necessary, and I'm sure I will update with more questions as I continue through the process.",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,American moving to Switzerland (Zürich),0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/2k0px6/american_moving_to_switzerland_zürich/

&gt;In parts of Switzerland from 1640 to 1837, mayors were chosen randomly. This was because political office could be used for financial gain; the argument was that everyone should have an equal chance at this. 

They don't provide a reference for it though. 

Does anybody knows anything about this ? My guess is that this would have took place in Swiss German states that were closer to democratic ideas, with the Landsgemeinde.
