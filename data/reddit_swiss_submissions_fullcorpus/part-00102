this is something that's always kind of baffled me.  

I'm one of those cranky people who wants their elected politicians to be accountable to voters and to justify their votes.  

I have to confess that I never figured out - what is ""standard operating procedure"" for voicing support or opposition to certain laws under discussion in parliament, or certain ways of voting?

Our Nationalräte have email addresses, but as they're grouped by canton (as [here, for ZH](http://www.parlament.ch/d/organe-mitglieder/nationalrat/mitglieder-kanton/mitglieder-nr-kanton-zh/Seiten/default.aspx)) and we do not elect people by district (or do we, and I have just never realized this?) I'm a bit baffled as to what we, as voters, do to tell our politicians ""hey I support / oppose xyz please vote this-and-this way"".

The last time I tried this I lived in Zug and sent my representatives who'd voted for a ban on ""violent video games"" a really nicely worded mail with studies, precedents, statistics, etc., asking them to consider changing their positions, and got one fairly snotty ""go away kid, you bother me, you have no idea what you're talking about"" reply.

Is contacting these guys something ""we"" normally do?  Is this something the parties handle?

Spent most of my time in the past around the glarus canton and engelburg (generally). Think I'll have any issues with hutte reservations if I planned around the jungfrau area? I've been before, but never around the hutte system there.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. I typically love drooling over making such as plan myself, but it's more difficult than I expected on my mobile to pull the resources I need.

Me and my gf are Israeli. I work as an engineer and my gf in import/export of dangerous materials. 

Currently the life in Israel with its massive government intervention in citizen life makes our life quite hard. I cannot imagine EVER owning a house of my own even though we both work. The only way is to be in debt for the next 30 years at least, basically being a slave for the bank or government ""benefits"" if you are a proffesional moocher.

I absolutely LOVE switzerland and my visit there last year made me love the country even more.
We decided a few months ago that we want to make a life there (here for you I guess :) ). We are studying German in the Goethe institute in Tel-Aviv and quite enjoy it. Although when I hear Swiss-German I cannot understand a word. 

The biggest concern for me is how the hell do I find a job from abroad. I cannot afford first moving to Switzerland and then finding a job. I have to find a job from Israel, if that is even possible. I posted my Resume in monster.ch and even applied for two jobs- got rejected two days later. (Hey, at least they TELL you you didn't get the job unlike here where you get an answer after a few months or usually not at all).
I can have a Romanian passport because my grandparents are from there, but I am not sure its a sure thing.
I simply LOVE the economic freedom in Switzerland that leaves the US and almost any other country far behind, and Israel far, far behind.

I really hope we are able to start a life in Switzerland. Actually, I feel like my life is now ""frozen"" until I will arrive at this place where people can actually work and save money to allow them to live, and not just survive, or at least not give half of their earnings to the government.

I'm soon 35, I hope I am not too old to start the process.

Well, that's the end of me whining. I really hope to succeed!

If there's anyone here that managed to find a job in Switzerland from abroad, please share some tips.
