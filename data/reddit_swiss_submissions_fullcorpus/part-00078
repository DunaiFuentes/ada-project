I have a few concerns among the topic, and archived threads where not clear enough. Before i will ask, here is a little about me. I am making master in German Institute (embedded IT, DSPs, micro controllers) looking to graduate in June. My university is polish aswell as my origin. I got married last year with an non UE. We are young and looking forward to settle in Swiss. I speak fluently German(but im not one) and a little of Russian, no French/Ita, my wife fluent English and A1 in German, and has Ukrainian diploma.Therefore:
#0) First find the job and then a place or first find the place to live and then look for a job? Is it common to get interviewed through internet/skype? It is a little hard to just go to Swiss and have an 1/2h job interview.

#1) Where to look for a job (i don't mean the sites, it was listed before ty), i ask about where to aim for settlment?  Which region would you recommend and why?

#2) Is it common to live in Germany and work in Swiss? Or its better to not bother at all and live in Switzerland? I ask because of the house prices, and the tendency to not buy the flats/houses. Hence the next question.

#3) When you are renting the house, is it common to settle in this place. Like rent for your whole life? Is there any 'insurance' that the owner won't tell you ""Your time has come"". Who is the owner of the rented places? Are these some kind of companies or private persons?

#4) Final and most important for us. I, as an UE citizen, would get an permit visa for stay as I would find a job (there has to be no other willing Switzer for this position afaik)? But what about my wife? Marriage is made in EU. She is an Ukrainian citizen, therefore how could she live with me? Because if i will leave my EU homeland and move to CH, How would she be able to stay with me when her hitherto visa expires? Could I ask the Switzer government for a visa for her as a wife of working foreigner?

Any antowort is well appreciated.

In a recent survey many soldiers stated that they do not really see how their service should be useful to the country - even if the army provides for many some good experience (btw, for all who do not know, Switzerland has still a draft system).

I agree with this perception and as a citizen I feel it’s unacceptable to spend about 3.8 bio CHF every year (http://www.vbs.admin.ch/internet/vbs/de/home/documentation/zahlen/armee.html) + extra costs for certain equipment such as new fighter jets, for an army that is obviously outdated. Furthermore, I think there is at the moment no serious debate how to align the army with the threats of the 21st century.

That is why I would like to ask you for input and the idea is to contribute to furthering the discussion – you may provide your ideas and opinions. Thanks!

Update:

So I sat there in front of my hostel for 3 hours.. then realized I had their number on my ticket.. (I blame the fact that the cold was getting to me) 

I got on my laptop, excepting to use google voice to call the number (as my phone had been stolen 2 weeks ago in Spain) and I found out my laptop wasn't turning on. 

Luckily there is a free hotspot outside of the hostel (how I made this post in the first place on my ipod touch.. 2nd generation..) so I was texting my friend back in the states and I got them to call the hostel, give them all my booking information, and around 5:30 they gave my friends the pin code to enter the hostel and I was able to enter the hostel and find that they had put my key in a little mailbox for when I did show up. 

Thank god I had an ipod touch... however slow and terrible using google voice through a BROWSER is because the dedicated application no longer works on my ipod.. because it's too old. 

Haha but it's alright. I fed some seagulls and went in a handful of museums and now I'm gonna chill out, have a cigar or two and a few beers.",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,Plea for help in vevey,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/18xdzj/plea_for_help_in_vevey/
