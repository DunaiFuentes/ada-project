Someone sent me a package with weed from Holland. The package seems to have got caught by police as I received a letter summoning me to come to the police station.

I'm Swiss and I live in a German speaking canton (dont want to be too precise here). I  think I could pass a drug test as I havent smoked in more than 3 weeks.

So I plan on denying everything any involvment. What do you think about that ? I want to play ignorance but I would be greatful if you could tell me how you'd handle that.

Ideally, if you are familiar with swiss laws, do you think it's better to play the addicted guy that needs help (they will send me to doctors and all the stuff I guess, but no judge) ... Or the I don't have a clue and hope they drop it cos of lack of proof ?

Thanks for your help, would be very appreciated.
