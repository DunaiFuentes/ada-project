I'm currently hiking the Via Alpina across Switzerland and will be finished on 30 July if all goes well. I have to go back home on 4 August and was thinking to explore the area near the Matterhorn/Zermatt a bit as I've never really properly hiked there.

I'd like to camp/bivvy at high altitude on the trail (I've been doing this along the Via Alpina and as long as it's above the tree line and not in a protected area (http://respektiere-deine-Grenzen.ch) it should be fine; if there were farmers around I usually asked permission first and they never said no). So I was looking for something a bit more secluded than the popular day hikes (I know it's Zermatt and everything is likely to be pretty packed, but relatively speaking)

Here's what I came up with so far:

-Europaweg from Zermatt to Grächen (2 days): I heard with the detour around the suspension bridge near the hut, it's not that interesting though. I heard of some hikers just ignoring the closed sections anyway and that the view was incredible, but a bit hesitant to do that myself since it seems dangerous...

-Walker's Haute Route from St. Niklaus to Zinal

-I found something on the Zermatt website called just Höhenweg which seems to be linking a bunch of different trails together: http://www.zermatt.ch/en/Media/Planning-hikes-tours/Hoehenweg


Has anyone done any of these trails before and can recommend them? Or maybe suggest some hidden gems in the area? On the Via Alpina, the most amazing parts were not necessarily the well-known passes in the Berner Oberland but the less-traveled sections e.g. in Glarus and St. Gallen where I could bivvy and enjoy a sunset/rise from high up :)

My family and I have just moved to Switzerland from the US, and we are looking to get health insurance in the Zurich area.

For the most part the basic and supplemental insurance options seem straightforward, but we are unsure about the hospital supplemental options.  Some people have suggested that paying for a private or semi-private room also affects the quality of care you receive.  In other words, perhaps you get access to better doctors and more sophisticated treatments in a private ward.  Other people have disputed that.

So, is it just a matter of personal comfort, or does the private / semi-private status in a hospital really convey a different standard of care?

Also, as we are still learning German, are there health plans and facilities where English might be more prevalent / supported?  Hopefully, we won't need to use a hospital anytime soon, but if we do it certainly would be nice to be clear about what is going on.

I looked around for similar posts (and in r/askSwitzerland) but found mostly questions about single persons so here I am....

I just received a job proposition for an IT position in a bank in Geneva. Without giving too much details it is an Administrator job for specialized technologies.

Here is my situation:

1/ I am a EU Citizen married to a non-EU Citizen. Two young kids (less than 5 years)

2/ I have a Master in IT and about 10 years experience in the technologies related to the position (positions is pretty much an exact fit of what I can do and have been doing for my whole carrier)

3/ My Wife has a MBA but almost no experience it its field and again, non EU Citizen so from what I read it is very hard to find a job in Switzerland apparently.

4/ Job salary for the offer is around 120k per year (before any taxes)

5/ We apparently must be residing in Switzerland for visa purpose (so no cross-border residency in France or Italy for cheaper cost of living etc.)

6/ We live pretty frugally where we are now, do not go out much (young kids are not the best for restaurants and such) and can go by with ""normal"" lifestyle etc.

Rentals seems expensive in Geneva for family housing, I know medical insurances add quite a bit of overhead etc.
But I do not have much idea if that amount of money is ""ok""

Has anyone experience/advice on cost of living for a 4 people family in Geneva (or working distance of it)?
Keeping in mind that at least in the beginning I would be the only income for our family (until we sort out the situation for my wife).
