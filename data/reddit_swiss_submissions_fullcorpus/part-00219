Is there any way to get unlimited traveling for 22d/1m now?

I'm currently applying to become a Swiss citizen because my grandfather emigrated from Switzerland, my family and I have close ties to Switzerland, and my Swiss heritage dates back to the 1500s. Because of this, I'm very interested in learning Swiss German. I understand that Swiss German is only a spoken language and all written material is in High German, however I'd like to learn Swiss German because, please correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I've read though most Swiss will understand if you speak High German, you'll be more welcomed and treated as more of a Swiss if you can speak the dialect. Specifically, I'd like to learn the Bäsel-Stadt dialect as that is the canton for which I am applying for citizenship, however I doubt I'll find any resources that specific.

I'm wary of books because I don't think I'll be able to figure out the pronunciation properly so I've turned towards tapes/courses. The only programs which I've been able to find are the [Pimsleur set of MP3s](http://www.pimsleur.com/Learn-Swiss-German) and [this software off of Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Instant-Immersion-Level-German-Download/dp/B005IHVWIY), so I was wondering: does anyone have any experience with either of these or recommend another? I'm not looking to become fluent and I understand that this is unrealistic living in the United States, but I'd at least like to learn the basics. I suppose another approach would be to use one of the myriad programs for leaning High German and then watch a lot of Swiss movies, news broadcasts, etc., but I haven't found many of these (other than the classic Die Schweizermacher). Please let me know what you think or if you have another method which worked for you.
