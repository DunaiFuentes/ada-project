There is one racist hoax going around the internets in Slovakia and since I have not yet seen it busted, I have decided to do that myself. I however need your help to confirm my findings.

The hoax goes like this:

*I came back from a 6-day study trip in Switzerland.*

*""There are many Roma here, but as you can see, they actually work very hard"" Renata, a city councilor and the owner of 2 hotels, explained.*

*They have this motivation:*

*Unemployment benefits only after 5 years of uninterrupted employment.*
*Refusing a job offer - no benefits.*
*Losing your job because of your own fault - being absent, drinking in the workplace - no benefits.*
*If he destroys a city flat* (note: a flat rented to socially weaker/poor people by the city, not sure how to translate) *he needs to pay for it or go to prison and work the payment off.*

*blah blah blah more racist bullshit blah blah blah*

I googled a bit and this is what I found out:
- You only need to be employed for at least a year in the last two years in a company that pays unemployment insurance
- You need to be actively seeking a job, provide relevant paperwork, etc, but I heard it's not that strict.
- The bureau doesn't care about the reason why you quit a job
- No idea:)

So, can anyone please confirm or correct this? Thank you!",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,Help with correcting racist hoax about the Roma and the Swiss social security system,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/o9ldd/help_with_correcting_racist_hoax_about_the_roma/
