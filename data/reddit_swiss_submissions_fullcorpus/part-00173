My bernese is 5 and for the past couple of weeks he has been a nightmare at night. He won't stop panting even when he is outside ( it's a cool, calm night) He has went through about a litre of water in the past two hours and has had 2 meals today.


He keeps basically sitting on me and pawing me looking to be petted, he's sitting on his hind legs and won't lie down with constant panting.

He does have a lump on his back which he has had for about 3 years and the vet declared it as a cyst.


He isn't gagging or being sick and his gums are a normal colour.

He has a brother so I can't see him being lonely.


Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.",false,SwissMountainDogs,t5_2vu9g,null,null,self,"My bernese is panting, restless and begging for attention at night.",4,http://www.reddit.com/r/SwissMountainDogs/comments/2b34zt/my_bernese_is_panting_restless_and_begging_for/
