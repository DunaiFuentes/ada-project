1. How do you fit your paper money in your wallet? The bills are too fat for my wallet.

2. Nothing is open on Sundays, and everything closes early. Nearly starved to death if it wasn't for a 24 hour Coop I found.

3. Is the store ""Coop"" pronounced Co-Op or Coup? 

4. Am I the only one being fooled by doors? It is difficult to tell whether a door is push or pull, making myself look stupid on a lot of occasions.

5. Everyone speaks different languages, yet people still find a way to communicate effectively. It is awesome.

6. The whether is bi-polar. One second it is sunny, the next second it is humid, thundering, and pouring rain.

7. EVERYONE DRIVES HATCHBACKS.

8. Do Swiss people normally drink from the faucet? I'm guessing the water is much cleaner here than in the USA, but it is still odd for me.

9. Water from the faucet gets extremely hot/cold very fast. I love it.

10. Everything is expensive.

11. People do not seem to like eye contact here. Am I just creepy?

12. Do people here play beer pong?

13. I've asked for water at restaurants, but had to pay 5 CHF+ for a bottle when I simply wanted tap water. Oh god. I also bought a giant pack of sparkling water on accident. Bullshit!

14. Everyone here is so skinny. I have yet to see a fat person, and it makes me sad.



And that is about it. Most people I have encountered have been very friendly. This is a beautiful country and I love it here.
