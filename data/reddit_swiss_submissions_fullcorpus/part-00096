But where exactly is SUSY hiding, how are we looking for it, and why haven't we found it yet?

Theorist John Ellis and experts from [CMS](http://cern.ch/cms) and [ATLAS](http://atlas.ch) –– the two general-purpose detectors at the LHC –– will answer these questions and many more from you, **in a little under 2.5 hours**, as part of CERN's weekly outreach series, **Hangout with CERN**.

Each week, we answer your questions about CERN and its research. If you have any SUSY-related questions, send them in in comments below and we will pose them to our experts!

More details on the [Google+ event invite](https://plus.google.com/events/cj5jh1b2vhlkniuvlhk56g13ino).

The webcast is at 17:00 CEST (see [current local time](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=87) in Geneva), and you can tune in on CERN's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/CERNTV) or [Google+ page](https://plus.google.com/+CERN).

I've read some run-downs of people's monthly and annual expenses, and while some are self-evident (groceries, rent, utilities) others I have no idea what they are (someone mentioned Pillar 3, which I initially thought was a tier of health insurance but they then mentioned health insurance as well, leaving me stumped).
