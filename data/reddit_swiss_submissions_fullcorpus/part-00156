As the title says, I'm wanting to move to Switzerland at the end of the year. I currently live in the United States. I am a software engineer with 3 years of experience at this moment. I did not finish college due to the fact that I accepted my current job position before I graduated. I am a native from Bosnia, and lived in Switzerland from 1992 to 1999. I wish to move back to Europe to be closer to family. I can speak high German well, I'd definitely need to brush up on it quite a bit. I've forgotten swiss German however. 

I have read quite a bit online about this process and what to expect, but I'd like to hear from some people who are familiar with it firsthand.

So, my questions are:
1. Am I going to have a hard time finding a job out there without a degree? This is my biggest concern!

2. Anybody who has been through this process: how long in advance should I start looking for work?

3. I've heard that recruiting agencies are the best way to find a job in your field. Is that true?

4. Any websites such as monster.ch that you would recommend?

Any other tips would be greatly appreciated!",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,"Wanting to move from USA, hoping to get some info.",1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/24bnew/wanting_to_move_from_usa_hoping_to_get_some_info/

I'll be doing the cms (course mathematic speciale) this fall, because I only have la maturite professionelle and I was looking for a room. I found this site (http://fmel.ch/en/). I applied on the first day they opened registration for fall 2014. How high are my chances of actually getting a room? Should I be searching for another room in case I don't get one? The epfl website has a link to an internal house/room search, but it seems like I need a login to access it.

And lastly, does anyone have a room for one year who might enjoy the company of a 19 years old male with an apprenticeship in IT (doing a lot of coding) who doesn't cause much trouble except ocassionally ranting about how slow the internet connection is?

I have found a nice place to live in Lugano, but the contract situation with the apartment seems a little tricky to me and was hoping to get some different viewpoints on it.

The contract has three names on it A, B and C. Now, A wants to leave the apartment and the country, but still needs his name on the door for a few more months (maximum until October) to receive mail and whatever. He is subletting his room and I am interested in it.

Now, since A cannot cancel the contract for his reasons, and I need a place to live in, the agency owning the apartment has offered to make a declaration that I have permission to live in the apartment (without an ending date, and nothing else) starting from May 1. The original contract however would still remain between the original parties, until A decides he no longer needs his name on the door, at which point a new contract will be drawn up with me, B and C as the lessees.

Do you think this is an acceptable solution in legal terms or am I just setting myself to get in trouble at a later date?

Thanks for any response
Best
