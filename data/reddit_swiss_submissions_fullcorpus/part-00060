my fiance and I are planning a Honeymoon to Switzerland.  The time of year would be March.  We want it to be cold, snowy would be nice, but not entirely necessary.

I don't know anything about switzerland, not even sure if you can find snow in March... we pretty much threw a dart at the map to pick our destination.
