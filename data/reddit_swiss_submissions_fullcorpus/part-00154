This is basically a slow paced day to recover from some jetlag.

**Day 2**: Lucerne - taking the boat across the lake to Alpnachstad, cogwheel up to the summit of Mt. Pilatus, then on the trip down, taking the gondola and stopping off at Frakmuntegg to do the Frakigaudi luge, then back into Lucerne.  I have no idea how long all this takes, so I don't really know if I have a ton of time left over after this excursion.  Thoughts or suggestions here?

**Day 3:** Train to St. Moritz.  Staying at the Kempinski Grand Hotel des Bains.  Plan on taking a stroll around the lake there, exploring Dorf, and maybe just doing some spa/massage/gym type of stuff at the hotel.  I'm just in St. Moritz for the day and one night.  ***Anything I can't miss here***?

**Day 4**: Taking the Glacier Express from St. Moritz to Zermatt.  Booked a first class ticket on this and plan on bringing our own food to eat while on the train.  Arrive in Zermatt, staying at the Hotel Chalet Schonegg.  Plan on just kind of exploring the town, maybe seeing the Matterhorn Museum, eating a veg. meal at Old Zermatt, or getting a drink at Sparky's.  Possibly a visit to Hinterdorf for exploring.  Pretty wide open for suggestions on this day! Overnight in Zermatt.

**Day 5**:  Zermatt, again.  Taking the cogwheel to Gornergrat. On the way back down, stopping off at Rotenboden Station to hike and see the Riffelsee lake, then back into Zermatt.  Any thoughts or add ons to suggest here?

**Day 6 and 7**  Heading into Interlaken.  That is just our home base for the time, but don't really plan on spending much time there except for sleeping.  General plan is on day one to visit Murren/Gimmelwald area, and the second day to see Lauterbrunnen and Trummelbach Falls.

**Day 8** : Heading from Interlaken into Geneva, maybe go to CERN or the UN, then departing back to the states the following day from here.  Staying at the Eastwest Hotel.

One crucial thing is that we're going to travel completely via trains (well except the start and end obviously). So therein lies some of my questions:

1) I'm debating between a Swiss Pass and a Swiss Flexi Pass. We're going to be there for 14 days (and probably will require a train about 11 of those days). We're four and my brother and I are under 26 (barely) so the Swiss Pass offers a discount for us. Which one would be a better bet? I felt like Flexi would be, but it doesn't include scenic trains (and I'm going to take the Matterhorn Express and trains to Jungfrau, Pilatus and Titlus). And a whole bunch of museums in Geneva. Thoughts?

2) We're definitely taking the Glacier Express from Zermatt in addition to the Mount Pilatus railway and the Jungfraujoch rail. I know the Glacier Express is not covered by the pass (and the other two may not be), so do you recommend we book it in advance (by months) online? Or just show up to Zermatt and get four tickets?

3) Where do you all go to lookup how long a train journey takes? Is Google Maps reliable? I looked up Zurich to Lucerne and it says take ""IR train towards Luzern"", which should take ~50 mins. I'm not sure what IR means and if that's correct.

And one last question about language. I have very basic proficiency in French. Would I offend anyone if I used French in places like Zurich or Bern? If so, I'm also planning on learning some German (in addition to a phrasebook) but let's be honest, I'll be bad at it. Is it better to attempt that basic German and then say ""Ich spreche kein Deutsch""? Or just start off with English?

Thank you.
