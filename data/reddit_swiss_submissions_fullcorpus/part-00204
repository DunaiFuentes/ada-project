My mother is a teacher of Russian as well as Estonian as a foreign language, she has diplomas and certifications from the best university in Russia, as well as 10 years of teaching experience (sometimes freelance and sometimes worked for the best university in Russia, clients included top-ranking execs and even the ambassador of Kuwait to Russia).  

She is also fluent in Estonian and semi-fluent in English and has an EU permanent residence card, and she currently lives and teaches Russian in Estonia because there is no work to be found for her Russia.

I've been trying to find a nice place for her, I want only the best for her, and it seems that Switzerland is a very good choice. She is a very hard worker and is not afraid of long hours and low wages.

Is there any chance anyone here would be knowledgeable about this subject? Perhaps suggest a place to look?

I moved to Switzerland last February and am Irish but have also American Citizenship. As a result I am thinking about working with a financial advisor to get advice on investment and on taxation issues for US Expats. However I am not what I would consider wealthy, just earn a decent salary, and my wife is still a grad student.

Soon I will have meetings with someone from **MWC group** (based in Switzerland), and also a separate meeting with someone from **Thun Financial Advisors** (based in US). MWC contacted me, and I do not know much about them, whereas Thun have posted many articles online and in places like the Wall Street Journal about Expat investments and tax issues. 

My questions are:
1) Does anyone have any experience in dealing with either of these two companies?

2) What are the key questions I should ask as I have never used a financial advisor before?

3) Can anyone recommend other good financial advisors for US Expats living in Switzerland?

I look forward to your responses.

Thanks,

Mark
