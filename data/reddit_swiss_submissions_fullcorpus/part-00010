We're 4 guys sharing an apartment in Winterthur and one of us is leaving, so we're looking for a replacement . Since everyone knows redditors are awesome people I thought I'd also ask here :)

The  apartment has 5.5 rooms (you'll get 1), including kitchen, bathroom, additional toilet, living room and balcony, and is only a 10 minute walk from the center.
The rent is CHF 672.50 per person, plus about on average CHF 25.- per month for electricity/internet/other bills.

The other 3 guys are students at the ZHAW, and I'm a lowly IT serf working mostly from home. We all speak Swiss German, but also understand English (Irish/Scottish/British accents would be very awesome!) and one of us is also fluent in Spanish and learning Italian and other languages.

If you're interested send me a PM, or ask any questions you have in the thread.
