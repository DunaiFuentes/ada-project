A month ago I had a major incident at my house with my soon to be ex-husband. I won't go into details but it got violent and I ended up in a puddle of my own fluids and begged him to help me up. 

He shrugged it off, he was under the influence of alcohol and kept going on mayhem with our furniture. 

I was seriously injured but it wasn't life threatening, I don't really recall every detail of that night.

But I do know that the cops showed up shortly afterwards because the neighbors called them, they broke into the house and arrested him on the spot. An ambulance drove me to the hospital and the entire time this cop sat by my side and kept comforting me, kept talking to me, kept holding my hand when he thought I needed it.
He was there when I had the stitches and a small surgery on my back. He stayed four hours at my side, called a law counselor, convinced the hospital to bring in a shrink and even a reverend I could talk to. He did everything for me!
After a few hours I was released and he took me to a 24/7 bakery where it could eat breakfast and drink some tea. 
He then drove me home and packed a few bags for me while he told me to sit down in the meanwhile.
He drove me to a shelter and talked to the people there. 

He dedicated his night and his shift to me (he had a partner who was there as well mostly, though, but he wasn't really half as nice) and I can say, this was the most amazing thing a stranger has ever done for me.

I'm South African and I don't have anyone here I can turn to. I was always annoyed by the police because they gave me a few speeding tickets and acted rude. But when it comes to some serious situations, they are obviously fully committed and dedicated to help. 

They called me several times after the incident, helped me press charges, kept me updated and I can honestly say that they made me feel so much better, despite the sad personal story that lies within. 
I haven't seen this in South Africa, as we mostly turn around and look away and the police doesn't have the best of reputation. 

I'm so glad this had a positive ending for me, and I'm happy people/neighbors don't look away when they see or hear violence.

In April I get about 4 days in your beautiful country and really want to make the most of it. Because of an old reddit post I really want to visit that bar in Murren with the beautiful view of the mountains. and because of a friend I really want to maybe spend a day in Lucerne.

However that can be completely changed with some recommendations from this sub. So /r/Switzerland , what do I really need to see in your country? Where should I definitely try to go eat? What beer should I definitely try? (Huge lover of beer) Where can I get the most beautiful views? Where are the best driving roads?

What tourist spots should I maybe avoid? What tourist spots should I not miss?

A huge thanks from a fellow Canadian redditor!",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,"Spending ~4 days in Switzerland, where should I visit to make the most of it?",7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1zmzyi/spending_4_days_in_switzerland_where_should_i/
