It is considered to be one of the most prestigious and renowned licences in the world, and I agree with that. But only once you get it. The only driving regulatory body, the [SCAN](http://www.scan-ne.ch/Pages/default.aspx) , holds a complete monopoly on the matter with absolutely no intervention or monitoring on the questions it asks for the theory exam, which is the part that I believe to be a complete scam. I attempted to get my provisional for the first time today by taking the theory exam (taking it late due to personal matters) and failed with 25 error points. It would be very easy to brush this off and say that I hadn't studied hard enough like everyone else seems to say but the truth of the matter is nobody I know even knows anybody that passed it on the first time. Must be a really hard exam right? No. I passed mock exams (they have the same questions and answers as the real deal) every time with little to no error points, the same going for my friends and even family members attempting the same exams. When I was in the exam room taking the test on the provided iPad, I was fairly confident I would pass because you are allowed up to 15 error points. I was even happier to see that the questions that came up were all on my mock exams, same answers too. When I was done, I happily went up to the examiner to find out my score but to my surprise, I had 25 error points. I was slightly taken aback so I asked to see my results and even more surprised to see that some answers I gave correctly on the mock exam were marked wrong, even though I answered them the same way. I would give an example of this but I wouldn't be able to type it out coherently but there were at least 3 questions that did this. At this point, you may be wondering why they would do this and if you are then you probably don't know how much it costs to take this exam. 65.- (62 EUR, 70 USD). I would happily pay this out of my own pocket but this was an obvious act of deception (read:extortion) because they are failing students on purpose to get more money. They do this to almost everyone, however, I don't see why anyone has ever spoken out against it. A lot of my acquaintances know that this is happening but just seem to accept it, so here I am, venting about this crooked agency that purposely fails students with monetary motive. If you can do you licence anywhere else, I advise you to go ahead and do it there because doing it with the SCAN will lead to a lot of frustration and a much lighter wallet.

Edit: getting a few responses saying that they passed first time, glad to hear that! I'm not saying I'm objectively right but I'm just saying it's possible that people are overlooking that the SCAN has the ability to do this to get more money this way with pretty much everyone just accepting it because of the discreet manner in which it is done. I spent almost 15 mins looking through my answers thoroughly and I know as a fact they were correct in the mock exam. 
But at least i'm not doing this in Russia where they are visibly and undoubtedly crooked when it comes to driving schools.

Edit 2: From what i'm hearing in the comments, maybe its a fault in the English version of the test (?) Maybe i'll take it in French and all my suspicions will be put to rest.
