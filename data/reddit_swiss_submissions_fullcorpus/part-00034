First off we're both Swiss citizens on our mom's side, my grandfather came to South Africa when he was young, and our parents and grand parents have kept up on all the army taxes so we have passports and we both got letters when we turned 18 (I'm 23 and my brother is 26) saying we might be called up for military service.

The problem is that when my brother went to the Swiss consulate in Cape Town to ask about doing his service the (nice) staff there told him that they'd never actually gotten a request like this before and weren't actually sure what we should do. The second problem is that we're both English speaking (second language Afrikaans but what use is that) and neither of us have ever been to Switzerland. So questions.

*can an English speaking second generation South African Swiss citizen join the army?
*If we can, how much of a barrier will the English be?
*Where would we even start the process? (we've looked on the internet and the sites that are in English didn't have much about joining)
*Is this even a good idea?
*what is the training etc like - in terms of intensity, experience and skills gained?

Any other advice or guidance here would be much appreciated.

There is a small panel of representative people being interviewed tomorrow and I was suggested for this.

Now, having spent the last few years of my life compulsively browsing the web and reading up on similar legislation like Hadopi in France or SOPA in the US I already have a few things to say about it. However, I am sure some people here might want to add something specific to Switzerland, so I'm leaving this here in case someone has an interesting point to make that I haven't thought about yet.

So this isn't as much an AMA as a ""suggest me anything"" kind of post. I probably can only make a very short point so I can't say that I will relay anything, but I'd rather ask you guys what you think because I know the power of reddit for making me think about stuff from a different angle, or finding new arguments.

So far, I've thought about the obvious privacy issues, problems with requiring ISPs to police their customers and problems with making them and website responsible for what gets through them, issues with the European Human Rights Convention (which Switzerland has to follow in principle....) We are anticipating that there might be questions designed to make us look bad, such as ""but don't you want to protect copyright and enforce IP, for instance for Swiss watch makers against counterfeiters?"" but I think that there is a difference between counterfeit and illegal downloads that is easy to explain. I've also thought a lot about the disproportionate side of the penalties and the criminal offenses, the risk for slippery slope (korben the blogger has a great slippery slope post but I don't really like these arguments, though they make great political ammunition and thought exercises). I think the expression ""using a canon to swat a fly"" is a great way to put it.

But the main thing that I would like to say, though, and I could use help putting it better, is that I think we're having the wrong debate. It's not like people don't agree people who create cultural products shouldn't be able to reap rewards from their sales. But what is totally missing is the debate on how to modernize distribution to get customers what they want, and is it natural that instead of innovation the cultural mega-corporations today are using the full might of the pressure from the US government and the striking power of the FBI to grab after a few more dollars?",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,I was asked to speak about ACTA as a representative of people who resist and oppose it on a TV panel.,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/p3kct/i_was_asked_to_speak_about_acta_as_a/
