This all makes me feel that there are more opportunities for entrepreneurs in Switzerland, because less people are fighting to fill these positions.

I have all of July free in Switzerland and I was thinking of either hiking or cycling or mountain biking across Switzerland at least once or twice. I was looking at the national trails of [schweizmobil](http://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/welcome.cfm) and I was wondering of any of you Swiss/tourists/expats could share any of your experiences or advice on crossing Switzerland via any of the trails.

I also looked at booking tours with [SwissTrails](http://www.swisstrails.ch/) but their services seem a bit pricey.

I was also thinking of camping all the way instead of staying at hostels or hotels on the way. Does anybody have any experience with this?

Edit1: I'm also looking for advice on what I should pack for a multi-day hike or cycling trip. Also, if anybody could share their experiences renting a bike for multiple days.

They have a telephone line, but nothing else I believe. The phone subscription is also something that I've been looking at, because I'm pretty sure it should be possible to get something cheaper than what they have now (my dad only knows what he pays approx, not the actual provider). The phone line would almost never be used for actual calls, since my parents use their cellphones to make calls to the Netherlands or Dutch mobiles. But I guess you need an active phone subscription to be able to get ADSL? That's the case in the Netherlands at least.

So, my fiancee and I are going to Switzerland for our honeymoon! We'll be traveling in early August from JFK Airport to Frankfurt and from there... we're not certain what our plans our. We will be there for two weeks total, although the first and last days are obviously shot due to travel. Here's where we're at so far:

1.) We're arriving in Frankfurt a little before noon, local time. I'm certain it'll take a little bit of time to get off the plane, go through customs, pick up luggage, etc, so we'll be free to do whatever in Europe probably around 13:00 local time.

2.) We've got Eurail tickets. 8 travel days, and we'll be in Europe for 12 days. We DON'T want to be traveling everywhere, everyday. We want to spend time enjoying wherever we land.

3.) However, competing directly with point #2 is the fact that there's tons of places we'd love to visit. Bern, Geneva, Appenzell, Interlaken, Zermatt... I've been to Zermatt before and I'd love to go back but there's only so much time available too.

4.) We're okay with spending two or three days (four even?) in Germany. It'd be way cheaper from a hotel perspective... hotel accommodations in Switzerland are incredibly expensive and will be counting for most of our budget (I've got a soft limit of about $3500 for accommodations and food). On the subject of hotels, we're looking at moderate to moderate-low budget for hotels (not bottom of the barrel and no red-light-district stuff either... this IS our honeymoon so a locking door with our own bathroom would be nice. Wifi would be a big plus).

5.) We're open to experiencing a whole range of things. The more of Switzerland's natural beauty that we can take in the better, keeping in mind that we're stuck to local taxis and the rail system. We'd love to see castles too. We don't want to be completely removed from civilization all the time though, either.

6.) We both know VERY basic German. We can probably get back to the airport in an emergency. She is professionally fluent in Spanish. We (obviously) both know English.

7.) I plan on bringing euros and some Swiss Francs but I want to primarily withdraw from an ATM in Switzerland to get good rates. Is this feasible? I have a magnetic-stripe only ATM card that I'd be withdrawing from.

8.) I plan on booking the first night's hotel somewhere but I want to try to book on the fly for the rest of the trip. I'm bringing a tablet PC in order to make my life easier with this.

So, with all of this being said, I'm looking for some itinerary suggestions and options. Initially we thought about staying in Frankfurt for the first day so that we could not be traveling on the train immediately following landing on the airplane, but the more I read about Frankfurt, the more I'm thinking that's not such a hot idea (hotels near the Hauptbahnhof are near the red light district and that area is seedy anyway).

Anyway, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter. Let me know what I'm doing right, what I'm doing wrong, and your suggestions.
