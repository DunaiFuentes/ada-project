I'm an Indian Software Engineer (yes, it's quite a cliche) and I was working on a short assignment in Switzerland for 3 months (had a short term residence permit too!) and started to like working there.

What can I do to find jobs that really are applicable to me? Are there any job search websites that would help me choose the right job? are there any prerequisites for moving and working in Switzerland? I have started to learn Deutsch so I'm hoping that'll help. I'm looking for any advice that'll help me land a job in Switzerland.
