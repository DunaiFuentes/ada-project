My dad told me that they are working on getting their will in order while they are healthy in order to be organized when the inevitable time does come that their property will need to be left to their children. 

It is my understanding that farmland in Switzerland is treated a little differently when it comes to selling, valuing, or passing down. The canton defines a property value or Ertragswert on the property in which it can be sold for that plus 30%. What I am confused on is how this value is determined? 

Also, is there a resource to look up property values similar to the United States where one can look up in the county property tax database or with an application like Zillow or Trulia?

Edit: First of all Thanks everybody for your responses, second the pediatrist didn't say he's 100% autistic but he has for sure a problem and it's very similar to autism. I think that he doesn't have enough elements but I want to go straight to the problem. My question wasn't clear but if it can help I'd like to know if there's a sort of swiss special center for autism that is reknown in the field.
