Some info about me, if it helps: I have a wife and a 2 year old son, I want to move to fairly large city (Geneva, Zurich, Basel etc.), I work as an I.T. teacher and I have funds of around £50,000. 

One of the major things I need to know about is language - I know German and French, however I only know the basics of Italian and no Rumantsch. Is there a difference between Swiss French and Swiss German to French and German, respectively. If there is, what are the main differences?

My other major query is about tea. And yes, I know this is a very British question, but it's important! Does Switzerland have good tea, and if so which brands are they and where can I find them. 

Any other information will also be taken on board, I can use all the help I get!

Edit: Thanks for the advice, everyone. After talking about this with my wife, we have decided to move to Geneva. We're currently looking at places to rent in the city, and English schools for my son.

Hope everyone is doing well in the New Year.  I'm reaching out again in regards to my trip to Switzerland at the end of May.  I posted here last year: http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/2dbzyb/travelling_from_nyc_to_switzerland_questions/

for suggestions and advice, thanks again!  It appears that planning a trip to Switzerland can be stressful; I finally decided that I will fly into Zurich from NYC and will be visiting for 12 days.  My long list of places to visit has been chopped down to the following (I also used Rick Steves' guide as a reference: https://www.ricksteves.com/europe/switzerland/itinerary)

The list is in no particular order in which I will visit:

* Fly into Zurch
* Lucerne
* Appenzell
* Bern (coworker told me I can skip Bern, is this true?)
* Zermatt
* Interlaken
* Jungfraujoch
* Gruyere
* Berner Oberland
* Gimmelwald
* Lausanne

As you can notice, I will be visiting mostly the German and French part of Switzerland.  My concerns are:

1. Is this list still too much for 12 days in Switzerland?
2. Which Swiss Pass would be best for this journey?
3. Can I stay at Lucerne or at Bern and travel to these places for day trips? (biggest concern)
4. For Americans or any other tourists that travelled through Switzerland, have you used Airbnb or booked hotels for each location?
5. End of May might still warrant unexpected weather in Zermatt, correct?

My first thought was to book two separate Airbnb accommodations; one in Lucerne and another in Bern, so that I can take day trips from one location to the others with ease.  Do you think this is possible for my current itinerary?

Any advice and suggestion is helpful, thank you for the time to read my post!

** EDIT: I think it would be better to fly into Zurich and then fly out back home from Geneva, the ticket prices are similar and I don't have to make my way back to Zurich if I'm trying to visit Lusanne and Montreux. Also, are there any cities that are similar to each other so that I can take them out of my list? **

Just picked up this Swiss 1911 from AIM and have a couple questions I'm having a hard time finding answers for by sleuthing through Google searches. [Here is the specific area I'm looking at](http://i.imgur.com/j4l2aTg.jpg).

- There is a 33 beneath the serial in the same font as the serial, but smaller.  
- There is a C after the serial that looks to be more of a recent addition since the bluing is discolored around the area of the impression.

I will be heading to Baden later this year and was wondering if it would be worth it to bring my hockey gear.

I'm not sure how smart hauling around 10-20lbs of equipment without a car would be.  Here in Canada there a lots of community organized rinks where people just show up with skates+stick and play pick up games.  If there is a local rink (closed-roof) with pick up games I would be down for that as well.

Is there anything in the area that is similar?
