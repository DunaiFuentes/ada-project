If you're ok with a random internet stranger getting your name and email, send me a reddit PM with them. I will add you to my recommendation list. You will recieve an e-mail invitation to do an account.

There are different aspects to consider, but I'm mainly interested in your thoughts on the following points:

- Billag is a private company with access to citizen's records.
- Every household has to pay (""almost fact"") but you can ""choose"" not to pay.
- Some (if not most) money goes into chasing households who exercize their freedom not to pay.
- It is a ""per household"" tax (as opposed to other forms like per person, per usage, per income, etc.)
