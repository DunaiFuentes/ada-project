About 10 years ago I had the privilege of living in this fair country for a period of time, and I fell in love with it. The landscape is gorgeous, the snowboarding is unbelievable, the people are friendly, and the food is incredible - what's not to love?

Earlier this week I was having a conversation with a co-worker and, for some reason or another, le Parfait, that wonderful meat in a tube, came up. Now, I had developed quite the taste for this while living in Switzerland, but I haven't had it since then. Talking about it, however, caused a powerful craving to arise in me, but it's incredibly difficult to locate this product in Canada! So where do I turn? Reddit.

I was hoping that someone on this lovely subreddit would be willing to send me a tube (perhaps two?) of le Parfait, and let me know how much it costs, including shipping. In exchange, I'll provide you with one of three things:

1. Money (via email money transfer, PayPal, cash in a greeting card in an envelope, your choice)
2. Canadian or American products of an approximately equal value that you can't obtain in Switzerland, of your choosing
3. A surprise assortment of Canadian products of an approximately equal value

Thanks for reading, /r/Switzerland, and if one of you should be inclined to help a guy out, send me a PM.



Sincerely,
MrBlockOfCheese
