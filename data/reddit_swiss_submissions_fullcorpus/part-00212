Hello, 

Growing up my grandma made Bräzeli every Christmas. She had a tradition of ""the recipe stays with the iron."" She wouldn't even allow anyone in the room while she made them. Unfortunately she decided to sell her iron at auction during her later years (for about $1,500 USD.. I don't blame her..). 

I have recently acquired a Bräzeli Iron from Switzerland and am in need of a good recipe. 

I'm an still awaiting a power transformer, so I haven't been able to test out recipes I've found online. The issue I'm having is that most recipes I find are meant for pizzelle irons (a trickier Italian cookie). 

This is the most promising recipe I have come across:
http://incorrigiblecook.blogspot.com/2009/12/swiss-brazeli-cookies.html 

The measurements might be off, but how are the ingredients? 
I guess, whats the most tradition recipe?
