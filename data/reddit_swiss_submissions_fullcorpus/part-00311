It's likely I'll have a fair bit of free time too so if you have any ideas regarding what I do with that would also be fantastic.

Anything you can tell me would be much appreciated! Thanks!

I'm not a SVP fan - quite the opposite usually, but in hindsight I think the Minarett-Verbot was a very very good decision.
