The phone is not currently unlocked. Can any of the mobile providers do that for me? 

I've heard that Swisscom is the best, but also the most expensive provider. How much exactly do you have to pay? What payment options do they have (i.e. is it month to month, quarterly, anually, a contract like in America?).

That's for my first phone.

I also brought along a Droid 3 (able to do CDMA or GSM just like my phone, able to swap SIM cards) for my girlfriend.

The case has my identifying info attached to it (although it could be removed without too much effort).  I'm almost certain the perpetrators were sitting across the aisle from me, as that spot had the best visibility of the suitcase, and can provide pretty good descriptions of them.

While frustrating, I luckily didn't keep my valuables in that particular case.  It was mostly dirty laundry, although the shoes I wear 99% of the time were also in there.  It would be nice to find a way to get it back before I fly out of ZRH Monday morning, although I realize the odds are slim.

**EDIT**:  So, I went to the nearby police station this morning, but all they did was give me a claim form that I can complete in the US to seek financial restitution.  Unfortunately, it confirmed for me that the suitcase itself was as good as gone.  I don't even think they're going to contact the Canton of Zug police to alert them, and they informed me that SBB only utilizes their video cameras to help resolve greater crimes (e.g. assault; so putting the ""Video"" stickers near the luggage racks evidently serves only to provide false reassurance).  So the only way I'm going to see it again is if the two young men that stole it saw there wasn't much direct value therein and left it on the street somewhere.
