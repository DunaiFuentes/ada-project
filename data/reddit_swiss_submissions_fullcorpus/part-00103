I recently packed a backpack full of basic gear and set off into the Lauterbrunnen valley. Didn't really know where I was going, but the two days i spent hiking/camping were some of the best of my life. I made sure to wake up super early so that I wouldn't run into too many people on these trails, and I think that's what really made my experience so awesome. I also got to meet a good number of locals with whom I really enjoyed talking to. I really enjoyed talking to locals from the country rather than the cities. People here in Lausanne don't seem as happy as the Swiss-Germans I met in Wengen and Wengernalp :)

I want to do the same exact thing this next weekend (maybe a little different from Lauterbrunnen). I don't want to plan too much. I just need a region to explore. I'm looking for similar things: Locals to chat with, beautiful hikes, places where the police won't fine me for wild camping, lack of too many tourists, etc.

Any suggestions? I'm situated in Lausanne, but I'd be fine to travel across the country to somewhere like... Engadin.  

Thanks for the help

EDIT: Just thought I would share my experience. I'm travelling alone on the weekends

I've noticed this trend when the subject politics is brought up in any conversation, be it in person or over the Internet. I've met countless people that think like this.

Somehow many people in Switzerland think that the country is being exploited by ""everyone"" or that Switzerland has to conform to everything imposed by other countries, in ways that are destroying the national identity or national pride.

I've tried to get a decent explanation why they think like this, but I never get a satisfactory answer.

Is this some sort of defeatism because of the international relations and immigration?

In all seriousness, are we really being taken advantage of or is this just a misconception/fear mongering by the political parties?",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,default,Why is there a widespread opinion in Switzerland about how our country is being exploited by the rest of the world?,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1jo8so/why_is_there_a_widespread_opinion_in_switzerland/
