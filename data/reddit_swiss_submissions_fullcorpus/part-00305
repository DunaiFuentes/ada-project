I just found this website, so forgive me if I did something wrong.

I was out of the country for a couple of months. I changed the mailing address for all my bills to one which I had easy access while abroad, but stupidly forgot one. 

But here's the thing: just a couple of days before I came back, I received a bill from a firm I had never heard of, ""Intrum Justitia"", which wants me to pay them all the unpaid bills, plus an outrageous late payment fee, of which they don't tell me wether it's from them or the original company in question.

So my questions are:

1. What kind of institution is Intrum Justitia to begin with? Are they legit?

2. Can I just contact the company directly to know how much I owe them, pay it, and simply ignore everything that comes from Intrum Justitia?

3. What kind of consequences or repercussions will this bill from I. Justitia have, and can I somehow remove myself from any sort of ties I have with them?

I've become quite familiar with the city and met some nice people. 
However, my post is about finding an apartment. I am supposed to start studying in the university in September as a transfer student, as I already completed some courses in another university; however, I can't quite understand why this university absolutely fails at providing information to students. 
I was apparently supposed to apply for student housing months ago before my application to the university was even due and now there is nothing available and they told me to figure something out myself. I wasn't even given my dossier until a month ago so I dont totally understand what they except. I've met a few students here but they are all swiss and live with their families. I've yet to run into a foreign student. 
I'm basically asking for any tips, information, help. I know of quite a few sites where I can try to search for apartments and rooms but because I am desperate I figured I'd drop a line here. 
If things dont get sorted out soon I am not sure if I'd be able to pursue my studies here and I might have to leave.
