 The way the doctor treated me was horrible, and made me cry. I felt my privacy was violated, and she did not treat me with the compassion and care that a medical professional should have. Since then I have came back SIX TIMES in order to get my bill so I could send it to my insurance company in Canada, and every single time, the staff made a mistake in the bill.  I have never received such horrible medical care or ever seen such unprofessionalism in my entire life. I wrote the owner and director of the office physical letters asking for an apology, and stated that if they do not respond then I will publish what happened to me online so that others do not make the same mistake I did, and avoid going to Permanence Médico-Chirurgicale de Chantepoulet in Geneva. As I expected, they did not respond, and so I am publishing this here. 


**THE DOCTOR:**


I saw the doctor for bumps that I had inside my vagina. I called all the permenances in Geneva and chose Médico-Chirurgicale de Chantepoulet after they told me that the doctor is a woman and speaks English. When I went to reception, I again asked if she speaks English. The receptionist said she speaks English. I can understand only some French, and cannot speak it properly. Having an English-speaking doctor was VERY important for me. 



When I went into the doctor’s office, she did not speak proper English at all. I should have left right then, but I was desperate for medical attention and there was no other female doctor available that evening. So I stayed and tried to explain my problem to her. I told her I had bumps and she said to me “what are bumps?”. I explained it to her and she just told me to take some antibiotics. She did not even want to examine me. I was so shocked that I am telling her about bumps on my genitals, which is very important, and she does not even want to examine them. I told her I am not sure if it is an infection or not, and I want her to look at it and examine me. 



When I took off my clothes and lay down on the examination table, she **made a gross, unhappy face as if she were disgusted by me and did not want to touch me. She did not even try to feel the bumps, and avoided touching me at all.** I had to tell her to feel the bumps, and even still, she would not go inside me to feel them. She just told me I have an infection, without properly examining me. When I asked her the cause, she told me it could be for anything. **She never asked about my sexual history during all of this time.** I was astonished that a patient can come in with bumps on their genitals, and the doctor did not even ask about the possibility that this is a sexually transmitted infection.  This is the most incompetence I have ever seen in a doctor. 



Eventually, she got frustrated that we could not understand each other and asked a male nurse  to come inside. I was so upset about this, because I had specifically wanted to see a female doctor, and did not want to share my problem with a male. **The doctor did not respect my privacy, and made me uncomfortable.** I felt violated.  However, there was no other way to explain to her what I wanted to, so I told him my problem. No one even asked me if I have had sex before. They started putting me down for a huge list of tests – and then I told them that there is no way that I have these diseases, because I have never had sex before. I told them I cannot afford these tests, I am an unpaid student who is visiting the country. So then they told me they would not do all of these tests since it was unnecessary, but would take a bacterial sample.



**When it was time to take the bacterial sample, she did not tell the male nurse that he should not enter the room. She did not even put the curtain up so that I would have any privacy.** I insisted to her that she tell the male nurse not to come in. She was annoyed at this, but finally went to tell him. Just as she went to the door, he was entering. If I had not told her to tell him not to enter, he would have entered and seen me naked, my legs spread open. 



**The doctor took two phone calls while I was talking to her and explaining my medical problem. She took one of these phone calls on her cell phone.** I have no words to explain how disrespectful this is to a patient. I was absolutely furious when I saw this. I have never in my life, seen a doctor take a cell phone call while with a patient. This is the height of unprofessionalism, and I am shocked at everything. I have never seen such an incompetent doctor in my life before. 



I was so upset about everything that happened that day. I felt helpless, and I knew that the doctor did not examine me properly. I was worried that I have a problem, and I cannot afford another visit to the doctor in Switzerland. I came home and cried for more than half an hour because of the way the doctor treated me in her office. She caused me severe emotional distress and a lot of stress. If she did not speak English, your receptionist should not have told me that she does. It is the reception’s fault for misleading me. She does not have the skills required to give patients compassionate care.




**THE BILL:**



**That same day, the receptionist  told me she would email me the bill, the very next day. Since then, I went back to the office SIX times.**



* The first time is when I saw the doctor and they told me I could not get my bill the same day. 
* I waited a few days and when the bill did not come, I called the office. I spent 10 minutes on the phone, and the receptionist could not find my file in the system. She insisted that I come into the office and get the bill in person.  When they could not find my name on the file, I came all the way to Downtown Geneva on a Saturday (my holiday). I got to the office and they told me that **the lab technician accidentally did 5 or 6 EXTRA tests, and for some reason, I was the one who had to pay almost 200CHF for them.** I have never in my life heard of this: this was the doctors office’s fault, and they are asking a patient to pay for their own mistake. Absolutely ridiculous. I was extremely angry and asked to look at the tests they did. They tested for sexually transmitted infections – infections that are IMPOSSIBLE for me to have since I have never had sex.  I was astonished that they wanted me to pay for this and I refused. I waited for 40 minutes at the clinic, and in the end, they told me that I did not have to pay. I asked to get my bill. They told me to come back two days later. The receptionist promised me that ALL of the documents for my bill would be in English, since I have to submit them to a Canadian insurance company.
* I came back two days later, and the documents were NOT in English. A lady told me that she will translate one of the documents to English for me, and to come back. There was also a mistake on one of the reports, my birthday was wrong. I told her these details must be fixed, or else my insurance will not give me my money back. 
* I came back the next day after work and they told me that the facture (billing) office is closed. I asked them why the facture office could not send my facture to reception? They told me that I should call and asked. This is the worst customer service ever. Why would I call? The reception should ask the facture office to give them the bill. This is not my problem, and something that the clinic should be coordinating as a team. I am the customer. 
* After over TWO WEEKS since I originally saw the doctor,  I called the office to ask if they have the bill at reception. I asked politely who I am speaking to, and the receptionist answered me “why do you need to know my name?”. I have never received such a rude answer before. That evening I came back to the office to get my bill. Again, my birthday is wrong on one document. I was extremely upset. I asked for the contact email and phone number of the clinic’s director, and the receptionist told me she cannot give it to me. I am shocked that after so many problems, a customer like me cannot even have the director’s contact information. Again, this is just infuriating and unprofessional. The receptionist told me I can come the next day, in the evening, and the bill would be there (but she would call to confirm).
* The next morning, I get a phone call telling me to come in before noon, even though I had VERY clearly said that I have work and the billing office should give the bill to reception. However, I knew that no one at the office would be able to coordinate this, so I decided to take time off work  to come and finally get my bill. As soon as I stepped in and the receptionist recognized me, she said to her co-worker in French, **“this is the tourist”.** I was right in front of her and knew she was talking about me, but I just ignored it. After waiting 10 minutes, I finally went to the facture office. Over there, I was told that all this time, there was a mathematical error and the office had charged me too much. She gave me money back. I am ABSOLUTELY shocked that after 3 weeks and SIX visits to your office, not a SINGLE person noticed that there is an error in my bill and that I paid too much. 



This  office is the most unorganized, uncoordinated, and unprofessional office I have ever seen in my entire life. I am disgusted by the way the doctor and the staff at the office has treated me. I have not been able to get my money back from insurance because of the team’s incompetency, and you have made my life extremely difficult because in my last few weeks in Geneva. Aside from all of that, the bumps that I saw the doctor for are still there, and I still have not solved my medical problem. This is the worst care I have ever received in my entire life, and I am absolutely furious at how I have been treated. I hope that no one else has to go through what I had to go through. **Not even ONCE has a single person apologized to me for ANY of the above distress.** Every single person would tell me that it is not their fault. This is the biggest problem I have had to deal with in my entire four month stay in Geneva. I simply do not have words any more to explain how frustrated I am with this office and their team. On top of that, their [website](http://www.gmed.ch/en)  has a page called “values” and discusses respect for human rights, humanism, and respecting the patient – yet the clinic has not done ANY of these things. In fact, they have done the opposite.
