UPDATE ON FERGUS - 17 September 2014
I'm afraid I have very little to report on the investigation into Fergus's disappearance last Tuesday, 9 September, but I know that a lot of people are concerned about him and anxious for news.
What I can tell you is that the Scottish Police have confirmed that Fergus was spotted on CCTV footage in Edinburgh Airport boarding an EasyJet flight to Edinburgh. The flight departed Edinburgh at 09:35 on Tuesday and arrived in Geneva at 12:50.
On arrival in Geneva Airport Fergus was due to catch a train that would take him from the airport to Martigny, where the conference he was to attend was being held. The police confirm that he has been identified on Geneva Airport CCTV boarding a train, and that the train was bound for Martigny.
So far, this is all we know. The Scottish Police are working alongside their Swiss counterparts to try and establish if Fergus appears again on any other CCTV footage that might indicate his next movements, but as of yet we have no news on that.
The family would like to thank everyone for their continued support and concern, as well as the Scottish Police and the Swiss authorities for all they're doing to find Fergus.",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,"A friend of mine, Fergus McInnes, is missing.

UPDATE ON FERGUS - 18 September 2014
In my previous update (yesterday) I gave only the facts as known to us at the time. Unfortunately, I have no further facts to pass on, but the police thought it might be helpful if we shared our theories about what Fergus might have done on arrival in Switzerland.
To recap: CCTV footage shows him boarding a train at Geneva Airport bound for Martigny early in the afternoon of Tuesday 9 September. This is the last positive sighting we know about, although we hope that further CCTV footage in Martigny will confirm him getting off the train as planned. We're still waiting for that to be checked by Swiss Police.
The conference Fergus was due to attend was taking place the following day (Wednesday 10 September). The train he boarded at Geneva Airport would arrive in Martigny in the middle of Tuesday afternoon, giving him some free time to do as he wished that afternoon.
Martigny is located in a beautifully scenic area, nestling in a valley surrounded by mountains. There are a number of well marked paths leading up from the town into the countryside, and it is entirely possible that Fergus took a hike up one of these.
As many of you will know, he's a keen hillwalker and it may be that he was wearing his walking boots with the intention of having a hike on Tuesday afternoon. (We don't yet know what he wore on his feet that day but are hoping to establish whether or not it was a pair of walking boots.)
If this is what he did, he would either have had to take his luggage with him (we believe this consisted of a single holdall, which presumably contained a laptop), or store it somewhere until he came back from his walk. There are various places he could have dropped off his luggage, including left luggage lockers at Martigny station. These potential storage areas are, I believe, being checked today.
To us at the moment, this seems a likely enough scenario to warrant further investigation and, to that end, we are receiving invaluable help from Fergus's Swiss colleagues. If he did go into the mountains, he might have got lost, or had an accident of some sort that prevented him from returning to Martigny. There are many possibilities to consider, and any number of things that might have happened.
For the meantime we keep hoping for a positive outcome, and we await further updates from the police. Thanks again to everyone for their concern, support and help in trying to find Fergus.

I'm looking for some advice about the internet speed in Switzerland.

A few years ago I was using cablecom but swtiched over Swisscom because the billing system was fucked up, but I don't really remember it particulary well performing in terms of speed.

I've been with Swisscom (20 Mbit/s) for the last 2 years with no particular problems, but recently I've been offered - as they promise - 125 mbit/s for like half the price.

Is this for real? Is anyone on cablecom and able to confirm this? For me it's hard to believe, expecially for the place where I live.

Thanks for reading!

Myself and a friend are going to be in Switzerland for a flexible 5 days, the first two days in Zurich, next week.

My friend really wants to have some beer among or in the alps, with awesome mountain views. Maybe a bar on the side of the Mountain, or maybe a bar with a good view of mountains, or even bring our own beer to a sweet spot (though he is more of a bar person).

We dont want to spend all our time (and money) driving/riding around Switzerland, and we have to go to Munich when we are done, so somewhere more north/west is preferable.

Any suggestions? I am focusing on Lucerne area right now, but it seems to have few resources except for guided tours in the alps, and the city itself isnt exactly between mountains (i know it is sort of, but we are both from a city next to mountains, so we want super epic mountains not just mountains 10km away in the distance).

Thanks for any suggestions for this last minute request!",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,Best beer and alps places in north/east Switzerland (maybe Lucerne?),6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/2gxx24/best_beer_and_alps_places_in_northeast/
