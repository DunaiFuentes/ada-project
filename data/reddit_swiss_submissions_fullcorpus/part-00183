First of all, a little bit of background concerning my scholarship to put things into perspective:

1. I've been struggling in school a lot from the age of 12 through 16. I had (and still have) a lot of personal issues such as stress and lack of confidence. I still managed to finish school and get my graduation (or whatever it translates to).

1. I consider myself as a ""dumb"" person, because I believe my cultural knowledge is severely lacking (Swiss or international).

1. I am disapointed in a lot of things now that I'm out of school. I regret not having been able to use and focus on all the things we are taught there. I also believe important subjects and topics are lacking or even forgotten to make room for ""more important"" ones.

Alright, so since I've been struggling a lot in school, I may have a biased view of some things. It's also hard to talk about what my feelings were 10 years or so ago but I'll do my best.

One of the thing I regret the most was the total lack of Swiss history. I learned about the stone age, the World Wars and that's about it. I believe Swiss history is more relevant than spending so many years talking about World Wars. It may be important, but skipping our own history is -in my opinion- tragic.

The second thing is language barrier (in Suisse Romande). You get German (Swiss-German?) very early on, but no one gives a damn or even takes it seriously. I feel like this is happening way too early, kids should be given more time before starting to learn a new language, because more often than not they won't take it seriously or care about it (I'm sure the same applies to French or Italian in other regions). Then, there are cantons who are trying to remove German, Italian or French from school and I sincerely think it is a mistake. I'd love to speak German or Italian, but I can't because when I had the chance to, I couldn't seize it because I was one of the kids who thought ""it was dumb and useless"".

The third thing I really regret is all the professional orientation thing. I understand that can vary a lot from person to person and teacher to teacher, but I feel like the ""current"" program is severely outdated.

I realise I may have gone overboard with this as I didn't expect to write this post like that, but heh. I hope I've been clear enough that no one gets offended by this wall of text and that I didn't take it too personally. I also understand that all of what I just said can vary a lot from one place to another, hopefully some of you can relate to this still.",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,Our School System - What do you think of it and what would you like to be adjusted ?,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/2ekifq/our_school_system_what_do_you_think_of_it_and/

this test includes a presentation about a german speaking country,i chose switzerland because i have been there skiing and i the people weren't judging just because we were turists(some of the other countries did not recive us well,ahem danmarkahem, but i realized i dont know anything  else about you guys.
i need to know some of your most used slangs,maybe things that are stereotypical but correct,a joke or 2 that only swiss people know.
maybe you could  explain something that people think of you that isnt true at all,as a swiss of course.
and how to speak like a true swiss,and not just a german who uses swiss slang.
