After spending the night in Paris, my future wife and I will be arriving in Zurich by train and staying in the country for five or six days for the bulk of out honeymoon. We are planning on visiting perhaps three or four different locations and travelling between them on the train. The only place we 100% want to visit is Gruyeres and the Giger museum. Aside from this it is very much a case of being spoilt for choice in that it seems there are so many great places to choose from.

We are both relatively active and 'outdoorsy' people so quite like the idea of exploring some of the amazing scenery on foot or climbing a mountain, though as we will be unable to bring too much equipment with us, anything too extreme probably wouldn't work. Any suggestions on this would be greatly appreciated.

Luxury accommodation and food is not really a priority for us, as we have this type of experience planned for the first and last nights of the trip respectively. 

The biggest issue we are having is striking a balance between travelling, and exploring the places we travel too. The amazing railway network and scenery makes the train journeys an enjoyable experience in themselves and something we can't wait to experience, but I guess there is always a limit to how much time anyone is going to want to spend on a train.

Anyway, this post is just a shout out to see if anyone has any help or advice to offer.

Thanks in advance.

I find the idea great as I have never left my island (Hawaii) I am interested in Science and math and would love to attend college in another country. I am really scared because I have never left my Island as I've explained. I come from a big family and have always had people around me that I am familiar with. I really want to move away with him and start a new life. We will have about 10,000 USD to start with. He wants to join the swiss military and I would love to Volunteer in the military. My background is in mechanics and Engineering. I can take virtually anything I see and break it apart and piece it back together. I grew up as a poor child. My father would build/renovate houses for our rent so I have extensive carpentry/woodworking/painting/masonry/tile setter/plumbing skills and I can also sew. Being from Hawaii I can grow food and hunt as well although I know our game is different. 



I am writing this in hopes that some of my questions can be answered. 

How are schools out there for children?
For adults?
School hours for kids?
Is there after school curriculum?
Can women who are not native join military?
What are the phone carriers out there?
If we find work out there and lose our jobs are there shelters or transition homes to help out the family if we become homeless?
How much is medical insurance?
What is the basic Ettiquette? (Not sure if that's written right)
What is the price of internet?
Would it be okay to bring solar panels in?
Do people live off catchment there?
Rent? 
Rent to own homes?
Children as latch key kids if both parents are working?
I'm not religious will that cause problems?
I do not speak german but I am trying to learn. Will that be a huge problem?
Food prices and selection? Rice? Pasta? Veggies? FISH?? 
Oh please tell me theres fish!!
There's fish right?
Did I mention fish?
How about monthly bus/train passes?
Do schools offer bus routes for children?
Would it be ok if my main transportation was skateboard or a bicycle?
Can I bring my Gun with me?
How hard will it be for me to go to school?
Do people have babysitters or is it only day centers?
If so how much?


I'm sure I'll have a lot more questions but that's it for now. Thank you to anyone who can offer any knowledge to me. 

Also my children are not my spouses how will that affect everything?
Also he works for Subaru telescopes on Mauna kea will that heighten his chances also?
