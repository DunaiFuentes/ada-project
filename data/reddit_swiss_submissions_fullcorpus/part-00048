Is this a good or bad idea? Any red flags I should know about? Like is it very hard to get parking at day hike places or something?

- /r/lausanne (10 readers)
- /r/basel (2 readers)
- and the recently started /r/askswitzerland (59 readers)

(if you know of more I'll add them to the list)

I'm ignoring specialized reddits like /r/ethz and /r/cern, since these have a legitimate purpose in my opinion (even though they're very low-traffic too).

I propose this plan:

- Message all the moderators and/or cross-post this post in these subreddits (I'll do that if there's a positive response in /r/switzerland so far)
- Discuss, and have some kind of vote or whatever
- If we decide to follow through with it we could just post a note with a link to /r/switzerland in each subreddit, and/or do something like /r/fringeTV has done (though this will hide the old posts, and will not be visible to users who disable subreddit styles)
