I wanted to see some more nice places before I go home again, and I was browsing the internet for ideas. Then I stumbled upon the [butterfly path](http://www.schmetterlingspfad.ch/wanderungen/) in Lungern. Since I study butterflies (in the lab) for my internship I thought it would be a great idea to go there. However, I saw that it is a very long route, 15 km with a height difference of 1500 meter. On the map it says that there is a cable train going to Schönbüel and you could walk downwards. My idea was to take the cable train, only walk the top part (as I expect most butterflies to be in the alpine grasslands) and then go back with the cable train. 

However, it seems that the cable train [has closed down](http://www.panoramawelt.ch/de/sport-unterhaltung/bergbahnen) from May on this year. Can anybody confirm whether this is true? (I can read quite some German but searching for stuff in google is more complicated for me) And if so, is there no way to get up there other than walking/car? I think I will be very dissappointed if I start from below and have to go back after a few hours, not having seen many butterflies because they are all higher up in the mountains.
