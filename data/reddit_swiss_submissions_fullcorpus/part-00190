Obligatory: Long time lurker, first time poster

I would like to live in Switzerland one day (it seems the easiest way to get citizenship is through marriage).

Right now, I'm deciding on a language to learn and, in prepping to be in Switzerland, my decision is going to based largely upon which regions seems like the best to live within.

What would you say differentiates the Swiss-German, French and Italian areas of Switzerland?

My dream would be to live in a small town/village that is 10-15 minutes away from a major city via public transport

Edit 1: My tentative thoughts as of right now is Swiss-German seems like the way to go because its the most used language in the country. My current impression is that the only key difference between the regions is language, but the culture remains the same -- But, it is still early. 

Edit 2: Thanks again everyone for the advice. This is really great. 

I thought it valuable to clarify: I'm from the US and have citizenship only here. 

Edit 3: This is not related to the primary question of this post, but is instead related to my ability to live in Switzerland: **What if I just got citizenship in an EU country with comparatively lax citizenship laws and then lived in Switzerland?

The update written by his sister who is also commenting and posting on this subreddit.

UPDATE ON FERGUS - 20 September 2014

We've learned a few things today.

We now know that Fergus did not leave his bag in a left luggage locker in Martigny station. This suggests that he took it with him wherever it was he was going. The Swiss police are following up the idea that he may have gone to Salvan, 8km away from Martigny. He may have walked there or, perhaps more likely given his luggage and the limited time he had before meeting colleagues in the evening, taken a small train. The train ride between Martigny and Salvan takes 15 minutes, whereas walking would take well over an hour, even at a fast pace. 

Fergus's mobile phone, which we believe he had with him, has not been used since he left the UK. However, the Scottish Police have passed the phone's IMEI number (a serial number unique to the phone) to the Swiss Police, in case the SIM card has been changed. If a Swiss SIM has been put into the phone in place of the UK one, the Swiss police should now be able to tell if the phone has been used in Switzerland.

The Swiss police have been actively searching the area around Salvan for any sign of Fergus, and his Swiss colleagues have been working hard to establish what they can. It's thanks to them that we know about the left luggage lockers and the train to Salvan. They believe it's quite likely that Fergus could have gone to Salvan in the time he had. They have also informed us that the police are working alongside mountain guides in the Salvan area.

Thanks to everyone for sharing news articles, posting and commenting on Facebook and elsewhere, getting in touch with ideas and offers of help, and generally being very kind and supportive. We wouldn't have learned nearly as much as we have without the assistance of Fergus's many friends and colleagues.

Hello, I recently finished my studies in sports (Fitness Training Instructor and Personal Trainer) at FITSPRO, a school afiliated to FISAF which is recognized in over 50 countries.

I am currently looking for a job, but will soon have to get a knee surgery that will render me invalid/unable to do that kind of job for around 4-5 months.

My financial situation is the following: 0 income, depending on my mother which works for an income of less than 4000CHF per month.
Do I have any right to some insurance/invalidity income?
I am from the region of Geneva. Thanks a lot for your informations and advice!",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,"My Swiss friend will be disabled for 5 months, can he get a payroll for disability in Swiss?",5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/2h8z6r/my_swiss_friend_will_be_disabled_for_5_months_can/
