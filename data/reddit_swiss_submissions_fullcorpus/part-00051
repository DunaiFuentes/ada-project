[Politnetz.ch](http://www.politnetz.ch/) is a social network and blog platform for politicians and citizens, and we're also trying to do interesting things with open government data such as [visualisations of parliament votes](http://www.politnetz.ch/parlament/session). The aim of the project is to allow a direct public discourse between politicians and citizens, and make politics more accessible in order to combat voter fatigue among disinterested citizens.

The website has been online for 3 years now and has grown to &gt;15'000 users with a small but loyal core of a few hundred regular contributors. I've started working there last autumn and added some things like threaded comments (with a lot of inspiration from Reddit, of course). Right now we're focussing on growing our community and making our whole platform more interesting to the average citizen, so if you have any ideas, suggestions or criticism I would love to hear it!

For reference, some areas we'll be concentrating on are:

- Rethinking the main navigation of the site
- Redesigning the frontpage
- Redesigning the profile pages
- Add obligatory social networking features like following/friending, notifications, private messages

I also have two general questions for you:

- What are the things about politics in Switzerland that interest / bore the hell out of you?
- Where do you usually discuss news/politics online? I'm asking because there don't seem to be any ""big"" forum websites in Switzerland, so all the discussion usually ends up on news websites in their (mostly) crappy commenting systems.

Of course if you have a question about Politnetz you can AMA!",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,IAmA developer at politnetz.ch and would love to hear some feedback from Redditors on our platform,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/wikq5/iama_developer_at_politnetzch_and_would_love_to/

Before you ask, yes I know that Switzerland and Germany are different countries, but I've also known people who have lived in one country and worked in another within the EU.
