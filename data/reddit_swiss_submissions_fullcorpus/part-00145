I've been living in a business apartment for the past 8 months but I am now looking for flats (preferably houses) in or around Zurich that allow pets. Is this something common in Switzerland? I've seen a couple of people with dogs but comparing it to Czech Republic I feel that animal companionship is not that popular here. 

Would it be hard for me to find a landlord that would allow me to also have a dog? Can you direct me to any webpages/agencies that might specialize in something like this or that have filters for ""Pets"" on their webpages?

My budget is up to 2500 CHF/month.

Thanks a lot.

I can do any kind of office job, secretary job, stuff like that. My last job in America was as an administrative assistant, I was responsible for things like writing newsletters, buying/selling horses (worth ranges from a couple of hundred bucks to $XX,XXX.. I have experience with all levels/kinds of horses from a cheap pony to a promising professional dressage horse), inputting profits into Quickbooks, managing social media, making business calls/sending business emails, I also organized a rather large construction project (~$20,000 driveway repaving). 

My other job was working as an assistant to a medical recruiter. That job consisted of looking through resumes (I sorted out the completely inappropriate/bad ones for her), going on LinkedIn to find new candidates (with premium search filters), cold calling/emailing prospective new placements (I got a finders fee for anyone who I found that got placed), managing her CRM database (Sage ACT), taking notes while she interviewed candidates on the phone, along with other general and basic office skills. I've also done some basic IT/troubleshooting for this woman that consisted of ""I have this problem"" ""Okay, I'll Google it and fix it for you with-in an hour"".

I also have some programming experience with HTML, CSS, Java, and Python (also VisualBasic, but that's not relevant anymore).

Re: my German, it's okay. I can ask what I need to ask, I can understand most directions that are given to me, but I don't feel comfortable applying for jobs because my German is B1-B2.

So that's a little bit about my work experience and my German, so now for my questions: Do you know of staffing or temp agencies that would be able to place me? What kinds of jobs/job titles should I be Googling for? Where do I look for jobs in Switzerland? Should I be able to find a job like this in stadt Bern (I would imagine so since it's a bigger city)?
