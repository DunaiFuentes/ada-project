I am an avid long distance wilderness backpacker with a fair amount of experience that lives in Sweden.

So has anyone done both trails (either the entire trail or sections)?  If so, which one did you like more and why?

In general do these trails have more ""raw"" or ""wild"" nature, or is there a lot of road/street hiking from one village to another?

Or any other general impressions and/or tips would be greatly appreciated!

EDIT: It appears that these trails and the overall Via Alpina trail systems are somewhat new (created in 2000 and receiving EU funding until 2008), so for those unfamiliar and for the record, you can read more about Via Alpina here:

My wife has Swedish and US citizenship.  She has recently been offered a good job opportunity in Zurich, Switzerland that would last at least two years.

As an EU citizen it is relatively easy for her to get a visa, and as a spouse I should be okay as well.

Now for the complicated part.  I work full-time for a US company, but I do so remotely.  I've discussed it with my employer, and as long as the work gets done, they are okay if I do it from Switzerland instead of the US.  So, in practice, I should be able to continue my current employment from Zurich.

If I am US citizen working for a US employer, but living full-time in Zurich, then how do I go about managing the Switzerland visa and tax issues?  My admittedly murky understanding of the Swiss tax code seems to indicate that they won't let me register as ""self-employed"" if all my income comes from a single source (prohibition on ""Scheinselbständigkeit""). If I'm not ""self-employed"" then it seems like I would need to convince my US employer to register in Switzerland and pay the employer share of taxes and related fees directly, which seems complicated.

Is my understanding accurate?  I would be fine being a ""self-employed contractor"" and paying the extra taxes and such directly, but is that really not allowed?  Is there another option?  If I do need to convince my US employer to pay Swiss employment taxes and such directly, then what would be involved in setting that up?

Is there a government office, or inexpensive professional that might be able to give a definitive answer to these questions?

For the record, I think I understand the US half of the employment and tax equation, but it is the rules on the Switzerland side that have me confused and worried.

I am a currently a sophomore in high school (en seconde^^? ) in the United States and I have been researching EPFL to apply for admission in two years.

I am 15 years old and I am an American citizen. My school teaches Parisian French and I am enrolled in the final year of French (AP level) for next year.

I will, in all likelihood, qualify for admission through the Reduced Entrance Exam, because I will fulfill the AP requirement next year (scoring 3s or above hopefully 😛) and will need only to take AP Biology and an economics course in my final year of high school to fit the subject requirements.

Because of this, I have been searching for information on the Reduced Exam. None was immediately visible on the various EPF Lausanne webpages I visited (though information on the Full Exam was prominent). Are there study materials available for the test?

Additionally, I would like to know more about student housing in Lausanne. I imagine I'll be living in a small apartment near the university. What can my family expect to pay for rent? Will I be sharing space with other students? How can I estimate the cost of living?
