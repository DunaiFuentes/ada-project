While it is very early in the planning stages and we don't even know what we can take with us yet, I thought I'd throw this question out there.

My husband and I are going to be moving to Basel (from the US) sometime early next year. In trying to figure out what to bring with us, I'm really tempted to bring my '71 beetle. I love this car. It is a hoot to drive and is in good shape. But the paint job is... different. 

So baring moving costs (it'll come only if the company pays) and Swiss inspection/emissions requirements, would I run into any problems (social or otherwise) if I brought it with me?


**Edited:** It sounds like I should bring my car if possible! And according a link I found:

&gt;The test needs to be carried out every two years for diesel cars and cars equipped with catalytic converters. All other cars should be tested annually.

It looks like this will be my next worry. I wonder if there's a way to learn what the Swiss tolerances are and compare them to what the bugs tests at here...
