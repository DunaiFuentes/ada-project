________________________________________________________  

My wife and I are Americans, living in Zurich. A big reason for moving to CH was to have the opportunity to travel on a regular basis through Europe, which has gone great for the 4+ months we've been living here.  
     
     
While visiting other countries is great, we realized we should focus a bit more on all of the amazing things Switzerland has to offer and begin exploring the country we're living in a bit more.  
     
     
I am writing in hopes that people can share recommendations for weekend trips based on events/celebrations happening in specific cities/cantons.  
     
     
Where we've been so far:

* Basel
* Luzern
* Interlaken
* Rapperswil
* Geneva  

     
Example: I'd love to experience Schwingen. Can anyone recommend:

* Time of year to go to a match
* Best city/arena
* How long should I spend in the city
* Other things to do while we're there
* Any customs or serious differences I should be aware of traveling from Zurich
     
     
Schwingen is only one example, but we're very open minded and excited to experience what fellow ""Redduitors"" think are the best events and cities CH has to offer.  
     
     
**tl/dr**: What are the best weekend trips in CH and some unique events to plan the trips around?  
     
     
     
Thanks in advance for the ideas and feedback!

But first they sold me a computer which after sending it back twice still didn't work 100% correctly. 

Now I sent them my new ultrabook. I had spilled a drink over the keyboard and the space and c key were sticky but overall it was still working perfectly. Since those ultrabooks are really slim I did not want to take it apart and clean it myself so I brought it to the nearest digitec shop. Vendor seemed to be a nice and competent guy and the two of us agreed that it will probably only be necessary to take the ultrabook apart, clean the keyboard with destilled water and I would probably get it back by the next week, perhaps the week after. I've been waiting for 4 weeks until I got a 300 Fr. offer for the repair (which included replacing the entire case), 100 for the option to just sending it back to me and 75 to throw it away. This was not what I had signed up for but after some back and forth we agreed on replacing only the keyboard for 200 Fr.. The repairs would take, again, one to two weeks and everything was confirmed via email. When I two weeks later asked about my dearest ultrabook I got the response that they had not startet the repairs since I did not have paid for them yet. They sendt me the bill the day later without a single sorry or whatsoever.

Long story short: I sendt my Ultrabook 8 weeks ago because of sticky keys to digitec and still have nothing gotten back except a 200 Fr. bill which I had to request myself.

I got a laptop last year and start having problems with it. I contacted technical support twice already. Second time I asked about the refund policy and they told me that to get a refund I have to have a problem after two repairs. Today I contacted them again with yet another problem and asked for a refund, but the guy told me that for Switzerland it is normally impossible (something about not being in the EU, he said he couldn't explain it in English), yet they will try to organise it.

I've heard from another person that by Swiss law I am allowed to return the product after the third defect. Does anyone know Swill laws on this thing? I want to be prepared for the case of them refusing me the refund.

**Update**: thank you for replying. I've made some search and apparently Dell is right, Swiss law on this thing can be amended by the contract. And for the Dell general conditions say that they will repair and replace the product if necessary and ""claim nothing more"".
