For example, say someone in a building had their key stolen by someone who knew their address. I expect that they would need to get the lock changed on the door to their flat, but what about the door to their building?

It would seem like a lot of hassle to change all the keys of all the people in a building just because of one theft, so I guess there is some nice system such that each key can be isolated. Is this the case, or would all the locks in all the flats in the building need to be changed?

The fancy one I have for work has some electronic magic in that's used for external doors. So I guess the use of those can be prevented by reprogramming the lock. But what about the old-fashioned non-electric ones. Is their some way that the cylinder can be tinkered with such that the stolen key can no longer be used.

I guess that this is not really a Swiss topic, since such issues will arise anywhere that there are buildings containing many flats.

So I am American, but I am lucky in that my grandma was Swiss and I have claimed a passport a couple years back. I'm currently studying chemical engineering and I have a couple questions.

1) how difficult would obtaining a job in chemical engineering be? Also, where in Switzerland would those jobs be located? I've heard Lausanne and Zurich. My family, which admittedly I've only seen once lives near st gallen in watville. What kind of salary do engineers make over there and would lifestyle be similar to being Ann engineer in the states? 

2) how would you rate quality of life in Switzerland besides a few differences like lack of 24 hour culture etc and convenience that embodies America. 

3) I haven't had to serve in the military even though I have citizenship. If I did move there, would I have to join and do my time? I assume I will. 

4) anything else I should know before making this decision.

I'm new in Switzerland, and I just moved to Zug, where I work too. 
I'm in a temporary apartment and I'll have to look for some long term accommodation soon. 
Would you suggest to look for something in Zug or in Zurich? 
I've been reading housing is a bit of a nightmare in this area.

Also, are there some redditors around? it'd be nice to grab a beer sometimes ;)

cheers!
