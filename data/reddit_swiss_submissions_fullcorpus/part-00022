I am a young kiwi who is half swiss and grown up in New Zealand hearing all about Switzerland!

After my last visit 10 years ago (when I was only 11!) I have decided that I want/NEED to return! I work full time and can only get 3 and a bit weeks in CH! I will be travelling alone and plan to live with family and friends around Appenzell. It will be in winter and, at this stage, around January.

I was hoping to hear some tips and ""must see"" locations around Switzerland in winter. I love being half Swiss and am very proud of it but I know nothing of my own country! So please! I need some suggestions of what I need to see and what I need to do as someone who is swiss!

I like the idea of an alpine train trip... any ""must do's"" or recommendations for the best train trip during winter? I love the idea of seeing beautiful landscapes and being with nature. (Mountains, lakes, walks etc) so if you have any tips where I can do that, I would love to hear it!  I love the outdoors!

I love the idea of cafe's at the top of mountains and in obscure places that are only accessible by walking or gondola/lift etc. Can anyone recommend me some nice places like that? Somewhere with an awesome view or location and a killer hot chocolate! :D haha. I dont mind having to walk there if I have to!

Being around Appenzell, I am already planning on visting Säntis. Will that be ok to visit around winter? or will it be a bit inaccessible? I am used to horrible winds and hard rain in NZ winter! haha. But I know nothing of what its like over there!

Also what foods and meals do you recommend that I try while I am there? I am keen to try all the famous and tradional food that I cant get here in little old NZ! :D

Thanks heaps!! Sorry for all the questions haha
