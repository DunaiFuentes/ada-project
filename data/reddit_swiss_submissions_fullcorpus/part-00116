* No, Switzerland is not the libertarian paradise you've been dreaming of since you read ""Atlas Shrugged"" as an impressionable teenager. it's actually quite heavily regulated in many ways.
* You are required by law to buy health insurance. OMG OBAMACARE. Most people think this is a good thing.
* You are required to register your place of residence with the local authorities. OMG BIG GOVERNMENT.
* No, you can't (unless you hold an EU/EFTA passport) just like move here, say ""o hai guyz livin here now kthx"" and not expect to be deported. You need a work permit and you need a visa, even if you consider yourself self-supporting. Unless you have a *lot* of money to invest locally, you'll also need to get a job.
* Anyone wanting to give you a job has to prove they can't find someone from Switzerland or within the EU-15.
* Don't think you can just hack your way around this - you will get found out.
* If you're moving here in pursuit of a Swiss passport, be aware that in most cases you won't even be able to start the application process until you've been here for 12 years. This may drop to 8 in the future, but for the time being if it's a European passport you're after there are EU member states that it's far easier to get citizenship in (after five years of legal residency in some cases).
* Yes, many people have guns at home, but they sure as hell don't keep them loaded, most people actually find the requirement to keep them kind of annoying, and if you own more than one gun people will consider you a bit odd. Guns are actually strictly regulated, as Switzerland's army is effectively a.. *cough* well-ordered militia.
* Just to make it really clear, Swiss people will look very funnily at you and step back carefully if you start talking about OMG GUN RIGHTS HOME PROTECTION SECOND AMENDMENT FREEEEEDUHM. As far as they're concerned, guns are things you shoot either at the range or in the army. Or at Knabenschiessen.
* If you shoot someone breaking into your house you will go to prison. On the other hand, the likelihood of your house being broken into is relatively low, and if you call the police they will arrive quickly.
* That's probably enough about guns. But gosh, some people sure have some funny ideas about the Swiss and guns.
* Don't worry about buying a car. If you're moving to a reasonably-sized town or a city it's fairly unlikely you'll need one unless you're a special case. The public transport really is that good.
* The public transport does occasionally break down, even here. Just not nearly as often as in many other places.
* Don't eat fondue in summer.
* Yes, income tax is low. However, the cost of living is high, and many things (i.e. healthcare, garbage collection) which are largely publicly funded in other countries are paid for separately.
* Minimum-wage ""wage slave"" jobs effectively don't exist here, which is part of the reason the cost of living is high - you can be reasonably sure that anyone performing a service is being paid fairly for doing it.
* Switzerland is (nearly) a direct democracy. That means peopel regularly are called on to vote on a variety of things, such as basic income and CEO wage limits. It doesn't mean these things are likely to happen. Except for that minaret ban, which was kinda embarrassing (and will probably get overturned in Strasbourg anyway when someone bothers to challenge it.)
* Learning French will not help you in Zürich. Learning German will not help you in Geneva.
* On the other hand, Swiss people greatly appreciate foreigners attempting to speak the local language.
* Do not expect people in restaurants to fawn over you constantly like they do in America. Plus, try not to complain at anyone within earshot that OMG THE SERVICE HERE IS TERRIBLE just because they don't do the aforementioned fawning. The waiter isn't impressed by your platinum Amex, probably because he has one himself.
* Be sure it's actually Switzerland you're thinking of moving to. If you want to move here for the fjords and the midnight sun, you should probably pop over to r/Sweden instead.

Unfortunately, the canton has asked me to get a document signed by 'A British authority' which states there is no reason i cannot buy a firearm (not a danger to others, not a danger to myself, no criminal record etc). The problem is nobody seems to know who i should get to sign this thing - i tried talking to the British embassy, but apparently they cannot request criminal record checks, and had no idea who i should talk to. I chatted with some other airsofters from Germany who had a similar problem, but apparently their embassy was able to resolve it for them. If there are any redditors here who have any idea who i could talk to, your advice would be much appreciated

Thanks!
