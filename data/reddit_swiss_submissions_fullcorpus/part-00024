Like the title says, my girlfriend and I (both around 24yo) are going to be in Europe from Sept 5th-Oct 5th. Halfway through there is Switzerland. We're staying in Montreux for a couple nights, and Interlaken for a few nights. I'm sure there are plenty of tourist attractions we can go and do, but it's more fun for us to meet locals and see what you guys go out and do for fun!

We have money for hostels, if necessary, but any night staying on someone's couch/floor saves us a lot of money and is greatly appreciated!

So, if anyone here is in either of those towns, or even nearby, we'd love to meet up and grab a beer or three at your favorite pub/bar, and if you have a place to stay for even a night, we'd greatly appreciate it! We could take you out for food or buy you a few drinks in thanks.

So you've got the date and the place. The easiest way to meet in Bern in the station is the Meeting point in the main hall. You can just have a look at the spot in the following pictures - http://imgur.com/EQFzk - http://imgur.com/Rub4Q - so nobody wait at the wrong place ;-) 

There is a train from St-Gallen via Zürich which arrives at 13:58
(12:53 St Gallen - 13:02 Zurich HB)
And the train from Geneva via Lausanne and Fribourg which arrives at 13:56 
(12:10 Geneva - 12:45 Lausanne - 13:34 Fribourg)

Then we can also organize some car sharing, if anybody could take a car he/she can add his itinerary and where it's possible to pick-up other redditors. 
http://doodle.com/vf2kziqzfsfqr95i
Then if anybody want to get in this car just send PM via reddit, I think you could share the price of the petrol, which will be way less than a train fare. There is a big parking directly in the station of Bern, but I don't really know if it's expensive or not. I think it is, so if you're early try to find another spot to park the car...

I was planning on applying to ETH Zurich's Master's degree programme in Computer Science. However, upon reading the requirements profile, I am left unsure as to how they would value my current diploma.

The document says that the substance of certain courses from ETH Bachelor's degree programme is required. Then they list the courses with associated ECTS credit values and state that your application won't be considered if you lack more than 15 credits.

Now, some of the courses are valued at more ECTS credits than what I've already completed at my university, but with the same topics covered (which is what I take ""substance"" to mean). I am not sure whether I'd fulfill the requirement on the basis of having studied the topics or whether I'd fail them because of the credit discrepancy.

Of course, I already wrote an email to the Admissions Department, but I was actually unpleasantly surprised that the answer turned out completely unhelpful - simply sending me a link to the document I was enquiring about.

So, I came here hoping that there would be some current ETH student or someone else who's maybe had experience with this or who could point me in the right direction.
