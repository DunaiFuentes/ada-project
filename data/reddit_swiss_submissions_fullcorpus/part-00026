I will debate that with anyone who is willing, but I came to your little subrebbit to see the Swiss people's reaction to the few week old news that the Swiss government had pegged the Franc to the Euro and found no links or r/personals about the subject. I study economics and global economics for that matter, along with current events and world history as a hobby. Almost everybody who was criticial of the global financial and the mess that is ongoing agreed; the Swiss Franc is one of the few ""safehavens"" in the world when it comes to currencies and investments. I'm an anti-fiat, gold and silver bug myself, but base on the history of the Swiss Franc, it's always been the clean your dirty fiat currency; currency. I know Swiss banking is only part of the Swiss economy, not sure the %, but when I heard the news that the Franc was going to be pegged to the Euro, I was shocked. I know the argument ""why"" it will be ""helpful"". I know that it will, in theory, help Swiss exporters, like Nestle, by pegging the currency because of it's strong base. What I know that the Swiss people know, is that the Swiss government or Swiss Finance Ministers are batshit insane. Why on Earth would this seem like a good idea to peg your Franc to the Euro, that will probably not even make it pass 2013? To help exporters solely? By doing this, you have destroyed the Swiss banking sector almost overnight. I been hearing numerous stories of foreigners who have investments in Swiss banks withdrawling their investment out of the country as quick as they can. Other stories are the utter outrage of these people that have investments in Switzerland, that the government would even pull a stunt like these. Americans have the luxury to be the World's Reserve currency and yet the policy makers in the country are a big factor in the global meltdown, but it seems to me that the Swiss jumped off the bridge following the globe's footsteps. I even recall hearing a Swiss official saying that the Swiss government would print to infinity to keep the Swiss Franc cheap. Even in the U.S. policy makers can't say things like that in public, even though that's exactly what they're doing behind closed doors.
