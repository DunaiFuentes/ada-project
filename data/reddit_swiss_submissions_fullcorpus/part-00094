As the title states we are planning on renting a vehicle and just driving as much of Europe as possible.
 A little background on us, we got married last December had no money or desire for an elaborate wedding so we sold everything we had quit our jobs in America and bought 2 tickets to Spain and have been living in a villa for the last 3 months. My wife blogs about it every week here if you enjoy reading blogs from people you haven't meet yet.
http://encourged2change.blogspot.com.es/

We are reaching out to the Reddit community:
We would love to see every square kilometer of Europe but we will be out of money in 9 months if we can stick to a budget.

We are looking to Explore the country you live in! 

We would like to know where would you go if you had the chance to see any part of Europe?

It can be your own country or one you would visit if you had some vacation time.

Just post the name of the country, area, attraction, town, city name  

If you would like to elaborate on your choice feel free to do so, we have many touristy places picked out but we both feel like reading about and viewing the places online kinda takes away from the experience once we get there, so taking a crowd sourcing approach to planning our rout seems like a better idea.

td/lr : me/wife low funds travel Europe living in vehicle looking for lesser known places to see visit.

Update: We have left Spain driven through France hopped onto our first Ferry to cross the English Channel and are now driving through England! Stay tuned as we drive through your neighborhood. You can follow us through my wife's blog @ http://encourged2change.blogspot.com.es/

Update Lands End: We have driven through most of Southeast and now Southwest England we have been parking at the beach and finding farms to park at after asking the farm owners for permission, many of the people we meet are kind and helpful much more often than in the U.S. We took a week to see London now heading North.

Physicists hope that many unsolved mysteries –– such as the existence of dark matter or the matter-antimatter asymmetry –– will be explained by the direct observation of new particles produced in the LHC. However, new particles may also be observed indirectly through extremely rare decay processes. Today, in around 2.5 hours, experts from the [LHCb Experiment at the LHC](http://cern.ch/lhcb-public/) will discuss their latest results in these searches for new physics, and answer any questions you may have on these topics, in our weekly outreach series, **Hangout with CERN**!

The aim of **Hangout with CERN** is to answer questions from the public about CERN and its research. So, send in your penguin-related questions in comments below and we will pose them to our experts!

More details on the [Google+ event invite](https://plus.google.com/events/cbmo1g2sot8q1s9hvduqf084jak).

The webcast is at 17:00 CEST (see [current local time](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=87) in Geneva), and you can tune in on CERN's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/CERNTV) or [Google+ page](https://plus.google.com/+CERN).

I am a Swiss computer science student and I have been contacted by a company to develop a software for them in the next future. 
I am thinking about register myself as an independent (also for possible future works with other companies), but I didn't manage to find enough information about the procedure to get the freelance status. 
For example, I have been told by a friend that you need to somehow prove to have multiple customers, which I don't have at the moment.

Did anybody have a similar situation? Or any useful legal or practical information?

Thank you a lot in advance!",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,Working as a freelancer in Switzerland,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1fsnd1/working_as_a_freelancer_in_switzerland/

I got a job offer and I'm considering moving to Basel.
Everywhere I go I hear how expensive Switzerland is.
The pay is 85 000 gross / year.
I'm young, single, no kinds, no mortgage. Would I have a decent life there? Enough to rent a decent 1 bedroom apartment in the city, have some social life, do a bit of traveling and save up a little?

What are your thoughts?

I'd appreciate any feedback.
