**This is what I want to achieve:**
Drive on beautiful roads in Switzerland, see stunning scenery (hike, paraglide), stop/stay in small towns where there are few tourists.
Lastly, and most importantly, I want to propose to my girlfriend on this trip.

**Proposal:**
My idea was to do it at a secluded place, watching the sunrise/sunset.  Could anyone recommend a place they know or been to that is not frequented by tourists?

I was considering Mt. Rigi.  I know it's a huge tourist attraction.  However, my idea was to hike up the mountain in the morning before anyone was there.  Is that realistic?  Plus, I saw this on their website.  They don't provide much detail though: http://www.rigi.ch/Adventures/Rest-relaxation/Places-for-rest-and-rejuvenation.  There has to be other places in the country which are gorgeous and there won't be a crowd of people.  

**Trip:**
Would you guys recommend some beautiful roads to drive and villages to visit along the way?  Perhaps places to hike or just walk around and see?  
I was thinking of Wegen because of what this guy posted: http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/292bab/if_you_travel_to_switzerland_i_would_highly/

Also, is Switzerland known for any culinary delicacies or wines/spirits/beers?  We are big foodies and would love to try something authentic.

My name is Matthew and I live in the United States. Over the past few years, my grand aunt (grandmother's sister) did genealogy research. I only see this aunt very few times a year: Thanksgiving (U.S. holiday) and a mini-family vacation that we take every September.

I asked her about what she had researched and if I could see the results. After some time, she sent an e-mail to my grandmother, who forwarded the e-mail to me. My family history is rather simple for several generations. My grandmother, her children, and her grandchildren (including myself) all live in Florida, whilst my grandmother's sisters and all of the generations above here live in Georgia (the state, not the country).

Anyway, this genealogy report goes 10 generations back and the ninth and tenth generations trace to Lützelflüh, Switzerland. There really isn't much information on these two people from Switzerland on why they immigrated to the United States.

The only information that I have is that Michael Burkhalter was probably born in Lützelflüh in an unknown year. Michael's son, Roudolph Burkhalter, was born in Lützelflüh in about 1732. Roudolph had a son named John Michael Burkhalter, who was born about 1755 in Georgia, U.S.

Unfortunately, there is a lot of information on these people missing from this document.

Anyway, I thought I would share some of my family history with some of you guys.

Is there anything interesting about Switzerland that you guys could mention? I am very interested in learning more about the country. I have read up on the national defense and the state of neutrality, especially during World War II.

Thanks for any comments made!


P.S. This document has Switzerland written as ""Switrzerland."" Is this a type of demonym or is it just a spelling mistake?

this year i want to spend our national holiday not in the city as usual but on a mountain. The idea is to hike somewhere during the day and then chill and watch the fireworks and höhenfeuer during the night.

I was thinking of Rigi or something, as there is a good view, but there are probably thousands of other people. Do you guys have any ideas for a place that is not as crowded as the typical toursit spots? I realize there is probably everywhere people, but a least i dont want to fight for my place :-)
