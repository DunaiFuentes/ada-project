Thank you everyone! :D


I would like to bring my little skateboard (I don't do tricks, I just ride smoothly,) and skate a bit so I don't get so tired walking. Do Swiss people, especially older ones, feel that skateboarders are annoying? How would the younger ones feel? What do police usually think of skateboarders? I would really love an honest answer so I know what to expect. 

I don't dress like a skater and I'm a very nice and very respectful person. Most skaters I know are the opposite, so I'm afraid of people judging me. I recently went to other countries (France, England,) and I definitely met some that had strong opinions on skateboarders (well, most of their dislike was on Americans that were ""annoying."") What can I do to prevent being annoying? 

Any insight on social rules would be very appreciated!
