I found my way here lurking around reddit and i have few questions for you as i am coming to Switzerland next week.

I'm coming there next week to spend our holiday with my SO watching my mom's dogs for a few weeks. Part of my family have been living at Switzerland for the past 10 years so they gave me some information about these things, but we are still trying to figure out what should we do with SO as we have alot of time during days. I have been at Switzerland multiple times so it's not a new place for me, but i havent really done anything special besides shopping, going swimming etc.

We are going to stay at Altstätten St. Gallen area and we have car during our stay to drive around with, taking into account that we have to take care of our dogs morning and evening, we can't be away for a whole day.

What is there to do within driving range? What we have already planned is to go shopping to St. Gallen central / there is shopping center near by at Austria and taking the ride up to Säntis. Around how much does the cable car up to Säntis cost and is there any better alternative mountais that we should propably visit instead? We are also concidering going to Zurich Zoo, but according to my parents it's not really worth going to see, is this true?

We are up for anything, we both are pretty open minded and want to explore Switzerland in general.
