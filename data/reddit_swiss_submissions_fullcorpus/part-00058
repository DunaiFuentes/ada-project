I have been offered a job in Zurich (I'm 32 years old), I would be moving there from Italy in 2 or 3 months, with my italian fiancee (that would give up her job to follow me there).

The yearly salary would be from 100.000 to 120.000 CHF (depening on how good I am to ask for more!).

Considering that my fiancee, at least for the first months, will not work, is that enough to live comfortably and save something?

What would be my monthly expenses?
Correct me if I'm wrong: I calculated around 2000-2500CHF for an apartment, 700CHF for the health insurance (for both of us), plus around 100CHF for internet\phone.
How much are the utilities there? Is the heating usually included in the rent?

What are some nice areas in Zurich (city) to look for an apt?
Is there something I'm forgetting or something I should really take into account?

Some local would like to win a free dinner and all my love and get in contact with me?

My wife was in Switzerland a few years ago for Christmas, visiting her sister who was doing an internship there. When she came back, she brought some tea from Coop which was some of the best tea either of us had ever had. On the website, it is called: 

&gt;""Coop Früchtetee aromatisiert assortiert 4 Sorten 20 Portionen 50g""/""Coop Assorted Flavoured Fruit Tea 4 Sampler 20 Tea Bags 50g""

[and this is what the box looks like](http://imgur.com/BZmnN).

I've looked high and low online and in town here but no such luck. There's even a Swiss store here that sells a lot of Swiss national brands, but I can't find this stuff anywhere, likely due to it being a in-house brand from a grocery store.

Anyway, I'd love to send some stuff from here (we're pretty well known for maple syrup) in exchange for a large case full of the teas I spoke of and linked above. My wife is pregnant now, and I would love to surprise her with a box of this stuff. Please feel free to contact me!
