Long shot I know... But I'm hoping someone will find it before the next storms come this weekend and bury it for the season. I left some contact info with the lift operator in le chable- if anyone has another idea of where to share this info let me know. 

The ski was a praxis great pacific octopus- white and purple and a ski pretty uncommon in the alps. 

Hope some other redditors are enjoying this new snow as well. If anyone wants to ski sometime let me know- good thing I have a few more pairs in the quiver!

Edit to show area of the crash: If you did that it would be awesome. My hope is that the ski ran away and is on/near the surface farther down- maybe even visible with good sunlight. A conditions report on how tracked out this zone is would be useful as well.

Yes, those are the skis linked.

Here is the zone of the crash. http://imgur.com/a/7gqQe

Just wondering if anyone has one lying around they don't use and would be willing to part with it for a more reasonable price/trade!

I only remember two things about the hotel. One, it had a gigantic swimming pool with an enormous anchor hanging from from the ceiling above the middle of the pool that you could swing off of. The other.....well......no one ever believes me. It had a trail going up a mountain. Along this trail arrows pointed up in fresh wood chips. About half way up, there was a little cave with a yellow rope across it. Inside the cave there were a bunch of kids toys almost set up like a display. I remember my family thinking it was so bizarre but we continued up. We reached the top of the trail and returned down. As we approached the cave again we could see the rope had been set aside and there was music playing from inside. When we looked inside the shallow cave I saw a little person? elf? troll? thing? draped in a blanket and shuffling to the music. It was terrifying. We ran in fear back to the hotel.

Do you know what is this new line on the total that says: ""Acompte relatif au Frais d'Import"" (= ""advance on fee related to importation taxes"")

As far as I've understood they taxes importation fees on Amazon side, so we should not have to pay when receving a parcel. If it's that, the good point is that you know in advance how much you will have to pay for importation fees, however they can charge more after purchase if the advance is not enough, so you still are not sure about the total amount of fees. The bad point is that it seams that Amazon taxes 0.20â‚¬ for each orders that would be taxe free, I suspect that they charge this service 20cts. Ok 20cts is not that much but it's still something and on the volume Amazon will probably make a lot of money out of that and you have no option to get you parcel the regular way.
On the help they don't talk about these fees on the Switzerland section but only on the section related to country outside of EU. I've order a lot on Amazon FR, sometimes on DE, UK and US and I've never seen this before as far as I remember.
