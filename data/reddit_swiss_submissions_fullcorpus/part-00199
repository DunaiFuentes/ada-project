I'm a 20 year old who's lived in Switzerland all his life, but because of personnal problems I couldn't get in a formation after obligatory school, and I want to finally start one now.

The thing is, I don't really know what job I want. I've done a few days in a bunch of very different domains, but nothing has touched my interest greatly. So now for my question, would it be better to just choose a job that seems ""tolerable"" for now and get a CFC, and then maybe branching somewhere else, or wait another year trying out other jobs until I find one I really like? I already feel a big amount of pressure because of my age and I don't really want to wait even more before starting something, but maybe launching myself into a job that I don't like that much is a bad idea.",false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,null,null,self,Choosing a career path?,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/2k9xuj/choosing_a_career_path/

My goal with this post is to gain a general understanding of some of the things to expect once I arrive. I'd also like to avoid any unnecessary hiccups that foreigners may experience. I have never been to Switzerland let alone Europe so my knowledge thus far has been limited to the articles and videos I have come across on the internet, most of them being tailored for tourism. Please keep in mind that I'm less concerned with trivial matters and am more interested in interpersonal experiences and other matters less prevalent on the internet. Below I will list some of my personal qualities that will most likely have an influence on my experience there followed by a few specific questions. 


About Me: Fluent French, Swiss citizen, early twenties (yes I am a citizen to a country I have never been to)


1. My ultimate goal is to find a way to act in French film. If you could provide any information or suggest a course of action you'll be greatly appreciated. I heard there's a film industry in Switzerland but from my understanding it's fairly small. 


2. Getting the most out of my money with a cell phone provider. I already have an iPhone 6 that supposedly will work in Europe. I'm just looking for the most bang for my buck when I inevitably make the switch. If Switzerland is anything like the United States not all cell service providers are created equal.


3. Finally and by far most importantly, where are the beautiful young ladies my age? And generally speaking do you find them to be impartial to Americans?
