What about a beautiful resort up in the mountains? or some kind of historic hotel? We only have one night in Geneva but I'd rather not just stay in a typical hotel that could be anywhere in the world.
I don't really have too much of a budget, but I do want to keep it under 200Euro per night.

I'm considering moving to Switzerland. I have a company and I work at home (except the occasional business trip) and after reading information it seems that getting residence in Switzerland would be easy for me based on my income.

Now, the reason I want to move to Switzerland is that since I can live anywhere, I would like to live in an European country with the lowest criminality possible. Because statistics don't tell the full story I would like some opinions from Swiss people. I've read online that Switzerland is not what it used to be when it comes to personal safety, and Norway seems to beat Switzerland in some statistics (like murder rate). Of course, there are things that the statistics don't tell me

a) Are there cantons that are more safe than others? Couldn't find any information about this in English.
b) In your opinion is Switzerland the safest place in Europe?

Even though Norway seems to have better stats it could be that crime in Switzerland occurs generally among criminals, for example. I read some comments online from Swiss citizens very concerned about a recent rise in criminality. Should I take those seriously or is it a case of ""the grass is always greener...""

I'm just trying to reconcile conflicting information to make an educated decision. I'm from Spain and Spain has a murder rate of 0.7/100,000, Switzerland 0.6/100,000. Considering what I know about Switzerland I find it very hard to believe that it's so close!

I don't care about anything else, I don't want to go to Switzerland to evade taxes or anything like that, I'm happy to pay my share.
