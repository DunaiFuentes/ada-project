I've grown pretty fond of the weissbier since moving to Switzerland.  

It is sold in most markets and at most restaurants and bars.  Most markets have a refrigerated area, where they sell cold cans of beer.  Normally they have things like Heineken and Feldschlosschen and whatnot.  Often they will even have Budweiser or Corona.

But never any weissbier.   

At first I thought maybe it was just a quirk of one particular store or chain, but now I've looked in pretty much every chain and a good deal of small shops in Zurich and have been unable to find even one that sells refrigerated weissbier.
