I am moving to Zurich for a minimum of 3-4 years in April. I am an American and lived in Zurich and Geneva as a child (total of 4 years). My parents are also American. No Swiss blood.

I have read about the 12 years residence requirement to file for naturalisation but as a child the years lived in Switzerland count as double? I cannot seem to find anything at the Federal or Canton level that elaborates on this policy definitively. 

Therefore, my question is do the 4 years spent in Zurich and Geneva as a dependent of foreign parents count double (so 8 years or count at all)? How would I go about evidencing this?
