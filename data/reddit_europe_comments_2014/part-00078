No, because the example, and thus the logical conclusion, was Kosovo, therefor Crimea will not be brought before these courts, because it would show the emperor (USA/NATO/EU) is not wearing clothes.

I understand I was trying to explain it in the least amount of words possible. I chose gold only as a comparison to the new inflated currency's value. It could have easily have been real dollars or real euros or one of many other measures. 

&gt;As for the hyperinflation, it is a bogeyman to ensure people who should not care about inflation abide to the interests of the parasitic financial sector.

I am not saying policies of central banks right now will cause anything near hyperinflation. In fact, I *strongly* support the ECB initiating a meaningful round of quantitative easing. Right now, much of Europe is forced to live with a monetary policy tailored to Germany's economy. 

I was responding to the author's idiotic notion that ""The Bank of England's dose of honesty throws the theoretical basis for austerity out the window"". He is ultimately suggesting that central banks can print their way out of any problem, and pretty much ignores any effects that would have on the value of the currency. 

I am definitely not one of the ""QE will cause hyperinflation"" crowd. In fact I am the opposite, especially in the Eurozone.

Secondly, Geopolitics is not really supposed to be a tool by which you would incisively analyze current events- its mostly meant to be a tool to understand changes across a long term mostly as trends influenced quite a bit by geography. Aka: why was America bound to be a superpower, why was America more likely to defeat the USSR despite the latter's size (resources, geography, reach, access to both major oceans, etc.) 

What people are messing up nowadays is that they think this analytical tool, geopolitics, most often used to explain long-term trends is now being mistaken for plain power politics- it doesn't take a guy with a PhD who spent his entire life researching history to see how geography affects politics to realise that Crimea is geographically valuable for Russia. Yet people keep commenting on it like its all thanks to ""geopolitics"" that now we know why Russia wants crimea- geopolitics is only one part of the bigger picture and its mostly a macro-scale historical tool. 

For example: if Crimea didn't have any russian population then they wouldn't have taken it. Yet no geopolitics could explain why they couldn't take it. What geopolitics would help explain and what its meant to be used as is as an analytical tool to explain *why* Crimea would have so many russians in the first place (eg: historically important, kievan rus was nearby, bound to be dominated by the nation to the east which has the most natural resources and the most potential for expansion in the region and the least enemies after the eventual weakening of the mongols, also the nation that didn't have any other warm water ports which thus made crimea all the more important for them and other regional powers like Poland/Lithuania are too surrounded/preoccupied with other issues to be as invested into Crimea, the Bulgars, Magyars and Byzantines/Greeks were at crossroads between west and east and thus too busy to really focus on crimea and didn't need it tbh, the middle eastern powers wouldn't have needed it as much since they had the Mediterranean and Aegean, etc.) 

Its not a great explanation but I hope you understand now why that subreddit is sort of flawed- it tries to apply geopolitics to real world events as if its some sort of miracle mindset when instead thats just plain old power politics/realpolitik which include a lot more variables and thus is more accurate in immediate terms. Geopolitics is primarily a macro and historical tool, and shouldn't be confused with the consideration of geography in politics (eg: such as why China wouldn't wanna give up Tibet or Xinjiang *right now* is consideration of geography in politics, why China ends up having Tibet or Xinjiang in the first place/why there isn't a counter-state there to stop chinese expansion would be something geopolitics could try and explain.)

Invaded a sovereign nation whos borders it agreed to respect. 

I am not saying NATO expansion is good. In fact it costs US taxpayers billions per year *and* many Europeans see US troops as imperialist. I will be the last person defending it.

Russia is not as innocent as you make them out though. They are very in tune with their national interests, and act on them regardless of what conflict it causes. The conflicts you brought up earlier, Kosovo, etc. had heavy Russian involvement. 

Libya was a European issue, blaming intervention there on NATO seems a bit unfair. the UK and France unilaterally decided the ""human rights abuses in Libya can not continue."" Translated: the EU gets a lot of its oil from Libya so we need to intervene. The US (by far the largest provider of NATO capability) was trying to sit the conflict out. The highest ranking officials from the UK and France went to Washington to ask for assistance. So essentially it was a European intervention under the guise of a NATO intervention. 

Even the most damning evidence, Nuland's ""fuck the EU"" phone call isn't that bad. She was trying to get Yanokovich, opposition leaders, and the UN to the negotiating table. She originally pressured the EU to be more involved but they declined. They are more involved now, but in typical EU fashion they're late as usual. I thought the call was fairly helpful in showing the US was not being as one sided as Russian media would have you believe. 

This conflict was caused by an EU trade deal. This had nothing to do with the US. The US and EU were treating Russia as a more viable trade partner (as evidenced by pending free trade agreements between Russia and the EU and US). 

If you're so concerned with EU nation alignments you need to speak with the respective governments. Former USSR states near the EU have ultimately decided to align themselves with the EU. There are more benefits with this than aligning themselves with Russia. Belarus is a glaring example, and compare the quality of life there to other Eastern European countries aligned with the EU.

You are *definitely* an America hater. There is nothing to be ashamed of, you're in good company on this sub, especially 3 weeks ago. I am not as worried as you. The US spends a ton on R&amp;D. It has great universities and companies that attract top talent. Despite what you read on /r/europe, the US does many things right as well. But you speak about conspiratorial news sources against Russia but dont take into account conspiratorial sources against the US. 

There are many indicators that point to a bright future. One being its acceptance of immigrants. While many developed countries deal with declining populations, the US population is steady because of immigration. And those immigrants are not just replacing the older generation through numbers, but they're very successful. There is a very developed venture capital infrastructure in place that funds new companies, and cities and states are setting up funds to help new businesses get of the ground. Even Texas, the state Europeans like to make fun of for being the ultimate hillbillies, has a half a billion dollar fund for new tech start ups (along with countless other funds to help start ups). 

You are more than entitled to your opinion. And personally, I think NATO expansion eastward should never have happened. I think the EU should have dealt with any expansionary problems. But then you have issues like now, where the EU is dealing with expansionary problems and the first thing they do is back off. This is *after* they caused the problem in the first place. 

So I dont have the doomsday vision you do for the US. Assuming the American idiots you see in European press speak for the US is similar to assuming Geert Wilders speaks for the Netherlands. 

You seem to hold the EU in high regard. If they expect to be considered international players they need to act as if they are. They enter into these risky deals (Ukraine-EU trade) and then back out at the first sign of trouble leaving others to clean up the mess.

At some level that is the state with Crimea and Ukraine as a whole. In a war what infrastructure Ukraine is, is likely done for.  Plus all those Ukrainian troops in bases on Crimea are just hostages.  They're dead the moment the shooting starts. Whereas Ukraine sans Crimea is still functional.  Odessa can function as Ukraine's main port.  

This means that Crimea can be temporarily lost to Ukraine.  The big thing is temporarily.  Not just given to Russia like Austria was given to Germany, but lost temporarily.  Russia is suspended from the G8, only the Russian puppets recognize Crimea as Russian, etc.  In the mean time various intelligence agencies work to foster anti-Russian feelings in Crimea.  All of Europe and the USA work to undermine the Russian economy at the same time Ukraine is aided.  So the Ukrainian economy grows while the Russians experience contractions and instability, leaving people in Crimea to wonder if maybe they aren't part of the wrong country.  Hard to rally a pro Russian militia when Russia put you in the poor house.  In Russia proper, Putin's support should also erode as the economy falters.     

It gives Europe a chance to ease itself off its gas problem and avoid economic instability and a war in which Ukraine and perhaps Baltics get mauled pretty badly (even if we're just talking a conventional one here).

Of course this only works if you believe that NATO/EU can actually stick to their principles on this and maintain a unified policy in undermining Russia.  Economic actions against Russia, continued support for covert work in Crimea, and general support for building up Eastern Europe.  Whereas if you believe that in a couple years this will be water under the bridge, France will be selling the Russians warships again, etc, then you might as well just go ahead and have the war as opposed to letting Putin consolidate his claims and move forward.  

It also really only works so long as Crimea is really all that goes.  If the next step is pro-Russian militias become even more active in Eastern Ukraine and ""self defense forces"" appear there, then clearly Putin does not intend to leave Ukraine as a functional state and it is time to intervene militarily.  

West Germany did just fine without the eastern part and eventually got it back without having to have a shooting war.  Whereas obviously there eventually was a war over concessions to Germany for Austria, Czechoslovakia, Memel, and Danzig.  Better minds than mine need to figure out if economic warfare can ensure this Crimea grab is just a temporary little masturbatory session by Putin that fucks him the long run or if it is the first domino to fall.",0,1395206880,null,0,false,0,cg6an2j,t3_20r1uk,t1_cg6an2j,t3_20r1uk,null,1432971438,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Nor are they the ones who are planning on moving thousands of soldiers, ships and jets near China. Nor are they the ones engaged in political games in ASEAN to weaken China's influence in SE Asia. The relationship between China and the West is purely economical and political rivarly. With Russia it's one of friendship because Russia and China share the same goals. 

This is the thing with international disputes. You can't have your cake and eat it too. The US is a superpower and it has to deal with the consequences of being one. China is rising and America wants to contain. They also made a lot of promises to Asian countries back when China was weak. Those countries are calling in those promises. The US has to respond otherwise their superpower status. China sees that as a threat just as Russia sees Ukraine and Georgia joining NATO a threat. This is why Obamas mission to Beijing to convince the Chinese to back them failed.


The biggest thorn in Russia-China relations was the territorial disputes which Mao screwed up. Russia and China have already sorted it out. The fact is that China has no real friends. They screwed it up in the past and Russia is the closest thing they have to an ally. They're not going to do anything to screw that. Take fishing for example. If a Chinese fishermen is caught illegally fishing in neighbouring waters the Chinese government fans the flames of nationalism. The Russians caught some and destroyed their boat, way worse than what the Japanese or others have done. When Chinese media started to go all nationalistic, the government shat on them in hours.

If they really wanted to, they could have leveraged autonomy years ago. But they know that autonomy would end their 25 year reign as kings of the magyars.

As the article pointed out, economic sanctions against Russia would entail a backlash that would hurt the home country's economic growth, and increase the already painful aspects of the recession.

So it's possible that instead of being wholly subservient to business leaders (not to say that they don't have a strong influence, after all), it's possible that a country's leader is also considering how the sanctions would weigh on the home country's economic growth, and the after-effects that its own citizens would feel. Then they balance this against those universal democratic values.

I think the calculus they use leads to the outcome that they consider their own citizens to be more important than the people in Crimea, or Ukraine. After all, say, a German politician first and foremost owes their allegiance to their own people before another country's. Or at least, that's what I imagine how they feel. Once all is said and done, they figure it's better to sit this one out and pray another country picks up the slack, because to do otherwise would hurt your own citizens, to help another group that you don't owe anything explicit too. 

Sure, you're throwing out some of those universal democratic values that you purport to espouse, but again, I think their rationale leads them to conclude that the effects of a sanction are too painful for their own citizens to bear, for any potential upside that may come of it.

First of all, thank you for doing this. It's great to have politicians engaging with the community.

I'm a UK national who's now living in the Netherlands, and am pleased to be voting for [Groenlinks](https://groenlinks.nl/) in our local elections here in Ede, tonight. I also received a letter yesterday to declare that I would be voting for the European Parliament elections here in the Netherlands which I've signed and returned today. I'm keen to stay involved in European democracy. When I lived in the UK, I did some leafletting for the Liberal Democrats and wrote to my MP several times.

However...

I'm somewhat disillusioned with the state of our democratic system. I see what I cannot help but judge as regressive laws being passed all around the world, including in the UK and in Europe. Corruption and cronyism seems to be everywhere, and our environment always seems to be a low priority.

I would *love* to get involved with a party determined to fight for a progressive, environmentally aware society. My current thoughts are that parties like yours and Groenlinks here in the Netherlands may be what I'm looking for, and I'm considering voting accordingly in the EU elections.

Can you comment on what you would like to improve in the democratic process in the EU?

How can we combat growing Euroskepticism and keep the Union together? (I personally believe this is essential to maintaining peace within and outside of the European area).

What are your policies for combating global warming and preserving our environment, while maintaining a sustainable economy?

A couple procedural questions that I can't seem to understand.

As a rapporteur, you receive opinions from the concerned committees. It is my understanding that you have the amendments they propose into consideration when you write your draft report. but then:

1. How are those opinions handled in committee? Does the committee vote for the block of amendments proposed in the opinion? For them individually? Or just for the ones you selected?

2. I noticed that the formal document forwarded to the council contains the opinions, are they just attached to the doc for clarity's sake? So there is a sort of consolidated document? Or does it mean they have some sort of use (for instance to reuse in the second reading)?

3. Generally I am a bit confused as to what happens to an opinon after it is sent from one committee to the next. From the different texts I've read they never seem to actually get adopted. Is this generally true?

4. What procedural rule do you think should be changed/modernized?

also, unrelated:

Basically if the gas comes from Russia, every time Russia does something you don't agree upon, you're a bit more limited in which actions you can take against it, because they got the gas you rely on, and you don't.

Other possible reasons for where the gas comes from is important, could be environmental reasons, huge building projects of gas lines can cause environmental issues, such as when building the Nord Stream pipeline through the Baltic sea. Keeping your energy sources more local reduce the need for these. There might also be a problem with the harvesting/mining methods of Russia but I honestly haven't heard of such.

No, I see the value in academics and its important that universities keep this up both in humanities, art, and science. Understanding the world has a huge value for us a society even if it doesn't necessarily lead to material gains. 

&gt; I'm not saying that we should stop educating pure academics, but maybe reducing the number of available places in these disciplines will lead to a lot of people choosing more sensibly.

To quote myself :P

What I'm saying is that too many young people get the opportunity to choose a path that will lead to overeducation and no job opportunities. It doesn't help them (apart from in self-realization) and it doesn't help academics (because only the best will reach the level where they will actually contribute). A lot of people should be led to more practical education. Sure you could do it with career counseling, but it would be much easier to just adapt the number of accepted students more to the needs of society /the job market. You could adapt the education system in such a way that education *will* lead to a job in most cases.

Here's another

Its justification rings just as hollow as it did four years ago when Russia de facto annexed the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Sound policy, however, can only be based on sound analysis of the players involved. That requires conceding the point -- even when made by the Kremlin -- that more than a few of the protesters who toppled Yanukovych, and of the new leaders in Kiev, are fascists.""*

I guess only Western/Central European nations have come closest to implementing due process of secession that is effective both for the seceding party and the parent nation. Through an electoral process that engages the populace on all possible aspects that need to be considered and also high-level negotiations that ensure that any conclusions or decisions are made in the interests of both parties. It is a process that takes years, and doesn't always end with secession. But what it always achieves is more autonomy for regions without having to sacrifice self-determination for association with a parent nation, and vice versa. I guess the Scottish example would be the clearest indication of this. Or so is Slovene secession. Or, to Serbia's credit, Montenegrin secession,

On the other hand, the Crimean example is simply that of a land grab. If the Crimeans actually wanted independence, then it would have been a cause that could be sympathised with. But to secede from a nation only to become the subject of another? That is no longer an independence struggle and it just becomes power politics. There was no proper public dialogue that engaged the Ukranians and the Tatars in the Crimea; if anything they were excluded and suppressed. And the Russian military intervention was unjustified; there was neither perpetrated violence or even, initially, an unwillingness by Ukranian authorities to discuss Crimean autonomy. Now the result is that a region literally defected and the consequences are that it severed economic ties with a major neighbour, consequently being dependent of subsidies from Moscow which cannot go on indefinitely and, most peculiarly, end up with even less autonomy and self-determination under a Russian Federation that allows only symbolic autonomy, versus the case within the Ukraine where it was a quasi-independent state. 

And in the case of Kosovo, it can only be treated with the state of civil war in consideration. It is a long story and I trust you know most of the details already. But the important point that was decisive in securing eventual Kosovo independence was not the late-90s ethnic violence or even the NATO bombing, but the suppression of the Albanian identity within Kosovo in the early-90s following the rise of Serbian nationalism. This pretty much cemented the perception of *us and them* and thus it was inevitable that a majority Albanian region would reject being part of a nation that considers itself purely Serbian and, inversely, that certain Serbians knew that such a region would not be fully Serbian until the demographics were altered. 
Thus, Kosovo would have eventually achieved independence one way or another. Montenegro did after all. The violence and the bombing was just the inevitable by product of a messy civil war that was simply getting out of hand.

The protection of local brands and quality brands is a central issue of the negotations of the TTIP, the free exchange agreement with the US. Our main goal,as Europeans, is to avoid to have the market flooded by sub-quality products, which being cheaper would kill our quality production, especially when done by SMEs,which is the sector we want to dominate. We are not talking champagne, massively produced: we are talking about smaller products. We protect Parmigiano, and the jobs related to it, but also the smaller European producers of ""sottomarca"", which can often claim the same quality, and ensure jobs at a smaller level.

As italians, these issues are even more important. Food is at the center of not only our exports, but also our tourism. It is entrenched with the experience we offer.

You cannot claim ""great food, great tradition"" when your abbacchio could be cloned and pumped with antibiotics, coming from Africa(Yes, the US does not track their export meat, and the little they do is nearly useless, at least according to EU standards, which are not even that strict). But the owner of a trattoria, the day we open the market indiscriminately to US products, could chose the cheaper option, which will easily be suboptimal, and he wouldn't even know.

Of course, there are great American productions, and not all pumped with crap. And we want a lot of good American products, they are just amazing. But their food industry is INSANE. We just cannot afford to let a giant like America, with much more capital available to invest in massive production, compete with our system of production, unless we want our products and our ""diversity"" that we like to sell, gone very fast. We need protection to keep up our whole model, not much to enjoy it ourselves, but because that is what we sell to foreigners who come and visit us every year, by the millions. It's business babe.

From the European consumer side...yeah, let's say that after years of consumer protection oriented food regulation, for those who care, now that our children are starting to have obesity problems, we are not dying to flood our markets with corn syrup/antibiotics/pesticides-full CHEAP food. That is just not where we want to go. It would expose the poorest part of the population to health problems which would weigh on our public national health system, which we cannot overburden further.

So yeah, France is looking ludicrous by claiming they want to protect their ""artistic"" industry, with their indiscriminately subsidized movies (only some deserve that protection) that just a few watch and books that nobody reads anymore (for reference, there was a recent article on BBC http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25198154): many believe that the negotiations are very difficult because of this mythical ""French exception"" thay talk about.

IdR werden Umgangsformen bei der Kontaktaufnahme auch eingehalten, weil sie zum Abchecken dienen, ob du ein passendes Opfer bist. Man benutzt die Ansprache nicht nur zum Distanz überwinden, sondern auch um zu erspüren, ob du das passende Zielobjekt bist. Und wenn du nicht ins Raster passt, kann der Täter gelassen weitergehen, ohne bereits eine versuchte Straftat begangen zu haben. 

Du kannst auch ruhig schwächer sein, aber wenn der Typ denkt, dass du ihm ernsthaft Gegenwehr oder Probleme machen könntest, nimmt er oft lieber Abstand. Man will ja als Täter idR keinen Kampf, sondern was anderes. 

&gt;Aber genau das ist in meinen Augen der Haken, es gaukelt einem die Sicherheit vor, sie ist jedoch nicht wirklich da. 

Vorgaukeln kann aus meiner Sicht helfen. Wie in der Biologie zur Abwehr von Fressfeinden. :-) Auch ein Pfefferspray in der Tasche, den du vielleicht nie benutzt, kann dir psychologisch den ""breiteren"" Auftritt beim Gehen geben, den Räuber (oder andere Gewalttäter) dann lieber ein anderes Opfer aussuchen lassen. Oder feste Schuhe tragen statt barfuß in Flip-Flops. 

Einbrecher sind da ja ähnlich: Das können auch Kleinigkeiten am Haus sein, dass sie sagen ""Nö, lieber beim Nachbarn schauen"". Bild vom Schäferhund mit ""Hier Wache ich"", etc. 

Das alles gilt natürlich nur für Zufallsbegegnungen, nicht für persönliche Feindschaften.

&gt; Ma la criminalità 2.0 non è fatta solo di droga. È fatta anche di hacker, che si chiamano cracker (da crack), che si intrufolano nei computer, negli IPhone, negli IPad

è vero che l'origine è il verbo to crack, aprire forzosamente, e dal programma per trovare le password degli utenti su Unix, che appunto si chiamava Crack. 

E nell'articolo non dice esplicitamente che intende crack come droga, però è facile cascarci.

Ready to conquer the whole island, **they were however forced to return to Tunisia by a Berber revolt**. A second attack in 752 aimed **only to sack** the same city. [...] The conquest was a see-saw affair; with considerable resistance and many internal struggles, **it took over a century for Byzantine Sicily to be conquered**. Syracuse held out for a long time but fell in 878, Taormina fell in 902, and **the last Byzantine outpost was taken in 965**.

Però ultimamente hanno iniziato a darmi davvero fastidio, per come operano. Due episodi su tutti:

* Fiera universitaria di Verona, anno scorso. Un esercito di volontari della onlus Il Pellicano (cercando su internet, globalmente riconosciuta come truffatrice) blocca i visitatori ad ogni angolo, chiede donazioni con insistenza utilizzando trucchetti squallidi per fare sentire in colpa la gente. Ad un certo punto, esasperato, acconsento a fare una donazione, apro il portafoglio e tiro fuori un euro. La tipa mi guarda sconcertata: ""Ma tu hai molto di più, potresti donare qualcosina d'altro"". Al che rispondo ""Sono i soldi della cassa comune della classe, servono per i biglietti del treno, non posso darli via"". Dopo un lungo braccio di ferro ha acconsentito alla ""misera"" donazione, mi ha fatto una ricevuta di malavoglia; speravo che fosse finita, invece appena fatto mi ferma un suo compagno: ""Buongiorno, sono della Pellicano Onlus..."". Esibisco trionfante la mia ricevuta (che a quanto ne so per il regime fiscale delle onlus non vale un cazzo di niente) e lui mi fa: ""No, io raccolgo fondi per un altro progetto."" Lì sono scappato, non ne potevo più.

* A Trento invece agiscono giovani che vendono immaginette realizzate da loro, dal valore effettivo di pochi centesimi, e si presentano come appena usciti da comunità di recupero. Chiedono molti soldi e sono insistenti e violenti; una volta, cercando di ignorarne uno, sono stato strattonato e tenuto fermo da uno di questi).

More like Pro democracy. The western media keeps spinning the EU/Western Part They're just sick and tired of the corruption. They would ally with the devil if it meant an improvement of living standards, economic recovery and decent politicians.

The west is just MAD because Russia can annex territory and they can't. Honestly I'm not too mad at the Russians. I think they should have the right to annex shit that was theirs for centuries before WW1 and WW2 and pretty much has 90% Russian population. 

The irony in all of this is Russia helped the West in Syria. International law was followed and everything was ok. The west broke so many international laws with Iraq,Libya, Afghanistan and so on... and Israel by international law shouldn't even exst. They break it daily if only in Israel.

So it's really silly how Americans are shouting YOU'RE BREAKING THE LAW. But when they do it it's because ""they need to stop a dictator he has WMDs"" or ""prevent a humanitarian crisis"" bal bla all that rhetoric. Basically when it suits them because they have the economy and the weapons to back up their rethoric hell western media can also be the strongest propaganda in the world. Be it true or not.

When Russia does the same. Says it wants to protect it's people from a corrupt Ukrainian government, BAM it's against the law. I'm not saying what they're doing is okay. I'm 100% sure that Crimean president and all of them there are corrupt as fuck people tied to some mafia or gangs that got into power because Putin felt like it but damn. It's so silly to hear the west complain about it like this when they did even worse things like a few years ago. How many arab countries were bombed to the stone age and set back 10 or 20 years economically and socially.

true,doctorheredoctor,BELG,Belgium,"&gt;They throw out (without elections) a pro-Russia government

I'm not aware of how much of the government was ""thrown out"".  The president fled and:

&gt;On 22 February 2014, 328 of 447 members of the Ukrainian parliament (MPs)—or about 73% of the MPs—voted to ""remove Viktor Yanukovych from the post of president of Ukraine"" and hold early presidential elections on 25 May.

But this procedure violated the constitution adopted under Yanukovich's control; while 338 votes were required, only 328 were made.

What percentage of parliament has either fled, been dismissed, replaced, removed etc?  Has the government really been thrown out or did the parliament remain largely intact and oust the exiled president?


&gt;Therefore, some suggest we should react as soon as possible.

At the very least it needs to be made clear that the next ""self-defense force"" which pops up on a Russian bordering country will face immediate military response from a combined European force. This is of course a political impossibility.  I'm not sure it's the best action either.

----------------------------------

If I had to tweak your list of events:

1) What began as a pro-Western demonstration in Ukraine ended as an anti-establishment revolution.  Some European leaders openly show support for regime change. The parliament illegally removes from power the pro-Russian president (that drastically altered the constitution after having been democratically elected, arguably going far beyond the mandate of his elected role, some claiming this invalidates his democratic legitimacy).

2) Russia is angry, but has already prepared for this situation. While the Russian president claims he will respect Ukraine's territorial integrity, moves are made to seize control of the Crimea.  EU, Ukraine and Russia negotiate about a compromise during this seizure.  Claims of threats to ethnic Russians seem unfounded.

3) A compromise is either not reached or not respected by all parties involved while the Crimea is occupied.

4) Russia annexes a part of Ukraine with the excuse that it is protecting people from a fascist government. That part of Ukraine has a large pro-Russian population, but true support for annexation is impossible to judge after a flawed referendum and concerted propaganda effort by the pro-Russian side.

true,23PowerZ,EURO,European Union,"While it's evident the annexation is a breach of international law, I think this policy of imposing sanctions on Russia is bound to fail. Putin literally couldn't care less. The only thing really hurting Russia's economy would be for Europe to stop buying Russian gas. But that hurts Europe way more than Russia, so this is no option.

For the first time in decades the West has something Russia wants, political recognition of Crimea's annexation. There is no way Russia will just undo it, so there is no gain in passive opposition. In my opinion, the reasonable approach is to get as much out of this as possible. While the West could just spend the next 50 years not recognizing the annexation, there will be no value in recognizing a long standing status quo, but now there is. The question should be: What does the West want from Russia? Few things come to mind: Russia to stop backing separatists in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Transnistria along with affirmation of non-intervention in Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Moldova for instance.

I don't think Russia will just give up on the option of further intervention in Ukraine for Crimea. This can only be achieved by mutually assuring non-intervention, which also means no NATO nor EU membership for Ukraine. But this is actually the right thing in my opinion. Ukraine is divided 50/50 into pro Russia and pro West, any one sided approach will piss off half the population. We have in fact just witnessed this leading to a revolution. The policies regarding Ukraine over the past decade of both, Russia and EU/NATO, have always been either Russia or EU/NATO, while it should actually be either both or none, as long as this domestic dispute isn't settled.

They do affect the value of a currency.The notion that central banks can essentially print their way out of any problem is not only completely false, but deliberately misleading.

There are many viewpoints and I'm having little to no trouble in accepting author's interpretation. If we look at actuality we have two ''unprecedented and experimental'' courses set, one deployed by FED and BoJ and to extent by BoE and another pushed by ECB. 

Perhaps you'd agree that your notion that central banks can't ''print economies out of malaise'' is opposed by polices now active in US or Japan? That is, it's clear that we have policymakers there who decided to push on with ''unprecedented'' easing (money creation) in effort to kick-start real economies. 
 
In essence it really boils down to choice, European leaders (elites, if you prefer) decided to find some ''sound foundations'' while others embarked on crating trillions. I think we'd be better off, globally, if EU took the same course instead of paddling in opposite directions and in spite clear signs we'll end-up with deflation.

Article we're commenting on suggest that raison d'être for austerity is based upon ''imaginary debt'', it is accurate and in mainstream rarely seen interpretation of our reality. Instead of banks, people should have ability to take single euro and transmute it into hundred or thousand euros with no strings attached.

Same with Crimea. Another super power could take a piece of land and they are doing it because they can.

But propaganda, propaganda and more propaganda from your government and you all fools start believing that you are 'on the right side', 'they are insane', 'we must fight for justice' etc. you start hating Russians/Americans/Serbians/whoever.

This is how wars start, leaders manipulate the common people into believing whatever they want and it leads to terrible things.

Why the fuck can't you all understand that, it's not that hard, we have been killing each other for the last 50 000 years, and now with all the tech and shit we achieved, we still have so many people that believe in stupid things like 'Russia wants to help Crimea because there are Russians there' or 'USA wants to defend Crimea because they want to protect the territorial integrity of Ukraine', 'They have right to fight because the other side broke the international law'...

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; One of its chief demands -- that all government business be done in Ukrainian -- was passed into law, instantaneously marginalizing the one-third of Ukraine's citizens (and 60 percent of Crimeans) who speak Russian. 

So much instantaneously wrong in just one sentence. 

**Firstly**, there was no such new law. The writers present the whole issue backwards. The issue was about *repealing* an earlier unconstitutional law. Which did not happen either. The lopsided *Ukrainian Law on Language Policy of 2012* pushed forward by Yanukovich is still in effect.

**Secondly**, the law had been adopted illegally and uncostitutionally. That's why it was among the 300 or so acts and laws to be repealed for the same reason. But the PM said that despite the law being poor it is still better to keep it in effect until a better law is prepared, and upheld it.

**Thirdly**, the Ukrainian Law on Language Policy of 2012 was not a good law to begin with. Both the law and its illegal adoption were heavily criticized by relevant watchdogs, scholars, representatives of other minorities and ministeries as lopsided, substandard, and disproportionally favouring one language.

In 2012 the law was [criticized](http://www.uaba.org/resources/Documents/Blog%20Docs/12-08-23%20Amb%20Vollebaek%20Letter%20to%20Ukrainian-Am%20%20Bar%20Assoc_16%20Aug.pdf) by the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities as its *""approach to language policy is deeply divisive and is likely to lead to future polarization of society. Indeed, the disproportionate favoring of the Russian language, while also removing most incentives for learning or using Ukrainian in large parts of the country, could potentially undermine Ukraine’s very cohesion""*. He was also concerned that the legislation was not adopted in accordance with Ukrainian constitutional and procedural law. 

The Council of Europe stated ([1](http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=CDL-REF%282011%29001-e), [2](http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=CDL%282011%29101-e)) that the legislation failed to provide a proper balance between the development and use of a state language as a unifying factor in society and the development and protection of minority languages in accordance with European standards. 

The law was also criticized by Ukrainian legal scholars, the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and other academic institutions, and numerous ministeries within the Yanukovych government as divisive and failing to protect the rights of all Ukrainians irrespective of their ethnic background. 

**And finally**, if repealing a poor law which has been heavily critized by human rights watchdogs and other relevant instances is touted as an example of a 'fascist' policy the writers are really reaching for the bottom of the barrel for such examples. The reality is that there are no examples of 'fascist' policies on the new government actions nor on its program.

* It would begin from Russian strategic attack against Helsinki where Russians would hit strategic targets like communication infrastructure with missiles which would be followed by landing of airborne troops who would quickly take over large parts of the city and occupy government facilities.

Mining is easy, that is why it is done. In case of the Russia Baltic Fleet, it is not any more in its former glory, I don't see how it could prevent Finnish from mining the Baltic Sea.

In case of the Russian air force, yes it is big, but the thing is that it can't be all allocated against Finland as it is needed in to defend/guard other parts of Russia. Not to mention that Russian air force doesn't have an impressive record, in Georgian war they couldn't even get air superiority from Georgians.

In case of blockading the country, this is the reason why for the Finnish state the matter of food security has been so important. You see Finland is self sufficient in food production and it has large stockpile of not only oil and other needed commodities, but also enough grain etc.. so that whole population can be feed from one harvest to another and have enough seeds for one cultivation.

They were illegal when they illegally scaled Spanish borders without a valid visa. Anyway, the vast majority of asylum seekers in Europe are bogus. Being from a developing country is not grounds for asylum.

&gt;Second, putting them in jail until they cooperate will cost more than allowing them to work and live in society.

There are over 20 million EU citizens unemployed. These illegals are mostly unskilled and lack the relevant language skills. You will need to provide them with education, training, language support, housing, medical care and a modest welfare stipend for day to day essentials. Even then, few will find work.

&gt;Third, the Australian solution is terribly inhumane and is more akin to WW2 era concentration camps, than regular prisons.

A trite comparison. 

&gt;Frankly, there is no good solution, unless you propose to cancel the UN refugee agreement. And even that's not a good solution, because then what are you going to do? You can't send them back, if they've burnt their identification and the destination they set out from doesn't accept them back. Are you going to put them in inhumane prisons? What is your solution here?

They are illegal trespassers. If they destroy their documents, fine. We can get linguists to interview them and see where they come from. If that doesn't work, they can rot in jail until they cooperate. The word will quickly spread - it's not worth your while migrating illegally to the EU. Very rapidly.

If their countries wont take them back, then the EU should cut development aid to these places and apply stringent visa measures on their citizens. When the politicians in these countries find it difficult to visit Paris or London for a shopping trip, they will soon change their tune.

&gt;I just want people to understand the immense legal and moral, let alone economic, complexity of the situation. If you could come up with a good solution, I would be more than happy to hear it. But most people don't offer solutions, just bullshit rhetoric.

Lets cut to the brass tax. You don't believe in border controls. You probably don't believe in nation states or national sovereignty.

Hidalgo is someone who is afraid to hold a single debate against her opponent. Her career was making sure that French employers couldn't work because being rich is bad and dirty. Then when she got tired of that, she retired at 50 and decided that she wanted to sail through the incompetency of the PS in the shadow of Delanoe ( because really, if you find anybody who's competent there, he's probably gone ) so she slept around and managed to get to the top. Paris is a metropolis and if there is one thing it shouldn't be is run by someone who lived by and for the Socialist French inertia of delaying change and refusing to see the world as it is because everybody is wrong but us. As for her ""green"" walkway, we ( people who lived in Paris ) all know how that ends. More and longer traffic elsewhere because people will still need to go to work and reducing the number of road space will never work ( outright ban and free parking might though ). 

NKM is an unsufferable know-it-all who's acting the character she really is : a pampered princess who never left her palace. Daughter to a long time politician, sister to a successful start-up tycoon, used the school system to the top of the French hierarchy by going to the top engineering school so she could do what ? Serve one of the worst example of state kleptocracy France has seen in the last 50 years as minister and spokeswoman. Alienate everyone and anybody with buzzwords and stupid ideas because she seems to believe that politics is pretending, pretending, pretending. One could write a dictionary with a list of ""that's never gonna happen"" ideas which are managing to sink her campaign on their own. Parisians don't need to dream, they want a good manager as a mayor that isn't gonna ruin their lives with poor urban planning ideas. Then again the challenger trying so hard is only a symptom of how difficult it is to distinguish the two campaign platforms in the first place. 

If you're not a mercenary poor who thinks he's voting for his own subsidies or a rich kid turned young elite turned old egotist who's voting for a peer, I'd suggest you go fishing that day.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Elintarvikehuollossa lähdetään siitä, että energiasisällöltään normaali ravinnon saanti turvataan normaaliolojen vakavien häiriöiden ja poikkeusolojen varalta. Päätöksessä ei siten oleteta nykyisen ruokavalion säilymistä vaan riittävä energiatarpeen tyydyttäminen. Tämä perustuu kotimaisen alkutuotannon ja elintarviketeollisuuden jatkumiseen. Päätöksessä politiikkauhka on huomioitu, sillä päätöksen mukaan EU:n maatalouspolitiikkaan pyritään vaikuttamaan siten, että kotimaisella elintarviketeollisuudella on riittävä kotimainen raakaaineperusta. Elintarviketeollisuuden osalta esitetään toimintaedellytysten turvaamista ja kansainvälistymistä kilpailukyvyn säilymiseksi. 

&gt; Yleistavoitteena on maataloustuotteiden saatavuuden turvaaminen yhden heikon kotimaisen satokauden varalta. Käytännössä tämä tarkoittaa kotieläintuotantoa (maito, liha, kananmunat) sillä ruista, sokeria ja vihanneksia tuodaan jo nykyisellään. Toisaalta esimerkiksi satokautena 2012 korjuuoloista johtuen perunaa oletetaan tuotavan. Kasvipohjaista valkuaista (käytännössä soijaa) varmuusvarastoidaan määrä, jolla voidaan turvata kotieläintuotannon rehuhuollon sopeuttamista valkuaisen saantihäiriöiden varalta.

&gt; **Leipäviljaa pidetään varmuusvarastoissa eri puolilla maata teollisuuden vuoden tarpeisiin. Määrältään tämä vastaa noin 400 000 tonnia.** Käytännössä viljan varmuusvarastointia hallinnoi 1990 luvulla perustettu Huoltovarmuuskeskus, joka kilpailuttaa viljan varmuusvarastoinnin yksityisillä yrityksillä. Varmuusvarastot sisältävät elintarvikekäyttöön tarkoitettua vehnää ja ruista sekä suurimokäyttöön tarkoitettua kauraa ja ohraa. Siemenviljaa varastoidaan 80000 tonnia, josta sertifioitua siementä on 30 000 tonnia ja noin 50 000 tonnia lajikkeellista siemenviljaa. Siemenviljan varastoitu määrä vastaa noin 30 % viljan siemenhuollosta Suomessa. Myös kasvivalkuaista varastoidaan määrä, jolla voidaan turvata kotieläintuotannon rehuhuolto saantihäiriöiden varalta. Sertifioitua nurmikasvien siementä varmuusvarastoidaan noin 750 tonnia, joka on 20 – 30 % Suomessa tuotettavan nurmisiemenen määrästä. Rypsin siementä varastoidaan 180 tonnia, jonka avulla voidaan kattaa kolmasosa rypsin viljelyalasta. Lisäksi elintarvikehuoltovarmuuden varmistamiseksi turvataan sellaisten kasvilajien jalostus, joiden jalostustoiminta ei olisi Suomessa

The United States and European members of NATO never set the independence of Kosovo as an objective - if you read reports on the independence vote as it happened, you will see that it was a huge embarrassment and a serious diplomatic problem even for the champions of the 1999 intervention  that are the US, France or Germany. Several members of NATO and the EU still have not recognized the independence of Kosovo.

As stated elsewhere in this thread the independence of Kosovo is the result of a long process involving negotiation between parties, and constitutes a chapter of the inevitable breakdown of Yugoslavia into several states. The referendum on independence was only one option on the table, it was only implemented once all other options had been exhausted, and it was not the preferred option of the nations who intervened militarily in 1999.

A more fitting comparison would be North Cyprus vs. Crimea: both cases feature a military intervention by a neighbouring power under the pretext of defending an ethic minority; both targeted a country in a state of temporary weakness, and both ended with effective annexation under the guise of a referendum on self-determination (the Republic of North Cyprus is only recognized as a state by Turkey and is effectively administered by the Turkish government).

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"&gt;They were illegal when they illegally scaled Spanish borders without a valid visa. Anyway, the vast majority of asylum seekers in Europe are bogus. Being from a developing country is not grounds for asylum.

Then what they'll do is start destroying their documentation and claiming asylum when they're found out, just as they try to do in Australia. In which case, under Spanish law (thanks to them ratifying the UN refugee convention), they are not illegal, but are rather asylum seekers who have to be protected by the government until their claims are processed - which since they destroyed their documentation, is very expensive and difficult to do.

&gt;There are over 20 million EU citizens unemployed. These illegals are mostly unskilled and lack the relevant language skills. You will need to provide them with education, training, language support, housing, medical care and a modest welfare stipend for day to day essentials. Even then, few will find work.

Again, the economics just do no work out. Jailing them costs more than supporting them with welfare and language training.

&gt;They are illegal trespassers. If they destroy their documents, fine. We can get linguists to interview them and see where they come from. If that doesn't work, they can rot in jail until they cooperate. The word will quickly spread - it's not worth your while migrating illegally to the EU. Very rapidly.

How do you prove they came from there, and that they are who they said they are? How do you get the state they came from to accept them back? And are you going to send children that come with them to jail as well? Really? Or will you split up families, sending the children to orphanages, and the parents to jail?

&gt;If their countries wont take them back, then the EU should cut development aid to these places and apply stringent visa measures on their citizens. When the politicians in these countries find it difficult to visit Paris or London for a shopping trip, they will soon change their tune.

That's the point. You don't know where they came from, they destroyed their documentation and don't cooperate in the hope they can stay.

&gt;Lets cut to the brass tax. You don't believe in border controls. You probably don't believe in nation states or national sovereignty.

You can't justify intervention based on the *possibility* that genocide is happening. Genocide is a serious charge which requires proof beforehand. Otherwise it's either paranoid delusions or propaganda to support imperialist action.

Nor can you justify intervention because ""well, violence is happening in the vicinity, and we have nothing to do with it, but we must intervene to ensure the side we support wins.""

B) There is no 'rest of Ukraine' from the Ukrainian point of view. A country with Russian troops on its de jure territory won't ever be able to join NATO, nobody would risk that.

I think this policy of imposing sanctions on Russia is bound to fail. Putin literally couldn't care less. The only thing really hurting Russia's economy would be for Europe to stop buying Russian gas. But that hurts Europe way more than Russia, so this is no option.

For the first time in decades the West has something Russia wants, political recognition of Crimea's annexation. There is no way Russia will just undo it, so there is no gain in passive opposition. In my opinion, the reasonable approach is to get as much out of this as possible. While the West could just spend the next 50 years not recognizing the annexation, there will be no value in recognizing a long standing status quo, but now there is. The question should be: What does the West want from Russia? Few things come to mind: Russia to stop backing separatists in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Transnistria along with affirmation of non-intervention in Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Moldova for instance.

I don't think Russia will just give up on the option of further intervention in Ukraine for Crimea. This can only be achieved by mutually assuring non-intervention, which also means no NATO nor EU membership for Ukraine. But this is actually the right thing in my opinion. Ukraine is divided 50/50 into pro Russia and pro West, any one sided approach will piss off half the population. We have in fact just witnessed this leading to a revolution. The policies regarding Ukraine over the past decade of both, Russia and EU/NATO, have always been either Russia or EU/NATO, while it should actually be either both or none, as long as this domestic dispute isn't settled.

&gt; There were basically no muslims in Italy before the mass migration post-1980s.
&gt; 

Granted you were probably referring to modern times, but even there we should remember that in the 1960s there was already a substantial presence of Islam in Italy: [The Centro Culturale Islamico d'Italia (CCII) was founded in the 70s, the USMI (Unione degli Studenti Musulmani in Italia) in 1971](https://it-it.facebook.com/notes/molte-lodi/associazionismo-musulmano/10150212832277156), so by that time there must have already been a number of Muslims in Italy (even if only a verbal minority fighting for the recognition of their presence).

I see that you agree with me, but a comment like:

&gt; In Southern Italy it was only a temporary presence, never consolidated. On the other hand, in the island of Sicily the Muslim occupation lasted almost a century.
&gt; 

well, it can easily be misconstrued before looking at the facts that there was a Muslim domination lasting much more than a century, both if you are looking at a demographic presence and a political occupation.

From the Russian standpoint however, we must note that 18% of Russian gdp consist of exports to Europe, so saying that it will not hurt Russia is false - they will be bankrupt in a very short order should a blockade be realised - it would simply take too long to build enough pipelines to China. The corresponding number on the European side is 1% - it wouldn't be painless but it would not be catastrophe given enough short term measures to survive a lack of Russian gas.

As for your last point of divided population, that is what point C would accomplish - raising standards of infrastructure and living past the point where no one would want to return to the fold of Russia would take care of that. That should take care of any domestic disputes in Ukraine. That will not be cheap, but it will be needed.

 [**It's Scotland's oil**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's%20Scotland's%20oil): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;""__It's Scotland's oil__"" was a widely publicised political slogan used by the [Scottish National Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party) (SNP) during the 1970s in making their economic case for [Scottish independence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence). It was argued that the discovery of [North Sea oil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea_oil) off the coast of [Scotland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland), and the revenue that it created would not benefit Scotland to any significant degree while Scotland remained part of the [United Kingdom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom).

&gt;The SNP campaigned widely in both the [February 1974 UK General Election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_February_1974) and subsequent [October 1974 UK General Election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_October_1974) using this slogan. At the February election the SNP gained seven seats in the [House of Commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_House_of_Commons) and 22% of the Scottish vote, rising to eleven seats and 30% of the vote in the October election. The idea behind the slogan has proven to be controversial in discussions surrounding the financial viability of an independent Scottish state and still resonates to this day.

Either you have ID/pass from your ISP (1) or you put your router in a DMZ with the router provided by your ISP (2).

(1) : Free, SFR and Orange give you these information, BUT you will loose some services like VoIP and IPTV because they are on separate VLAN. You can get back IPTV with Orange and Free if your router supports VLAN and IPTV settings, for SFR I don't know. Beware that PPPoE has to be accelerated if you are on FTTH &gt; 100Mbps

(2) : Either your router's ISP has a bridge mode (SFR/Free) which puts automatically your router in a DMZ, either you have to put your router in a DMZ (Orange). This is convenient if you want to keep VoIP and IPTV easily, but can be a bottleneck with FFTH in terms of performance (like 0.1-0.5%).

To conclude : If your ISP's router has only 1Gbps WAN and 100Mbps LAN and you have 300Mbps FTTH WAN, you might want to bypass your ISP's router.

As for what is better, an American masters or German one, that is a hard question. The good news is they like both. Let's look at both options:

American Masters:  German firms like them for the same reason they would like an American Bachelor degree or just hiring an American, that is it makes their company/devision/development team more international and it is usually seen as cool to have be able to attract top foreign talent. Also it is always a nice benefit to the group that someone knows English as a native language. However, assuming you are already an American with an American Bachelors, maybe the masters doesn't add much to this point. 

German Masters: German firms will like this because they are familiar with them. And it helps with contacts. For instance, many people write their thesis (usually during the 6 month period before graduate) at an organization that their Uni referred them to, and then they could potentially get a job offer there afterwards or at least have a bit of work-like experience. In my case, even though I work in a different city than where I studied, my boss knows my old professors. So it helped me in the job application process that they had hired people from my masters program before and it worked well for them. However, remember  this is probably true all over the world and if you decide to return to the US after studying, instead of good contacts you will have HR looking at your resume thinking ""??what is this strange foreign school??"" 

Although that is a tough decision, again the good news is that both are awesome. ",0,1395242688,null,0,false,0,cg6j94u,t3_20p4ss,t1_cg6j94u,t1_cg5zxq6,null,1432975561,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt;Where does the capital come from for these startups?

I would say this is where the State should be stepping in. For relatively small investments (compared to social programs) they can support startups. People love to make fun of Texas, but it has a half a billion dollar fund set aside for tech startups. Partially because of state support, Austin is known as the ""Silicon Valley of the South."" When Sony wanted to develop a new PS3 graphics processor, it didn't do it in its native Japan or Silicon Valley, but Texas. Texas now produces more tech hardware than California.

New York City recently set up a half a billion dollar fund for biotech and urban research startups. This is available to students who graduate from one of their two new tech campuses. These two campuses are collaborations between US, European, Canadian, Japanese, Australian and Israeli universities. Because scientists often dont start companies, 20% of the required courses at these campuses are related to entrepreneurship. They dont want to just churn out more researchers that go work for multinational pharmaceutical companies, they want to churn out biotech entrepreneurs and help them succeed.

An aging city in upstate New York asked why so many research scientists went to work for multinationals instead of starting their own companies and most brought up how expensive labs were. So this city spent several million dollars building labs that are free for scientists to use for X amount of years as long as they form their start-up in that city. Still a relatively small investment considering the potential upsides.

The US Federal Government is promoting ""research institutes"". A high tech digital manufacturing center was recently announced for Chicago, a space age materials research and manufacturing center was announced for Detroit. These are two of 45 planned institutes nationwide.

Thailand (IIRC) invested heavily in stem cell research centers, causing what some might call a reverse brain drain. 

Silicon Valley has a very robust venture capital network. Many other cities look at it in envy. But government programs have proven successful counterweights to the Valley's venture capital system. It is a matter of having politicians set aside a little money now to plant a seed that will grow into something that will benefit people far longer than their political cycle. That is the difficult part. When a guy in charge of the tech campus project in New York was told he would not know how successful the program was for 30 years, well after hes retired, he said (from memory), ""I know, but its what's good for New York"". 

**TL;DR: There are plenty of things local (or national) governments can do to support startups. Unfortunately these programs still seem to be the exception rather than the norm. If a venture capital network doesn't exist, governments can invest a little now, for what will likely be a larger payoff later.**",0,1395245022,null,0,false,0,cg6kboj,t3_20qrg5,t1_cg6kboj,t1_cg6di2j,null,1432976066,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The rent index for Gießen is at 10€/m² for apartments up to 30m² and 8€/m² for apartments up to 80m². (http://www.wohnungsboerse.net/mietspiegel-Giessen/3270 and http://www.immowelt.de/immobilienpreise/landkreis-giessen/mietspiegel) 

A single bedroom apartment with kitchen and bathroom is in the range from 400 to 500€/month plus utilities (ca. 150€/month).

A decent internet connection  costs about 25 to 35€/month.
I recommend internet via cable. Buy the ""2play plus 100"" plan from Unitymedia which gives you 100mbit/2.5mbit internet connection and a flat rate telephone connection for 25€ the first 12 months and then 35€ after that. (http://www.unitymedia.de/privatkunden/kombipakete/2play-kombipakete/)

DSL from Telekom, Vodafone or others is slower and costs more.

I estimate mobile smartphone plan at around 40€/month but this is not my field of expertise (hey, I don't even own a smartphone myself ;))

Adding 150€/month for food (a bit on the high side, I know) and another 100€/month for misc. costs you are at about 975€/month.

With 1600€/month income I don't see any problems financially. Even if the apartment costs a bit more than anticipated.

With this income you could even finance a small new car without problems.

EU had no interest in overthrowing the government in Ukraine. Russia just wanted to preserve her assets in Crimea. And US had been pulling these stunts ever since Obama took office.

Crimea has two of those, although they don't have a separate army. You can also say that the dissolution between Norway and Sweden happened peacefully, but there were forces in the Swedish government that wanted to keep the Union by force, and Norway had spent the previous couple of decades strengthening the military and building forts along the Swedish border. 

Also, I have to point out that it wasn't ""just"" a shared foreign policy. Just a few years earlier the king, the Swedish king, had been free to appoint the Norwegian prime minister and government as he saw fit, and he could veto any changes to the constitution, effectively dictating Norwegian policy. The fact that that wasn't the case by 1905 is only because the Norwegian parliament fought to remove it.

Es ist nicht immer alles gelungen, was Jan Böhmermann macht, aber sein Team bei der Bildundtonfabrik ist wirklich fantastisch. Unverbrauchte Köpfe! Die sind so unglaublich kreativ, da können die Schreiberlinge bei HalliGalli und TV total, etc. sich eine Scheibe abschneiden. Die fahren alle überhaupt kein Risiko mehr leider. 

Die neue Staffel von HalliGalli ist ein gutes Beispiel. Die Aktionen wiederholen sich nur noch, es gibt meist überhaupt keine zweite Ebene mehr (vielleicht auch weil dann das sehr heterogene Publikum abspringen könnte).

Die Bild- und Tonsprache beim Neo Magazin ist ausgezeichnet und wer die Sendung seit Herbst 2013 verfolgt, konnte im Wochenrhythmus die Verbesserungen feststellen.

Das Hauptproblem beim Neo Magazin ist, dass man einfach zur Zielgruppe gehören muss, um sich angesprochen zu fühlen. Ich kann vollkommen nachvollziehen, warum manche es einfach nicht mögen. HalliGalli findet da eher einen kleinsten gemeinsamen Nenner, daher sind die auch im Hauptprogramm. Haben dadurch aber natürlich auch viel mehr Druck mittlerweile, was man in der Produktion merkt.
Für den Grimme-Preis ist das aber alles irrelefant.

&gt; ... weist Böhmermann der digitalen Generation den Weg ins Zweite Deutsche Internet – und einer kleinen, aber feinen Minderheit auch ins lineare ZDFneo.

Darüber hinaus wird das Neo Magazin nicht kommen. Jan Böhmermann wird zwar wichtiger werden und wenn er die richtigen Leute hinter sich scharrt weiterhin einigen Erfolg einfahren - vor allem jetzt mit dem Grimmepreis.

Interviews können leider beide Sendungen nicht, aber Böhmermann hat meist den Vorteil, dass er die besseren Gäste hat, die nicht nur Promotion machen müssen.

true,Seefor,DENK,Copenhagen,"It's actually really interesting when you visit /r/russia as well. There's a certain paranoia to the general mentality of Russia being under siege. It seems that they think that we in the West are sceptical of the Russian government and its maneuvring on the international stage because we are just inherently anti-Russian. 

They don't seem to make the connection that it is not the people that we have a problem with, but the undemocratic gangster regime at power, which is mimicking a fascist regime more and more by the day. If Russia had a normal and functioning democracy there would not have to be any problems at all in our relations with Russia, and there wouldn't be conflicting interests in Ukraine etc., because our interests in developing a democratic market economy would be the same. The only reason there is a conflict now is that Putin knows that more functioning democracies in his neighbourhood will put pressure on his own regime, as Russians perhaps will demand more democracy themselves. And Putin is masterly managing to appeal to the nationalist feelings in Russia to push his own policies, which are designed to preserve his own kleptocratic regime.

When you read the discussion on /r/russia and what the pro-Putin people there say, it seems that they think that the West and NATO are hell bent on the actual destruction of Russia, just because it is Russia, without considering if it might have something to do with the nature of Russian government at the moment.

It's also worrying that Russians, who are just a bit national minded, seem to automatically throw their support behind the autocratic Putin regime. It's as if what Russia is conflates with Putin, which is why they see our criticism of Putin as a criticism of their country and nationality, making them extremely defensive.

It's a highly unfortunate situation, and it really did not have to be like this. One can only hope that the Russian people will wake up at sometime, perhaps with a Maidan of their own, and that Russia turns completely democratic, so we can finally put the cold war behind us. Unfortunately at the moment the Russians seem more concerned with restoring their national pride (in their own eyes, they are sullying their reputation in the eyes of the world) than free press, free elections and limiting corruption.

And it's really a tragedy, because a strong, rich, democratic and friendly Russia is in everyone's best interest. It would be a phenomenal trading partner and the world would be a lot safer.

As the roads that also can serve as airfields in the case of war. It's quite obvious when you drive down a road and it suddenly gets insanely wide and paved in the middle of nowhere :) [Here's](http://www.paramotor.fi/!cid_002201c671c2$e5ae7e50$6500a8c0@koti.jpg) a picture taken from the air of one of them. As you can see it is a small two lane forest road that suddenly gets wide as hell. All highways have sections that are straight and specially reinforced that will allow fighters to take off and land from them. These sections aren't obvious as they still keep the same width as the rest of the highway, they're just straighter sections and if you know what to look for you'll notice.

All important bridges and sections of infrastructure have sections in them made so that they can easily be filled with explosives and destroyed as to hinder the movements of the enemy.

In major cities, especially Helsinki, there are tunnel networks connecting different strategic locations allowing troop movements effectively. The defence force also has weapon stashes stacked around the country and every bigger building or area has to by law have a ""bunker"" built for the civilians to take cover in. These are marked with [this sign](http://www.maatilanturvallisuus.fi/images/images/1802_0604_62f.jpg) and in case of an emergency or areal alarm you should seek the closes one of these. They are heavily reinforced parts of buildings with steel doors that even help to seal out gas from chemical weapons. The law states that every building or group of buildings exceeding 1 200 m2 has to have one.

Subway stations in Helsinki are, if I remember correctly, also designed to work as shelter or command posts for the armed forces.

So the US was thinking that by bombing Serbia they will become friends or what exactly do you mean?

&gt;Kosovo has a pretty good geopolitical location, so the US built their biggest army base outside of US soil there (Bondsteel), which could never happen under Serbian government back then.

The US has many army bases outside of US, like in Germany, Japan, France etc. They could've easily build one in Albania, which is quite near Kosovo and loyal to the US, so what you're saying can't really be listed as a reason for why the US decided to help Kosovo.



&gt; Kosovo has lots of resources, it's rich in coal, gold, and other minerals, it's also rumored that there are big reserves of groundwater.

So what if Kosovo does? The resources are and will be under the administration of Kosovan authority.

&gt; Just few of the reasons from the top of my head, i'm sure there are more.

Maybe, just maybe, the US and NATO did why the did because they all agreed it was the right thing to do, and not because of some ulterior motives.

Russia does not exactly enjoyed fall of the Soviet Union, (open wiki and read up about stuff like shock therapy, life expectancy, drugs, alcohol consumption) so the time when Russians think that ""historical injustice/unfairness"" was fixed as in Crimea, they felt proud. 


Now, this is a bit of a stretch, but after the fall of the Soviet Union Russia probably felt (and to a certain extent was) treated like Weimar Republic and Russians never forget, so there's that. 


But most of this stuff is bitterness and if i would take a guess, closest thing would be British Empire loosing its empire status something like this :

http://countryballs.net/news/nobody_can_stop_the_great_british_empire/2014-03-11-233


However, it does not change the fact that due to Russia constantly feel being threatened or treated unjustly (lies about no fly zones, NATO creeping toward eastern borders, missile defend shields, whole ordeal with ukraine, colorful revolutions and others) and a serious lack of desire to improve things domestically (think Soviet Union minus social aspect of it due to corruption, oligarchs, poor management ) the possibility of other ""incidents"" is there. 


Possible nearest places are South-Eastern Ukraine and Transnistria region of moldova (but this is already widely covered in the media, so nothing new here).


A lot of things would depend on how EU/Russia/U.S relations would develop, if West will keep on pushing into Russian sphere of interest, Russia will probably change the way it acts on international stage and be far less cooperative or understanding.

true,optymizer,MOLD,Moldova,"I'll summarize what the core issue is, to the best of my ability, even though I'm bound to step on people's toes here:

[Moldova has 75% Moldovans and 25% minorities (Russians - 6%, Ukrainians - 8.5%, Bulgarians, etc).](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Moldova)

Culturally, the Moldovans are split between those who adopted the Romanian culture, those who rejected it and went with Russian instead, and those who adopted both Russian and Romanian (I'm including language and traditions as part of 'culture'). This led to a weak identity for the Moldovans, while the minorities have a strong identity (i.e. ""I'm a Russian living in Moldova"", not ""I'm a Moldovan of Russian descent""). Obviously Russia is interested in keeping this divide alive and well.

The weak Moldovan identity is what makes it difficult for the overwhelming majority to win over a very vocal minority. I don't have exact numbers on how many Moldovans adopted/preserved what culture, so let's assume that when thinking about their identity, 40% Moldovans support joining Romania, 40% Moldovans support an independent Moldova and 20% Moldovans support joining Russia (this is from my own experience - I know fewer Moldovans who'd support joining Russia, than the other 2 options).

If you hold a referendum about joining Romania, you will only get positive votes from 40% of 75% Moldovans, i.e. only 30% of the total population of Moldova.

If you advertise joining the EU, you can tell some people that it's *essentially* the same as joining Romania (no visas, no painful borders) and other people that you'll still preserve your independence within the EU (just like Germany, Romania, Bulgaria, etc). The result is that you'll get 80% of the 75% Moldovans to say 'yes', so 60% of the total population. 

But don't forget that there are minorities who'd love to join the EU. Let's say 33% of the 25% of minorities, that's another 8% of the population that you can add to the 60% you already have, for a grand total of ~70% of Moldova. 

So that's why the ""join EU"" message is stronger than the ""join Romania"" message.


I think this maps well into what happened in the recent years. This identity problem gave rise to a number of parties with various agendas back in the 90s, tailoring their message to their specific audience, effectively splitting an already divided population into more groups. While these parties were arguing, the Communist party seized power in the 2000s. After the civil unrest in 2009, it was clear we're not just going to join Romania easily (since Romania was already in the EU) and we've already failed at that during the 90s, so someone did the same math I did above and decided it might work. It barely worked, but they got the power back and did work towards integrating into the EU (I think they could have got more minorities if they didn't advertise the ""reunite with Romania"" as much -  those Moldovans were already sold on the idea), not without the usual political scandals.

So that's why the Government is focused on joining the EU, instead of joining Romania.

I am that harsh only occasionally. But it's a slippery slope - give them a finger and they start to take an entire hand. The West is already more powerful politically and economically than Poland. Why would I want Westerners to settle down here, with unemployment in 20% range, national debt being even greater than in communist times or with 2 million of Poles (including 600K children) living below the poverty line?

You probably will say that EU allowed Poles to migrate and lower that rate, but then again, we are losing our best and brightest, the enterprising ones, the university graduates, skilled craftsmen. Sure, eventually they could be replaced with foreigners such as yourself, but that actually means that the middle class - the foundation of capitalist society - will be significantly westernized.

In a way it all makes sense, because Eastern front was not all tea and bagles, but a campaign for extermination not even remotely similar to anything Western front ever saw. What Soviet Union faced was *almost* a completely United Europe, who came not to conquer, but to end the existence of Slavs and get lebensraum for itself.
 

This is actually perfectly falls in line with every empire ever, since all they care about is - markets and resources. Think about it for a bit, India did not invaded Britain; Chinese were conquered by small Japan;Native Americans ordeal; Dutch colonies; Spanish Empire; all of them shared the same pattern  -&gt; a leader of its time looks to expand it influence and get those 2 **key** things. In that way modern Russia do not see itself as a threat to Europe, precisely because there is nothing of interest there, but Russia on the other hand is like the biggest prize ever. 


But back to WW2 and SU, after the victory Churchill proposed a plan to redraw maps of Europe and establish spheres on influence. Stalin agreed and this is why when there were communist uprising in Greece, he did nothing and when there were uprisings in Czechoslovakia and other places, West mostly remained silent. Because of Cold War split and a somewhat competing ideologies it was essential to keep those buffer states between mainland USSR and Western world, we fought via proxies mainly.
 

People often look at things from the perspective of a modern, liberal, civilized man, but back then things like Empires still existed, concentration camps or deportation were a **normal practice**, oppression of minorities bloomed with all colors of rainbow. History is a crazy thing and if u want to understand Russians a bit more, i highly suggest reading some books from Russia right after revolution and what followed it, to USSR, Eastern front and end of WW2 and what followed it. 


But back to modern times, Estonians might felt threatened or scared, but truth is Russia is not really interested in them; it is widely accepted by population that Baltics, Poles, Finns are a lost cause and should be left alone (unless they start to shit on our history or try to shake balance of regional power with things like Anti missile shields etc). Baltics or Poles for example get reminded that big part of their trade is with Russia, only when they are being assholes, with stuff like border restrictions, swine plague bans and so on. Finns are mostly quiet, so almost no troubles with them. Ukraine also falls under this category, they are a weird bunch and when they start shitting on everything Russian and treat folks like Bandera a hero, Gas prises rise and trade barriers are implemented, when they are chill - no problems.

 
In a mind of a Russian - we almost never start any kind of shit or a mess, we just react to it and defend our interests. Crimea in that sense is a bit weird and something i would call an ""overstep of boundaries"", but from geopolitical point (historical justice for some) of view its probably the correct move, since Ukraine was already lost for at least 1 presidential cycle. 


Euromaidan initially started as a protest to Eurasian Union stuff, during its 3 months Russia was portrayed heavily negative in Ukrainian media, so in a sense people were brainwashed and pro-Russian candidate could not win, then shootings happen and the probability of it went to even lower number and lastly EU/U.S brokered deal went out the window as well. So, no matter who Russia would get as a candidate, he had zero chance of victory, which i guess ""upset"" Kremlin to say the least. 

Thus events of kicking the guy on the ground started with a potential to continue in South-Eastern Ukraine. To be honest, after reading both UkrNet and RuNet i don't think we see each other as a brothers or even a friends anymore. The amount of hatred is overwhelming, everyone is an ""armchair warrior"" and while Russians are mostly trolling or making fun of them (as usually is, when you feel powerful), Ukrainians is more up in arms and wanting to fight (which i guess is fair, since we took Crimea, but they kind a were not too fond of us even before). 

Overall, i expressed my concerns on reddit a couple months ago, that one of the worst things i fear could happen - would be Slav on Slav action. Back then it was elusive and highly unlikely, today i am not so optimistic anymore.

&gt; Il servizio permette di trasportare su rotaia sia autocarri completi che soli semirimorchi e si
differenzia da altri servizi simili per il fatto che ogni carro viene caricato singolarmente, il che
permette il trasporto di semirimorchi non accompagnati. In passato, il servizio poteva essere
offerto soltanto a determinati tipi di semirimorchi, in particolare quelli a cisterna, viste le
limitazioni imposte dal profilo del traforo del Fréjus. Con il completamento dei lavori per
l’allargamento del profilo del traforo, il potenziale di trasporto di AFA è raddoppiato e il gestore
intende portare il numero di veicoli da 25 000 nel 2010 a 50 000 nel 2012 e a 100 000 entro il
2015, istituendo anche nuove tratte che arriveranno fino alla regione di Parigi. Tuttavia,
nell’attuale contesto di crisi economica, questi piani sono stati temporaneamente accantonati.

&gt; Tuttavia, nei primi 6 mesi dopo il rilancio del servizio per il profilo di carico più largo GB1, i
semirimorchi che richiedono questo profilo costituivano già il 25% di tutte le unità trasportate. Nel
luglio 2013 il traffico GB1 rappresentava già il 39% di tutti i rimorchi trasportati.",0,1395258712,null,0,false,0,cg6r1w2,t3_20qmvg,t1_cg6r1w2,t1_cg6fiqa,null,1432979244,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

You are, people love a villain and russian autoritarianism makes for a perfect bullseye for social justice worriors.

&gt;the undemocratic gangster regime at power, which is mimicking a fascist regime more and more by the day

I think russians are a better judge of how fascist their government is considering they don't get all their information via the news. In any case you are using a 21 century judgement for mid 20th century society.

&gt;because our interests in developing a democratic market economy would be the same.

so if nobody has a diferent ideology than you, you wouldn't have to fight anyone? yeah I think the russians feel the same way.

&gt;what the pro-Putin people there say, it seems that they think that the West and NATO are hell bent on the actual destruction of Russia, just because it is Russia, without considering if it might have something to do with the nature of Russian government at the moment.

my feelings exactly when I see only anti russian rethortic on /r/europe no shades of grey whatsoever, no political empathy, only Putin = devil 

&gt;It's also worrying that Russians, who are just a bit national minded, seem to automatically throw their support behind the autocratic Putin regime. It's as if what Russia is conflates with Putin, which is why they see our criticism of Putin as a criticism of their country and nationality, making them extremely defensive.

what is the world coming to when good old fashion nationalist beliefs clouds peoples judgement

&gt;that Russia turns completely democratic

they will, when the cultural and economical conditions will be right worring about it won't move the process any faster

&gt;so we can finally put the cold war behind us

....anc concentrate on the war on terrorism and extremism....the media, the internet people in general need a bogey man, you need to point the finger at something that is clearly bad so you feel like you're ""on the right side of history"", it is basic tribalism at a world stage

&gt;the Russians seem more concerned with restoring their national pride (in their own eyes, they are sullying their reputation in the eyes of the world) than free press, free elections and limiting corruption.

...any contry that has a significant part of the electorate over 50 prioritises national pride and stability over freedom and uncertainty, judgement is less harsh when dealing with wealthy country.

&gt;because a strong, rich, democratic and friendly Russia is in everyone's best interest.

except the americans

&gt;the world would be a lot safer

my fear is geared more toward a uncontested US or china than a grumpy old Russia, ideology changes in less than a generation, economical systems rarely do, the US needs it's military to feed it's economy, they need enemies to survive, the day they can't find any, will be the day they become the enemy.",1,1395259297,null,0,false,0,cg6rd6b,t3_20su98,t1_cg6rd6b,t1_cg6md10,null,1432979392,-3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-3

- When will the change negotiations Crimean Constitution , bringing it into line with the Russian Constitution ?

Lawyers are already working on a new draft constitution. This document will be a series of revolutionary things related to languages ​​, for example. State languages ​​in the Crimea will be considered Russian and Crimean Tatar . Now there is a discussion about the Ukrainian language. In the framework of the constitution will be spelled out as a special rule with respect to the Crimean Tatars.

- Several years ago there was a problem acutely land seizures by the Crimean Tatars . Will address the issue of ownership of the land ? Will , a register of land in the factual and legal possession of the Crimean Tatars ?

Speaking of the Crimean Tatars , I want to note that we understand treat their vigilance associated with the introduction of the Crimea in the Russian Federation. The fact that the long-suffering people experienced very serious deportation of 1944, when tens of thousands of Crimean Tatars were forcibly evacuated to the Urals , Central Asia . According to them, about half of the Crimean Tatars deportation died. In this regard, many Crimean Tatars , especially in the elderly , there is a problem with the perception of Russia . Some believe Russian prison of nations . We are gradually beginning to discover for the Crimean Tatars new Russia , which is a multinational state , which supports regardless of faith, regardless of tradition , culture all peoples living on its territory. A striking example - there Tatarstan, Ingushetia, Chechnya - the regions where Muslims live . The same will also apply to the Crimean Tatars.

As for your question , do we want with the Crimean Tatars to legalize all land on a contractual basis . Part of the land , we were asked to vacate because these lands are needed for social needs. For example, near the bypass ( road - approx. Ed.) Of Simferopol , where a lot of squatting , the land needed for the development of infrastructure of the city . But we are ready to legalize and many other land for the normal life of the Crimean Tatars.

- You said that the Crimean Tatars allocated space in the leadership and government agencies. Do you already have appointments among them for these positions ?

Just yesterday , we held talks with the leaders of Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people , inside which there is a very serious debate : is pro-Russian supporters , there was a pro-Ukrainian , there are centrists . I think in the next few days at a meeting of the Supreme Council of Crimea will appointment as Vice - Speaker of the Parliament and the deputy prime minister.

Discusses what Il'yasov Ilmi , Member kurultay Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people , will become vice -speaker and deputy prime minister discussed the candidacy Zaur Smirnov , deputy chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people .

Potentially, but even the modern Russian rpg or German Panzerfaust 3 needs to be in close proximity and even then under right angles. Leopard are up-armored beasts with protective angles and strong composite armor. 

You'd need the newest ATGM (Anti Tank Guided Missile) typically to more effectively fight tanks, now guess what? You've probably given away your position to the tank or another vehicles FLIR and other optic capabilities.

The CV90 purchase by the Dutch MOD was never intended to replace the Leopards, The CV90 is an IFV (infantry fighting vehicle) a Tank can attack other tanks far better. 

Imagine large-scale offensive or an open field battle, and you'd be better off with an army of Leopards firing from larger distances than the enemy can even see or fire at you.

In such situations, it's almost certain that there are foreign agents everywhere. The CIA and FSB are trying to move the events towards their own goals. 

I wouldn't be suprised if the FSB has agent provocateurs inside the organizations spewing hate towards the Russian minorities (in order to justify Russia's military intervention), just as I wouldn't be surprised if the CIA provided logistic support to the opposition regarding the snipers (in order to justify the forceful ousting of Yanukovich).
