true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"&gt; Du vermischst verschiedene Aspekte. Es geht hier nicht um Kinder, sondern wir reden über erwachsene Menschen. 

Nein. Erwachsene Menschen haben üblicherweise Kinder. Kinder erkranken üblicherweise.

Und Eso-fuzzis heilen ihre Kinder üblicherweise wie sie sich selber ""heilen"" würden.

&gt;wende das auch auf andere Fragestellungen an, wo es um das Recht auf Selbstschädigung geht, z.B. beim Reddit-Dauerbrenner, der Legalisierung von Drogen.

So wie Ich das mitbekomme ist die Argumentation meistens eine sehr praktische und versucht sogar zu argumentieren, dass das Gesamtschädigungsmaß bei Legalisierung (bzw Decriminalization, wie ich das bevorzugt nenne) niedriger ist. Du solltest der Debatte besser folgen, bevor du hier imho unpassende Analogien ziehst. Schau dir mal die portugiesische Drogenpolitik an.

&gt;Das geht natürlich nicht immer und dann kommt es auf die Frage an: was ist wichtiger? Persönliche Freiheit, auch wenn es dazu führt, daß der eine oder andere Mensch ""falsche"" Entscheidungen trifft, die unter Umständen auch zum Tod führen können oder eben die Volksgesundheit, auch wenn es auf Kosten der persönlichen Freiheit geht.

Der entscheidende Punkt ist übrigens ein Anderer, und dieser Punkt unterscheidet ncohmal das Drogenproblem vom Homoheilerproblem:

Bei Drogen weißt prinzipiell **jeder Mensch** woran er ist. Er nimmt seine Schädigung also **wissentlich** in Kauf.

Aber weiß er es bei Homoöpathie? Oder Schwulenheilern? Beides sind Dinge, die von entsprechenden Lobbies propagandistisch verteidigt werden und Homoöpathie noch dazu etwas, was sich durch Mund-zu-Mund-Propaganda durch case-reports als wirksam darstellt.

Man geht also von einer **Heilung** - nicht einer **Schädigung** aus. Das ist ein fundamentaler Unterschied! Hast du das bedacht?

Es wird also vorgespiegelt, dass eine bezahlte Dienstleistung zur Heilung führt, ohne wissenschaftliche Abstützung -sogar gegen den Stand der Wissenschaft.

Wie schon vorher angemerkt, ich sehe da Betrug. Der muss nichtmal durch ein esoterisches/religiöses eigenes Weltbild motiviert sein, sondern auch durch... Geld.

Es muss vor Desinformation geschützt werden, v.a. bei wissenschaftlichen, d.h. medizinischen Themen. Es gibt auch Schadensersatz wenn du dir ne Freie Energie maschine kaufst, die nicht funktioniert.

&gt; But you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the whole bourgeoisie in chorus.

&gt; He has not even a suspicion that the real point is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production.

&gt; For the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women which, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established by the Communists. The Communists have no need to introduce community of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial.

&gt; Our bourgeois, not content with having the wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other's wives.

&gt; Bourgeois marriage is in reality a system of wives in common and thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly be reproached with, is that they desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalised community of women.

You did not say that German people on this subreddit are arrogant, you were talking about Germany as a whole, you didn't mean that any display of celebration was arrogant? Oh okay, so you meant that everything else they do is in an arrogant fashion, except their celebration, got it! You are so full of shit.

""people who think they are politically correct start bringing up the nazis and piss themselves out of jealousy""

You clearly said: ""You know what makes me sad? Germans like you are sad when people compare you with the nazis (which is wrong, I agree)""

Note the ""whish is wrong, I agree"", still incredibly ridiculous that you go out of your way to say that it makes YOU sad when German people are saddened by constantly being reminded by something in their countries history - which they had no part in whatsoever. It is pathetic.

""You will not even do me the courtesy of replying to my actual argument? I showed you specific phrasing that demonstrated an extreme arrogance and a mindset of domination vs submission. Please, for the love of all that you hold holy, don't just brush off my argument.""

You have no argument, you are literally saying: LOOK AT THIS GUY, ALL OF GERMANY IS STUPID AND ARROGANT! Seriously, look at yourself, you are saying that because of this one person, or many - as you claim, these people are arrogant, and I even disagree in this one case that you bring up, I do not think that /u/Stirnlappenbasilisk is arrogant. There is nothing to brush off when you bring nothing to the table but hatred.

""Which accusation exactly is wrong? Do you want me to cite Germans being arrogant in this sub?""

This is what is wrong with you, ""Do you want me to cite Germans being arrogant?"". Germany has a population of 81 million people, there are by percent at least as many arrogant people in your secret country of birth as there are in Germany, of course you can find arrogant people anywhere where there are people, because - SURPRISE: some people are arrogant, and saying all of Germans or most are arrogant, is just ignorant and racist.

""Telling someone that it's annoying how arrogant they are is rude? Really? Why don't you also downvote the other person who lashed out at me with his ""I'm not going to be your bitch""? That is, I suppose, perfectly civil?""

You are being very rude when you accuse a whole country of being rude because of what YOU have seen on an internet forum, it is very close minded and does not belong in 2014.

""What a fucking ad hominem. You should be ashamed to even bring this up as an argument.""

It was a small note at the end, how is it such a secret, you have no problem with attacking somebody else because of WHERE THEY ARE FROM, but when asked where you are from, I should be ashamed. You are a joke.

The myth that US students are under-educated is pretty popular in Germany. My guess is that it arises from things like

- There are schools that do not teach evolution and the US is an exceptionally nonsecular society. People often associate this with low levels of education (which admittedly holds for most countries).

- No hierarchical school system. Our school system here in Germany is very elitist. When 10 years old, children are split up by their potential (the elementary teachers write a recommendation which is critical for the application to one of 3-5 secondary education levels). Even though there is absolutely no evidence that this is good, people still believe in the system and fight against a major reform.

- When in secondary education, people learn a lot about the European political systems and values. The influence of French, British and German philosophers, artists, writers and scientists in the world is being discussed. Due to the short history of America and that it's leading scientific role is in areas that lower education cannot reach, it appears like Europe is still the scientific center of the world.

Wenn ein Medikament oder eine Medizinische Dienstleistung als funktionstüchtig beworben wird und wisenschaftlich festgestellt ist, dass keinerlei Medikamentenspezifische Wirkung besteht oder im Zweifelsfall sogar Schaden, ist das eine Täuschungshandlung, bei Homöopathie zb insbesondere da anzunehmen ist, dass der behandelnde Arzt über entsprechendes Wissen in seinem Fachgebiet verfügt.

Oh okay, so you meant that everything else they do is in an arrogant fashion, except their celebration, got it! You are so full of shit.

I only said that a lot of Germans are arrogant and pretend they are superior in everything. It has nothing to do with celebrating or not celebrating. What the hell are you even talking about? I never talked about Germany as a whole and even went ahead and clarified what I meant in my second comment. 

&gt; Note the ""whish is wrong, I agree"", still incredibly ridiculous that you go out of your way to say that it makes YOU sad when German people are saddened by constantly being reminded by something in their countries history - which they had no part in whatsoever. It is pathetic.

That's quote sniping. I'm not made sad by Germans who are sad. I'm made sad from the hypocricy of them being sad on one hand and then being arrogant and pretending to be superior on the other. Why would I be sad if someone was only sad? You are making an effort to misunderstand what I'm saying. 

&gt; You have no argument, you are literally saying: LOOK AT THIS GUY, ALL OF GERMANY IS STUPID AND ARROGANT! Seriously, look at yourself, you are saying that because of this one person, or many - as you claim, these people are arrogant, and I even disagree in this one case that you bring up, I do not think that /u/Stirnlappenbasilisk [-2] is arrogant. There is nothing to brush off when you bring nothing to the table but hatred.

Your argument does not even make sense grammatically. I'm not saying that ""all of Germany is stupid and arrogant"". I'm only saying that there's too much arrogance coming from Germans. How is that hateful? It's just an observation. 

&gt; his is what is wrong with you, ""Do you want me to cite Germans being arrogant?"". Germany has a population of 81 million people, there are by percent at least as many arrogant people in your secret country of birth as there are in Germany, of course you can find arrogant people anywhere where there are people, because - SURPRISE: some people are arrogant, and saying all of Germans or most are arrogant, is just ignorant and racist.

Racist? Really? So, it's impossible that some negative characteristic is part of a culture? If I see arrogant comments and on average more of them have a tiny German flag next to their name than any other country, then I'm going to draw conclusions. I don't pretend I understand why exactly it happens but if it happens I'm not going to not say anything. 

&gt; You are being very rude when you accuse a whole country of being rude because of what YOU have seen on an internet forum, it is very close minded and does not belong in 2014.

But I never accused the whole country. I apologise if that was what you understood. I only said that there's too much arrogance coming from Germans in this sub. 

&gt; Did you read the article?

You are correct that my comment wasn't very relevant to the article submitted. I was only replying to that guy. 

&gt; I am trying to end it on a good note, if you are going to go ahead and cry because of a slight amount of backlash after you attack a whole country with your ignorance then so be it, I am not your mother for fucks sake, grow up.

I didn't attack a fucking whole country. For the love of all that is holy, stop accusing me of something I didn't do. Did I ever say ""All Germans are arrogant""? I didn't. 

Instead of writing a wall of text just to put me down and and tell me off, at least try to give me the benefit of the doubt. If you're not willing to even do that, why do you even bother to reply?

Des patrons, il y en a de toutes sortes. Des bourgeois, aussi.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; As someone who is involved in business (though my business is selling legal services..) I can never understand why people would want to limit their customer base.

Often you want, but outright refusing service is stupid. It is easy to form it so that unwanted people will not feel good there on their own and don't want to shop there. For example naming a bar Gallipoli or Dieppe would be a strong suggestion that British customers are not quite wanted there :-) 

Usually, the rational reason is that you want rich customers who may be repulsed by poor customers: hence dress codes in clubs. Or you want people to pay a premium for the feeling that this product is reservd for an exclusive group, hence the expensive brands who don't carry large sizes for obese people, sending the message that if you wear this, you are pretty.

This is a bit funny, basically selling customers _other customers_ i.e. telling people ""you are as cool as them"" but it works.

The worst example was when I was a young idiot and paid money for a course that would teach me how to do an insurance agent job, the kind when you have to sell to your friends. It is stupid anyhow, but the ingenious part was that they required us to wear full suits and ties for the training course.

C'est ZE question. Impossible d'être sûr. /r/shitredditsays, le premier sub du groupe, a clairement un rôle de défouloir trollesque, pas trop sérieux. Il y a une vingtaine de subs affiliés à SRS, par contre. /r/SRSMen, /r/SRSWomen, /r/SRSDiscussion sont les plus sérieux, et ils ont des opinions radicales.

&gt; C'est ultra-féministe c'est ça?

SRS et les autres groupes affiliés tiennent de l'idéologie SJ (Social Justice), appelée par ses détracteurs SJW (Social Justice Warrior). C'est... compliqué à expliquer, mais je vais essayer d'en faire un exposé rapide.

Pour comprendre l'idéologie SJW, il faut comprendre le concept du privilège, un concept originant des mouvements radicaux-féministes des années 70. Les hommes sont mieux traités dans la société que les femmes, yep? Les blancs que les noirs, les valides que les handicapés, les cisgenres que les transgenres. Chacun des groupes mieux traités dispose donc de privilège. Les privilèges s'accumulent : Tu es un homme blanc, tu a deux privilèges de plus qu'une femme noire (Oui, on dirait un système de points. Dans les coins les plus immatures des forums SJW, c'est exactement ça.)

Les SJW définissent les individus par rapport au groupes auxquels ils appartiennent, et donc par rapport à leur privilège, avec très peu de regards pour les variations individuelles. Tu es un homme blanc, tu disposes donc du privilège de blanc qui oppresse les noirs, tu es donc raciste par définition. Que tu sois raciste ou non. Le but du SJW est donc de démanteler les privilèges, quels qu'ils soient, se qui se traduit malheureusement par une détestation pas toujours rationnelle des blancs, des hommes, des cis, etc. qu'ils s'empressent de justifier en modifiant les standards sociologiques.

Cette détestation donne des choses bizarres. Les SJW détestent les campagnes anti-racistes dont le message est ""nous sommes tous égaux"", parce que leur but est la réconciliation et non la vengeance. Certains SJW radicaux (et marginaux au sein même du mouvement) rêvent d'une révolution des minorités contre les blancs. J'en connais quelques-uns sur reddit même. Selon les SJW pro-trans, le fait d'être cis est contre nature et le concept de genre n'a aucune base biologique. D'ailleurs, aux US, les SJW font du slacktivism contre la caractérisation du pénis comme ""organe sexuel masculin"" et du vagin comme ""organe sexuel féminin"" parce que c'est cisnormatif.

SRS tient à l'idéologie SJW, à différents degrés selon les membres. Par exemple, il y a peu, il y a eu un thread sur SRSDiscussion expliquant que tout le harcèlement sexuel était le fait d'hommes blancs, et que le fait d'être harcelée sexuellement par des hommes noirs était moins grave, parce que les hommes noirs ne disposent pas d'autant de privilège. Une SJW sur un blog hors-reddit a expliqué qu'elle allait commencer à volontairement habiller son fils en fille et à lui faire regarder des séries ""pour fille"", non pas pour le sensibiliser au féminisme, mais pour éviter à tout prix qu'il devienne hétérosexuel et cis (parce que homme cis-hétéro=caca). Certains sont marxistes en plus, et SRSDiscussion a du récemment rappeler à ses utilisateurs que défendre les actions de Staline n'était pas acceptable.

But let's look at the facts.

Chechans have become increasingly more radicalized. The opposition has gone from being based on the foundations of secular nationalism to Islamic radicalism. 

Terrorist attacks by Chechan groups in not only Russia, but in the United States &amp; Middle East have continued to take place. Chechan veterans have flooded into Syria and other places, while Islamic extremists have also flooded into Chechnya. 

Chechnya is one of the most land mine-affected region worldwide. The majority of Chechens still struggle through lives burdened by fear, uncertainty and poverty. A survey conducted by MSF in September 2005 showed that 77% of the respondents were suffering from *""discernible symptoms of psychological distress""*. As of 2008, the infant mortality rate stood at 17 per 1,000, the highest in Russia; There are reports of growing a number of genetic disorders in babies and unexplained illnesses among school children. One child in 10 is born with some kind of anomaly that requires treatment. 

Many people remain homeless because so much of Chechnya's housing was destroyed by the Russian federal forces and many people have not yet been given compensation. Not only the social *(such as housing and hospitals)* and economic infrastructure but also the foundations of culture and education, including most of educational and cultural institutions, were destroyed over the course of the two wars in Chechnya. Governmental, social and commercial life remain hobbled by bribery, kidnapping, extortion and other criminal activity; reports by the Russian government estimate that the organized crime sector is twice the Russian average and the government is widely perceived to be corrupt and unresponsive.

[Ramzan Kadyrov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramzan_Kadyrov#Accusations_of_human_rights_abuses), the current President of the Chechen Republic, was put in power by a decree from Putin. He's gone on to elevate his cousin to the post of Prime Minister &amp; has been accused of actively building his own *""vertical of power""* in the republic through encouraging nepotism by placing men of the Beno clan in all the leading and important positions.

He has also been personally implicated in several instances of torture and murder. A number of Chechens opposed to Kadyrov have been assassinated abroad, and several witnesses *(including Artur Kurmakaev and Ruslan Khalidov)* report the existence of a 300-name ""Murder List"".

But yeah, **awesome regime change** there. :)

true,Nilbop,IREL,Ireland,"I grew up in a small enough village in a rural area that when a clan of gypsies rolled in with about 20 caravans it'd be a major disruption to the village itself.

The main industry was tourism, and the gypsies would take over (and demolish) the main caravan site; gouging the earth, digging up firepits and destroying outdoor faucets and the public washrooms. The mothers would dander down to the square and try to sell wildflowers to shopowners as they cased the joint, and when the business owner would ask them to leave, they'd lay a curse on them and then send their men around later to wreck and rob. Then there was the issue with making them leave; you couldn't. The PSNI wasn't interested in policing in South Down because we were too Catholic and too near the bandit country in Armagh, and the gippos knew it. So in the end it literally came down to local farmers banding together with guns and dogs and literally driving them off. 

These were the consistent, every-time problems. The one-time-only deals were more outlandish; a gippo drove his 100k merc into a 400 year old oak tree in the town square; a family let their baby take a shit in the holy water font in the church entrance; a bunch of youths slit the throat of the border collie owned by the man who owned the post office, and then hung it outside his building. They even attempted to claim a field used (as in, in *current* use) for cattle as their own because of some longstanding agreement they had apparently had with the field's previous owner and began to dig foundations in the middle of it for a huge mansion. The owner of the field literally brought his sons out and drove straight into their caravan with his JCB.

In short, sometimes ""strong-arming"" these people is the only solution you've got, particularly if you are dealing with a group that think they know what they can get away with and will push that to the absolute limits. If the constabulary want to save the civilians the bother of doing it, all the better.",0,1405606762,null,0,false,0,cizyjdu,t3_2ay3uz,t1_cizyjdu,t1_cizxa13,null,1434760448,23,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,23

true,intangible-tangerine,UKGB,United Kingdom,"A few years ago my friend and I did quite a bit of hitch-hiking around Italy, we were the stereotypical horror-movie victim types; naive females just out of university. The only dangers we encountered is that people would insist on us coming to their house for dinner or coming to their jazz gig or meeting their single sons just out of university. 

Imagine the scene 

'English ladies! Would you like a lift ladies?' 

'That would be nice, we have heard the art Museum in the city centre is good if you're heading that way.' 

'Of course, get in' 

*5 minutes later*

'Is this the right way, the sign said the museum was the other way?

'Yes yes, the Museum later, first we are going to the beach, my wife is making a barbecue for you'

'okay'  

Not exactly Hitchcock material. Not unless the meat was dangerously undercooked on purpose. 

Mind you, my friend did end up marrying one of the guys we met in Italy and now they have two daughters. We didn't meet him hitch-hiking but he helped us navigate the public transport system. He didn't speak much English at the time so we communicated mostly through made-up sign language and facial gestures, which is about 70% of Italian language anyway so it wasn't much of an obstacle. So if you're a female freaked out by the whole womb parasite thing maybe be careful around European men.  


If I were doing it again I would take a few more basic precautions however, as perhaps we were lucky to only have nice drivers. 

* Make sure someone knows where you are travelling to and from and your rough journey time so the alarm can be raised if the worst should happen. 

* Before you get in to a vehicle contact someone reliable, preferably in the country you're travelling through who can speak the language, but if not family and friends at home, with a brief description of the driver, the appearance and make of the vehicle and the registration number.

- Austerity has been a complete failure. Industrial production in the euro area is down to early 2000 leves. The real austerity push came in 2010 and one can see that the small glimpse of hope was destroyed back then. [click](http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?SERIES_KEY=132.STS.M.I6.Y.PROD.NS0020.4.000) It's so bad that Industrial production is performing worse than after the great recession. [click](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/europes-remarkable-achievement/) Keep in mind that these are the numbers of last year. It is now looking even worse.

- Austerity is the attempt to reduce domestic demand by forcing wages lower. Now, this doesn't work. People get fired instead and we see mass unemployment, less demand, less production, even more unemployment, less people being able to pay their debt, more unemployment more bank unable to lend due to terrible balance sheets. At the same time instead of improving the government debt to GDP ratio it makes it worse since the money the government gets from taxes and the GDP falls faster than the reduction in spending.

- Europe unlike the US made banking ""stress tests"" that were worth absolutely nothing. Banks that performed excellently in them failed shortly thereafter. [click](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2014/04/european-stress-tests) They believed they could restore confidence by lying. Didn't work. The same goes for bail out efforts for example in Spain, where the banking bailout failed miserably and the banks today have a higher non-performing loans ratios than before the bailout. [click](http://www.bde.es/webbde/es/estadis/infoest/a0453e.pdf) (pdf) Though doubtfull loans are now falling very slowly they are still at a higher share of total assets (which have also fallen) than before the bailout.

- The ECB has a single job. It has to keep inflation close to but below 2 percent. It is willfully failing at it. Inflation remains significantly below 2 percent. it currently is unchanged at 0.5 percent. [click](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-17072014-AP/DE/2-17072014-AP-DE.PDF=) (pdf). The incompetence of the Germany orthodoxy is to blame. VWL (macro economics) in Germany isn't about thinking it's about repeating a religious mantra. The result is that eventhough efforts are failing we hear exactly the same rethoric as in 2010. Back then we even pushed for higher base rates that made the crisis even worse.

- Propaganda is a massive problem. This is the german industrial production. It has pretty much stagnated for the last three and a half years. Still, Germany is called, powerhouse locomotive, engine, whatever. [click](https://www.destatis.de/DE/ZahlenFakten/Indikatoren/Konjunkturindikatoren/Produktionsindex/kpi111.html?cms_gtp=146006_list%253D3&amp;https=1) the engine has stalled.

- Yes German jobs are up, but real wages remain at the level of 1992 (!!!). Only found a link that shows it back to 1998, but it has been stagnationg since 92. [click](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reallohn#mediaviewer/Datei:Lohnentwicklung_Deutschland.svg) This cannot lead to a high enough increase in consumption. Also, it shows that the German economic level is utterly broken. GDP has increased massively since then, but workers only get very little or nothing in return.

So, what needs to happen? Well, first we have to aknowledge that we have a problem. The industrial production in the euro area might by the end of this year be lower than in 2000. That is a terrible, terrible development and it is a complete failure of the EU leadership and especially Merkel. Instead we get ""journalists"" who sing birthday songs for her. What a joke. 

At least the ECB seems to be now conducting a real stress test, that might clean up bank balance sheets, though we have been fooled far too often to have any real hope that this time will be for real.

The ECB has to do its fucking job. Unbelievable, that they are failing on purpose.

Then we should have state projects that have potential to increase GDP in the future. German roads are in a terrible condition for example, the underinvestment was calculated to be [€100 billion.](http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/kommunen-ohne-neue-schulden-und-ohne-investitionen-a-875742.html) We need to finally get Ariane 6. God damn it the Russians are again developing more modern rockets while we fail to even make a decision. Angares is actually flying (the first test was last month I think) and we are sitting there contemplating that rockets cost money. Yes, but they are an investment in the future. There are a lot of progams that will have a positive effect not only short term, but like in infrastructure over decades to come. Yes that will increase debt in the short term, but the interest is at an all time low, so investing now is cheaper than just letting our streets rot.",0,1405608313,null,0,false,0,cizz7xe,t3_2axuw3,t1_cizz7xe,t1_cizv5iv,null,1434760798,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

&gt; Forced marriage was a unique type of sexual and gender-based violence practiced during the Khmer Rouge rule. To ensure the emergence of the next generation of workers in a union that would naturally provide less family loyalty, and as a corollary decreased opposition to State practices which could be considered a threat to family members, couples were arbitrarily married without choice or consent and pressured to consummate their marriage.

&gt; Statements of survivors collected in Civil Party applications showed that such marriages were organized and held in a systematic manner throughout the country. They took place in impersonal mass ceremonies organized by Khmer Rouge cadres that would involve anywhere from 3 – 160 couples. Shortly before the ceremony couples would be approached and informed that they were to be married.  With the exception of rare instances, usually involving Khmer Rouge cadre, in which men were allowed to select who their wife would be, most couples had no choice in who their partner was, and many had never met their future spouses before. Refusal often resulted in imprisonment, torture or death. Although the details of the ceremonies varied according to location and time, these main features of the mass weddings remained unchanged.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"Obesity also doesn't just appear overnight. It takes years to become a severe problem. There is ample time for an individual to realize their life choices are poor, and turn them around. This is not the case for someone who injured their back on a construction site or something. Also, this just gives more credence to the argument that many people on disabilities are lazy parasites cheating the system. Whoever had the idea to consider morbid obesity a disability that employers need to accommodate is a total idiot. As trucidator said in this thread, this may have cascading effects as employers reconsider hiring overweight people. Why would you hire someone who is overly obese if they can just play the disabilities card to get out of certain duties? I could also imagine employers being forced to pay for a gym membership or something as that may be considered part of a healthcare package that must be provided by the employer. That too would be a terrible decision.

Other people should not be forced to subsidize or accommodate individuals who find themselves in a bad situation because of poor life choices.

true,Athole,null,null,"&gt;When 10 years old, children are split up by their potential (the elementary teachers write a recommendation which is critical for the application to one of 3-5 secondary education levels).  
  
&gt;hat is crazy. Doesn't this essentially pre-determine how their life will be (if you are put in a lower track then you are much more likely to become a mechanic instead of an engineer)?  
  
In NYS we do fundamentally something similar - though we don't actually segregate the classes, which is unfortunate. (1)There are asshole students who had been assholes since 7 years old, who showed no signs of changing, and now signs of caring; (2)there are students who may be slow, but are determined, and they work their asses off to keep up and they deserve every chance of success, (3) there are those who are slow who aren't determined and they lag behind; (4) there are students who are average; (5) students above average; (5) and the very intelligent.  
  
  
In a well funded school district: (1) will often be put into ""basic"" level classes; (3) will often join them... now, the problem is (1) is disruptive and (3) is lazy... unfortunately some (2)s get put in there too. The (2)s can no longer learn... which is a slower paced NYS curriculum. Many (3)s and (1)s drop out, regardless, and few take advantage of any vocational classes the school may offer. The (2)s most definitely do take advantage.  
  
(3)s and (2)s will get their ""regents level classes, which is standard NYS curriculum, some take vocational classes, some don't.  
  
(3)'s and (4-)s get ""honors level"" classes, which is a more indepth NYS curriculum and usually involves taking classes a year in advance and additional science classes - take 9th grade Math in 8th grade so you can take preCalc or Calculus in 12th grade, get an extra year of Science classes so you can get Physics and Chemistry and Biology.  
  
(4+)s and (5)s get AP courses - enough said. Additional years of study crammed into the 4 or 5 years from 78th to 12th grade, depending on the district. Go to college with enough credits to be a second semester sophmore at the age of 18... 
  
The problem is, however, most school districts aren't like that. That was how mine was, and it was great, because well being white and middle class in the United States is great. Most school districts have 1 or 2 levels... In those districts, you have kids  from group (1) and group (5) put together, which, unfortunately, doesn't serve to bring (1) up but more often than not brings (5)s down. We lose a lot of potential for our (5)s because of this. I used to teach at a technical school where most of the people were in the 1-3 category and a few 4s in there because of unfortunate circumstances... It's amazing how easily and how often people can fuck up the flow of a lecture, and these were adults - 25 to 45 years old, mostly - and this is something they were paying close to $20,000 a year to do... I hate to think of how they acted when they were teenagers and it was free.
  
Germany differentiates early, and while, yeah, it sucks, their society values free time enough that people can pursue intellectualism/university/fachhochschulen if they want to later.

Ad un primo incontro piuttosto inconcludente è seguita una seria di lettere aperte ugualmente inconcludenti.

Alla vigilia di questo incontro l'ala più battagliera dei 5stelle ha iniziato a fare pressioni a Di Maio (spesso indicato come il principale esponente di una corrente più istituzionale nei 5stelle e meno oltranzista), perché portasse a casa qualcosa di più concreto - qualsiasi cosa voglia dire.

La situation de base est celle du harcèlement dans la rue, qui est quelque chose de (quasi-)quotidien. Je comprends qu'il soit tentant d'assimiler les deux situations à cause de la réaction de la police, mais la situation de base n'a rien à voir. Tu ne t'es pas fait tabassé juste parce que tu étais toi.

Parlons un peu de la réaction de la Police, commune aux deux situations. On a de plus en plus tendance à blâmer la victime d'un délit/crime si elle n'est pas irréprochable au niveau de son attitude au moment des faits. Rappelez-vous l'histoire du bijoutier de Nice, elle illustre parfaitement ce genre de cas :

- ""Si il n'avait pas braqué la bijouterie, il ne se serait pas fait tirer dessus."" Et ? Depuis quand le code pénal prévoit-il que les braqueurs seront abattu dans le dos par leur victime ?

- ""Si tu n'avais pas sorti ton smartphone dans le noctilien, tu ne te serais pas fait agressé."" Bien sûr ! Qui suis-je pour oser utiliser mon téléphone dans un espace public ?

- ""Vous n'aviez qu'à pas porter une jupe !"" Arf oui. Je me rappellerai que certains hommes sont incapables de se contrôler à la vue de mes mollets.


La différence entre la situation de la BD et la tienne c'est que c'est la seule présence d'une femme dans la rue attire ce genre de comportement de matière quasi-systématique. Jupe ou pas. Eté comme hiver. A toute heure de la journée.

Je suppose, et j'espère, que tu ne t'es pas fait tabasser et voler ton téléphone à chaque fois que tu as sorti celui-ci.

A la relecture (oui, je relis mes posts), on peut avoir l'impression que ce post minimise le fait que tu te sois fait tabassé. Ce n'est absolument pas mon intention.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; This is the same type of argument the Soviets used against the United States. ""And you are lynching Negroes"". Would you think it would be fair for someone in the 70s to say that democracies are inherently racist because they are ""lynching negroes""? Would you accuse them of a ""no true Scotsman"" fallacy if they told you that racism is not an inherent feature of democracy?

Anti-Semitism or lets say suppression of other ethnic and religious groups is a feature of an tribal/feudal society which demands that everybody is the same - a feature of an pre-modern society. However the West has transformed itself in the last 250 years into post-ethnic and post-religious culture and society with a huge value transformation, going from religious based values to values based on ideas gained from humanities and science.

The difference here is that a culture and society are collection of multiple ideas and practices put together. That is why a society can reform and renew by forsaking some ideas and replacing them with new ones.

However what you can't change is ideas and what are their roots. Lets compare...

&gt; Similarly, Christians initiated a ton of violent acts, the crusades, the inquisition and so on, all in the name of their religion. Would you say that the ideas of Christianity are inherently violent and oppressive?

At the heart of the Christian faith is salvation, eternal afterlife, by believing on Jesus, turning the other cheek, not to mention for example things such as 10 commandments: thou shall not kill... The basic here is that while Christians have initiated lots of violence, that violence has been against the core beliefs and ideas of the religion, thus in time the religion and its practitioners have rooted out things that are against those core beliefs...

&gt; Is it so difficult to accept that there are ideas and there are people who do things in the name of these ideas? And sometimes the things they do, do not necessarily reflect the inherent qualities of these ideas? 

Some things can reform, but when you build your whole ideology on class warfare where one group of people commit a genocide of another other group of people, you can't really reform that. That would be akin on saying that National Socialism is actually a very good idea, it was just poorly executed and corrupted by people...",1,1405610568,null,0,false,0,cj00agz,t3_2axr8o,t1_cj00agz,t1_cizzinj,null,1434761249,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

There are only three German universities ranked above Arizona State.

The idea that there are a few good universities that the rich can attend and a bunch of bad universities that everyone else attends, connected with the imagined idea that the German universities rank just below the top US universities is not based on any facts.  

It is based on an ignorant and stereotypical caricature of US society that is somewhat pervasive in Germany.  And while there is, of course, a grain of truth in the stereotype, it is largely inapplicable in this context.

And of course it plays to the German perception that they have an excellent and accessible system of higher education, whereas in reality, it is mediocre by international standards, and still plagued by ""soft"" accessibility problems - see the problems that children of non-Akademiker have, for example.

The US has 2800 4-year degree granting institutions, not 7000.  The 7,000 number includes things like truck driving schools other vocational programs.  The US has 85 schools in the Shanghai 200; Germany has 14.

The ECRH was a response to particular time in history and the UK can be proud of the work of its lawyers in shaping the ECHR regime. However, the circumstances of that particular time in history no longer apply today. There is nothing inherent in human rights legislation that means that it should be at a continental level rather than a national level or a global level.

Recent judgments from the ECHR have conflicted with legislation from the British Parliament, and in particular the right of prisoners to vote. Personally I think that there are good arguments for giving prisoners the vote, but I also think there are arguments against it. However, as a matter of principle I think that the decision over whether or not they vote should be one for the British Parliament rather than the European Court of Human Rights.  So I think it is time for the UK to pull out. The UK has a lengthy and proud tradition of liberties. We really shouldn't take comparisons with Lukashenko very seriously.

true,nihil_baxter,null,null,"No, it doesn't necessarily. Germany basically has three different secondary school qualifications. These are Abitur (12-13 years, Qualification to attend University), Realschulabschluss (10 years, Qualification for almost all vocational training programs) Hauptschulabschluss (9 years, Qualification for limited  vocational training programs). Depending on the state and the school, it can be very different how these are split up. Some teach everyone together until 9th or 10th grade, some split them up but are in the same building and have classes like sports and arts together, some split them up in completely different schools after primary education and some split in Gymnasium (which leads to Abitur) and the other two together until they split again in later years. It's all pretty complicated, but normally there are ways one can transfer between those tiers during the secondary education. Of course this can be quite difficult and require a lot of effort from the students.

Now, after you have your secondary school qualification you can start your tertiary education or in the case of Haupt- and Realschule stay in school and transfer to the next higher tier provided your grades are good enough. There are also some differences in the schools that you can choose and to which qualifications they lead, some qualify you for every University (Abitur) and some qualify you only for Universities of applied sciences (Fachabitur).

If you choose not to get a higher secondary qualification you can start your vocational training (Ausbildung), which usually lasts 2 - 3 years and consists of a mixture of school and on the job training. Of course you can also finish (or not) your vocational training and then get another secondary school qualification and then start to study at a University. 

Three quick stories of three friends of mine:

Friend 1: Went to Gymnasium, transfered to Realschule after 7th grade, got his Realschulabschluss, finished 3 year vocational training, went back to school to get his Fachabitur in one year, went to University, didn't like it, started second vocational training.

Friend 2: Went to Gymnasium, transfered to Realschule after 8th grade, went to another school for 2 years and got his Fachabitur, started 2 year vocational training, didn't like it, started and finished 
second vocational training in 3 years.

Friend 3: Went to Realschule, got his Realschulabschluss, finished 3 year vocational training, worked for a while, got his Fachabitur in one year, started studying at a University of applied sciences.

After this small detour into the German school system, now back to the topic. I think your argument and your sources don't really refute the original point.

true,neutrolgreek,GREE,G.P.R.H Glorious People's Republic of Hellas,"There hasnt been such a thing as ""Macedonian"" Blood since 148 BC you dumb motherfucker

In 148 BC when Makedon fell to Rome and all of Free Greece with it, this destroyed the City-State rule of Greece. 

Over the next 300 years during Rome rule, besides the first years which was the Roman Civil War . . was mostly a peaceful time where all the Greek City-States actually learned about each other and accepted each other Greek Race(there was 4 Greek Races - Doria/Ionian/Aechean/Aeolian)

After Rome Fell the Greek Races Merged to create the Modern Greek Person and they created the greatest Empire known to man, Byzantine. 

Pure Aechean Blood which was the Race the Macedonians were part of stopped existed nearly 2,000 years ago . . the same with Pure Dorian Blood(spartans) and pure Ionian Blood(athenian) . . they all merged to create the Modern Greek. 

1,000 years AFTER the Merger . . the Slavic Push came from up North and the people of Modern Day FYROM came along with it. 

These people overran and conquered the Thracian Race, the Ancient enemies of Greek people and assimilated with them to create the Modern FYROM person. 

Modern FYROM is Slavic/Thracian Blood. 

If you want to say some people from FYROM has Greek blood . . I am 100% fine with that. . but to say they have Blood of a 2,000 YEAR EXTINCT RACE OF GREEK AECHEANS(Macedonians) IS INSANITY. 

I don't give a shit if they want to call themselves Macedonian AS LONG as they Celebrate Greek Culture and Cherish what my Greek Ancestors did. 

But to say that Alexander was 100% Slavic(which is what they do) . . that is not going to go well with me or any other Greek.

The reason for wanting to pull out of the ECHR is not because of the word European. It is to enable the UK parliament to enact legislation it wants. e.g. in relation to prisoners voting.

EDIT after your edit:

&gt; The UK was one of the main nations pushing for an ECHR 50 years ago after all.

It was more than 50 years ago. The UK was right to push for it then, given what had just happened in Europe. Times have now changed. The world has moved on. Rights are not inherently ""European"".

If the USA goes to war... grandpa always knows why. Because it is important to fight the evils. Even if the war reasons are faked (again to name one example). Still, I do love him. But I told him exactly the same you told me about Wirtschafts Nachrichten.

Btw. I have found articles on Wirtschafts Nachrichten that I did disagree with and where I thought ""Well, this is now just a click-bait article"". But as webmaster and SEO I do understand new marketing practices to get social media attention.

So, I get your point and agree with you. But still I don´t disagree with all articles there. Their concept is to get readers like me who are more Euro critical (again just one example). I even heard of friends who never have read any news that they today read them in the internet because they found their voice.

So, what I like about those channels is that they punsh the established channels right in the face. They mobilize people with the same methods as Focus, Welt, Spiegel, ARD, ZDF and what not.

Yes you must be careful. Wherever you read, you will find paid articles, you will find brain wash articles, you will find articles that are political not unattached and so on. It´s just that you now can choose since the internet.

Yes, high quality would be an indipendent magazine. But I do think this is not what you will find often today.

At the end... I agree... I can´t support my claims with numbers as well. Whenever I talk, I just talk about my feelings, about the things I hear from the people around me. No numbers.

3rd May constitution of 1791 reintroduced hereditary monarchy, transferring it back to the Wettin dynasty, who were elected independently as Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III. 

Augustus' heirs could argue to have a degree of legitimacy.
Frederick Augustus, though he initially refused being King of Poland, was installed by Napoleon as a Duke of Warsaw after the partitions. He renounced the title at Congress of Vienna, and the Russian tzar became King of Poland. He died without heirs.

Initially, the Russians did enjoy a degree of acceptance, but eventually the Polish autonomy was abolished, thus ending Kingdom of Poland as any separate construction (Lithuania has been already absorbed into Russia).

This is ridiculous and needs radical improvement. First we need to tighten our (EU's) tax system -- no more dummy-companies on Cyprus, no more double Irish with Netherlands in between sandwich. If that's not enough we need to increase taxes on the rich and lower for the poor. So yeah, 19% is too much when you earn 2800 gross (that's median wage IIRC), so let's make that 10%, but if when you break a threshold you should be taxed to finance the state you're living in.

&gt;How is that fair

Plain and simple. The state is needed to protect poor from the rich, and it needs cash from the rich to to that. It just needs to extract it. The rich can easily afford it to be less rich, the poor have it quite bad already.

I did quite a bit of comparative studies, especially towards welfare systems, and let me tell you: Nobody in the field takes these rankings seriously. They are made up trash because they don't really compare education at all. Instead what they do is to take the AngloSaxon model of higher education as a norm, and they add to that academic standing in reference to each other. The citation index is on of the key indicators - it measures how often papers of one given university refer to papers published by scientists in other universities. This appears to be pretty smart until you realize that this gives a heavy bias towards papers published in English. Minor languages are not as affected because usually their audience is so small that they publish most of their work in English anyway. But medium sized languages like German are at a strong disadvantage. They are big enough to have hundreds of respectable scientific journals. But at the same time they are too small to have much of wider international audience. So the articles published there don't impact the citation index as much as the same number of papers in English journals. From my own experience I can say this: When writing a paper I am rather unlikely to quote an author who published in a language I do not know, even though he may have written something that fits perfectly. 

Another major point: Academic standing does not equal academic education. ",1,1405614663,null,0,1405614907,0,cj02f37,t3_2awjcn,t1_cj02f37,t1_cj00ldw,null,1434762278,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

La verità (che a nessuno piace dover riconoscere proprio perché ritenersi rappresentati da gente un po' meno merda di noi ci fa sentire meglio per riflesso) è che la politica  - proprio perché fatta da esseri umani - funziona esattamente come il nostro ufficio, la nostra classe, il nostro gruppo sociale quale che sia. E l'esperienza insegna che ovunque ci siano umani ci sono rivalità, invidie, conflitti, camarille varie in lotta per affermarsi l'una sull'altra. 

Non che questo voglia dire trascurare il lato produttivo: i politici della cosa pubblica si occupano fin troppo e concretizzano fin troppo (che tutto questo non finisca sui giornali a differenza degli scazzi di partita interna è verissimo, ma è anche un altro discorso), solo che collateralmente alla gestione della cosa pubblica tributano grandi attenzione e sforzi pure alla partita interna. Questo - di nuovo - non perché siano delle particolari merdacce, ma proprio perché sono esattamente come tutti noi (il che è persino consolante: siamo o no nella democrazia rappresentativa?) e pertanto funzionano come tutti noi, con le nostre furbizie, le nostre ripicchette e le nostre meschinità.

What public services? Most public services are dramatically OVERfinanced and overstaffed. 
Zus should be basically one computer program, there's no room for interpretation here. It's just simple algorithm. What exactly are all that workers doing? It costs 4 billion zł a year.   
The only thing that requires actual human workers is control &amp; auditing.  

Old people are the biggest parasite now and biggest leeches of public funds. Why exactly do I have to pay the pension for some old guy I don't even know? That essentially makes me his slave.  

The net result is big emigration of normal workers and declining birth rates.  

&gt;The NFZ contracts on some services are out by march.

NFZ is basic healthcare for poor people. It's needed because it keeps prices in check, us model is a failure. But that's all it is. Poland is just too poor to afford good healthcare for everyone, drugs and tools costs the same whether you're Switzerland or Poland. Even labor costs are absolute, not relative to gdp - if kept too low, doctors just emigrate.  

&gt;The state is needed to protect poor from the rich,

The opposite. The state is there to protect the haves from have-nots, to uphold private property rights. 
It was always like that.  

Also I'm not even rich, just middle class. 

&gt;I would shed no tear if you emigrated, believe me. But of course you wouldn't. I really won't be missing people who are so desperate for not giving back to society that they prefer to leave than to contribute

I already gave back more than I took and it's only going to increase. At 60% income tax over 180k it's sure as hell I would emigrate. 
I guess I could get back eventually, with income already taxed at 0% in Dubai. Half a year is all that's required for tax residency. So your 60% rate would just mean a loss of 19%.

Ich für meinen Teil verstehe zu wenig von diesem schon Jahrzehnte dauernden Konflikt in dieser Region, um mir eine Meinung zu bilden. Wie bei so vielen anderen Themen halte ich, wenn ich dann keine Ahnung habe, in der Tat auch die Klappe. Im Nordirland-Konflikt verhält sich das ähnlich für mich.

Zu verlangen, ich möge mich besser über die Welt informieren, ist durchaus legitim. Man soll als mündiger Weltbürger ja durchaus ein Bewusstsein für Konflikte auf der Welt haben. Soweit, so legitim.

Einer Kategorisierung scheine ich dadurch leider nicht zu entgehen. Israel-Kritiker und Antisemit wurde ich schon genannt, nur weil ich mich nicht *aktiv* pro-Israel positioniere. Den Konflikt durch Fragen an darin (geistig) sehr involvierte Menschen besser verstehen zu können fällt mir da auch schwer, oft begegnet einem dabei Aggression in der Argumentation und Schuldzuweisung.

Das möchte ich Dir jetzt nicht alles vorwerfen, nachdem Dein Beitrag aber in die Richtung zielt und ich mich als „Teil des Problems“ angesprochen fühle, wollte ich jetzt mal nachfragen, wie Du zu meinem Standpunkt stehst:

Kann man legitim außerhalb dieses Konflikts stehen? Habe ich die Pflicht, mich nicht nur zu informieren sondern auch Partei zu ergreifen? Kann ich nicht stattdessen insgesamt gegen Tod und Leid auf der Welt sein, ohne mich in einen Konflikt involvieren zu müssen, der ohnehin so weit von meinem Wirkungskreis entfernt ist, dass ich wenig machen kann, außer nicht zu Demonstrationen zu gehen, die „Kindermörder“ skandieren (habe ich von beiden Seiten schon gehört, daher erstmal so dahin gestellt)?

In späteren Posts bestreitet er, dass die Seperatisten etwas damit zu tun haben weil sie ""nicht in der Lage wären Flugzeuge in dieser Höhe (10.000m) abzuschießen"". Und behauptet die ""verfügbaren Flugabwehrraketen hätten nur eine Maximalweite von 3.000m"".

Allerdings wurde vorher behauptet das Flugzeug mit dem Buk-System abgeschossen zu haben, dieses kann Flugzeuge in deutlich größerer Höhe abschießen. Siehe z.B. hier: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buk_M1

Auf der VK-Seite wird damit geprahlt die An-26 abgeschossen zu haben, die sich später als Boeing 777 herausstellt. Auch Videos werden gepostet: http://vk.com/video-57424472_169431623?list=d4ac7d7bd38f96cbeb

Lastly, all i said was that plane was shot down, the only planes that flew around those parts were Ukrainian military jets/bombers, who did exactly what they were made for - bombed and killed people/tech.

true,putin_is_gay,null,null,"Es gibt keinen ""wahren Atheismus"". Es gibt viele Leute, die sich selbst Gedanken machen und versuchen, sich von der Fremdherrschaft über ihre Meinungen zu befreien. So kann man übrigens den Glauben definieren: Fremdherrschaft über die eigene Meinung, und zwar aus Einsicht in die eigene Inkompetenz, eine sinnvolle Meinung bilden zu können. Woher soll man wissen, was richtig oder falsch ist? Soll man Fehler machen, um daraus zu lernen? Oder hat man aus der Geschichte gelernt, sich an bestimmte, allgemeingültige Regeln zu halten? Religiöser Glaube und damit die Unterwerfung unter eine Autorität kann durchaus sinnvoll sein, sowohl für einen selbst als auch für das Umfeld. ""Virtue ethics"" beansprucht immerhin ziemlich viele kognitiven Ressourcen.

Aber es funktioniert nicht mehr. Ich zumindest bin nicht in der Lage, an einen der angebotenen Götter zu glauben. Die meissten Religionen sind so überfrachtet mit Bilden und Geschichten aus völlig fremden Kontexten, mit Dingen, die man nicht wörtlich nehmen kann, neben Dingen, die dann aber absolute Autorität beanspruchen. Da habe ich so keinen Zugang. Versuche ich die Sachen zu übersetzen, zum Beispiel a la Feuerbach oder gar Hegel, dann macht vieles Sinn, und zwar auf psychologischer, anthropologischer oder soziologischer Ebene. Aber dann fällt die ganze transzendente Ebene, also Gott, weg. Und dann fällt auch das Gebot, dass die Sachen so bleiben wie sie sind, weg. Übrig bleiben oftmals ganzheitliche Ideologien, die man als menschengemacht und mehr oder weniger vernünftig ansehen kann. Aber aus der Perspektive kann man schwer ""glauben"", oder? Man kann ""für richtig halten"" oder als sinnvoll ansehen"", aber ist das Glaube?

Die Probleme, für welche die Religionen Lösungen boten, sind immerwährend. Aber viele Menschen suchen nach neuen Lösungen, und die meissten sind sich dabei bewusst, dass diese neuen Lösungen anders funktionieren müssen. Das könnte dann so klingen: Wir wollen keinen neuen Gott oder Gott-Ersatz, wir wollen lernen, mit unserer Freiheit umzugehen. Da war doch letzthin auch ein Artikel über ""Religion ohne Gott"", Ronald Dworkin, auf reddit. 

Ich denke, Atheismus zeichnet sich durch viele Fragezeichen aus und durch den Versuch, mit den Fragezeichen umzugehen. Nicht so sehr durch klare Antworten auf unbeantwortbare Fragen, wie es Religionen eben tun. Dass die Wissenschaft immer mehr in Bereiche vordringt, die unser Menschenbild berührt und die ein oder andere Gewissheit dadurch umgeworfen wird, heisst nicht, dass die Wissenschaft Anworten auf jene Fragen geben kann oder dies beansprucht.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; Canada and Australia have proper judicial constitutional review of legislation, the UK doesn't.

Under current UK human rights legislation, there is quasi judicial review of human rights legislation (see [s4 of the Human Rights Act](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/section/4). I envisage something similar in any British bill of rights.

&gt; Would you support judicial review too, or is that too much against parliamentary sovereignty?

In the UK parliament is sovereign. Obviously, we have judicial review in relation to the actions of the state, but not in relation to primary legislation as it is enacted. Personally I am comfortable, given the UK's history and temperament, with parliament having ultimate sovereignty. I think to the extent Parliament is enacting legislation that contravenes any British Bill of Rights, they should do so expressly. Then ultimately it will be up to the electorate to respond.

&gt; 2) Why settle for ok, when you can have better?

What I want is better. I think the UK will get something better outside the ECHR. You and I probably mean something else by ""better"".

&gt; 3) I think all the British people that have managed to protect their rights against the actions of the British government thanks to the ECHR, the majority of whom I'd wager are not criminals, would probably disagree that you would ""manage just right"". When it comes to rights, I'd rather err on the side of caution, even if it leads to some decisions you might not like.

Can you give me some examples of British people that won cases against the British government who wouldn't win them if the UK pulled out of the ECHR and enacted alternative legislation? Ultimately I trust the UK parliament to enact legislation that British people want. I am not proposing that the UK has no human rights legislation at all.",1,1405617286,null,0,false,0,cj03uja,t3_2aybcr,t1_cj03uja,t1_cj03fyf,null,1434762930,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; Paris Commune failed

It lasted more than two months, I would argue there was more than enough time. 

&gt;  however they executed what ever prisoners they had when the end was near.

The level of hypocrisy here is astounding. Did you even read the article you linked to? Here: 

&gt; As the army continued its slow advance, the summary executions of hundreds of suspected Communards by the army continued. Informal military courts were established at the École Polytechnique, Chatelet, the Luxembourg Palace, Parc Monceau, and other locations around Paris. The hands of captured prisoners were examined to see if they had fired weapons. The prisoners gave their identity, sentence was pronounced by a court of two or three gendarme officers, the prisoners were taken out and sentences immediately carried out.[70]

&gt; Amid the news of the growing number of massacres carried out by the army in different parts of the city, some Communards carried out their own executions as a desperate and futile attempt at retaliation. Raoul Rigaut, the chairman of the Committee of Public Safety, without getting the authorization of the Commune, executed one group of four prisoners, before he himself was captured and shot by an army patrol. On 24 May, a delegation of national guardsmen and Gustave Genton, a member of the Committee of Public Safety, came to the new headquarters of the Commune at the city hall of the 11th arrondissment and demanded the immediate execution of the hostages held at the prison of La Roquette. The new prosecutor of the Commune, Théophile Ferré, hesitated and then wrote a note: ""Order to the Citizen Director of La Roquette to execute six hostages."" Genton asked for volunteers to serve as a firing squad, and went to the La Roquette prison, where many of the hostages were being held. Genton was given a list of hostages and selected six names, including the Archbishop of Paris and three priests. The governor of the prison, M. François, refused to give up the Archbishop without a specific order from the Commune. Genton sent a deputy back to the Prosecutor, who wrote ""and especially the archbishop"" on the bottom of his note. The archbishop and five other hostages were promptly taken out into the courtyard of the prison, lined up against the wall, and shot.[71]

The army killed hundreds of suspected Communards. The Communards killed six in retaliation. I have never before in my life seen such a stupid and blatant disregard for the truth.

He said the EU and NATO are not the world's police which IMO is a gross oversimplification and outright bullshit buzzword in regards to this situation. 

Of course there's a huge amount of differing opinions and interests inside the EU that makes it difficult to form a united front against an outsider. Anybody could have seen that coming. Hell here in the US we certainly have that problem and we're insanely more integrated than the EU. 

This whole thing is a tragedy but I find it sickening that apparently there are some people who felt the entire Ukrainian situation wasn't noteworthy until a ""plane full of Europeans"" (never mind that there's been no report of what nationalities were on board yet) goes down.

Also apparently responding to Russian attacks on a sovereign nation that has shown desire to be friendly to the West and the **EU** (remember how just a few months ago they were waving EU flags on the barricades of the Maidan? Apparently all of Western Europe forgot) and now Russian backed separatists have apparently shot down a civilian airliner is ""antagonizing Russia"".

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Also, policemen who run out of gas budget, schools that are closed because there aren't funds to teach children in the rural regions, road services that need to prioritize which potholes will they patch, because they have only so much budget. 

This is true everywhere. There's always more to do than money.  

&gt;Go talk with a disabled person, ask them about the UX of the program they'd like to allow their rent.  

That's not what those bureaucrats do. That's a job for a commission of doctors.  

I have a friend who worked in some bureau, something to do with water. A small high-rise, he was the IT guy. He could watch what they were doing first hand. About 90% of their time was spent on nasza-klasa (this was when it was big in Poland). 

The reason is because if a local office sees that they don't need that much money, if they don't spend it, they're going to get less next year. So they spend it on bullshit. Same with employing people. It's better to have an overemployment rather than under, because asking for more money is seen badly and can be refused.    

&gt;Moreover, it's the only place you're going to get treatment because private companies won't deal with things more expensive than a corporate employee flu.  

You can pay for treatment in state-owned hospitals if you want to get better treatment. I don't mean bribes, bribes are for getting better treatment while hospital bills nfz.  
I don't see anything wrong in the existence of state-owned hospitals, they can be profitable too.  

&gt;Three words: the french revolution. 

Which didn't last long, then Napoleon came and everything reverted to general norm, just with some new people in power.  
French revolution ended the dying feudal aristocracy (a system where power is reserved for those of noble birth) and replaced it with early form of capitalism (a system where power depends mainly on money, not birth).  
Even the October revolution just replaced a unique Russian mix of half-feudal lords, half-capitalists with new elites - first security services, then later party bureaucrats.  

It's just the natural state of being for humans.  

&gt;Oh, and you would take your factory/shop with you to Dubai, right? Fine, go do it.

My entire income is from online, international businesses which makes relocation especially easy for me.  
I only said I would do it under 60% tax.  

&gt;because if I had anything to say about it, all agreements about double taxation avoidance would be deleted. That's what I call tighetning taxation system.  

Double taxation agreements have nothing to do with tax residency. Changing tax residency doesn't work only if you're a citizen of either USA or Eritrea, as they are the only ones who tax their citizens on their entire income even if they live elsewhere. Which is why so many rich US citizens renounce their citizenship.   

Double taxation agreements can't limit the amount of paid tax (loopholes are quickly patched, like with Cyprus), it just means if you paid 17% while working somewhere (where you don't have tax residency) you only pay 1% in Poland.  
Removing these agreements would only make tax evasion much more common.  ",0,1405619461,null,0,false,0,cj0528g,t3_2ay1zs,t1_cj0528g,t1_cj03ne7,null,1434763501,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The same thing that worked for all other recessions in the last 100 years: expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. Which translates to debt-based stimulus spending and a big expansion of the monetary base to raise inflation and help countries and families pay down their debts.

The only difference now is that most of Europe is under a supernational central bank, so it needs to be that bank that adopts expansionary monetary policy and it needs to be European institutions that enact debt-based stimulus spending.

En tant que citoyens on peut se demander s'il est opportun qu'un syndicat historiquement inspiré par le marxisme ait une telle influence chez les magistrats.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; You've been arguing that the UK could easily afford disaster assistance and therefore didn't need EU money, but at the same time argue that their contribution to the EU is way too expensive. That does not compute.

My argument against the disaster assistance is that this money should go to poorer countries, rather than richer countries. Poorer countries, by definition need disaster assistance more than richer countries.

In relation to the EU budget, my argument is that it should be, as between different countries, equitable. That means that the net payments should reflect GDP of countries and net benefits.

&gt; You're in favour of furthering your own interests by any means, even if cooperation should be necessary, let's phrase it that way. It clears things up.

All countries are in favour of furthering their interests. You presumably believe that your country should further its interests too?

&gt; So there was no political consciousness, and suddenly there was one, and you obviously think it turned out okay. Why not give the EU the same chance?

The political consciouness that developed did not supplant existing political consciounesses that were reluctant to be supplanted. This is different from the case of the UK and the EU.

Yes, you do. You think that ""the UK's net payments start to become grossly unfair in comparison to other countries"".

&gt;France and the UK have equivalent wealth. Therefore it does not make sense for the UK to be subsidising French agriculture.

The UK is not subsidizing French agriculture, the EU is subsidizing EU agriculture (for a host of reasons).

&gt;I find it astonishing that you think that it is right that the UK gets much less out of the EU budget than France does.

If we were to subsidize fishing, then the landlocked countries would receive nothing either... and that wouldn't be because we would hate the Czechs and Austrians, but that's just where the seas are. And France happens to be where the farmers are. Start farming more, and you'll get more.

&gt;I can only assume that this comes from a hatred of the UK.

A typical case of projection, with your jealousy of France.

&gt;And this should only happen in circumstances in which the region benefitted is less wealthy than the region providing the benefits.

If you think that the CAP should be modified to be more generous for poor countries, be my guest to propose in the EP. Because that's how you fix bad laws, not by sulking in the corner.

https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicat_de_la_magistrature#Actions_et_.C3.A9volution_de_la_magistrature

Baudot, substitut à Marseille et membre du SM, s'inscrit dans cette lutte des « petits » contre les « gros » propre à cet esprit soixante-huitard. Il adresse en août 1974 un texte à cent trente collègues intitulé « Harangue à des magistrats qui débutent » (souvent appelée « Harangue de Baudot »). Dans ce texte contestataire, il critique la répression et invite ses collègues à corriger, dans leurs décisions, les déséquilibres induits par les hiérarchies sociales : « Soyez partiaux. Pour maintenir la balance entre le fort et le faible, le riche et le pauvre, qui ne pèsent pas d’un même poids, il faut que vous la fassiez un peu pencher d’un côté »

**Cette injonction de partialité s'accompagne d'une recommandation à violer le droit si nécessaire** : « Dans vos fonctions, ne faites pas un cas exagéré de la loi et méprisez généralement les coutumes, les circulaires, les décrets et la jurisprudence. Il vous appartient d’être plus sage que la Cour de cassation, si l'occasion s’en présente »

Et avant que tu me dises que ces déclarations n'engagent pas le syndicat, ou qu'ils ont changé ; ils ont eux-mêmes à nouveau mis ce discours dans [leur film](http://www.syndicat-magistrature.org/Le-Syndicat-de-la-magistrature,856.html) de 2009.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;My argument against the disaster assistance is that this money should go to poorer countries, rather than richer countries. Poorer countries, by definition need disaster assistance more than richer countries.

The money is distributed based on the amount of disasters, which automatically means those who need it most get it, and that's already to the advantage of poorer countries. It's completely inconsequential to argue to receive even less when at the same time you're complaining you're not getting enough out of the deal.

&gt;In relation to the EU budget, my argument is that it should be, as between different countries, equitable. That means that the net payments should reflect GDP of countries 

They do. You even get a rebate, so you pay relatively less than other countries relative to your GDP.

&gt;and net benefits.

You can't let contributions reflect two things at once, that's just setting it up for failure. As I said, if benefits have to be the same as contributions everyone can pay for themselves and redistribution is impossible.

Would you suddenly think the relative greater payments were okay if more expenses were done in Eastern and Southern Europe and give up the rebate? No, you wouldn't. Because then you'd be arguing to change policy at the EU level to make that true. It's all just an excuse you make up to justify your pre-existing position against the EU.

&gt;All countries are in favour of furthering their interests.

Then stop hypocritical babble about wanting cooperation if you take that position.

&gt;The political consciouness that developed did not supplant existing political consciounesses that were reluctant to be supplanted.

It's beyond doubt that the local nobility, clergy and influential people of the local polities did not want their local power to be supplanted by a heavily centralized state ruled by London. It's ironic (or hypocritical) that one of the most centralized states of Europe is reluctant to even the slightest centralization when it's in the other position.

&gt; The UK is not subsidizing French agriculture, the EU is subsidizing EU agriculture (for a host of reasons).

You are proposing that the UK doesn't get the rebate any more. This would effectively mean a tranfer of money from the UK to France.

&gt; If we were to subsidize fishing, then the landlocked countries would receive nothing either... and that wouldn't be because we would hate the Czechs and Austrians, but that's just where the seas are. And France happens to be where the farmers are. Start farming more, and you'll get more.

It would be a huge mistake to subsidise fishing, just as it is a huge mistake to subsidise farming. 

&gt; A typical case of projection, with your jealousy of France.

I love France, I am a massive francophile. You do seem to hate the UK though.

&gt; If you think that the CAP should be modified to be more generous for poor countries, be my guest to propose in the EP. Because that's how you fix bad laws, not by sulking in the corner.

The best thing to actually help real poor countries in Africa would be to get rid of the CAP altogether and trade freely with them. That is what the UK should propose. Hopefully when the UK pulls out of the EU we will do that.

&gt; You've just been arguing that you weren't getting enough out of the EU deal, and now you're arguing that you're so wealthy you don't need help?

Based on which standard? You're just saying ""less than it is now"", you don't have a specific goal you want to reach or principle that guides you.

&gt;You are proposing that the UK doesn't get the rebate any more. This would effectively mean a tranfer of money from the UK to France.

No, a transfer from the UK to the other net contributing countries who now make up for the refusal for the UK to contribute.

&gt;It would be a huge mistake to subsidise fishing, just as it is a huge mistake to subsidise farming.

And no doubt there are plenty of UK policies you consider a huge mistake, but that's not ground to call for a dissolution of the UK or an exist of your county.

&gt;I love France, I am a massive francophile. You do seem to hate the UK though.

Go psychologize someone else.

&gt;The best thing to actually help real poor countries in Africa would be to get rid of the CAP altogether and trade freely with them. That is what the UK should propose. Hopefully when the UK pulls out of the EU we will do that. 

Don't weasel out, we're talking about the benefits EU members get from the EU budget. Would you be satisfied when poorer EU members would receive the net benefits rather than France? Would you give up the rebate then?

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; Yeah, I know there's quasi-review, that's why I said proper review. In my view, it's not much of a review if it's purely declarative without the actual power to strike down legislation. Of course, it's your right to be satisfied with this and believe informal mechanisms are sufficient but I was just saying that most states which you used as examples of why the UK out of the ECHR would be ok disagree with such a view and have thus enacted additional safeguards the UK doesn't have, meaning they are not really good examples.

The whole of the UK's unwritten body of constitutional law is based on the effective working of informal measures. Formally the Queen has to approve all legislation but informally she has no right not to approve it. As a constitutional system, I admit that the UK's system is pretty much unique. But informal measures in the UK work surprisingly well.

Australia and Canada both have written consitutions - thus their framework for rights legislation is specifically judiciable. The UK, without a constitution, has to approach rights in a different way. I'm not sure how well you know the UK, but it is a pretty liberal place. I'm really not worried about rights here. 

&gt; Better for individuals because it gives them an additional means of protecting their rights.

I'm not sure why the ECHR system would be better for individuals than the British Bill of Rights. Also, rights, as a concept, tend not to be absolute. Your right not to see me wear a veil conflicts with my right to wear one. Your right to privacy conflicts with my right to free expression. The balancing line between competing rights in my mind might find better expression at the national level, with the national parliament having final say.

&gt; I thought the Anglosphere was big on individual rights and individuality.

The US is big on ""rights"". The UK is big on ""liberties"". We're both big on indviduality. I don't think the ECHR is really something that is connected to individuality.

&gt; I don't know if you saw my edit so I'll link this overview of UK ECHR cases again

I took a look (and thanks) but unfortunately these two sentence summaries of the relevant cases told me nothing at all. As a lawyer, I would really need more information before I could come to a view about it.

It's far from the only one. But this one was shot down not by stupid rebel fucks who can't tell AN-26 from a B-777, but by trained US Navy personnel who thought the A300 was an F-14, which is a mistake so stupid that my brain hurts from even reading the explanation. Mind you, the US never even apologised for it. 

Rebels are stupid, but that's hardly news. They're not trained army men mostly. If the well-trained US Navy an mistake an A300 for an F-14 with their sophisticated radar aboard a massive cruiser, then I think it is very easy to understand how rebels in Ukraine would make a similar mistake, except that the flight they mistook was off course and the passenger airplane was confused for transport airplane, which isn't as bad as confusing a passenger airplane for a fighter jet. Especially when the US warship could have easily tried to communicate with the A300. 

&gt;Who could have predicted that both Russian military and its pawns will prove that stupid?

Again, read the explanation I made. I challenge you to go on a crude radar tracker and tell the difference. You wouldn't be able to do it on a sophisticated one either. It's not simple. Mistakes happen, everyone makes them. The real mistake was deviating off course and flying right over Donetsk, as the Malaysian flight did. Well, that and also supplying the rebels.

&gt;The comments by the top military commander of the self-proclaimed ""Donetsk People's Republic"" suggest the separatists had shot down the Malaysia Airlines plane by mistake, believing it was a large Ukrainian army transport plane. 


&gt;""We just downed an An-26 near Torez. It is down near the Progress mine,"" said the VK page attributed to Igor Strelkov, which is frequently quoted by Ukrainian media.


Quelle: http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysian-passenger-plane-with-295-on-board-crashes-in-ukraine-near-russian-border/article1-1241551.aspx

Eine weitere Selbstbezichtigung (oder die gleiche, anders zitiert?):

&gt;A post on the VKontakte social networking service apparently from Igor Girkin, commander of the Donbass People's Militia, acknowledged shooting down an aircraft at approximately the same time in approximately this location, claiming it was a Ukrainian military transport plane. According to Google Maps, Rassypnoye (where Girkin claims to have shot down the plane) is 6km from Hrabove, where MH17 crashed. 

&gt;An Associated Press reporter on Thursday saw seven rebel-owned tanks parked at a filling station outside the eastern Ukrainian town of Snizhne, a few miles southeast of the crash site. In the town, he also observed a Buk missile system, which can fire missiles up to an altitude of 22,000 metres (72,000 feet)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_17

Nachtrag: 

""Igor Strelkow"" und ""Igor Girkin"" sind vermutlich ein und der selbe Separatistenführer, einmal mit Tarnnamen und richtigem. Und der hat nach dem Bekanntwerden der Katastrophe prompt versucht, seine früheren Aussagen  zu löschen, um stattdessen Propaganda zu verbreiten:

&gt;After news that emerged that a commercial airliner had been taken down and its 300 passengers and crew likely killed Mr. Girkin reportedly erased his claims from his page on VKontakte, a Russian social media site that's similar to Facebook.

&gt;The records of internet archive site The Wayback Machine (WM) appear to confirm that Girkin made such a claim and erased it soon thereafter.

So wurde aus:

&gt;""In the vicinity of Torez, we just downed a plane, an AN-26. It is lying somewhere in the Progress Mine. We have issued warnings not to fly in our airspace. We have video confirming. The bird fell on a waste heap. Residential areas were not hit. Civilians were not injured."" 

Stattdessen dieses:

&gt;The Prime Minister of the DNR Alexander Borodai has officially confirmed the fact of the falling of the passenger plane near Toreza. At the crash site and investigative team of the general prosecutor's office of the DNR is working. The DNR is interested in an objective investigation of this incident and is prepared to give foreign investigators access to the crash site. 

&gt;Alexander Borodai believes this is a provocation by Ukrainian siloviki [hawks]. The DNR doesn't have anti-aircraft weapons capable of hitting a passenger plane flying at the cruising altitude of air routes. The ceiling of our own anti-aircraft weapons is 2.5 km. The cruising altitude of passenger planes is considerably greater. The Ukrainian side, as early as July 14, announced that it was putting its air defenses into combat readiness.

France pays the largest share of this. Also, given that the UK is a net contributor, you shouldn't say that the UK is refusing to contribute.

Frankly, pointing out that benefits should go to the real poor in the world is common sense, not weasling out of anything.

Withdrawing from the Court's jurisdiction.

&gt;In my mind this is exactly the kind of reason why the UK should pull out of the ECHR. Hearsay evidence should be allowed in a court in exceptional circumstances. This was one of them


I`m not willing to go into a debate if you think hearsay should be allowed or not, but the Court considers that it's a violation of fair trial. You may agree or disagree when you look into it further. It's really not my main point. 

Those were just the cases I was more familiar with, and examples of the UK having been guilty of human rights abuses.Proud tradition of legality is not an argument.I`m positive that there are a lot more cases from the UK,just as much as there are from Germany or France, or any other country with a tradition of rule of law. 

If you feel that your government is too limited and want it to have that kind of power without international review, then we can agree to disagree. Most people enjoy having their governments overlooked by an impartial international Court with human rights at heart.

Great, I think state-owned hospitals are good idea, too. I just don't think their goal is to ""be profitable"". Hospitals, like schools, roads, kindergardens, police and firefighters are a cost, but a necessary cost. They do not exist to bring profit.

&gt;Which didn't last long

And yet, since then we see the state are a guardian of all the citizens, especially the disenfranchised, like the poor who are (*especially* in capitalism) exploited by the rich. It is directly in the ideal role of the state to protext them from exploitation.

&gt;My entire income is from online
Yeah, I thought so. It's easy to imagine that every company takes their things and goes away, but we're (online companies and services) a pretty small slice of the whole economy. Not everything could be offshored, and frankly -- mostly the exploitative, slave jobs. Exercise: whay would happen, if software companies taxes went up twice in Poland? Answer: Nothing, because they'd still be twice as much cheaper than their western counterparts.

&gt;Double taxation agreements have nothing to do with tax residency.
Then how would you operate in Poland without tax residency? Because in world, that would be impossible. Want to operate in my country? Pay my country's taxes. 

I don't see how removing double taxation agreement would make tax evasion easier. If anything, that would make tax office work easier. The company has profit -----&gt; pay up, bitch.",0,1405623893,null,0,false,0,cj07jd9,t3_2ay1zs,t1_cj07jd9,t1_cj0528g,null,1434764730,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

In my mind it is exactly the point. Here the UK courts thought it was a fair trial, but not the ECHR. Why are you so happy with judgments coming from the ECHR but not with judgments coming from the UK courts? If the UK courts were right in this case (and in my view they were) nobody's ""rights"" were abused.

Yes, really. 

Painting nations/ cultures/ religions/ ethnicities with such broad brush strokes, *especially* when using negative stereotypes is what results in or strengthens racism/ xenophobia etc.  

Off course there are cultural differences among nations/ regions. But it is an *awful* practice to single out either a country, or region, or race and claim ""X are all like Z"". There is a way of stating general problems amongst a certain culture without involving all of the people involved in it. Using you previous statement, instead of saying:

&gt;Russians are being raised that if there's a problem, the stronger guy wins the argument. They have no knowledge of discussions, they don't even think about finding solutions like that.

you could say:

“One of the problems still often encountered in the Russian culture is that strength, rather than a rational quite discussion is the best way to solve a problem. The ""mighty Russia"" mentality still prevails among many people, with many considering Putin as the Czar or Russia, the strong hand that is needed. This needs to change is order for Russia to come closer to European ideals of human rights. “

That was neither difficult nor offends millions of Russians who in fact are not raised to think that the strongest guy is the winner, who do have a knowledge of discussion, and do think of other solutions. 

&gt;Go into a box club in your town

Go to the mathematics of physics institute in any bigish university. I bet you will find Russian or ex-USSR people there. Go to galleries, exhibitions. Go to the space station.

&gt; Ask people how they view Russian tourists

I have heard terrible things about Japanese/ American/ Israeli etc tourists. This is really not a great way to gauge the mentality of a whole people. It is a great way to bring out the racist side of people, though.  

&gt; Ask Poles, Czechs, Estonians what they think about Russian culture and politics.

Interesting how you drew a line with Poles and Czechs, although they are also Eastern European, have Slavic languages and share many of the traditions and cultural background with other Eastern Europeans. 

&gt;I don't like generalising either

Then don’t. If you care about decreasing racism and xenophobia, please for the love of the FSM learn how to express your views in a much less generalized and offensive way.

Sometimes you have to know someone to get in, but there are some open to the public. Also keep your eye out for ""Noches Especiales"" which tend to take over the center of the city with music, arts and crafts, and activities. 

There is also a nice bar called La Gotera which has nice, intimate music performances and a pretty decent bartender. La Gotera is on Calle Juan Morrison 14 (it is blue and looks closed down, but it's not!). For nice teas and things to drink, The Gallery in Plaza Mayor is an ideal place and they have bomb-diggity cakes that are delicious. Plus you can get some really nice Moroccan tea (té moruno). 

For other places to go, I recommend going to La Perseverancia on Calle Sevilla (also called la calle Ancha) which has really good tapas for really good prices. It's also a great place for people-watching! It's near the McDonalds and the bookstore and you walk inside near the tattoo parlor. I highly recommend the pechuga borracha and el rollito de la abuela. Also Mi Querida which is on Calle Alfonso XI (only open Thurs, Fri, and Saturday for dinner), is another hidden gem in Algeciras that people often overlook. Get a seat at the bar and chat up the chef when he pops out: He's a brilliant guy from Argentina who's super friendly and loves to have a nice conversation.  

From time to time, the Hotel Reina Cristina has special events. There was a salsa competition and dance classes in May, there was some sort of expo a few months prior, too. It's a fun way to meet people and to learn some new stuff. 

Another activity that is popular in neighboring Tarifa is kite-sailing. It's a very nice community with lots of awesome people who are more than willing to help you out. A friend of mine is a huge participant in the scene. 

Algeciras' city government also puts on a lot of free stuff related to Andalusian culture. Check out their Facebook page and their [official page](http://www.algecirasmegusta.com/) to see what else they can offer.

If you contribute and receive the same amount in relative to GDP, there's no redistribution and the exercise becomes pointless. Stop making circular arguments.

&gt;So you think the EU budgets have been failures for the last 25 years?

EU budgets have served EU policies, for better or worse. I don't even need to see how that impacted individual countries.

&gt; Of course contributions can and should reflect both who contributes but also who benefits. That is obvious.

Then you can't have redistribution, making the exercise pointless. Stop making circular arguments.

&gt;This is not hypocritical. Both parties can benefit from cooperation. The reason why I'd want it is because my country is one of the parties.

You're hypocritical if you say you want cooperation in general. You don't.

While we are in Frankfurt: One of the nearby castles features a frequent medieval market &amp; show that is always worth a visit (including a medieval Christmas market).


Beer: There is not just one brewery per federal country, that would be horrible. About every City has one or more breweries!
Darmstadt in the South of Germany has 2 and a small village (almost a suburb) next to it has another. So you have 3 local breweries with about 4 sorts if beer each.

I'm simply repeating what Voltaire and Montesquieu said. Do you consider those philopsophers to be tabloids? 

&gt; The idea that Britain should pull out of an immensely important organ like the ECHR because of the prisoners votes issue is ludicrous, particularly when there is no concensus on the issue and you present no stance of your own.

There is a consensus on this issue. The UK parliament voted overwhelmingly on this. A tiny minority of MPs voted against the government.

&gt; Furthermore, the ECHR is going to pass legislation that conflicts with Parliament.

I'm not sure what you are talking about here, because the ECHR is not a legislative body so cannot pass legislation. I'm starting to think you do not really understand the fundamentals here?

&gt; The idea that you want people to believe you will take your ball and run home based on the voting issue alone is absurd and dismissable nonsense.

A good analogy would be the international courts. If a country,regardless of its geography and culture would not recognize the jurisdictions of the ICC and the ICJ, then yes, they are evading international accountability. 

&gt;In my mind it is exactly the point. Here the UK courts thought it was a fair trial, but not the ECHR. Why are you so happy with judgments coming from the ECHR but not with judgments coming from the UK courts? If the UK courts were right in this case (and in my view they were) nobody's ""rights"" were abused

We can either agree or disagree with the judgement in that case, but there are thousands of other cases where you may agree with the ECHR and disagree with the UK courts. 

Disagreeing with one case is as reasonable a motive to leave the jurisdiction of the ECHR as an individual giving up his citizenship because he disagrees with one law passed.

&gt;Really? Most countries in the world have their national courts being ultimate arbitres of human rights legislation. I'm happy for the UK to be one of those countries

Actually, the ultimate referee in term of human rights (as it's a very broad term) is somewhat shared between international bodies and national governments. One example that comes to mind is torture, a jus cogens norm. That's something that the ICJ deals with it, but not everyone recognizes its jurisdiction, and there's no sanction for it. That doesn't mean it's legal as international law is higher on the legal hierarchy than national law. You're simply not right with the statement that national courts have the final say.

Most developed countries have human right protections. On the other hand, there aren't many other countries that are well-off economically that do well on that issue.For example, Australia doesn't even have a Bill of Rights.It's a very grey area everywhere. However,I think that Europe is doing better than most especially due to the ECHR protection (not due to ECHR judgements necessarily,but due to the fact that there is another instance of appeal that gives individuals another chance)

It's a great check and balance and I cannot possibly imagine why would anyone think to do away with it.

1. Der Flugschreiber (den die Separatisten wohl bereits gefunden haben und der russischen Regierung übergeben wollen) wird unverändert begutachtet. Dann gibt es entweder

1.1. klare Hinweise auf einen technischen Defekt, der zu einem Auseinanderbrechen des Flugzeuges führen könnte (Piloten unterhalten sich über Warnmeldungen, ungewöhnliche Geräusche, Telemetrie ist 'off').

1.2. klare Hinweise auf einen Abschuß (Die Piloten sprechen über eine Rakete im Anflug oder über Kampfflugzeuge, die Kontakt aufnehmen wollen (die Separatisten haben den Ukrainern Abschuß per Kampfflugzeug vorgeworfen)). Verkehrsmaschinen haben in aller Regel kein Radar, das für Boden-Luft-Raketen-Konstellationen ausgelegt ist. 

1.3. Plötzliches Abbrechen aller Informationen - das könnte dann tatsächlich der Einschlag einer nicht erkannten Rakete sein - oder der Moment, in dem im Gepäckraum eine Bombe hochging, oder ein plötzlicher rapider Druckabfall auftrat, oder, oder, oder.

2. Der Flugschreiber wird in irgendeiner Weise manipuliert (und ja, das kann man nachweisen), bevor er der malaysischen Regierung und Boeing zurückgegeben wird. Dann ist das quasi wie ein Schuldeingeständnis. Etwas besseres kann Malaysia Airlines gar nicht passieren.

true,Aemilius_Paulus,RUSS,Russia,"&gt;They've been pouring gasoline on that fire for months now and they are the only reason that rebellion is still going on. Or that it has started in the first place.

There seems to be an international precedent for supplying rebels favourable to your cause, of course Russia would do that. I'm surprised they're limiting themselves in the scale of aid, so far it's been rather hard to prove any weapons were coming in from Russia in quantity as the rebels were making do with the millions of weapons they got from various caches, like that salt mine near Donetsk. However, now with the Grads and SAMs it is quite possible Russia is finally sending them some actual weapons, and the actual Russian gov't, not just a few Novorossiya-type extremists.  

&gt;Putin has been playing with fire (and human lives) for his little geopolitical and internal gains and that's what happens.

Putin is playing the same game everyone is. He's equally culpable, sure, but this is nothing new. Of course, when Russia does it, every Russian is literally Hitler, as many people seem to think here. But when US does it, I can't call it out because that's 'whataboutism'. No, this is realpolitik. 

&gt;EU appeasers also have this blood on their hands. Firm stance against Russian aggression 6 months ago could have prevented the escalation.

Hard to say. US just dipped into serious negative GDP growth. If the next quarter shows a negative growth as well, US will officially enter a second recession. Double dip. What *The Economist* has been crying about a while now. EU is reluctant to create serious sanctions because they're worried about their economy. With the economy as fragile as it is, even the smallest sanctions can have a ripple effect. 

Also, businesses are lobbying hard for no sanctions, they don't care if their money has blood on them. Perhaps if the EU wants to show they're better than US or Russia, they should step up and break free of the grip that large corporations have on their policymaking. But actual reforms and tough decisions that may possible lead to your gov't being voted out are *hard*. Easier to blame others. Kinda like Putin used this crisis to shift the blame away from anemic growth and distract the Russian populace with a classic misdirection through foreign conflict.

I'm not sure why ""areas"" should make any difference about rights? If rights can be specific to an ""area"", like Europe, why not also a nation?

&gt; We can either agree or disagree with the judgement in that case, but there are thousands of other cases where you may agree with the ECHR and disagree with the UK courts.  Disagreeing with one case is as reasonable a motive to leave the jurisdiction of the ECHR as an individual giving up his citizenship because he disagrees with one law passed.

I'm not saying it turns on a particular individual case. I just looked at one you yourself cited. My point is more that as a matter of principle, the ECHR should not be able to trump specific legislation enacted by the UK Parliament.

&gt; Actually, the ultimate referee in term of human rights (as it's a very broad term) is somewhat shared between international bodies and national governments. One example that comes to mind is torture, a jus cogens norm. That's something that the ICJ deals with it, but not everyone recognizes its jurisdiction, and there's no sanction for it. That doesn't mean it's legal as international law is higher on the legal hierarchy than national law. You're simply not right with the statement that national courts have the final say.

I'm not going to argue with this one, but different legal theorists have different views on this, as I am sure you know. My point is not about something like torture anyway.

&gt; Most developed countries have human right protections. On the other hand, there aren't many other countries that are well-off that do well on that issue.For example, Australia doesn't even have a Bill of Rights.

Australia's legal system is like the UK's. The concept of rights was originally one in which you had the right to do everything except the specific things that were illegal. That's not really a problem in my view. It doesn't mean that in practice rights are less well protected.

&gt;  However,I think that Europe is doing better than most especially due to the ECHR protection (not due to ECHR judgements necessarily,but due to the fact that there is another instance of appeal that gives individuals another chance)

La Crimée a voté 3 fois son indépendance de l'Ukraine en 20 ans d'existence. Voyant que l'Ukraine refusait d'accepter cela, ils se sont rattachés au pays plus puissant d'à côté qui acceptera de les défendre.

Le seul responsable de la Crimée, c'est l'Ukraine qui par 3 fois a refusé d'accorder son indépendance à la Crimée.

&gt;sauf que déstabiliser un pays déjà politiquement instable, ça donne une guerre civile à la frontière de son pays avec ce genre de conséquences.

C'était donc très malin de la part de l'UE d'aller foutre la merde là-bas. L'Ukraine est séparée en deux, comment croyait-on que ça allait finir, à financer les putschistes de la sorte ?

Maidan is FSB doing apparently.


I can't really provide links so stuff like spilno and all the other sites, that were live streaming during Euromaidan protests and what was shouted from the stage there by the likes of Lysenko and others. It was too long ago and i have no time or desire to dig up this shit, but i remember all the usual repetition of 2004 events. Same songs, different actors. 


When ""Right Sector"" was disobeying orders from Turchinov&amp;Co, they were instantly labeled as FSB project. It was funny and sad at the same time.


When Sashko Bilii was executed, first it was a special operation, then it was a suicide by 2 shots into heart, while he himself has removed his shirt (in case of vest).


When 40 people burned alive in Odessa, it was ""colorado bugs"", fuck em, russian provocators.


Have you read what your Yatsenyuk guy is saying all the time? Do you think officials should be accountable for the nonsense they spout? 


Do you remember comments like ""давайте пообещаем им все что нужно, а вешать будем потом""?


There is a simple matter of *common sense*, common sense suggests that propaganda exists and Ukraine is actively engaged in that field. This is like asking to prove why 2+2=4, you can and it might take quite some time, but there is small incentive to do so. 

Judging by our exchange, you convinced yourself that Ukraine is ""holy being and cannot into wrongdoing"", my experience says that everybody lies and follows their own agenda. Ukrainian goals require propaganda just as much as Russian side.

Why not? If farming is worth subsidizing, why does that change when the farms happen to lie in France? When we would start subsidizing windmills, the UK would have much more than other countries, given their coastline, and I don't see that as a problem either.

&gt;Do you want contribution if it is not in the interests of your country?

I should, if I said I want it as such. Now you should just say ""we'll do whatever we deem in the interest of the UK"".

Unsurprisingly countries who are oil exporters have a bargaining chip to shore up their sovereignty, but even Norway implements EU legislation, even without having a say in it. Switzerland even gave up significant parts of their banking secrecy.

But we had an obligation to help Libya when Gadaffi was oppressing his people, and that's lead to a borderline failed state where armed militias can hold the country to ransom. One of the main objectives in Afghanistan and Iraq was to improve the lives of the people living there. With ISIS advancing through Iraq and the Taliban breathing down the neck of a country which can hardly even hold elections, it's looking like we've failed on both counts. 

It's all well and good, high and mighty to say that we should 'help' but when that 'help' only sometimes leads to a country which is better off than before the 'help' then I think perhaps it would be better for *everyone* if people minded their own business. 

It's easy to say we should 'do something' and even that it is our duty to, but if we really take a long hard look in the mirror, maybe we'll realise that we should do the hard thing, which is let evil happen so that goodness can grow. The Ukrainians will find their own version of what is good. It's not for anybody else to tell them what good is. Hopefully, they'll decide that their idea of good looks a lot like ours, and that they'll join the EU so that we can all work towards that together, but that's a settlement Ukraine must come to alone.

It has caused some of the most wasteful and absurd projects in Belgium.

I'm not arguing for the UK getting more subsidies though. The UK should not get subsidies. I am just arguing for the UK not to contribute too much to current subsidies that France gets.

&gt; Subsidies are not allotted per country, they're allotted by farming activity. Farm more, then you'd get more subsidies too. 

The UK is half the size of France. It can't farm more without becoming much more inefficient.

&gt;This is why Putin is so popular, and this is why Russia is still a second world country.


A lot of people are displeased with Putin. The reason many people still support him is because he is better than what was before - the 90s was a hard time for Russia, due to the collapse of the USSR. Putin brought order and economic improvements along with corruption. Overall, he is a negative figure, but what would replace him? That's pretty much the reason for his support.

You don't even know what the term means. Sweden and Switzerland are third world countries. That is because they didn't pick a side during WW2. First world countries sided with the US, while second world with USSR. If Putin and friends were to be replaced with someone who is not corrupt as fuck, then improvements would follow. Corruption and abuse of power in the media, government, and pretty much daily life is the main reason for Russia being held back.

&gt; Je feinsinniger man ist, desto bessere Beziehungen führt man.

Even as a native speaker I failed finding a phrasing using the genitive case. So I have taken a look into my grammar book: It says the word 'man' only has a nominative singular case. For the dative and accusative case you need to use the respective form of 'einer'. 

Example:
&gt; *Man* nimmt sich nur, was *einem* zusteht. (You take only what you are entitled to)
&gt; Wenn *man* nicht aufpasst, blendet *einen* das Licht. (If you don't watch out, the light will blind you.)

However, about the genitive case of 'man' my book says nothing. I could rephrase your line with genitive case 'eines' but that would sound strange. We native speakers have many ways of avoiding the genitive case at all. Maybe this is why I've never missed a genitive substitute for 'man'. ;-)

Another interesting side note from my grammar book: The undefinite word 'man' always refers to persons but can have two meanings:

In a general sense it refers to everyone, all people. You can substitute them with German 'du' and translate to English 'you' because in both languages they also have an undefinite meaning:

&gt; *Man* lebt.../*Du* lebst nur einmal.
&gt; *You* life only once.

In a narrower sense 'man' refers to individual persons. You can substitute with German 'sie' or 'jemand' and translate to English 'they' or 'someone'

&gt; *They* have.../*Someone* has informed us.

From my perspective the biggest obstacles to peace are the rebels and the Ukrainian government. Not Russia, despite their annexation of Crimea. In fact, Russia could play an important role in a peace process.

However, at the moment Russia is doing nothing to stop the rebel activities. This is quite rational, why would they help the victory of a government they oppose? They would also loose a lot of face among the Russian population if they hunt down the separatists.

I do believe that Russia could be convinced in working towards peace. But if we negotiate with Russia, then we will loose face, because of all the effort we have put in condemning Russian agression. Another obstacle

Returning to the actual combatants. Here it is actually way too late for diplomacy. To anyone understanding the political climate it was clear from the day Yanukovich was overthrown that this could turn very ugly. Both sides acting as uncompromising as it gets. The annexation of Crimea was merely the sign to let loose the dogs of war. Added to that, Ukraine is winning at the moment. They are tasting complete victory and they will not be open for any kind of compromise or negotation.

With all these obstacles in mind, I can't say how this can be overcome but it would probably start with reaching out to Russia instead of alienating them. Because people believe this conflict is something that could not have happened without Russia pulling the strings. That is simply not true.

About the sanctions. The sanctions are part of geopolitical games being played that transcend this conflict. Let's assume for a second the sanctions work so well we practically have Russia by the balls and they agree to leave Crimea. What would happen then? Civil war in Crimea.

Du bist ja recht überzeugt von Deinem Standpunkt und möchtest den auch gern teilen.

Woran denkst Du, dass es liegt, dass es fast niemanden gibt, der den Konflikt objektiv erklären möchte und dass sich ziemlich viele Leute (natürlich) für eine Seite entschieden haben und, darüber hinaus, diese auch noch aktiv zu verbreiten suchen? Das ist mir etwa bei der Berichterstattung zum Nordirlandkonflikt, den ich lediglich als beliebiges Beispiel heranziehen möchte, so nicht aufgefallen. Da hat niemand versucht, mich auf seine Seite zu ziehen. Das erlebe ich hier anders, hier begegnet mir die persuasive Information noch vor der sachlichen. 

Als kleine Beobachtung am Rande möchte ich, noch immer ohne mich auf eine Seite geschlagen zu haben, noch anmerken, dass derzeit zB doch bei Reddit oder twitter ziemlich viel pro-Israel-Argumentation stattfindet. Anscheinend bewege ich mich hauptsächlich in den Kreisen, in denen sich „der dumme Mob“ nicht bewegt. Das freut mich natürlich, aber dann habe ich natürlich nur die teilweise schon etwas abschreckend aggressive Argumentation vor Augen, bei der ich fast die Angst habe, selbst in den Konflikt hineingezogen zu werden. Dazu beobachte ich auch noch, dass sich die meisten Argumente gleichen. Mir fällt dabei auf, dass oft auf die Frage „wieso wird da eine bewohnte Gegend bombardiert?“ zuerst die schlüssige Antwort kommt, dass es Taktik der Gegner sei, menschliche Schutzschilde zu verwenden, bevor selbst mit Raketen geschossen werde. Soweit, so nachvollziehbar. Vielleicht ist es natürlich entweder meine eigene Schwäche aus Mangel an Information oder die Schwäche derjeniger, die argumentieren, aber ein anderes Argument verstehe ich nicht: Weil Kinder entführt wurden. Das ist natürlich furchtbar, aber was hat das miteinander zu tun? Wieso werden dann Raketen geschossen? Vergeltung als Motiv scheint ja auszuscheiden, schließlich geht die ARgumentation oft weiter, in Israel würde den Verbrechern der Prozess gemacht. Dennoch tritt dieses Argument so oft auf, dass ich mich jetzt dran erinnere ;-). Meist sogar ähnlich formuliert. Generell ähnelt sich (beiderseits) die Argumentation in ihrer Formulierung, Aggression und Intensität. Gibt es irgendwo einen Argumentationsleitfaden oder wie muss man sich das vorstellen?

Meine Lage ist also nun die folgende: Ich kann mich weit und breit in augenscheinlich relativ neutralen Quellen wie Presse und Wikipedia informieren, um meinen eigenen Standpunkt zu bilden. Im Gespräch mit Leuten, so jetzt etwa wie mit Dir, finde ich allerdings nur wenig Erkenntnisse. Meist ist es nicht weit zu Überredung, Aufforderungen und Anschuldigungen. Das schreckt mich ehrlich gesagt, ganz unabhängig vom Inhalt der Argumentation, schon recht weit ab.

Also soviel zur Rückmeldung. Ich bin vom Thema jetzt eben wieder abgeschreckt. Ich werde mich selbst informieren aber in jedem Fall hüten, mich auf eine Seite ziehen zu lassen, denn mir ist die Gefahr zu groß, Propaganda aufzusitzen und mir Aggression und Hass (egal von welcher Seite im vorliegenden Fall) einreden zu lassen.

Mostly news media, which are biased and shameless (true in many other countries unfortunately). 

&gt; I actually agree, but I think the main factor here is because in Russia our equivalent of ""12 year old COD player banging your mum"" is the ""middleschool DOTA 2 player"".

You know, i now play multiplayer games for about 12 years in the internet. It might be a misinterpretation on my side, but i think every year it gets worse. To say it straightforward: I am aware of ""good"" Russians. I met some crazy, but lovely and very fun Russians out there. Nevertheless, it seems that every year, more and more Russians (also others) are ""flooding"" multiplayer games, rendering it way less teamplay oriented and often you'll see kyrillic chat spam and Russians, ilsulting others and refusing to speak English. And i even never played DOTA or LoL.

I feel a bit weird talking about games here, since it's a pretty serious topic. But multiplayer games are a enviroment, where many nationalities are coming together. Russians often (very often) just seem to be rude, simple and ignorant, while i seriously never had these unfortunate happenings with Norwegians, Canadians, Swiss, Spanish or Danish people etc. I could be wrong, that i admit. But it's my experience.

&gt; Ask people how they view British or German tourists. All three have negative reputation in their own ways.

All your comments are very much anti-EU, or at least you feel like the UK does not belong in the UK. You're a smart person. You consider that UK apart from the rest of Europe and that the UK should protect its interest.I suspect that if a Union/Federation would be the aim of the anglo-sphere you'd feel much different about that than the EU. As much as we'd pretend this to be an argument with an intelligent nature,it's still emotional on which side you happen to be on.

Actually I would be anti an anglosphere union. I think the UK should not limit itself to particular blocks but to have good relations with as much of the free, liberal and democratic parts of the world as possible. The UK should have very good relations with much of the anglosphere, though, partly because we share a language and also because in quite a few cases we even share a head of state.

&gt; Between the continent and the UK there is a very obvious distinction in terms of feeling european. Two different legal systems that are based on different values, different structures and different views on how society should function. It's really just a huge conflict that's illustrated in legal arguments,cultural,even economic.

I admit, your system seems weird to me but it has generally worked so far for you. Still, it seems to me that a system like that would be a lot easier to subvert than a fully written and codified one. Besides, it doesn't even have to be malice or anti-liberalism or whatever that hurts an individual's right, it can just as easily be bureaucratic inefficiency or stubbornness or an honest mistake and so on.

&gt; I'm not sure why the ECHR system would be better for individuals than the British Bill of Rights.

It's not an either/or situation, the point is to have both (which in a sense you already have). Like I said, it's better because it gives an additional avenue to pursue, in front of an even more independent body than a national court.

&gt; The balancing line between competing rights in my mind might find better expression at the national level, with the national parliament having final say.

Why?

&gt; I don't think the ECHR is really something that is connected to individuality.

The way I see it, the whole point of the ECHR is that the individual's human rights are more important than the state's sovereignty.

Le fait est que les institutions sont proaméricaines. Barroso en est l'exemple même. Juncker, en bon petit représentant d'un paradis fiscal contribue à cela et est dans la continuité.

&gt;l'europe n'est pas aux bottes des américains sur le plan géostratégique

Elle l'est. TAFTA et PISA, ça ne te suffit pas ? Les anciens de Goldman Sachs partout en Europe et à la BCE ça ne te suffit pas ? La CIA et l'espionnage généralisé sans AUCUNE sanction, ça ne te suffit pas ? Le manque total de volonté de concurrencer le dollar ? Je peux continuer des heures, les liens entre les fondateurs de l'Europe et la CIA, la trahison de l'Allemagne avec la défense européenne, le cheval de Troie britannique qui a empêché toute cohésion politique...

&gt;Quant à ce que ça va coûter à la russie. Entre la corruption et leur économie qui est trop dépendante aux ressources premières, ils ont bien plus besoin de l'accès au marché européen que nous de leur pétrole et gaz à moyen et long terme.

Déclaration idéologique.

L'accès au marché et le libre-échange ne sont pas la même chose. Lis un peu de Maurice Allais pour voir ce que fait le libre-échange quand on a des pays qui n'ont pas le même niveau de développement. La Russie est candidate à la confédération européenne, par contre, le mythe du libre-échange qui résout tout est faux.

Surprisingly when western Ukraine protested for months there were no armored cars, no artillery and even no same uniforms among the protesters. Even guns were extremally rare.

They build wooden catapult and used molotov coctails.

I wonder what makes the eastern Ukraine so much better supplied with armored cars, anti-tank missiles, etc, than the capital city?

And I wonder how do you explain somebody buying armored car and artillery with fuel, ammunition etc and waiting since nineties maintaining it perfectly and even painting it from time to time to use it now.

And that must have repeated a lot, because they have many of these.

Besides using medium and long-range surface-to-air rockets, or shooting artillery with any precision whatsoever isn't a thing that a regular person can do. You need military training in that particular domain.

Well, thats kind of nice to hear. Unfortunately this is either not a majority, or the media is not mentioning a anti-Putin-movement.

&gt; The reason many people still support him is because he is better than what was before - the 90s was a hard time for Russia [...]

Yes, i totally understand that. But the sme goes for former USSR states everywhere in east Europe and north Asia. As far as for the eastern European countries, they didn't spawn a toxic political enviroment (not sure for Ukraine and Belarus, though). More about that later.

&gt; You don't even know what the term means.

I do know what it means, and i admit that it was kind of a nasty choice of words. Just like the UN security council and the veto ability, the terms ""first world"" etc are relics from past times. But look at Poland and the Baltics for example. They were in nearly the same boat as Russia after 1990, but they made much more out of their possibilities. They developed healthy enviroments for politics and media, these are working democracies, whose found their ways into the EU, NATO and other international communities. 

Talking about Poland, as a German it makes me kinda happy to see that the Poles began to let the past be the past and look forward, just as we west Europeans did. This was a huge step forward for Poland and it's relationship with it's (western) neighboors. Now Poland is part of the political triangle ""France-Germany-Poland"", which works for cultural diplomacy in Europe for example.

Eh, i make my text longer than i should. Sorry for that. But looking at Russian these days, you'll get the strong feeling that it's looking into the past and making the same mistakes as 100 years before. Like the occupation of Crimea or the paid/forced (?) revolts in the eastern Ukraine. All the things that are happening in Russia (besides Ukraine) - laws against homosexual people - oppression of people not agreeing with Putins mind - hunt for international reporters - extremism - populism. They really sound freightening and concerning. And since there no few to no media cover at all about protest movements (you tell me if these exist) from Russians against these things, the view at Russia is of course affected.

Bezler: ""Just downed a plane. ""Miner"" group. It has fallen behind Enakievo.

Geranin: ""Pilots? Where are the pilots?""

Bezler: ""Went to look for them and photo the downed plane. It's smoking...""

Geranin: ""How many minutes ago?""

Bezler: ""Approximately 30 minutes ago""

Subtites: After examining the plane terrorists have concluded they've downed the civilian aircraft.

""Greek"" (apparently a nickname): ""Yes, major!""

""Major"" (same here): ""Allright. So the ""chernuhinskie"" have downed the plane. From Chernuhinskiy check point. Cosacs that are located at Chernuhino. The plane has colapsed in the air, around the Petropavlovsk mine. We found the first ""two hundred"" (dead person in Russian millitary communication ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_200))). It's a civilian""

After a moment:

Greek: ""What's going on there?""

Major: ""In short, [shit], its 100% a civilian plane.""

Greek: ""[Fuck] are there a lot of people?""

Major: ""Fucking shit. The parts have fallen right in the backyards.""

Greek: ""What kind of plane?""

Major: ""I haven't figured out yet. I haven't been to the main part. I am only looking where the first bodies started to fall. There are the remainders of inside connections, seats, bodies.""

Greek: ""Understood. Any weaponry?""

Major: ""Nothing at all. Civilian belongings, medical remainders, towels, toilet paper.""

Greek: ""Any documents?""

Major: ""Yes. Of Indonesian student. From Thompson University.""

Next call:

Terrorist: ""About the plane, downed around Snizhne - Torez. It came out to be a passenger plane. It has collapsed near Grabovo, there is a sea of dead bodies, women and children.

true,-THE_BIG_BOSS-,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I think the problem with many Russians' views is not due to them being Russian it's the media in Russia. Yes. Media in Russia is completely corrupt and shit. Since most Russians get their news from Russian TV or Russian internet, they are predominantly exposed to the corrupt, state-owned media. A few months ago, the only independent major news source - lenta.ru - was bought by a state media company and a third of people working there were fired immediately and replaced.


I have no doubts about the multiplayer gaming part. I've no idea why it's so, but being Russian myself, I think I can say it links to the country's situation as a whole. More and more Russians are playing games since there's improvements to the internet connection and game accessibility. When I left the country in 2008, in my area I didn't know a single person who had an Xbox 360 or PS3 or whatever (the situation was very likely different in Moscow or St. Petersburg though, them being rich and developed). Throughout the early/mid decade, everyone who played games, played illegal copies of stuff like CS 1.6 or Warcraft 3 (for the mods such as DOTA). Life in the country (including economical) is improving - between 2011 and 2013, Russia has jumped 11 places to 55th on the [Human Development Index.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index#High_human_development) This is why, I believe, more Russians are now playing games.


As to why they refuse to speak English, I think its mainly due to them playing with friends and communicating with them, as inconsiderate for others that might be in the game. You won't see much hospitality towards strangers in Russia anyway. Throughout USSR/Russia's history, the circles of friends were kept small, where everyone was trusted and welcomed. Although I don't think this is relevant, but just to throw something out there.


&gt;Russians often (very often) just seem to be rude, simple and ignorant, while i seriously never had these unfortunate happenings with Norwegians, Canadians, Swiss, Spanish or Danish people etc. I could be wrong, that i admit. But it's my experience.


My experience as well from time to time. The ""simple and ignorant"" could come from being misled by the media. Rudeness, especially intolerance (racism and homophobia in particular) comes from the country being culturally behind Norway, Canada, Switzerland, Spain, Denmark, etc. by 20-30 years. Edit - 40 years, rather. I'm not sure about Russian mentality or anything, but take gay rights protests which are quickly dispersed by police force in Moscow or something. Being from socially and economically developed countries, our views are likely to be ""that's horrible, the police shouldn't be allowed to use force like that"" but even an educated Russian's opinion would probably be ""lol, why do they keep making protests if they know they're gonna get beated up?""",0,1405628893,null,0,1405631009,0,cj0abb1,t3_2aykf8,t1_cj0abb1,t1_cj09a6n,null,1434766120,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Yahoo operates in France and as such is subject to French law, plus its nazi stuff is accessible from France. So they can't sell nazi stuff in France. Now this is impossible without stopping to sell Nazi stuff entirely, but that is not the judge's problem.

If Dassault systems, say, distributed for free some piece of software protected by a software patent, a US court could ask them to remove it from the Internet and that would be perfectly understandable, though questionable. Questionable decisions by US courts or agencies regarding foreign parties have actually happened lots of times (the recent BNP fine, the cases against lots of Swiss bank employees, the various cases against the SNCF and many more).

(I agree that all this is dubious. Yahoo should have appealed in France and not in the US ; I think they'd have been cleared of charges. Still, is not more than questionable. It makes sense.)

Edit : I'll add that a reason the US court of Appeals upheld the ruling was that the LICRA and the UEJF didn't try to have in enforced (in court) in the US, so US courts weren't competent. The only reason it was enforced in the US was technicalities out of any court's control.",0,1405629208,null,0,1405630781,0,cj0ahj7,t3_2ay383,t1_cj0ahj7,t1_cj09pj8,null,1434766140,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Mevarit,native-edit,native (Hochdeutsch),"*Hans im Glück* ist ein von den aus Deutschland stammenden Gebrüdern Grimm veröffentlichtes Märchen aus dem Jahre 1812.

Es handelt sich um eine besondere Geschichte, weil es ein ziemlich bescheidenes Thema behandelte und nicht so fanatisch ist, wie andere Märchen jener Zeit. Nichtsdestotrotz blieb die Moral über die Jahre erhalten und ist für sich recht transzendent (I don't get it) - je mehr Besitztümer du hast desto größer sind deine Lasten zu tragen.

Es endet mit dem Verlust des Vermögens für den Protagonisten, der daraufhin ""frei von seinen Sorgen"" ist, allerdings am Leben festhält und es ihm ermöglicht seine kranke Mutter zu besuchen.

In der ursprünglichen Geschichte arbeitete Hans sieben Jahre für seinen Meister, als er mit seiner Arbeit fertig ist, möchte er nach Hause gehen, zu seiner Mutter. Sein Lohn ist ein großer Klumpen Gold, dieser wiegt allerdings so viel, dass er das Gold glücklich gegen ein Pferd eintauscht. Das Pferd, wie dem auch sei, lässt sich schwer zügeln und er fällt herunter, also tauscht er es gegen eine Kuh ein, welches zum Trost Milch, Butter und Käse liefert. Leider ist die Kuh alt und kann keine Milch mehr produzieren, also tauscht er es gegen ein Schwein ein, wohl wissend, dass es gutes Fleisch liefert. Doch jemand erzählt ihm, Leute würden Schweine stehlen, also tauscht er sein Schwein für eine Gans ein, reich an Fleisch und Fett. Wie zuvor konnte Hans sich nicht glücklicher schätzen. Als ein Mann ihm erzählt, es wäre ihm möglich als Schleifer ein gutes Leben zu verbringen, tauscht er die Gans gegen einen Schleifstein ein. Er hält anschließend an einem Fluss inne um zu trinken, jedoch fällt der Stein auf den Grund und Hans steht fröhlich auf und ruft: ""Wie glücklich ich bin, noch nie war ein Sterblicher so glücklich wie ich es bin."" (the original: „So glücklich wie ich‚ gibt es keinen Menschen unter der Sonne""). Er steht auf, befreit von seinen Problemen und reist zum Hause seiner Mutter.

Die Geschichte knüpft an englische Sprichtwörter wie ""Geld kann keine Glückseligkeit kaufen"" und ""Die besten Dinge im leben sind kostenlos"" an.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; Still, it seems to me that a system like that would be a lot easier to subvert than a fully written and codified one. Besides, it doesn't even have to be malice or anti-liberalism or whatever that hurts an individual's right, it can just as easily be bureaucratic inefficiency or stubbornness or an honest mistake and so on.

In my mind these are theoretical risks which don't seem to have occurred. I am reminded of that joke about French functionaires who say things like: ""I know it works in practice, but does it work in theory?"" In Britain if it works in practice we don't think about the theory.

&gt; It's not an either/or situation, the point is to have both (which in a sense you already have). Like I said, it's better because it gives an additional avenue to pursue, in front of an even more independent body than a national court.

I think that national courts can be completely independent and I would say that the UK courts are. Indeed, if we start to say that national courts are not independet, we are challenging a foundation of democracy and the rule of law. Provided that the UK has three levels of judicial appeal, I think that a fourth appeal, to the ECHR should not be necessary. 

I don't think two systems are better than one. Why not three systems? Or 20? The ideal is to have one good system in my mind.

&gt; the UK national courts already failed at applying the ECHR in those cases (again, unless you believe the European Court is on some kind of crusade to make British courts look bad or something).

I will have a look at this and the cases. However, I am not sure if a difference in opinion between the UK courts and the ECHR is the same as saying that the UK courts failed. Why should the ECHR be better at applying the law than the UK courts? I find the proposition that you hold, that when the UK courts and the ECHR disagree that it is the UK courts who have failed somewhat strange. Why not take the alternative view, that the ECHR has failed? Why is one body of judges better at interpreting the law than another?",0,1405629296,null,0,false,0,cj0aj9c,t3_2aybcr,t1_cj0aj9c,t1_cj09uqk,null,1434766146,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

true,jeff_goldblum_rrrrrr,EURO,Federalism 5eva,"Well, we don't know that for certain. To my mind, there are three probable possibilities and two improbable ones:

a) **The Donetsk rebels acquired an air defence system and people trained to use it.** The BUK system is [very complex](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:9%D0%9039_TEL_interior.JPG#mediaviewer/File:9%D0%9039_TEL_interior.JPG) and requires several highly trained crew members, including a radar operator. It's not something you can learn in a weekend. Maybe the crew defected/surrendered with the equipment, or some retired operators are helping out.

b) **The Russians supplied the ADS and/or people trained to use it.** It is well documented that the Russians have been sending equipment and soldiers across the border. BUK is a pretty big system and NATO would probably have noticed if it moved. However, if the system was acquired a few weeks ago, Russia could have sent a crew to operate the equipment in that time.

c)**The missile that downed the plane came from within Russia's borders.** Either another BUK launcher or a permanent SAM installation wouldn't have a problem attacking the aircraft (more modern versions of BUK can hit an aircraft from 30 miles, whilst the more powerful [S-300]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-300_(missile) ) can hit up to 200 miles) However, these air defence systems would presumably be working in co-ordination with Russian air traffic control, so they'd know which flights were Ukranian military and which weren't. 

There may have been a communication breakdown between ATC and the military, as happened with MH-370, but if both services were doing their job, they'd know not to target the flight. It's also possible that the flight had deviated off course by a margin, which would make the above cock-up more likely.


Improbable:

d) **The Ukranian military shot it down.** The 777 was flying away from Donetsk when it was hit, so the Ukranian's wouldn't have much reason to strike it. Ukranian military radar and air traffic control would presumably be working together, so they should have been aware of civilian flights. Russia has yet to conduct military air missions in Ukranian airspace, so a suspected hostile Russian plane would be a big deal. The chain of command, and the media would have been notified of an incursion. They'd also try and [IFF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_friend_or_foe) before firing unless they were complete idiots.

This said, all it takes is a nervy Captain to give an order, and things can go wrong pretty quickly.

e) **The plane crashed due to mechanical failure or pilot error.** Mechanical failure is very rare on modern aircraft, and it would have to have been catastrophic to bring the plane crashing down so quickly. Pilot error would have to be incredibly significant as there were no adverse weather conditions.

However, until we have evidence, any of these scenarios could have happened. I think the top 3 are most likely, and of those three, the separatists acting with limited Russian help is most convincing. Russian ATC would have seriously fucked up if this was the Russians acting alone. It seems more likely that this was carried out by people with no means of IFF and no knowledge of the air traffic - those people being the rebels.

&gt; Well, take the front page right now, for example. 6 posts are about visiting the city/tourism. They're pretty much all downvoted, and they point the user to the search bar.

What this says is that there are so few posts in /r/Paris that posts with negative scores are making it to the front page. The problem is not these posts, the problem is a lack of more interesting material. If there were more traffic, these wouldn't be seen on the front page and people willing to help tourists could do so on the New tab.

Directing tourism questions to sticky threads does not seem like a good idea to me, especially because it will make it very hard to search for info in old posts (because hits will be full of irrelevant discussion about other stuff).

Some subreddits have styling that pop up a warning when you move the mouse over the Submit buttons, e.g. ""You must read the Rules and FAQ before posting"". (see e.g. /r/Seattle) Maybe that would help to cut down repeat questions?

More importantly, the sidebar is mostly in French. That means most tourists, who don't know much French, won't understand it and it wont deter them from posting. I recommend revising the sidebar to start with clear links in English to the FAQ.

Recently many recurring questions have been about finding a short-term apartment. It is not in the wiki. Improving the wiki may be a better way to cut down these posts than trying to force them into a sticky thread.

TL;DR: I recommend making some constructive changes to deter the recurring posts rather than implementing the rule that certain posts are not welcome at all.

It actually angers me because it comes across as a bit arrogant.

Our unemployment rate is high, there are a lot of people fresh off university with a master degree or a doctorate, their mother language is German and even they can't find a job. Interviewing for a job is hard enough without the language barrier, and there's no way someone would accommodate to your needs by doing the interview in English (if you'd ever get that far in first place).

I can't even see you teaching German people your language since you'd somehow have to communicate with them in the beginning in German, too, in order to teach them something. 

So yeah, I'm quite at a loss at what to tell you, especially since I don't even know what your mother language is. Since you have bar experience, maybe you could be a waiter at a restaurant that serves the food of your country? That's actually the only thing that comes to my mind right now.

I don't know what you have seen. There was no flight plan on that particular link. See the image in my message for the flight plan.

&gt;  I mean, who would have thought they would fly over Donetsk when a SU-26 was just shot down yesterday, along with two cargo and one more jet fighter planes?

I don't know. Is this a serious question or just a play on rhetorics? Because I'm not interested in playing such games. IMO the relevant question is who the hell aims and shoots a civilian aircraft cruising at high altitude on its route and then boasts about it.

&gt; I'm not sure I understand your second statement though, can you elaborate?  Why wouldn't the airspace be closed or at least advised against flying over if the rebels have MANPADs and now large truck-based SAMs?

There was a relevant NOTAM issued at 00:00z or about 10hrs before Malaysian 17 departure. However, it concerned the routes up to FL320. Malaysian 17 flew higher at FL330. And because the route is essentially on the grand circle between Europe and SE Asia it is very popular among airlines. There were numerous other civilian airliners on that route at high altitude today such as Singapore Airlines SQ351 and Air India AI113. Here they are [flying near the Malaysian 17 when it disappeared](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BsxF_J_CcAAycNi.png:large).

Because i often hear about Russians (mostly Russians from the intelligent class, so to say) leaving their home country because they feel not safe or comfortable anymore.


I live in England now. Spent most of my life in Russia in Astrakhan, if you want to take a look at the city. I emigrated in 2008 - when I was 10, so it's more my parents' doings, for which I'll be grateful for the rest of my life. Kinda lucked my way into a developed country, hmm? The main reason for moving is basically a better, easier life for me. As you can see, Russia (along with most of the world) lags behind on many things behind places such as UK. [OECD Better Life Index](http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/), [Human Development Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index) for reference, but to sum it up, life - is - simply easier and better. Some effects are immediate to notice, e.g. the fact that tap water is drinkable, others take time - culture, life satisfaction, health/life expectancy, wealth, people's morals and values, whatever.

- Ich hab nicht gemerkt, dass meine Hose offen ist! - Das muss dir **doch** auffallen!

""mal"", often used as a filler, doesn't really translate
- Kannst du mir **mal** kurz helfen?
- Ich geh jetzt **mal** nach Hause!
- Ich muss **mal** aufs Klo.

""jetzt"" - often added to sentences, not really necessary for meaning:
- Muss das **jetzt** sein?
- Du kannst **jetzt** mal ruhig sein.
- Willst du **jetzt** mitkommen oder nicht?
- Das ist **jetzt** mal eine gute Idee! (See how I used ""mal"" from above again?)

vielleicht - used to put emphasis on something that's kinda like an exclamation:
- Du bist **vielleicht** lustig! (doesn't mean 'maybe' in this context, but rather 'really')
- Das war **vielleicht** ein steiler Berg! 
- Ich bin **vielleicht** müde heute! 

Similarly, you can use ""echt"" for emphasis which really is like 'really':
- Das war **echt** nett von dir!
- Ich will jetzt **echt** nach Hause gehen. 

Use ""sau"" before adjectives when talking to younger people to make them stronger:
- Das war sau lustig!
- Der Kaffee war **sau** teuer.
- Meine Deutschlehrerin ist **sau** streng.
- Die Prüfung war **sau** schwer.

You really think the government never wronged someone due to bureaucratic inefficiency or stubbornness or an honest mistake? That long list of cases would indicate otherwise.

&gt; I think that national courts can be completely independent and I would say that the UK courts are. Indeed, if we start to say that national courts are not independet, we are challenging a foundation of democracy and the rule of law.

Well, I think that's naive. Certainly, broadly speaking modern national courts are independent but I think it's an illusion that they are *completely* independent. Besides, that's short term thinking. Who says the independence of the courts can't be compromised in the future? The ECHR is an independent safeguard against that.

&gt; I don't think two systems are better than one. Why not three systems? Or 20?

Because the point is just to have a tool that is independent from your national apparatus. One additional system is enough for that. What qualitative value would further systems add?

&gt; However, I am not sure if a difference in opinion between the UK courts and the ECHR is the same as saying that the UK courts failed. Why should the ECHR be better at applying the law than the UK courts? 

Well, purely personally, in the majority of cases I've read about, I tend to agree with the ECHR's reasoning and the Court generally doesn't punish the states without strong reasons. Of course, there is no truly objective way to determine which court is better and some cases can be viewed as a mere difference of opinion (but some cannot, that last case seems at least after a quick glance, like blatant religious discrimination). At the risk of repeating myself, in such a situation I view the increased removal of the ECHR from national systems as a sufficient reason to prefer it. And since ECHR cases only involve an individual complaining against a state (and not an individual complaining against another individual or the state complaining against an individual), I'd rather err on the side of giving people more means to protect themselves.",0,1405632473,null,0,false,0,cj0c8gi,t3_2aybcr,t1_cj0c8gi,t1_cj0aj9c,null,1434767026,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

""All the times I've gotten laid, they were one night stands. A few times, I felt things were going too fast, and maybe she would not appreciate it, so I backed down. I never heard from them again.""

Someone has told me that it's also unusual for German girls in this part of the country (northwest area, Niedersachsen in general) to date foreigners, and if they would, people would talk. Not necessarily a bad thing, but they'd talk. i.e, her friends.

We all learn many things that are not necessary always correct. It is not an excuse to perpetuate something just because we have learned it as children once we know what the better way of doing something is.

Also, as previously said, there's nothing wrong (in my mind) with calling out problems within certain cultures. And god knows I don't even necessarily disagree with some of what I think you were trying to say. 

It is the way you did it that I strongly objected to. The way we phrase things shapes the way we think, the way other people around us think. It isn't something to be taken lightly. There are ways of phrasing criticism and opinion that does set people against each other, that does not encourage hate and reduces whole nations and cultures to a few bad stereotypes. There's nothing wrong with voicing your opinion, just be mindful of the way you do it.

Also, while I am open to being with someone I did not initially consider attractive at first sight and instead, had an emotional connection with (I've done it before) first, it is not very practical.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I can agree with most of what you say but I vehemently disagree with regard to the necessity of Russian involvement for creating this conflict. None of this would have happened if the Russian regime would have focussed on improving Russia instead of trying to maintain or re-claim a ""sphere of influence"" that they supposedly deserve.

I'm going to generalize a lot here;

You say that because you don't understand Ukraine. Which is absolutely normal since it is not a reasonable place. We think Ukraine is a country like ours, yearning to escape the iron grip of the Russian bear. It's nothing like that. It has been a mere 20 years since Ukraine has been something else than Russia for the first time in its existence. So today the process of nation building is advancing in full throttle but not everyone agrees with the direction it's going in. In fact the population is very divided.

Second, the Russian regime is a paragon of stability and virtue compared to Ukrainian politics. If you're looking for a term to describe Ukrainian politics I would suggest 'Gogolian'. The word 'compromise' doesn't exist in Ukrainian politics. Now, combine this with a population not only divided on the question what trade bloc to join but on the question what they actually are and you get an extremely hostile climate, as proven by several parliamentary brawls.

My conclusion is that Ukraine never needed Russia to render it into chaos. I'm not saying Russia played no role in this, I mean after Crimea they obviously carry part of the responsibility. But they could not have created this simply because the essence of this conflict is uniquely Ukrainian. All the opposing factions, the ideologies, the disagreements, the hard-line attitudes have been in the making for more than a decade. And in the end the reasonable elements (the citizens in Kiev peacefully protesting for reforms but also the citizens of Russian ethnicity who were worried and wished for more autonomy) have lost from the uncompromising radicals on both sides.

&gt;Personally, I am now willing to pay significantly higher prices if that would allow us to completely isolate Russia. The economy broke the USSR, it will break the new regime as well.

Breaking the USSR brought years of misery over a population that did not deserve this. It didn't change much for good, the next couple of years they got an incompetent in power who forged elections and after that they got an authoritarian in power (the current one) who is claimed to do the same. ""Breaking the regime"" would be a significant humanitarian catastrophy. And who is waiting to jump on the opportunity of that power vacuum? I'll let you know that the communist party is the second largest, followed by ultra-liberals and mystical conservative nutjobs (these are the ones yelling for Putin to reclaim ""New Russia"" in Ukraine). And that's just the political side, there's also the well known selection of criminals, oligarchs in making, separatists and extremists. Really, how does wishing such a thing make us any more civil?

Nothing good or worthwile will come of such a catastrophy. For the EU, the Putin regime is workable, predictable, and stable. This is what Europe needs, not some huge nation in chaos.

Maybe I'm too forgiving for Russia, but I'm not some pro Russian troll. What counts for me is peace and the interests of Europe. And I think this is only possible when we find some kind of modus vivendi with Russia.

Heutzutage lese ich viel (ich versuche jeden Tag rund fünfzig Seiten zu lesen) und obwohl ich versuche, viele Genres zu lesen, die Arten von Büchern die ich am häufigsten lese sind Sachliteratur, einschließlich Wissenschaftsbücher, Bücher über Volkswirtschaft und Bücher über Linguistik und einige Arten von Fiktion wie fantastische Literatur und Sciencefiction .

&gt;
Als du jünger warst, was waren deine Hobbys?

&gt;Als ich jünger war, mochte ich viel, das ich jetzt nicht mehr mag, wie etwa Fußball, den ich fast jeden Tag spielte und jetzt nie treibe (hier nicht ideal), Federball, den ich jetzt nur ganz gelegentlich treibe und Kricket, wovon ich besessen war. Ich spiele weniger Sport heutzutage, teils, weil ich es in der Schule nicht *treibe* (da ich “Fast-Track Spanisch mache) und auch weil ich mich dafür viel weniger interessiere (vielleicht weil Ich von fast allen meinen Sportlehrern einen Schwächling genannt wurde (moderner)). Es ist möglich, dass ich mehr Sport in der Zukunft treiben werde, um ein Bisschen gesünder zu werden.

&gt;
Wenn du mehr Zeit und Geld zur Hand hättest, was würdest du machen?

&gt;Wenn ich mehr Zeit und Geld zur Hand hätte, würde mein Leben ganz anders sein, zum Beispiel würde ich mehr lesen, da ich relativ wenig gelesen habe sogar im Vergleich zur Anzahl der Bücher in meinem Haus. Zusätzlich würde ich ein europaweites (oder weltweites) Immobilienimperium aufbauen, so dass ich später nicht würde arbeiten müssen (und um die Welt zu regieren). Wenn ich eine Menge Geld hätte, würde ich eine mittelgroße Insel vor der Küste von Finnland kaufen (oder mit meiner Privatarmee eindringen), wo ich meine bösen Missionen planen würde. 

&gt;
 Wie lange könntest du ohne Technologie leben?

&gt;An einem normalem Tag benutze ich eine Vielzahl von  Technologien, wie z.b. mein Handy, einen Computer (zu Hause oder in der Schule) und mein Tablett, also würde man denken, dass ich es ziemlich schwer finden würde, ohne Technologie zu leben, aber tatsächlich könnte nichts der Wahrheit weniger entsprechen. Obwohl ich Technologie jeden Tag und sehr gern benutze, kann ich auf sie sehr einfach verzichten. Es würde definitiv sehr unbequem sein, weil ich, wie ich schon gesagt habe, viel Technologie benutze und weil sie mein Leben verbessert, aber gleichwohl glaube ich, dass ich mindestens ein paar Monate ohne Technologie leben könnte. 

&gt;
Was sind die Nachteile der modernen Technologie?

&gt;Meiner Meinung nach hat moderne Technologie nicht so viele Nachteile wie Vorteile, aber ich muss zugeben, dass sie ein paar Probleme verursachen kann. Diese könnten Faulheit, Abhängigkeit und (möglicherweise )  Fettleibigkeit einschließen, aber wirklich bin ich nicht sicher, ob moderne Technologie diese Probleme verursacht -  ich denke, dass die Probleme ein Teil der menschlichen Natur sind und dass die Technologie nur hilft, diese schlechten Gewohnheiten herauszubilden.

true,durandaI,,Expatrié,"All good points. I am actually currently in the process of making a website that I can redirect users to for their most important questions (non-profit, of course. There will never, ever, ever, be an ad on  redditparis.com). 

I think that's the easiest avenue to address the wiki problem. Most users ignore the wiki, but If I reply to users who I redirect to the open thread with a link to the website, I think that will be good enough.

My current plans for the website are to include two guides (based on the most upvoted reddit posts) to moving to and visiting Paris. I will further include subsections on short visits and long visits. I will also include a guide to short stay and long stay. 

Fuck you, durandaI, you say. You're just taking user contributions and want to make money off them. No, no I don't give a shit about that.

 I'm on vacation and I need a side project, and domain hosting costs nothing, so this can be my side project. I will direct users to the open thread so that other users can participate in discussion, however I think this website I am creating will solve most problems. Plus, I'm a freelance marketing consultant, I've got time to e-mail people about this shit if they have further questions.

&gt;More importantly, the sidebar is mostly in French. That means most tourists, who don't know much French, won't understand it and it wont deter them from posting. I recommend revising the sidebar to start with clear links in English to the FAQ.

Excellent point that I had not considered. Could you elaborate on this a bit? Your ideas, etcetera?


&gt;TL;DR: I recommend making some constructive changes to deter the recurring posts rather than implementing the rule that certain posts are not welcome at all.


Noted. But I think the website I am creating and the changes I am making will be good.

The basic UI for the website is this:

It's a choose your own adventure style site. The splash page asks ""Are you a tourist?"" and ""Are you moving to Paris?"" as well as "" I have a more specific question.""

If you choose tourist, it goes to this:

""Are you staying less than a week?"" or  ""Are you staying more than a week?""

* ""Are you staying less than a week?"" page

""Is it a special occasion?""  or ""Is it a quick vacation?""

""Special occasion"" redirects to a page with all the special occasion info, ""Quick vacation"" redirects to all the quick vacation info. 

* More than a week page

 redirects you to general paris info

If you choose 'moving to Paris', it goes to this:

* 'Are you staying less than three months?' or 'Are you staying more than three months' 

If you choose less than three months, it goes to a recommendation page for less than three month stays, the same for more than three months.

If you choose 'I have a more specific question'

* You get directed to a FAQ, with popular posts

The pages themselves will be brief summaries, along with links to third party sites as well as links back here. In the future, I plan to open it up to more people than just me. I plan on having all this done sometime in August.

----


The reason  I want to make a website is people trust outside links more than they trust wikis that are hosted on reddit. Plus, It gives me a project to do on vacation, and, I'm sorry, but I'm an American, [I don't know what to do with all this vacation time.](https://i.imgur.com/WCPwlJt.jpg)

true,balanceofpain,null,null,"&gt; Weil Kinder entführt wurden. Das ist natürlich furchtbar, aber was hat das miteinander zu tun? Wieso werden dann Raketen geschossen? 

Die Entscheidung der israelischen Regierung, auf die Entführung und Ermordung der drei Schüler mit Angriffen auf die Hamas im Westjordanland und schließlich Gaza zu reagieren, mag befremden, aber sie hat einen gewissen Sinn im Westfälischen Staatensystem.  Dieser liegt darin, dass die Ermordung der Schüler zu einer Reaktion nötigte, wenn man nicht an Reputation einbüßen wollte.  Dabei spielte es keine Rolle, ob die Entführer auf eigenes Kommando agierten.  Die bloße Tatsache, dass sie Verbindungen zur Hamas hatten, war ausreichend, die israelische Regierung unter Zugzwang zu setzen.  Hätte sie nichts getan, hätte es so ausgesehen, als ob man Israel ungestraft ans Bein pinkeln kann.  Weiter muss erwähnt werden, dass die Verdächtigen der Entführung und Tötung m.W.n. nach wie vor auf der Flucht sind, Hamas also nicht fähig oder willens war, sie festzusetzen.  Dieser Umstand macht aus einem Verbrechen, das in den Zuständigkeitsbereich der Polizei fällt, einen Kriegsakt. Für Netanjahu wäre Stillhalten gleichsam das politische Aus gewesen (darin ähnelt der Konflikt dem Anlass für den Afghanistan-Krieg: auch hier lieferte eine Regierung einen Straftäter nicht aus und provozierte dadurch Krieg). Also reagierte er mit Festnahmen und Durchsuchungen, die Palästinenser entsprechend mit Protesten, wobei es zu Gewalt und Toten kam.

Dies setzte im Gegenzug die Hamas-Führung unter Druck. Auch sie musste nun Stärke zeigen, um bei den Anhängern das Gesicht zu wahren. Dies kann sie aber nur durch Raketenangriffe, welche Kriegsverbrechen sind, da sie mangels Wirksamkeit nicht das Prinzip der militärischen Notwendigkeit erfüllen, mangels Steuerbarkeit gegen das Unterscheidungsgebot verstoßen und durch Stationierung in Wohngebieten Opfer unter der eigenen Zivilbevölkerung provozieren.  Die Israelis mussten im Gegenzug miteskalieren.  Dass die Zahl der Opfer sich im unteren dreistelligen Bereich bewegt, ist einzig der Zurückhaltung und Vorsichtigkeit der Israelis bei der Zielauswahl geschuldet.  Wenn die wollten, wie sie könnten, läge die Zahl der Totem im sechsstelligen Bereich.  Trotzdem faseln Wirrköpfe von Genozid daher.  Dieser Unterschied ist der Grund dafür, dass die Palästinenser, die durch ihr Stillhalten die Hamas-Regierung de facto legitimieren, weder Unterstützung noch Sympathie noch Neutralität verdienen.  Wenn also auf Anti-Israel-Demonstrationen »Free Gaza!« geschrien wird, kann die Antwort nur lauten: »From Hamas!« Der Konflikt wird erst wieder abebben, wenn eine Verständigung gefunden wird, bei der beide Seiten ihr Gesicht wahren können.

Solange sich der Hass der Palästinenser ob der Israelischen Angriffe gegen Israel statt gegen die Hamas, wo er hingehört, richtet, haben sie ebenso wenig das Recht, sich über ihre toten Kinder zu beschweren, wie die Deutschen unter Hitler.  Wer hier argumentiert, dass man von den Palästinensern nicht allen Ernstes erwarten könne, angesichts ihrer desolaten Situation besonnen und rational zu denken und zu handeln, entmündigt sie kollektiv. Dass im Gaza-Streifen allerdings noch radikalere Elemente Zulauf bekommen, stimmt mich nicht froh.

&gt; denn mir ist die Gefahr zu groß, Propaganda aufzusitzen und mir Aggression und Hass

Nur weil ein Argument zur Propaganda gebraucht oder nicht gebraucht wird, wird es dadurch nicht weniger falsch oder wahr.

Instead of saying:

&gt;Russians are being raised that if there's a problem, the stronger guy wins the argument. They have no knowledge of discussions, they don't even think about finding solutions like that.

you could say:

“One of the problems still often encountered in the Russian culture is that strength, rather than a rational quite discussion is the best way to solve a problem. The ""mighty Russia"" mentality still prevails among many people, with many considering Putin as the Czar or Russia, the strong hand that is needed. This needs to change is order for Russia to come closer to European ideals of human rights. “

I might still be using generalisations here, but it is no where near as offensive and vast as that of Kefeng.

* The decision does not make a ""crime"" of anything. This was not a criminal justice case, but a civil case.
* The restaurant didn't sue the blogger for libel, hate speech or defamation. It sued her for ""denigration"", a figure of French *commercial* law which is typically found in unfair competition cases where somebody deliberately set out to harm a competitor's business with false, negative and misleading publicity.
* I don't think the judge ruled against her *because* of the Google ranking. However, the judge *must* have taken the Google ranking into consideration when assessing the damage: a basic principle of French civil law is that compensation must be commensurate to the damage caused, and the damage caused by the post must certainly be bigger with a high Google ranking, regardless of whether the blogger did anything to get that ranking or not.
* Finally, and most importantly, the blogger made the fundamental  mistake of not hiring a lawyer. As the saying goes: ""who represents himself has a fool for a client"". This was particularly stupid since French civil law has a strict ""loser pays"" rule that means that the blogger could have had the restaurant pay her legal costs.

Why do you think that the UK was so instrumental in creating the ECHR in the first place? Is your position that the UK does not have a proud tradition of liberties?

The Greeks have laws regarding rights of the person versus the city-state going back thousands of years, perhaps we should have them draft all our HR legislation if seniority is such a valued commodity.

Die Übersetzung wird richtig sein, ob das Gespräch real ist, dürfte schwer zu überprüfen sein. 

Allerdings deuten die jüngsten Aussagen Putins darauf hin, dass das Flugzeug wohl von den pro-russischen Separatisten abgeschossen wurde:

*""Kremlchef Wladimir Putin hat der Ukraine die Verantwortung für den Absturz zugeschrieben. „Diese Tragödie wäre nicht passiert, wenn es auf dieser Erde Frieden gäbe, wenn nicht die Kampfhandlungen im Südosten der Ukraine wieder aufgenommen worden wären“, sagte Putin.

There is not a continuum between the laws of Greece today and the laws of the Greek city states.

I am simply saying that it is one of the reasons why the UK can put in place legislation for itself.

It's admirable, certainly but so are those of most other European countries, beginning with France in my personal opinion. And again you slip in a nonsense phrase like ""proud tradition of liberties."" This is literally meaningless filler.

This is a strawman, i've not said exceptional: I wrote ""proud tradition of liberties. Given that you yourself has said that the UK has an admirable history of rights, which is substantially equivalent, I find it very odd that you would argue with me on this point.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt;You really think the government never wronged someone due to bureaucratic inefficiency or stubbornness or an honest mistake? That long list of cases would indicate otherwise.

of course governments can wrong people. However, national courts can generally deal with cases that relate to bureaucratic inefficiency, stubbornness or am honest mistake.

That list of cases did not relate to cases that are just to do with honest mistakes and stubbornness etc. Most of the cases relate to interpretation of what is legal and deliberate actions of government. Also, these cases are not a list of cases that the UK has lost. It is a list of cases that the UK has fought. Even the cases that the UK has lost, don't, of themselves, show that the UK was wrong. They show instead that the echr disagreed with the UK courts.

&gt;Well, I think that's naive. Certainly, broadly speaking modern national courts are independent but I think it's an illusion that they are completely independent. Besides, that's short term thinking. Who says the independence of the courts can't be compromised in the future? The ECHR is an independent safeguard against that.

I'm not sure what country you are from, but in the UK the government loses cases in the national courts very regularly. Nobody thinks that the national courts are not capable of administering justice correctly. The important thing is not to be completely independent of the nation, but to be completely independent of the executive in administering justice. I don't think there is a real risk that the UK courts will stop being independent in the immediate future. The echr is thus a solution where there is no problem. 

&gt;Because the point is just to have a tool that is independent from your national apparatus. One additional system is enough for that. What qualitative value would further systems add?

As mentioned, the point is that the judiciary are independent of the executive and the legislature. That can work on a national level. I don't think the point should be that there is an international court that is independent of the national structure. That would only be needed if the national system were not sufficient.

&gt;Well, purely personally, in the majority of cases I've read about, I tend to agree with the ECHR's reasoning and the Court generally doesn't punish the states without strong reasons. Of course, there is no truly objective way to determine which court is better and some cases can be viewed as a mere difference of opinion (but some cannot, that last case seems at least after a quick glance, like blatant religious discrimination). At the risk of repeating myself, in such a situation I view the increased removal of the ECHR from national systems as a sufficient reason to prefer it. And since ECHR cases only involve an individual complaining against a state (and not an individual complaining against another individual or the state complaining against an individual), I'd rather err on the side of giving people more means to protect themselves.

The last couple of cases I read I have disagreed with the echr' opinion. In fact, it astonished me that the echr found that the French state has the right to forbid people from covering their faces in public. That judgment felt very foreign to me. I will read some more cases tomorrow however. 

I am generally a supporter of the individual against the state. But when the individuals being protected are convicted murderers in the UK who want to vote rather than French Muslims who want to cover their face in public, I wonder if the balance is where I want it to be. I recognise I am in a small minority on r/Europe and obviously I get downvoted a lot with most of my posts.

In general, Germans only speak to people they already know - talking to complete strangers is weird and generally frowned on. Which means that talking up random people is really weird and can be downright creepy.  
How do you meet new people? Generally through common interests or common friends. Common interests also includes work/study. You might meet a cute girl in your study group, or in your sports club, or at a friends' party.  
If you don't end up making out then it's generally best to take things slow - invite her to a party you are going to, or to some event. Somewhere you aren't alone. Give her the opportunity to take someone along. If she comes alone, great, she might like you :) From there you can basically go to inviting her over for dinner/movies alone and proceed in any way you want.  
Other things that might be different: Girls in Germany generally pay for themselves when going out. If they let you pay, they'll probably insist on paying the next time.

On the other hand, German girls aren't averse to a One-Night-Stand if you find the right one, but again, it's much easier if they at least know who you are - common  acquaintance, seen you in university, seen you at a sports club... You get the idea.

What? Name it. The South American coups were done mostly by South Americans. Guevara was captured in Bolivia by Bolivian forces, for example. Castro was even left alone. 

For Christ's sake, consider the following:

* Alaska was *bought* from Russia. The genesis of the US is particularly gruesome, countless natives were killed, many Englishmen, many Mexicans, even more Americans (Civil war), but 1 territorial acquisition was surprisingly formal and civil. I wonder why? 

* The US supported White Russian in the Russian civil war.

* The US then supported communists right after they prevailed.

* The US was Russia's ally in WW1.

* The US was Russia's ally in WW2.

* The US made no attempts to counter Stalin's ridiculous claim of half of Europe. Nothing, not even telling him to leave Berlin.

* The US allowed the Kaliningrad atrocity to occur. 

* The US made no attempts to help any European countries break away from the USSR. Even when the opportunity was practically handed to them (Hungary in '56).

* The US allowed Castro to exist. 

* The subsequent missile crisis was resolved in a manner that literally could not have been friendlier. One side apologized and took their missiles out of Turkey and the other also apologized and took theirs our of Cuba. 

* US involvement in Korea and Vietnam had little to no effect on the spread of Communism in those areas. Pol Pot's particularly insane, inhuman, takeover of Cambodia wasn't even opposed at all. 

* Even the Romanian revolution of '89, an overwhelmingly successful event, was not supported by the US.

* The US is staying out of the current Ukrainian-Russian war. Even after that plane got shot down and American citizens were directly killed in real life by Russian military, all Obama said was *wow this is like really sad and stuff*.

And there are probably way more examples. All of this is common knowledge. Accessible to everyone who can read Wikipedia. If you can look at all this and still think that Russo-American relations are anything but fundamentally friendly, I'd love to know what your thought process is.

&gt;Le pouvoir de Poutine repose sur son immense popularité, sur les résultats des élections, sur ce qu'il a fait pour la Russie depuis qu'il est au pouvoir, et après les résultats désastreux de Boris Eltsine.

Alors Pourquoi critiqué Porochenko ?? Il a bien eu un mandat fort et son résultat est basé sur des élections???il a raflé 54% des voix.. tout comme Poutine

&gt;Selon Dimitri Oreshkine, membre de la ""Ligue des Electeurs"" et conseiller auprès du président pour le développement de la société civile et des droits de l'homme, Vladimir Poutine aurait remporté l’élection avec 53 % des suffrages,

&gt;Lis un peu de Maurice Allais pour voir ce que fait le libre-échange quand on a des pays qui n'ont pas le même niveau de développement.

Pourtant Singapour, Hong Kong et Taiwan ont eu des accords de libre-échange et d'ouverture économique a outrance durant les 52 derniere années et ont su rattrapé les économies occidentales... Allais se goure.. Un libre échange est bénéficiable meme quand un pays n'est pas du meme niveau. Tout repose sur comment le pays gere l'accord...

true,Emnel,POLA,Poland,"&gt; Putin won't take Poland, no worries. 

Oh I know. That would be as suicidal as it gets. No one is really worried about that. Poland is homogeneous country so proxy rebel-war is out of the question and while our army may not be able to win a defensive war against Russia as of yet on it's own it is quite a capable and hardened force. Surely good enough to prevent any form of Crimea scenario. And all that is purely theoretical since anything like that is geopolitically impossible even in light of Ukrainian events. 

&gt; But knowing how much most Ukrainians in the West genuinely respect Bandera makes me confused as to how you care about them so much. Do Jewish people also care about Germans who support Hitler? Of course, Bandera was nowhere near that level, but it wasn't for the lack of trying, he did a firstrate job of ethnically cleansing the West of Ukraine from Poles and whatever Jews that Germans didn't catch. 

Yes, Bandera is a despicable figure but it's not like we should hate Germans to this day because of Hitler. However, as you pointed out Ukrainians are nowhere near Germans in terms of dealing with their ugly past. We choose to believe that those who respect Bandera are rather in denial of his genocidal actions than actually consider murdering Poles commendable. Thing is that Ukrainians have a victim complex and it is simply very hard for them to recognise themselves as perpetrators. It takes time. We should know since it took us, Poles, over a decade to come to terms with events in [Jedwabne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedwabne_pogrom) once book about it was published.

We assume that sooner rather than later Ukrainians will deal with it same way we and Germans have and all those atrocities will be put to bed once and for all.

&gt; Dunno why you care about Ukraine so much

Well, historically we have very different view of geo- and regional politics than Russia. We weren't conquering nations around us in order to get stronger.

Russia cannot condone the killing of civilians, no matter how much they previously supported the rebels.

They can hardly condemn the EU for protecting its citizens outside of Russia, as long as this is with the full support of Ukraine of course.

What I propose is making the war explicit (Ukraine + Allies vs Rebels) and as a result force Russia to back off; it cannot risk open conflict with EU nations. We should work with Russia to improve the security of the region. Make deals, undo sanctions, etc if they are willing to help prevent the rebels from operating from Russia's soil.

Astute observation. It has been doing just that. It built an oil rig in disputed water with Vietnam and rammed 7 Vietnamese ships opposing it. This was about 2 months ago. This was overshadowed by the situation in Crimea. China moved the rig yesterday, but was very clear it was in charge. When it put it there, it told Vietnam it should not oppose China ""if it knows what is good for it"" or something to that affect. 

The amazing thing is ASEAN invited the US to a summit to speak about ""regional security"". Its amazing what a few decades can do. The US fought such a bloody war with Vietnam in while many people today were still alive, now Vietnam is suggesting the US could be part of its deterrent against China.

I'm not opposed to you creating a FAQ type website outside reddit.com (kudos to you), and don't give a hoot whether you receive traffic from here or not, but have a few hesitations. First, it seems like you're putting in way more work than the size of the problem justifies. We're not overwhelmed with people posting questions. Yeah, they're repetitive and kind of annoying but there's not *that* many, seems to me. An updated FAQ with a bunch of links for the top 10-15 most asked questions would go a looong way. 

Second, from experience: unless you have an active community of people maintaining the FAQ/site (i.e. multiple people and a way for new people to start helping out), the info will quickly be out of date. (By quickly, I mean after a year or two.) This is why people use wikis. (Not just the Reddit wikis, but wiki-type sites in general, like wikipedia and wikia etc.) To create a long-term community resource, it has to be possible to revise &amp; update. If it's an external site that you control, that's hard to do, unless you're setting up a wiki.

Besides that, I would suggest that some of the topics are better addressed on other sites. Tourism questions are what the TripAdvisor forums are all about. Why not point people looking for a hotel or questions about sightseeing there? Immigration and expat questions are handled well at [the France expatforum](http://www.expatforum.com/expats/france-expat-forum-expats-living-france/). 

RE revising the sidebar: it could be as simple as adding a note near the top saying ""Check the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/paris/wiki) and do search in this subreddit before posting requests for help."" Again, take a look at what happens in /r/Seattle when you move your pointer over the ""Post a text post"" link in the sidebar. I haven't edited subreddit styling before, so can't give you info on how to steal that behavior, but I'm sure it's documented.

Finally, I'd like to reiterate the suggestion to first fix some of the obvious problems (no encouragement to anglophones to check the FAQ or do a search; FAQ doesn't answer some of the common questions) and see what happens before banning certain kinds of posts and mandating this ""open thread"" thing.

Le ton de l'article est clairement anti-russe. Tu as l'article wikipédia aussi. Tu peux aller sur [le Figaro](http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2014/03/01/01003-20140301ARTFIG00141-ukraine-la-reaction-crescendo-de-la-russie.php) aussi. Bref, tu t'es planté dans la chronologie.

&gt;Et cette loi n'a jamais passé dans le parlement Ukrainien..

Si. [Loi approuvée par 232 deputés sur 450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language_in_Ukraine#Regional_language_2012_.26_2014).

&gt;Évidemment Poroshenko est tellement imcompétent qu'il a renforcé le russe

Après le départ de la Crimée. Ma phrase d'origine était : ""Quelle bande d'abrutis quand même ces guignols à Kiev d'interdire le russe comme langue officielle en pleine crise et juste après un coup d'état.""

Allez au suivant.

&gt;Alors Pourquoi critiqué Porochenko ?? Il a bien eu un mnadat fort et son résultat est basé sur des élections???il a raflé 54% des voix..

Je n'ai pas parlé de Porochenko.

Au suivant.

&gt;Pourtant Singapour, Hong Kong et Taiwan ont eu des accords de libre-échange et d'ouverture économique a outrance durant les 52 derniere années et ont su rattrapé les économies occidentales...

La Corée du Sud est l'un des exemples de développement économique fulgurant avec un protectionnisme à outrance. Les théoriciens libréchangistes se seraient-ils trompés ?

Par ailleurs, ces états ont fait l'objet de politiques de spécialisations qui sont détaillées [ici](http://www.lyc-arsonval-brive.ac-limoges.fr/jp-simonnet/spip.php?article233), avec une intervention massive de l'État aux exportations et des barrières ciblées. Tu as un article wikipedia qui [détaille ça](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouveaux_pays_industrialis%C3%A9s).

Tu peux allier interventionnisme et protectionnisme (cas de la Corée du Sud), ou allier interventionnisme et libéralisme (Taïwan, HK ou Singapour) et réussir. Dans tous les cas cités, ça s'est fait avec une très forte intervention de l'état et une spécialisation nationale, on est donc bien loin du laissez-faire demandé dans les accords de libre-échange actuels.

&gt;Un libre échange est bénéficiable meme quand un pays n'est pas du meme niveau. Tout repose sur comment le pays gere l'accord...

Le libre-échange est bénéfique entre deux pays inégaux quand les deux  disposent d'un avantage comparatif par rapport à l'autre pays sans être concurrencé par d'autre membres de la zone de libre échange. Dans tous les cas, ces accords de libre-échange doivent être révisés si l'un des pays ne respecte pas les règles, c'est le classique [dilemme du prisonnier](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9orie_des_jeux_en_relations_internationales#Rapport_de_protectionnisme).

Concrètement, ces pays n'ont pas respecté les règles et ont profité sur le dos des autres.

&gt;Toutes ses études ont la meme conclusion l'accord désavantage les russes, avantagent les européens mais aura tres peu d'impact sur l'économie ukrainienne.

Ton papier [ici](http://www.case-research.eu/en/node/57643) arrive aux mêmes conclusions que Sapir : l'accord n'est bénéfique que si l'Ukraine devient stable, réalise d'importants investissements d'infrastructure et fait de nombreuses réformes.

Ton papier [ici](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=6&amp;ved=0CFgQFjAF&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fecomod.net%2Fsystem%2Ffiles%2FPaper_Frey.pdf&amp;ei=S2zIU56EC6rK0QWy1YDACQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSnwkqqr54Wmrsx7X9EPQ6mleu-w&amp;sig2=Enn2taSQ0s-wpUF6Xm57Qw&amp;bvm=bv.71198958,d.bGE&amp;cad=rja) fait comme si la Russie n'allait rien changer à son accord avec l'Ukraine alors que le libre-échange avec l'UE lui est néfaste...

Voilà voilà... donc effectivement, si la Russie accepte de se faire avoir, l'accord est neutre pour l'Ukraine. Si la Russie n'accepte pas, alors l'Ukraine se tire une balle dans le pied.",1,1405644240,null,0,false,0,cj0hq0n,t3_2ayove,t1_cj0hq0n,t1_cj0fwsb,null,1434769649,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

I could be completely wrong, as I don't really date anymore (just gave up), but:

Are you in Germany just for half a year/a year? Because I could see girls not going for it, because they think it would be somehow a waste of time. And that's not meant as an insult to you, but while you might have to leave Germany when the relationship would be getting really serious, they could spend the time with a guy living near them for a lot longer instead, you know? That's also why I think that other foreigner you met only got one night stands and nothing serious. We Germans don't seem like trusting people in general, so if you had to leave after a few months and told them, you will definitely come back for them, they probably won't believe you.

It's not like every girl just wants to get married etc. but a serious relationship would take time and if you have to leave and possibly won't come back soon/she would have to follow you, that could be a reason. I mean, I got dumped a few times, because one of us moved and it became a long distance relationship. And those were just different cities *in* Germany, where we could have met at least every other week.

That being said: you usually don't pick up a girlfriend at a bar or randomly on the street. Although I heard from girls, that they really think it's cute and ""brave"" by a man to just talk and compliment them on the street, I never heard of a guy picking up a girl that way.

Here's [Yats meeting with Obama](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/13/world/europe/ukraine-washington.html?_r=0) soon after being appointed. And here's a [Forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2014/02/27/washingtons-man-yatsenyuk-setting-ukraine-up-for-ruin/) on him:

&gt; *Washington's Man Yatsenyuk Setting Ukraine Up For Ruin*

&gt; “Recall the phone exchange between the Ukraine ambassador and Victoria Nuland (Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs) that got leaked out, where she basically said ‘we want Yats in there.’ They like him because he’s pro Western,” says Vladimir Signorelli, president of boutique investment research firm Bretton Woods Research LLC in New Jersey. “Yatsenyuk is the the kind of technocrat you want if you want austerity, with the veneer of professionalism,” Signorelli said. “He’s the type of guy who can hobnob with the European elite. A Mario Monti type: unelected and willing to do the IMFs bidding,” he said.

&gt; (...)

&gt; Yats had friends in high places and while he does not have strong support of the electorate, and would have no chance of winning an election, he is pro-IMF austerity and apparently the bulk of parliament is as well.

Here's the transcript of the call you mention with annotated [comments by the BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26079957)

&gt; Nuland: OK. He's now gotten both Serry and [UN Secretary General] Ban Ki-moon to agree that Serry could come in Monday or Tuesday. So that would be great, I think, to help glue this thing and to have the UN help glue it and, you know, Fuck the EU.

&gt; *(comment)* Jonathan Marcus: Not for the first time in an international crisis, the US expresses frustration at the EU's efforts. Washington and Brussels have not been completely in step during the Ukraine crisis. The EU is divided and to some extent hesitant about picking a fight with Moscow. It certainly cannot win a short-term battle for Ukraine's affections with Moscow - it just does not have the cash inducements available. The EU has sought to play a longer game; banking on its attraction over time. But the US clearly is determined to take a much more activist role.


So as I said before, the US pushed for a plan that was not in our best interest. They took the lead where we should be doing so. For the US the major goal here are geostrategic gains, pulling Ukraine towards the West. For us it'd have been way more important to have a stable Ukraine and good relations with Russia.

we don't know that. we can assume that because we think that article no 5 would do it's job in case of aggression. but first of all, we have to believe it 100%. do we tho? I do not trust most European countries seeing how their politicians are acting now to defend Baltics. and even if we believe article no 5 would work, we have to convince Russia Western countries would not leave Baltics alone. so far Putin is testing boundaries. every day. he is sending planes to test the Baltic air police mission (sounds of jets over Vilnius has become a norm these days), he is conducting military exercises in Kaliningrad and Belarus where they are pretending to cut off corridor Poland-Lithuania while attacking Baltics from every possible direction, he is sending his navy to our exclusive economic zone and disregarding our border guards, he is checking waters amongst Russian minority communities in the Baltics trying to find out whether they agree on Crimean scenario (thankfully our State Department says with no luck so far). not to mention what he is doing in Georgia/Ukraine/Moldava and going unpunished, he just sees weak Europe, he sees a lot of politicians and popular opinion shifting against US (while he has good relationship with radical right as well green/left parties in Europe). so, does he believe that he can't touch NATO/EU?

They are from yesterday.

Ukraine Army AA units have straight contact to international airspace monitoring (there is NATO AWACS and other things keeping them informed etc.) And they have not need to shoot anything down because the pro-Russian terrorists don't have aircraft. 

I've been monitoring this Ukraine conflict over 6 months now, quite close and I am 100% sure that it was the pro-Russians or Russians. 

I'm a Finn and have military training and a rank over lieutenant. We have that similar missile system in use in Finland (not for long). Just to say I'm familiar with that kinda weaponry. 

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/9K37_Buk_M1_SA-11_Gadfly.JPG

I doubt Russian Army also because they can also monitor airspace and rule out civilian aircraft. But the Donetsk Terrorists (I don't call them ""separatists"" any more because they are now proven to be real terrorists) could easily, knowing them being all kinda people from street criminals to nazies and x-military guys and Russian military advisors, insurgents and war tourists, shoot down anything that moves. Those massive idiots. They managed to raise a furry that will burn them in hell multiple times. And they deserve it.

It is time to set UN peacekeeping operation and go in. No more Putin licking, no more whining "" whattabout gas whattabout oil"", it's just fuck it.

He will probably make public announcement how Russia will help to arrest the people responsible and that's probably it, followed by lots of 'talks' and 'deals' with western leaders about that whole case.

**edit** Rules of civilization would probably be best described by international law and trade agreements.

Much policy comes from Washington, NYC, and London, so while you could say it's white people, it's more like educated &amp; powerful people in these countries. 

As an example, I think the [Washington Consensus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus) could be considered some of the rules of civilization. Once a poor country is in trouble, this is typically part of the reform package:

* Fiscal policy discipline, with avoidance of large fiscal deficits relative to GDP;

* Redirection of public spending from subsidies (""especially indiscriminate subsidies"") toward broad-based provision of key pro-growth, pro-poor services like primary education, primary health care and infrastructure investment;

* Tax reform, broadening the tax base and adopting moderate marginal tax rates;
Interest rates that are market determined and positive (but moderate) in real terms;

* Competitive exchange rates;

* Trade liberalization: liberalization of imports, with particular emphasis on elimination of quantitative restrictions (licensing, etc.); any trade protection to be provided by low and relatively uniform tariffs;

* Liberalization of inward foreign direct investment;

* Privatization of state enterprises;

* Deregulation: abolition of regulations that impede market entry or restrict competition, except for those justified on safety, environmental and consumer protection grounds, and prudential oversight of financial institutions;

* Legal security for property rights.

Naomi Klein wrote a book *The Shock Doctrine* in 2007 and argues that libertarian free market policies (as advocated by the economist Milton Friedman) have risen to prominence in some developed countries because of a deliberate strategy by some political leaders. These leaders exploit crises to push through controversial exploitative policies while citizens are too emotionally and physically distracted by disasters or upheavals to mount an effective resistance.

Tu n'a pas regardé les équations de Krugman attentivement et je cite...d'ailleurs cette théorie c'est de [l'économie expérimentale](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89conomie_exp%C3%A9rimentale). Et  au lieu d'impliquer un 2 pays elle peut impliquer deux bloc par exembles par exemple L'UE et l'ukraine dans la théorie seront considéré comme 2 pays. Comme je l'ai dit c'est de l'économie expérimentale alors attention..


&gt;Cependant la matrice montre **qu’ils ont intérêt à se mettre d’accord pour le libre-échange,** **ils sont tous les deux dans une meilleure situation (gain de +10 pour les deux)**. **Cet exemple simplifié montre que la coordination est l’issue favorable**.

Voici la suite du dilemne du Prisonnier tout est dans **la négocation**

Le dilemne ne rejette pas le libre-Échange au contraire elle l'accepte du moment qu'il y a des négociations!!! La majorité des accords de libre échange suivent ce modèle depuis les années 80.


L'Ukraine ne perd rien vu quelle reste neutre au contraire elle a de petits gains comme les études le montrent. Elle ne l'est s'est pas fait imposé vu que les négociations ont commencé il y a 4 ans sous Yanukovich. L'étude de son député chef que j'ai fourni(Que tu as choisi d'ignoré) est l'une des rapports de conclusion de ses négociations.


Puis quand j'ai dit

&gt; Un libre échange est bénéficiable meme quand un pays n'est pas du meme niveau. Tout repose sur comment le pays gere l'accord... 

C'est précisément ce que j'ai voulue dire. Relis la conclusion sur ton  dilemne et je la cite.

&gt;Cependant la matrice montre qu’ils ont intérêt à se mettre d’accord pour le libre-échange, ils sont tous les deux dans une meilleure situation (gain de +10 pour les deux)


 C'est ce que Taiwan et les pays asiatiques ont fait. Par bien géré je veux dire certaines exeptions comme eux ils ont fait pour leurs économies ce qui ne les a pas empéché d'avoir des accords de tout bord.

&gt;Ton papier ici arrive aux mêmes conclusions que Sapir : l'accord n'est bénéfique que si l'Ukraine devient stable, réalise d'importants investissements d'infrastructure et fait de nombreuses réformes.

1) Sapir devrait etre rejeté car son modele d'anayse est archaique et suit les exportations comme je l'ai dit plus haut sa méthodologie n'aurait pas été accepté dans aucune faculté.

2)Évidemment quand est ce que j'ai dit que l'Ukraine pourra jouir quand elle sera pas stable.. en tant qu'économiste se serait stupide de dire sa.. Pour l'instant la Russie est le seul obstabcle a cette stabilisation.

3) Le pouvoir Ukrainien des que Stabilisation arrive est en mesure de se stabiliser et de se développer. Puisque  maintenant les cercles politiques du pays sont définitivement concentré vers une intégration vers l'UE ce qui risque de les mettre sur une bonne voie.

D'ailleurs les événements d'aujourdhui risquent de mettre sur le banc les Pro russes. D'ailleurs je pense meme que la situation sera réglé d'ici la fin de l'été

&gt; Ton papier ici fait comme si la Russie n'allait rien changer à son accord avec l'Ukraine alors que le libre-échange avec l'UE lui est néfaste..

Faux le papier ne prend en compte que deux modele en excluant les autres facteurs. La Russie n'a que des accords gaziers et des traitements préférentielles l'analyse du papier exclue pour ne se concentrer que sur un modele EU-Ukraine.

&gt;This level of disaggregation allows only for
a very **rough** analysis of the distributional eﬀects of the EU-Ukraine FTA



&gt;All counterfactual experiments include the
elimination of import tariﬀs or **preferential tariffs** in all commodity groups for the EU-15 and EU-12 regions, while for all other
regions the calculated import tariﬀs remain valid


&gt;Voilà voilà... donc effectivement, si la Russie accepte de se faire avoir, l'accord est neutre pour l'Ukraine

Neutre implique aucun changement et etre neutre je n'appelle pas sa se tirer une balle dans les pieds. Par ailleurs toutes ses études montrent que l'Ukraine sera moins dépendant d'une seule source qui est avantageux et aura de petits résultats. Je ne qualifierai pas sa de neutre pour ce pays... et plus probablement une intégration dans l'UE dans un futur proche


Études 1
&gt; CGE modeling exercises and the practical experience of “deep” trade integration suggest a substantial potential for the future EU-Ukraine DCFTA in promoting trade and investments, creating additional welfare and employment, regulatory and institutional harmonization with EU’s acquis, and modernizing Ukraine’s economy


Études 2
&gt;in a CGE-microsimulation model for Ukraine shows that the distributional eﬀects of the EU-Ukraine FTA **are rather small**



&gt; Si la Russie n'accepte pas, alors l'Ukraine se tire une balle dans le pied.

Ukraine is a large area and many, many flights between Europe and Asia route over it. Already, some parts of Ukraine were being avoided by international flights due to the conflict. This part was not one that was being avoided. International flights even right now are still flying over some parts of Ukraine, but now avoiding significant parts of eastern Ukraine.

The amount of commercial airline traffic over that area is absolutely massive - probably thousands of flights a day. It's also worth highlighting how high the cruising altitude of a commercial international flight is - it is very, very high. So, lots of commercial aircraft very high up constantly.

In addition to this, typical shoulder mounted anti-air weapons previously known to be in use by the rebels in that area had a maximum practical height of around 2.5 km, which would have been no threat to commercial plans that cruise at around 10 km high.

Now however we are getting reports that they had Buk missile launchers in the area which are a significantly higher class of weapon - a medium range self-propelled missile launcher.

&lt; Das ist eine grauenhafte Verallgemeinerung. Das selbe raten einem Leute doch auch immer zum Englischen, dabei ist nichts so abstoßend wie ein Deutscher, der sich zwingt, ""gotta"", ""oughta"", ""he's/she's/it's"" und ""I'm"" herauszuquetschen, in seinem Leben kein einziges Mal ""will"" ausgesprochen hat und den Unterschied zwischen ""would"" und ""had"" nicht erkennen kann, wenn sie abgekürzt sind, weil er selbst einfach nur die Laute stammelt, die er einmal aufgeschnappt hat.

Ich spreche meine Sprache so, dass man sie versteht und andere Deutssprachige tun das genauso. In Wien bekäme man nie von jemandem den Rat, man solle ""nicht so formal reden"", denn obgleich hier statusunabhängig diverseste Dialekte gesprochen werden, hat man hier ein gewisses Faible für präzise Sprache. Sobald es aber darum geht, eine *Fremdsprache* zu erlernen, fürchtet sich jeder davor, womöglich nicht genau so zu sprechen, wie es in den Kulturkreisen der Zielsprache Konvention sein *könnte*, also zwingt man sich vorsichtshalber, alles auf was irgendwie ""colloquial"" wirkt nachzuahmen. Dabei vergessen die Leute vollkommen auf ihre logische Verständlichkeit zu achten.

Während meiner Aufenthalte in England und Gesprächen mit englischsprachig Aufgewachsenen habe ich von denen nicht annähernd halb so viele Abkürzungen gehört, wie ich im Zuge meines Englischunterrichts in Dialoge zu packen hatte, oder gar wie sie von meinen Klassenkameraden zu hören waren. Es gibt zwar definitiv genauso Englischsprecher die wissen, sich mit Abkürzungen und umgangssprachlich denotierten Begriffen präzise verständlich zu machen, wie es solche gibt, die dazu vorwiegend keine solchen Abkürzungen verwenden, aber beiderlei werden jemanden, der ohne abgekürzt genuschelte Wörter spricht, gleichermaßen verstehen. Genauso ist es im Deutschen: Vorlieben gibt es aller Art, aber die schwere Verständlichkeit eines Nichtmuttersprachlers liegt nicht darin, dass er sich nicht umgangssprachlich ausdrückt, sondern darin, dass er kein richtiges Deutsch spricht. [Das mal ganz davon abgesehen, dass ihn meist seine Aussprache schwer verständlich macht. In dem Punkt gebe ich dir übrigens völlig Recht.] Man nimmt bloß das ungewohnte Sprachverhalten vorrangig dadurch wahr, dass einem auffällt, dass es der Person im Vergleich zu anderen an abgekürzten Begriffen und kurzen, eleganten Sätzen fehlt. Aber das ist nicht, was sie unverständlich macht. Leuten, die Deutsch noch nicht ausreichend lange gelernt haben und die Sprache unpräzise verwenden, mangelt es meist schlicht an Verständnis der exakten Definitionen von Wörtern. Aber das ist nichts, was man mit etwas konventioneller wirkenderen Sprachgewohnheiten ausgleichen kann!

Im Gegenteil wirken sie meist eher verwirrend, denn wenn man sich mit jemandem auf kulturübliche Art mit jemandem unterhalten kann, ist man weniger vorsichtig, ihn zu verstehen. Es fällt dann weniger auf, wenn er Wörter falsch verwendet und die resultierende Verwirrung ist umso größer.

Wenn jemand so eine Empfehlung macht wie du, gehe ich davon aus, er vertritt die Ansicht Sprache wäre leichter zu verstehen wenn sie mit vielen Abkürzungen und ""informellen"" Merkmalen gespickt ist deshalb, weil er diese Art von Sprache von den Personen gewohnt ist, mit denen er sich gut unterhalten kann. Verständlichkeit deshalb in solchen Konventionen zu vermuten ist aber ein Trugschluss, denn die Kommunikation mit diesen Leuten funktioniert aus bloß kontextbedingten Gründen und weil es eben Muttersprachler sind.

Schlampige Sprache alleine tut noch nichts für Verständlichkeit und mir scheint ziemlich kurzsichtig, Sprachlernenden zu empfehlen, sie sich anzueignen, nur um Muttersprachlern das Gefühl zu geben, man könne gelassen mit ihnen sprechen, ohne sich anzustrengen. Der einzige Grund aus dem so viele Deutschsprachige gerne zu ihrem Schulenglisch greifen, wenn die Unterhaltung mit jemandem auf Deutsch nicht funktioniert ist doch, weil sie sofort die Geduld verlieren, wenn sie versuchen müssen, jemanden zu verstehen, der sich nicht exakt nach ihren Kulturmustern verhält.

Englischsprachig Aufgewachsene sind da deutlich verständnisvoller. Ich denke, wir sollten uns von denen etwas abschauen.",0,1405655281,null,0,false,0,cj0mcpu,t3_2avt1j,t1_cj0mcpu,t1_cizhbp1,null,1434771861,-1,false,German,t5_2qq51,-1

All that said, she does not seem to accept the token gestures she is seeing in the EU and has been critical of them (although, I will concede, this is easier to do when not in government). I would expect her to put pressure on under-performing NATO members and she would expect Europe to take care of European affairs. I like how she specifically pointed out it was a flight departing from Amsterdam and was shot down over European territory. 

You say you want her to be president now, but when the US Defense Secretary went to Brussels and warned the US could withdraw from NATO if spending cuts aren't halted, or at least members coordinate more, all European Defense ministers did was talk about what an uncouth meanie he was. They only continued making cuts and so far there has been very little integration. 

If she became president she may not accept ""those Americans dont know how to act diplomatically when they come to Brussels"" as the only response to US pressure on NATO members. In all fairness the US has been doing this for over a decade, so the time for kind words has ended.

Korea Air Flight 902 was shot down by a Su-15 despite the pilot reporting Korean characters on the tail.  It had strayed into Soviet Airspace by accident, didn't respond to Soviet ground control and the Soviets were convinced it was an American plane painted to look like a civilian airliner.  

There was a second incident where a Soviet pilot refused to fire on a civilian aircraft, al la the 902 incident, and was disciplined.

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-07-06/what-next-ukraine-ethnic-cleansing

Brzezinski is Obama's mentor from his days at Colombia &amp; was an official FP advisor for Obama's White House until recently.

It is Brzezinski's plan, from his book published in 1996, to take Ukraine for NATO in order to marginalize Russia. Hence Obama's coup in Kiev to install a US puppet government (which was Yats and is now Poroshenko).

Brzezinski has always been more interested in the Russians than anything else. Hence Obama's vote against the Iraq invasion - Brzezinski thought it was a needless distraction.

Hence why Obama has been trying for some time now, to provoke Putin into doing something that will give Obama the excuse to start a war with Russia (which Putin has studiously so far avoided). So maybe Obama is going to up the ante and massacre thousands and thousands of Eastern Ukrainians instead of just hundreds and see if Putin reacts to that.

N.B. The whole plan is a complete disaster because all it is doing is to drive Russia and China closer together faster. This will bring forward the end date for the US Dollar as the Global Reserve Currency and with it economic carnage in the US and the end of American hegemony.

China and Russia are not being given a choice. The US government is intent on committing economic suicide in America as quickly as possible and there is very little that China and Russia can do about it (while still protecting their interests). China and Russia would rather postpone America's economic collapse a while longer, but Obama and Brzezinski are forcing their hand.

This story needs to be investigated for veracity.

Translation of @spainbuca's twitter timeline. Says he works in Ukraine Air Traffic Control, saw the whole thing and that Kiev downed the plane. http://slavyangrad.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/spanish-air-controller-kiev-borispol-airport-ukraine-military-shot-down-boeing-mh17/

The Wall St Journal reports that Manpads (as possessed by East Ukraine rebels) have a maximum height range of about 13,000 feet. As above flight MH17 was flying at 33,000 feet. The civil aviation authorities had set a minimum height to fly over Ukraine of 32,000 feet (to be well out of range of Manpads.

N.B. The motive for Kiev to mount a false flag attack on a plane would be to get the US to supply heavy weaponry, planes, missiles etc. and possibly even ground troops to mount an invasion of Eastern Ukraine.

Putin has so far studiously avoided giving the US any excuse to launch an attack on Russia or become overtly involved in the civil war now raging in Ukraine.
