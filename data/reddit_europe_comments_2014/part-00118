&gt;What incentive is there to change?

Going with widespread standards would make a lot of things easier, UK has lots of stand-alone solutions, just look at the power plugs etc.
I admit changing traffic is no option nowadays and has hardly benefits compared to its drawbacks, it was merely to point out this issue

&gt;Also rather focused on USA (and taking their bad habits ;) ) and Commonwealth than Europe (except the Scottish)

true,100courics,HUNG,Hungary,"We have three large carriers: Telenor (Hungarian), T-Mobile and Vodafone. There is also Tesco Mobile, but that's usually used by students who are only here for a few months and need a line without contracts.

4G LTE entered Hungary either last year or two years ago. It's efficient in the cities, but spotty at best in the countryside. 3G is in cities and towns, but gets spotty in villages and doesn't exist outside of them, just like 4G and 4G LTE. If you're in the middle of nowhere in Hungary, you might not even have normal signal, let alone data.

I don't know if each of the large carriers targets a certain demographics, but I doubt it since I know people of similar backgrounds who use different ones. I will say this, however: from what I've been seeing, for a decade now, is that Vodafone is the priciest. I've used them for a bit, and it had the crappiest coverage around the country; could really only count on data within city/town limits.

As far as phone types go, I'd say iPhones are by far the most popular; practically every second teenager's phone is an iPhone. I'm a Windows Phone kind of guy, but I see why the Apple product appeals to so many people. Not enough to impress me though :D

""Puszi"" is a Hungarian term used to mean ""kisses"" of some sorts when you're saying your byes to someone in person, or on the phone. I think the French do the same with the word ""bizu"", or I could have it wrong. Anyways, it's just a way to say kisses/hugs and kisses/ xoxo (without looking like tools). Often the word is actually followed by kisses on the cheek.

The problem is the Hungarian ""sz"" translates to the English ""s"" (in contrast to languages like Polish where ""sz"" would translate to ""sh"" in English, I think).

So Hungarians learned to not say their byes like that in foreign environments - especially English-speaking regions - because it looks weird to the locals when a Hungarian talks on the phone, then hangs up like, ""sdjnakdjfalkjf adsklak paprika flakdjg fdafrla pussy pussy pussy!""",0,1398479365,null,0,false,0,ch2a18s,t3_23ztsh,t1_ch2a18s,t3_23ztsh,null,1433525121,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Gipsy kids were going to school, adults were working, although often took low wage simple jobs. This attitude had some momentum even after the communist regime broke in 1989. My dad had a restaurant in the 90s and had quite a few gipsy employees. Kitchen staff, waiters etc. They did the job, got the payment, like everyone else.

What was their motivation for insisting on that part especially when they controlled the rest of Greece anyway? And if you are still in doubt even the earliest inscriptions etc. point to them speaking a variation of greek. Archaeological evidence has shown that the Ancient Macedonians spoke a ""Doric greek"" language even before the classical age.

And during those times, the semantics of what ""greek"" means hadn't settled down yet. It could be that that they were thinking ""greek means he speaks greek and he shares the same culture as the greeks"" (Ancient Macedonians didn't pass the 2nd criterion until much later). They might have even thought that you don't deserve the title if your culture wasn't advanced enough. There might have been political reasons to exploit that.

If you just attempt to get a general consensus of what the view was before Alexander, there doesn't seem to be anything conclusive. The definitive sources like Hesiod etc. and even historians like Thoucydides give contradictory statements. The whole thing was still taking shape. They didn't have 20th century archaelogical and linguistic criteria around, but we do and according to those the most logical conclusion is that they were a ""greek tribe"". 

And about 60 years after Alexander there was no question about it.

true,famousonmars,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt;They just look japanese. Who the fuck cares about that?

Americans do.  Americans unlike cosmopolitan westerner Europeans have two identities.  One ethnic, and one cultural.  Slavic people do the same thing.  Is it because ethnicity is taboo in Germany?      

I myself immigrated to the USA almost 40 years ago but I still consider myself at least part Scot for growing up in Glasgow and visiting every summer, and because of keeping those connections alive I've imparted a bit of that culture on two generations of my family in the US. 

You are acting as if you can't produce German culture outside of Germany.  I disagree.  The second largest consumer of sauerkraut in the world is the USA.  Food is culture and Americans have assimilated German culture into what it means to be an American for 100's of years.  Why can't you be proud that generations upon generations of Americans consider themselves ethnically German in part even after all this time?  It is the ethnic part, is it not?      

This is the [German American School](http://www.gspdx.org/) that one of my friend's grandchildren goes to.  The kid is not even remotely German, in the least.  He is ethnically Filipino.  Yet, that school would not exist if some Americans did not identify ethnically/culturally as Germans and continue to support it financially.

Because the local native American cultures for one are 100's or even 1000's of years older than most European cultures.  So cities that have integrated that into their cultural identities are arguably older than European cities.  

In the Pacific NW there are tribes that have gatherings that have been going on since before the Pyramids were built with oral histories to back them up.  The UK still can't agree what went on at Stonehenge.    

&gt;Even if that were true... So?

Because the EU is homogenizing as it federates.  Same thing happend to the US when it went federal.  English is already the lingua de franca of the EU.  In the next 100 years you will start seeing English wholly replace other languages.  If it happened to the Welsh, the Scots, the Cornish, etc.  It will happen to you.

true,Kazath,SWED,Sweden,"I feel this thing about heritage less tricky than it seems. As a Swede, I sure find it interesting to know where my ancestors came from. I visited a relative who had done some researching into my family and he'd come over a church text 500 years old in Norrland which a distant relative of mine wrote. My fathers father claims there's some Dutch/Walloon blood in his side of the family, even though I'm shining blond and blue-eyed. 

So with that in mind I can claim to be of Norrlandic/Svealandic/Dutch heritage. The ancestors for Americans is even less far removed then so, so I see no problems with an american finding interest in their half Swedish, quarter Finnish, quarter German heritage. 

I can see why Americans feel it's more important. I can safely say to have had family ties in Sweden for at least 500 years, and humans have populated Europe in at least 17'000 years. But an american can have had a relative just three generations ago emigrate from Europe. And which part they emigrated from in such a culturally diverse continent can be quite interesting. Many feel family and ancestry is important, it's a basic human feature and is why the middle-ages were so dominated with family legacy and the ""family name"". 

Of course, if you go back 20 generations I'm probably related with all ethnic Swedes; 50 generations every ethnic European and probably a lot of the rest of the world. Go even further and I'll find family ties to every living thing on this planet, animals, plants and bacteria. That's basic biology for ya.

So what do I feel about americans claiming heritage? I say go for it! I don't mind in the slightest. ",0,1398494985,null,0,1398495269,0,ch2f7bw,t3_23zcbr,t1_ch2f7bw,t3_23zcbr,null,1433527557,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Although I have to admit it is tricky over there. There are many (really many) people with Basque surnames, for example, but most of them are not of Basque descent.

""Big military dick"" isn't what I would use to describe [Eurocorps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurocorps). Of course, this looks differently when you combine the military of the member states, but they just aren't. They *can* be, through NATO when the shit hits the fan, but that defense policy is still a national matter shows where the powers are in relation between the EU and its members *in this policy area*. I'm all for a common European military, but that's about as sensitive of a transfer of sovereignty as it can get.  

So much for the ""big stick"". It's similar with the ""speak softly"", the other thing Baroness Ashton is the ""representative"" for. We haven't come far when it gets to a common foreign policy, yet. As with security policy, foreign policy is still very much a jealously guarded national competence.

For the most part, the EU is a framework to regulate the Single Market. Just look at its budget. It's about 1% of GDP (less than military expenditures), with the largest chunk going towards agricultural policy. Of course it varies a lot how cost intensive the various areas of policy are (say, foreign policy vs. social programs), but it gives you a rough idea.  
We're ever so slowly moving beyond that, but every step along vertical integration requires a transfer of sovereignty from the national governments to the EU. And since those areas of policy inherently still are outside of EU competences, *all* 28 national governments must agree. You know from your own history how popular transfers of sovereignty to a central government tend to be.

So, yeah, the EU *could* be much more powerful in areas of foreign and security policy, *if* we pooled our resources. Maybe those events will be one of those nudges you mentioned that will help us to get there, but as of yet, we still have a long way to go.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  Are you familiar with the proverbial white American pre-sliced bread?

We've got this ""bread"" over here as well, but we don't call it that. We refer to it as ""toast"", even while it's still in the package, because toasting is the only conceivable thing one might want to do with it. I'd say that a typical supermarket only has about three brands with maybe two varieties each (wholemeal and normal). I never understood why bread coming sliced was supposed to be a good thing.

&gt; The states made that unsettling transition decades ago, I've endured the brunt of mass-market consumerism my whole life.

Germany actually is quite an interesting place, when it gets to (especially) groceries shopping culture. Maybe you've heard about how Walmart made its first attempt at entering a foreign market in Germany of all places. Legal (employees' rights) and cultural (greeters, baggers) issues that taught them to use local managers aside, Walmart had to give up because Germany is the most competitive market in the world, when it gets to groceries shopping, and the players mostly compete on price and price alone. There's no social stigma attached to shopping at discounters; to the contrary, it's considered prudent. Walmart just couldn't keep up with Aldi, Lidl and so on on their home turf.

Unfortunately, this fetishism for penny pinching affects bread as well. You can still find proper artisan bakeries, but odds are you'll pass two chain bakeries on your way, not even counting those in supermarkets. Most people don't value quality enough to go the literal extra mile, and it's very difficult to explain to them why bread rolls in the *proper* bakery cost a couple cents more than in the ones that merely heat up the ones that came pre-baked from the factory for a couple of minutes. Plus, it's just convenient to pick up a bread when you're already shopping for groceries in a supermarket.

I will teach you in my verse

Sounds like corpse, corps, horse, and worse.

I will keep you, Suzy, busy,

Make your head with heat grow dizzy.

Tear in eye, your dress will tear.

So shall I! Oh hear my prayer.

Just compare heart, beard, and heard,

Dies and diet, lord and word,

Sword and sward, retain and Britain.

(Mind the latter, how it‚Äôs written.)

Now I surely will not plague you

With such words as plaque and ague.

But be careful how you speak:

Say break and steak, but bleak and streak;

Cloven, oven, how and low,

Script, receipt, show, poem, and toe.

Hear me say, devoid of trickery,

Daughter, laughter, and Terpsichore,

Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles,

Exiles, similes, and reviles;

Scholar, vicar, and cigar,

Solar, mica, war and far;

One, anemone, Balmoral,

Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel;

Gertrude, German, wind and mind,

Scene, Melpomene, mankind.

Billet does not rhyme with ballet,

Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet.

Blood and flood are not like food,

Nor is mould like should and would.

Viscous, viscount, load and broad,

Toward, to forward, to reward.

And your pronunciation‚Äôs OK

When you correctly say croquet,

Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve,

Friend and fiend, alive and live.

Ivy, privy, famous; clamour

And enamour rhyme with hammer.

River, rival, tomb, bomb, comb,

Doll and roll and some and home.

Stranger does not rhyme with anger,

Neither does devour with clangour.

Souls but foul, haunt but aunt,

Font, front, wont, want, grand, and grant,

Shoes, goes, does. Now first say finger,

And then singer, ginger, linger,

Real, zeal, mauve, gauze, gouge and gauge,

Marriage, foliage, mirage, and age.

Query does not rhyme with very,

Nor does fury sound like bury.

Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth.

Job, nob, bosom, transom, oath.

Though the differences seem little,

We say actual but victual.

Refer does not rhyme with deafer.

Fe0ffer does, and zephyr, heifer.

Mint, pint, senate and sedate;

Dull, bull, and George ate late.

Scenic, Arabic, Pacific,

Science, conscience, scientific.

Liberty, library, heave and heaven,

Rachel, ache, moustache, eleven.

We say hallowed, but allowed,

People, leopard, towed, but vowed.

Mark the differences, moreover,

Between mover, cover, clover;

Leeches, breeches, wise, precise,

Chalice, but police and lice;

Camel, constable, unstable,

Principle, disciple, label.

Petal, panel, and canal,

Wait, surprise, plait, promise, pal.

Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair,

Senator, spectator, mayor.

Tour, but our and succour, four.

Gas, alas, and Arkansas.

Sea, idea, Korea, area,

Psalm, Maria, but malaria.

Youth, south, southern, cleanse and clean.

Doctrine, turpentine, marine.

Compare alien with Italian,

Dandelion and battalion.

Sally with ally, yea, ye,

Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, and key.

Say aver, but ever, fever,

Neither, leisure, skein, deceiver.

Heron, granary, canary.

Crevice and device and aerie.

Face, but preface, not efface.

Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass.

Large, but target, gin, give, verging,

Ought, out, joust and scour, scourging.

Ear, but earn and wear and tear

Do not rhyme with here but ere.

Seven is right, but so is even,

Hyphen, roughen, nephew Stephen,

Monkey, donkey, Turk and jerk,

Ask, grasp, wasp, and cork and work.

Pronunciation (think of Psyche!)

Is a paling stout and spikey?

Won‚Äôt it make you lose your wits,

Writing groats and saying grits?

It‚Äôs a dark abyss or tunnel:

Strewn with stones, stowed, solace, gunwale,

Islington and Isle of Wight,

Housewife, verdict and indict.

Finally, which rhymes with enough,

Though, through, plough, or dough, or cough?

Hiccough has the sound of cup.

My advice is to give up!!!

That's pure fantasy.

&gt;Because the EU is homogenizing as it federates. Same thing happend to the US when it went federal. English is already the lingua de franca of the EU. In the next 100 years you will start seeing English wholly replace other languages.

Nonsense. If there is one thing we are seeing as a direct effect of the EU it is NOT homogenization but *regional*ization. The EU strengthens the political and cultural impact regions have at the expense of the nation-state level. 

A secondary language can be as lingua franca as you want, that doesn't mean that it replaces the native language. Otherwise we would all be speaking latin. Especially since there a vastly more native German or French speakers than there are native English speakers in the EU.

Firstly, in the U.S., the government has only those powers that are *specifically* granted to them, with everything else remaining in the hands of the citizens. In the UK, the government holds to itself all rights *except* in areas where it is restricted by law. 

Thankfully we have enough laws restricting the government, built up over centuries, that the end result is more or less the same. But the attitude that the different approaches represent carries through to daily life.

____

Secondly, the U.S. attitude favours the rights of the individual, while European attitudes favour the rights of the collective. If you're doing something that is blatantly against the interests of your neighbours, to the point that anyone with an iota of common sense would realise it, the collective wins out regardless of whether or not it offends the individual.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"&gt;Admittedly, the gesture might be a bit misplaced, and I can definitely see how it might get tiring if you hear it all the time. But I can't really wrap my head around the hostility you run into sometimes. If I was in Europe and someone told me that they were American because their grandfather lived in America, I'd be pretty ok with it. Kind of confused because the interaction is the compete oppose from usual, but not offended.

I think Europeans are a little but defensive about their own cultures these days, but I think that we're very justified in doing so. American culture, products and so on have spread a lot through globalisation, so much so that a lot of media created in, say, England for example, can end up having a lot of American cultural slants, despite not being from or for America. 

It'll usually still be a good product, but you can't help but feel vaguely marginalised. You can't help but feel that largely the things which your culture values and you value are being ignored in favour of some sort of vague internationalism. 

Admittedly, our cultures are not under threat. British culture, English, Scottish and Welsh cultures are not going to die out any time soon. So we don't really mind all of the American stuff seeping into our culture even if we don't really like it. Hey, we often get some great TV from it, like Breaking Bad (and I hope you get some good TV from us in return..). 

However, when an American then comes over to a country that he has no connection to apart from a few relatives having lived there several centuries ago and then claims some sort of ownership of your entire culture whilst simultaneously understanding nothing about that culture it can touch on a nerve which has already been vaguely pressed for decades and it's not something a lot of people are willing to politely let be pushed further. When I'm arguing with a Lancastrian about the Wars of the Roses and how Yorkshire (Where I come from) is so totally better because King Henry VII won the war, and that our tea is better et cetera, I wouldn't be very happy if an American pulled up a chair and expected to be treated as an equal in that conversation because he had a relative once who was from Lancashire and is therefor just as much legitimacy to talk about the subject as someone who's lived it their entire lives. 

It's very admittedly a very narrow cross section of Americans who would do this, but I think that this nerve in a lot of Europeans is harder pressed than people realise and can be inflamed by only a very limited number of people touching it. 

I'm not sure if this will-be/was insightful to anybody and it might just be me extrapolating how I feel and projecting it onto people around me, but I feel as though it's somewhat representative and hope it's of some use to somebody in understanding.

true,Fornad,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; The Picts and Gaels and Bretons were the aboriginal people of the UK

So, let me get this straight. These people arrived in Britain first, and then later on their descendants intermingled and fought over generations with various waves of people who arrived later on. Now the mixed descendants of all these peoples now live in Britain, and this somehow constitutes genocide? Because we don't have pure Pictish culture in Scotland? These are ridiculous claims.

&gt; the dissolution of entire cultures, including oral/written histories, native craftsmanship

Let's take the Picts as an example. Pictish language and culture did not disappear suddenly as a result of some kind of ethnic cleansing, it's simply that the kingdom of Alba slowly became Gaelicised, and descendants of the Picts eventually came to speak Gaelic. Due to other influences and innovation, their culture was changed over time. **Their culture was not systematically destroyed by an outside oppressor**, and the same is true of peoples across Europe.

Where do you think the Europeans living in Europe today came from? It entirely depends on where you draw the line - the Basques are assumed to descend from the populations of the Atlantic Bronze Age directly, whilst early Indo-European groups (including the Beaker people who later became Celts/Picts) arrived in Europe later on, by the Bronze Age. Are the Picts therefore not indigenous to Europe? I suppose it doesn't matter that their culture wasn't preserved, then.

You seem to have this idea of a preserved culture, but that really only happens in societies that do not intermingle with other societies and their cultures (see: Native Americans, Sami) and thus do not advance, both socially and culturally. The reason we do not see Pictish craftsmanship is that the Picts encountered new, better methods of making things, not because their society was purposely eradicated.

You may notice that we're not speaking Old English, and Anglo-Saxon craftsmanship has not been preserved or cherished in England, but the Anglo-Saxons weren't ethnically cleansed.",0,1398506282,null,0,false,0,ch2h3pm,t3_23uyd4,t1_ch2h3pm,t1_ch272lg,null,1433528520,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

If anything goes not as planed, or are they are given order to crash, the pilots would be most likely captured by local police and detained for months.

Example case: 

Publicly known incident in 2005, Lithuania, where Russian jet flew through Lithuanian territory illegally and crashed. Official cause of the crash is faulty avionics, but it isn't something believable even without knowing the further facts. Why? Because the Kaliningrad border (over which the plane supposedly flew over) with Lithuania is a river, you really can't miss it, it's a pretty big river.

Now even according to wikileaks, the state officials knew that the official story was BS. Now this isn't public knowledge, but from stuff I was told by our military guys, the Russian jets flew deep into Lithuania's territory periodically (from Kaliningrad to the other side of Lithuania and back), and this was happening roughly until 2006 (haven't heard that these kinds of things are happening now). It is how Russians taunted us and NATO, because our shitty radars didn't pick their planes up, and when they did, the NATO jets would scramble to intercept.

Oh, and when the Russian jet crashed here in 2005, US refused the offer to help decipher the black-box of the jet, and offered in the French instead. I have no knowledge of did the French help or not, or what was found in box.

If Russia was to try and live in complete economic isolation from the international community it would come under a lot more fire from authority figures for a lot of different reasons. 

Firstly, Russia would have a much harder timing executing the absolute authorative control the North Korean government does, given the sheer size of the territory Russia presides over.

Secondly, the veil slipped over the eyes of the people of North Korea in the mid 20th century, well before the information age. Trying to control the masses in Russia who have been readily exposed to outside information since at least the end of the cold war some 20 years ago will be much more difficult.

Thirdly, with my second point in mind do you really think people with the slightest idea of what's going on (there would be quite a few at this point) would wish to stay in Russia? There would be an unprecedented brain drain which the Russian government would be poorly equipped to control.

There's a lot more that would be holding them back from becoming a hermit state, but I dont want this wall of text to drag on forever.

I don't know. According to Wikipedia he makes some quit outlandish predictions:


Friedman's prediction, in the early 2020s, Russia will collapse, Finland will annex Karelia, Romania will annex Moldova. Around this time China will politically and culturally fragment as well.

Friedman predicts that a third world war will take place in the middle of the 21st century, close to the year 2050. He asserts that the United States will face a coalition of the Turkish and Japanese empires. Friedman states that Germany and France may enter into the conflict during its later stages, probably on the side of the Turkish and Japanese empires.

And from the books review in the San Francisco Chronicle:

Friedman's strangely provincial stance resembles some frightened insomniac who can't stop playing Age of Empires because he desperately needs to win before dawn.

Friedman envisions a hostile future, in which the United States will create hypersonic ""missiles that can be fired from space with devastating effect."" **He foresees gargantuan ""Battle Stars"" locked above Earth in geosynchronous orbit.**

And one gets the uncomfortable feeling that Friedman isn't so much a reasonable man who has devoted his life to tracking foreign policy but a wild-eyed guy in fatigues holed up in his garage, sliding miniature armies across a mammoth map.

There's a certain entertainment value to some of Friedman's wilder prognostications, but I felt an overwhelming desire to give him a hug. 

Here is a man determined to see nothing more than international anguish, but the real tragedy is that **the black-helicopter crowd will buy into Friedman's flummery** because hope was something they abandoned in last year's election cycle.

Soviet Union was competing for global domination. Russia just tries to gain limited geostrategic advantages in Eurasia. 

Thinking this crisis as battle where you either win or lose is not how countries think. Everyone tries to advance their own interests and limit damages. 

What  interests bigger sanctions would serve? Crimea is insignificant to western interests. Even the Ukraine is small compared to Russian economy and its dealings with the European economies. US is more interested, because it competes with Russia in Eurasia.

I don't really see how people can talk about ""European colonialism"" when the majority of European nations didn't hold any colonies. 

And really as far as the ""blame game"" is concerned the ones shouting about colonial debt might want to take a look at the rest of the world they actively ignore as Murray rightly points out in the debate. 

If we actually accepted that bullshit line of argument then Turkey is similarly obligated to take in Greeks over their Byzantine conquest and Slavs, whom they even enslaved through Dev≈üirme. 

Think the ex-Caliphate countries would be keen on accepting colonial debt for conquering 90% of Africa, all of Spain and the slavery of East European Saqaliba and Africans?, slavery which went on for around 900 years more than Atlantic slavery did?

I'm not even going to bother dredging through all the stuff in Asia in terms of the Mongols, Chinese, Japanese, Mughals etc.

Cela dit, il y a certaines choses qui font que beaucoup d'entreprises ont encore int√©r√™t √† produire en France: Une infrastructure hyperd√©velopp√©e, bonne pour la logistique, un front de mer qui permet d'acheminer des mati√®res premi√®res de n'importe quel autre continent, un personnel qualifi√©, etc.

A titre personnel, je pense que ces avantages ne comblent pas les inconv√©nients que l'on conna√Æt. Mais √ßa va clairement colmater la br√®che - apr√®s tout, malgr√© le ralentissement r√©cent, on re√ßoit encore beaucoup d'IDE.

Si on fait abstraction de √ßa, on a quand m√™me des avantages: Comme l'avait dit Dominique de Villepin un jour, il faut se sp√©cialiser. Les startups technologiques fran√ßaises ne PEUVENT PAS entrer en comp√©tition avec celles de la silicon valley, tout comme les usines fran√ßaises ne PEUVENT PAS se battre contre les indiennes ou les chinoises. Ca rel√®ve de la science-fiction. Cela dit, on a encore une production agricole exceptionnelle, une marque ""made in france"" dans le luxe qui est tr√®s respect√©e, un secteur viticole et un art de vivre... 

Il faut booster ces secteurs √† fond, luxe, agricole, mais aussi la haute-technologie hypersp√©cialis√©e (des PME fran√ßaises fournissent en sous-√©quipement les plus grandes majors p√©troli√®res mondiales, mais on n'en entend jamais parler!). Bref, jouer √† fond sur la qualit√©, et l√¢cher tous les secteurs sur lesquels on n'a pas d√©j√† une longueur d'avance. C'est la th√©orie des avantages comparatifs de Ricardo, √† laquelle je souscris. Et pourtant, on entend toujours parler des usines sid√©rurgiques qui n'ont plus raison d'√™tre mais qu'il faudrait (apparemment) sauver √† grand renfort d'argent public...

Et puis, si l'on veut devenir un pays producteur polyvalent √† l'am√©ricaine, je le r√©p√®te: on sait exactement ce qu'il faut faire, mais on ne veut pas prendre le risque politique.

This sentence is so evidently wrong I don't really know where to start explaining why it's wrong.

&gt; and if you honestly believe that the African and asian nations were peaceful nations when they were conquered you probably need a history check.

It's not that people don't know this, it's more that it's irrelevant. When we colonized those parts of the world we made them serve our interests, rather than their own, for centuries on end. Their agriculture, their industry, their trade, their education, their military were all made subservient to us. If you think this hasn't made a difference and gave those countries considerable disadvantages that last to this day, I'm afraid you are the one who needs a history check.

&gt;The difference is that most of you don't make a differentiation between nationality and heritage.

Yeah, it's all a matter of context. I was born and raised in the northeast. Half of my great grandparents came from Italy and the rest from the UK. Needless to say they brought with them traditions that remained in our household - everything from food to euphemisms, and even superstitions (don't let anyone give you the malocchio). 

This stood in stark contrast to my neighbors who, in my particular town, were almost all of Polish descent. They spoke Polish in their households, ate Polish food and held Polish festivals complete with polka music. 

While we all identified as Americans, it's hard not to be singled out by heritage in this context. I wasn't, ""Polish"" like those around me and was absolutely treated differently because of it. As such, I learned to identify as being Italian (mostly because of my surname) or less commonly British. But of course I don't mean *nationality* when I say that, I simply mean *heritage*.

To add to this, I've since learned that not all regions of the US follow this practice. I now live in the south and here I am simply, ""American"" by any definition. Because, ""how can you be born in the US and be Italian? That doesn't make any sense...""

The biggest difference between their cities and Glasgow is Glasgow is deeply scarred by industrial decline. It is, however, improving massively and has been doing so for decades. The crime rate, the economic status, the infrastructure and the built environment are worlds away from those of the 'no mean city' days that Glasgow got its current reputation from. 

One of the biggest secrets in Glasgow is that, actually, the city is pretty nice. Much of the city was built in the 19th century, by the tobacco and sugar barons, and was, then, described as the beautifullest in the Empire, behind only London. Glasgow has great bones, they're being very successfully fleshed out.

Honestly changing that mentality would be the best thing that could happen to the Euro. It would allow for federalized policies to be enacted that make a more cohesive union, namely federal taxation and borrowing. I talked about this with a few other people on this sub. The Eurozone has no mechanism to automatically smooth out disparities that arise when one monetary policy does not fit every country. 

The largest tax burden in the US is Federal Income Tax. Yearly, there is a very substantial wealth distribution from wealthy, urban, states to poor rural states. This is even more acute with lower income territories like Puerto Rico, where Federal inflows make up 20-25% of their GDP. This helps smooth over discrepancies that would otherwise exist when a monetary policy that worked in New York might not be the best monetary policy for Mississippi or Puerto Rico. There is no mechanism like this in the Eurozone to smooth over discrepancies when Germany's optimal monetary policy is not the same as Greece's.

On that same note, rich countries would be picking up the bill for poorer countries. Keep in mind, federal income tax is the largest tax burden for individuals and corporations in the US. In my state 30% of federal income tax goes to poorer states (or internationally), its up to 45% for one state. So there would have to be enough solidarity that people accepted the fact a substantial portion of their wealth was going to go to less wealthy jurisdictions. As of right now that is clearly not the case in the Eurozone.

It took months of negotiating, countless meetings, and many protests to bail out Greece. Puerto Rico and Mississippi are bailed out by Americans in high income states every two weeks by a line item titled ""Federal Tax Withholding."" 

I completely agree, having more solidarity would go a long way. Although people would still have to be willing to give up some of their wealth in the way of wealth transfers. ",0,1398526631,null,0,false,0,ch2lk87,t3_23usht,t1_ch2lk87,t1_ch28gfr,null,1433530621,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; Also, companies with a lot of money can afford to be patent trolls just about anywhere.

No, a ""patent troll"" is not that, as much as some corporations (hi, Google, Samsung!) have tried to extend a definition to any litigious patentee. A patent troll is an entity whose business model turns entirely around the **threat** of patent litigation. To actual patent trolls, whether their patent is infringed, never mind valid, is almost entirely irrelevant: they simply extort licence fees from defendants who know that, in case of litigation, even a barebones defence is going to cost them more than the licence. This is very different from, say, Apple: Apple doesn't want a licence fee, it just wants to stop Googsung, and knows it needs solid, ironclad patents to achieve that.

And yes, the problem lies entirely in the US court system. Other countries grant patents of questionable validity. Indeed, in many countries the patent system is a pure registration system where patents are granted without any examination whatsoever, and in many others the examination is much more cursory than in the US: in France, for instance, patent applications are not examined for obviousness, only novelty. And yet, even in those countries, pure patent trolling is nowhere as prevalent as in the US. Why? Because a) patent litigation is about ten times more expensive in the US as in the next most costly country, and b) those countries enforce strict ""loser pays"" rules that ensure that frivolous patent litigation doesn't pay.

Amusing that you should frame it like that. If we're talking about the total consequence I would argue that Islamic control of Spain, which radically altered their entire way of life and quite a lot of the population from bottom-up, including the arguably just as radically different post-Reconquista Spain had a more profound effect on their national character than the more recent Morrocan colonialism.

I think it is more important to try to increase the quality of life for the lowest income in a country, not necessarily target inequality. By many metrics, the US middle class is one of the most high income in the world. If you look at US billionaires entrepreneurs are very strongly represented. Even by increasing the living standards of the worst off members of society, there will still be extreme levels of inequality. But I am not sure we want to limit opportunities to become wildly successful. In the link I cite statistics relating to immigrants starting business, so they have the ability to shop which country is the best fit. I think it is important not to regulate the US out of the top spot (for many of them). 

The homicide rate is fairly disgraceful. The US has a lot of urban problems that take a long time to fix. Keep in mind, black citizens were denied basic rights only a few decades ago. Minorities in other countries were as well (Saami were sterilized in Sweden up to 1979 for example) but because the population of a disenfranchised group in the US is so high, it causes serious issues. The good news is, new and innovative programs are trying to target these, and some [seem to be working](http://wmbriggs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/hom1.jpg). Other good news, is most Americans dont live in fear of being murdered constantly, they are very concentrated areas. Its a horrible way to live for the people in those areas (I know some that used to live in them), but the good news is that is not how the majority of the population lives. 

I agree 100% that changes can be made. Some are in process. But the income inequality statistics are where I tend to go against the grain.

No, it isn't for the reasons I specified. Reiterating the point is not a counter-argument.

That creates a huge disincentive, I will give you that. It also disincentivizes small patent owners suing large infringers.

true,Hesokou,null,null,"&gt; It's the correct way to frame the discussion, which isn't about national character but rather about the relative economic and social conditions of former colonial powers and colonies, like you yourself say a few lines below.

If we're talking primarily in those terms I wonder why we're pretending colonization was a complete devastation for all involved? 

In Morroco's case there was the international zone of Tangiers, more or less controlled by the Spaniards, French and Brits, commonly known at the time as the ""Pearl of Africa"".

&gt; Are you seriously claiming that there is a mass sentiment in Greece that they would like to emigrate to Turkey, if only they could? be serious.

Into Turkish territory certainly. Setting up parallel Greek communities in former Greek heartland would no doubt swell the breast of many a nationalist.

&gt;The fact that you don't like the current arrangement doesn't change the fact that it is what it is. 

The current arrangement is still not a European matter. It's one where individual states decide who gets to come into the EU and who do not and there are several ways of dealing with abuses. We legally have the right to deport asylum seekers to their entry point destinations like Italy for instance. There's also limits to how long they get to stay in a country without employment and several similar dealings regarding citizenship. 

&gt;Like you say, it has been made into a European matter.

An internationalist matter. That's largely being challenged by Europeans now.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt; Yeah, but why would they if they don't feel like being part of one nation?

That's my point exactly, it wont happen until more solidarity is felt. Germany flat out declined the prospect of Eurobonds.

&gt;You for instance, are you ready to kill and die for the right of say texans? Would you accept to give up 50% of your income to help urban youth (whose a majority is black)?

I live in Chicago, so I know every color and type of person you can imagine. Me and two people from bad parts of Chicago tried starting a non-profit company to help at risk students (almost exclusively black and Latino) get into university. I went to uni with a Somalian who watched his entire family get murdered and was the only survivor, or a Yemenese guy whos parents went without food for years so they could afford to emigrate. Those guys were both incredibly hard workers and driven. The Somalian guy was getting a masters in IT and the Yemenese guy was getting an undergraduate in finance. He already owned a few buildings though, at 22 his net worth was well over $1 million. I feel solidarity with all of them, and they're all Americans.

The people I dont really feel solidarity with are those who chose to do nothing. I am not saying poor people in general (or unemployed people), many poor people work harder than almost anyone else. But you will have some people that will prefer to live on government aid and not even attempt to change things. And they will flat-out tell you that. Obviously I consider them American, but dont think the situation is fair. Or you will find people on disability that are clearly not disabled, they would rather just sit at home. So that is who I dont want my taxes going to support. I think major programs are needed to help people who were historically disenfranchised, and I realize they cost money (as I said, I personally tried starting one). So I do feel solidarity with people, just not people who are proud to be lazy. 

Most Americans consider themselves American first, [insert state] second. That is why people in some states give up to 45% of their largest share of taxes to lower income states without protesting. Like I said for me it is 30%, and I know it is going to low income states, despite having things we could spend it on. 

So I think people feel strong solidarity in the US (especially after 9/11). ",0,1398529423,null,0,false,0,ch2mjw2,t3_23usht,t1_ch2mjw2,t1_ch2lqzg,null,1433531087,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,DejaBoo,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; I think Europeans are a little but defensive about their own cultures these days, but I think that we're very justified in doing so. American culture, products and so on have spread a lot through globalisation, so much so that a lot of media created in, say, England for example, can end up having a lot of American cultural slants, despite not being from or for America.

On the same token, but different (time, place, degree, and I feel more noticeable for Europeans) this is true here in the states as well.  I feel it has to do with the industrial revolution vs. expansionism.  I am curious how it has effected your culture and assume the industrial revolution would be noticeable where we can rule out expansionism compared to USA huge open lands (shrugs).  

Here, to be blunt our food went to shit between WWII until the last 20 years. Ignore the NYers and Chicago people, I said expansionism.  Corporations with increase shelf technology for can foods, chemicals, packaging, fast food and chain restaurants changed our entire landscape.  Meanwhile, local ranchers, farmers, butchers and restaurants owners began disappearing so crappy tv dinners, market foods and now mothers scramble to adapt recipes to boxed and canned *Shit*.  Basically: big business farms, ranches, restaurants are rising = mom and pops decrease the void was ""middle America"" getting hosed and most everywhere feeling the impact.

I'll give you generational anecdotal in my family beside creme rising to top from milk from the dairy man or other stories.   I never had lamb till I tried Indian food in my mid 20s (1990?) while in grad school.  I was like damn this is good and why in the hell is this my first time considering I came from rural ranching community background.  So, when I see my old man again I tell how awesome the lamb was and how come as kid we never ate any?

He's like, ""I hate lamb -- always ate lamb"" he snarled.  So, I'm like WTF?  Turns out after WWII the nylon industry changed the need of sheep for wool and thus the entire ranching industry was almost dead in an instant.  The USA is just so flexible/capitalistic it gives up it's ""cultural practices"".   I guess being a young nation right at the dawn of the industrial revolution has its drawbacks/perks (shrugs).

Having said all that, I feel that Americans hang onto to the littlest thing that makes us individuals apart from one another (e.g., favorite sports teams).

J'en avais parl√© dans un autre post, mais pour faire simple je pense que ce qui tue l'emploi et la cr√©ativit√© en France, ce n'est pas le co√ªt du travail (malgr√© ce que le MEDEF veut te faire croire) mais la sur-r√®glementation.

Premi√®re chose √† faire: Rehausser le seuil d'effectif √† partir duquel il est obligatoire de tenir des √©lections syndicales. Il est aujourd'hui √† 50. Une PME de 50 salari√©s qui √† la t√™te dans le guidon ne PEUT PAS se permetter d'organiser √ßa et de devoir composer avec un CE parall√®lement. Des d√©l√©gu√©s du personnel, bien s√ªr, les salari√©s doivent avoir des repr√©sentants, mais pas dans un cadre aussi lourd.

Bousiller le CDI. C'est tellement sur-prot√©g√© que les employeurs ont peur d'embaucher en CDI et multiplient par cons√©quent les CDD et int√©rims √† la limite de la l√©galit√©. Je l'ai vu, j'ai √©t√© RH en industrie. Or, alors que les entreprises ont peur d'embaucher en CDI, toute d√©marche personnelle n√©cessite un CDI. T'as d√©j√† essay√© de louer un appart', a fortiori en r√©gion parisienne, avec un CDD? Eh... Bon courage. A la place, il faudrait un contrat unique, a dur√©e ind√©termin√©e par d√©faut, avec une accumulation des droits progressive (Jours de cong√©s, pr√©avis de licenciement obligatoires, etc.) et surtout, il faut faciliter le licenciement pour sous-performance, car la r√®gle est trop lourde actuellement, et beaucoup de managers pr√©f√®rent mettre leurs salari√©s au placard et continuer de les payer (ce qui les expose √† une attaque aux prud'hommes du salari√©) ou les fliquer pour les pousser √† la faute grave. Dans tous les cas, j'ai √©tudi√© et v√©cu le droit du licenciement, c'est un chemin de croix pour les managers. Un engagement aussi lourd n'incite pas √† embaucher.

Ensuite? Compl√®tement √©clater cet archa√Øsme qu'est la repr√©sentativit√© des syndicats au niveau national (Je rappelle que jusqu'en 2008, un des crit√®res de repr√©sentativit√© √©tait ""l'attitude patriotique pendant l'Occupation"", c'est dire si les mentalit√©s √©voluent lentement). Id√©alement, il ne devrait pas y avoir de f√©d√©rations nationales de syndicats pour n√©gocier avec l'Etat, et je verrais plut√¥t des f√©d√©rations par secteurs pour n√©gocier avec les patrons desdits secteurs. Aucun accord salari√©s-patrons ne devrait √™tre plus √©tendu que le niveau de branche. C'est un non-sens de n√©gocier le m√™me truc pour l'employ√© de la grande distribution que pour le machiniste qui manufacture des semiconducteurs pour l'a√©rospatiale.

Les 35h au niveau national doivent partir - Laissons les secteurs n√©gocier √ßa en interne.

Pour que cela soit juste, il faudrait aussi que l'Etat arr√™te toute n√©gociation avec le MEDEF. Il y a des f√©d√©rations patronales √† chaque secteur (la tristement c√©l√®bre UIMM par exemple) et √ßa suffit amplement.

Pour les grands groupes, l'obligation d'avoir des salari√©s au conseil d'administration est une √©vidence. Je sais que c'√©tait √©voqu√©, je sais plus o√π √ßa en est. Ca devrait √™tre une obligation √† partir du moment ou ton groupe est cot√© en Bourse, par exemple.

Il faut aussi favoriser les SCOP plus qu'elles ne le sont d√©j√† - OK, √ßa marche pas toujours, comme pour Lejaby, mais dans le fond c'est un bon syst√®me, je pense.

Apr√®s, il y a des choses √† faire, mais je ne sais pas comment: Favoriser la mobilit√© g√©ographique des salari√©s, par exemple. Pousser √† fond les retraites par capitalisation avant que le syst√®me de r√©partition ne se casse la gueule. Cr√©er encore plus d'incentives fiscales et administratives pour les startups, et en adoptant un syst√®me d√©gressif; parce qu'actuellement une startup a des aides pendant X temps (un an, IIRC) et √ßa s'arr√™te d'un coup d√®s qu'on d√©passe la p√©riode. Beaucoup de startups ne peuvent pas tenir le choc.

TL;DR Scotland is not Nordic. It is, however, like them in many regards, even though it is very much more like England. Those differences don't necessarily matter if you have common interests and goals. Scotland and Nordic countries have those and so must, in some areas at least, cooperate. To do so, some institutional setting is required. The Nordic Union would be good enough, even if it would risk the name being slightly inaccurate on a cultural basis.

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"&gt; left-hand traffic

I'll grant you the rest, but here's the thing about the traffic:

Pretty much all of Europe used to drive on the left. In most non-French speaking countries, this was all the way until about 70 years ago. [In this clip from 1936](http://youtu.be/BVp3U_tteZg?t=3m47s), you can clearly see Vienna driving on the left. [A little bit later](http://youtu.be/BVp3U_tteZg?t=8m45s), you can see Budapest driving on the left as well. Most of Italy did until the late '20s. [Here is Madrid](http://youtu.be/6ifDR6jw1LY?t=7m) on the left somewhere around 1920. Portugal switched in 1928 or thereabouts. [Here is someone driving in Sweden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68hmcXVxyA4) in 1967 before they switched.

In short, there are many reasons why most of the world originally drove on the left; some natural, some arbitrary. With few exceptions, most of Europe now drives on the right because of either Napoleon or Hitler. Being an island with a historically badass navy, the UK was not particularly affected by either, so there's no incentive to switch. Now that the infrastructure is so developed that most motorway junctions and roundabouts would need to be rebuilt, there's no point now.

I'll give you a point on not using the metric system, though (although the UK is basically about 95% metric, it's just all the invisible stuff in the background. Signs are about the only thing left that aren't, and even then, most of the time they *are* metric, and the imperial measurements are a lie).

The fact that, by your own admission, you example was not of people wanting to immigrate into a former colonial power seeking a better life, but of people wanting to reclaim land that they feel belongs to their nation.

&gt; I recognize it, I simply don't frame it in the ridiculous way you do by pretending a border agreement somehow relates to your internal identity matters.

I have never brought up any question of internal identity or any such thing.

&gt; It is very much the same as far as the rest of Europe is concerned.

Again, no: there are linguistic, cultural and legal differences between the two cases. You are entitled to believe there shouldn't be any, but there *are*. This is a fact: a Brazilian and a Vietnamese immigrant to Portugal *are not in the same situation*. To reiterate: what you believe *should* be the case and what currently *is* the case are two different things, and I am *not* saying that you should believe anything else, only that the current situation is what it is.

edit: forgot to reply to the last line

&gt; If you want any special treatment for them you can pay for it out of your own pocket and in your own land.

Of course, you are entitled to this opinion. It doesn't change the fact that several countries belonging to the Schengen area *will* give special treatment to immigrants from former colonies and *the system currently being what it is*, even if you don't like it, makes that a matter that everybody has to deal with. Again, I am not saying you should just accept the system and be ok with it, only that you shouldn't deny that the problem *currently* does not just sit in the lap of former colonial powers.

2. ""Propagate your genes"" might be in the back of our brains, but most of our brains is (hopefully) full of other stuff. You can decide to use your life to make a perfect circle or to write an excellent book that will make the reader reconsider their life, and both are great and extremely valid purposes. 

3. The curious thing about your argument is that you have apparently decided that there isn't God and as such there can't be purpose. As you were a kid who needs to be validated by a parent for it to have meaning! How very ridiculous. Surely whatever we decide is worth doing IS worth doing, otherwise we wouldn't be doing it in the first place?

Note, that this same logic also casts out any claim FYROM has.  There is absolutely no way FYROM can be considered a continuation of the Kingdom of Macedonia which died in 149BC.

sagen wir mal so, ich diskutiere gern und viel √ºber die Gr√ºnde und ob das tats√§chlich Gr√ºnde sind. Ich muss daher auch etwas korrigieren. Eine Person konnte mir tats√§chlich einmal einen Grund nennen: Sein Kind (8 Jahre alt, zum damaligen Zeitpunkt) von der Schule abholen und nach Hause fahren. Die n√§chste Bushaltestelle bei der Wohnung ist 2 'gro√üe' Stra√üen entfernt und die Gegend in der er damals wohnte war nicht sehr vertrauenserweckend. 

Ich kann gern auch Gr√ºnde nennen warum man kein Privatfahrzeug ben√∂tigt: Es gibt S/U-Bahn, Busse, Fahrr√§der und Z√ºge. Desweiteren haben die meisten Personen 2 mehr oder weniger gesunde Beine. Damit kommt man wunderbar (zumindest in HH) zu so gut wie jedem Arbeitsplatz (oder anderem Ort).

F√ºr ein KFZ sprechen eigentlich nur, innerhalb einer annehmbaren Zeit von A nach B zu kommen und/oder sperrige/viele Dinge zu transportieren. Punkt 1 f√§llt damit in einer Gro√üstadt direkt weg. Punkt 2 k√∂nnte man relativ leicht durch 'Car sharing'-Angebote aushebeln, bei denen Autos mit einem vern√ºnftigen Kofferraum angeboten werden und nicht diese d√§mlichen Smarts.

Und was hast du dauernd mit deinen Spontandemos?! Darum geht es doch √ºberhaupt nicht. Mal ganz davon abgesehen das man auch einen durch Autos verursachten Stau auf einer Strecke wo man mit dem Rad auf der Stra√üe f√§hrt als 'k√ºnstliche Blockade' bezeichnen k√∂nnte, schlie√ülich hat ein Stau immer eine Ursache und die liegt bei einem KFZ Stau nunmal bei mindestens einem Auto/LKW Fahrer.

Nat√ºrlich halte ich mich an die Verkehrsregeln (zumindest die, die ich kenne), leider tuen dies viele (vorallendingen Radfahrer) nicht. Allerdings, zumindest in HH, ist die Verkehrsf√ºhrung f√ºr Radfahrer, vorallendingen in der n√§he von Baustellen, oft un√ºbersichtlich. Da muss dringend dran gearbeitet werden.

Believe me, it isn't, certainly not at all as in the US. IPCom, which is mentioned in the article, isn't a patent troll either: it sits on a bunch of important telecom patents once filed by Bosch. IPCom bought those patents from Bosch when the latter left the telecom field, helping it recoup its past investment in R&amp;D. Now it wants to recoup **its own** investment. Nothing particularly wrong with that, it is in fact how the patent system is supposed to work, even if the companies sued by IPCom may feel otherwise.

As for the opening of the article, it relates to the upcoming European Unified Patent Court system. Its future rules of procedure are just being drafted and everybody and his dog is lobbying to try to bend them in their own direction. Hence the crocodile tears of large IT corps who aren't just afraid of genuine patent trolls, but of any small patent owner whose patent rights they may be infringing.

&gt; That creates a huge disincentive, I will give you that. It also disincentivizes small patent owners suing large infringers. 

It depends. When legal costs are reasonable, even a ""loser pays"" rule won't discourage a small patent owner with what he sees as a genuine claim. The trouble in the US is that, as I say, legal costs in patent cases are astronomical (I've heard of multimillion dollar figures). As a consequence, both small defendants **and** small patent owners are discouraged from standing their ground in court. Before ""loser pays"" applies, you need to win, and you'll hardly win if you run out of money already at the outset.

The irony is that the main reason for these costs in US litigation is the acribious discovery process, which is intended to ensure fairness. In most other countries, discovery in civil cases is much more limited, in the interest of expediency.

Who you are culturally more similar with doesn't really matter. 

As an example where Nordic countries have intersests in common with us that they don't share with England, the north sea fish stocks. Now, that's an EU competence but they've kind of made a hash of it. With Norway, Iceland, the Faroes and such sharing the North Sea with us, we need to cooperate together so that we don't inadvertantly destroy the fish stocks. 

In terms of oil, Norway and Scotland have things to cooperate on that are absolutely no business of the EU. 

In terms of being small countries trying to make their interests heard within the EU, we all have, or would have, something in common. 

Now, we could muddle through with ad hoc negotiations. Try and discuss things within the EU, but be over ruled by larger nations. Or, we could institutionalise it somehow on our own terms. That might involve the creation of a second institution or the minor repurposing of a standing one. The later, I think, probably makes more sense. It's not asking to be rebranded Nordic or Scandinavian, it's just the most practical adaption to a changing world. And no one is saying only work with Scotland, merely presenting a practical way to do so. 

If you think that it is a widely inappropriate venue, then that's fine. We need to come up with a separate one. To not do so would be too detrimental.

true,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"It's particularly underhanded to, when someone says that they are about to become silent, declare that their silence will be taken as them acknowledging you are right. That's the only reason I've decided to answer, ebcause I don't think you're right. Anyway...

There are none so blind as those who will not see. That's you. You won't see. I tell you 'I'm not claiming to be Nordic, though it's true that we are more similar to you than the English are for x,y, and z'. And I then say that it doesn't particularly matter. The culture isn't the driving force behind the need to cooperate, it's our common interets i.e. x, y, and z. You say 'but the culture....we're much more like dem dar germans.' And I say, the cultural aspects of it are only one part. There are other, more important ones. 

Those interests are largely shared with the Icelandics, Norwegians and Danes but the Finns, and Swedes also share common interests with us. Unless we want to accept sub-optimal outcomes in those areas of common itnerets, we should cooperate. That you all cooperate with Scotland, which is as much in your interests as it is in ours, does not preclude you cooperating with Germany, or the Netherlands. In fact, I actively encourage you to cooperate with them in whatever the most appropriate forum is. I imagine you're close to that already, given the length of time you've existed together as indepdendent countries. I don't know what those arrangments are, and don't care to look them up as it's a bit of a red herring in this case, but there are fairly good reasons, beyond culture which you seem to be entirely focusses on for some bizarre reason, for them not to be involved in the Nordic union. Size, alternative cooperative aggrements like Benelux, and so on make it not the best forum for your multilateral interactions. 

In Scotland's case, its circumstances would be dramatically altered by independence. It will need to join and create new institutions to cooperate with othercountries. Due to the nature of Scotland's geography and assets, it particularly needs to cooperate with the Nordic countries and, hell, they need to cooperate with Scotland too. Scotland is a natural ally and friend of those countries. Given that we should be cooperating, it should be institutionalised in someway, rather than on a sub-optimal ad hoc basis. Whether that be by the creation of a separate council, with a tonne of duplication, and some boring name like North Sea Natural Resources Council for Cooperation, or in an already established venue is what we're discussing. I would very much hope that we're not discussing even the need to cooperate. 

I, personally, think that the Nordic Council is the best venue. You're, of course, free to disagree. The idea that it sets a bad precedent for other relations, or that the cultural aspect of the council is so great, that it cannot be made to work well is, in my mind, a bit myopic.

I understand you. You want an independent Scotland and then a closer cooperation with the Nordic countries since you think it would benefit you (and us).  I also assume that you like some aspects of our culture. And- it would enhance your independence, which I assume is a part of it. I don't really agree with your close cultural assessment but we can let that slide. 

But you didn't answer my question.!!!! It is becoming frustrating that you are refusing to answer it, just avoiding it!  

We (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland) are Nordic. We have a unique Nordic identity which you claim that you Scots  are very close to, thus we should be part of some very close union/council. I also assume that you want to keep it democratic, like we Nordic countries have.  

Then, if we let the Scots in, it really works and say the Germans, the Dutch and the Baltic states would want to join- we can not refuse them. The are, far, far closer to us than you are, but that would mean that all 24 million of us Nordics would be far, far outnumbered and it would be no more Nordic. Don't you see that? It would be something Northern European which of course then if it worked would mean that if successfull, Belgium, Poland, England, Ireland, France and possibly Austria would be let in. How much Nordic would that be? 

So please, stop trying to avoid to answer the question! If we, as Nordic countries open to non Nordic countries we would quickly be outnumbered and the Nordic aspect which we cherish would disappear. So either you explain why we Nordics should abandon our cooperation in favour of some vague Northern European Union/council *or*you explain why Scotland as only country, above Germany and the Netherlands and Estonia should be let in.  Because I do not see how we, politically, democratically it anything can work with you, but not the Dutch or the Germans. As I see it, if we let the Scots in, we have opened the floodgates to ruin everything Nordic. The Germans bloody lives Scandinavia, they'll jump on any chance with a deeper cooperation, not to mention the Dutch will always perk up, works fine with their increasing non EU sentiments as well. 

And stop trying to avoid the issue. I notice that you don't want to answer. So answer me. From the Nordics view- why should we only let Scotland in? And if, how would you explain that to the Germans, Baltic States and the Dutch? If you can't explain that- why should we open ourselves to not be Nordic anymore? Just because the Scots want in, we should abandon the Nordic council and go for something Northern European?

Wake up and small the coffee ... Europe IS WEAK. The article says ""Western weakness emboldens Putin"" and it is completely right.

And no this is not the definition of an alliance. It is the definition of an unbalanced and flawed alliance when one side doesn't bother their arses and depends almost entirely on the other side. It ends up not an alliance, but a dependency culture and it's about time we in Europe stepped up and became self reliant a bit more in terms of military capability, especially now that we have an aggressive expansionist Russia back on our doorstep.

&gt;but why didn't he say that Europe should invest in renewable energy and nuclear energy instead of saying ""buy it from the US""? Is it because he doesn't care about Europe?

Why should he ? It's not his job to manage Europe. It's his job to promote the US. And right now Europe doesn't have much choice.

Your anti American rhetoric is a lot more evident than anything negative the article says about Russia.

Good to know. How does that support your argument?

Read this:

&gt; ""A deodorant is a substance applied to the body to prevent body odor caused by the bacterial breakdown of perspiration in armpits, feet, and other areas of the body.""

That taken straight from the Wikipedia article I linked to before. Deodorants don't have to be scented, especially, even though I can't believe I still have to repeat this, because ""DEODORANT"" IS THE SUPERORDINATE TERM. Antiperspirants are deodorants. Both prevent body odour, with the difference that antiperspirants also prevent sweating itself. Still, it's a subgroup and my original statement does in no way suggest that antiperspirants are an invalid choice.

Die pauschalierende Kritik an einem nicht verstandenen Werk, aufgrund einer oder weniger Aussagen, ist deshalb auch nicht glaubhaft.

Bildhaft gesprochen wird dann das Kinde mit dem Bade ausgesch√ºttet, oder eben das gesamte Buch verbrannt aufgrund einer unbeliebten Passage.

Ein sehr gutes und immer wieder bem√ºhtes Beispiel ist die Rezeption von Nietzsches Werk.

In seinem *Also sprach Zarathustra* stehen solche Dinge wie:

&gt; Du gehst zu Frauen? Vergiss die Peitsche nicht!

und Vieles andere mehr.

Aber im selben Buch postuliert er nur 20 Jahre nach Darwin, dass Gott tot sei.

K√∂nnte man glaubhaft aufgrund einzelner Passagen ganze Werke kritisieren, h√§tte es Nietzsche geschafft, sich mit zwei S√§tzen ann√§hernd 100% seiner Leserschaft zu vergraulen - n√§mlich die Zielgruppe der Frauen und die der gl√§ubigen M√§nner.

Und deshalb gilt auch: Man kann nicht, oder nur schwierig, wie du schreibst, ein komplettes Werk glaubhaft kritisieren, wenn man es nicht kennt.

Those similarities are also more numberous between us and the nordics, than between England and the nordics. The similarities, however, are more numerous between Scotland and England. I do not think that, however, is particularly relevent. They're close enough for the differences not to have a meaningful impact on our ability to cooperate with you and them. 

&gt;we have opened the floodgates to ruin everything Nordic.

You don't necessarily have to open the 'floodgates'. Germany won't be offended by you saying 'We are 24+5 million people, and we're working on some slightly different things, our current network of ties serves us well enough, there's no need to change'. For that matter, neither will the Netherlands be. My answer to your question is, unless the Nordic Councils main purpose is to only ever work in the best interestes of the Nordics, and not anyone else ever, absolutely, we can do nothing else cause culture must be pure, screw the negative effects on anything else, it won't be a problem becasue primarily, 1) you already have ties with those countries and 2) there are relatively good reasons that you can use to say no. 

Let me turn the question around on you now. You cooperate with Germany. You cooperate with the Netherlands. You cooperate with Estonia. You cooperate with virutally every nation on Earth. How would you cooperate with an Independent Scotland. Not doing so is not an option. Mismangement of fisheries, mismanagement of shipping lanes, etc. etc. etc. are not in the slightest desirable. 

There are a number of options that could be pursued. Given I do not think your 'problem' with the Nordic Union is really a problem, and duplication from setting up a stand alone institution like the Scotto-Nordic Council would be undesirable, I believe that Scotland joining the Nordic Council, is one of the better routes that could be pursued. 

&gt; Just because the Scots want in

No, just becasue it's probably in your best interests. IT's not without its cons, but then nothing is. You seem to be evaluating the cost without making any comparisons to other alternatives. It's like going to Madeuplandia and asking how much something costs, then saying 'sounds expensive' when you don't know what the SEK-MadeUpPounds conversion is. 


(And btw, 5 million Scots cooperating over fisheries, or oil, or regulations, is not going to destroy Nordic culture. Christ on a mechanical fucking bicycle, could you be more alarmist. Yes, is the answer. You could be George 'forces of darkness' Robertson. Acorrding to him, an Independent Scotland wil destroy western civilization.)",0,1398539734,null,0,false,0,ch2qjen,t3_240kxd,t1_ch2qjen,t1_ch2pjpl,null,1433533035,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

That's rotten justification and based on assumption.

&gt;Colonialism brought education, infrastructure and modern medicine to the colonized.

And that couldn't have been brought otherwise? Colonialism also brought exploitation, slavery, war, mutilation, and foreign domination. The vast majority of native wealth left the territory for the homeland of their European overlords. 

And some infrastructure it brought, African has fuck all in the way of infrastructure.

&gt;The problems in their home countries can't be solved by moving in droves to Europe.

But their lives can be dramatically improved.

&gt;All their capable people leave, living conditions continue to backslide, and they continue to complain about the evil white man. 

Because the problems are rooted in what we have done. They may not be able to blame you or me, but Europe is very central in the causes to their shitty lives. Not just from our colonial past, but from continued exploitation through corporate means.

&gt; Nothing gets solved and they will forever be accusing you of historical oppression.

Because we did historically oppress them. Claiming we didn't is revisionist in the extreme.

&gt;The British Empire did a lot of underhanded things to the Chinese. The Chinese are doing much better these days. Do you think they would have made such a comeback if they all decided to leave when things were tough?

Eh, wow. 

Firstly, saying China is ""doing OK"" is a dramatic stretch. It's doing ""OK"" off the mass exploitation of its own people.

Secondly, China was never colonially dominated to the extent to the extent of Africa, where most of these immigrants are coming from.

Thirdly, shit tonnes of Chinese people left the country whenever possible. 

China has made a comeback through the resumption of Colonial policies, except it is mass exploitation of their own people and working class as opposed to foreign natives. And even with this, they are barely holding things together with very serious problems occurring on *many* levels.

1. I don't own Hausschuhe

2. Well, I like long breakfasts, but I also like being lazy, so I just eat a little bit of bread with marmelade. Also M√ºsli.

3. Ok, sometimes I actually do that.

4. I have never spoken with an insurance advisor in my life. But I do have some insurances.

5. Well, I always carry my Regenschirm with me, and try to dress according to the weather of the last few days...

6. I'm actually speaking deutsch in my everyday life!

7. Should I ever manage to get through university, I won't make people address me as Dr. Invisible, who besides doctors (√Ñrzte, you know what I mean) does that?

8. That's exactly what I do. Even when the road is empty, this is spot on.

9. Actually, I fear every beverage that does fizz. I just don't like it. I only drink tap water.

10. Yup, meat is noce, allthough I'm not *that* fond of Wurst.

11. I'll out myself at this point: I *hate* Sauerkraut. I can't stand it. I wouldn't even use it as Lametta.

12. I'm more like ""What the hell do you do there"" than ""That's not really a job"".

13. Never ever have I opened a beer bottle...

14. I like the direct approach, you can't do it wrong like the more social approach other countries seem to have.

15. Well, I don't know how I feel about Berlin. I don't think about it most of the time.

16. Oh yes, Bavaria...

17. I have no problem discussing sexuality, but I like to keep my own to myself.

18. I do not own a car and I'm not a car person.

19. I'd like to do nothing on sundays, but I know exactly that tomorrow, I'll be sweating over Festk√∂rperphysik.

20. I never even watched Tatort.

21. Oh I remember a vacation in England where we were shocked what was considered different sorts of bread in England: The same sort of bread, but in slices of differing thickness! We really missed bread.

22. I always sign with ""Mit freundlichen Gr√º√üen"", at least in professional e-mails, until the people start to annoy me, then I gradually lower it. ""Mit vielen Gr√º√üen"", ""Viele Gr√º√üe"", ""Gr√º√üe""...

23. That really hits the nail on the head. Everybody does that. Everybody.

24. I hate Kartoffelsalat, but it's true, people bring it everywhere.

25. ""Warte, hatte ich dich schon?"" Yep, that happens.

So I guess I have to learn a lot, even though I'm on a good way. I've only gone around half of those 25 steps.

If the citizens of other countries (mine included) didn't directly vote for individual laws or treaties, it's because we chose representatives to do it, the exact same way your govenment doesn't create a referendum for every law they pass nationally. In countries like yours, where the population is so divided on these sorts of things, it's a nice gesture to do a referendum, but unless especifically coded into law, not something necessary. In these (like mine) ""other countires"" people aren't up in arms about it, and people who disagree will simply vote differently in the next election. The way democracy works.

Either way, even with your ""common sense"" explanation, it's  clear that your claim:

My point is that the good that came from colonialism is downplayed wherever possible. It's not the fault of Europeans that the Africans were too incompetent to maintain what we left behind.

My life can be dramatically improved if I were allowed to live in a mansion on a hill. So what? Bill Gates isn't obligated to let me move into his house. Europe is not obligated to take in the world's poor.

I never said we didn't. European countries aren't anywhere close to being the only ones who did this. Just about every country who was capable of exploiting foreigners has done so in its history. These people have no room to cast the first stone.

I think it's safer to assume they would've been better off without us raping their natural resources and stealing all their shit, but that's just me being crazy I guess.

&gt;My point is that the good that came from colonialism is downplayed wherever possible. 

It isn't downplayed, it's just marginal compared to the longterm harm that we have inflicted.

&gt;It's not the fault of Europeans that the Africans were too incompetent to maintain what we left behind.

Actually it is, in most colonial holdings we suppressed native education and had white Europeans do all the educated work. 

&gt;My life can be dramatically improved if I were allowed to live in a mansion on a hill. So what? Bill Gates isn't obligated to let me move into his house. Europe is not obligated to take in the world's poor.

I don't recall Bill Gates' cutting off your father's hands because he didn't meet his rubber quota.


&gt;Who is ""we""? Do you think I exploited millions of Asians and Africans? 

No, our nations, which believe it or not, are more than a generation old.

&gt;The practices of big business aren't the fault of the general population. These are a very small number of elites who operate with the complicity of Asian and African governments.

And done with the complicity of our nations as well as that of the general population, but this isn't the argument we are having. We are discussing the long term effects for colonial imperialism, which you are trivializing. 

&gt;I never said we didn't. European countries aren't anywhere close to being the only ones who did this. Just about every country who was capable of exploiting foreigners has done so in its history. These people have no room to cast the first stone.

Maybe, but we just happened to be the ones that were good at it and did it for far longer and objectively much more recently.

I dislike a lot of their current internal stuff, which is perhaps unsurprising. I don't like their lack of universal health care, the abysmal protection of workers, the stance towards guns, racial politics, anti-science politicians, and their first-past-the-post election system.

I really like the ideas that the country is founded on, it's one of the rare countries that was founded with the ideas of freedom and democracy. I like many concepts of governance and civil society that they have, the way their courts are supposed to work, the way their Supreme Court works, and the like. Above everything, I like their attitude towards freedom of speech. It can probably never be quite perfect, but I think the First Amendment is the greatest legal clause ever, along with how it's been interpreted by the SCOTUS (though I do not agree with all of the landmark rulings).

As for US intervention, I do not have a single stance on it all. Sometimes they intervened where they shouldn't have. Sometimes they didn't intervene where they should have. I realize pragmatically that the US can intervene almost anywhere for one important reason - they are by far the most powerful country militarily. It is probably inevitable that a country with such power will abuse it. Which the US does - I disagree with a lot of what they're doing in the War on Terror, and I think that it's really dangerous because it might undermine what the US is all about. That said, I would much rather see the US as a superpower than China, with its communitarian thinking, or than Russia, which has firmly slipped back into authoritarianism. With the US, I can expect them to sometimes intervene internationally for the right reasons.

1. The word 'soccer' was created in England
2. All football codes, be it association, American, rugby, Australian, etc. are equally deserving of the name football as they all trace their origin to the single game (set of games?) played in Britain since a very long time ago. In every country, the term 'football' is used to mean the most common code in that country. In most of Europe, when you say football, you mean soccer, when you want to refer to another code, you say e.g. American football. In US, football is American football and when they want to refer to association (European) football, they say soccer.

If you think there's something wrong with the word 'soccer', or if you think the world 'football' should be reserved for the association football, you don't know anything about the history of the sport.

And the next issue is that ""football"" clearly means association football in non-English speaking countries.

I've spent about three years total in England (and I've visited Wales and Scotland), and while I've heard that said, I don't agree.  Most Brits whom I've spoken to have cared more about political issues than Americans seem to.

The problem is that there seems to be a consensus that every political party and every politician is an absolute waste of space.  There is no faith in the ability of politicians to improve the country.  That's the problem: with the possible exception of UKIP inspiring the right-wing, there are no inspirational figures in UK politics.

tl;dr: It's not a lack of interest in politics, it's a lack of confidence in the political parties.

**Transportation:** if you stay in the city the public transportation is really good. You can use it to get to anywhere you may need. No car.

**Language:** with the levels of foreign tourism in this city I am sure you will be fine for all tourist related activities.

**Events:** I have been out of touch with meetups, but June 14 is global reddit meetup day, so I will assume something will happen. As for other city events, I am pretty sure someone else will have suggestions.

Now, to the location:

A note about security: Barcelona is a safer city than most people think, especially if you follow some really common sense rules. All possible incidents happen when you are distracted, so keep an eye on your belongings, do not leave your valuables outside of range or get so drunk you pass out on the street on your own. Simple stuff. The risk is concentrated in touristic areas, with pickpockets focused on easy targets. Just have some sense and you will be fine.

**Location:** Because of public transportation, most of the places in the inner city are ok to stay in. The airport is a little bit of, but is well communicated. There are buses that go from the terminals to Plaza Spanya and Plaza Catalunya and a train that goes to terminal 1 from Passeig de Gracia. If this is truly a priority I would search for places to stay near Plaza Catalunya. Very touristic so there are plenty of hotels and such.

Feel free to ask me anything else you may need. I am pretty sure other users can give much better suggestions than I can.",0,1398546079,null,0,false,0,ch2t0jp,t3_241xzl,t1_ch2t0jp,t3_241xzl,null,1433534202,2,false,Barcelona,t5_2qosg,2

true,12ToneRow,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;I think it's safer to assume they would've been better off without us raping their natural resources and stealing all their shit, but that's &gt;just me being crazy I guess.

Europe would have been better off without repeated muslim/Arab invasions and slave raids. Europe would have been better off without the Mongols and other assorted Asian marauders pillaging. But wait, the Europeans DID recover and we didn't have to immigrate in large numbers to the lands of former occupiers. You are claiming that we picked clean all the resources in places we colonized but that's not true at all. The vast untapped resources of Africa lay before them. 

&gt;It isn't downplayed, it's just marginal compared to the longterm harm that we have inflicted.

What exactly are they suffering from today that was caused by western colonization? Is it anything like the black Americans who claim to have PTSD as a result of slavery, which ended over 150 years ago?

&gt;Actually it is, in most colonial holdings we suppressed native education and had white Europeans do all the educated work. 

Even if what you claim is true, that just lays the blame on the ones who wanted Europe out. Did they at any point think, ""Hm, Most of us can't even read. Maintaining advanced irrigation systems(etc.) on our own probably isn't a good idea""? 

&gt;I don't recall Bill Gates' cutting off your father's hands because he didn't meet his rubber quota.

Likewise, the current generation of Europeans isn't responsible for what may have happened decades/centuries before they were born.

&gt;No, our nations, which believe it or not, are more than a generation old.

The question was asked in the video. How long are Europeans supposed to carry the weight of this indiscretion?

&gt;And done with the complicity of our nations as well as that of the general population, but this isn't the argument we are having. We are &gt;discussing the long term effects for colonial imperialism, which you are trivializing. 

Ah, but you did bring up the supposed exploitation being carried out post-colonialism. As if that was the fault of the general population.

&gt;Maybe, but we just happened to be the ones that were good at it and did it for far longer and objectively much more recently.

So because we did these things more recently, we should feel more guilty about it? Should young Germans feel guilty about the holocaust? They had nothing to do with that either. 

&gt;Not the point I'm making. You spoke as if China was somehow ""recovered"", which is a blatant falsehood.

They would have been better off without our meddling. The recent rise of China wouldn't have been possible if all their best and brightest left and never came back. 

Forgive me for poor formatting, by the way.

Getting from the airport is easier than anywhere I've experienced in North America (NYC is a close exception). From the airport, when you exit the arrivals area, the busses are located just downstairs one level. There are several signs, and info desks incase you have trouble finding it. If you are staying in the Raval/El Gotic area, you will get the [A1 bus](http://www.aerobusbcn.com/index.php/en/lines.html) and get off in Placa Catalunya. 

Your english will be fine, as long as you stay in touristy areas. I had trouble initially when I was getting out into the residential areas, and english was few and far between. This turned out to be a godsend as it forced me to improve my Spanish instead of relying on others' english. If you already know, or can learn a handful words and phrases like 'who, what, where, when' as well as 'how much?', 'where is?' and understanding basic numbers, like 1-20. Other than that, jut go out and have fun and if you struggle with anything or directions, look for the most beautiful spanish girl and ask her. Chances are, her english will be decent enough, and she'll get excited to speak to you!",0,1398547081,null,0,false,0,ch2teur,t3_241xzl,t1_ch2teur,t3_241xzl,null,1433534392,5,false,Barcelona,t5_2qosg,5

You are claiming that we picked clean all the resources in places we colonized but that's not true at all. The vast untapped resources of Africa lay before them.

Um, that wasn't Colonialism. At all.

Firstly, Mongol ""rule"" in Europe was mostly confined to raids and demanding tribute. They didn't settle and they never went further West than Hungary. They were far too busy fighting themselves.

Seondly, the Muslims did not colonize Iberia. They migrated and settled in the region and created their own sultanates and caliphates. There's a distinct difference between conquering with migration, and colonialism where the only goal is to strip the region of resources useful to the overlord, regardless of the conditions of the native population. The conflict between warring Kingdoms of roughly equal capability in the Medieval Era is supremely different to the domination of less civilized nations later on.

Thirdly, Spain and Portugal were major Colonial Powers and their strength can largely be derived from their exploitation of their colonial holdings. So using them as a prime example is extremely misleading.

&gt;What exactly are they suffering from today that was caused by western colonization? Is it anything like the black Americans who claim to have PTSD as a result of slavery, which ended over 150 years ago?

Are you one of those Americans that claims that blacks today are not suffering at all from the effects of past American discrimination? Because you sound like one of those types.

There are very real, present problems left over from the Colonization period of Africa, which only *sort of* ended in 1980, with continued European involvement in the affairs of African sovreignty thereafter. 

So, your attitude of Colonialism being some sort of distant, passed issue is not only incredibly ignorant, it's trivializing and insulting to boot.

To make it simple for you, problems such as wanton corruption, abysmal education, wars, ethnic conflict, and wealth leaving the country are extremely present issues that are resultant of European colonialism, and American neocolonialism during the Cold War. 

&gt;Even if what you claim is true, that just lays the blame on the ones who wanted Europe out. Did they at any point think, ""Hm, Most of us can't even read. Maintaining advanced irrigation systems(etc.) on our own probably isn't a good idea""?


There's not ""even if"" about it, I am factually correct, your stance is factually incorrect. Pick up a history book. 

On top of this, what you are saying is amount to victim blaming, it's arrogant to the extreme to assume people should not want to govern themselves because their colonial overlords are handicapping them in their ability to do so, and this is directly contradictory to the right of self-determination as granted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

&gt;Ah, but you did bring up the supposed exploitation being carried out post-colonialism. As if that was the fault of the general population.

Again, you throw around the word ""supposed"" as if what I am saying is questionable. It is a reality that corporations of various national origins are exploiting Africa for its natural resources, and it is in the name of these corporate interests that many European interventions have been made, the most classic example being the Secession of Katanga in 1960.

&gt;Likewise, the current generation of Europeans isn't responsible for what may have happened decades/centuries before they were born.

Again, the nations are, as these are the same nations today that existed then, only in a more evolved(or devolved, depending on where you stand) state. The United Kingdom is the British Empire. Portugal is Portugal and Belgium is Belgium.

&gt;The question was asked in the video. How long are Europeans supposed to carry the weight of this indiscretion?

For an indefinite period of time. We are the root cause for many of the problems plaguing these nations, when those problems have been solved and we show genuine good will to act in *their* interests instead of our own, when it comes to the problems in the region, then we can start talking about absolving ourselves. In historical terms, this was yesterday.

&gt;Ah, but you did bring up the supposed exploitation being carried out post-colonialism. As if that was the fault of the general population.

We buy their products, we don't give a fuck about the conditions that our things are made in as long as we get them. Our consumerist society directly lends itself to corporate exploitation of post-colonial states. We implicitly support their actions through purchasing of their goods. One would think that's not really the fault of the consumer, but the utter indifference amongst the general population as to the origin of their goods would, indeed, make us partially responsible. 

&gt;So because we did these things more recently, we should feel more guilty about it? Should young Germans feel guilty about the holocaust? They had nothing to do with that either.

The German nation had everything to do with the Holocaust. It's current population has not. There is a distinct difference. Germany as a nation is absolutely responsible for the Holocaust and Israel, the nation which was formed as a result, has forged relations anew with them.    
I doubt, however, the Palestinian people would feel so forgiving towards the Germans with the knowledge that their land and home was taken from them because some Germans decided it was a fantastic idea to commit genocide. But I digress.

No, the people of Germany should not feel any specific guilt about the Holocaust, but the nation of Germany should remember its obligations to the people which it has effected - namely the Jews and the Arabs who have been displaced in order to make space for a Jewish nation.

Then theres fraudulent wars like Iraq that were based on lies to pass a lucrative agenda, and then not even going to our congress to start a war (thanks Obama). I don't like how the US gov sticks their nose into almost every conflict in the middle east.

And then theres the fact that almost every elected official is a corporatist shill, and this plays into our foreign policy, oil policy, ect. 

And then there's all the pandering in congress, and the *many* feel good gun laws on both the federal and state level, and the stances on marijuana and even gay marriage.

I really like our constitution, and I'm very fond of the values we were based on, but feel as if we are drifting away from both these because our government doesn't really give a shit. I'm sure there's a bit I'm missing here.

Germany didn't have a hand in it's creation if any nation did it was Britain, but even they were backing out of that notions early after the Declaration and only really pulled out of the area after sustained nationalist zionist terrorism towards their officials and the UN Partition Plan failing due to the surrounding Arab nations refusing it and threatening war should it be implemented.

There are problems though; most of which are due to our immigrants not coming from a neighbouring country whose culture we can relate to easily, but from countries which are continents apart and they arrive in such large numbers that conflict arises. 

When people arrive in these numbers they don't have to integrate as they can find employment and social interaction within their own community. When this happens, especially when making government social and foreign policy  there there are problems as the view of the native population rarely fits the view of the immigrant population. Accommodating the immigrants view in government causes shifts in the politics of the native population (normally to the right) because they feel that their morals/principles are being changed to accommodate people who moved to this country of their own free will.

true,12ToneRow,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;Um, that wasn't Colonialism. At all.

Funny, I don't remember saying that it was.

&gt;Firstly, Mongol ""rule"" in Europe was mostly confined to raids and demanding tribute. They didn't settle and they never went further West than &gt;Hungary. They were far too busy fighting themselves.

They were responsible for bringing the plague to Europe. 

&gt;Seondly, the Muslims did not colonize Iberia. They migrated and settled in the region and created their own sultanates and caliphates. There's a &gt;distinct difference between conquering with migration, and colonialism where the only goal is to strip the region of resources useful to the &gt;overlord, regardless of the conditions of the native population. The conflict between warring Kingdoms of roughly equal capability in the Medieval &gt;Era is supremely different to the domination of less civilized nations later on.

So numerous slave raids, land grabs, and centuries of foreign occupation were all just quaint settlements in our neighborhoods? Are you saying that they didn't exploit us economically?

&gt;Are you one of those Americans that claims that blacks today are not suffering at all from the effects of past American discrimination? 

What's funny is the fact that they're not. They have benefited from their ancestors' enslavement. They enjoy the same rights as whites do, and they get a leg up in education and the job market through affirmative action. They get to enjoy the conveniences of the western world while their relatives in Africa have drastically lower living standards. 

&gt;To make it simple for you, problems such as wanton corruption, abysmal education, wars, ethnic conflict, and wealth leaving the country are &gt;extremely present issues that are resultant of European colonialism, and American neocolonialism during the Cold War. 

Sorry to say, but Africa south of the Sahara has been a dump for the last 6000 years of recorded history. It's not the white man's fault that they slaughter each other and commit mass indiscriminate rape. Not being able to read doesn't cause someone to burn their neighbors alive. 

&gt;On top of this, what you are saying is amount to victim blaming, it's arrogant to the extreme to assume people should not want to govern &gt;themselves because their colonial overlords are handicapping them in their ability to do so, and this is directly contradictory to the right of      &gt;self-determination as granted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 

And we did allow them to govern themselves. Just because their standard of living fell post-colonialism doesn't obligate us to let them all come to Europe.

&gt;It is a reality that corporations of various national origins are exploiting Africa for its natural resources, and it is in the name of these corporate &gt;interests that many European interventions have been made, the most classic example being the Secession of Katanga in 1960.

And? This exploitation is not endorsed by the European governments nor is the general population responsible for it. If those nations want restitution, they should get it from the companies that exploited them. And again, it is the leadership of these exploited places that allows it to happen in the first place. 

&gt;For an indefinite period of time. We are the root cause for many of the problems plaguing these nations, when those problems have been solved &gt;and we show genuine good will to act in their interests instead of our own, when it comes to the problems in the region, then we can start talking &gt;about absolving ourselves. In historical terms, this was yesterday.

How about those that exploited Europe then? Should we continue to make them pay for their past sins indefinitely? The west already supplies most of these nations with food/monetary aid. Some countries I'm sure, only remain solvent because of the aid we give. Where would you draw the line?

&gt;Again, the nations are, as these are the same nations today that existed then, only in a more evolved(or devolved, depending on where you &gt;stand) state. The United Kingdom is the British Empire. Portugal is Portugal and Belgium is Belgium.

A nation is it's people. And these people have nothing to do with the sins of the past. Who's really bearing the cost of making amends? It's not ""nations"". It's people.

&gt;One would think that's not really the fault of the consumer, but the utter indifference amongst the general population as to the origin of their &gt;goods would, indeed, make us partially responsible. 

It takes two to tango. No one is making them accept such working conditions. If someone is, it certainly isn't your average Brit. 

&gt;No, the people of Germany should not feel any specific guilt about the Holocaust, but the nation of Germany should remember its obligations to the &gt;people which it has effected - namely the Jews and the Arabs who have been displaced in order to make space for a Jewish nation. 

But Germany wasn't responsible for the establishment of Israel, which impacted the people already living there.

true,ClitDoctorMD,IREL,Ireland,"&gt; Are you familiar with how a democracy works? People choose representatives, and the representatives make the decisions.

Yes I am but people vote for national representatives on the basis of national issues, not european ones. People only vote for their MEPs based on european issues. So when a referendum comes up eg the fiscal treaty that wasnt drawn up when the nearest national election took place how can you say the government adequately represent people's views on it? 

&gt;In countries like yours, where the population is so divided on these sorts of things, it's a nice gesture to do a referendum

Firstly its not a gesture its a legally obliged under our constitution. In my country 3/4 of the main parties in my country back every treaty. People vote them in on national policy not european ones so on the surface the fact that around 80% of our parliament a pro EU would lead you to believe every EU treaty would be passed no problem. However they dont, they regularly get rejected. Now are you honestly saying had the citizens in every member state gotten a vote that their collective vote would match their governments?

The answer is quite simple.

I take it you are not largely familiar with Israel's founding history then. The majority of it's zionist inhabitants came to the area out of highly religious orthodox beliefs or highly communist russian jewish nationalist ones. Even their early leaders like [Chaim Weizmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Weizmann) made it very clear that ""suffering was never the wellspring of zionism but the desire for a national centre and a national life"" [paraphrased].

While the German oppressions saw some influx of jews to the area due to deals between Nazi Germany and certain zionist organizations at the time these were largely stopped due to the requests of the local Arab leaders such as [Haj Amin al-Husseini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haj_Amin_al-Husseini). 

&gt;For sure the groundwork was laid for its foundation but it was the extremely large influx of European Jews prior to and after the war that lead to the 1948 declaration that founded Israel. 

Not really, in terms of population the jews in the area were a very small minority even in 1948 and owned only a fraction of the land. It was their continued armed efforts murdering British politicians and UN mediators (including [one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folke_Bernadotte) who had saved many thousands from the camps) that led to the state's creation by Britain tactly removing their mandate from the area without handing it over to anyone, leaving political room for zionist nationalists to proclaim a state.

The United States at war was what was able to create a true melting pot, but it must be noted that before the World Wars the United States was far from nationally unified. 

The united states has regularly discriminated against every single nationality of the world and only relatively recently developed a strong national identity. The Irish were especially discriminated in places such as boston and chicago, Germans were also on the receiving end of a lot of spite, immigration of asian peoples were until recently limited and when they were allowed in they were often forced to do hard labor such as in the building of the transcontinental railroad, Africans are the most well-famous of discriminated groups, Jews were despised until WWII when the U.S. tried to absolve themselves by sponsoring a jewish state, religious groups have always been persecuted including Catholics and Protestants, If you're familiar with Upton Sinclair's ""the Jungle"" then you know of the plight of the lithuanians‚Ä¶ Only recently has a person's distant ethnic/cultural past been cool to display.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"&gt; Funny, I don't remember saying that it was.

We were discussing Colonialism. You brought up the Muslim invasion of Europe. It isn't hard to see why I would assume that's what you were inferring. If you're not saying it's Colonialism then I don't see how it belongs in this conversation.

&gt;They were responsible for bringing the plague to Europe.

But not responsible for Colonialism. Which is what we are discussing. Disease is different to Colonialism. 

&gt;So numerous slave raids, land grabs, and centuries of foreign occupation were all just quaint settlements in our neighborhoods? Are you saying that they didn't exploit us economically?

I'm saying it's nothing compared to Colonialism. Slavery was a two way street, Christians sold captured Muslims into slavery during the Reconquista. Due to the fact those people had then been living there for a sum total of 700 years, would you call that economic exploitation, or just simply the spoils of war?

&gt;How about those that exploited Europe then? 

Such as?

&gt;The west already supplies most of these nations with food/monetary aid. Some countries I'm sure, only remain solvent because of the aid we give. Where would you draw the line?

Actual foreign direct investment as opposed to simply handing over a few billion to a government as long as they tow your line, because make no mistake that aid money doesn't go to all post-colonial states, just the ones that do what we like.

&gt;Sorry to say, but Africa south of the Sahara has been a dump for the last 6000 years of recorded history. It's not the white man's fault that they slaughter each other and commit mass indiscriminate rape. Not being able to read doesn't cause someone to burn their neighbors alive.

You should pick up a history book sometime, it might fix that problem of yours.

You know, the blinding stupidity and all that.

&gt;What's funny is the fact that they're not. They have benefited from their ancestors' enslavement. They enjoy the same rights as whites do, and they get a leg up in education and the job market through affirmative action. They get to enjoy the conveniences of the western world while their relatives in Africa have drastically lower living standards.

If I get stabbed and you take the knife out of me am I suddenly all better?

Because I'm seeing a trend in your comments, and in general you're just full of shit. I'm not sure if you're willfully ignorant, a little racist, or just incredibly short sighted, but you cannot seem to comprehend that there is such a thing as knock-on effects, lasting damage, or that once someone stops doing something that it does not mean they're absolved of all responsibility. 

Do you think that the blacks have twice the unemployment simply because they're lazy and like living off welfare? Or maybe it's because there's fuck all educational investment in working class areas. 


&gt;And? This exploitation is not endorsed by the European governments nor is the general population responsible for it. If those nations want restitution, they should get it from the companies that exploited them. And again, it is the leadership of these exploited places that allows it to happen in the first place.

Um, if you knew jack shit about Colonialism, Africa, or the world and history in general, you'd know this is blatantly false.  

For example, it was the Belgium Army fighting in the Congo on the behalf of corporate interests. So, yes, the state does endorse this.  


&gt;And we did allow them to govern themselves. Just because their standard of living fell post-colonialism doesn't obligate us to let them all come to Europe.

The relationship between the colonized and the colonials is like a home owner and a thief. The thief has all of your shit but you still want him to get the fuck out of your house. At the end of it all you have nothing left. Is it your fault?

&gt;A nation is it's people. And these people have nothing to do with the sins of the past. Who's really bearing the cost of making amends? It's not ""nations"". It's people.

A nation is an institution, not a person or group of people. It's a piece of land with a set border and a governing body that acts on policy, policies and laws often inherited from previous iterations of government. 

When a person dies, all their good things disappear. Their good health, whatever, it's gone. A nation retains the good things from one government to another, from one generation to another. 

The wealth they took went into the state and matters of the state, which the state benefited from and as such, successive generations of people living in that state benefit from that same exploitation.


&gt;It takes two to tango. No one is making them accept such working conditions. If someone is, it certainly isn't your average Brit.

You're making light of the crimes committed against Europeans throughout history and exaggerating what the Europeans did to others. It suits your argument to do so. I don't fault you for that.

I guess white people don't belong to the working class, right? Your insults aside, there are many ways one could explain black unemployment numbers. One thing I do know is that it has nothing to do with some imaginary inter-generational post traumatic stress. That's one of the more outlandish explanations for black Americans' over-representation in violent crime and under-representation in higher education.

&gt;For example, it was the Belgium Army fighting in the Congo on the behalf of corporate interests. So, yes, the state does endorse this. 

That's all fine and good but I was talking about post-colonial governments.

&gt;The relationship between the colonized and the colonials is like a home owner and a thief. The thief has all of your shit but you still want him &gt;to get the fuck out of your house. At the end of it all you have nothing left. Is it your fault?

Infrastructure, education, modern medicine, and a written language in some cases. We gave these things to the colonized. I'd hardly consider the relationship to be one of a robber baron and a peasant.

&gt;The wealth they took went into the state and matters of the state, which the state benefited from and as such, successive generations of &gt;people living in that state benefit from that same exploitation.

Where does the state get its money? Who do you think is the one who really pays for restitution? That's my point. Generations today shouldn't be made to suffer for sins of the past. 

&gt;Are you some sort of Libertarian that believes everyone can quit a job and move on with their lives? 

People do it all the time. They weigh the risks and take their chances where they might have more opportunity. Many third world immigrants come to Europe with nothing. Many come illegally. If they can just quit their countries and move to Europe, they can certainly quit a job and move on with their lives.

I doubt many of these people care about colonialism. They've learned from your own media to beat you over the head with it in order to guilt you into giving them what they want. If you are so intent on eternally prostrating yourself to foreigners, why don't you do the 'tolerant' thing and give your house up to a family of Somalis? Maybe you could let Chinese nationals vote in your elections? The possibilities for saying, ""We're sorry"" are endless.

Madrid is hot in the summer, can get to 40¬∫C, It's a dry city heat, the problem is that the city saves heat during the day and then gives it back during the night. It's not unusual to have 30¬∫C at 1:00 am.  A shadow and a cold ca√±a will do wonders. If you come from a humid place you'll probably feel it most in your nose and skin, at least that what most people claim. You should avoid the central hours of the day, you can still do things, but you'll get sweaty. It's not like cordoba or sevilla where from 12 to 6 you just can't go out without a radiation suit but it's hot and people avoid the outside. To sleep simple fan should be enough, but AC wouldn't be a bad idea.  

Usually during the summer we tend to shift a bit our schedules. We'll eat later (3:00-5:00pm) and start having dinner anytime from 9 to 1am. We also tend to eat more vegetables, gazpacho, more refreshing light foods. (eating [cocido](https://www.google.es/search?q=cocido&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=8Ev&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;channel=rcs&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3WFcU-WXBee40QWGkYD4BQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1133&amp;bih=533#channel=rcs&amp;q=cocido%20madrile%C3%B1o&amp;revid=1305541895&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch) in the summer is having a deathwish)

Also, Madrid is 650 meters above sea level, if you do any athletics you might notice this. 

It's true the a lot people go out of the city in August, but this is a big city, there is always enough people. weekends will be no problem, and during the week you can still find places. It's a bit of an art to know which places will have that appropriate amount of people, but you'll find them.

The easy alternative is to go to huertas, huge number of bars and foreigners, plenty of people come to Madrid to learn Spanish, uni courses... Some of the university dorm rent rooms for groups and exchange student organizations... apparently they are a lot of fun. 

I personally love Madrid in the summer, days are so long(13h) and Madrid has a special light. Going to the park or to a simple square with a liter of beer and some friends is wonderful. Going out for drinks and not getting into a single bar because it's so nice outside (and an army of Chinese and Pakistan people supply you with beer at 1 euro a can or 5 a six pack). Manageable groups of people at events and museums. The traffic is much better and using a bicycle is a great idea.

- at the coca-cola store, I spoke a wrong plural (and the bill lacked 2 euros, which I promptly paid with an extra coin). The girl said that I should learn proper german before entering the country and the country should allow only germans. I laughed a lot. Only in Spain's airports I've been flagged so badly (because they do it to south americans all the time -- and I suspect everyone.)

- I was buying beer at a kiosk nearby the Isar. Asked for it, thanked for it, made a quick joke about being a lovely beer and the old lady asked if I were hungarian, because of the accent. Now that wasn't racism, but I might get sensitive about that because it's really nobody's business about my background.

Mind you I'm definitely white (as in: blue veins, greeny eyes and red beard, but black hair), and have dutch/german/north-italian ancestry (more germans than anything else). However I was born in south america and I have average height (as opposed to the giants in Munich). There's a chance I'm more german than the coca-cola girl.

I have a friend whose background is bavarian and portuguese/italian.

Some points from the video:

 ""They were talking about the Ukraine minister who ordered second phase of the anti-terrorism operation, which was putting the city under blockade. They were making sarcastic comments look at this blockade, [saying] we had no problems getting these three prisoners in, from their point of capture in another area, keep up the good blockade.""

two out of three of the officers were security in Ukrainian embassy in Iraq, one in 2004, another one in 2009-2010

One of the detained officers said Alpha does not have blood on their hands and that they are not going to fight their own people

The bearded officer repetitively calls for a diplomatic solution, and says that people on both sides of the conflict are prisoners of the situation. 

""As he says that, someone behind the camera says, ""What diplomacy my dear, we have 7 orphans here"" to which he immediately responds we don't have anything in common with Right Sector.""

Separatist commander says they will be either exchanged for separatist prisoners or kept as POWs until the conflict is resolved

They arrived on airplane then helicopter to Kramatorsk

Weaponry wise, they had ""two long"" and ""four short,"" meaning two assault rifles and four pistols (?)

Given the situation, they say their mission was unrealistic/doomed since the beginning

They were supposed to meet a higher up for further details on the mission

Once they arrived, within an hour, they were arrested

The bald guy says they needed to stalk the guy who occupied police building and kidnap him when possible (indeed an impossible mission)

The interview asks if the families of the officers were threatened. The main officer says directly no, but indirectly, it's possible (he's being unclear).

Says person who gave them orders had a green uniform w/o insignia. No names given.

Main guy served in Ukrainian forces since '96

Bearded guy again emphasizes that Alpha is the only morally good division of forces remaining (sounds apologetic)

The guy in a hoodie said they were indeed armed.

The guy in the hoodie says no mission was given, interviewer then says but you just said you came for the specific person. Then the main guy says they just arrived today so no clear steps were given yet regarding the mission.

Bearded separatist says the guy they were hunting arrested the officers and brought them there. Tells Alpha has low qualifications and no manliness

Bearded officer again defends Alpha and calls fro diplomatic solution. Says everybody is the prisoner of situation and the time is of essence

Ukrainian authorities keep it quiet and don't comment on the situation according to separatist.",0,1398567526,null,0,1398567870,0,ch312u5,t3_242fpt,t1_ch312u5,t3_242fpt,null,1433538072,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

The consensus also discourages any sort of government subsidy or tariff, even though the US has plenty of them itself, so that the US can export to that country more easily. US hegemonic status is also what has led to the dollar being used as the world's main reserve currency, which gives them huge economic leverage. And of course, if the US were to stop pursuing and maintaining its overseas empire, these economic advantages would fail and another country would step in to reap the benefits of being hegemon.

&gt;Mr Berlusconi has been friends with former KGB agent Mr Putin, for more than five years and the two have held numerous bilateral meetings as well as entertained each other on holiday.
