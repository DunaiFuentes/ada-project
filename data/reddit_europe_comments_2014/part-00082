No one says Norwegian doctors should be mandated to circumcise kids, no one. 

What they say is if a doctor is willing to practice circumcision, then they should be allowed to do so. Of course, not in a cave with a kitchen knife but at a hospital with all the necessary medical tools and hygienic standards.

&gt; Let them do it somewhere else then, let them take that chance on their own child.

Let me be honest with you. First of all, I believe that the Jews will not let this happen, but even if you guys ban the circumcision I'm perfectly fine with it. There will be a lot of Jews and Muslims who will see this as a business opportunity and will arrange ""circumcision trips"" to countries like Israel and Turkey. Jews and Muslims will have their boys circumcised anyways. There will be just other Jews and Muslims making money on this and I don't really see a problem with it.

For Finland, a big source of heating in the country overall is actually from gas (though not the biggest).

For Sweden, gas is used but things like coal/peat, biofuels and waste burning is a bigger source.

For Denmark, gas is a big source of heating. Bigger than coal, but smaller than biofuels.

The thing is that this doesn't separate between use in private homes and in things like big commercial buildings and factories.

Some other (though a few year older) numbers I looked at had gas as a completely insignificant source of energy in private homes in the Nordic countries. Only Denmark stood out, though gas was still not the biggest, and they had the most varied sources of all the Nordics. Electricity rules supreme in Norwegian homes, Finland have a mix between biofuels, electricity and district heating and Sweden with a mix of electricity and district heating.  

I suspect, in the case of Sweden and Finland, some of the gas is used for district heating. Could be swapped out with some other sources anyway, like pellets... or just burn more waste!

Basically, I wouldn't worry too much about gas dependency for the Nordics. All of it can be replaced.

I mean the shit they try to impose on the Nordics on environmental stuff is just insane when we're already 2 light years ahead with building/energy efficiency.

Well when we've been freezing our asses off for the last 500 years we've understood the importance of building well so expecting us to cut from already low waste from buildings at the same amount as the rest of Europe is just stupid.

What the Nordics needs is to leave this EU circus and create a Nordic Union. We're already excelling in education, heath care, economy and so on. By uniting the Nordics we'd be the tenth largest economy in the world with about 25 million people. Our internal and external politics would be aligned to what Nordics value and not what France, Germany or the UK thinks. Beyond that we'd have the natural resources to be self sufficient on many levels. Oil and Gas form Norway, Minerals and Forrest from Sweden and Finland just to mention a few.

Why our Nordic politicians don't talk more about a Nordic Union than EU is beyond me. We already have similar social welfare systems, our politics is almost identical, we've had passport freedom and re-location freedom for I don't know how many years. The fact is that we're basically a union already making it a federation would just remove the last bits of BS.

true,remzem,null,null,"There is no specific function though and it is a piece of skin. There are some theories as to its function but not much to back them up. 

&gt;There is debate about the role of the foreskin, with 
possible functions including keeping the glans moist 
(92), protecting the developing penis in utero (73), 
or enhancing sexual pleasure due to the presence of nerve receptors (93). ^http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596169_eng.pdf ^page ^13

As to the sexual bit there isn't much data backing it up. 

&gt;Although it has been argued that sexual function 
may diminish following circumcision due to the 
removal of the nerve endings in the foreskin and 
subsequent thickening of the epithelium of the glans 
(93), there is little evidence for this and studies are 
inconsistent (4, 43, 146–148). ^http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596169_eng.pdf ^page ^16

Wiki says the protective and immunological bits aren't definitive either. 
&gt;Gairdner (1949) states that the foreskin protects the glans.[14] The fold of the prepuce maintains sub-preputial wetness, which mixes with exfoliated skin to form smegma. The American Academy of Pediatrics (1999) state that ""no controlled scientific data are available regarding differing immune function in a penis with or without a foreskin.""[44] Inferior hygiene has been associated with balanitis,[45] though excessive washing can cause non-specific dermatitis.[46]
 
As to it protecting the developing penis in utero I couldn't find anything on that topic but even if it turns out to be true it hardly matters once the baby is born.

So basically.. piece of skin. Low risk (1.5%) of complications which are usually minor including bleeding and infection. Almost non existent rate of serious complications. Slight reduction in prevelance of penile cancers, UTIs and STDs.

Don't think circumcised men have numb penises. That would be a pretty serious complication. Reduction in sensation is possible, but whether that actually translates into anything meaningful isn't apparent. As cut men seem to enjoy similar levels of satisfaction as non-cut.

As long as you can also demonstrate that the removal isn't harming them physically, it's not something necessary, there's some minor benefit (even if it's merely of religious or cultural significance) and it's not damaging them psychologically (like altering their appearance or something could) than I don't see why parents shouldn't be allowed to make that decision.

Il est assez dur d'expliquer ce qu'est la philosophie tant c'est une discipline très large qui touche à tous les domaines.

La philosophie est une discipline intellectuelle qui peut simplement se résumer au fait penser une idée pour un quelconque phénomène. Certains considèrent cette branche du savoir comme étant *l'art de penser les choses*. La philosophie (""philo"" -&gt; *amour* ; ""sophie"" -&gt; *sagesse* ; -&gt; *l'amour de la sagesse*) s'intéresse à plusieurs aspects de la pensée mais aussi aux aspects de nôtre vie tels que:

* La métaphysique - On peut partir de questions qui semblent simples mais qui pourtant chamboulent des vies telles que ""Qu'est-ce que l'Être?"", ""Quel est le sens de la vie?"", etc.
* L'éthique - La morale: qu'est-ce qui est bien et qu'est-ce qui est mal? Pourquoi une action est-elle bonne tandis qu'une autre devrait être punissable? Etc
* La logique - Les mathématiques, qu'est-ce qui est vrai et qu'est-ce qui est faux, etc.
* La philosophie du langage
* La philosophie politique
* Et bien d'autres. Je te laisse consulter Wikipédia pour le reste (http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophie).

Je crois que c''est le plus simple qu'on peut faire pour définir ce que c'est!

Que dire d'autre? La philosophie existe chez l'Homme depuis des siècles (elle remontre jusqu'à l'antiquité) et c'est un domaine très important puisque c'est grâce à cela que le monde dans lequel nous vivons existe tel qu'il est aujourd'hui.

Wikipédia définit très bien ce que c'est:
&gt;Le mot « philosophie » désigne une activité et une discipline existant depuis l'Antiquité en Occident et se présentant comme un questionnement, une interprétation et une réflexion sur le monde et l'existence humaine, ou encore comme un savoir systématique. Différents buts peuvent lui être attribués, de la recherche de la vérité, et de la méditation sur le bien et le beau, à celle du sens de la vie, et du bonheur, mais elle consiste plus largement dans l'exercice systématique de la pensée et de la réflexion. Ancrée dès ses origines dans le dialogue et le débat d'idées, la philosophie peut également se concevoir comme une activité d'analyse, de définition, de création ou de méditation sur des concepts.",0,1395534831,null,0,1395586620,0,cg9eze7,t3_20vg16,t1_cg9eze7,t1_cg79osf,null,1433025257,3,false,philosophie,t5_310ju,3

Why would the U.S. have an agenda to promote circumcision? That sounds pretty /r/conspiracy -ish. I mean the state doesn't even pay for peoples healthcare there so there's no monetary motivation to fudge results it's all private insurers. A lot of those studies are international too examining rates of complication across different countries. I really don't see a well payed scientist at the federally funded cdc risking their job and reputation after years of study to promote some sort of evil agenda... Besides if there were obvious faults in the data they'd be pointed out by the review process.

Circumcision is actually far more beneficial in Africa or in populations where HIV rates are really high. It has a pretty clear benefit when it comes to female to male transmission of the disease. It's not that important in developed places because the disease isn't that prevalent and most people are tested for it. In Africa though anything to curb the spread should be welcome.

So who here went ape-shit about circumcision? And please tell me how it's a coincidence that an openly anti-Muslim guy with a history of being called a racist on reddit manages to praise Hitler and call for all muslims to go home in the same thread? But still not a racist, no of course not. Just a massive bigot I guess.

true,[deleted],null,null,"To explain a bit further, this has never been about now, this has always been about the future. Everyone seems to agree that we are in a period of flux where the post-Cold War order is no longer tenable. The United States is no able to maintain a unipolar power, so the question is what happens next. This battle and the coming ones will define the order for the next period of relative stability. It is up to us to try to shape that as best as we can. I've always felt a disingenuous vibe from Snowden. I find multiple aspects of him to be suspect, from his love for attention to the fact that he admitted that he signed up for intelligence to help propagate the Bush freedom agenda. His online chat logs show a deeply Tea Party streak in his politics. Ultimately you have to question why he said in 2009 that leaking Bush era intelligence should get Bradley Manning shot in the balls, but Obama's arguably less intrusive use of those tools was unacceptable. The only thing that fits with what we know is the hyper radicalized racial backlash in the Tea Party movement. In fact his writings during Obama's Presidency have become more and more fringe right-wing. Simply put, I believe that he betrayed the US for both right-wing partisan reasons and racial bias. After all why is it okay for the white President to do something but out of line for the black one? So ultimately, having a front row seat, I believe that the Tea Party rage has reached an irrational inflection point where they are so filled with hate that they are willing to injure the entire United States to hurt Obama. It is with that in mind, and observing the unnatural crush conservative Americans have on Putin, that I believe that Snowden is not a truth teller, but an agent for Putin, whom he identifies with as a conservative force reshaping the world.

The most recent one I ran into was that a friend of mine working in Malta had to get a certified letter from his ""home bank"" that he was basically not a terrorist or something, before they would let him open a bank account in Malta. Took weeks and a ton of bureaucracy to figure out what precisely he had to do, and then follow up to get them to process the result and open the account. Without that, he could not get paid, because he had to have a bank account in Malta before his Maltese employer would agree to pay him. So if the bank had arbitrarily denied him, he would be in a pretty tough position.

Alternately, we could be better about letting people use an account anywhere in Europe, e.g. you work in Denmark but you use a German bank account. However in Denmark at least that is not currently accepted (you need a Danish bank account to designate as your ""NemKonto"" for many purposes), and I think that's the case in many countries.

I'd budget around a year and a half to two years of studies. 

I'd inquire directly with http://www.uni-assist.de/index_en.html, you're probably going to apply through them and they can tell you better than anyone if you'll need to go to a studienkolleg. 

I've had to go to a studienkolleg after only having 11 classes and no A-levels, but I've seen it as a very positive experience. Keep in mind, I've applied when I was around your age too!

At uni, everyone uses slides you're told to bring with you or read through beforehand, the professor beams them up and talks throughout the lecture. Depending on your language level (which should be good enough once you go to the studienkolleg), the first semester may be challenging, but you have your slides to fall back on. 

I would recommend that you spend the year in a studienkolleg before you begin studying. You wont learn the German terms for terms you'd be learning, if you take AHE in England, I've seen my German really improve during that preparatory year and I only had to deal with around 5-6 subjects.

As can be seen in Sweden's graph hydro is largely responsible for regulating in a daily cycle and we export a lot more than we import. Norway uses basically only hydro and Finland, Estonia and Denmark is very dependent on burning fossil fuel.

Snowden is not intentionally a pawn for Putin and from what we've seen from people who have interviewed him in Russia, he is carrying on his operations independently.

If you turn on Russia Today, you'll be flooded with details on how the West is decadent and wrong in everything, with special emphasis on the NSA/Prism scandal. I by no means condone the NSA's actions, but that is the result of him continuing his whistle blowing while in Russia. 

Secondly, I think what he initially revealed about Prism along with spying on world leaders were serious enough that his motivations leading up to that are of secondary importance. He seems pretty right wing, but for me that doesn't take away from what he initially revealed any more than if he were anywhere else on the political spectrum (such as in the centre or on the far left).

But seriously: it is BILD, what did people expect.

And even though the author seems to be German, he doesn't know German history (which says something, because we get Nazi Germany shoved down our throats about 6-12 times in different classes while we are at school: 2x in history class, in German class under the pretext of analysing poetry from that era, in religious class so that the 2 churches can exonerate themselves from blame (""Look, there were people against Hitler, so all those people who joined the Nazi church organisation don't count, honest!""), French class gives you Nazi Germany as well, but at least it's from a different perspective. Politics class gives you Nazi Germany again, probably 2x, depending on the curriculum. And I might have forgotten some subjects)

Sooo, it is quite intriguing how he says:
&gt;Tymoshenko equates Russia’s annexation of Crimea, which was based on a clear vote by Crimean residents, with Hitler’s war of destruction against the Soviet Union, in which 20 million Soviet citizens were killed, including millions of Jews, communists and partisans who were mercilessly butchered, many in Ukraine.

Because he forgets that Hitler also started with not one but 2 ""clear votes"", one from the ""Saargebiet"" residents, one from the ""Ostmark"" (or as it is known today: Austria ;) ). Especially the Anschluss of Austria shows quite the similarity to Crimea: occupy the area under some pretext and afterwards organise a referendum to legalize the occupation.

I don't feel Putin is the new Hitler, that still would be way to far off. He might become the new Hitler if he continues like Hitler, but for now he isn't. But to deny that there is some similarity between what Russia does now and what Nazi Germany did between 1933 and 1939, that's just ignoring history.",0,1395565184,null,0,false,0,cg9nt5a,t3_214n8b,t1_cg9nt5a,t3_214n8b,null,1433029577,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Dans le temps j'avais participé et on avait réussi à réunir une longue liste de suggestions dans le sub consacré à l'apprentissage du français mais j'ai la flemme de chercher le(s) lien(s). Je me rappelle avoir inclus des titres bilingues, càd, l'histoire progresse simultanément en français et un anglais, sur chaque nouvelle double page on trouve le français sur la page de gauche et l'anglais sur celle de droite.

Peut-être que vous n'essayez pas le bon genre de roman, il faudrait que l'histoire soit captivante pour que l'on puisse suivre ses développements sans être obligé de s'attarder sur chaque mot inconnu. Il me semble qu'une intrigue policière soit la plus adaptée, Harlan Coben par exemple est bien traduit en français. Le style d'A.Christie ou A.C.Doyle ne se prête pas bien à l'exercice, à la différence de P.Highsmith ou J.H.Chase.

Parmi les auteurs écrivant directement en français je citerais Léo Malet, Franck Thilliez, Fred Vargas. Bernard Werber dans un autre genre, je crois que la trilogie ""Les fourmis"" vous sera accessible.

Avez-vous essayé les BDs ? Les classiques Asterix et Tintin, mais aussi des plus récents comme Agrippine, Les Bidochons, XIII, etc. Les BDs érotiques ne sont pas à négliger, première recommandation : Milo Manara. 

Puis, vous êtes sur reddit, il n'y a rien de mieux qu'une approche active pour s'améliorer, lire c'est bien mais cela reste tout de même passif. Il y a beaucoup de subs dans lesquels vous pourriez participer en français, voyez la liste sur r/france.

Le cose sono 2: o veramente la mia Puglia è davvero l'eccezione del sud, come molti ritengono, o credo tu abbia un concetto sbagliato di ""mentalità meridionale.""

Qui, nelle mie Murge, vi è il concetto imprescindibile di lavoro come fatica, insito e confermato da generazioni e generazioni di contadini che magari trovavano il posto in ferrovia, al comune, in posta, però poi, finito il turno, prendevano la bici e andavano a zappare il proprio campo.
Ho conosciuto gente che ti ride in faccia se il tuo lavoro ti consente di stare seduto mezza giornata e tu non sfrutti l'altra mezza per SUDARE e FATICARE. Il tutto non per avidità, ma solo per il valore nobilitante della fatica nei campi.

So che è un concetto strano da comprendere, ma ti assicuro che fino a una generazione fa era cosi: solo ora le cose stanno cambiando, e solo ora si nota un lassismo da parte delle nuove generazioni.

Whomever you'd like to sleep with or not is irrelevant to the point we argue.


You DID lose sensitivity in that region. Whether it affects you personally or not is not a valid point. 

Same logic would apply if a catholic priest would say ""Well, they cut off my balls and the whole of my penis, but I don't care if they do it to everyone because I'm a priest!""

That is definitely not sound logic, isn't it?


Undeniable facts are:

- you lost great amount of sensitivity in that region

- you lost protective layer of skin for your penile area

- you were exposed to dangers associated with circumcision (some children even die because of it, not many, but there are cases of that happenning)

You had been exposed to all that because of an ethically shady religious/traditional practice, social pressure (if you're an American) and debatable medical advantages (easily curable by regular washing as witnessed by most Europeans)

Now you tell me, are you defending circumcision because you don't want to admit you're a victim of your own parents' oldschool logic, or are you defending it because you have valid reasons to do so.

If you buy heroin from some shady guy then you could injure others. If you buy medication without a prescription then you could by lying and could kill yourself.

In my eyes the government's duty is to ""Protect Life, Liberty and The Pursuit of Happiness"". So far, for all of their flaws, the government has done a pretty good job or at least my government has. We life for 70+ years, have universal healthcare and can protest with little interference by the government. Even Neo Nazis can protest. To me that is freedom, to me the government, for its flaws, is doing a better job than you or your fascist and extremist ideological neighbours give it credit for or could do yourselves.

The free market has no such mechanisms to do this. It *cannot* protect you from a company like BP spilling oil though it can punish only afterwards. It cannot protect life efficiently. In the US where healthcare is mostly private costs are very, very high. Much higher than socialized or universal health care costs.

In South Africa when Apartheid was in place the majority had no say in what went on. It was awful. when Chile had no democracy but had a free market (Milton Friedman and friends helped Pinochet achieve this.) the economy tanked and the evil dictator Pinochet murdered and tortured people.

It is because of this brave men (and women) like the ones who led the French revolution and the American Revolution came to destroy these ideals and bring liberty to the lands.

The king doesn't.

You may be responsible for your life but you are also responsible for the death of others caused by your greed or addiction. You may earn more money with taxes but a man will now die on the street, homeless because he can't pay any bills. My family depends on government assistance. My step-father cannot get a job because he has to look after my mother. My mother has a high white blood cell count and high cholesterol. Without government assistance I don't even think they could live well. The bedroom tax, £10 because they had one spare room, was enough to make my mother cry. And that was only £10 per week.

* People learned some African geography this and last week, as former Socialist VP Simon, now in the middle of a scandal about unreported funds in an Austrian bank account, [was found to hold a Bissau-Guinean passport, likely semi-illegally](http://budapestbeacon.com/news-in-brief/gabor-simon-arrested-for-using-fake-passport-to-open-bank-account/). It was later reported that 9 different Bissau-Guinean passports were used to open bank accounts in a newly created bank back in November, but neither holds any funds or had any activity ever. A well-known fraudster/""entrepreneur""/business partner was connected to the case, as he was likely the dealer of the passports to politicians and businessmen by using his government contacts from the African country. [When the guy was taken in for questioning after a few days of debate, he died on the way in the police car, after what was reported as a heart attack from natural causes, but obviously everyone is tinfoil-hatting the crap out of the story.](http://www.politics.hu/20140320/business-associate-of-disgraced-former-socialist-simon-dies-after-arrest/)  edit: full scope of the story [here](https://hungarianspectrum.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/the-strange-story-of-gabor-simon-and-tamas-welsz/comment-page-1/), if you care for the read.

Béla Biszku, 94, has led a very quiet life until recently, when his case was brought to Parliamentary discussion by Fidesz and Jobbik speakers. Since all eyewitnesses are dead and physical evidence is non-existent, the suit will aim to determine Biszku's role in the violence by circumstantial details, whether he was really just a subordinate as he says, or did he willingly take part in basically lawless murders. He is without doubt guilty somehow, the question is how exactly. [Also he looks like Terry Richardson's very dapper hipster dad.](http://kep.index.hu/1/0/571/5712/57126/5712608_8d04dffb67234c612589f80559736cc7_wm.jpg)

* Vona Gábor, leader of Jobbik casually announced that he is going to have a TV debate with Orbán just before the elections (likely as a nod to online demand on forums and such), and the party itself released a statement about it a day later. The only issue with it was that they didn't ask Fidesz about it who quickly shot down the idea. Bummer, Gabi.

* A group of youth journalists released a hilarious video on why the voting age limit should be 25 instead of 18. They acted truly white-trash, pro-liberal, in-your-cheek throughout, with the perfect mix of arrogance and acted stupidity that I last saw in the UK version of The Office. Pretty much /r/circlejerk acted out in the Hungarian society. While the video is great in itself ([watch it with captions here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS6D25A2vhs)), the most hilarious was the commenters' response, those who thought they were being serious and called them traitor liberal jews who should be shot. About 2/3 of the comments were along those lines with only a few congratulating them. It was truly hilarious. [Comments in Hungarian hand-picked here](http://hello90.444.hu/2014/03/20/te-se-szavazz-25-alatt-ahogy-a-kommentelok-lattak/) for Hungarian speakers.

- There is a hefty debate at the moment on the *Børnecheck*, which is a core welfare payment that all parents, regardless of income, get to help pay for expenses associated with having children.

 The opposition and some media outlets are not happy about the fact, that Denmark cannot legislate so that EU-citizens have to live and pay taxes for a certain amount of time in order to be eligible for this benefit, since this would be against current EU-law. 

 The rhetoric is especially aimed at Eastern European EU-citizens and they have been described as ""~~grasshoppers~~"" ""locusts""  by one conservative MP.

 Furthermore some people say that the benefit is to cover expenses in Denmark at Danish price levels, which are a lot higher than in some other countries, therefore it is not fair that, for example, Polish workers can claim this benefit and send it back home. 

 The other side of the debate argue that eastern European workers are a surplus to the Danish state - they pay more in taxes than they get in return and they do jobs which are in demand and which Danes do not want to do.

 Furthermore, it became evident that more Danes in Sweden claim child benefits than Poles do in Denmark.

Here are a few other reasons why the new Russia is not the same as the old Soviet Union:

* Russian and Soviet are not interchangeable, Russians made up around 50% of the Soviet Union. 

* The Soviet Union was a one-party state. You can argue to hell about Russia being democratic or not, but you can't deny that opposition parties are allowed to exist. 

* &gt; Russia’s current economic system is highly imperfect, and suffers from weak legal institutions, corruption, an underdeveloped financial sector, and a host of other flaws. But what Russia does not suffer from is what the Soviet Union suffered from: massive economic distortion through state subsidies and outright fiat. 
&gt; The Soviet Union’s policy to contain inflation was not to raise interest rates or limit bank lending but to make inflation illegal. Inflation was banned and prices on a host of important goods were frozen (consumers, of course, paid the increased cost through ever-more-pervasive shortages). The Soviet treatment of unemployment was similar. The Soviet Union sought to lower unemployment not through tax credits or through loose monetary policy but by making unemployment a crime and forcing enterprises to boost their payrolls.

* The iron curtain was very real, Russians now have freedom of movement. 

* The Soviet Union was a wartime state, and spent something like a third of its GDP on military, cf. Russian military spending today which is around 4%.

--
Hours after Turkey’s increasingly jumpy government moved to block access to Twitter, Turkish citizens struck back – on the social media network itself.

Some circulated a photoshopped picture of Recep Tayyip Erdogan., prime minister, sinking his teeth into the cartoonish blue bird that serves as the network’s mascot. They were far from alone: the number of tweets sent after the midnight ban increased by about 140 per cent over normal levels, according to data provided by analytics company Brandwatch.

Twitter itself sent out mobile numbers that allowed Turkish consumers to keep using its service. In a tweet from its policy team, the company said: “We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform. We hope to have full access returned soon.”
In another technical fix against the ban, Turkish downloads of Hotspot Shield, the world’s most popular virtual private network service, increased to 270,000 on Friday – from a daily average of 7,000.

The Turkish users’ defiance and the sheer scale of their activity suggest no immediate end to the battering Mr Erdogan has suffered in cyberspace.
Seeking to silence allegations of corruption against him and his government in the run-up to local elections on March 30, he has removed some 7,000 policemen from their posts and boosted Ankara’s powers over judges and prosecutors.

But the internet has proved much harder to handle. A formal corruption investigation has stalled, Twitter and YouTube have been used to circulate apparently incriminating voice recordings of Mr Erdogan and his circle – including some he says are fake, but others he has acknowledged as authentic.

Yet more explosive leaks are expected ahead of this month’s elections – according to one rumour, more revelations will come on March 25. But if Turkey’s Twitter ban was intended to thwart the dissemination of such allegations, it has backfired spectacularly.

“Erdogan is constantly on the run now, I don’t think he has time to think,” said Soli Ozel at Kadir Has university in Istanbul. “He is trying to keep the scandal as muted as possible at all costs, but he can’t control the technology. Instead he is fuelling the fire of suspicion and making everyone anticipate what, if anything will come out on the 25th.”

Mr Erdogan took aim at Twitter on Thursday, saying he would “root out” the microblogging service for national security reasons. But he failed to account for his country’s predilection for social networks – a response, many say, to a cowed local media – which means that Twitter has greater penetration among Turkish internet users than in any other country in the world.
In a sign of the political difficulty faced by the ban, even President Abdullah Gul, who recently signed a bill increasing government control over the internet, took to Twitter to announce his own opposition to the measure. (One fellow Turkish user immediately asked him what settings he was using to access the network.)

Before long the European Commission, the Council of Europe, the UK government, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and many other non-governmental and international organisations had all sent their own tweets deploring what they depicted as an attack on free speech.

In the US, the White House said it was “deeply concerned that the Turkish government has blocked its citizens’ access to basic communication tools”. In a statement it said: “We oppose this restriction on the Turkish people’s access to information, which undermines their ability to exercise freedoms of expression and association and runs contrary to the principles of open governance that are critical to democratic governance and the universal rights that the US stands for around the world.”
Celebrities such as Russell Crowe, Richard Branson, Mia Farrow and Elijah Wood piled in.

The Turkish bar association filed a criminal complaint against the ban, which it said was illegal and disproportionate. As sporadic Twitter service returned in parts of the country, a degree of mystery surrounded who had formally imposed the measure, supposedly in response to court complaints about invasion of privacy.

The government says the ban was imposed because Twitter had failed to respect such court complaints; a lawyer for Twitter was in Ankara for meetings on Friday afternoon.
“These steps are very crucial for the Turkish legal system,” said Selin Erciyas, at Mehmet Gun &amp; Partners, an Istanbul law firm. “We will see if there is a true objective legal system or whether it is just Erdogan that decides things in court.”

This has caused problems to the officials of the KHL as they feel it's unsafe to have games in Doneck right now thus the team has to play it's home games in Bratislava. The Donbass team is upset about it and calls the decision politically motivated.  
  
* One of the owners of Dinamo (former president Ulmanis) has said that the **team should leave the KHL** if Russia further escalates the situation in Ukraine. The other owner (gas importer Savickis) immediately responded that Dinamo should do no such thing, especially since if war breaks out KHL would stop  functioning anyway.

It was later reported that 9 different **Bissau-Guinean** passports were used to open bank accounts in a newly created bank back in November, but neither holds any funds or had any activity ever. A well-known fraudster/""entrepreneur""/business partner was connected to the case, as he was likely the dealer of the passports to politicians and businessmen by using his government contacts from the African country. When the guy was taken in for questioning after a few days of debate, he died on the way in the police car, after what was reported as a heart attack from natural causes, but obviously everyone is tinfoil-hatting the crap out of the story.

Not sure if it's some kind of miss translation, but it should be Guinea-Bissau passport, and not the other way around.

No.

If I agree with you on that the sky is blue, it doesn't mean that I agree with everything else. Your just pathetic, juvenile and have managed to once again confirm my view on fanatic muslims like you. Oh and on reddit there are tons of people like you who call everyone racist as soon as they don't agree with you. Sure call me racist if that makes you feel better.

Hanno detto che avevano un programma e fanno di tutto (cazzate incluse) per portarlo avanti.

I think the ""reasoning"" behind getting more money just because you are older is that they reward ""loyalty"". And that if you got political connections to get you hired, you don't want some other ""criterion of your performance"" other than how long you've been around. 

Btw they have a program for the unemployed where you get ""500 euros a month for 5 months"" working at some agency, and many of those people come out upset cause ""some other guy without a college degree does the same or often less work than I do and he gets paid 1200+ taking 10 days of 'health related' absence leaves a month"" (this is kind of rare but it does happen if you have the connections)

Also Greece is patriarchical or something, the way many young and unemployed (or part time employed etc.) survive, is cause the oldest person in the family gets enogh to support them to some extent. That's what the social contract is or something.

I am not sure if you officialy can get 1.5k at this point, but if you know the right people, you can abuse ""performance bonuses"" and make back all the cuts in the actual salary.

But I am fucking disgusted by this bonus to the ""uniformed"", cause it's some kind of subtle fascism.

Not to mention the context of Kosovo/Crimea isn't even close. NATO forces were in Kosovo on a ""humanitarian war"" mission, which was vindicated in 2001 when the UN found there was a ""a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments"" by the Yugoslav forces. NATO troops were clearly identified troops, with uniforms and badges.

Kosovo was a UN mandate for a transitional period, with a UN task force(KFOR) there to maintain peace.

Not to mention the Kosovo War started as an armed struggle by Kosovars, *for* Kosovars. NATO didn't ignite it, NATO didn't fabricate it.

On top of this, both Kosovars and Yuogslavs were committing war crimes on one another. 

And on top of this, this was over the period of years, with a backdrop of violence, where one country was fighting for *independence*, not annexation by a foreign military force.

Now, compare this to Crimea. No violence, especially of the ethnic nature. No violent rebellion by Crimeans for independence. Then out of nowhere, unmarked Russian troops invade and take over the infrastructure. Then the Crimean government gets ousted and in place a pro-Russian government(Which held **4%** of the popular vote) was put in its place. Then that 4% government announces a referendum. All Ukrainian forces, who were entirely a neutral force in the political unrest - ***entirely different*** to Yugoslavia - are trapped in their bases by the Russian troops. Then the referendum is held, where both options are essentially to join the Russian Federation. All in a period of 2 weeks. Not months, not years, *weeks*. All of this, with no prior popular call for independence from the Crimeans. 

Kosovo became independent in 2008 after *nearly a decade of oversight* with widespread international input on their constitution and negotiations between Kosovars and Yugoslavs(And later Serbians). Yeah, it was a unilateral declaration, but it has always been the will of the majority. It can't be compared.

Das heißt durch Gentechnik werden nicht die Maiskörner größer o.ä., sondern es werden mehr Schädlinge und Unkraut abgewehrt und dadurch ist der Ertrag letztendlich größer.

Wenn man nun nichts gegen die Evolution von Resistenzen tut (z.B. indem man einen kleinen Teil des Feldes opfert), dann wird der gesamte Nutzen der Gentechnik hinfällig. Wenn es keine resistenten Schädlinge gäbe, wäre ein Gentechnik-Feld mit refuges immernoch viel ertragreicher als ein normales Feld.

Das Problem ist jedoch, dass auch trotz refuges noch resistente Schädlinge und Unkräuter evolvieren. Das ist meiner Ansicht nach darauf zurückzuführen, dass sich die Farmer in den USA zu sehr auf die Gentechnik verlassen. Das ist natürlich wiederum auf große Biotech-Firmen wie Monsanto zurückzuführen, weil sie natürlich ihr Produkt verkaufen wollen und als perfekt darstellen. Die Reaktion von Monsanto auf die Entstehung von resistenten Schädlingen ist fast schon zynisch. ""Ach, wir bauen einfach noch mehr Toxine ein dann wird das schon."" Gentechnik ist kein Allheilmittel das ein Feld immun gegen jegliche Schädlinge macht. Man muss Gentechnik kombiniert mit klassischen Methoden der Landwirtschaft einsetzen.

I separate the corruption, because some people said that they are tired of corruption news, they can skip that.

I find interesting how biased an pro-Spanish government are getting all the big media groups.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; And significant parts of the district heating is by natural gas in Finland...

The most used fuel in producing district heat is wood. Gas is used in some power plants to produce electricity and also district heat. Only 10% of *all* primary energy usage in Finland is from natural gas. If for some reason natural gas stopped flowing tomorrow no-one would freeze to death because those power plants can switch over to other fuels although there would be costs in doing that.

&gt; District heating using nuclear is almost unheard of and mostly unfeasible. District heating using hydropower doesn't really exist.

Right, using hydro for district heating would not make much sense. And while NPPs could be candidates for producing district heat as a side product they are often located too far from population centers for it to be economically feasible, and depending on the reactor type the cooling water often has quite low temperature.

But both nuclear and hydro produce electricity which is used for electric heating and about a quarter of housing in Finland uses electric heating. Therefore in Finland heating does use also hydro, nuclear and other means of electricity production.",0,1395581023,null,0,1395581740,0,cg9q6dr,t3_212emb,t1_cg9q6dr,t1_cg9nw18,null,1433030693,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,rensch,NETH,The Netherlands,"Netherlands: 

Municipal elections:
The two governing parties, the liberal VVD and its junior coalition partner Labour (PvdA), endure heavy losses. Especially Labour, traditionally dominant in the larger cities, loses important bastions like Tilburg, Rotterdam, The Hague and even the capital city of Amsterdam. In the latter, Labour had always been the largest party in the city council in over five decades. Other losses were for the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the environmentalist Green Left party.

Many cities are now won by the centrist liberal democrats of D66, which has been on a slow but steady rise to victory for several years under its leader Alexander Pechtold. Utrecht, Tilburg, The Hague and Amsterdam, among others, are now dominated by D66, which took much of the Labour vote.

Another threat to Labour is located on the left in the form of this week's other major winner: the Socialist Party. The leftist SP, led by the jovial Emile Roemer, takes over from Labour as main left-of-center party in many cities and towns throughout the country. The socialists have had their best result in any local election since the party was founded as a radical splinter group in the 70s.

The biggest victory was for locally active parties, which are only actice in one municipality or region. They attract many kinds of voters due to their focus on local issues. Some municipalities have multiple local parties to choose from so the combined number of votes of all of them is higher than that of any national party, making it the country's dominant political family in local government.

But the most talked-about party was one that only participated in two cities. Geert Wilders' far-right Freedom Party (PVV) rose to renewed controversy after Wilders openly expressed hopes his party could allow for ""less Moroccans if possible"" while campaigning in his hometown of The Hague. These remarks sparked a national controversy, especially after Wilders asked his own supporters wether they wanted ""more or less Moroccans"" at an election gathering of his party wednesday night. His supporters responded by chanting ""less, less, less"" to which Wilders replied with ""fine, I'll take care of that"". Many leading figures, including MP's and the leader of the PVV in the European parliament, have since resigned from the party. Polls this weekend show a drop in support for the PVV, which had been leading the polls for months.

A minor but interesting development was found in my hometown of Vlissingen. Here the first female councillor of the Political Reformed Party (SGP) was elected. The SGP is an orthodox calvinist party which until recently didn't allow women on its ballot based on Biblical principles. The European Court for Human Rights ordered the party to stop the discriminatory policy, however. This led Lilian Janse to become the first female leader of a local SGP branch and the party's first female elected official ever. The SGP isn't very strong in the city council, though. Unlike in surrounding towns, where it is well-represented, the SGP holds just one seat in Vlissingen, one of the more secular towns in the otherwise conservative Zeeland province. Janse's campaign drew sympathy votes from people who would otherwise have voted CDA or the Christian Union (CU).

After all, Russia already pulled a scenario very similar to that in Crimea 20 years earlier in Moldova by militarily backing pro-Russian separatists (in a war that cost hundreds of Moldovan lives) who successfully set up a *de facto* independent breakaway republic in the eastern part of Moldova. The only difference is that Russia never annexed Transnistria, but their rationale for not doing this is almost certainly more due to pragmatism than any kind of respect for international law. By using Transnistria as a thorn in Moldova's side, they can significantly restrict Moldova's freedom of motion on the international arena, and besides supplying a Transnitrian exclave through a now hostile Ukraine would be a logistical nightmare.

While I appreciate the new statements of support for Moldova's territorial integrity, I can't help but be utterly cynical about them. Moldova's territorial integrity is not in any more danger today than it was  over the past two decades, and 20 years ago when Moldova really needed help, no real  assistance came from Europe. Now when Ukraine needs Europe's support in the face of blatant Russian aggression, Europe again has refused to provide any meaningful assistance. It seems as though bringing up Moldova just allows EU officials to pat themselves on the back over a completely fictional threat while ignoring the real issue of the day.

Das ist das Standardargument. Es greift aber meistens nicht, weil die ""langsamen Folgen"" oft nicht aus einer erzählerischen Notwendigkeit resultieren, sondern z.B. daraus, daß in der Staffel ein Vertrag über meinetwegen 22 Folgen erfüllt werden muß, während die innere Stringenz der Geschichte eigentlich eigentlich auch gut mit 15 Folgen auskäme. 

Mit anderen Worten: Die Autoren müssen sich irgendwas aus den Fingern saugen. 

&gt;Sieht man ja auch daran, dass komplexe Geschichten besser erzählt werden können, als in filmen

Das ist mehr oder weniger mein prinzipieller Punkt: Serien haben nicht per se komplexere Geschichten, sie haben nur komplexere Handlungen.  

Bei Hemingway fährt einer mit dem Schiff aufs mehr, fängt einen Fisch, versucht ihn in Heim zu bekommen, schafft es nicht, Ende. 130 Seiten, äußerst simple Handlung - aber keine simple Geschichte.

Natürlich ist es ein berechtigter Einwand, wenn man sagt, daß es Quatsch ist, zwei verschiedene Erzählformen miteinander zu vergleichen und dabei dann ausgerechnet noch Hemingway nimmt. 

Darum geht es mir aber gar nicht. Worauf ich hinaus will, ist daß es aus Perspektive eines Autors für die Geschichte nicht zwangsläufig von Vorteil ist, wenn er zuviel Platz hat um sich auszutoben. Eine blanke Abfolge von ""Dingen die passiert sind"" ist nicht notwendigerweise eine Geschichte.  


Gerade bei Serien, also einem Genre, bei dem die Autoren meistens gar keine richtige Vorstellung davon haben können, wo die Reise in fünf Jahren hingehen soll, kommt das meines Erachtens oft zum Tragen.

If you put your penis inside any animal not capable of giving consent, it is rape.  Charging other people money to fuck your dog is rape.

&gt;*Laws in both Denmark and Norway are fairly open when it comes to a person’s legal right to engage in sexual activity with an animal. The law states that doing so is perfectly legal, so long as the animal involved does not suffer.

&gt;*On the internet, several Danish animal owners openly advertise their services. The newspaper contacted several such individuals and was told that many of the animals have been engaged in this kind of activity for several years and that the animals crave the sexual stimulation. The newspaper found that the cost charged by the animal owners varied from DKK 500 to 1,000 (USD$85 to $170).*

I think that the fact that the child can't decide, is therefore a weak argument against, because since the child can't decide it falls on the parents to make that decision, not the government. 

Additionally there is almost no bleeding and little pain at that age, but later on when the nerves and the blood vessels become established, it's a much much more painful and complicated procedure.  

There are good faith arguments on both sides of this issue, but the child's ability to make informed consent isn't one of them.  If left up to an infant to decide what they should do, they would drink a mixture of ginger ale and cocaine until they died, provided that's an option, which is why these judgements should default to the parent.

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"They have to invent new ones if the puns don't work when translated literally, or they invent a totally new joke.

A notable example I can think of is in ""Dumb and Dumber"". After some crisis, in the original English version, Jim Carrey's character says they should go to a place where there's sun, and ""beer flows like wine"", they should go to Aspen. Jeff Daniels' character answers ""I don't know, the French are assholes"", presumably because he thought sunshine and wine was referencing France.

In the French version, they actually invent a pun. Carrey's character says ""Aspen"", which kind of sounds like ""Espagne"", which is the French word for ""Spain"". So Daniels' character answers in French ""I don't know, the Spanish are assholes"" (in French ""les espagnols sont si cons"").

Now, there might be something about the French dubbed version not wanting to have a joke insulting the French, but I don't think so. It just works better with the invented pun, and a French audience would surely prefer a joke against a neighbor. 

Anyway, my point is that when films are dubbed or subtitled, they often have to reinvent a joke.. though sometimes it's not possible and thus a funny moment in the original English version may be lost in the translation (but I can't think of an example right now, considering it's rare for me to have seen a movie in the original English version and in a dubbed version... and I tend to not use subtitles).

Also, I'd like to say that when it comes to dubbing, some countries do a better job than others. In France we like to criticize the dubbing industry... but ultimately, we have real professionals who do their best to make it look and sound good. Jim Carrey's French counterpart is actually pretty good for example. I've encountered films dubbed in other languages, notably in some Eastern European countries, where it seems they just have a narrator translating the conversations over the original English conversation. Absolutely horrible. 

edit : I've thought of another example from a Jim Carrey movie. In Ace Ventura 2, Jim Carrey says ""you must be the Monopoly Guy!"" to some dude with a mustache and monocle. In the French version he says ""you must be Colonel Mustard"", in reference to another boardgame : Clue (or Cluedo). I don't know why they changed the joke..

true,Snoron,EURO,"Sandy Lane, Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, UK, EU, Earth","The thing about article 18 is that a) it mostly refers to religious belief, but b) if a religious practise is against the law then it's tough shit.

There are many religions that condone murder for various reasons but that doesn't mean it is permitted in most countries even for those reasons.

There are already thousands of laws that override religion.

The argument is that mutilating a newborn baby should be against the law because it is a barbaric thing that has no place in our world.

Would you condone the right of anyone to mutilate any baby in any way the parent sees fit? [I will assume the answer is ""no"" but please correct me if otherwise]

So you agree that mutilating babies should be against the law? And that murder should be against the law?

But for some reason you want to make one specific exception about mutilating a baby in a specific way for a specific religion.

If you have the right to do that, then other religions should have the right to break any laws they see fit if the specific circumstance is condoned by their religion, surely?

All you basically have is appeal to tradition.

The only reason it's allowed is because it's always been allowed. Nothing this fucked up would ever be allowed today as a new thing. If no one was mutilating the genitals of babies it would never ever be allowed to start for whatever reason in today's world.

It's unimaginably fucked up in the same way it would be if I started chopping ears off newborn babies - and the only *actual* difference is ""well, we've always done this"". Would you consider severing of babies ears sinful and against the wishes of God? [I will assume ""yes"" here]

Well, we've always done lots of things - and at some point a lot of them have come to an end. This is just another one of those things.

But hey now let's tackle this from the other side - from within the confines of Judaism. Let us not forget the text from the wiki linked above:

&gt; While it is true that both religious and secular Jewish culture have tended to place an irrational emphasis on foreskin amputation, it is also true that Jewish foreskin amputation was completely changed around 140 AD from slicing only the very tip of the foreskin leaving the ridged band intact to the much more severe cut we know today that always amputates the entire ridged band. Jewish ritual circumcision has changed before and can change again.

Hmmm.. so wait - if you think cutting parts off children (such as ears) would be sinful, then circumcision in its current form would also be, simply because it is in its current form a random act of mutilation that was never specifically condoned by God.

Turns out that *most probably* all Jews who practise circumcision in its current form are in fact committing a grave sin even within the confines of their own religion.

And let us not forget the time-scale here - Jews were most likely doing it a different way for a longer period of time than they have been doing it the new way.

NATO troops were clearly identified troops, with uniforms and badges.

It is interesting how you quote NATO reports, as if they were objective and have the purpose of determining the truth. The truth is that NATO countries benefit from the Kosovo independence, since they found an ally in Kosovo and since a USA military base Bondsteel is located there. USA and its allies have no benefits from Crimea entering the Russian Federation, and that is the only reason it is against Russia's efforts to allow Crimea to join the Federation.

&gt; Not to mention the Kosovo War started as an armed struggle by Kosovars, for Kosovars.

It was a struggle by a paramilitary organisation KLA-[terrorists and drug smugglers](http://www.cfr.org/terrorism/terrorist-groups-political-legitimacy/p10159#p4), who also acquired funds by [removing and selling organs of their victims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_theft_in_Kosovo).

So you're saying that you have to have decades worth of fighting and conflicts before one can declare independence? Besides that's just not true, Russians in both Russia and Crimea have expressed such intentions before, but due to lack of opportunity, people haven't been trying to get the most out of the situation.

I like bringing examples from my own country, so I'll bring one again. In 1917, the majority of Estonians weren't publicly vying for independence. Everyone talked about autonomy within Russia, Estonian-led government etc. Then, when suddenly with the Russian revolutions and capitulation to Germany, a window opened which could've been used for declaring independence. You could say the founding fathers had more than 4% of support, but even still, prior to escalation of chaos of conflict, most of the people would not have voted for independence. It all changed when given the chance. 

I really don't see how the length of a conflict is a defining factor for its legitimacy.

There has been a larger growth due to Agenda 2010 coming into effect, and a swing-back growth after the Lehman issue but generally, growth has been remarkably stable.

No, I'm saying in the modern day where there is no violence in a region that secession is done democratically. Not when a foreign invasion decides it is time to do it.

&gt;Besides that's just not true, Russians in both Russia and Crimea have expressed such intentions before, but due to lack of opportunity, people haven't been trying to get the most out of the situation.

And a strong majority has been against it. Point?

&gt;I like bringing examples from my own country, so I'll bring one again. In 1917, the majority of Estonians weren't publicly vying for independence. Everyone talked about autonomy within Russia, Estonian-led government etc. Then, when suddenly with the Russian revolutions and capitulation to Germany, a window opened which could've been used for declaring independence. You could say the founding fathers had more than 4% of support, but even still, prior to escalation of chaos of conflict, most of the people would not have voted for independence. It all changed when given the chance.

I'm sorry but this isn't 1917 anymore and we're not in the middle of World War I. Yes, I get your point, but it's a very different time period. Things such as this are supposed to be handled with diplomacy, especially where there is no backdrop of violence.

&gt;I really don't see how the length of a conflict is a defining factor for its legitimacy.
Disclaimer: I don't support Crimean independence nor do I think it's legitimate. I just don't think the time factor is relevant.

The time factor isn't the deciding factor in a violent uprising. The time factor is a deciding factor in a democratic negotiations, as it readily displays that things have been thought through, both sides have had significant time to plan their Yes/No campaigns, the local governments can prepare for independence and the local population has time to prepare.

true,NYGreenandwhite,GREE,Greece,"Crimea was a militarily strategic site which Russia coveted and could not give up under any circumstances. They did anything and everything possible. Believing this was about *protecting Russians* is to fall for their propaganda hook, line and sinker. We can discard anything related to this out the window and focus on the real reasons Russia has for intervention. It seems Western media is doing not doing that, given all the scaremongering about Russia going after Moldova, eastern Ukraine, even *current NATO nations*. Putin is not a stupid person, the situation in Crimea is happening the way it is for a very specific reason, the whole ""protecting Russians"" thing being used as a rhetorical backup.

The same is true of Kosovo. It represents a very significant military site for the US in a very anti-US region. The US did anything and everything possible in that situation as well, including breaking all previous precedents for independence movements as well as supporting the drug/organ-trafficking mafia KLA. US intervention in Kosovo, just like Russian intervention in Crimea, was done primarily for militarily strategic purposes, and they stop at nothing to achieve their aims just like the Russians. The only difference is that the US in Kosovo had the political support of the European Union. The US' line of ""ethnic cleansing""* is the equivalent of Putins ""protecting Russians"" line. 

And for those who say ""well, there was a war there, even if it wasn't ethnic cleansing"": to support this rationale is to support US foreign policy which allows them to intervene in every conflict that occurs on this planet.

You don't have to be a genius to figure that one out.

Uh, that's not really how religious law works. Because all religious law in Abrahamic religions is working from revelation at a fixed point in the past, rules are changed based on new *interpretations* of the original revealed text. 

But what was more likely in this particular instance is that the original text was vague, and said ""you just have to circumcise your son"" without specifying *how*. Different communities had different methods of circumcision, based on differing interpretations of what ""circumcise"" means, and eventually one of those methods overruled the rest and was adopted by everyone. Any of the methods would have satisfied the commandment, but convention dictated *how*, and conventions change.

Oh please, this is the exact opposite of what happened. The EU was happy with Ukraine having good ties with both EU and Russia, in fact we're still saying that a future Ukraine should get along with both factions. 

When EU representatives went to Moscow to seek goodwill for the association agreement all they got was ""How will this affect the planned customs union? You're trying to sabotage us!!"". Followed by the Russians bribing and coercing Yanukovich to stay exclusively with them (which he tried to do).

Russia was paranoid about ""losing"" (as if they owned it in the first place) Ukraine to the Western sphere so they made it an either-or question. The deal the Russians offered was better monetarily but the protesters didn't want it because for them it was about the future - would they rather end up like the EU, or like Russia.

How much of those bases, for instance, was paid for by people in the rest of Ukraine?

How much of Ukraine's debt should be assumed by Crimea?

Matters such as Federal property versus Provincial property come to mind as well.

Thus, in addition to the very blatant military annexation of Crimea is also the flagrant and complete disregard for how a legal separation would occur even if the referendum was a not a fraud manipulated by Russian military street thugs.

In any proper court of law, Russia's actions would be heavily sanctioned -- regardless of whatever rights or valid arguments they may have in the disagreement -- because they jumped the gun and took everything for themselves. 

It just isn't all theirs to take in any review of the situation. Thus, there is just no way Crimea can legally be recognized by anyone as belonging to Russia. Any country that did so would set a precedent under which some part of their territory could be unilaterally claimed without compensation or negotiation.

In effect, by annexing Crimea the way that they did, the entire state of Russia is of dubious legality at this time.

&gt; Wood became the most important energy source for district heating in 2013. Finnish Energy Industries’ (ET) figures show that the share of wood, wood residue and other indigenous renewable energy sources increased to 29 per cent. When the use of secondary heat from industry is also included in the calculations, the share of carbon-neutral production in district heat generation increased to 31 per cent.
&gt;
– This is an increase of six percentage points, which is a significant step in district heat operations, says Director Jari Kostama of ET. The increased use of biofuels also resulted in reduced carbon dioxide emissions from district heat generation, although the volume of generation, which was smaller than in the previous year, also contributed to the reduction.",0,1395593997,null,0,false,0,cg9ueci,t3_212emb,t1_cg9ueci,t1_cg9qh9y,null,1433032749,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"Tiens, mon témoignage. Entrepreneur Français, content de payer mes impôts, auto-entrepreneur je demandais à payer plus d'impôts en échange d'un relèvement du plafond.

J'ai été contraint à l'exil, pas fiscal, mais sentimental: je vis un an (puis deux) avec ma femme étrangère au Japon. Ce n'est pas trop un problème pour mon boulot: je travaille par internet, je suis le seul employé de ma SAS. Je recruterai surement en rentrant.

Ce qui m'a fait partir en chantant, c'est la honte et l'humiliation qu'on a fait subir à ma femme pour qu'elle puisse obtenir une carte de séjour. Une attente devant la préfecture à 3h du matin. Pour une carte de 1 an (en fait 9 mois si on compte à partir du moment où on la reçoit effectivement). Au Japon, on me la faite en 5 minutes **à l'aéroport**. 

Je dois avouer que c'est ce qui me fait le plus hésiter à revenir. Ma femme va accoucher au Japon. Ça coûte cher. J'y paye une sécu pour moi et je cotise en plus à la sécu en France (c'est obligé) via ma SAS. J'aime beaucoup de choses en France, mais bordel, le Japon qui a une image de pays xénophobe est carrément plus accueillant dans les faits avec les ressortissants étrangers que le ""pays des droits de l'homme""! 

Et par ailleurs, comme les interconnexions bancaires en sont encore à la préhistoire malgré des décennies de frais internationaux inexplicablement engloutis, j'ai du me déclarer freelance au Japon pour certains clients locaux (on m'a soutenu aux impôts en France et aux impôts au Japon que c'était logique pour moi). Et ce que je touche via eux, j'ai deux à trois fois moins d'impôts à payer dessus. 

Et là, je n'en reviens pas. Je me retrouve en situation d'optimisation fiscale parce que des gens n'ont pas bien fait leur boulot dans un des deux pays: je vais facturer mes clients Français en France, mes clients Japonais au Japon, mais mes clients US? Ben je vais les facturer dans le pays où je paye le moins d'impôts.

Je suis choqué. J'ai pas cherché à optimiser, je trouve le procédé vraiment contestable. Mais je n'ai tout simplement pas eu le choix: pour certains clients Japonais, c'est une tannée incommensurable d'obtenir l'autorisation d'effectuer un paiement à l'étranger et je me retrouve avec ces deux possibilités 100% légales.

Ah tiens, et un autre truc: ici, être freelance, c'est légal par défaut. Nous on considère le statut d'auto-entrepreneur comme une invention majeure, eux c'est juste une case dans leur déclaration d'impots perso. Tu bosses en freelance ? Ben si tu le déclares c'est bon.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; The minority language bill did pass in parliament, it was then vetoed. So while it did not actually come into effect, I can understand why the fact that it found majority support in the first place and that it was apparently the top priority after the coup might worry Russian speakers.

The issue was about *repealing an earlier unconstitutional law*: the lopsided Ukrainian Law on Language Policy of 2012 pushed forward by Yanukovich.

The law had been adopted illegally and uncostitutionally. That's why it was among the 300 or so acts and laws to be repealed for the same reason. But the PM said that despite the law being poor it is still better to keep it in effect until a better law is prepared, and it was not repealed.

And the Ukrainian Law on Language Policy of 2012 was not a good law to begin with. Both the law and its illegal adoption were heavily criticized by relevant watchdogs, scholars, representatives of other minorities and ministeries as lopsided, substandard, and disproportionally favouring one language.

In 2012 the law was [criticized](http://www.uaba.org/resources/Documents/Blog%20Docs/12-08-23%20Amb%20Vollebaek%20Letter%20to%20Ukrainian-Am%20%20Bar%20Assoc_16%20Aug.pdf) by the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities as its *""approach to language policy is deeply divisive and is likely to lead to future polarization of society. Indeed, the disproportionate favoring of the Russian language, while also removing most incentives for learning or using Ukrainian in large parts of the country, could potentially undermine Ukraine’s very cohesion""*. He was also concerned that the legislation was not adopted in accordance with Ukrainian constitutional and procedural law.

The Council of Europe stated ([1](http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=CDL-REF%282011%29001-e), [2](http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=CDL%282011%29101-e)) that the legislation failed to provide a proper balance between the development and use of a state language as a unifying factor in society and the development and protection of minority languages in accordance with European standards.

The law was also criticized by Ukrainian legal scholars, the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and other academic institutions, and numerous ministeries within the Yanukovych government as divisive and failing to protect the rights of all Ukrainians irrespective of their ethnic background.

Framing the non-repealment of that law as some sort of persecution of Russian minority is streching it. Even more idiotic is to present it as comparable to what happened in Kosovo with murder, rape, terror and ethnic cleansing and stuff.",0,1395595571,null,0,false,0,cg9v0w6,t3_2154c7,t1_cg9v0w6,t1_cg9qvju,null,1433033043,15,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,15

Exactly. Many people in the US who are not jews still get circumcised, either because they've been fed the bullshit health benefits of the operation, or because ""it's always been done"" and they don't know any better.    

In fact I think these people are even more retarded, since they have no religious motivation to do it, unlike jews who apparently think god is pleased when they slice their penises. What a strange fetish. Actually, how stupid is that even from a religious viewpoint?    
""I am God. I made your body this way because it is my will and I had entire control of your creation. Now you will cut this one part that I put there myself, because uh..... something... (I can't say I enjoy the sound of babies suffering, can I? Yeah. Inappropriate.)""    

Point is, you really have to be a jew or misguided to think circumcision is a good thing. If you're an american jew, double whammy for your penis!

&gt;Which has been found entirely safe by all scientific studies

That's nice. You know what else has been found about circumcision? It is entirely fucking useless except for rare medical occurences, like phimosis. The research was conducted by every uncut man ever since the beginning of time. If you'll look at societies where circumcision is not widely practiced (which is most countries really), you will find that no, we are not riddled with foreskin cancer epidemics. If you want data to back up this claim, you've got some walking sources all over the planet who live perfectly healthy with the cap on their pen.   

So, if I'm right in guessing you are a jew, you people need to quit acting like victims. The bible says we should stone to death adulterers and blasphemers, yet we don't do that, because we aren't bronze age barbarians anymore. Is anyone crying ""boo hoo anti christian""?

&gt; The President of Ukraine may be removed from office by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine by the procedure of impeachment, in the event that he or she commits state treason or other crime.
The issue of the removal of the President of Ukraine from office by the procedure of impeachment is initiated by the majority of the constitutional composition of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.
To conduct the investigation, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine establishes a special temporary investigatory commission whose composition includes a special Prosecutor and special investigators.
The conclusions and proposals of the temporary investigatory commission are considered at a meeting of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.
&gt;For cause, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, by no less than two-thirds of its constitutional composition, adopts a decision on the accusation of the President of Ukraine.
&gt;The decision on the removal of the President of Ukraine from office by the procedure of impeachment is adopted by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine by no less than three-quarters of its constitutional composition, after the review of the case by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine and the receipt of its opinion on the observance of the constitutional procedure of investigation and consideration of the case of impeachment, and the receipt of the opinion of the Supreme Court of Ukraine to the effect that the acts, of which the President of Ukraine is accused, contain elements of state treason or other crime.

None of that happened. The whole ""oh, but he voluntarily left"" crap is just that, crap. Not something that somehow makes their actions constitutional.

I sympathize with the pro-European elements of the protests (although absolutely not with the current government), but that doesn't mean that every action taken by the opposition is automatically legitimate, lawful or moral. All of these things have to be considered independent of each other, and of independent of personal biases. And such a consideration shows that the coup was *unconstitutional*. In itself, that may say very little about its *moral* validity or the legitimacy of the resulting government, but that doesn't change the facts.

true,Jaquestrap,UNSA,United States of America,"Well obviously as a part of the Visegrad Group the Czech Republic is bound by alliances with Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary (all of which share borders with Ukraine) to come to their aid in case of an attack. Not to mention it being a part of NATO which means it is likewise again bound to provide military aid to the aforementioned countries, as well as the other Eastern European NATO nations of Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. This really isn't exactly ""new"" information, this is all a given.

Also, with it's relatively small air force (only 163 total aircraft/helicopters, and as splergel laid out below only 31 combat-ready fighter jets and 12 attack helicopters) the Czech Republic wouldn't really lead a hypothetical Eastern European defense effort nor would it contribute all that much with it's military--Poland would be the country to take the lead (obviously after the U.S.) considering it's not only much more substantial military (Poland has invested much more in bolstering, training, and supplying it's troops with up-to-date hardware than any other Eastern European nation since the fall of the USSR), but also the level of experience that Polish troops and their command have both in combat situations (due to Poland's very significant contributions to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as numerous other operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Haiti, Pakistan, Lebanon, the First Gulf War, etc) and in coordinating efforts/working together with major NATO armed forces, notably the U.S., UK, Australia, France, Germany, Canada, and Italy--which in a hypothetical war in Eastern Europe would be vital.

However where the Czech Republic would provide the most amount of aid is through logistics, by providing Western nations with an excellent staging ground and avenue through which to move troops, supplies, and coordinate military operations. The Czech Republic has even more serviceable airports than it's neighbor Poland, combined with modern infrastructure and highway, as well as the fact that due to it's location and geography it would not be an battle-zone (though it is still further east than Germany) make it an excellent candidate for the aforementioned roles.",0,1395598825,null,0,false,0,cg9we4a,t3_215ddu,t1_cg9we4a,t3_215ddu,null,1433033688,41,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,41

Depending on what you mean by the money thing: the Simon scandal does not. Noone is doubting that the money is his, only the origins of it is questionable. It's not secret Socialist campaign money.

As for Fidesz spending twice over the legal limit (they are now over 2bn Fts, roughly 6.5M€, while the limit is 1bn, 3.2M€), it's again only terrible in the light of democracy and taking law seriously. 

It never was really a question that Fidesz is going to win this election again, the question only was whether they do it with a 2/3rd mandate supermajority again or not. Since they [gerrymandered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) the electoral districts for their own profit, even if only 55% of all votes go for Fidesz, that still grants them over 70% of the mandates (because the overwhelming majority of individual MP spots will be won by them) and the supermajority in question.

The Socialist campaign was supposed to prevent that, but they ran it so terribly and so many scandals broke out (all conveniently timed for elections season),I believe even that is out of the question already.

Now the new strategy is what Fidesz used in 2006: ""let the opposing party run the next 4 years again and hope it's going to be so terrible by the end that we'll win the next elections by a landslide"".

EXACTLY. 
Facts are you are condoning genital mutilation without consent for a slim chance that some of these children may have health issues easily remedied by usage of condoms and washing themselves.

2. It got a lot of flak because of two highly publicized crashes with early prototypes. Not a record which stands out among its competitors, it had some major problems with it's fly-by-wire systems which caused both crashes. The difference though was that both were extremely publicizied and televised; one crashed in the middle of Stockholm (no causalties) while showing off maneuvers during the Water Festival which was witnessed by tens of thousands of spectators.

Croats were killing other Croats during that war, and those who won established the borders we have today.

&gt; the fact that the Croatian Parliament had never sanctioned the decision of the National Council of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs to unite with Serbia and Montenegro in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (1 December 1918), subsequently (3 October 1929) proclaimed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia;

true,vernazza,HUNG,Glorious Workers' Democracy by Viktor,"No, I wouldn't call the Socialists poor by any standards, they are one of the two big parties that have been around since forever and they don't have any more problems campaigning that anyone else in the opposition. 

The governing party is always miles ahead in this kind of situation, but that's unavoidable. For example it can and had happened that a Fidesz-backed billboard campaign's technical details came to light, and the billboard company charged them 10% of the standard rental fee. It was obviously legal, because they charge whatever they like, but it's obviously dubious.

Jobbik in comparison regularly complains that they simply do not have the funds to match the level of media involvement of the other two.

Fidesz did the exact same thing you are describing, the bigger half of their ""campaign"" is supposedly ""public announcements"", but they do it ridiculously. The campaign billboards, funded by Fidesz money and the ""public announcement"" ones, funded by government money use the same color schematics, the orange of Fidesz (the party color) matched with an azure blue. And there is a slogan for the public announcement ones that replaces the party logos and such, it says ""Hungary is performing better"", which was a slogan used by the very beginning of their governance, and back then it was a clear throwback for the Socialist government. So in people's minds the slogal actually goes like ""Hungary is performing better - than during the Socialist government"".

They are ridiculously populist and made basic, but very strong measures that had visible effect in everyday life, assuring continued support from the average voters who know nothing about politics and economy. What they care about is that Fidesz lowered their utility bills, they don't care about what negative things may happen in the future because of just that. But that's really quite the same for other party supporters as well, they are just short-sighted in different ways. 

Also, what Fidesz truly mastered is the polarization of people. In their last 3 years, they were continuously running with an ""us vs. them"" mentality when it came to debating anyone. IMF: kicked out, EU: told to f*ck off several times, multinational banks: hit with heavy, newly invented taxes. They are really acting like Hungary is the sole victim of international economy, that everyone is out there to get us, everyone wants to hurt little, innocent, flawless Hungary and that they are the white knights defending it. And sadly, people are buying this shit. 

In short: people are stupid. ",0,1395604253,null,0,1395604448,0,cg9yp7y,t3_2152vu,t1_cg9yp7y,t1_cg9ye6a,null,1433034776,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

For comparison, I pay EUR 750 per year for my professional liability insurance and I am a lawyer. Based on the amount of money spent on professional liability insurance for a midwife last year (I checked the statistics), it costs EUR 4480 per year.

So that means that a midwife generates 590% more liability than I do.

What you are suggesting then is that the public treasury pay for this liability, since the free market is unable to do so using normal mechanisms?

Why should I, as a citizen and taxpayer, be OK with bearing this risk?

Just using your logic against you.

&gt; modern day Croatia was built on the Partisan movement in WWII, that started in Croatia and for a large period has Croats as a majority.

Most of the Croatian partisans were from Dalmatia (which Pavelic gave to Italy). Croats started forming a majority of Croatian partisan units in 1943 after Tito offered complete amnesty to collaborators from the Croatian Home Guard and the Ustasha if they switch sides and join Partisans. [Here's a source in Croatian](http://www.tomislavjonjic.iz.hr/III_komunisti_12.pdf)

&gt; Republic of Srpska never existed in any form 

Republic of Srpska is an entity of Serbs living in Bosnia and Herzegovina. So basically a serbian state within Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Serbs didn't just show up from nowhere in the 90s killed or expelled Croats or Bosniaks and created their own state. No.
 
Serbs were living  in Bosnia and Herzegovina continously since they arrived to the Balkans in the 6th century and and from that time onwards formed various states on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The first king of Bosnia Tvrtko I titled himself king of the Serbs.

Do you know the etymology of Herzegovina? The early name of Herzegovina was Hum, but in the 15th century Stephen Vukcic change it's nam to the Duchy(Herzegovina) of Saint Sava. In case you don't know your Serbian history Saint Sava was the founder of the Serbian Orthodox Church.

Opposizione trattenendo il parlamento anche nottate intere per far passare emendamenti su leggi presenti. Non sono al governo e non credo possano fare di più se non questo. 

&gt;Quali punti del programma hanno portato avanti?

Hanno tentato con la legge anticorruzione, stanno presentando una proposta di legge elettorale (alla buon'ora), il tentativo di eliminare l'IRAP per le piccole imprese, più tutte le volte che hanno fatto opposizione su provvedimenti come il salva Roma o la storia dei soldi a bankitalia (dove però hanno fatto opposizione per il motivo sbagliato) e le mozioni di sfiducia di fronte a casi particolarmente gravi. Personalmente io li avevo votati per questo, per fare opposizione sulle porcate e non mi hanno deluso su questo punto di vista. Anche perché, personalmente, non mi aspettavo più del 15%.

&gt;Chi sono gli esperti che li aiutano a scrivere le leggi, visto che i ""cittadini"" parlamentari sono ""semplici portavoce"" e **sono stati diverse volte smentiti/bloccati quando ci provavano? 
**

Questo è falso. Qui ci sono i disegni di legge scritti di pugno dai deputati 5 stelle o a cui hanno partecipato in congiunzione ad esponenti di altri partiti: http://www.senato.it/ric/sddl/risultati.do?params.commissioneBoolOp=AND&amp;params.statoDiv=1,0,0,1,0,0,1&amp;des=&amp;params.parlamentareIniziativaBoolOp=AND&amp;selmode=&amp;params.campoOrdinamento=dataPresentazione&amp;params.interventiBoolOp=AND&amp;params.tipoIniziativa=1&amp;params.gruppoTrattazioneBoolOp=AND&amp;params.rows=10&amp;params.parlamentareIniziativa=GRC117&amp;livelloTeseo=&amp;params.teseoTuttiTermini=T&amp;params.relatoriBoolOp=AND&amp;params.start=20&amp;params.legislatura=17&amp;params.tipoFirmatari=1&amp;teseo=&amp;sel=&amp;params.ordinamento=desc

L'unica volta in cui ricordo un parlamentare bloccato è stata la questione sul reato di clandestinità perché non tutti coloro che hanno votato i cinque stelle sono d'accordo sulla questione in quanto non discussa esplicitamente sul programma.

true,Deusdies,EART,Earth,"Well here's the thing that I tell to my American friends as well: you can't think of yourself as objectively as someone from another country has. The US (or any other country for that matter) is not the ""largest democracy"" (just an example) if they say so. They're the largest democracy if OTHERS say so.

So if I, for example, (and my experience doesn't come simply from tourists, I spent quite a bit of time in England) and a bunch of other people from /r/europe tell you one thing, then it should probably make you wonder and say ""hey, is this really the case?"" And not ask your friends and say ""well yeah, this is obviously not the case"". 

For example I remember the speech Tony Blair gave once, I think it was something about G20 meeting, and one professor asked him ""what cultural treats are we [he is an American] and you willing to change in order to globalize the world more effectively, i.e. in order to approach other G20 countries such as China, Saudia Arabia etc., who are possibly not willing to accept all our ""cultural demands""?""

Blair looks and says ""I don't think we need to make any changes because we're supposed to project our culture on them"" (don't actually quote me on this, but it was definitely along the lines of ""we're superior to them, so we shouldn't make any changes - they should""). Now whatever your personal opinion of Blair may be, he was elected by your people. 

See, here comes my (possibly biased?) perspective. I was born and raised in Serbia. There was a time when Milosevic was the president. He was an evil man in my opinion. he did a lot of evil in the region. But guess what - the people, *my* people, elected him. Legitimately. And despite MASSIVE protests (where at one point he brought up tanks on the streets of Belgrade), guess what happened at the elections? He won. Marginally, sometimes, but still a victory.

Serbia has a very similar problem as Britain does. There's a huge chunk of people who still dream of ""Greater Serbia"" (thankfully they're being more and more marginalized). That Kosovo has always belonged to Serbia. Now, no one in my circle of friends think that, but there's still a huge chunk of people who do. Maybe it's the same in your case? 

Except I still do believe that Britain has a bigger problem than Serbs do, because Serbia never had anything and lost whatever it little had, and Britain had everything and lost... well almost everything.

And everything the midwife does ""wrong"" can also happen to a doctor - who doesn't have ~~any~~ nearly as much training in giving birth or how to care for infants, women postpartum, women before birth - not to mention the unmedical stuff they do, like listening to your fears and problems (if you ever meet a pregnant woman, you'll know how hard they can be to handle). An MDs insurance is not as high as a midwife's, esp. in relation to what they earn (usually € 250 - € 350 per birth, plus classes and visits). 

Why you as a citizen and taxpayer should not be ok with is letting untrained and unexperienced people handle an aspect of your life (given you are willing to have children one day) that is this sensitive. Plus, it is a woman's right to chose how she wants to give birth: be it in a clinic, at home or in a birthing center, medicated, unmedicated, standing upright, in water or however it pleases her. Doctors usually go for the c-section because it's quick and expensive or other interventions that can cause trauma in the women's birthing experience, thus being a case for the taxpayer because they might need therapy for postpartum depression. Which, if the woman is properly taken care of and feels safe, doesn't arise.

true,Jaquestrap,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; And Czech Republic (public &amp; most politicians) have exactly zero wish to participate in any conflict. Don't mistake empty words for actions.

That may be so, but as a member of NATO the Czech Republic is bound under no uncertain terms to treat an attack on one NATO nation as an attack on itself. Should war break out and a member of NATO be attacked, I guarantee you that regardless of public opposition to war, Czech military forces would be deployed to at least the minimum extent necessary to meet it's obligations under NATO requirements. 

Forfeiting on NATO obligations after a member is attacked would have massive repercussions and consequences for the Czech Republic (like it would for any NATO ally) as it would directly renege on a multitude of well-defined international obligations; drastically inhibit if not destroy its international diplomatic reputation--as well as ruin it's relations with virtually every other NATO country (unless they too reneged on their obligations); would leave the Czech Republic without any aid, backing, and support from NATO countries not only militarily (which would leave it completely on it's own in the event that war reached it) but also economically and diplomatically (after going back on as binding an obligation as NATO, you can bet that virtually all NATO members would cut off or suspend economic treaties with the Czech Republic as punishment and due to lack of trust); would cause intense division in the Czech government and military; and even potentially open up the Czech Republic to sanctions and in the case of a hypothetical Eastern European war, military action by NATO in order to secure vital strategic interests in the region. If a massive ground war between NATO and a resurgent Russia broke out then the Czech Republic would gain little from refusing to join the fight as inevitably the fight would be brought to them regardless, and then it would have only earned the overwhelming enmity of most of the rest of Europe as well as the United States, Canada, and Australia for reneging on it's treaties and weakening the solidarity of NATO in the face of violent aggression.

And don't underestimate the effect that conflict close to home can have on the opinions of the people. Maybe the Czechs are opposed to any conflict now, but if Russia were to start attacking NATO members in Eastern Europe (as highly unlikely as that is) I can almost guarantee that support for war against Russia would grow very significantly in the Czech Republic.

&gt; According to TVP (Polish national TV), the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs received an **official letter from the State Duma of the proposed division of the territory of Ukraine**. Poland was proposed to take the western districts. - It's just a sick mind can come up with - commented on the matter adviser to the president, prof. Presidential adviser.
Vice-Chairman of the State Duma and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia Vladimir Zhirinovsky has already said that Poland should follow in the footsteps of Russia and demand that Ukraine ""devotion territories that are not Ukrainian."" It was difficult, however, to suppose that the words of the controversial policy actions will follow, namely - officially a letter to the Polish Foreign Ministry.

&gt; Zhirinovsky: let Poland make a call for a referendum

&gt; Vladimir Zhirinovsky proposes to Poland demanded a referendum on the accession of our country to the five western regions of Ukraine: Volyn, Lviv, iwanofrankowskiego, Ternopil and Rivne. A similar ""offer"" got Hungary and Romania ws. Carpathian circuits and Chernivtsi. Within Ukraine would remain only its central part.

&gt; Such opinions expressed Zhirinovsky after the Crimean referendum, arguing that ""it is time to not only Russian lands were returned under the Russian flag."" - The lands of western Ukraine in the time of Stalin's regime were correctly attached to the Soviet Union. The idea was to stop the German armies as far as possible (from the borders of the Soviet Union). But it was not the Russian lands, they were not Ukrainian lands - said then.

&gt; In a letter sent to the Polish Foreign Ministry Zhirinovsky argues that within the limits of Ukrainian nationality were large differences in the mentality that they can not live together. ""Mutual dislike for many years accompanied by open conflicts, often transforming itself into a bloody massacre - entire villages were annihilated during the brutal fighting between Polish and Ukrainian nationalists"" - writes. It is worth noting that the father of the Zhirinovsky came from western Ukraine.

&gt; ""The proposals are eccentric...""

&gt; - Proposals are so peculiar that no one takes them seriously - says Marcin Wojciechowski Foreign Ministry spokesman, confirming that there is indeed such a letter from the Russian Duma received. - Vladimir Zhirinovsky will get a courtesy reply, without reference to the content of your letter - Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced. - Part of the Russian elite still thinks in terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact - sums Wojciechowski.

&gt; - It is outrageous to propose Poland, as experienced changes in boundaries, participation in the partition of a friendly country. It's just a sick mind can come up with - said in a BBC adviser to the President of Poland - Actually, this letter would be sent to a psychiatrist - he added.

&gt;how low the complication rates are, the non-existent serious side effects. No reduction in performance

Like I said, very nice. But...    

&gt;Minor health benefits

That are at best so minor they're not worth it, at worst complete bullshit. Seriously, of all developed countries only americans eat this shit up, and they are made fun of because of it. If circumcision was as worth it as you think it is, don't you think the practice would be widespread in more first world countries? I am more enclined to believe that it was popularised in america by bible-thumpers who didn't want boys to experience satanic masturbation, and they made up all these studies to support their claim.    

&gt;still think it's mutilation

Pick up a dictionary. Definition of mutilation: ""To make imperfect by excising or altering parts"". I didn't make this up.    

&gt;It's not disfiguring. There's no permanent damage

Possibly the stupidest thing you've said this whole argument. Do you really need me to define what ""permanent"" means? Or do you have the ability to grow skin, because if you do you need your own TV show. You'd make millions.

&gt;There aren't millions of kids growing up hating their parents for maiming them

Of course not, since they're taught it's a normal thing to do from the beginning. And it's done when they're babies, so they conveniently can't say no and forget the pain growing up. It's very telling that they have to do this to people when they're incapable of refusing, don't you think? I don't have the numbers on adult circumcision without religious motive, but I would guess it's quite negligible. Because adults know better than to have a doctor take a blade to their junk.

From my personal interactions in day to day life, most people have jaded views of globalization, multi-national corporations, banks and government.

People here don't understand US foreign policy and view any kind of interventionist rhetoric with a conspiratorial mindset. Blue collar baby boomers look back fondly on the JFK, Eisenhower presidencies as a sort of golden age when government functioned in a honest manner and jobs were plentiful.

It's hard to blame people for having that attitude though. Wages have been stagnant here in the US for decades and the real national unemployment rate probably stands at around 15%. Add in the mix of government scandals and gross incompetence with things like healthcare reform, it is no wonder why civic engagement has eroded to the point it has.

From Paris, you can take a train from the St-Lazare train station headed straight for Caen (those for Cherbourg also stop in Caen on the way, combined, it's about one train every hour). Train ticket price ranges between 30 to 40€. Buy early to reduce the prices. Travel duration: 1h45.

You can spend a whole day in Caen: first of all, it's a very nice city, nicknamed ""the city of a hundred steeples"". It has about twenty churches ranging from the 7th to the 20th century, including the infamous Abbaye-aux-Hommes, from which is said that if the church was ever to collapse, the whole British Monarchy would fall along with it. Don't know if it's true, but there's the tomb of William the Conqueror inside. There is also a nice castle with museums.

The reason you may want to spend the whole day in, though, is for the Memorial, which is one of the biggest WW2 museums in the world. I **never** managed to do it in its entirety, usually giving up after spending five to six hours in and realizing I'm not even halfway through. Money well spent, even though it's 15 to 20€ (!).

From Caen, you got multiple options, as there are like fifty WW2 museums in Normandy. You'd probably like to see the WW2 beaches. With public transport, two options: you can go to Ouistreham (Sword Beach), which is where the WW2 ceremonies will happen this year (with Obama and the others). It is on Caen's urban bus lines, so just take bus 61 or 62, it's 1,35€ a ticket and a 15 minutes trip.

The second option, which I also recommend, is to take the train from Caen to Bayeux (15 minutes, 5 to 6€). In Bayeux, there is obviously the Bayeux Tapestry. And a nice cathedral. But there are also (private companies) coaches that can take you to the other WW2 beaches than Ouistreham. You might want to Google that, though, as I never really looked into it.

Come to think of it, there are also public coaches. /u/Kedarwynn gave you [a useful link on nice touristic things to visit for WW2](http://normandy.memorial-caen.com/organise-your-visit/on-your-own-with-family-or-with-friends/touristic-sites-visited), and I will give you another useful link: [map of public coaches lines in the area](http://www.busverts.fr//upload/plan/BUS-VERTS-Plan-Janvier2014.pdf). Arromanches, the artificial harbor, is on line 74 departing from Bayeux, and La Pointe du Hoc (and many beaches) are on line 70, still from Bayeux. Hours of departure ? [Line 70](http://www.busverts.fr/upload/fiches_horaires/L70S2.pdf) ([way back](http://www.busverts.fr/upload/fiches_horaires/L70S1.pdf)) and [Line 74](http://www.busverts.fr/upload/fiches_horaires/L74S2.pdf) ([way back](http://www.busverts.fr/upload/fiches_horaires/L74S1.pdf)). Price of the coaches range between 1 and 16€ depending on length of trip, I'd say between 3 to 7€ for trips on line 70 and 74. **Have change on you**, coaches don't take credit card.

Now, if you don't have much more time after spending those two to three days in Normandy, I'd recommend finishing with Le Mont St Michel before heading to Brittany. And you're lucky, it's on the way! Just take the train bound to Rennes from either Caen or Bayeux (about 20€, three hours of travel). Get out of the train in Pontorson. **Beware**, there are ""roadworks"" on the train tracks, so getting there by train will be a bitch. But it's also the only way if you don't have a car. [Here are the train hours](http://telechargement.ter-sncf.com/Images/Basse_Normandie/Tridion/Horaires_Caen_Rennes_du_15_d%C3%A9c_2013_au_02_mars__et_du_05_avril_au_5_juil_2014_\(mise_%C3%A0_jour_18_mars\)_tcm-14-97450.pdf).

When you're done with le Mont Saint Michel, just keep going on the train the same way you were headed untill Rennes. I'll then let a redditor from Brittany tell you what you can see there, because I can't. I'm from Normandy. It's like Brits and Scots. Their regional cake is a [raw butter brick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kouign-amann), for crying out loud!

So here it is: three to four days in Normandy. If you want more... A nice medieval castle in Falaise, check bus line 35 from Caen ([time schedule](http://www.busverts.fr/upload/fiches_horaires/L35S2.pdf), [way back](http://www.busverts.fr/upload/fiches_horaires/L35S1.pdf))... If you want to visit a real nuclear submarine, +an aquarium, +a nice exhibition on the Titanic, along with two WW2 museums, you might want to check Cherbourg (train from Caen or Bayeux, about 20€, 1h travel time, one train every hour. Titanic/aquarium/submarine is about the same price as the Memorial in Caen.) If you want less, skip the coaches part from Bayeux.

There are much more things to see in Normandy, but it would sadly require a car.

Why has it been ridden roughshod by pretty much everybody (with the notable exception of Suarez!) since 1978?

I would say, remember she is going to be with you to experience America and American life, so don't go too far with making her feel comfortable. Treat her as an American guest, but with the added caveat that if there are things she doesn't like, or complaints she has, or misunderstandings that may arise, there's probably a cultural reason for that.

Germans tend to be a little more direct than Americans, and they tend not to be too shy about explaining what irks them. They will, however, be polite about it. They'll only show overt enthusiasm if they're really enthusiastic about something: if she doesn't, she may be perfectly happy, she just doesn't feel the situation warrants jumping for joy.

Germans usually find overt shows of patriotism unsettling. Of course, if her teachers have done their job properly, she'll be expecting flags everywhere and the Pledge of Allegience and all that stuff, but she might want to criticize it. Blame the Nazis for making them nervous about patriotism.

Germans hold eye contact longer than Americans do. It's a matter of split seconds, but if she starts to feel that Americans are avoiding her or being evasive, that's likely the reason. Americans may feel she's staring at them all the time.

She'll be bowled over at getting her very own bathroom. The concept of a ""master bedroom"" is almost unknown in Germany.

Germans like to think of themselves as tolerant and open-minded -- they feel they have a lot to make up for after the whole Third Reich thing. They may have lots of harsh criticisms about American politics, but won't usually let it get in the way of personal relationships. She's not criticizing you, she's talking about what is done in your name by your government, and the two are separate things.

The advice about her shutting her door is correct. The reason is that Germany is a much more densely populated country and the houses usually smaller (most Germans live in rented apartments), so privacy is at a premium.

I've never yet met a German who went to America and didn't thoroughly enjoy it. A lot depends on her personal tastes and frame of mind, but assuming she actually wants to visit America, everything about it is going to be new and exciting (although some of her experiences will be negative -- but that's to be expected). All the things you find ordinary and mundane will be for her exotic.

Take your student grocery shopping once she gets here. Being able to point and chose can help overcome said cultural shock. Also, Walmart does not exist in Germany, might be an experience for her.

If you and your husband are up for, try learning some German, even if it is just names of items around the house. Even though German students have studied English at school longer than average American students study their foreign languages, being put in a total immersion situation can be a bit intimidating. Trying to learn German from her and showing interest could be comforting. 

Also, it might help her getting used to everything here, if she has time to settle in and get to know a few people at a time. I used to get very irritated from what I think was some kind of sensory overload, especially in situations where multiple people were present and talking to each other and me. But that might no be an issue if she is coming with an exchange organization and they already had their meet and greet week and a half somewhere on the east coast.

I don't think age will be that much of a cultural shock. Your visitor might actually enjoy it and think it is ""cool"" to have young exchange parents. But regardless, I'm sure she will make friends at your school and start being just like every other student real soon. So you and your husband might want to sit down and think of non-negotiable house rules before your exchange student gets here.

&gt;So, if I'm right in guessing you are a jew, you people need to quit acting like victims. The bible says we should stone to death adulterers and blasphemers, yet we don't do that, because we aren't bronze age barbarians anymore.

There's a slur, victim blaming, calling them ""bronze age barbarians."" I'm not sure how you could get much more anti-semitic without bringing up ovens and Hitler.

&gt;That are at best so minor they're not worth it

Yet I've shown that there are health benefits and even fewer negative health effects. Enough data that the choice is definitely debatable. You've shown nothing. Cite a source. Give me some data, show me some scientific studies. So far I've seen none of that from you. 

You honestly think studies publicized by the centers for disease control, the world health organization, american medical association etc. In the last couple decades are just anti masturbation propaganda? Even when the same organizations research on male masturbation shows that it has benefits like reducing chances of prostate cancer and has no recommendation for males of any age to quit masturbating as long as they're healthy? 

What dictionary is that from? ""inflict a violent and disfiguring injury on."" is googles definition. Merriam-webster says, "" to cause severe damage to (the body of a person or animal)"" 

There is no permanent damage. There is a permanent change, it however is non damaging. There is no damage done. It is not violent. It is not disfiguring. Get this through your thick skull.

There are, sadly, good reasons why insurance cost has skyrocketed.

See: http://www.dggg.de/leitlinienstellungnahmen/aktuelle-stellungnahmen/?eID=dam_frontend_push&amp;docID=2298

Non-hospital births are risky. A **lot** more risky than most pregnant women and independent midwives would like to believe.

A non-hospital birth more than doubles the risk of perinatal death and most women are not informed of that risk by their midwives when they make that decision.

The risk of permanent disabilities also increases massively.

And ultimately, from a purely financial point, it's the midwife's insurance that has to pay for these increased risks. Paying for a disabled infant for the rest of his or her natural life simply is incredibly costly.

Non-independent midwifes (i.e. the ones employed by hospitals and clinics) are not directly affected by this. They won't go away, there almost certainly will have to be more of them.

And while I'm not a fan of non-hospital births for the simple facts mentioned above, independent midwifes do offer quite a lot more than this one aspect of their profession. We probably do still need them and there are probably good reasons to resolve this problem.

But I don't see how introducing laws to cap insurance premiums for an inherently and often needlessly risky part of their profession is the proper way to go.

Maybe minimizing cost by actually minimizing the risks would be the better way to go ahead.",0,1395616227,null,0,1395617018,0,cga3zc3,t3_215mc7,t1_cga3zc3,t3_215mc7,null,1433037332,21,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,21

true,Firebrass11,NAGO,Nagorno-Karabakh,"Mining has always been the main sector of Armenia's economy, and it makes up 40% of all exports.  Tourism is also a major factor, mainly due to Armenia's Christen history and nice landscape.  During its Soviet period, Armenia created a large stockpile of chemicals, machines, and foodstuffs which was traded after the breakup.  We still manufacture all of these today, but on a smaller scale.

For the economic growth, Armenia had a construction boom, which lowered unemployment.  Investments and finance was the other main source of growth, but was squashed during the market crash, which is probably one of the reasons why Armenia has been lagging.

Armenia's geographic location is also terrible, despite it being on Armenians historical land.

Government corruption is probably the reason why Armenia is practically in pieces today.  The taxing and land re-possession system needs to be revamped.  Monopolies are pretty much doing whatever they want without restrictions...  The government needs to change.

Personally, the biggest problems I had on my exchange visit to the (southern) US was the lack of ""real"" food. A lot of it I found to be synthetic, engineered, overly sweet stuff. I vividly remember the lack of proper breakfast.

After a couple of days of being served frozen microwaved breakfast food, I politely requested buying bread. They got me a foot long loaf of white ""bread""/toast so soft you could squish it down to an inch. And why was it so sweet? Also, there was nothing to eat that thing with except for more random sweet material.

That's exactly something a really far-left person would say, yes when you live in Beijing you don't consider your homeland as the Far East but that's what it is to most of the world.

2009 elections: SPD 23%, Die Linke 12%
/ 2013 elections: SPD 26%, Die Linke 8,5%

? 
Seems it's not the ""neo-liberals"" that crashed.

&gt; It is unfortunate in my view that the electoral base is moving to the right, but it's still a backlash against liberalism

What the hell, please explain this to me. Does for instance the PP have an absolute majority in the Spanish parliament because of the ""backlash against liberal capitalism"" ? 

You just seem to be purposefully out of touch with reality because that suits your ideological way of thinking... stop it
