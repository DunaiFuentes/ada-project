false,olifante,PORT,Portugal,"left Lisbon 17 months ago to work in Berlin. Work is somewhat less stressful and more organized here, the pay is 50% better and Berlin is only about 15% more expensive than Lisbon. Berlin might not be the most beautiful city in Europe, but the residential neighbourhoods are quite charming, very calm and laid-back and packed with bars, restaurants and cultural venues. Berlin is also a very youthful city, and you can see that young people from all over Europe are flocking here in droves. Oh, and it's filled with great parks and surrounded by tons of beautiful lakes.

My oral and written German understanding is good, but I'm not yet completely fluent. It's possible to live in Berlin without knowing much German, but you will be a bit cut off from the local scene unless you go for the expat lifestyle. Interacting with the bureaucracy and public servants will definitely be painful if you don't know German.

Still trying to understand how to correctly socialize here, Berliners are quite different from Portuguese people. No great love for idle chit-chat, interactions seem to be more group-oriented than one-on-one, and people are a bit more introvert or shy than back in Portugal. However, Berliners among themselves can be a quite happy bunch, and the cafés and bars are packed all over the city. All in all a great experience, although I will probably go back to my homecity, wonderful Lisbon.",0,1416953769,null,0,1416953972,0,cmd0lxe,t3_2neo9x,t1_cmd0lxe,t3_2neo9x,null,1425841547,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

* Labour - I don't feel like I can vote for Labour because I really don't like Ed Miliband. They've lost their status as being a party run by common people *for* common people. They're all Oxbridge elitists just like the Tories. But I generally agree with most of their policies.

* Conservatives - I don't really mind David Cameron and I do think we need a *slightly* tighter approach to things like immigration but I don't support the anti-EU and pro-privatisation stance that the Conservatives are taking. I definitely don't like what they're doing to the NHS right now.

* UKIP - We all know about these guys. They are anti-EU and pro-privatisation as well, but they hold the added 'bonus' of being anti-environment and having a lot of insane policies which don't even make sense.

* Liberal Democrats - I'm socially left-wing but economically right-wing so they ideally are the party I'm looking for. They are the ones I would have voted for last time if I was old enough. Now though, they've lost my support thanks to their hypocrisy and the back-pedaling on their main promises.

* Greens - Some of their less known policies range from being quite far-fetched to outright implausible. It's a shame really, because we definitely need to focus more on things like improving sustainability and reducing pollution. The Greens seem to be the only party who are treating these issues with the severity they deserve. I reckon that when it comes round to the next general election I will vote Green as a protest.

**TL:DR** - All of them have positive aspects (except UKIP) but I don't really feel able to agree with any of them enough to vote for them to get into power. I'll probably protest vote Green.",0,1416953780,null,0,1416954146,0,cmd0m5l,t3_2nd1af,t1_cmd0m5l,t3_2nd1af,null,1425841544,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Dans la première situation, la jurisprudence exige toujours la preuve d'erreur du solvens. Dans la seconde, depuis un arrêt d’assemblée plénière du 2 avril 1993, la jurisprudence énonce que contrairement à ce qu’établit l’article 1377 du code civil, **il n'est plus nécessaire de prouver une erreur du solvens. Le solvens devra seulement prouver l'absence de cause du paiement.**

-Crime. It is common knowledge that unskilled migrants are overrepresented in crime statistics.

-Values. If you do not control the quality and quantity of migrants or ask them to integrate, then they WON'T integrate. They will bring the values of the countries they came from, have the same democratic voice as you or I, and thus make Germany more like their old countries

-Contribution to economy. You might think that everyone who works is contributing, but this is not the case. Germany is a welfare state.

&gt; *Do you think that your country's relationship with Russia should be affected by tension between Russia and NATO or Russia's actions against other European states, or should France only look out for its self-interest when dealing with Russia?*

La relation entre la France — et le reste de l’Europe — est affectée par les actions de la Russie. La tension entre l’OTAN et la Russie est la conséquence de l’invasion russe en Ukraine (pour « libérer » une minorité russophone… en faisant disparaitre celle tartare), et non la cause.

Face à la Russie, la réponse de la France ne devrait être conçue que dans le cadre de l’Union européenne. Problème : il n’y a pas de réelle diplomatie européenne, car plusieurs pays — notamment l’UK — n’en veulent pas. Donc c’est la bazar, et des groupes de pays agissent séparément des autres : c’est l’Europe à plusieurs vitesses. 

&gt; *Do you think that Russia and France have a beneficial relationship that is worth preserving, and if so, what is the nature of that relationship?*

La relation historique de la France avec la Russie était à la période des tsars; aujourd’hui, l’orientation politique et culturelle de ce pays a beaucoup changé. La France se consacre davantage à ses partenaires européens — ce qui est la moindre des choses — donc il est possible que la Russie se sente un peu délaissée par ses voisins. À sa gauche, les pays de l’Union européenne. À sa droite, la Chine et ses satellites. Il reste au centre à la Russie les Stans, mais ceux-ci ne sont pas peuplés de russes… On comprend toute la problématique de la Russie, ne voulant/pouvant s’ancrer ni à l’Ouest ni à l’Est.

Des relations positives fortes entre pays sont toujours positives pour la paix et l’économie, mais la Russie doit se faire à l’idée que le monde a changé avec le développement de l’Union européenne.


&gt; *Do you perceive Russia as a useful or moral counterbalance to the United States?*

MWOUHAHAHA ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Non.

En parlant de moral, nous attendons toujours que la Russie nous rembourse l’argent que nous lui avons prêté (les fameux [emprunts russes](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emprunt_russe)). Donc quand elle nous menace de d’amende financière pour la possible rupture d’un contrat d’armement, cela nous fait sourire 😬

[From the last thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2n6adt/any_expats_living_in_europe_which_country_are_you/cmb1pkl?context=3) :

for a long time I felt that I wasn't born on the right country and out of sync with the ""Tunisian/arab mind set"" without going in more detail, I was fed up with the negative climate I was living in and decided to go to Europe with one rule in mind : avoid staying in Tunisian circle at all cost and blend in with as much other culture as possible.

at that time I got a good work offer in Paris, a cosmopolitan city that may offer what I was looking for so I went there (it seems easy like this but the procedure can drive you crazy).

turn out it was the best desicion I ever made, I had a lot of new experiences, met a bunch of new people and friend from all the world (that I'm still in touch with), learned two more language and improved the previous one, worked in top firm in my discipline and on things that I enjoyed doing.

I liked very much living in Paris but I wanted to try another country and went to the canary during the summer, it was also an excellent descion and an incredible experience, I worked, partied hard and met another bunch of people.

Now I'm back to Paris because I have an excellent job where I do what I love and also I'm studying part-time stuff that I love but I'm still young so I want to try an Anglophone country because I never tried that before and from what I'm hearing about them I feel I could totally fit in.",0,1416955122,null,0,false,0,cmd1c6h,t3_2neo9x,t1_cmd1c6h,t3_2neo9x,null,1425841135,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

We do use third person singular as  formal mode all the time, but while brazillians include the pronoun você, we will go to many lengths to avoid it.

Post Brexit, the question that Scotland faces will be a different one. While scots are on balance more proEU than the English are, the difference is exaggerated. There are many scots who would like to stay in the EU, but would rather be in the UK than the EU if it came to that choice.

But I oppose that, as do many others with me. The EU is also founded on the basis of pluralism and because of that it is important to keep Britain on board. We cannot deny the history that Britain shares with the rest of the European continent, nor should we simply accept that our ways have grown apart. Add to that who is funding UKIP for example, and the power of the tabloids, and there is yet another reason to strongly urge the British people to vote clearly 'no'.

But we'll see what happens. Boy David first got to prove that he can win the elections. Even if he manages to pull that off, any referendum regarding the EU will likely still result in a no vote because of the opinion poll/voting discrepancy I described some days ago.

&gt;Do you think that your country's relationship with Russia should be affected by tension between Russia and NATO or Russia's actions against other European states, or should France only look out for its self-interest when dealing with Russia?


The relationship between France - and the rest of Europe - is affected by the actions of Russia. The tension between NATO and Russia is the consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (to ""liberate"" a Russian-speaking minority ... making it disappear tartare), not the cause.

To Russia, the response of France should not be conceived as part of the European Union. Problem: there is no real European diplomacy, as several countries - including the UK - do not want. So this is the bazaar, and groups of countries act separately from the others: it is a multi-speed Europe.

&gt;Do you think that Russia and France have a beneficial relationship that is worth preserving, and if so, what is the nature of that relationship?

The historic relationship between France and Russia was the period of the Tsars; Today, the political and cultural orientation of this country has changed. The France focuses more on its European partners - which is the least of it - so it is possible that Russia feels somewhat abandoned by her neighbors. To his left, the countries of the European Union. To his right, China and its satellites. It remains central to Russia's Stans, but they are not populated by Russian ... We understand the whole issue of Russia, not wanting / or can be anchored to the West or the East.

Strong positive relationships between countries are always positive for peace and the economy, but Russia should be the idea that the world has changed with the development of the European Union.

&gt; Do you perceive Russia as a useful or moral counterbalance to the United States?

Você is not rude on itself, particularly when coming from a foreigner ( and you will always be tagged as a foreigner, it is unlikely your accent will be matched to anything local). Foreigners have different usages, it is expected. Brazillians use você for everything and everybody, and no offense is meant or taken. My point was just about the way portuguese portuguese handles the formal-informal mode.

For portuguese, if you are using the third person singular as a formal mode, it is more polite to either express respect (o senhor, a senhora doutora) or personalize it, or just use no pronoum at all (""precisa de ajuda?"" ""tome cuidado que o chão está escorregadio"", etc) . Você is a way to put social distance without expressing respect not acknowledging the individual person - the word vocÊ just sounds like an explicit reminder of that. Distance but no explicit respect. (Tu on the other hand, while unpolite from strangers, it implies fondness, which is why we almost universally use it with children and pets. Except when they are misbehaving)

Tu dirai che è una applicazione e non l'os, ma la distinzione è sottile - non solo per l' utente - e comunque la filosofia malata ( 0X800... Rich error code???) è la stessa ed è pervasiva. 

Quando lo avevo come desktop, i problemi che avevo erano abbastanza rari, ancorché inspiegabili, ma io non sono un utente medio, quindi non faccio testo.

Per compiti sistematici in un ecosistema linux è insopportabile. Io mi sono rotto definitivamente due anni fa e sono passato ad un desktop linux dopo decenni di win e non ho più guardato indietro. A casa ho ancora win.

false,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt;That makes me think british or irish politicians in the parliament have an advantage over everyone else. In a debate the native speaker is always going to sound more convincing, it's just not fair.

If it were a real debate, I'd perhaps agree with you. It's not a real debate, it's not intended to convince anyway. The only disadvantage is in the realm of political theatre, where struggling with English would severely cut your audience (no one likes listening to the dull interpretations, do they?) 

The bulk of the legislative work would be done in committees, people coming to agreements with others, and so on. The real action and debate take place outside the debating chamber. (Caveat, this is me just assuming that EuroParl works like most other legislatures, nothing I know of it would contradict this interpretation though.)

As an aside, Verhofstadt's English was fine, there were possibly errors but none were so glaring as to grab my attention and disrupt my train of thought. (Actually, the part about luxleaks was a bit butchered, now I think about it, but not catastrophically). 

As to a solution, the problem is that we all seem to want a perfect solution with no upper hand lent to anyone group in particular, but it simply does not exist. Any rule on which language must be used creates democratically intolerable pre-qualifications on who can be, or cannot be, elected. The only democratically acceptable rule is then for there to be a free choice in which language is used. (I guess mandating the native language would perhaps solve it in democracy terms but it would greatly disrupt how the Parliament functions (and probably enhances that persuasiveness of the English language speakers as they'll mostly be understood without the aide of translation whereas no other language will reach that wide of an audience) .)",0,1416963461,null,0,false,0,cmd5dk7,t3_2ne7ix,t1_cmd5dk7,t1_cmd37wl,null,1425839252,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

false,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"He's basically just bringing together various headlines from the past few weeks. LuxLeaks was trending on Twitter a few days ago because it turns out that Luxembourg has been doing dodgy deals with multi-national corporations to help get their taxes down (which was a shock to nobody, but now they have proof). The reason this is significant is because Juncker was PM of Luxembourg for nearly 20 years and was basically responsible for a lot of the tax operations going on in the country. 

The European Parliament was debating some sort of motion regarding whether they should announce their collective disapproval or not. ""Motions"" usually have no binding affect, but just state the majority opinion of that political body. 

The main politicians in the European Parliament criticising Juncker are the Eurosceptics, namely Mr Farage of the UK, and Marine Le Pen of France, but also a few other small ones. 

Guy Verhofstadt is the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supra-party. It's a confederation of of national parties like the Liberal Democrats and IIRC Germany's FDP party. Interestingly the UK deputy PM, Nick Clegg, used to sit in the Parliament under the leadership of Verhofstadt. Also interestedly, Verhofstadt is a former Prime Minister of Belgium. It's also worth noting that ALDE (Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe) supported Juncker in his commission candidacy, although IIRC he would have gotten in even without his support because the Social Democratic bloc (which Labour and the German SDP are members of, as well as Francois Hollande) combined with the European People's Party (of which Juncker was a direct member, and which Merkel is a constituent member, but interestingly Cameron is not, despite being a conservative party).

Verhofstadt thinks that criticising the Commission at this point in time is unwise, because we don't really know what's going on. He does kind of have a point. You shouldn't get lost in the heat of the moment nor act before you have all the facts at your disposal, but this is also a method oft used by politicians to push a problem further down the road, and hope that people forget about it by the time the report actually comes out. Remains to be seen which one it is. European Union Parliamentarians usually aren't so bothered about kicking the can down the road like national politicians and more focused on proper governance, due to the lack of a 24/7 rolling spotlight on them. 

He also refers to the story which is currently at the top of /r/europe (not that he necessarily saw it there, although two MEPs have done AMAs with us in the past, so you never know :] ) which reveals that Le Front National which is headed by Marine Le Pen is financed largely by Moscow. He also referred to the former of UKIP disowning the party he created, although this came out in the press much further in the past. Don't know who the third guy he criticised was. 

So it's a mixture really. Wasn't the most interesting speech from Verhofstadt in the World. There were some interesting points, some less interesting points.

But judging by the electoral success of Erdogan and the accepted statistics, a Turkey where secularism is dominant from Istanbul to Ankara to Batman and every rural area in between, is unlikely to make an appearance anytime soon.

As long as Turkey is strongly Islamic, I don't think it can fully fit into Europe. 

I mean when Turks look back at history, do they first look to Athens and Rome or to Mecca and Medina? Do they look to Chartres, Milan, Hamburg and Novgorod or to Baghdad, Cairo, Tunis and Aleppo? 

Then there's the lack of monasticism in Islam, which really means a lot when talking about the development of modern Europe. Monks and Nuns, living away in abbeys, priories or as secluded hermits, contributed *hugely* to the early development of science, literature, historical writings, legal philosophy, art, ethics and fundamental moral reasoning.

Not sure if they want to break Russia apart, I doubt they'd risk the destabilisation but I'm sure they would love it if it happened more or less smoothly like USSR did. 

I'm sure China wouldn't mind if US broke apart into several federations as well, provided the debts would be inherited.

After graduating high school, wasn't sure what to do with myself, moved to UK, stayed at families friends. Got a job as a kitchen porter in a hotel in Somerset, fell in love with kitchen life. Later moved to London, did the same thing. Moved back to Lithuania after a year, got some kitchen jobs, but that was it. I wanted to get some education, so I found this great culinary school in Bulgaria. So enrolled there, lived and studied in Bulgaria for 6 months then they sent me to a 6 months internships to Netherlands. LOVED IT. The bicycles, the coffee shops, well that's pretty much it. Came back to Bulgaria, to go on with my education, spent 6 months in capital - Sofia. Also LOVED IT. The last part was of the study program was 1 year internship in USA. Lived in Boston for a year, worked in one of the best french restaurants in the city. FUCKIN' LOVED IT as well :)  Now I moved in with my mom, who's living in Ireland right now, I'm working in a small hotel, trying to save up some money for future plans/ business ideas/travel. YES, travel,MORE TRAVELING. It's addictive. The experience that I had cost me some (not too much though) of money,(not a rich guy here) but it only adds up if you add it up, doesn't it? Seriously speaking,cost me some emotional stuff, like distancing from your best friends, also the place that I call home. Having said that, I never regretted not studying straight after high school, or moving around a lot. The things I saw, the people I met, even though  the connections might not last all your life but it definitely changes you as a person, especially at my age, when the world view is just developing. It gives you different attitude, different perspective towards everything, insights of human behavior, gave me some cohones too.

Also, a great pick up line/ice breaker.

Yeah, EU law allows for any 'European' country to apply for membership, provided it fulfills the requirements. For example, Morocco's application for membership was rejected, as it is not a 'European country'. Switzerland doesn't want to join, neither Norway, so that solves that. That isn't what I'm saying. Now, since Turkey's application *wasn't* rejected, it was similar to the EU officially stating that Turkey was a European country. Not only was that decision controversial, but it is also here where we see some of the arguments of the 'Eurosceptics', or the EU's 'democratic deficit'. Actually, though, I think that the EU simply wanted to avoid controversy at the time, while (remaining silent, politically correct, and) confident that Turkey would have extreme difficulty/never be able to fulfill all of the 35 chapters of the European Union accession negotiations (the so-called *aquis*). 

For example, countries like France and Cyprus have 'blocked' certain chapters from fulfillment, for various reasons.

Not sure what to tell you about what to bring for your host, I'm not as accustomed to that etiquette. My Spanish friend that had visited the USA before said he missed BBQ ribs the most lol. I once gave a Dutch friend a $1 bill because he wanted to visit America so much, and he thought that was really awesome. Other gifts might be champagne/wine, or a souvenirs from other places? I have no idea. But there are a lot of ""Taste of America"" stores in a number of Spanish cities with American food like poptarts, PB &amp; jelly, popcorn etc. anyway.

Spain is really cool; very beautiful. The best way to pack clothing is so that all of the articles go with each other so you can wear layers or take them off depending on the whether. LEARN SPANISH. Like some phrases and stuff, so you can make out signs, and it makes restaurants way easier. My first time in Europe I went to Amsterdam to study for a few weeks and I knew no Dutch and I felt really, really stupid there. I really really wished I had learned just some phrases at least.

Some things to know about Europe: water is not free, buy water cheap from convenience stores to carry around, don't buy it at restaurants. Spanish people tend to speak kind of loud, but Americans are always notable because they can be heard a mile away. Don't tip on your bills, if the service really was worthy though just round up to the nearest .50 or whole euro.

The biggest thing with traveling is to just be patient. It's hard to adjust to a different country but it's a lot easier with an open mind. I actually had a friendship ruined because a girl in the group I was traveling with was so miserable the whole time we were in Amsterdam because she felt uncomfortable.

Gern is an adverb only used on verbs that describes the verb. Adverbs do not take the place of the verb, and they come after the verb. It's used in a similar fashion as nicht. There's also nicht gern to express not liking to do something.

Subject + verb  + (nicht/auch) + gern + (objects). Parenthesis here indicate optional parts of the sentence.

Ich tanzen gern.    
Du spielst gern Fußball.    
Er hört gern Musik.    

Gerne, from what I can tell, is a colloquial use in German. However it does mean the same thing as gern, but gern is just shortened. (I'm not a native speaker by the way. My professor comes from Austria. I can ask her if you wish, PM me if you do).

To use liking something on nouns, use mögen. As in „Ich möge Orangensaft“ (Remember ALL nouns are to be capitalized). 

Modal verbs require conjugation and they all follow a similar pattern. You're also missing a few modals: dürfen, wollen, and sollen. Dürfen is used to ask permission, ""To be allowed to"" or ""may I..."". Wollen is used to express intent to do something, ""I will..."". Sollen is used to express obligation, ""I should..."".

To say ""He is allowed to play at the playground and ride is bicycle"" would be „Er darf auf dem Spielplatz spielen, und (er darf) seinen Fahrrad fahren.“ Note that the modals sit in the verb position now and that the subject and verb can carry over.

The thing to remember with modals is that they are extremely specific in intensities, and that negatives like ""darf nicht"" have different intensities as well. Example ""darf nicht"" is ""you're absolutely not allowed to ..."", while ""muss nicht"" means ""you don't necessarily have to ...""

That homework question? Möchte in this case is modal verb. You've conjugated it correctly and have sent the infinitive verb to the end. Good on that end. The sentence reply is a bit of a run-on sentence, though. I've learned to focus on understanding the use rather than trying to make complicated compound sentences that can cause me to lose points or distract from the meaning.

I hope I helped a little. I've only taken a semester of German so I may be technically wrong on something. I'm just teaching you from what I've learned.

Eben diese Leute sind es auch, welche die Flüchtlinge instrumentalisieren. Auch ist denen klar, dass ihre Forderung nach offenen Grenzen nicht umgesetzt werden kann, abrücken tun die davon aber nicht. So ist das eben, wenn man eine Lizenz zum Gelddrucken hat. Alles was man braucht sind mehr Asylanten.

Die ganzen Traumtänzer welche da fröhlich an diese profitgeilen Organisationen spenden merken gar nicht mehr, wie sehr sie den Flüchtlingen damit schaden.

Für die sind die Asylanten Verwaltungsmasse, die es möglichst kostengünstig unterzubringen und zu versorgen gilt. Staatskohle ist schließlich nicht umsonst.

Russia is just getting to taste its own medicine. Do you think neighbors of Russia have ever enjoyed an equal relationship with Russia? No, never! What has happened is that the tables have turned. In the west there is EU, the biggest economy in the world with 500 million inhabitants allied with US, the second biggest economy in the world and the only superpower. In the east there is China with fast growing economy and huge population that is destined to become the next superpower alongside USA.

The fact of the matter is that Russia is a small regional power with a decaying infrastructure, decaying army and economical and political structures more resembling a banana republic than anything else. How the hell do you think the EU, USA or China will treat Russia as an equal? It is not. The best Russia can hope is that it is left alone, and guess what, that was the case largely until the invasion to Ukraine and starting a secret war against Europe. If those things wouldn't have happened, Europe would have been happily concentrating on its economy and USA to Asia.

And in case of the 'imminent geopolitical clash', the backlash of these Russian underhanded operations, is that Putin and the regime in Kremlin are the enemies of west.

E' come dire che per imparare a leggere si fa fatica, allora facciamo i libri con le figure che tanto la storia si capisce lo stesso. Lo strumento deve essere funzionale, più aumenta la sua funzionalità più aumenta la necessità di apprendimento, è inevitabile. 

Confortare l'ignoranza delle persone non ha mai portato nulla di buono, a perte a quelli che ci fanno i soldi (e anche noi ne conosciamo uno in italia). 

Un esempio chiaro. Il mouse con un solo bottone che apple ha tentato di spacciare come migliore per decenni. Ha solo un bottone, non ti puoi confondere, più semplice, migliore, e invece è pessimo  (da notare che il mouse originale che hanno copiato aveva già 2 bottoni). Fortunatamente apple è fallita e adesso quasi tutti hanno imparato ad usare il mouse con due tasti altrimenti oggi quel basilare menu contestuale non ci sarebbe o bisognerebbe sempre avere una mano sulla tastiera per attivarlo. Da diversi anni i mouse hanno 4 - 6 tasti, e una volta che hai iniziato ad usare il terzo bottone per il ""Back"" non riesci più a farne a  meno, se invece nessuno lo fa perchè è troppo ""complesso"", molte persone più ""intelligenti"" sarebbero costrette a ripetere una azione tediosa mille volte invece di premere un semplice bottone. 

Lo strumento apparente più complesso, una volta imparato, diventa più comodo. 

Il problema di cose come l'ipad è che non semplifica l'interazione ma riduce le funzionalità. Non è una macchina con il cambio automatico (di per se già meno funzionale), ma una macchina con una sola marcia che va solo dritta. La logica apple è che nell'apriscatole meglio una manovella di 2 bottoni dove la gente deve imparare quale dei due premere. Tu ignorante ti senti felice perchè la manovella la sai far girare e non ti rendi nemmeno conto della fatica in meno che potresti fare, poi se rendi quel prodotto dominante, rovini la vita a tutti gli altri che non avrebbero avuto problemi ad imparare (il motivo per cui a volte lo ""smanettone"" ti può sembrare arrabbiato, vede la fatica che tu gli fai fare perchè non vuoi imparare a premere una michia di bottone). Senza contare che non avresti problemi ad imparare, è solo eccidia da una parte e circonvenzione di incapace dall'altra.

Poi c'è tutto un discorso sull'anti competitività, sistemi chiusi, l'evoluzione tecnologica, brand, mode, di come apple si satana e del fascismo che faceva arrivare i treni in orario... ma è meglio non iniziare.

They were though. The Nazis administered Poland for 5 years and 6 million people dissapeared, about a fourth of the population. The Soviets, during their 2 year rule, were absolutely ruthless in repressing political opponents which lead to half a million Poles being arrested or deported of which more than 100.000 were killed. The Stalinist Soviet Union was most likely one of the worst regimes in history, but it wasn't a genocidal shitheap. Also, see Generalplan Ost.

And then, unlike the Nazis, the Soviets gave the Poles a state. Which indeed fell under the Soviet influence, and was far from being perfect. But outside the Polish resistance it was the Soviets who gave the Poles a future, not the West and not the Nazis.

And my problem with Poles today is Not that they aren't kneeling and thanking the Soviet Union every single day. But that they believe it's hip and cool to denounce every thing the Soviet Union ever did and every single Red Army soldier because it makes Poland's history look a bit more heroic. You know, that tale where the poor Polish state (that certainly didn't take a slab of land filled with Belarussians and Ukrainians 20 years earliers) was divided by two ruthless states and only recently thrown off its shackles and became free again, which conveniently still has the exact borders Stalin decided upon.

Well, yes. But a Zwischenlager is not made to contain the waste for tens of thousands of years. It needs to be continously monitored, the rusting barrels (we already had quite a few of these) need to be put into larger barrels, and so on. 

It's a form of debt: Let the following generations pay for the benefits we have right now. An attitude I dispise deeply, I like to clean up my own mess, and not leave it to others. It's irresponsible. And the fact that this is how the waste handled right now makes me angry. Hence ""it's already stored in Zwischenlagern"" is really a sarcastic comment on the state of affairs.

&gt; We don't know yet if we have to store the waste for hundreds of years. 

For the current waste we have it certainly do. Much longer than hundreds of years. As I said, I think the official requirement is a million years. Even if that is too high, tens of thousands certainly.

&gt; There are better concepts for disposal that can become economically viable in the meantime. 

Maybe they are, maybe they are not. It's a gamble. And questions like this should have been solved before producing the waste in the first place. Again, irresponsible. You don't gamble with the health of other people.

Il discorso che fai possiamo applicarlo a diverse cose,  purtroppo però non possiamo comprendere fino in fondo ogni cosa che usiamo quindi sulle cose molto complesse un po' le persone si adagiano,  vedi PC o vedi automobile.

&gt; {{nota disambigua|descrizione=altri significati|titolo=[[Acab (disambigua)]]}}

&gt; '''A.C.A.B.''', acronimo di '''All Cops Are Bastards''' (in italiano: ''tutti i poliziotti sono bastardi''), è un'espressione diffusasi nel Regno Unito negli anni settanta, mentre l'intero testo esisteva nel parlato dagli anni venti, anche nella forma ""All coppers are bastards""&lt;ref name=""guerra""
&gt;[http://www.academia.edu/4566221/Dalla_strada_alla_letteratura_le_spericolate_e_propizie_vicende_del_forestierismo_A.C.A.B.._Il_contatto_linguistico_tra_italiano_e_inglese_nelle_sottoculture_Skinhead_e_Ultras, ''Dalla strada alla letteratura, le spericolate e propizie vicende del forestierismo A.C.A.B.. Il contatto linguistico tra italiano e inglese nelle sottoculture Skinhead e Ultras'', Analele Universităţii din Craiova, Seria Ştiinţe Filologice Linguistică Nr. 1-2, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;. L'acronimo è divenuto di uso popolare negli [[anni 1980|anni ottanta]], quando diede il titolo a un brano del gruppo [[Inghilterra|inglese]] [[The 4-Skins]]. I 4-Skins erano una band composta da [[skinhead]]s che si erano conosciuti nell'ambiente delle tifoserie calcistiche&lt;ref name=""guerra"" /&gt; e la popolarità della canzone all'interno di tale movimento fece in modo che l'acronimo fosse adottato come [[slogan]] dall'intera cultura skinhead, (indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico). Lo skinhead nacque nella Gran Bretagna degli [[anni 1960|anni sessanta]], e già dal principio questa cultura si integrò e caratterizzò la schiera degli [[hooligan]] inglesi. Il movimento fin dal principio manifestò un'antipatia piuttosto diffusa verso i poliziotti e le forze dell'ordine, con cui nascevano spesso dei contrasti, in particolare allo stadio. Come si può notare, una parte degli stessi hooligan, o degli [[ultras]] in genere, è composta da skinhead tutt'oggi, come continuano tutt'oggi le rivalità tra tifosi e forze dell'ordine. Negli anni ottanta, il movimento skinhead si espanse anche in [[Europa]] e negli [[Stati Uniti d'America|Stati Uniti]], portando con sé, di conseguenza, le usanze e i detti tipici. Tra questi figurerà appunto anche il famoso detto A.C.A.B., che successivamente si estese anche al resto degli ultras e dei tifosi delle squadre di calcio.&lt;br /&gt;
I primi membri italiani della comunità Skinhead hanno ricostruito in alcune testimonianze come il gruppo [[The 4-Skins]] fosse ascoltato in Italia e alcuni Skinhead italiani si fossero recati in Inghilterra per assistere ai loro concerti, non sembra essere dunque servito il trascorrere di molto tempo affinché l’acronimo divenisse noto ed adoperato, seppur in un gruppo ristretto di persone, anche in Italia&lt;ref name=""guerra"" /&gt;.
Oggi il detto è usato, oltre che in ambiente carcerario dove l'acronimo è stato repertato per la prima volta nel 1977, da alcuni ultras, tifosi, nonché dai gruppi politici antiautoritari e da gruppi politici neofascisti, e non solo da skinhead&lt;ref name=""guerra"" /&gt;.

The Nazis improvised a lot, and their policies changed based on the current weather. Let's not forget that Hitler attempted to draw Poland into the anti-comintern pact some years before the war, and he was more than willing to stage a funeral when Poland's then-leader Pilsudzki (sorry for the spelling) died. 

Don't get me wrong,  Hitler was certainly not a nice guy,and the future of Poland as a state was very dark, however the total extermination of all the PEOPLE was extremely unlikely. Having said that, once Hitler had germanised all those he thought were 'fit' or as he believed were 'originally German' (a convenient lie to fit his policies) the remain would be utilised as slave labour, with many killed - a terrible fate no doubt. 

As for the soviets, you made some good points but look at Katyn and tell me the soviets were simply surpressing those 30,000 evil men, whereas Hitler simply killed for fun because he had a beef with the Poles...

I'm not saying Nazis=Soviets,but both were inherently evil, and don't say that Stailn gave Poland those lands as a goodwill gesture of his eternal love, it was their goal to subordinate half of Europe let's not forget and push as far west as possible. He simply created a puppet state which was easier to manage.

The hatred of the Reds in Poland is quite understandable though, they walked through the country committing horrific atrocities and had the audacity to call it liberation. I think the recent hate is not due to it being 'cool' or hip, but rather recent events which were unsettling (see Ukraine).

The extent to which stirrups may or may not have been critical in later developments is an ongoing debate, of which I know too little to argue over.


I'm not denying it.


My comment was on stirrups only:

A common claim is that stirrups provide an advantage in term of balance or handling of lance. However, testings comprising the use of  roman saddle did not show any such advantage. (Those were done by Peter Connoly and ANne Hyland, and they were the most rigorous testings I know of).

The advantages provided by stirrups are faster mounting and dismounting, and comfort once you are mounted. 

Another element is that we now know there *were* effective cavalry tactics and formations before the stirrup. This is why I don't think the reorganization of carolingian armies can really be linked to stirrups. Especially since stirrups were already invented, way before the Caroligian Empire was a thing.

The more outlandish claims that stirrups ""gave birth to feudalism"" are already obsolete, since we know that there was no such thing as feudalism.",0,1416991499,null,0,false,0,cmdfpg8,t3_2ndu2p,t1_cmdfpg8,t1_cmdfmy0,null,1425834419,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

So if you say *Ich spiele gerne Gitarre*, you literally say something like ""I play the guitar with pleasure"". That's why it works as a standalone answer too: *Kommst du mit? - Gerne!* (""Do you want to join me/us?"" - ""With pleasure!"").  

*Ich gerne Orangensaft* would translate to ""I with pleasure orange juice"". That doesn't work neither in English nor German. There's a verb missing.  

&gt; But what if I have two verbs related to the modal verb? Like, if I want to say ""I must read and finish my homework"" or ""He is allowed to play in the playground and to ride his bicycle"". How should I write that?  

It's pretty much the same in German and in English. The sentence ""I must read and finish my homework"" is a contraction of ""I must read and I must finish my homework"". This full sentence would translate to ""Ich muss lesen und ich muss meine Hausaufgaben zu Ende machen"". And in both languages, you can just leave out the repeated ""I must"" / ""ich muss"": ""Ich muss lesen und meine Hausaufgaben zu Ende machen"".  

The same goes for ""He is allowed to play in the playground and to ride his bicycle"" = ""He is allowed to play in the playground and ~~he is allowed~~ to ride his bicycle"" --&gt; *Er darf auf dem Spielplatz spielen und ~~er darf~~ Fahrrad fahren* = *Er darf auf dem Spielplatz spielen und Fahrrad fahren*.

I'm not sure if this is what your teacher wants to hear though because you use a modal verb only for the first action (*Ich möchte Computer spielen*). So maybe something like *Ich möchte Computer spielen und muss drei Prüfungen schreiben, aber ich hoffe, dass ich meine Freunde in den Winterferien sehen kann*. This way, you use *möchten*, *müssen* and *können*. The last part is inverted because it is a subordinate clause.

No. Adams position is always that due to being the leader of Sinn Fein, the IRA leadership answer him honestly when he asks them questions. He does not admit being an IRA leader himself, although both the Irish and British governments believe he is the IRAs commander in Chief. So he's acknowledging that the allegations are true because he's being *told*, not that he himself is in a position to know this, even if the latter may be true, he can never admit being in the IRA as he is now the leader of one of Irelands largest parties and his imprisonment would cause chaos. He still however, takes personal responsibility of negative actions of the IRA as a ""republican leader"".

Either way the blog post was refreshingly honest and open about what happened, and how they failed in this regards. He denies specific allegations that he covered up anything, but admits that abuses did happen and as an organization they where completely naive in how to handle it. The IRA in many areas where expected to act like the police, which they did, but their type of swift ""lets just shoot them or expel them"" type of justice wasn't appropriate for sexual assault as it didn't really help the victim.

&gt;The reality of course is that a professional, accountable and impartial policing service was absent and unattainable in a society that was manifestly unjust. In many republican areas the community put pressure on the IRA - which sprang from and was sustained by the community - to fill this policing vacuum. 

&gt;The IRA itself often viewed this role as a major distraction from its central function. It suspected that the RUC indulged criminals in order to tie down IRA resources and demoralise the nationalist community.

&gt;IRA 'policing' was most evident in those areas where it had strongest support. The bulk of this activity involved mediation between those in dispute, and went unreported.

&gt;However, the IRA often punished petty criminals, car thieves, burglars and drug dealers. The IRA, inevitably also made mistakes.

&gt;Despite the high standards and decency of the vast majority of IRA volunteers, IRA personnel were singularly ill-equipped to deal with these matters. This included very sensitive areas such as responding to demands to take action against rapists and child abusers. The IRA on occasion shot alleged sex offenders or expelled them.

 
&gt;While this may have been expedient at the time it was not appropriate. **Victims were left without the necessary social service support and abusers without supervision. It ultimately failed victims and the community alike. That is a matter of profound regret for me, and many other republicans**.

For example, in the US, being a black man or woman was only decriminalized in 1993, though there are currently no laws in the US prohibiting discrimination on the basis of being African American, and households headed by African Americans are ineligible for the legal protections available to whites. Being black was also declassified as a mental illness in the US only in 1999.

Black people are not allowed the freedom of assembly, and only rarely are they allowed to gather in groups or to engage in parades. Freedom of speech is available only to whites.

Recent polls in the US have indicated that a majority of white Americans support laws discriminating against black people, and in June of 2013 the US government enacted a national ""African American propaganda"" law, which purportedly was to prevent distribution of ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships"" among blacks and whites. The great European state of the Flemish and Human rights observers reported a surge in anti-black rhetoric, violence, and hate crimes, many of which using the law as justification. A number of African American rights protesters in the US have also been arrested under the law.

Britain's Channel 4 produced a documentary, *Goin' Huntin' Ma!"", about the life for black people in the US under the new law, showing how it legitimized vigilante groups who hunt and abuse African Americans, especially poor black people, in ""a wave of terror"". Since the law was enacted, poor American black people seeking asylum in Belgium has spiked fourfold. In addition to activists, leaders of foreign governments, and 27 Nobel prize winners from the fields of science and the arts who have condemned the law, perhaps the most prescient and important voice of opposition has come from frequent user of the reddit.com website, /u/JebusGobson, who frequently posts a few sentences on the issue.

That's ""innocent"" 18-year-old Michael Brown robbing a store clerk just before officer Darren Wilson tried to apprehend him:

&gt; “When I start looking at Brown, first thing I notice is in his right hand, his hand is full of cigarillos. And that’s when it clicked for me because I now saw the cigarillos, I looked in my mirror, I did a doublecheck that Johnson was wearing a black shirt, these are the two from the stealing,” Wilson testified.

&gt; He reversed his car in a bid to cut off the pair’s path. At that point, Wilson and Brown engaged in the fatal altercation that led to endless debate and prompted months of protests against Ferguson Police. Johnson testified Wilson initiated physical contact, that he never saw Brown throw a punch and that Brown was outside the police cruiser when Wilson shot him.

&gt; Wilson testified he acted in self-defense after Brown punched him and attempted to grab his gun. During the struggle for the gun, he said, Brown “had the most intense aggressive face. The only way I can describe it, it looks like a demon, that’s how angry he looked.”

**Edit:**

I think there are many things that can be done about the situation in the US, where more than 100 people are killed during incidents with police every year. No question. However, this issue is in many ways used not on its own merits, but is blown out of proportion as a way to solidify previosuly held beliefs for their own sake - in a way that disgraces the families involved. 

For example, in Brazil, an average of eight people are killed by the police every day, having killed roughly 12,000 Brazilians over the last five years. But people aren't talking about that, are they? Why not? 

And I don't mean to cheapen the argument, but in the US, around 450 people are killed every year by falling out of bed, and in Russia, dozens of people are killed every year by icicles ([source](http://www.oddee.com/item_98002.aspx)). Texting while driving kills roughly 6,000 people in the US every year.

(Che poi ci devo credere che un pezzo di carta della parrocchia di Canicatti abbia un qualche effetto su quello che fa l'equivalente dell'Agenzia delle Entrate tedesca, ma qui potrei sbagliami.)

In Italia il numero di battezzati e di sbattezzati non ha alcun effetto sui soldi che arrivano alla Chiesa.

Est ce que les planches sont trop crues pour être exposées en extérieure dans un square publique, je ne suis pas toulousain mais il faudrait voir quel est le genre de publique qui peut-être le plus exposé. Est ce que parler de sodomie c'est faire de la banalisation d'un acte dont la fréquence s'est décuplée au travers d'une exposition plus fréquente des jeunes générations à la pornographie? Est ce que c'est quelque chose que l'on doit cacher, ou taire?  

Qu'est ce qui choque dans les pages illustrant un viol, le texte? le caractère graphique, la suggestion d'être assimilé au violeur puisque tous les hommes semblent représenté en crocodile? J'ai du mal à voir le mal qu'il y a garder à l'esprit que le sexisme ordinaire est là où ne l'imagine pas toujours, au travers d'actes qui ne semblent pas tout le temps comme sexiste mais qui, à la personne qui en est victime, le sont pourtant bien. Évidemment, se montrer si pressant que dans l'histoire du viol parait sans ambiguïté et pourtant le fait que ça puisse arriver montre que certaines personnes n'en sont pas toujours conscientes.   

Moi je ne vois pas très bien ce qui justifiait de censurer les expositions, les planches peuvent mettre mal à l'aise mais c'est justement le sentiment que l'on devrait avoir envers les actes sexistes pour empêcher qu'ils arrivent au quotidien et ce n'est pas en les niant qu'on les fait disparaître.

Even compared to the most radical criticism of feudalism I've read so far. I don't have any expertise on the topic, but is there something ressembling a consensus on that?

The term ""feudalism"" is currently falling out of use because the word itself defines a very sweeping norm that never existed. Of course, medieval society was based on the relationship around land, but our understanding of ""feudalism"" as a strict, law-like norm regulated by specific contracts, that applied so widely to Europe has several problems.

First, the scales we're talking about are huge geographically and chronologically. The relationships that existed in France under the Carolingians in the 9th Century will be very different from the later Ottonians, or from the geographically distant Sicilians.

The word ""feudalism"" assumes too much of a stereotypical concpetion of suzerainty and the vassal condition for example. For much of the middle ages, Vassalage didn't exists as a highly formalized relationship. A count could a vassal of several kings, or to another count. Vassalage can mean anything without context. It could mean a non-agression understanding, it could mean only a friendship. The only recurring thing we know of vassalage is transfer of land; because that's the only thing mentionned in most records kept by the clergy at the time.

Here Roman Catholic church has a really strong impact in people's mentality and politics, even if in the latter it clearly shouldn't.

The Vatican still plays unofficially a major role in politics, strongly influencing the decision-making. This is one of the reason why in Italy there's still no legal recognition for gay couples.
Also, all properties of the Church in Italy benefit of some financial favours, like some tax exemptions.

But as I said, religion is still quite strong in people's mentality: medics can, for exemple, refuse to make a woman abort, in order to protect their values. Apparently, almost half of medics decide not to do it so that several italian women go abroad to have an abortion.

Nevertheless, I'd say that the younger generations are becoming the less and less attracted to religion, so that today Italy is ""importing"" priests from abroad, especially from Poland and Sub-Saharian Africa.

Religion is taught at school at any level, but you can opt-out and do another kind of activity.

The big majority of parents still send their children to church school, at least until they're 12.

You can't display ostensible religious imagery in public buildings, be they public schools, state administration buildings and whatnot. There are no religion classes. You can learn about religions in history classes, or in private religious schools.

Politicians would be highly criticized if they used their religious beliefs as arguments. I remember President Sarkozy made the cross sign when he visited the Vatican, and it became a scandal in France. Religious issues are naturally talked about, when relevant to socio-politics, but it's not the politician's place to comment on faith and whatnot.

There are no tax breaks for religions (exception in Alsace Lorraine), though historic monuments which may be religious in nature and still used religiously (like the Notre Dame Cathedral) are often owned by the state and thus have a special status. 

With growing Muslim communities who don't have old Mosques to fall back on like Christians do with century old churches, sometimes towns offer (at a very small symbolic price) Muslim communities land to build a Mosque on. This causes scandals and if brought to court, the court has sometimes considered this unlawful, as it's a way for the state to help religious practice, which is illegal.

~~However we have two not one state churches. The Roman Catholic and the Reformed/Protestant church.~~We have a number of ""state"" churches which are different in every canton: Roman Catholic, Reformed, Christ Catholic, in some even Jewish communities. They are however not real State churches as they have their own administrative and judicial structure. You have to pay a tax to them, which they use to fund their administration and services, with the services taking up most of the funding.

The religious classes however are not in school but organised by the church and fully optional. 

The only class on religion I had was in 'high school' (Gymnasium), but that was only in name as the class itself did not have anything to do with religion. This however depends entirely on the teacher, as I know others who had a complete introduction into the five world religions in the same class.

Outside of this religion is a very private thing. Everyone has his or her believe and everyone should leave it alone. This is the reason that there is a big political debate around hijabs and other religious symbols (including crosses at public schools). 

It is also a topic that you do not bring up in small talk and really only talk about with people you are very close to. 

Generally it can be said that membership in the state churches is declining, while membership in Free Churches (e.g. Evangelicals) is rising. Minority religions like Islam, Hinduism, Sikh, Jainism Buddhism, Shinto, Confucianism are mostly stagnant or growing slowly. Anti-Islam rhetoric is however rather common among right-wing populists sadly, completely ignoring our own traditions of keeping religion a private thing.

You should be very careful in stating personal opinions publicly if you're holding an official position, especially regarding such high-visibility events. The reason is that people are in general very bad at making a distinction between the private and the public person. If France screws up anything related to racial/cultural/religious relations with her as the Justice Minister, these comments will come back to haunt her.

Edit1: It gets even better if you think about what this seemingly tells us about Mme Taubira's stance on the rule of law.

&gt;""I am not making a value judgement on United States institutions (but) when the feeling of frustration is so strong, so deep, so lasting and massive, you have to ask yourself about the trust in these institutions"" said the minister.

So she does not make a value judgement regarding US institutions. Fine. But what she did is vent her personal feelings - as the Justice minister of France, no less - about a case within the US justice system. A case that has been followed up by the authorities as required within the context of US legislation. And yet the Justice minister of France seems the need to vent her dissatisfaction with that legal process because it didn't get her the outcome she apparently wanted. Alas, this has nothing to do with the US in particular, by her own words. So it must be something more general. What is that, then? That a legal system is fine unless it doesn't get the results you, as a Justice minister, want?

What an unorthodox and refreshing view!

Edit2: Mind you, there might very well be something amiss within the US justice system. Even a systemic bias against certain parts of the population. The problem is though that this isn't unique to the US, and pointing fingers and public shaming is most likely not the way forward. Especially if your own country isn't exactly the model for violent-free integration of all parts of society. In any case, you can express public support without being so blatantly damaging to your own and your country's image.

Problème : J'avais pas vu les épisodes précédent.

Et c'est là que je suis tombé de haut, je suis désolé pour ceux qui apprécient les films. Mais j'ai trouver ça chiant à crever, limite énervant.

J'ai trouvé l'univers incohérent et j'avais aucune envie de m'immerger dedans.

Les personnages sont pas attachants, mis à part la protagoniste principale j'ai eu l'impression que les autres ont été rajouté parce qu'il faut des gentils et des méchants pour faire bien dans le scénario. 

J'aime pas Jennifer Lawrence, ses gammes d'expressions faciales sont limitées et elle surjoue beaucoup. Je comprends pas le buzz qui s'est fait autour d'elle. Mis à part faire jolie sur les affiches de blockbuster j'ai du mal à voir quelle autre contribution elle peut faire au septième art. J'espère qu'elle pourra me surprendre dans les prochaines années, on arrive pas à ce niveau par simple hasard (quoi que...). Je pensais pareil pour Matthew Mc Connaughey : juste bon pour les comédies romantiques. Mais depuis True Detective et Interstellar mon opinion sur le bonhomme est plus que positive.

Le film se veut avec de l'action et des rebondissements. De l'action, y en a pas des masses et pour les quelques scènettes c'est tellement mal filmé qu'on comprend pas ce qui se passe. Le passage où tout le monde se rue sur la corne d'abondance : j'ai.rien.compris. Qui est mort ? Qui est vivant ? Qui a fait quoi ? Mystère.
Les rebondissements, inexistants aussi. Le scénario est cousu de fil blanc, du début à la fin y a pas beaucoup de surprise.

En bref, j'ai pas aimé, j'ai pas envie de voir la suite et j'ai surtout pas envie d'aller voir les nouveaux opus au cinéma.

false,Parabellum8g,NETH,Indifference is the best kind of tolerance (/s),"Dutch here: in practice we have total separation between religion and state, as there are no links between religion and state practice in our constitution (save the one concerning religious schools, but I'll get back at that). I will add to this that some religious organisations receive government funding, but this has more to do with a cultural context. The government is forced to treat all equal, so religion does not have much of a say over here.

Religious parties play a minor, mediocre role in Dutch politics and the little influence they have can almost never lead to discriminatory legislation. There is still an exception left regarding schools on a religious basis: the government provides for the schools their budgets, while the same schools are allowed to refuse gay teachers for example.

Religious symbols are allowed in schools and other public institutions, unless some rare exception regarding safety or communication difficulties would apply.

Apparantly the average Dutchman is secular in nature, with only about 10 to 15 percent of the population regularly participating in religious services. Still, atheists remain a minority over here as many Dutch apparantly believe in 'something'. In short they want to have it all without all the drawbacks, so many people here create their own little religion when it comes down to 'faith'.

Around 78% of the Danish population are members, and that number is dropping.

Further, the Danish monarch is considered head of the People's Church. All members of the Danish royal family must be members of the church and as such must be protestants. They still have freedom of religion, just like anyone else in Denmark, but they can't be monarchs unless they accept the protestant faith. In practice they Church is run by the Minister of Ecclesiastical affairs (Kirkeministeren), but he can practice whichever faith he likes.

We also have religious education in school (kristendomskundskab). However, its purpose is to teach children *about* religion, namely Christianity, not to make sure that children are brought up the Christian faith. You can also be excempt from religious education by your parents'/guardians' request.

The school does leave an additional timeslot in the schedule specifically for religious education by a priest. This is because people who are babtised in the People's Church must confirm their faith by the age of 14 in order to join the church, and until then they must learn about their faith and prepare for the confirmation ceremony. I wasn't babtised and never went to these extracurricular classes, so I can't tell you exactly what's going on, but I can tell you that many kids just do the ceremony because they will be showered with expensive gifts in the following ""confirmation party,"" not because they particularly care about Christianity.

Religion doesn't influence political decision making, ~~and most people are either atheist/agnostic or into some weird, new-age spiritualism, so even though Denmark has an official state religion, it is for all intents and purposes a secular society.~~

As for other buyers, I don't think that's even been discussed yet anywhere. Part of the problem is that the two ships are unlike other Mistral ships that France uses. These have been adapted to Russia's needs, from somewhat superficial things like Russian-language controls and computer interfaces, to more significant changes such as different size of the interior docks to accommodate Russian helicopters. Then of course the communication systems are different (even though Russia would be getting some NATO radars and comms, which is very important to them).

Senza certezze i consumi non ripartono (vedi il mancato effetto degli 80€) e senza consumi l'economia recede. Ma appunto non sono un economista, non ne capisco abbastanza. Sono solo miei banali e basilari ragionamenti, quasi da bar sotto casa.
Però continuando a ragionare faccio fatica a vedere questa strada come ""la soluzione"", dato che buona parte dei problemi dell'Italia risiedono altrove:
- corruzione (quanto ci costa?);
- sprechi;
- istruzione (sforniamo frotte di ""ingegneri"" che oltre a non saper scrivere due righe in italiano corretto, fanno fatica anche persino ad afferrare il concetto di ""ordine di grandezza""... per carità, sforniamo anche bravi ingegneri, dottori, avvocati e tanto altro, ma nell'insieme, quelli bravi sono davvero pochi);
- giustizia (quanto dura una causa e che certezza ho di venir riconosciute le mie ragioni?);
- e si, lavoro.
Ma per quanto riguarda il lavoro io vedo più il problema dell'eccessivo ricorso a forme di contratto atipiche per aggirare norme a tutela del lavoratore (ti rinnovo il contratto di 6 mesi in 6 mesi, così so che non mi resti incinta... per dire, quando non ti mettono direttamente davanti la lettera di dimissioni in bianco e non esci finché non firmi) e perché, stranamente i contratti atipici, al datore di lavoro, costano meno che quelli a tempo indeterminato. A questo ci aggiungo il nanismo volontario (sempre grazie all'attuale normativa che non incentiva altrimenti) della piccola e media impresa italiana: come vuoi pensare di essere competitivo nel mercato globale se non hai le spalle abbastanza larghe e non vuoi nemmeno averle?

While the country lacks hospitals, kindergartens, schools, the number of churches is overflowing and they keep building them with each passing day.

This way the church is currently making a very high profit in the end using the people's money to manipulate them into disregarding what Romania's population should focus on.
Another aspect of the church in Romania is their almost full power over the country, being able to directly involve into matter of politics and shamelessly manipulate the elders to take sides as the preachers tell them to. These people being manipulated are mostly from the country side and they are not well informed so they will believe almost everything that the church tells them.

Apart from that there's not a huge amount to do, so just spend your time wandering about enjoying the sites.  

quick fact: Ridley Scott used Avila as Jerusalem for his film Kingdom of Heaven.  Can't tell tho thanks to all the CGI work.

Salamanca:

Big things to do here are the main square, spotting the astronaut on the cathedral and also the art deco museum is worth a look.

But the single best thing to do in Salamanca is the Tapas pub crawl.  Basically you hop from one pub to another having a drink and a selection of tapas.  This means you enjoy delicious food, decent beer/wine and don't get too hammered too quick.

Toledo:  Old, old city.  You'll spend most of it simply visiting various ""relics"", which may start to work out expensively.  You'll also probably be very tempted to buy a sword as that's the touristy thing to do.  Not sure how US customs would look at that going home tho.

Segovia:  One fairytale castle and then one still surviving Roman aqueduct.  Those are the biggies.  If you can splurge go to the ""Meson de Candido"" for Spains finest cochinillo.

Ma stai cercando anche di dire che i peggio governi al mondo, oligarchie da manicomio civile, siano in alcun modo giustificabili in virtù di un relativismo morale di cui francamente nessuno sente la necessaria presenza?

Da quel che ho capito, e davvero non riesco a capire come un simile ragionamento stia in piedi, stai dicendo che la cattiva condotta di qualche paese democratico sia erroneamente giustificata dalle persone comuni dal fatto che quei paesi sono democratici rispetto agli altri (immagino che il punto fondamentale siano gli avvenimenti in Ucraina). E davvero, non è vero. Se ""tifo"" USA e UE non è perchè sono democratici ma perchè dalla loro proseprità (ritengo che) derivi la mia prosperità.

First of all the country is divided almost equally between nominal protestants and nominal catholics. Something that is rather unique in Europe (Germany being the only country that has the same division). In the end secularization has taken a faster grip on protestants so practically you will find more catholics actually attending church. 

Nonetheless, our country is very much based on christian principles and for a very long time (WWII to the 90's) the Christian Democrats (in one guise or another but mostly as the CDA) were the ruling party of our country in a coalition with either labour or the liberals. 

So yes, there is a division of church and state, but religion has always played a large role in our politics, through political parties. I think the traditional division between catholics, protestants, socialists and liberals (who in the past had completely seperate institutions and lives) has played a crucial role in the development of Dutch politics, which is very much based on cooperation and the compromise. 

So yes, in practice we have a system based on total separation of Church and State (although the head of State is always a Protestant so there's that minor detail) the effects of religion on what that state is and how it has developed have been major.

* Public money would leverage additional capital. (Every euro would generate 15€ of additional investment)

*  Money will come on top of the €630 billion that are already there.

* His plan is to give money to new projects around the EU. He wants to invest into education, new data centers, modernize infrastructure, new hospital equipment, renewable energy sources etc (all nice things)

The only problem is, he doesn't have the money (yet)

*Money will not fall from the sky. We do not have a money printing machine. We will have to attract money and make it work for us.* 

He wants to get the money from

European Fund for Strategic Investments: Public money from the EU budget and the European Investment Bank. EIB would give out loans of €63 billion to finance riskier parts of the projects (316bn in 3 years)

Member states will probably needs to step up and contribute to this. (this will not end well in many smaller countries)


He doesnt want politicans to allocate the projects, no political fiddling with projects, no national wish-lists. He wants to create technical assistance programme and assign technicians who have the experience and know-how to do so. Experts will validate every single project and decide if its worth financing. There will be regularly report for the politicians on the activities of the Fund.

That only works if you assume that company is one hundred percent rational in the way they hire people - which is how things should *ideally* work, but it's rarely the case in reality. There are strong cultural and gender biases at every level of the hiring process. 

Actions like these are not designed to force companies to hire women just because they are women. They are designed to stop companies from hiring men just because they are men. It's supposed to *cancel out* a bias that already exists (for as long as it exists), not to introduce a new, arbitrary one. 

Granted, it isn't an ideal solution, but it is the most practical and easily observable one. That doesn't mean that different steps shouldn't be taken alongside affirmative action to improve gender equality on a more fundamental basis.

And if you are in a dictatorship erverything you do or say against the dictators is illegal, so who cares about laws in such a situation. The solution in a democacy is not to vote for fuckheads who possibly want to install a dictatorship, man everybody could have known this in germany through reading his dumb ""Mein Kampf"".

But i do not say that everything we do here would function in the US. There are historic, social, geographical, ..... differences that may be a reason for it not functioning there.

1. The US has a history of private weapon ownership that europe has not. Also it was nescessary for private people to own a weapon to protect oneself in huge areas with the next police station far away, with dangerous animals .... Maybe it is even today necessary at least in some areas. Also there are a lot of weapons in the society, so it is not easy 

2. Social security is in germany high and our society is willing to pay for it. So maybe that can be a reason for less violent crimes regarding property. 

A burglar with a weapon is really seldom here, he do not need a weapon cause there is less risk for his live, and if he gets caught with or without a weapon while burgling etc. makes a big difference in the sentence.  Also a lot of us  will not go with great violence after a burgler or even shot him with a weapon to get our property back, maybe cause of our mentality to have an insurance for nearly everything. 

I think it will be hard for an american that has grown up in an totally other system, to accept or acknowledge that this can function even in a capitalist country, cause germany is a capitalist country just with a system of high social security for which the citizens are willing to pay.  The same for weapons, it is for americans that have grown up with weapons all around them, somehow totally normal and they think it can just function this way, while in germany nearly no one has grown up with weapons around them and if somebody walks with a weapon around in public it is a big deal. All the things i write here is the result of reading stuff on the internet, from some americans that think only their system can function and that everything else is crap and not against you or someone personally. Just against statements I read very often on the internet.

People like the Op who want to visit us or even live together with us in our country have to know, that our society is like that.  If he does not accept that, he or she has to stay in his own country. If we as a society would want to have a laxer weapon law or less social security and therefor pay less in the system, we would form a party and vote for it.

abbiamo fatto il matrimonio in chiesa ma con rito ""misto"", abbiamo dovuto richiedere una dispensa per lei dal vescovo (in pratica un benestare)

se tu approfitti del fatto che al tempo avevi fatto la cresima annulli il sacramento per tua moglie, so che per te non vuol dire niente ma per un credente è comunque una cosa importante e se ci tieni alla persona che sposi mi pare giusto tutelarla (anche se fare il corso prematrimoniale coi preti è una palla :P)

I call serious bullshit on this one. The reverse is taking [place](http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/themas/vrije-tijd-cultuur/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2013/2013-3929-wm.htm), with the catholic church being only in lead in total number of followers. People that actually practice the Catholic faith however are among the smallest groups out there.

The history lesson aside: nowadays there is no religious influence left, save some deals made with the CU and SGP to postpone certain legislation which they don't like. The CDA is christian in name only and the 'Christian' part in its name has all but vanished in practice. It might as well rename itself to the DA as that would do more right to reality, including to its non-Christian members (which there are many).

I'm going to venture to assert that French shipwrights are better skilled than their Russian counterparts. Have you read about the nightmare India went through in purchasing a Russian Carrier? Nothing worked, cost tripled, duration tripled, and the Carrier sat hostage for increased funds. My point is that sure they have the technology but that doesn't matter if they can't utilize it effectively.

That is just the theory. 

If anything, this is just another example of why the concept of free market and competition doesn't work in practice the way it was imagined to work in theory.

In reality, businesses are *extremely* flawed in *many* different ways. Gender equality is one of those things that's not usually a primary concern, because there's usually a lot of **other** things going wrong inside a company at the same time that need fixing. 

&gt; That is why we should opt for having the same rules for players on the market (job market included), not creating a weird situation of ""positive discrimination"".

&gt; In the context of the CAHROM meeting on trafficking in Roma communities and its links to child marriage, the
&gt; European Roma and Traveller’s Forum and the Informal Platform of Romani Women “Phenjalipe” have prepared
&gt; a paper which aims to caution against the danger of further stereotyping and victimising Roma communities by
&gt; labeling early or child marriage in Roma communities as a cultural specificity. This paper aims to raise awareness
&gt; on the topic and demonstrate that child and early marriages must be addressed in a comprehensive manner, taking
&gt; into account the specific situations that exist as well as the historic and socio-economic factors contributing to
&gt; this practice and its perpetuation. In addition, this paper seeks to deconstruct the view that state authorities bear
&gt; no responsibility for early and child marriage, which is a widespread stance sustained by their labeling as ‘internal
&gt; Roma cultural practices’.

I grew up as a practicing catholic, most of my peers were not. There are definetely super-religious people around (my mother -who would vote to ban all contraception if she could - for one) but they're an ever decreasing minority. What you have to remember about Ireland is that the proportion of the population under 40 is pretty large compared to the rest of Europe. 

The standing of the church has been destroyed since the sex abuse scandals, you're more likely to hear negative things about the church than positive, sure, tons of people still support the church, but they tend to stay quiet about it. I guess you could say the population is probably more polarised than other countries, but there's no real culture war because the pro-church side have kinda been shamed into silence.

Sure, abortion is illegal, but I don't think that's the church hierarchy's influence specifically causing that, more people's own ideas. Numerous polls have found a clear majority in favour of gay marriage.

The church still has a non-negligible influence in schools though (as most are on land owned by the church), particularly primary schools where baptized children get preferential entry leading to sham baptisms and parents wanting the tradition of communion/confirmation etc. In secondary school it's not so bad, you have religion 3 classes a week (as per the terms of agreement between the church/government) but it's pretty open ended as to how those classes can be used.

Most things are separated between church and state but some are closely interwoven. 

- There is a church tax that everyone with an income has to pay unless he leaves the Church

- Priests and alike are getting paid by the state, not the church (!) and apparently abuse by those does not need to be judged outside of church (not sure about that one)

- State still gives money to the church because of [german mediatization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_mediatization) from the early 19th century

- Biggest social employers and charities are christian

- Crucifixes and alike are not allowed in state-owned buildings. In practice, they will hang there unless someone sues someone and the court judges in their favor (which is not sure)

- Positive and negative religious freedom makes sure there is basically a constant debate. The thing with christian crucifixes, muslimic headscarfes and jewish/muslimic circumcisions are still debated every now and then here because of this. Another point of debate is whether employers like the church are allowed to dismiss non-heterosexuals, amateur porn stars or alike 

- In private life, nobody really cares about religion. That's private. Most people who are ""eagerly"" religious are rather seen as oddballs.

- In politics, the christian party (CDU) is the biggest german party but there is basically nothing ""christian"" about them except if you count being conservative and intolerant against non-heterosexuals and immigrants (in x-th generation) christian.

- Some schools/states write your confession onto the first site of your A-level

Der Meter war z.B. früher durch den Urmeter definiert; der musste dafür wie das Urkilogramm heute noch unter extrem gut kontrollierten Bedingungen aufbewahrt werden. Heute definiert man eine Sekunde über die Caesium-Frequenz und den Meter dann über die Lichtgeschwindigkeit. Beides sind nach bestem Wissen Natur-Konstanten, die Caesium-Frequenz wegen der Quantenmechanik, die Lichtgeschwindigkeit wegen der Relativitätstheorie. Dadurch wird man unabhängig von handgemachten ""Pseudo-Konstanten"" wie eben der Länge des Urmeters. Bei der Umdefinition des Meters wurde damals die Lichtgeschwindigkeit auf genau 299792458 m/s gerundet, wodurch sich die Länge eines Meters minimal verändert hat. Das macht die Definition einfacher, ist aber relativ gesehen hinreichend wenig, so dass direkte praktische Konsequenzen nicht auftreten sollten.

Das Problem beim Urkilogramm ist (bzw. war), soweit ich das verstehe, dass z.B. die naheliegenste Definition über die Avogadro-Konstante (""1 kg ist die Masse von so-und-sovielen Kohlenstoff-Atomen"") das Problem hat, dass man dafür in der Lage sein müsste, grob 10^23 Atome zählen zu können. Die damit verbundene Unsicherheit wäre schlimmer als die Probleme beim Urkilogramm.

But remember, especially in rural areas the peer pressure of not leaving the church it is quite high. Also, pretty much all national holidays are catholic/Christian ones, save the protestants also have an additional one (31st of October).

Additionally the Roman catholic church still has wide spread tax reductions:

* Property tax for buildings used for sermon are tax free (est. loss ~53 million).
* The ""fee"" you pay for being in the Church can be added to the tax returns (est. loss ~124 million).
* Teachers of religious classes are being paid by the government. This is mostly all right however since those teachers also teach other classes (religion + history is a popular combination). We also pay the the teachers of all private schools from the church however, which IMHO is wrong.
* We (Austria) still pay them roughly 44 million each year since 1960 for damages done by the Nazi regime. This contract is unlimited and should have run out - imho - a long time ago.
* The church owns roughly 2500 square kilometres of area (~ 1214 km2 forests, rest are acres), for which they receive EU money (as any farmer would). Estimations figure the income there as roughly 1,8 billion each year, but I think that is too high.
* There is a contract between the Church and the ORF where religious content has to be shown on television. This leads to a one-sided religious portrayal in the state official news and media. Of course not speaking about the minutes they use up for free, which are monetary losses for the ORF.

There was an estimation made a few years ago that the Roman Catholic Church of Austria receives roughly 2 billion of tax money each year in various forms.

Also church officials are still highly present on debates related to moral and ethics. Especially when it comes to topics they find ""sinful"" (like homosexuality).

* Radical church officials have spoken out against wedding of homosexuals (a compromise law was created instead).
* The church once released an official paper claiming that homosexuals should not work in certain areas (education and training/apprenticeship). After some initial uproar the document suggesting this (Amtsblatt der Österreichischen Bischofskonferenz Nr. 34) was revised and ""fixed"".
* The church is vehemently against the new law for freezing + keeping of ovules for medical reasons.

In recent years however the numbers of people leaving the church is high:

* 2008~2009 the sex scandal in St. Poelten caused many people to leave (~50 000) 
* 2010 the global sex scandal came up, roughly ~90 000 people left the church in protest
* The new pope Franziskus is popular however and reduced that number again down to roughly ~50 000 a year.

Few things I might add:

* offending a head of foreign state is punishable by up to 3 years in prison. Enforced only in regards to the Pope. 
* the church is the biggest real estate owner in the country. The story behind that is quite long and involves the infamous 'Estate Commission' but can be summed up as a bribe paid by one of the previous governments to the Church for toning down its critique.

Most Europeans probably don't trust the US *or* Russian government very much right now. It's already pretty bizarre to Europeans for the US to fingerprint all foreign visitors, but if I recall correctly this was a [post-9/11](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3367893.stm) ""anti-terrorism"" measure and it's introduction made some sense contextually at the time.

For Russia to start doing this now  is at least *of interest*, and implies something has changed for the Russian government - why now? The obvious answer is that both the international and internal attitude towards the Russian government has changed over the past year.

In my opinion, they are responding to a perceived drop in political support internationally with a measure you can only really introduce when you have strong political support internally. It serves two measures: protecting against real terrorist threats, and increasing the Russian public's *perception* of terrorist threats. 

Much like the US introduction of fingerprinting at the border (and pretty much all of the Patriot Act) this increases their power in both regards - the ability to identify and stop terrorism, and the ability to build fear among the population to maintain and build support of further police and state powers. 

When there's enough political support, most governments will take any opportunity to increase the scope of their power. The fact that other governments do it doesn't make it good or right, however. I'm strongly against my government (UK) doing the same, but I expect it will happen soon enough.

In Soviet times Catholic church was the only not fully state controlled organisation (fully penetrated by KGB, but not yet becoming a part of it) in whole country that survived throughout the Soviet rule, probably that is the reason why 77% of residents of Republic of Lithuania are self-proclaimed catholics, though only minority are religious, but it is rather than a spiritual, but a political statement of belonging, respect to tradition of freedom and conscience.

Obviously, but why would he make noise about it? Him saying something now is due to it currently being a public narrative. How the IRA handled policing isn't a secret. 

Nothing Maria Cahill has stated is anything new, other than there might be pedophiles in the republic that where expelled by the IRA, although both policing services have said there is zero evidence so far that has happened.

We all knew the IRA enforced face to face meetings with accused and accuser, we all knew the IRA shot and expelled people they found guilty. So at what point did you expect Adams to come out and say the IRA are crap policemen and appoligise for the way they handled sexual abuse, that wouldn't seem odd and out of the blue?

He's saying it now because its appropriate to say it now, because people **now** are making a fuss over it, even though we already knew this.  Just saying something randomly on his twitter inbetween pictures of his teddy bears and random jokes wouldn't be very appropriate.

Even if I am, dwelling on the issue isn't going to solve that. Neither is trying to outdo me.

&gt;Why would I not be concerned with how many are leaving and going, my eastern European friend?

Heh, with that choice of words the whole of Germany would be Eastern European.

&gt;At what point may I be permitted to concern myself with the net migration figure?

I didn't say that. I said that their motivations are of no concern to your assumptions about their future plans, since you can observe that most of the EU migrants eventually return home, leaving the UK wealthier than it was when they arrived, and ensuring that you needn't pay either their education or pension.

Also consider the following: [British authorities estimate that the population of UK citizens living in Spain is much larger than Spanish official figures suggest, establishing them at about 1,000,000, with 800,000 being permanent residents. According to the Financial Times, Spain is the most favoured destination for Western Europeans considering to move from their own country and seek jobs elsewhere in the EU.[4][5][6][7][8][9][10]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Europe#Historical_migration) Spain has twice as much immigrants of the UK alone, apparently migration is not the problem you make it out to be.

&gt;Not only are you arrogant you're also very short-sighted. It's not just about ""tax receipts to the treasury"". 

Hey, *you* limited the issue to the financial aspect.

&gt;It's also about quality of life. Most immigrants are settling in overcrowded English cities, not scotland or wales or the countryside.

I agree that London is sucking the life out of the rest of the country. The UK should revise its policy to facilitate more even development in the whole country, rather than betting everything on the performance of the City.

Consider this graph (http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/50116000/gif/_50116928_migration_uk_464.gif): even if migration would be a problem, clearly only a limited fraction is of EU origin, so you're not going to stop it by an EU exit.

I don't feel educated enough to comment on some of the anti-nuclear / GMO sentiments here because that is not limited to the Green party at all in Austria. I think NEOS genuinely chose the worst name they ever could have and shot themselves in the foot with that - a lot of the older bobo green-voting crowd in Austria are starting to earn actual money now and might be tempted, but the name sounds too similar to neo-liberalism and many have spent years demonstrating against that in their youth.

Whenever I do any of those political barometer test things, I find myself about the closest to Greens or smaller fringe party that have no chance, like Der Wandel. And there is no single politician I find particularly inspiring. Our chancellor, Faymann (centre left) is just... ugh. The ÖVP (centre right) are a complete mess.

&gt; **""What is significant is that across history, most of these incursions have been very small groups of airplanes, sometimes singletons or at most two aircraft,"" Breedlove, who is also the head of U.S. European Command, told a Pentagon briefing.**

&gt; **""What you saw this past week was a larger, more complex formation of aircraft carrying out a little deeper, and I would say a little bit more provocative flight path.""**

&gt; A Russian general has called for Russia to revamp its military doctrine, last updated in 2010, to clearly identify the U.S. and its NATO allies as Moscow's enemy number one and **spell out the conditions under which Russia would launch a preemptive nuclear strike against the 28-member military alliance**, Interfax reported Wednesday.

false,GustavGustavson,NETH,The Netherlands,"Well you are absolutely right in your assumption, basically secularization kicked in later with Catholics than it did with Protestants, as a result the Protestants that are still there tend to be more hard-line than many of the 'softer' Catholics who are still around. 

That Catholics are desecularizing faster now is a result of there being more secular-leaning Catholics around still nominally calling themselves religious. My future prediction was that in the future the two religions will stabilize at a similar level. 

I also read a statement somewhere that agrees with your second statement that people who are named as religiously active are actually not. I for instance was baptized into the Protestant church and am by default a member of that church. This also means that wherever I move in the Netherlands I get letters from my local branch of the church inviting me to stuff and asking for money. Being in this database I am counted as a Protestant, even though I consider myself atheist. 

What I would conclude from this is the same as you do, the level of secularization probably runs a lot deeper than even the numbers suggest. 

I also remember reading somewhere that the trend among Catholics to call themselves Catholics even though they don't actually practice their religion is stronger than it is amongst Protestants. 

However it is impossible to determine what is the truth or not as any statistics you have are either based on religious registration or on polls, both of which would hide actual religious affiliation; either by being registered while being secular and not bothering to unregister (like me) or by saying you are religious while you might not be. 

So yeah, pretty difficult subject to be conclusive on.

Either way I found my statistics in my mailbox:

The church however is not the spiritual source of guidance it is in some countries, it is practically just a scaffolding for identity and national values.

Only that Stockholm court is getting mentioned in Russian press, so it is probably named in the contract as the court that has jurisdiction. This is not unusual - it's a widely recognized international arbitration court, and is often involved in cases with ex-Soviet countries. Thus far, nothing unusual about the situation.

The compensation amount is a bit more unclear, I don't know if the figures are actually named in the contract, but again according to the press, Russia can demand money back on the deal itself (1.3 billion), and up to 800 million additional compensation for each of the ships not delivered. So 1.3 billion + 800 million each for two ships seems to be where they're getting the figure of up to 3 billion.

As for the hardware Russia wants and would be getting (or maybe I should now say, would have been getting), they are of course not getting a lot of NATO systems, and they would of course be wary of many backdoors. It is actually really hard to find information on what exactly the ships have been built with, but at least initially, it was widely recognized that Russia is interested in SENIT-9 and SIC-21 systems, these are command systems that apparently well ahead of what Russia has. This tech would improve Russia's current capabilities and could be used by them in the future to build their own ships (Russia's plan was, and still is, to get the two ships from France but then to build more of them).",0,1417007788,null,0,false,0,cmdivee,t3_2nfafc,t1_cmdivee,t1_cmdhbbo,null,1425832871,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Das hört man auf dem Schulhof, wenn ein Schüler dem anderen klar macht, dass er nicht nerven, nicht stören soll. ""Geh mir nicht auf den Geist"", sagte man früher, und möglicherweise hat es den Pennälern irgendwann einfach Spaß gemacht, den Geist durch das absurde Scherzwort zu ersetzen. Eine andere Erklärung reicht bis um 1900 zurück. Damals war der Bowler ein beliebter Hut, in Deutschland als Melone oder Glocke bekannt. Nach seinem ersten Träger Thomas William Coke, dem Zweiten Earl von Leicester, wurde er auch Coke genannt, woraus deutsche Wandergesellen ""Koks"" machten. Durch Verballhornung könnte daraus der ""Keks"" entstanden sein. Eine dritte Deutung führt die Bezeichnung ""Koks"" auf das jiddische Wort ""gag"" zurück, das Dach bedeutet. Daraus sei dann der ""Keks"" als Synonym für Kopf entstanden.

Actually not. Few east European migrants (only 8%) have low educational achievement, and much fewer as a proportion compared with the UK natives (53%).

Migrants in general are much better educated than the locals.

There might not be any changes at all for the common secretary who suffers sexist comments in a shitty paid job every single day even when there's women in high ranked positions in that company.

The point is,...to actual change things you'd have to start in pre-school, stop telling kids that girls will grow up to be princesses that only should care about looking good and keep their mouths shut and boys to be a tough soldier or rockstar.

What kind of wizardry would be needed to make people forget about all the stuff we've teached them while they've been growing up into adults?

That's the big problem. Having s system where people have the right to freely move between countries and claim benefits there doesn't work unless the levels of benefits and cost of living is fairly consistent between countries. With more, poorer nations joining the EU and gaining this right, it's inevitable that there is a migration from the poorer nations to the richer ones, which is harmful to both.

One solution would be to make the source nation responsible for paying for the migrant's benefits (at the same level that they would receive in their home nation) until they've been employed and paying tax for a certain amount of time.

Another option would be to have an EU-wide agreement on a basic level of benefits, with nations having the option to pay additional benefits to their own citizens without the requirement that they pay this to recently-arrived immigrants.

I was told that it is a fair statement to say that many Britons (rather English) don't see themselves as equals compared to other Europeans. They think of themselves as more 'civilized' than the continentals. They don't want to share theirs (money, lives, etc.) with the rest because they feel that they don't get anything 'decent' in return and just give away their 'superior' goods. 

The historical roots are apparent. Starting with emergence of an english national consciousness during protestant revolution when they faced off with the Habsburgs who represented a large portion of the european 'nations' at the time. 
Exemplified by the iconic defeat of the spanish armada the English turned the *We can stand for ourselves! We don't need anyone!* attitude into a fundamental part of their national consciousness, feeding that mentality over the coming centuries.

The superiority part is a product of Britains preeminent role during the 18th and 19th century. Being number on in terms of trade, finance, war and industrial power for 200 years does have an impact on a national consciousness.

Some Brits are put off when I joke about *My condolences for winning the war!* but I'm only half-joking because I feel that we Germans got a clear cut after the 1914/45 apocalypse. Every entity or concept of power, hierarchy and reasoning that shaped our national consciousness in 1914 is dead or under constant scrutiny.

They were the army of the Irish Republic, which was an unrecognized government (with the exception of the USSR) and existed for 3 years before being replaced by the Irish Free State and then Ireland. The IRA went on to exist with both the IFS and Ireland denouncing them.

&gt;The ""we were following orders"" defence works complete

Again no, the IRA was autonomous from government, there were arrangements to swear allegiance to the Dáil during the existence of the Irish Republic but that never happened. On top of that the IRA within itself gives a lot of autonomy to its branches and even its members. There was no proper command chain, only loose consensus. 

&gt;Good. then why did you point out that they weren't ""the actual army""?

Because your original comment made it sound like you were of the opinion that they should receive military trial or be treated as such. They were not military, their commanding officers (which by the way might be implicated in these trials) are not automatically responsible for their actions. They are to be tried as citizens.

false,John_Wilkes,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Given that a lot of notable British manufacturers are owned by foreign companies, most of them within the EU, and more than half the shares in quoted UK companies are owned by foreign investors, I do not share that overly optimistic 'nothing will change except membership' view.

You've just made clear in your own description that a hell of a lot of companies and shares are owned by non-EU people, whom we have no economic integration with, other than the odd FTA. Given that that's possible, the exact same can happen with EU investors.

&gt; In fact, a major reason a lot of companies have assembly lines and head offices in Great Britain is not the British market alone, but the access to the EU. A lot of those companies will most likely shift their operations within EU borders in order to preserve that access and downsize their activities in Great Britain according to its market size.

And with a FTA we would have access to the EU. 

&gt; The remaining EU countries most likely will not just bid a happy farewell but do what they can to protect and widen their own market shares and prevent any precedent for further 'opting out'.

If they want to protect their own market shares, they will want to maintain their significant trade surplus with the UK. That means an FTA.

&gt; Even now, overseas companies doing major business within the EU need to have plants and offices set up within the EU. British companies catering to EU markets would most likely need to do the same.

British companies already have plants and offices within the rest of the EU. This doesn't make any difference.

&gt; Now London still is the main capital market of the EU. If Britain leaves the EU, this also will most likely change.

It was also claimed London would lose its status as a financial centre if we didn't join the Euro. That turned out to be absolute bollocks, and so is the claim in this case. London is a major trader in the dollar market, despite not being in the US, and we can do the same in the euro market.

That's not true. The common visa for Schengen has left UK tourism and business as a disadvantage. For a Chinese tourist going to 'Europe', they can get the Schengen visa and see a tonne of Europe but not the UK. It's one of the main reasons tourism to the UK is so low from China, despite British cultural exports arguably being the strongest of the EU. 

That isn't to say I support joining Schengen, the drawbacks in terms of losing the ability to stop illegal immigrants at the borders are too large, but it's not true to say there are no advantages.

Of the people that voted for independence, many were traditional Labour voters. Since the referendum, the Labour share of the vote in Scotland has collapsed, whereas the Conservative share of the vote has stayed consistent.

&gt; The distaste for UK right wing in Scotland is so strong that I very much doubt they're going to listen to any promises conservatives make, no matter how appealing they might sound. It is practically impossible for Tories and UKIP to gain any ground in Scotland. 

In the EU elections, of the six MEPs, Scotland elected a UKIP MEP and a Conservative MEP, both of whom increased their share of the vote compared to the previous EU elections.

&gt; Scotland does not want to stay in a conservative UK. They've been making that abundantly clear for decades now. This is why Labour was - and still is to some extent - so important to keeping the Union together. On the other hand, every conservative victory is another nail on the UK's coffin. 

The UK isn't Conservative: the UK is a country with regular elections and regular changes of government.

The quota is for boards of big listed companies only. It is not difficult to find highly skilled women for 1/3 of their seats.

I don't think this will change much for ""normal"" employees, since a lot of the pay gap comes from job description - we tend to pay managers and STEM-people above average, and in both fields men are more prevalent. 

But you mentioned how many people (and a lot of the media) still tend to teach conservative role-models to children. - Here lies the actual strength of the policy: Seeing more women in high positions might encourage young women for an ambitious career.

Well, I can tell you that in Romania your media's current frenetical campaign against Eastern European migrants in general (and against Romanians in particular) has the very opposite effect of what you want. 

Low-skilled workers heading your way aren't even aware of it as they're not the ones reading your press or international message boards, meanwhile among university students the UK is starting to look like less and less of a hospitable destination.

Italy and Spain have a massive amount of Romanian immigrants (1 mil each) and the huge majority are low-skilled workers, while the UK is by far our biggest brain drain. A blue collar worker can get by with just the basics of a language, whereas a doctor or a teacher has to be fluent. That's why the UK has been for years now the most attractive destination for the educated here, because it's one of the only 2 European countries that wouldn't require them to have to perfect a 3rd language to do these kinds of jobs.

Also it's pretty safe at night so a sneaky trip out of the hotel should be on your cards.  Very much so for Salamanca as it's a student town so the night life is pretty rocking.

If sneaking doesn't take your fancy you can still just hit up the bars and do a a tapas crawl.  Nobody will ask you to leave a bar in spain as long as your actually ordering something.  You should be able to hit around 5 different bars for food.  Won't cost you much more than 20 euros i would have thought, unless prices have rocketed since last year when I did it.

One final note tho, it is illegal to be caught drinking on the streets in spain (unless you're standing/sitting outside a bar).  From personal memory we always seemed to end up hiding behind an electrical sub station swigging Spains infamous Calimocho (that's Coca Cola mixed with the cheapest red wine possible) before hitting up the night clubs.

And final final point:  Spaniards eat late.  9pm - 10pm late for Dinner.  And if you do try to go to a nightclub before midnight it'll be dead.

I never **said** the T-72 was **better** than the M1 Abrams, it merely **said** how many tanks the Russians still have in storage. And the Russians upgrade most of their T-72 tanks regularly.

&gt; Uralvagonzavod of Russia is offering a T-72M1 upgrade that includes new 1,000hp diesel engine, new smoothbore 125mm gun, new fire control system with Sosna-U stabilised day / night sights for gunner and commander and digital ballistic computer, satellite navigation system, explosive reactive armour package and the Arena countermeasures system.

&gt; Because You INSISTED on wiki. Also You used Wiki to speak about 15k Russian tanks when source they use is actually dead.

And that happens quite often on Wikipedia, which is why sources can then be looked up on the Web archive. Doesn't make them invalid.

&gt; Also I showed you wiki page where there are different numbers for those ""stored"" tanks. What site exactly will we believe?

Do you mean this link?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_Russian_Ground_Forces#Tanks

What happens if you add 8,000 and 3,000? You get 11,000. What does my source say? 12,500. 1,500 more or less, still way closer to my figure than yours. Are you familiar with the simple arithmetic operation of *addition*? Please let me know if not, perhaps we can start from the beginning with a [number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line).

&gt; Calling me ""Adolf"" does not show any bias right? Because it must be true, right?

Yes, it's true, obviously. You are obviously Adolf. Because taking something meant to be figurative as literal, after me taking a barrage of ""communist"" abuse from you, is the logical thing to do, right?

See? Here we go again.

&gt; Get over it. Russia is not communist anymore, there is no point to defend it anymore.

I have been doing nothing but condemn Russia over the past months, so I don't need any blessing from YOU, thank you.

&gt; Yes, it shows. Anti-Kremlin who just finds 15k Russian tanks for Putin.

Not me, sources. But you don't want sources. You're too busy foaming at your ideological mouth to be having any sort of normal discussion.

Agreed in principle, but there is no clear cut, ""algorithmic"" way to determine competence, so we rely (partly) on our intuition, which, unfortunately, can be biased by the precedent of thousands of years of doing things differently than what we're trying to do now.

Frankly, that's why I like the number 30%. It's not forcing ""full gender equality"". Ideally, what it is aiming for is getting *some* substantial number of women into the field/companies, then hope that our biases fade away.

Practical example of this, Germany as well: Before Merkel, there was the wide spread notion in Germany that it's not really clear if a female chancellor can work as intended, is effective enough in projecting influence on the international scene, etc. Now, after a decade or so of Merkel, there are not one but *two* current female potential candidates that are considered to have a real chance in following Merkel as chancellor. 

**tl;dr** Exposure changes biases. Sometimes, exposure has to be ""forced"".

As to actually solving the problem. You need to understand how a person goes from being Joe Public to a CEO or other board member.

For instance with STEM the gender imbalance usually happens with their parents and teachers rather than corporations.

Ce faisant, ils ont démontré une extraordinaire capacité de résistance face à une campagne véritablement hystérique, orchestrée par la totalité des pouvoirs en place, politiciens, financiers, médiatiques, syndicaux, tous co-responsables de la situation dramatique de notre subreddit, tous unis dans la défense de leurs privilèges.      
Le résultat, véritable tremblement de terre, était par lui-même une grande victoire.

Ce jour de 2014 est marqué par trois éléments importants :       

- le premier, c'est le record d’abstention dans un élection de modérateur
- le deuxième, c'est la disparition du parti vasseuriste
- le troisième, c'est le sursaut national dont vous êtes les témoins

Mon premier mouvement est de gratitude à l'égard de toutes celles et de tous ceux qui viennent ce soir de faire naître un grand espoir en France.    
D'abord aux électrices et électeurs de France et d'Outre-Mer qui m'ont fait
le cadeau inestimable de leur confiance. À ceux qui contre toutes les
pressions et les menaces ont parrainé ma candidature. Aux militants
internationaux qui ont répondu par le calme, le courage, le dévouement, la
fidélité, l'enthousiasme aux injures, aux violences, et se sont dépensés
sans compter allant parfois jusqu'au sacrifice de leur compte. A tous les amis
étrangers de la France dans le monde et d'abord à ceux de la francophonie
qui comptent sur l'indépendance de /r/France éternel.

Comme il n'y a pas de joie parfaite, je veux saluer aussi la mémoire de
Rolande Chieuli que vous connaissez tous sous le nom de /u/maldorno, grande
résistante, insoumise qui avait reçu le titre de 'juste non', qui s'est fait ban lundi matin au moment où elle allait quitter
les toilettes pour apporter à manger à /u/afrofagne.

En attendant la victoire, n'ayez pas peur de rêver, vous les bannis, les
spammeurs, les throwaways. Ne vous laissez pas enfermer dans les vieilles
divisions de la drauche et de la goite. Vous qui avez supporté depuis cinq
ans toutes les erreurs et les malversations des modérateurs. Vous les

désertés par le hivemind mondialiste. Vous les sionistes aux
karmas de misère et acculés à la ruine et à la disparition. Vous aussi
qui êtes les premières victimes de l'insécurité dans les downvotes, les
bans et les shadowbans.

C'est pourquoi je donne rendez-vous sur /r/FranceLibre  à ceux qui ont voté pour moi au premier ~~et au deuxième~~ tour de cette élection et à ceux qui les rejoindront afin de faire entendre leur voix, la voix des Français exclus, bafoués, meurtris, mais aussi la voix du sursaut national et de la renaissance de la patrie dans la France retrouvée.

They are not asking different questions, people who respond to the poll are imagining different questions due to their own bias - which is the problem to begin with.

Eastern Europe *is* Europe, and *is* (for the most part) European Union. 

When you're asked whether you're okay with immigrants from European Union, you're asked whether you're fine with *both* a French doctor and a Bulgarian electrician - or the other way around, for that matter. One goes with the other, regardless of what you may prefer.

When you're asked whether you want to live and work in the European Union, that question does not discriminate between working in Stockholm and working in Zagreb. One goes with the other, regardless of what you may prefer.

No one is ever going to ask the British people if they're okay with people with nationalities A, B and C living there, while excluding people with nationalities X, Y and Z. There's no cherry picking allowed - that's kind of the whole point of the Union to begin with.

Tipo... che ne so, non va Skype. Va tutto il resto, ma Skype no.

Il punto è che con Windows l'utonto può, circa, fare ciò che gli serve, e dovrà dare il computer a qualcuno per sistemarlo una volta ogni tot, quando il sistema si introia troppo a furia di malware e schifezze varie e la lentezza diventa insostenibile.

Linux invece non richiede (quasi) mai interventi così significativi, ma richiede spesso interventi minori. Il problema è che l'utonto medio non è in grado di fare né quelli minori di Linux né quelli significativi per Windows, e dovendo passare il computer a qualcuno che li sappia fare significa farlo quella volta ogni anno o due per le finestre, o ogni qualche mese per il pinguino.

Uno che ci sa smanettare invece si tira su Linux come gli piace e va avanti con quello praticamente in eterno.

La cosa mi ha incuriosito e ho fatto una breve ricerca. [Ecco un articolo dal sito della BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-19699581) dove se ne parla.

Sembra che questa addizionale (che e' pari all'8/9% delle tasse pagate allo stato) venga girata alla chiesa alla quale tu come cittadino e/o contribuente dichiari all'anagrafe di appartenere.

L'articolo parla del fatto la Conferenza Episcopale tedesca ha stabilito che se dichiari di non essere piu' cattolico, e quindi non pagherai piu' questa addizionale, non potrai piu' ricevere comunione, confessione, sposarti in chiesa etc.

Cosa sia necessario fare per dichiarare all'anagrafe che non vuoi piu' essere considerato cattolico (o appartenente a qualsiasi altra religione) non e' specificato.

Francamente pero' mi suona un po' strano che non basti una semplice autodichiarazione, e che al contrario ci sia bisogno di una lettera della parrocchia dove sei stato battezzato (specie se la parrocchia non e' in germania).

People are indoctrinated all their childhood through state schools, and criticising the big churches or other religious traditions is considered worse than killing children - with few exceptions like sex scandals and wasting money, but no exceptions in vital issues like church land ownership or religious teaching in public schools. Joining a non-established church (i.e., a sect) is a direct ticket into isolation, sometimes leading to people getting institutionalised - never with religious persecution as the official diagnosis, but rather with the results of everyone hating you, like depression. Fascists and other right wing factions are usually united with the religious zealots, because for them, it's only natural that power decides what you say you believe in, not truth. The basics (metaphysics again) aren't doubted by either of them. The state keeps people from leaving church for tax reasons by making the church-tax tax deductible - i.e., you pay the same if you leave the church. Muslims (and other non-state-churches - Germany has the Catholic and the Lutheran) cannot put their tax share into their religious organisations.

Living in England, can confirm.

The way in which the Empire, the Monarchy and other oppressive institutions are revered and bound tightly to the national psyche is slightly disturbing in a comical sort of way. The British Empire was just as, if not *more* barbaric than the German Empire. At this stage I'm convinced that the average Brit doesn't know enough of their own history to come to any sort of objective view on the matter; most people still think that the British Empire was some sort of slightly wayward, slightly mismanaged, but well-intentioned civilising force... It goes without saying that the heavy doses of nationalism in the press on a daily basis are a bit sickening.


As you say, because they were on the winning side of both wars, they've never really had to reflect on their own culture to any great extent. It's a pity, because there's so much [good stuff about British history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diggers) that the national psyche needn't revolve around all the reactionary shit that it does.

And, before any angsty Brit decides to get on my back; yes Ireland has its own issues. No, they're not relevant to the discussion - so don't go down that path.

When I see Germans complaining about Greece and denying any responsibility for the current condition of the continent while criticizing America for actions undertaken three hundred years ago, that makes me skeptical of your nation being truly enlightened and reformed. Afterall the Americans spent enormous sums rebuilding Europe and making European integration possible but the Germans who have profited so enormously from it still want to turn it into a 'moral story' which works but only if you start history sometime in 1950.

ie., since Germany believes it is free from prejudice and malice, and since it is rising in power and influence far beyond anything conceived prior, it is particularly dangerous.

Well, an arbitrary one is being introduced, and supposing it cancels out is bias is very optimistic, and in my view, unrealistic.

In practice, a lot of women are discriminated against before they get to be considered for a company board position, so the pool of applicant for a seat on a board of a company is heavily skewed towards men. At this point you would expect, even without any additional sexisme, the board to exist out of mostly men. By putting quota's in place at this point would lead to individual men not being picked because of discrimination.

I'd like to coin a new term for 'positive discrimination' or 'affirmative action' to better describe what's really happening: 'compensatory discrimination'. Not just is group A discriminated against, we now also discriminate somewhat against group B, thereby making the problem worse in absolute numbers, but it 'fixes' the statistics so we'll call it a win.

I can see legislation like this leading to a better world in the long term because women are less likely to discriminate against women, and getting them in the top of companies now may reduce discrimination in the long term, but be honest about it.

false,nichdavi04,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Wind turbines are useless. There is no way we could ever rely on wind turbines for a significant amount of our energy production. Even if wind turbines contributed 30% of our generation (a max operation) they would put a massive strain on the rest of the system.

The overall power produced has to match the power demand very closely. At ALL times. Power demand fluctuates significantly throughout each day, week (weekdays vs weekends), and season. Nuclear power produces a fixed, predictable quantity of power 100% of the time. Thermal generation (so fossil fuels mainly) can be turned up, down, or off completely as required. Wind turbines produce power based on how the wind is blowing. This means that thermal power has to compensate by constantly changing production to meet demand as the wind varies. If there was a significant amount of power coming on to the grid from wind when there is a low demand on power (middle of the night in summer) then there could be serious issues. As such, wind is not a viable form of producing electricity except in small quantities. Also, wind turbines take up a lot of space. Even regardless of NIMBY, there are issues with getting the power from where it is produced (in scotland) to where it is required. AND wind turbines require high capex with low guarantee on returns. Ok so the fuel is free, but it is becoming apparent that the opex of wind is higher than expected. 

There are many forms of renewable energy that show real promise and are currently being used for power production in the UK. Wind is not one of them. It is expensive, not flexible, not reliable, poor for space ecomony, and people don't want to have to see them.

on the plus side you can also get a package deal from them that includes some of the private tv channels in HD, which otherwise costs extra)

Je réagirais juste sur ce passage :

I (not a Ukip voter myself!) come from a village originally in the midlands, and now live in a medium sized Northern city. From what I can see ukip finds it's supporters in the rural population- who have never been properly exposed to immigrants, who don't know anyone who isn't British well enough to be their friend and (shock, horror) realise they are human too. 

Secondly, although it's not as serious as some in EU countries, unemployment, especially amongst the younger generations, is quite bad, so it's easy for a concept like ''Eastern Europeans are stealing our jobs'' to become widespread- creating an ""enemy"" and a ""reason"" for the lack of jobs which isn't the ""in an economy with little manufacturing/industry, a smaller work force is required so there are fewer jobs"". 

Thirdly, these attitudes are increasing because with spending cuts on public services and welfare to pay our countries debts, people are angry and blame the myth of immigrants arriving for the pure purpose of leeching off the welfare system, rather than accept the withdrawal/reduction of these services is due to policy.To much of the population, ukip's promise to tackle immigration is meant to be some sort of miracle cure to all our social problems...

So the officer defused the situation, had control of his gun, got out of the vehicle, drew his gun and shot Brown. 

At the moment when he shot brown the danger he was in before (that brown could have gotten the gun and shot wilson) was already past. 

Wilson should have reached for his taser, pepper spray, or just shot brown only once and not six times all of that would have been more justifiyable then shooting the guy six times. Doesnt matter if in the back or the front. 

I would even understand if wilson shot him directly from the car - assuming that brown was standing directly in front of the car window, tried to get the gun, wilson managed to keep it and just pressed the trigger - but from all what we know that was not the case - brown was more then 2 feet away from the car when he was shot (probably more though) and his body was even further away indicating that he was on retreat anyways. 

and that is the problem - as soon as the imminent danger passed Wilson should have switched from ""my live is in danger"" to ""the threat has passed i have to apprehend the guy"" and that didnt happen.

You see, in Poland for instance woman were often seen as ""less capable"" to work because the legislation gave them almost unlimited access to leave in case of the pregnancy. Of course, officialy the leave was granted for the woman with endangered pregnancy. But in practice meds were giving it away like candies to every woman who told them to not ""feel well"". The leave was beeing paid during the time and woman had protection from laying off as well. There were cases, and they were not that rare, when woman was avoiding any work for a couple of consecutive children (so a couple of years), forcing employer to keep their vacant and doubling it with a person who had to be doing the job anyway. There were barely any controls over the meds prescribing the leaves, and market reacted with a sole possible and sensible action - cut the woman employment increasing the gender gap. Yet the things slightly changed recently - the legislation is as it was, but it added a ""fathernal leave"". Gov's institutions also begun to controll the meds prescribing the high amount of leaves, and other abuses of the system. On top of that a culture changed and woman don't perceive a children as an only priority or goal anymore, they're also more and more competent (and aquires more and more skills). Effect? Gender gap is shrinking. Market slowly, but steadily stops the gender discrimination, small-medium business is flocked by woman business owners, more and more are flowing into the top management.

Why am I advocating about the equal rules in law, not about positive discrimination and quotas? Imagine how would above look like if it were filled with quotas. Companies would literaly and massively bankrupt or escape such jurisdiction because of woman getting pregnant, dragging whole economy down. Would decreasing the amount of jobs in general, but having a perfect formal equality be worth it? I don't think so. Especially as there are others less invasive tools possible.

The article is about the provisional IRA of the 60's and 70's which had it's own ""justice"" system which was necessary as they could not exactly report their own members (or other members of the community) to the police force of either the UK or Ireland.

Unsurprisingly their particular brand of ""justice"" was not particularly just given they were essentially limited to capital punishments - executions, beatings or kneecapings were common. Their methods can't really be directly compared with the justice system of either state (which lets be honest was not without it's flaws at the time). They do seem to have done particularly badly regarding sex abuse cases.

There is also a large political element to this as they currently are quite a credible threat to actually take office in Ireland next election which would be a major upset to our current moribund political parties. They are currently doing their utmost to remind people of Sinn Fein's murky past and this scandal is perfect for their case. 

Sinn Fein seems to be going through a somewhat difficult process at the minute, swapping between their first stance of just claiming everything is a lie, continuing denials for as long as possible and then saying the struggle justified their actions at the time. They want people to focus on the present and forget their past. 

They are not much helped by their leader Gerry Adams who comes over as a typical northern Irish politician to those of us in the south. He seems very used to speaking to a polarised society. He seems to keep dropping ""jokes"" in public speaking which dont work particularly well for someone who might end up in power here. Certainly no one is goign to accuse him of being politically correct any time soon. He seems a genuinely humorous guy, but he keeps handing verbal amunition to his detractors.

I'm also a bit wary of just giving everyone enough money to live on all the time.

Cette vidéo a été auto-produite par adesias., une agence de communication audiovisuelle ludo-pédagogique. 

Chaque année, nous nous intéressons à un sujet, et essayons de l'expliquer simplement au plus grand nombre. 

Après ""génération Y"", ""consommation collaborative"", et ""si c'est gratuit, vous êtes le produit"" (à voir ici : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8Osn5_4-h-Dhxdo-ElqRjm78aQuuCAyb ) nous nous sommes penchés cette année sur la médecine avec un site dédié : www.vivonsmieuxvivonstrestresvieux.fr

Cette vidéo n'est pas forcement faite pour les 8-12 ans, mais l'idée est qu'ils puissent la comprendre (presque) en intégralité s'ils le souhaitent.

Tu en veux d'autres ou je peux m'arrêter là ? Tu donnes l'impression de défendre et cautionner ces mouvements extrémistes, j'hésite entre en rire ou en pleurer.

Ce mec est en droit de porter la chemise qu'il veut, tant que ça reste légal. Le fait est que certaines féministes pratiquent le 2 poids, 2 mesures. Elles veulent porter les habits qu'elles veulent (ce qui est absolument normal), mais veulent empêcher ce type de porter une bête chemise. C'est d'un ridicule.
Tu peux trouver sa chemise inappropriée, comme certains peuvent trouver une mini-jupe inappropriée. Tu vois la connerie de ce genre de raisonnement ?

Because he's not making a point, he's calling out yours. He isn't introducing an emotional event knowingly into an arguement to try to carry it, which you did (re: the deaths of several hundred people). The reference to the Korean Airlines tragedy was the entirety of your arguement that ""the Russians have always gotten away with a lot""/ overturning /u/three_battles ""You don't touch Americans unless you want a war with them.""

&gt; I wasn't appealing to emotion, I was pointing out how the perpetrators of MH 17 and KAL007 are unlikely to be brought to justice because we don't have much sway over the Russians and they pretty much do what they want.

That's very likely true. It's also not at all what you appeared to be arguing.

&gt;  Also, I pointed out that ""touching Americans"" doesn't automatically lead to war. Both are valid points.

The context from the Korean Airlines tragedy is entirely different from that of the US intenionally putting tanks in Eastern Europe as a clear message to RuFed. One has nothing to do with another. 

If you wanted to be pendantic to the point of pointlessness then *of course* you can ""touch"" Americans without starting wars, but in practicality America is the world's last superpower with military, economic and diplomatic might far oustripping any other nation's and most groups of nations and has shown it is more than willing to wage war to protect it's interest abroad, but if you do that by referencing a civilian tragedy and expecting that to carry your point then, well, expect to be dissapointed.",0,1417016773,null,0,false,0,cmdmcm0,t3_2ngmkg,t1_cmdmcm0,t1_cmdlv2v,null,1425831248,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Also the danger from falling ice... the same could be said for pylons. Windmills are not erected outside your front door or close to roads (not in the UK anyway).

Instinctively I think this is the wrong way of implementing this. There doesn't strike me as any point giving me a basic income, when I already I earn an income with my job. I don't need any more money. In my view there is no point having the state intervene for people like me that don't need intervention.

I can understand the case of a CBI in the case of people that don't have a job or are low-wage earners: however, this strikes me as similar to (the philosophy behind) UK reforms to universal credit reforms. However, I think there are risks in dramatically changing people's incentives to work.

&gt; In the German system that is impossible because it means Spanish authorities would need to make sure the unemployed German is properly looking for work whereas Germany would pay. Money and the pressure to look for work are closely linked here.

It actually already happens a little bit. I'm not sure if it's an EU-wide thing or not (I think it is), but the UK government will keep paying jobseekers' allowance for three months to people who have left for another EEA country. They have to register with the local employment people and follow their rules. It also only applies to the contributions-based version (which isn't any higher than the other version).

If governments really can't be trusted to do the right checks without a financial incentive then it could be combined with the EU-basic benefits idea (make the host government pay it), or the paying government could after a while start asking for evidence that the claimant is also looking for work in that country, too.


Of course, in the UK it's assistance with housing that's much more financially important. Jobseekers' allowance is a few percent of the total benefits bill. Pensions are the biggest, and housing benefit (which immigrants can get, even whilst in low-paid work) is something like 15%. If the UK *really* wants to use the benefits system to keep out low-paid EU immigrants then this is the one it'd have to look at. (However, if cutting the bill were more important then I'd suggest building houses instead).

And they won't be filled with new ones as the market will be perceived as a high-risk for that reason. I don't really believe you can fill quotas with evenly qualified people on both genders every time on every market - I find such belief highly unreasonable assumption.

Besides that is a case in a multiply topics, not only of the gender gap. When you interfere with the businesses ability to compete, you steadily loose businesses willing to participate on the market.

If you're a multi-billionaire, it is absurd that the government is going to give you, say, $4,000 a month simply because you exist. Why do you need that money? What good does it even do you? An extra $1000 given to the lowest rungs of society is going to matter a lot more to them than an extra $10,000 will to the top class. You're just throwing money away with this system. 

As for the trial, I seriously doubt that it's representative of how the system would work for the whole country. With a trial, you're giving a small number of people a leg up. If I had an extra $40,000 a year (or whatever the amount of money is), my life would be a lot better, because I've moved up in the world. I've climbed up a small step on the wealth distribution ladder. But if *everyone* gets that money, then I haven't  moved at all. 

And that's a really important thing. If I'm the only person with more money, it doesn't really impact the economy. My pizza still costs $10, my car is still $3000, my TV is still $400. My costs are a smaller percentage of my income, so I benefit. But if everyone has more money, then you know what will happen? People will start charging more for things. If pizza makers know that the government has just given everyone an extra $40,000, then they'll figure that people won't mind eating an extra $5 hit on each pizza, or an extra $100 on TVs. Prices will go up, and the benefit you're getting from the extra money starts to decrease. Yeah, in the very immediate short term, people would benefit; if you're already got in a locked in rate for a loan or something, you're coming out ahead.

Accepting those people is in reality just helping the ""people traffickers"" that take up to 10.000 EUR to transport the people to the end destination into an economically strong country.",0,1417017990,null,0,false,0,cmdmya1,t3_2nd1ee,t1_cmdmya1,t1_cmcjisv,null,1425830968,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

Ich versteh nicht, was dieser Vergleich mit den USA soll. Hier würde einfach eine Rückführung ins Heimatland stattfinden, in den USA geht man lebenslang ins Gefängnis. Zudem sinkt in den USA die Verbrechensrate, erklär das mal bitte, wo die doch ein 3 Strike System haben?

&gt;Zudem würde ich abschieben wirklich mit nem Leben im Knast gleichsetzen, obwohls im deutschen Knast wahrscheinlich noch immer angenehmer ist als auf der Straße im Mittleren Osten oder Asien.

Oha. Erzähl doch mal den Bewohnern dieser Regionen, dass du die Zustände unter denen sie leben rückständig und als derart schlecht empfindest, dass man selbst in unseren Gefängnissen besser lebt als dort in Freiheit. So einen dummen Rassismus und offene Arroganz anderen Regionen gegenüber hab ich selten lesen müssen.

Auch lustig, dass du Asien(Türkei) und den mittleren Osten erwähnst. Du weißt also schon, woher der Wind weht und wer dann vornehmlich nach Hause zurückkehren würde. Warum also die Realitätsverweigerung?

&gt;Und warum sich das ""Gastland"" belästigen lassen muss? Weil es keine Belästigung ist, und nur Leute wie du es so wahrnehmen.

Na, dann gehen wir mal bei und erzählen all den Vergewaltigten, Zusammengeschlagenen und den Familien der Ermordeten, dass sie es nur als Belästigung empfinden und es keine ist. Man soll sich da mal nicht so haben.

&gt;Straftaten werden von allen begangen.

Sicher, genau so wie Vergewaltigungen von allen begangen werden, nur ist da eben ein Personenkreis vertreten, der das besonders häufig tut.

&gt;Ich bin mir sehr sicher, dass wenn wir es endlich mal hinkriegen würden, Flüchtlinge zu integrieren und sie nicht von Anfang an als kriminelle Ausländer ansehen, die so schnell wie möglich verschwinden sollen, die Flüchtlinge ganz schnell sehr viel weniger Straftaten begehen würden als deine deutschen Kameraden.

Wir reden hier nicht von Flüchtlingen, sondern von Ali und Üsgur die hier aufgrund von Familiennachzug zugewandert sind oder sich gegen die deutsche Staatsbürgerschaft entschieden haben.

&gt;Und warum, denkst du, sollten unsere Politiker nicht in den Knast kommen? Oder unsere Polizeichefs? Es gibt immer wieder Skandale wegen illegalen Aktivitäten. Führen wir mal wirklich das 3-Strike-System ein, dann ist, wie eben schon gesagt, nach kurzer Zeit die politische Führung weg vom Fenster. Es sei denn, das Land wird korrupt und keiner von denen wird auch nur angeklagt. 

Zu jedem Thema schreibe ich meine Verachtung der Politik gegenüber. Meiner Meinung nach ist der ganze Bundestag eine kriminelle Vereinigung und die sollten alle lebenslang in den Knast. 

Du scheinst aber nicht verstanden zu haben worum es beim 3 Strike Verfahren geht. Dies endet ultimativ in der Abschiebung und wird ausschließlich auf kriminelle Ausländer angewandt.

How does that make a difference? In the process of ""calling out"" my argument, he's making an appeal to emotion.

&gt; He isn't introducing an emotional event knowingly into an arguement to try to carry it

That is speculation on your part. The fact that the event is inherently emotional is no grounds for claiming I've commited the fallacy of appeal to emotion.

&gt;  The reference to the Korean Airlines tragedy was the entirety of your arguement that ""the Russians have always gotten away with a lot""/ overturning /u/three_battles ""You don't touch Americans unless you want a war with them.""

Yes, and? KAL 007 shouldn't be part of the argument? Why not? I think it should. If that isn't grounds for a forceful, proportional military response by the greatest military superpower in the history of mankind, then what is?

&gt; That's very likely true. It's also not at all what you appeared to be arguing.

""appeared to be"" ?

Really? You base your allegation on your opportunistic, creative subjectiveness here? 

I see.

&gt; The context from the Korean Airlines tragedy is entirely different from that of the US intenionally putting tanks in Eastern Europe as a clear message to RuFed. One has nothing to do with another. 

I think it does. This was at the height of the cold war, and it was a shootdown of an American commercial airliner by the Russian airforce. I don't see how this ""isn't allowed"".

Anyways: 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-to-air_combat_losses_between_the_USSR_and_US#Cold_War

What does this table tell you?

&gt; If you wanted to be pendantic to the point of pointlessness then of course you can ""touch"" Americans without starting wars, but in practicality America is the world's last superpower with military, economic and diplomatic might far oustripping any other nation's and most groups of nations and has shown it is more than willing to wage war to protect it's interest abroad, but if you do that by referencing a civilian tragedy and expecting that to carry your point then, well, expect to be dissapointed.

Currently the United States is going out of its way to avoid military confrontation with Russia. Of course, I don't want to downplay the willingness of the U.S. to go to combat, but I wasn't critiqueing that; I was critiqueing the statement that:

&gt; You don't touch Americans unless you want a war with them.

And it is not like they sell it in the news. There are a lot of Spaniards in Germany or in UK who go there to *serve coffees and meanwhile improve their English skills*. I can tell it to you because I see it everyday. And I think that they should have the right to do it.

But anyway, Africans are persons too. They move where they think they can have a better life, just as we did, escaping  from a country with a 25% of unemployment rate. Whenever somebody says ""Those immigrants are stealing our jobs"" I can but reply ""and we are proud of it"", because I am an immigrant too and, just because I am a physicist who is working, is not any less true that *I took my job out of the market for other Germans and I could be blamed for that*.


The saddest thing is when you see some immigrants with very little or no qualification at all, whining about how bad is their situation and how little help they receive of the welfare system and that it is not fair because they are Europeans too; but still they rant about how the Africans come to Spain to collapse the hospitals. The argument of *not being European* is the same as the argument of *not being German/British/etc*. I could see some high qualified elitist ranting about it, but the fact that people in the *lowest tier* of qualification believe that they are any better just because they haven European passport baffles me. *Yes, but XXXX is European, that is the difference* is a worrying common answer when you point that XXXXX has no qualifications and is an immigrant in some EU country.

At the end, it is just a way to say that the same happens in every country, not only in UK. You say that the Spanish immigrants have high qualifications, and so many British people thinks about the British immigrant. In Spain, the *low tier* immigrants come from Africa and in UK, from East Europe, supposedly. It is the same. My point is that the same chart would be true in any country, because people always think that their immigrants are good enough but the ones who come are mostly bad.






P.S: I have struggled with a certain amount of xenophobic treatment within Europe, so I feel completely emphatic with those poor souls who have to struggle even more just because had even less luck than us and weren't even born within the EU borders.

In the last general election, no party got the majority vote which left us with a 'coalition' government, ultimately run by the Conservatives, but with some Liberal Democrats thrown in to make up the numbers and attain a majority.

Despite the UK having a ""three party"" system, it's been dominated by two parties for the better part of 100 years with seemingly no alternative, so in protest, people are deciding rather than not voting and having one of the two major parties win, they'll send their vote to a third party. Given that Labour / Conservatives / Lib Dems are undesirable choices, UKIP is the one which has chosen due to them being seemingly the most well known and organised of smaller parties. There's also been the issue of current parties flip-flopping on the issue of leaving Europe ""We'll have a referendum on it! Oh shit, opinion polls say they would vote to leave.. NOPE, REFERENDUM CANCELLED... Re-elect us and we might have a referendum!"" which has put some massive weight behind UKIP to actually make a decision on the issue.

No he's not. You introduced the scenario into the situation, he's calling it out as absurd.

&gt; That is speculation on your part. The fact that the event is inherently emotional is no grounds for claiming I've commited the fallacy of appeal to emotion.

No, it's plainly there in the text; you introduced the deaths to carry your point, he referenced it to call it absurd.

&gt; Yes, and? KAL 007 shouldn't be part of the argument? Why not? I think it should. If that isn't grounds for a forceful, proportional military response by the greatest military superpower in the history of mankind, then what is?

I'm not going to believe that you don't see the differences between an accidental shootdown of a Korean civilian airliner at the height of a time when the world was engaged in fear of a nuclear holocaust, and the theoretical direct attack on US troops purposefully positioned in Eastern Europe to be a military show of support against Russia.

I'm also realizing how absurd it is that *that* line of reasoning has to be explained to you.

&gt; ""appeared to be"" ?

&gt;Really? You base your allegation on your opportunistic, creative subjectiveness here? 

Your very first line in this thread was to respond to /u/three_battles statement by saying ""Pfff."" and then to quote chunks from the KAL007 wiki page. It's a poor workman that blames his tools for a job poorly done.

&gt; I think it does. This was at the height of the cold war, and it was a shootdown of a American commercial airliner by the Russian airforce. I don't see how this ""isn't allowed"".

Of course it's ""allowed"", you aren't in school. It's just not relevant.

&gt; Anyways: 

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-to-air_combat_losses_between_the_USSR_and_US#Cold_War

&gt; What does this table tell you?

A ... list of dogfights between the USSR and the USA...?

&gt; Currently the United States is going out of its way to avoid military confrontation with Russia. Of course, I don't want to downplay the willingness of the U.S. to go to combat, but I wasn't critiqueing that; I was critiqueing the statement that:

I wouldn't say that; ask any Russian and they'll tell you how unhappy they are about the constant encroachment of NATO, and very publicly sending a force of tanks into Eastern Europe will be taken very sorely by them. There's currently not a good enough reason for the two countries to go to war (chief of which being the utter infeasibility of a Russian victory scenario), but to say the US is doing everything it can to avoid going to war with RuFed is being far too accomodating to Washington.

&gt; You don't touch Americans unless you want a war with them.

And this is still more true than your absurd pedantry.

&gt; Indeed, there is a lot of pointless, pedantic arguing going on, and most if not all of it could have been avoided if it weren't for the dreadful ""bandwagon effect"" causing folks like you to want to get a little ""bite of the bleeding meat"". Which goes to show how little individuality and rationality matter when vulture instincts kick in.

Nobody was really rich, but nobody was really poor either. At least in SR Slovenia. And until Tito's death everything was fine. Tito borrowed money from the US (or as it's now speculated by some, sold the [Yugoslav Space Programme ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfJiNPZ38kY)), which brought rapid growth, in fact some Slovene companies like Gorenje competed on the Western market even then.

The government also made some very smart choices like giving passports to the people after the first generation of  babyboomers came of age, which allowed many to work in BRD bringing home large amount of money and it also allowed for many people to go on holidays abroad and Slovenes to go shopping in Trieste, Graz or Klagenfurt, which was something that I experienced myself even in the 90s and early 2000s. A very sought after product for example were IIRC pampers diapers, unavailable in Yugoslavia.

After Tito's death, however, there was nobody that could really hold the country together anymore as the inequalities between the republics became more and more apparent. It was also escalated by Serbian centralism.

In this time there were several crises including hyper-inflation (e.g. My father bought his [Renault 4](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQoqs2z7kETRChqihDa88xIqozuKIaw9azh57TnJJaBamaEhJ2H) for something like 160 billion Dinars in the '80s) and the general inability to get certain items like toilet paper or coffee (this had only lasted for a few years, however).

I explained it somewhere else ... it's a point at the horizon that's not constantly moving. Being in an enviroment without such ""Ruhepunkte"" is stressful. 

&gt; In regards to 'danger to avian wildlife' if birds fly into it then that's just how evolution goes... the stupid ones die. Most birds tend not to fly into things though.

This isn't stupidity. This is being hit from the side by a windmill wing at 160+km/h. Tell me again how ""better"" birds look sideways searching for objects on a potential impact course... Your ""evolution at work"" will mean ""extinction of large birds of prey like hawks, eagles and owls"" (smaller birds tend to not operate in that heights and/or open airspace).

Why do we not build an autobahn over an area having some sort of rare lizard that only exists there, but this suddenly is a case of evolutionary disadvantage?

&gt; Also the danger from falling ice... the same could be said for pylons. Windmills are not erected outside your front door or close to roads (not in the UK anyway). 

They can be very near commonly-inhabitated areas in Germany. However, and this might come as a surprise to you, people like to live not only in their homes and on roads, but also ramble the countryside. I've seen plans of a windpark nearby in the woods - at 160m height, each windmill renders an area 2km around it into a no-go area in the winter. Put 15-20 of them in a cluster, and entering the forest can be very, very lethal. 

&gt; . If people do stand under them and get hit by falling ice... again evolution, the stupid ones die.

A government that proposes electricity gathering that impedes basic and constitutionally-granted human rights (e.g. the right to roam) by willfully adding lethal elements into the picture is a government of criminals and should be dealt with.

Yugoslavia was certainly not the socialist paradise that many prefer to remember, however, for most people it provided a comfortable home, in which they had a chance to live their lives in peace and for the most part with an increasingly rising standard of living. Just as importantly, while tensions never fully dissipated, Yugoslavia did manage to build a relatively stable multiethnic society, which was no small feat in light of the bitter past of the region and the vast degree of cultural and religious diversity that marked the country's population. Especially for the younger generations, the slogan of ""brotherhood of unity"" became more than mere words, but genuinely reflected how many Yugoslavs viewed each other.

In some sense, it was only after the country fell that many realized just how much they had taken for granted and how much had been at stake. And then lost... The maelstrom that was the Yugoslav wars, not only devastated the economy of the region, but ripped the very fabric of society. In many cases, even families were torn apart. In many places, most notably in Bosnia, the tragic consequences of this madness continue to stubbornly linger into the present day.

What was good about it? It was a socialist country or soft communist, but was never under Russian influence and never part of Eastern block. Commodities from The West were freely available, and people actually had money to buy them. Unlike some other communist countries where things like Rock'n'roll records, chocolate or a pair of Levi's jeans were a things of imagination. Literacy was pretty high, middle class was thriving. Religion and display of nationalism weren't outright banned, but were shunned. Crime was pretty low, people could party or sleep on the park bench without fear of being robbed or raped or whatever. There was a great ethnic diversity and everyone was respected and had their rights respected (except the right to be nationalist). And unlike people from other communist countries, citizens of Yugoslavia could travel anywhere at anytime with Yugo passport. And again, actually had money to travel.

But of course there was a lot of baggage from WWII, a lot of bad things were hidden ""under the carpet"". Remember how I said religions and nationalism were shunned upon. Well extreme nationalist were sent to prison, which created a lot of butthurt. Economical situation started to deteriorate in the '80s, but the politicians weren't willing to change the socialist system. Then there was rise of all that suppressed nationalism in the late '80s. First in Serbia, then some other states followed. And we know what happened later. 

That's in short, my 2 cents. I have no sources to back up some of those claims, but anyone who is interested can check them up.

Because ~~most~~ lots of people might not have a job-related income soon if the economy keep going that way (Greece : 25% unemployment. Spain ? ~~50~~ 55% amongst the young.). Then what do they have ?

It's like a pension except for people younger than 70 years. Or maybe are the pensioners ""lazy"" too when they don't have a job ?

&gt; I think there are risks in dramatically changing people's incentives to work.

The current ""work or starve"" incentive (especially when the wages are constantly lowering for most workers, every new generation earning less; when some people work 70h a week for what would have been a paid internship 50y ago.) doesn't strike me as very compatible with freedom in life.

Ensuring it *doesn't* get removed if you land a job also mean you are incentivized to work for more money than just being able to pay the rent and not starve. Then people who make millions by working hard could genuinely say they ""deserve"" it without risking strangling anyone else's lifestyle immediately and without ending up homeless if you ""aren't strong enough to win the job random numbers of life lottery"".

It also means that most people even with a ""shit job"" would make above bare survival; and therefore have disposable income to spend and feed back in the economy.

As you wish. You're no less ""invested"" from the looks of it.

&gt; No he's not. You introduced the scenario into the situation, he's calling it out as absurd.

And in ""calling it out"", he's making an appeal to emotion, and that is evident from his hyperbolic wording.

&gt; No, it's plainly there in the text; you introduced the deaths to carry your point

And why shouldn't those deaths carry the point? It's a large loss of life, yet the American response is lackluster and timid. This isn't an argument for me using a fallacious argument at all. It underscores that you can ""touch"" Americans without starting war. It is right on point. You are way, way off base; you're reaching, in fact.

&gt; I'm not going to believe that you don't see the differences between an accidental shootdown of a Korean civilian airliner at the height of a time when the world was engaged in fear of a nuclear holocaust, and the theoretical direct attack on US troops purposefully positioned in Eastern Europe to be a military show of support against Russia.

I have explained exactly what it is I was responding to. Not what you *imagine* I *should have been* responding to.

&gt; Your very first line in this thread was to respond to /u/three_battles statement by saying ""Pfff."" 

Yes, and? What's your point? Is there a point?

&gt; and then to quote chunks from the KAL007 wiki page. 

Yes, such appeal to emotion, quoting Wikipedia.

&gt; It's a poor workman that blames his tools for a job poorly done.

(A) I'm not blaming any ""tools""

(B) I don't think it was poorly done.

You are putting words in my mouth.

&gt; Of course it's ""allowed"", you aren't in school. It's just not relevant.

I think it *is* relevant to the *statement I was responding to*, not the *one you imagined I should have been responding to*.

&gt; A ... list of dogfights between the USSR and the USA...?

Does this sort of facile Reddit-styled and punctuated rhetoric amuse you? Wouldn't it have been much more gracious if you had formulated an actual response to the blatantly obvious point rather than choose the chickenshit way out with a cheap shot? How many heavy bombers get into dogfights, by the way? You've barely even looked at it.

&gt; I wouldn't say that; ask any Russian and they'll tell you how unhappy they are about the constant encroachment of NATO,

Which is simply about nations who begged to be considered for membership, not NATO seeking expansion where there was no demand, and mostly done while Russia was at its weakest. When push comes to shove and military engagements become real, the U.S. seems to back down quicker than the Russians.

&gt; There's currently not a good enough reason for the two countries to go to war (chief of which being the utter infeasibility of a Russian victory scenario)

It depends on how victory is defined. Victory over the U.S.? No. Gaining more territory along the old USSR lines? Apparently.

&gt; but to say the US is doing everything it can to avoid going to war with RuFed is being far too accomodating to Washington.

Well... Obama's rhetoric leans that way. If he's not whispering to Medvedev that he has more room to move after the elections, while getting caught doing that by an open mic, he's promising Russia ""no military intervention"" without even being asked. Diplomatically and strategically weak.

&gt; And this is still more true than your absurd pedantry.

No it is not. Simply reasserting how ""absurd"" and ""pedantic"" you find it isn't going to make you headway, I'm afraid.

You were hopeless the minute you decided to hop in, and you know it.

higher equilibrium price for those goods once economic adjustments occur. In any
case, how would this differ from any program designed to reduce poverty?

Essentially we know it won't influence prices as you said because of one simple fact: Other methods of reducing poverty have not led to the same result. If poverty is reduced, according to your thinking, prices must increase to a point in which the poverty reduction was useless. But all over the world poverty is reduced, and standards of living rise. UBI is basically the mother of all poverty reduction policies.

Your gut might tell you price would increase to make UBI useless,  but real life examples have shown this simply doesn't happen.",0,1417022768,null,0,false,0,cmdp4t1,t3_2nhbcy,t1_cmdp4t1,t1_cmdmuvr,null,1425829881,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I can see that the German benefits system works in quite a different way from the UK benefits system. The UK benefits system has traditionally not been based on contributions, but on need.

Vielleicht solltest du dir erstmal überlegen, warum du genau weg willst und von dieser Überlegung aus kannst du dann schauen wo es geographisch hingehen soll oder in welchem Rahmen das passieren könnte.


Wenn du einfach nur abhängen willst dann fahr irgendwohin wo es warm ist und häng da ab. Sind meistens auch die günstigeren Länder.

false,Neredev,FRAN,FRANCE STRONK !,"&gt;Huh? Sure, 90s might have been a turbulent period, but I'm quite sure that was not the case in 2000s anymore. Baltics have never cooperated too much in the transit sector, there's tough competition there, not to mention Finnish, Russian or Polish ports. I can't see how would it have been possible for Baltics to manipulate the prices. On the contrary, competition would bring prices down.

The thing is that oil was brought to the baltic ports through oil pipelines. In such context, competition doesn't exist because you can't change the pipeline route just by snapping your fingers.

&gt;Russia, however, used its oil transits as a political weapon too, for example, in 2007 against Estonia.

This is entirely true. But you'll notice that Russia renunced to this leverage in favour of increased independance and control on its oil and gas exportations.
BTS1, BTS2, the new ports in the gulf of finland and North Stream were huge investments that effectively bypassed the baltics, therefore puting an end to the use of pipelines as leverage on the baltics.

&gt;But how are North Stream or other gas pipes connected to transit in Baltics? Baltics are not and have never been gas transit countries, gas has always gone through Belarus and Ukraine. Baltics didn't lose a cent with Russia building them.

Huh ? The baltics were always oil AND gas transit countries: look at this [map](http://i.imgur.com/NgqCYc4.jpg). There are also some minor ones that aren't depicted here.

&gt;I'm not sure where you have heard this.

Pascal Marchand's *Géopolitique de la Russie*, and the peer-reviewed periodical *Courrier des Pays de l'Est*.


&gt;I'm sure transit businesses in Baltics didn't bully Russians to get them out. Who'd give up millions for no apparent reason?

I feel like there's a misunderstanding here. The baltics absolutly didn't bully the Russians to get them out. They used their strategic positions on the pipelines routes to raise their fees to exhorbitant levels because Russia was captive of its own infrastructure. Moscow had no choice but to suck it up and pay while they built new infrastructures, to which the baltics were opposed because they deprived you from billions in transit fees.

false,dr_turkleberry,EURO,Unio Europaea | Vive l'Europe fédérale!,"&gt; I can see that the German benefits system works in quite a different way from the UK benefits system. The UK benefits system has traditionally not been based on contributions, but on need.

It's actually both. We have basically two tracks. When you get unemployed after a at least 12 month employment period, you're qualified for unemployment benefits I. Depending on how long you've worked for a certain time, you'll get around 60-70% of your last paycheck for no more than 24 months.

After that or you haven't worked for at least 12 months, you get unemployment benefits II. This was formerly called social aid and represents a minimum income. It's something below 400 Euro in cash plus some other benefits like healthcare and housing. Actually it's not very much especially when you're living in cities like Hamburg or Munich. These benefits are based on needs other than unemployment benefits I.

&gt; In any case, were the German state to refuse to give benefits to Brits, I would be entirely happy. (I'm someone who spent years working in another EU member state. It plain would not have occurred to me to seek benefits there...)

If you're a contributing part of society, I don't see the point in that statement. You're there working, boasting their economy and funding social security.

I'm not saying I'm in favour of it, but if restricting immigration is racist then it is always racist, or it's always a legitimate public policy objective. Calling out racism is just muddying the issue and preventing true discourse. 

I believe the UK is incredibly cramped and I would rather there be a system of immigration control otherwise in 30 years there will be no green belt at all because our out of control population will have built over it. It's not because I hate other countries or races - I love them. But the whole WORLD is overpopulated, it seems logical to me our state will want to rebalance things so the burden is spread elsewhere. France and Germany may be just as inviting to immigrants but they're also much bigger and can take the overflow. 

That said I'm not a hypocrite and if restricting the freedom of movement of others into the UK is necessary, I will accept my freedom to move elsewhere being restricted. But the point is that 'freedom of movement' is a utopian ideal that in realty hits a lot of practical snags.

I'd rather not say how it got there, let's just be happy it is available for everyone to read ;-)

Anyway, I skimmed it a bit and here's a very important quote from page 21 of the study:

&gt; It is crucial for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to better understand the course of vocational interest development and the factors contributing to individual differences in interests within the same sex. Why do some women become more interested in the STEM fields than others? Which stage in the developmental process is critical for the development of science and engineering interests? What factors may thwart or promote the development of science and engineering interests? To the extent that future research can answer these questions, it becomes possible to provide appropriate intervention for increasing girls’ interest in the STEM areas or attracting women to work in the STEM fields.

As you can tell from that paragraph and from the conclusions at the end of the document, the differences in interest do seem to match the outcome we are observing, i.e. the distribution of men and women in the respective fields. However, it does not tell us how these interests are shaped, especially whether they are something biological or caused by nurture and culture. The authors refer to some papers that I didn't look into because it doesn't seem like these papers will point to biological reasons: from the paragraph I quoted you can see how self-evident the authors consider the idea of attracting women towards STEM fields – they don't even argue any more about why it needs to be done, they just try to provide information so that society can find a way to attract them.

Thank you again!

Also, on a side note, for a moment there I was starting to think I had to revise my position on this issue. No, really.

Another issue, which you pointed out, is that the likes of Scotland, Ireland and even Wales have perfectly fine or low population density. England is the main problem, and I imagine a very high percentage of immigrants move to England rather than the rest of the UK. I don't have a source but I'm sure if you just looked at the statistics for England instead of the whole of the UK it would be much worse. 

I'm by no means comparing whatever issues we might have with other countries like India or China but to ignore it is moronic and to dismiss it as not an issue because other countries have it worse isn't fair.

OK, that's two slightly different points:

1. A net contributor doesn't receive no money from the EU, it just means its contribution is bigger than its receipts. The UK received about £5.3 billion from the EU in 2013.

2. The issue involved doesn't really have anything to do with net contributor or not, though. All countries agree what will be funded out of the EU budget, across the whole EU, and that agreement is a commitment from the member states to fund that spending. What has happened is that the projects have happened, but the member states haven't come through on their commitment.

So in the case of the UK or any country, what's happening is that there's a gap between what the countries agreed they would fund, and which the EU has therefore gone on to fund, and the money that they have actually provided.

Of course, I was too young to have had a political stance about Yugoslavia in the 80s, but I remember the wars very well, and I know what my parents and relatives told me, and their friends. And they say that although Yugoslavia was superficially less authoritarian on the surface than say USSR or the Eastern block, since it its citizens could travel and work abroad, the reality is not everyone was given that privilege and the secret police (UDB) was as powerful (if not more) as Stasi or KGB. In truth, you couldn't say anything critical of socialism, Yugoslavism, Titoism, or any other ""holy cow"" of the system unless you were prepared to be put on black lists, excluded from finding employment, monitored by secret police, and even tortured or killed if you presented a big enough threat. In fact, many dissidents who escaped Yugoslavia were hunted down and murdered by UDB in the 70s and 80s with frightening regularity. 
The state bureaucracy, military and secret services were dominated by Serbs, who, at one point made up over 70% of all government employees (with less than 45% share in total population) and Croats, who made up over 20% of the population were represented with less than 10%, as much as Montenegro, which made up around 5% of the population of Yugoslavia. People could end up in jail or worse just for singing patriotic songs, like ""Vilo Velebita"" or ""Ustani Bane"" (I encourage you to seek out lyrics to those songs so you can see that there is absolutely nothing objectionable in them apart from mentioning Croatia by name).

As for ""brotherhood and unity"" that was a complete sham as well, which I can attest to since I, a Croat, lived in Slovenia with my parents (who came there for work and stayed for 14 years). Most Slovenes disproved of what they called ""southerners"" and treated them as undesirables. My first memory of being shunned for my background was when a little slovene kids parents wouldn't let me play with their son (but let my other slovene friend do so when i was not around) just because I was a ""southerner"" and apparently we were scum. My parents have many anecdotes about how they were treated as ""inferior"" or ""undesirable"" even though they were both university graduates with very good jobs (in the context of what was considered a good job back then).

Add to that a decade and a half long recession that lasted from mid 70s to the end, and you have a very sad state of affairs by any metric. Its no wonder that extremists seized power in the 90s, Yugoslavia was a big lie bursting at the seams long before that.

I would agree if you added it on top of the current welfare system. But a basic income system should ideally replace the means-tested welfare system entirely to be allowed to perform optimally.

&gt; Wouldn't it be better to just give a tax cut to everyone, with lower earners getting a bigger cut?

The problem with that is outsourcing and automation. Companies continue to outsource jobs to countries with slave labor conditions to cut down their costs and pass on profits to shareholders. 

Automation is becoming even cheaper than slave labor, even factories in China are getting rid of their dirt cheap workers in favor of even cheaper and more efficient machines. 

This will of course spread from manufacturing to the service sector as well, take self-driving cars for example. Human truck and taxi drivers could be mostly replaced by more reliable machines in 10-20 years. 

Then we have artificial intelligence, supercomputers like IBM Watson which can already detect and diagnose certain types of cancer more effectively than human doctors ([also beat humans in Jeopardy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFR3lOm_xhE)), will likely replace human physicians in 20-30 years.

Le truc c'est qu'il n'y a pas de manque de développeurs informatiques mais d'ingénieurs informatiques, hors 42 est loin de former des ingénieurs.

De plus il existe des diplômes qui forment des développeur informatiques comme le DUT Info après lequel on peut aisément faire une License Pro.

Enfin, travailler en SSII ne se résume pas à coder bêtement, au final c'est qu'une petite parti du temps de travail, il y a la compréhension de l'entreprise, un peu de management, etc ... bref, pas du tout adapté à 42

Je ne nie pas que cette école a le potentiel de former de bon développeur au sens stricte du terme, mais des postes de développeur pur ça n’existe quasiment pas en France. Même en développement web, ça se fait souvent dans de petites entreprises dans lesquels l'employé aura besoin de compétence beaucoup plus large que ""coder"".

Bref, Xavier Niel a inventé les nouveaux ouvriers précaires de demain, des développeurs qui codent toute la journée devant un écran et ne font aucune autre tache pour 1200 € net par mois.

&gt;Holy shit, troll harder.

It's a recurring theme from Americans , I'm not sure how I'm trolling. Or is trolling just people saying things you don't like?

&gt;You counter his factual comment which is full of supporting details with dismissal and hyperbole.

where's the hyperbole?

The majority of our (half of the) country is atheist. Even though our region was historically protestant (Luther coming from here and all that).
You will still see a lot of churches, but that's where the religion in public ends besides the Christian ambulance services (?) like the Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund, Johanniter Unfall-Hilfe and the Malteser Hilfsdienst. Most young Christians are only Christians because their parents were and mostly don't really believe in it, they just keep it because of traditions or quit later in life.
In school you can choose between Ethics and Religion, most people choose the first. 
One of the most popular political parties are the Christian Democrats, but people don't vote for them because they're Christians. 
WW2 made many people atheists, and the German refugees from Eastern Europe brought Catholicism. And the 40 years of socialist rule made most people atheists. Personally, my hole family is atheist.
