Personal opinion follows, and I reserve the right to be wrong. Which I probably am.

We don't dislike you in the UK, but several things are culturally different and somewhat jarring to some Europeans. Personally I find the hysteria regarding 'socialism' to be tricky, especially with your reliance on healthcare for profit, and prisons for profit. These are things that in much of Europe belong to the state, and rightly so.

The USA is the epitome of consumerism and capitalism, often taken to what can seem an absurd degree. Your culture of blatant manipulation of the masses via the media is depressing, as are your Republican politicians. The idea of your political class being sponsored by corporations seems pretty odd.

In terms of your other points, you entered the Second World War only in 1941 after you were attacked by Japan and Germany declared war on you. We had been fighting alone, and begging for your help since 1939.

FDR was in a political bind and there was no desire for war in the US.

Read about the negotiations we had to go through to get some old WW1 destroyers from you, in return for naval and military bases around the world.

You have been involved in some awful things around the world, including the overthrow of democratically elected governments, and assassinations and all the rest, but you know this.

On the plus side, you have acted as the arsenal of democracy, shielding us during the Cold War, and parts of your culture have enriched the world beyond measure. Personally I have found every American I have had the pleasure to meet to be wonderful.

I think many of us feel that the US has taken several wrong turns, but you are still a young country. We in the UK have had several hundred years of Empire, running round killing everyone and stealing their countries so we're really in no position to judge. Our government is absolutely a shower, and as a country we are in the process of readjusting from being a world power to a minor player on the world stage.

I echo the point that Europe is many different cultures, you cannot generalise. We also cannot generalise about the US, because you also have many different cultures in one huge country. As a people you are often fantastic. Your political decisions and exercise of power has sometimes been suspect, but so has everyone's.

Hope that vaguely helps.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;It seems that Europe has always been relatively demeaning towards America.

It seems that way because many Americans are more politically correct about nationality than Europeans tend to be.  In the US, it is not considered normal or polite to aggressively criticize or mock people for being foreign.  Americans are obviously more likely to experience European mockery of America, but the US is not the only target.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Support families more through tax cuts after kids, less through handouts (so wealthier or at least working people are more incentivized to have more kids than poorer or not working people)

In Norway, everyone gets the same amount of money when they have kids, regardless of income. The right parties are the ones who want to give handouts to only the less well off. 

&gt;Right-Keynesianism: yes, fuck austerity, yes, boost spending and demand - but it is better to do it via tax cuts on the poor and middle class.

Has keynesian economics ever really worked?    

&gt;Joint family taxation (arguably conservative - if wives, mothers can basically earn money by not working, but just being a tax cut on the income on the man, it is arguably conservative - it incentivizes traditional roles i.e. housewifing)

Does anyone think this is a good idea? Honestly? The stay at home wife. I really thought we'd moved on. 

&gt;Basic Income - with a HEAVY cut in welfare and most importantly welfare bureaucracy. One size fits all - no extra welfare for extra problems except for a few special ones like truly serious disability. Basically the idea is to encourage self-responsibility: if responsible and less responsible people get the same kind of handout and there is no handouts earned with less responsible behavior, it encourages it.

Not center right. 

&gt;Wage supplementation and/on specific tax cuts. Basically instead of paying a disabled person in a wheelchair to do nothing just live on disability, rather incentivize their employment in e.g. office jobs by for example making them exempt from employer paid things like social security.

I don't really understand your point? The main goal is always to get people to work. Those that can't, get to live on welfare. Those that can, get help finding work. That's the whole point of the welfare state. 

&gt;This is obivous, but support small family farms. What is more conservative than traditonal village living? There are whole villages becoming empty today! Government should buy up, lease out small homesteader farms to enterprising young people.

As far as I know, most small family farms don't make money without massive subsidies. This is not conservative, and I don't see how it's obvious. 


&gt;Accept that spirituality is a vital role in the psychological health of many people - and this ranges from traditional religion to yoga or meditation classes. Not sure how, but gear policy in a supportive way.

I'm not sure how, either. This seems very weird and unnecessary. 

&gt;Focus more on classical literature, classical culture. Accept it is the basis of European identity.

This is a horrible idea. I'd rather see some good new European movies, games and music. I'd rather see and experience modern European culture than living in the past. And I'd like to export our culture, the way the US and Japan do.


&gt;Many countries either have gay marriage or registered partnerships. As long as those partnerships guarantee important rights, don't bully those countries into full marriage. Accept cultural differences between countries. Gay adoption is OK but sort of it should be a stable two-adult household.

This one I agree with. But as far as I know, no such bullying has taken place.

I have a theory - American stupidity is far, far more visible on Reddit than stupidity from other countries, simply because it is far more popular in the US. Finding Reddit is low-effort - somebody you know will probably tell you about it eventually. Having the initiative to find a website that not too many people use speaks of at least a certain level of intelligence.

Also, your stupid are louder than anywhere else in the world (even my country). But that's probably just a cultural thing.

* The cultural difference between Vermont and Missouri is more than that between Scotland and Serbia.
* We saved your asses in WW2/Europe would be a Nazi state without us.
* America is big, we can't implement European policies like healthcare/American states have the independence to set their own laws so some states may suck (this is a contradiction, you've got to be really thick to not see it).
* Oh, you're British? What's it like living on Knifecrime island, an evil 1984 Orwellian dystopia with cameras in every bedroom?

Leopold II died as the King of Belgium, so he wasn't deposed, and in any case Belgium wasn't the legitimate owner of Congo, so it wasn't theirs to give (at least under the same canon that currently judges other colonial powers). 


But I'll go through your points:


* The Belgian state and Belgian people had no hand nor say in the colonization of the Congo;

You say that there were barely any Belgians working for the CFS, well the Aztec Empire was destroyed by less than a thousand Spaniards and 200,000 [Tlaxcalas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlaxcala_%28Nahua_state%29), yet the whole world sees it as an infamy made by Spain.

* The Belgian state and Belgian people had no hand nor say in the exploitation of the Congo Free State;

Most Spaniards had no word (because Spain was a monarchy ruled by [an Austrian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor)) nor hand in the Conquest of America, for example my ancestors are converted Jews (who were forbidden to visit America) and farmers (who were too worried about their cows to care about conquest). Also, most of the conqueror's descendants currently live in South America (not in Spain).

* The Belgian state and Belgian people had no interest in and no profit from the Congo Free State;

Most of the silver from Peru ended in Swiss hands due to the custom of our kings of hiring [mercenary armies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_mercenaries#Service_in_the_Spanish_Army), while the Spanish people suffered famines, poverty and plagues.

* The Belgian state and the Belgian people were the ones that put a stop to the horrors of the Congo Free State.

At the first time they were ever asked [\(in 1812\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Constitution_of_1812) the Spanish people accepted the independence of the Colonies (with the exception of Cuba, that was considered part of the Spanish territory and whose citizens were part of the Assembly). Unfortunately the French decided that we needed a King and our French king reneged of our agreement and tried to reconquer the territories (but without the peoples consent). 


**Conclusion:**

With everything I've written I'm not trying to claim that somehow the Spaniards were heroes and the Belgians villains, nor the opposite, just that the Actions of the Conquistadores aren't that different to what happened in Congo, yet the world (and most Spaniards) consider it one of worst actions, while most Belgians consider that, as their grandparents weren't directly responsible, then Belgium had no responsibility, and really I can't see how Spain is responsible if Belgium isn't or conversely how Spain is responsible (for something done by  Austrian kings with less than 10,000 Spaniards) yet Belgium isn't.",0,1400007846,null,0,false,0,chh22zg,t3_25da2d,t1_chh22zg,t1_chgyw9g,null,1433780528,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

However, the aid that the US gave UK during WWII was actually very generous.

To quote the [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4757181.stm):

""In a nutshell, everything we got from America in World War II was free,"" says economic historian Professor Mark Harrison, of Warwick University.

The loan was really to help Britain through the consequences of post-war adjustment, rather than the war itself. This position was different from World War I, where money was lent for the war effort itself. 

Under the programme, the US had effectively donated equipment for the war effort, but anything left over in Britain at the end of hostilities and still needed would have to be paid for.

But the price would please a bargain hunter - the US only wanted one-tenth of the production cost of the equipment and would lend the money to pay for it. 

It's easy to cough and splutter at the thought of our closest ally suddenly demanding payment for equipment rather than sparing a billion or two as a gift.

But the terms of the loan were extremely generous, with a fixed interest rate of 2% making it considerably less terrifying than a typical mortgage.

What we do not like on a fundamental level is:

* The US spying on us

* The US creating wars all over the place and let us take the immigrants

* The US anti terror laws that have affected us.

* US foreign policy in general

Minor things many Europeans don't like:

* Overly sensitive, everything is NSFW, bleeped, everything is racist (even if its a Britt telling a simple joke about the French),

* Americans are loud. WOOOP WOOP WHISTLE WHISTLE YEAAAH WOOOP when you come to visit us

* Americans thinking that America is some amazing place with freedom. It's a joke, we have more freedoms in each European country than you do in the US.

* All the crap such as GMOs, washed minced meat etc. that you try to lobby for us to allow

* American lack of knowledge of other countries

* Lack of respect for historically significant buildings/monuments in Europe. Don't climb up our monuments and take stupid ass pictures. It's most likely been there for close to a thousand years or at least 400 years. Just because you don't have to pay entrance and it isn't gated doesn't mean you can do what the hell you want

Just to mention a few and of course this doesn't apply to everyone. &lt;---- That this has to be said is also because otherwise some American would come along and say ""uuuuu don't generalise or thats so bigoted"".

Dann zu meinen ""die Deutschen klauen unser tolles Englisch"" ist die hohlste Phrase überhaupt, die in Deutschland am rechten Rand der Gesellschaft zu erwarten wäre (in abgewandelter Form natürlich).
""they should stop dubbing films and TV shows and play everything in English"". Ja nee... also es gab hier mal so einen Kerl, der wollte sowas in der Art mit der ganzen Welt machen. Fand niemand so toll, endete auch nicht gut.

Ich persönlich habe nichts gegen Englisch, ich gucke auch Filme und Serien (sofern in einem englischsprachigen Land produziert bzw auf Englisch gedreht) am liebsten auf Englisch. Vorallem Komödien und Sitcoms sind so um Welten besser. Es kommt viel mehr rüber, wie der Autor sich die ganze Geschichte gedacht hat. Oft ziehe ich noch Untertitel hinzu, gucke dann halt drauf wenn was unklar ist (ich habe ja nicht sämtliche englische Wörterbücher gefressen und weiß alles).

Zum Wandel einer Sprache an sich: Das gab es immer, das wird es immer geben. Im Englischen gibt es auch genug Germanismen (gestern noch gelesen: wunderkind).
Sogar Frankreich kann sich trotz Sprachschutzbehörde nicht vor Anglizismen schützen, sie werden dort halt einfach auf französische Art geschrieben, ausgesprochen aber fast wie im Original.

edit: Erklärung zum Begriff ""Bastard-Sprache"": Englisch ist keine romanische Sprache, wie die meisten europäischen Sprachen, Englisch ist quasi ""anglifiziertes Französisch"". Die Angelsachsen kamen und brachten ihre Sprache mit. Jahrhunderte vergangen, die Sprache wandelte sich, eine lange Zeit galt Französisch als toll und die haben sich reichlich beim Französischen bedient. Sicher ist da noch mehr drin als nur das Französisch, aber dieses ist halt das Auffälligste.

edit2: Sofern die Aussage des Textes sein sollte, dass viele Deutsche nicht in Kontakt mit ""echtem Englisch"" kommen: Warum sollte ganz Deutschland das denn wollen? Die meisten brauchen es nicht und werden es nie im Leben brauchen, das was sie in der Schule gelernt haben reicht für viele fürs Leben. Wem es nicht reicht, der hat (dank Internet) genug Möglichkeiten seinen Stand aufzufrischen. Mein Englischverständnis ist seit ich von der Schule abgegangen bin auch um Welten besser geworden, weil das Interesse bestand. Meine Familie etwa braucht fast nie Englisch und hat es auch fast nie gebraucht, nur im Kontakt mit anderssprachigen Ausländern, die selbst nur die Grundzüge des Englischen kannten, hat meine Familie Englisch im gesamten Leben gebraucht (Eltern sind schon jenseits der 60, da kommt auch nichtmehr viel mit Englisch vermutlich).",0,1400010940,null,0,1400011703,0,chh3mod,t3_25g5uu,t1_chh3mod,t3_25g5uu,null,1433781257,-2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,-2

Btw, on those elections Rosa Diez got less votes than Carmen de Mairena, and then blamed it on the whole catalan society, which, as she saw it, was ""blind and ill"". Oh, and opossition to UPyD and rosa diez is also ideological, in fact, she's not very popular in many universities:

Finland actually needs more people to share the burden of paying for a country as big as ours. This has been stated multiple times since the 90s. Immigrants don't ""take"" anyones jobs as they are the most entrepreneurial demographic there is in our country. 2.5% of all businesses in Finland are owned by immigrants. That's a large number compared to them making up about 3% of our population! Those pizzerias near you probably employ 4-5 people each minimum. Same goes for your local department store cleaning contractor and small-time franchises. When was the last time you saw an all-""Finnish"" firm do any of those? Finns have a tendency to not do these types of jobs that require some business-minded effort from your own part. It's funny because those areas are almost stupendously profitable if you do it right.

I agree that Russia doesn't want to take on all of Europe.  Putin isn't going to launch a WWII style mass invasion of the continent.

But would the combined military forces of Europe take on Russia if Russia limited itself to nibbling away at Eastern Europe?

UK didn't want to sanction Russia because it feared harming the banks and investors in London.

France just sold warships to Russia.

Besonders für Bands, Paare und Familien scheinen die Schienen ein reizvolles Bildchen abzugeben. Klar ist das für Menschen jungen Alters besonders hinreißend. Zugegebenermaßen, es gibt auch schöne Umsetzungen. 


Bzgl.:""Man merkt doch wenn ein Zug kommt?!""

 Aus einem Foto allein werden aber nicht jedem die Umstände, bei denen das Foto gemacht wurde, 
ersichtlich. Die Ablenkung durch die Kamera und das Posieren ist in einigen Fällen einfach zu groß und unterschätzt um im Überraschungsmoment noch *richtig* zu reagieren. 

Versteht mich bitte nicht falsch. Natürlich ist es in jedem Fall dumm ins Gleisbett zu laufen. Ich finde jedoch, dass sich manche Leute (c. q. BKA, Presse, einzelne user) die Angelegenheit ein wenig zu einfach machen und es schlichtweg als neumodischen Trend abstempeln. Wie /u/mars20 schon sagte, bereits mit analogen Kameras wurden diese Bilder etabliert. Mit einer Mutprobe hat es meines Empfindens nach auch wenig zu tun. Der Beweggrund wird in den meisten Fällen tatsächlich ein schönes Foto sein. Aber *tötliche Mutproben* geben natürlich eine schöne Headline.

Gefahren werden häufig und von jedem unterschätzt, aber über 14-jährige, selfie-machende Mädchen  lässt sich halt einfacher ohne kritische Rückmeldungen schreiben.

Ja, das ist auf viele Fälle anzuwenden, aber in diesem Fall fand ich es einfach aufgrund mancher Rückmeldung wieder auffällig interessant, wie schnell doch geurteilt wird.

As long as we don't provoke the Russians by joining the ""rivaling street gang"" NATO, they have no problem with us living besides them, the deaf neighborhood grandmother who doesn't mind about big stuff as long as his needs (trade etc) and close friends (neighboring countries) aren't touched.

Petite question : si on est islamophobes et racistes, comment pourrait-on vouloir que l'Algérie soit française ?

Dans ce cas, [pourquoi JM Le Pen a-t-il dit, en 1958](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrlGYdIJdUQ) :

*Ce qu’il faut dire aux Algériens, ce n’est pas qu’ils ont besoin de la France, mais que la France a besoin d’eux. C’est qu’ils ne sont pas un fardeau ou que, s’ils le sont pour l’instant, ils seront au contraire la partie dynamique et le sang jeune d’une nation française dans laquelle nous les aurons intégrés.* 

*J’affirme que dans la religion musulmane rien ne s’oppose au point de vue moral à faire du croyant ou du pratiquant musulman un citoyen français complet. Bien au contraire, sur l’essentiel, ses préceptes sont les mêmes que ceux de la religion chrétienne, fondement de la civilisation occidentale.* 

*D’autre part, je ne crois pas qu’il existe plus de race algérienne que de race française [...]. Je conclus : offrons aux musulmans d’Algérie l’entrée et l’intégration dans une France dynamique. Au lieu de leur dire comme nous le faisons maintenant : « Vous nous coûtez très cher, vous êtes un fardeau », disons leur : « Nous avons besoin de vous . Vous êtes la jeunesse de la Nation »*

Pourquoi a-t-il dit :

*Si vous êtes fidèles à la France, si vous l’aimez, si vous adoptez ses lois, ses moeurs, sa langue, sa façon de penser, en un mot, si vous vous intégrez complètement à elle, nous ne vous refuserons pas d’être des nôtres, pour peu qu’il y ait une étincelle d’amour et non pas seulement un intérêt matériel dans votre démarche.* 

*Mais si vous êtes fidèles à vos racines – ce qui est en soi respectable et que je respecte –, si vous prétendez vivre dans vos lois, vos moeurs à vous, avec votre culture, alors il vaut mieux que vous rentriez chez vous, sans cela tout se terminera très mal*.

&gt;et que toi et tes semblables 

Mes semblables ? Tu veux dire les êtres humains ? &lt;3

Je ne l'ai pas défendu. J'ai juste dit que cette équipe municipale a un comportement de racailles, ce qui a d'ailleurs causé le départ de l'opposition il y a moins de 10 jours. Et que cette déclaration était inintéressante au possible et abaissait le journalisme pour son partialisme et son manque de pertinence.

&gt;Tu essais de faire diversion?

C'est plutôt l'inverse : au lieu de parler de politique, le système fait diversion avec ces d'articles de caniveau et autres bassesses du même acabit.

I know Europeans don't see flags the same way as Americans, but when you have a big, diverse population that needs to be united; symbols of unity are very important. Even if you don't think they are, they are, they have a powerful subconscious psychological effect. This symbolism **is not as important when you're ethnically bound to your countrymen.** In absence of ethnic bonds, symbols of unity are vital. Just look at what the EU flag meant to the Maidan protestors, they were not waving the EU flag as snipers shot them down because they were so obsessed with the EU bureaucracy and regulations, but because they saw the EU flag for what it really was: a symbol of a profoundly revolutionary social movement unlike anything the world has seen.

So, if if you want to seal Europe together, you need to give it a special symbol. Real quick excerpt that demonstrates why the American flag is so important to Americans **and this is certainly relevant to European Union**

...

##The Civil War made the Flag an Important Symbol of North-South Unity###
____________________________________________
&gt; The modern meaning of the flag was forged in December 1860, when Major Robert Anderson moved the U.S. garrison from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. This was the opening move of the Civil War, and subsequently the flag was used throughout the North to **symbolize American unity and rejection of secessionism.**

&gt; Before that day, the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or a convenient marking of American territory, flown from forts, embassies, and ships, and displayed on special occasions like American Independence day. But after Major Anderson's surprising stand, and as the long winter of 1861 turned into spring, that old flag meant something new. **The abstraction of the Union cause was transfigured into a physical thing:** strips of cloth that millions of people would fight for, and many thousands die for.

&gt; una scoperta fatta analizzando le probabilità di vittoria che tale mossa aveva prodotto in una storia settecentomila partite. Oggi esistono programmi che giocano a scacchi utilizzando solo statistiche di questo genere, e lavorano molto bene: una volta che i pezzi si sono ridotti a un massimo di 9 per parte (negli scacchi si parla di finale di partita) tali programmi diventano matematicamente imbattibili. 

Quelle per i finali sono le tablebases, ma si basano su un concetto un po' differente. Le mosse vengono precalcolate, e da 9 pezzi in giù riesci ad andare avanti fino a finire le partita... Hanno poco a che fare con i database delle aperture, che invece sono basati su partite che effettivamente sono state giocate in passato. (Tempo fa scrivevo chess engines per diletto, è una mondo affascinante.)

Un'altro problema che ci vedo (ma sto forse divagando) è che a livello di Big Data si trattano le correlazioni statistiche, ma non i rapporti causa/effetto. Credo sia una citazione apocrifa, ma a Von Neumann si attribuisce la frase: ""OK, il tuo computer riesce a capire il problema, ora per favore lo faresti capire anche a me?""

Probabilmente basandosi solo su Big Data e su correlazioni statistiche si tralascia tutta una serie di informazioni sul rapporto causa/effetto che per quanto più difficili da ottenere, sono anche infinitamente più potenti.

From what other foreign students tell me, studying in Germany is quite fun but you will have to learn to take care of yourself. From a monetary point of view, you probably save quite a lot of money. Tution is free (except for a service charge of roughly €200 per term that usually includes a ticket for public transport) and if textbooks are required at all (most professors don't give a shit), they are fairly cheap. Add €500 rent per month (including utility bills) and another €400 of expenses.

For another, symbols are what you want to make of them. If I wanted to be an asshole I could say that if this tree's three branches stand for the unity of Catalonia, Valencia and Balearics as I'm being told (even though that site you linked also mentions Aragon for some reason), having one branch down only makes for a better symbol of an independent Catalonia, given that Valencia and Balearics would be left in a different state.

Simple question that has pretty straight answer, is the current ukraine crisis beneficial to the US from geopolitical point of view?

Chance for expansion of NATO, increase military and energy trade, deteriorating relationship between europe and weakening of the old US rival that is still capable of upsetting US course of action if its nearby its sphere of influence...

Is the crisis benefitial for the EU? Thats a tougher one, considering that the prize is ehm, ukraine and russia returning to the relationship before all this bruhaha

First before you speak, Liberals in america are interchangeable with the term leftist. While In europe its closer to the term we use in america that is ""libertarian"".

Milton Friedman thought he got it all figured out that liberals(leftists) all they wanted as to put everybody to be dependent on government handouts. 

So he made up basic income to bait liberals, so in return for appealing to what he thought to him was somehow ""appealing to liberal's instincts"" that liberals somehow wanted to put people under government support. 

So in return for liberals supporting basic income, they (liberals) will inturn support him cutting spending on etc welfare, roads, education, military, infrastructure, social security.  Just to get basic income.

This would be the equivalent of a liberal saying to a right-winger that he'll give up support of gay rights in return for the right-winger supporting high minimum wages, abortion rights, banning crosses, open borders, higher taxes.

Yes, there really is. If the strongest powers in Europe don't even have enough bombs, let alone the logistical capability, to bomb a 3rd world country that is for all intents and purposes, ""in their backyard"", then they stand no chance against a country like Russia.

There are no excuses here. The country's of Europe are cutting back their militaries *even more*, further diminishing their effectiveness. They can't just ""get their shit together"" out of the blue. Such things take lots of time and *money* (which they are cutting back on). If they get attacked, they will be caught with their pants down, similar to what happened during WW2. 

It took the Allies years before they could get fully mobilized to effectively fight the Axis powers during WW2. It is better to be prepared ahead of time than to sit back thinking you can take care of it ""pretty quick"" if shit hits the fan.

As of right now, NATO is quite dependent on US military capabilities. That's just the truth. The European powers can either choose to continue being dependent on US military might as the ultimate deterrence, or they can beef up their military's to back up the alliance. It's their choice.

And if Finland and Sweden do join NATO, they better contribute to the alliance. NATO isn't some free protection service. Either chip in effectively, or stay out and fend for yourself.

They built that house more than two decades ago, so it’s not exactly recent or modern.

The kitchen is often a popular place to eat. It always depends on the layout – some kitchens, especially older ones, are too small – but when there’s space in the kitchen people will use it. Mostly because it’s just practical (mitigates the potential mess you make and limits it to one room, keeps routes short, kitchen tables tend to not have tablecloths, so you don’t have to worry about that).

As a whole americans wear more casual and summer looking outfits. 
Like beige pants. 
And frequently sneakers, possibly white, at work.

The french favor darker colors, black, greys or dark blue.

As you'll be there on summer it's less an issue. Lighter colors are normal in summer. 

But avoid the white sneakers and white socks. Black or dark brown leather shoes. 

Also we don't drink soda or snacks while we work. Eating happens 3 times a day, breakfast, lunch and dinner and that's it. 
You do it seated, preferably taking your time and preferably with others. It's a break, a moment off. 
You don't eat a sandwich at your desk ""to save time"" and then go for a snack two hours later, and then another one. 
It can be (in an unspoken rule way) seen as unpolite to mix food and workplace. Some crumbs on papers, risks of spills, glasses ringmarks. Seen as messy in my opinion.

**Le sombre petit secret de la Biologie**
 
La biologie a un sombre petit secret. C‘est un secret bien connu parmi ceux qui ont beaucoup affaire avec les données de génomes séquencés, mais je soupçonne que beaucoup de non-biologistes sont inconscients du problème, qui est: La plupart des données génomiques existantes (pour les génomes séquencés, allant de l’ADN des bactéries à celui des humains) sont soit erronées ou mal annotées.

Il est probable que l’ « ADN muet (Junk DNA) » n’existe pas dans les cellules vivantes. Mais il est certain qu’il existe dans génomes publiés. 

Une portion substantielle des données génomiques publiées est suspecte, à ce point, soit à cause des problèmes de contamination, soit à cause des problèmes techniques entourant la technologie du séquençage de l’ADN, ou à cause des annotations génétiques erronées. Un exemple est le génome d’Oryza sativa indica (riz), qui, sans explication, contient au moins 10% du génome de la bactérie Acidovorax citrulli. Il y a aussi un génome de Culex (moustique) avec une copie complète de Wolbachia intégrée. Le génome de Rothia mucilaginosa DY-18 contient plus de 300 gènes incorrectement annoté en orientation antisense (ainsi que le génome de Burkholderia pseudomallei strain 1710b, un vraiment exécrable désastre d’un génome).

Un autre exemple d’un génome mal tourné (on peut en faire l’argument) est celui de la bactérie Ktedonobacter racemifer, qui est rempli en amont et en aval avec des copies de transposases. Incroyablement, un sur 13 gènes Ktedonobacter  est une transposase, une intégrase ou une resolvase (et ça, c’est sans compter toutes les maintes « protéines hypothètiques » avec « comme transposase » écrites dans les notes d’ontologie génétique). Sans parler du 40% des gènes de cet organisme qui sont marqués protéines hypothètiques, on peut dire que dans Ktedonobacter, un sur quatre gènes de fonction connue est une transposase, une intégrase ou une resolvase. (Une partie des plus de 4000 “protéines hypothètiques” sont en fait des transposases incorrectement annotées en orientation antisense.) Le bon sens dit que quelque chose cloche.



Le problème de “matière noire” en génétique microbienne est bien répandu et ouvertement reconnu. Au moins 20% 28.3% (selon le Joint Genome Institute) de gènes bactériens sont annotés comme ""protéine hypothètique,"" et la plupart de ceux sont ainsi annotés parce qu’ils n’ont aucune similarité séqientielle à aucune protéine connue. Dans beaucoup de cas, il n’y a pas de concordance parce que beaucoup des séquences sont dans la mauvaise phase de lecture, ou ont un codon d’initiation mal localisé (ou d’autres problèmes sérieux). Quand Ely et Scott (PLoS ONE, 2014) ont manuellement réannoté le génome de la bactérie Caulobacter crescentus, ils ont identifié 11 nouveaux gènes, modifié le site d’initiation de 113 gènes, changé la phase de lecture de 38 gènes, et trouvé que 112 ""protéines hypothètiques"" étaient en fait de l’ADN codant (pas de gènes du tout). Une analyse récente du transcriptome de l’archée Sulfolobus solfataricus a conduit à la correction de 162 annotations génétiques et l’addition de 80 nouvelles phases de lecture ouvertes. Mais ces nombres indique à peine l’étendu de la mauvaise annotation génétique. En examinant la base des données Gene Ontology (GOSeqLite), Jones et al. ont trouvé:
Les annotations faites sans l’usage de méthodes basées sur la similarité séquentielle (non-ISS) avaient un taux d’erreur estimé d’être entre 13% et 18%. Les annotations faites avec l’usage de la méthodologie de similarité séquentielle (ISS) avaient un taux d’erreur estimé de 49%.
Étonnamment, l’usage de similarité séquentielle comme guide à l’identification fonctionnelle est moins fiable que des méthodes non-SS. Ceci est sans doute en partie une réflexion du fait que les bases de données génétiques contiennent de nombreuses données aberrantes. Les programmes d’annotation génétique comme le beaucoup utilisé Glimmer (Gene Locator and Interpolated Markov Modeler) doivent être entrainé, en utilisant une série d’entrainement (training set). Si la série d’entrainement contient des données erronées, c’est une situation GIGO classique.

true,Pyromane_Wapusk,null,null,"Le problème de précision d’annotation s’empire à chaque année (voir la figure ci-dessus). Devos et Valencia ont estimé en 2001 que les niveaux de mauvaises annotations pourraient être aussi hauts que 37%. Plus récemment, Schnoes et al. (2009) ont conclu que l’""erreur de prédiction fonctionnelle (i.e., mauvaise annotation) est un problème sérieux dans toutes les bases de données sauf la base de données manuellement gérée Swiss-Prot,"" et pourtant Artamonova et al. (2005) ont trouvé que pour les cinq types d’entrées d’annotation, même la base de donnée tant vantée UniProt/SwissProt avait un taux d’erreur entre 33% et 43%. Donc même la meilleure base de données manuellement gérée est pleine d’erreurs.

J’ai passé beaucoup d’heures à examiner les génomes bactériens et c’est mon experience que la qualité d’annotation est uniformément pauvre pour tous les gènes dans les bases de données les mieux gérées sauf les gènes les mieux connus. Par ""les gènes les mieux connus,"" je veux dire des choses comme les gènes de protéines ribosomiques, les gènes de polymérases et de chapérones bien connues, les gènes de voies métaboliques bien étudiés et à la suite. La grande majorité de gènes codent des protéines qui n’ont pas été étudiées (et qui ne seront peut-être jamais étudiées) expérimentalement.  Tous sont suspects et ont besoin d’être traité avec précaution, en particulier dans les génomes à taux haut de GC où les programmes comme Glimmer ne peuvent pas souvent distinguer entre des brins sens et antisens.

Par exemple: Pseudomonas aeruginosa MPAO1 a un gène, O1Q_25367, codant une phénol hydroxylase, qui est un enzyme requis pour la décomposition catabolique de phénols (le genre de chose en quoi beaucoup d’espèces de Pseudomonas sont douées). Si vous faites une recherche BLAST de ce gène dans la base de données UnitProt.org, vous y trouverez des dizaines d’entrées de bonne qualité sur les phénol hydroxylases de nombreux organismes (y compris Rhizobium sp. Pop5, Natronolimnobius innermongolicus JCM 12255, Rhodococcus wratislaviensis IFP 2016, et un assez bon nombre d’autres). ""Bonne qualité"" ici veut dire plus de 50% d’identités de séquences d’acides aminés, avec une espérance de ~10-50. Mais il y a un problème. Si vous prenez la sequence de l’ADN pour la phenol hydroxylase de Pseudomonas et la traduisez à l’inverse utillisant l’applicatif en ligne http://web.expasy.org/translate, la séquence de protéine résultante a une concordance de 99% ou mieux (E=0) pour plus d’une centaine de transporteurs Pseudomonas maltose/mannitol. (C’est une concordance de 100% dans 85 cas.) Autrement dit, la soi-disante phénol hydroxylase gène n’est pas un gène de phénol hydroxylase du tout. C’est un transporteur de sucre (ose), à l’envers. Vous pouvez faire le même tour avec la ""phénol hydroxylase"" de Gordonia terrae C6. Traduisez la à l’inverse et c’est beaucoup mieux comme perméase de sucre (dizaines de concordances E=0) que comme une phénol hydroxylase.


Pourquoi est-ce qu’un programme comme Glimmer manqué ces problèmes comme ceci? Dans ce cas, Glimmer est devenu confondu par une situation apparente de gène chevauché (ci-dessus). Le programme a trouvé deux phases ouvertes de lecture, dans la même partie ddu chromosome, mais sur des brins opposés. Glimmer 3 est supposément beaucoup mieux à résoudre des chevauchments, mais Glimmer 2 (qui a été utilisé à annoté environs la moitié des génomes actuellemnt disponible dans les bases de données publiques) dépendait d’une heuristique incroyablement grossière pour résoudre les problèmes de chevauchement. Dans le cas ci-dessus (peut-être à cause d’une erreur d’opérateur; ces choses sont configurables, jusqu’à un point) Glimmer a simplement designé chaque ORF comme gène légitime, quand en fait une vérification de BLAST laisse peu de doubte que le gène de phénol hydroxylase est (en réalité) un gène de transporteur maltose/mannose à l’envers.

Mon expérience est que Glimmer se confound facilement avec les données de génome à taux haut de GC, avec des organismes comme Pseudomonas (typiquement de 63% à 67% GC) démontrant un plus grand nombre de gènes inversement annotés (et de « protéines hypothètiques » à aucune concordance avec BLAST) que les organismes à taux bas de GC comme Buchnera, cependant il est à noter que même des souches d’E. coli tendent à contenir plusieurs annotations suspectes. Le problème est partiellement en raison du fait que l’ADN à contenu haut de GC contient relativement peu de codons de termination dans les six différentes phases de lecture, comparé à l’ADN à taux bas de GC (qui est riche en codons de termination si dechiffré dans le mauvais sens). Aussi un problème pour Glimmer est que dans les génomes à taux haut de GC, les codons tendent à contenir une purine dans la première position de base qu’on les lise dans le bon sens ou à l’envers.

J’ai écrit avant sur le fait que les codons tendent à arriver avec des fréquences généralement égales à celles de leurs jumeaux du complément inverse. Ceci est un autre facteur confondant pour Glimmer (les codons se ressemblent qu’on les lise dans le bons sens ou non), honnêtement, je commence à me demander si les symmétries codon/anticodon je vois dernièrement, ne sont pas simplement à cause d’une annotation inverse largement répandu des gènes (la mauvaise annotation du brin anticodant d’un gène, comme avec ""phénol hydroxylase""). 

On peut supposer naïvement qu”il ne devrait pas être difficile de discriminer le brin ""sens"" de façon précise, donné que tant de gènes commencent avec une séquence Shine Dalgarno en amont du codon d’intiation. Mais en réalité, il s’avère que peu d’organismes se servent des séquence SD de façon extensive. Des motifs courts comme GAGG, qui arrive aléatoriement à un taux haut, peut se prendre à tort pour une séquence Shine Delgarno. Ceci ne fait qu’aggraver le taux de faux positifs. 

Des annotations génétiques erronées foisonnent en bactérie, mais certains auteurs ont suggéré que le problème est encore pire en génomes eucaryotes. S’il est vrai, nous avons à nous inquiéter.

Tout cela met la recherche de bioinformatique dans la crise. Les algorithms de découvertes génétiques sont bons (peut-être un peu trop bons) à trouver les  phases de lecture ouverte mais mauvais à identifier et à assigner les fonctions génétiques, d’une part parce que il nous manque le genre de compréhension profonde du pliage de protéine requise pour la prédiction des structures 3-dimensionnelles (et des conformations de site actif) programmément, une capacité dont nous avons besoin si nous sommes à progresser de l’Âge de Pierre d’annotation génétique dans lequel nous vivons maintenant. (Le pliage de proteines est un problème difficile exigeant les superordinateurs à démêler.) Peut-être dans dix ans (ou vingt?), nous serons capables de prédire les structures de protéines 3D informatiquement, et sur cette base, de faire de meilleures prédictions ab initio de la fonction de protéines. À ce moment, nous avons à faire avec les logiciels relativement grossiers de reconnaissance des formes à modèle-Markov, aidés par l’intervention humaine, pour imaginer même une annnotation génétique minimalement fiable. Mais nous avons les moyens, déjà, de faire de beaucoup mieux contre-vérifications. Une partie de cela peut être automatisé. Nous avons tout simplement besoin de la volonté pour le faire.

Also once Russia realized there was nothing to be done there (surely they cannot imagine Finland is some how in the sphere of their pathetic yet big kleptocracy), perhaps their delusions of grandeur would diminish some.

One thing that you won't find out prior to moving is if you were married in the US, or anywhere outside of Germany, you have to get an Apostille which certifies your Marriage License. You have to get one from the Dept. of Records in the State you were married. For example, since we were already in Germany my parents had to drive to Columbus in Ohio to get the Apostille. I think the cost was $10 and FedExed it to us.  
  
Also, you may have to get some of your documents translated into German but you can do that once you get here. The costs vary but we found a licensed translator that did our paperwork for €60. They won't accept translations done by a non-German-Certified translator.

Voting works completely differently. It should be anonymous so logging has to be limited by design and it's not 'deterministic', you can't, from looking at a voting result, say whether it was manipulated or not (particularly for small changes that tip balances).

Paper voting is extremely hard to manipulate undetected, it literally leaves a paper trail and you would have to ensure thousands of poll workers keep quiet. All big elections are also monitored by international observers.

What do you need to manipulate electronic voting? One bribed sysadmin or a skilled hacker and no observer would even suspect a thing.

- Deine Aussage

--------------------

&gt;Um ihre Freundschaft in sozialen Netzwerken möglichst dramatisch zu inszenieren, fotografieren sich Jugendliche zwischen 12 und 16 Jahren immer häufiger mit ihren Handys auf den Gleisen.

-Artikel

Ich hatte den Eindruck, es ginge genau um solche Fotos. Inspiriert/Beeinflusst durch Bilder wie ich sie verlinkt habe.

So wie du das beschreibst, hab ich das tatsächlich nicht aus dem Artikel rauslesen können. 
Soll also um [so etwas](http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/train-selfie_1.jpeg) gehen?

Mir ging es tatsächlich mehr um die Form, wie das Problem dargestellt wird – hptsl. in der Presse  – schein ich nicht verständlich genug ausgedrückt zu haben. Noted.
Was das falsche zitieren bzgl. analoger Zeiten angeht: Sorry, ebenfalls missverstanden.

Was du allerdings mit der Überheblichkeit gegenüber Fotografen meinst, kann ich nur erahnen. Ich finde, sobald solche Fotos in einem professionellem Rahmen geschehen, hat der Fotograf die Verantwortung für die Motivwahl und sollte sich solche Fotos gut überlegen. Weil sich meiner Meinung nach, solche Fotos nicht gut im Portfolio machen wegen der bereits angedeuteten Verantwortungslosigkeit.
Ich würde keinen Porträtfotografen anheuern, dem mein Leben genauso egal ist wie
seins.

Dieser Standpunkt bezieht sich natürlich auf meine Ausgangsannahme. Das kann natürlich jeder machen wie er lustig ist. Ich halte es für ein ausgelutschtes Cliché.

true,SuicidalFruitFly,EURO,One World Government,"&gt; Programs can be proved mathematically to be risk free

You can't prove anything like that and it's not even in the field of mathematics to prove such things. You can prove that a program works according to its *specification*, but that is extremely time consuming and AFAIK the largest program for which such a process has ever been done was about 8K lines of code -- ie. nowhere near as big as something like this.

On top of that, if there's a problem in the specification (there will certainly be some, because people make mistakes or forget some detail or etc.), it's utterly meaningless to prove that a program works according to it.

&gt; i'm pretty fucking sure Estonia has some awesome programmers to make it fair.

This is more about software development than programming. Programmers write the code and do their best to make sure that it fulfills the requirements of the specification, but there are other people who do the design, testing and such, and who ultimately write the specification. Programmers have very little to do with this (except when they write code that doesn't work as intended).

&gt; My two cents as a programmer, is that this is either a political game, or the programmers were not interested to make something full-proof.

""Full-proof?"" Have you ever written any security critical code? There is no such thing as bug free code when you talk about any significantly sized program, and the bugs of this kind are especially difficult to find, since they don't usually affect the general functioning of the program in any way. I'm not aware of a single piece of security oriented software that hasn't been exploited at some point (the latest big example being the Heartbleed bug in OpenSSL).

You can take the most talented programmers in the world and even they will not be able to write code that cannot be exploited, unless the program is either trivially simple or receives years and years of testing and development. The way software is rushed through these days, even for critical applications like this, means that there is very little code that would pass a critical review by security experts.

And that doesn't even address all the other problems with electronic voting, such as transparency (which to me is the biggest single issue with electronic voting).

I'm not a ""programmer"", but I am a computer scientist and the day they insist on electronic voting is the day I stop voting.

I don't know who supported who. And I don't think you do either. 

The Russians couldn't have supported both the current unrest and the previous one as they are the opposite sides of the same conflict. Beyond that, Russia had a comfortable position with Yanukovych staying in power. A statement that is rather substantiated by the Russians trying to use him (then broadcasting from within Russia) at the end of the Euromaidan protests in Kiev as a puppet spokes person.

Now, the current unrest in eastern Ukraine is almost visibly approved as occurring (idk about supported) by the Russian government.

What you believe you know is a different story.

&gt; [..] after all they warned us there would be consequences and the consequences are laughable. They can't even place a full ban on selling us rocket cores or stop hauling our astronauts up on Soyuz because they need the money. They're a regional power and their attempts to snap and snarl at America are pathetic and amusing.

I will have to reiterate. There is nothing laughable. Laughable is that you think that the world has to be a stage for the fulfillment of proxy conflicts orchestrated by the USA and Russia. If Ukraine were a better organized country and people none of these conflicts would have happened.

It is *laughable* because it is not happening to you. But laugh long enough and maybe it will. It will certainly redefine television.

Hell anyone with any understanding of military strategy knows this.

Every other country bordering Russia is either a dictatorship, hates Russia to the core, rebellious, broke, at war internally or externally or threats them in one way or another. Add to that that Finland is located close to the Russian political epicentre. 

Attacking Finland would not only be political suicide for Russia, it would make absolutely no sense what so ever. We are practically their gate to the west without being dicks about it.

First of all joint taxation should be primarily understood as a fairness issue - that the same income for 1 people or 4 is not the same level of living so it should not be taxed the same. And the stay at home stuff is more of a secondary effect.

Secondarily, I think the ideal is one parent full time working and one parent part time working, because when both work full time you get your kids raised by babysitters / au pairs. Not cool. 

Joint taxation helps in the part time stuff as it is like an extra income.

&gt;As far as I know, most small family farms don't make money without massive subsidies.

There are potential solutions for that 

1) can be seen as a partial self sufficiency and not producing for sales. Useful for the poverty stricken, the long term unemployed.

2) seller co-ops. I.e. 1000 farmers could negotiate with TESCO as one unit.

It certainly benefits the students who wish to work in the EU, as they can get more exposure to it. Heck, at the Institute for Political Studies (IEP), part of the course is to spend a week debating in the Parliament with the Erasmus students. That was cool.

There are also several lobby groups that lobby hard to keep the EP in Strasbourg.

Of course, there are other institutions in Strasbourg, such as the Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe, so if the EP left, there would still be a presence. Although I do find it funny that Churchill was in favour of the CoE being in Strasbourg because then it would be ""far enough out of the way to not cause any trouble"" (paraphrased, probably)

Question: I heard that the French kind of ambushed the EU by building a massive building and then when the EU was looking for a place for parliament they said ""well, we have a building. you have to use it. It's built now."" Any idea how true that is?

2) People who do contribute back are usually finding a way to make a living too. They are just ashamed to be on welfare forever. The point is, not everybody is a highly motivated intellectual, there are slum families with several generations of bad socialization.

3) To be perfectly honest, most jobs suck. It is understandable most people don't actually WANT to do them. I wouldn't. Yet, it is necessary.

&gt;If you mean financially, then I would argue that the state's purpose is to ensure the wellbeing of everyone

That is one of the purposes.  There are many others. One is that given that the state has no independent income but gets money from taxes it acts as  an intermediary between taxpayers and tax receipients, and thus its job is to ensure a balance of fairness and justice to BOTH. It cannot just indefinitely take from one side and give to another side, some balance must be struck. Tax receipients must put out a credible effort to do something of value in return - not necessarily normal jobs, but SOMETHING.

&gt;Then it is forcing them, because if they don't work and don't receive any aid, then what happens? Hint: nothing good, anyway.

It is not a moral argument to bribe people to not commit crimes. This a punishment/reward thing. Crime deserves punishment, it is not like not committing crimes deserves a reward. 

I think you see a pattern here - I openly admit that a centre-right, conservative view is a bit moralistic. I think the pragmatic view of the centre-left that tends to avoid moralizing is caustic and dangerous in the long run.

The philosophy is: a good society happens only when incentive structures are set up so that people want to do good things and not want to do bad things. So we don't reward not committing crimes.

I think the pragmatic left ignores human agency and things like character and socialization.


&gt;Did you know that some people consider employment undignified, demeaning and generally unpleasant? What about those people? I, for one, do not like being coerced into renting myself to a master.

Who cares what you like? Do what you like from your own money. It is NOT the job of the state to ensure your well-being if you refuse to contribute back to the state because then you just leave that bill to be picked up by someone else. The state has no money on its own, only taxpayers have and this philosophy is literally equivalent to going to a well-off family and asking them to support you because you don't feel like working. This is hugely immoral.

But you are an intellectual. Probably you do something useful even when you don't work. But look at how society on the whole looks like, the slums, the multi-generational traps bad socialization.

&gt;Not everyone is the same; not everyone wants to waste their time in a job they hate.

EVERYBODY hates most of the jobs. Hello! Is this something new? Who the hell likes to clean or be a waiter or drive a truck? People do it because it is necessary.

Grow up. Life is not about doing what you like - not for most people who are not independently wealthy. It is mostly about making compromises.

&gt;Ah, so you have somehow determined what gives other people dignity? I'm not sure how you can know what everyone thinks of employment

Dignity has nothing to do with what people think. Look at a drunk homeless who is lying a pool of piss - he can be entirely happy about it yet it is no dignity.

&gt;How do you know these people do nothing? How do you know they don't give back? 

Go to a slum and look around.

&gt;Hah, it didn't take long for you to show your disdain for disadvantaged and poor people.

Not the disadvantaged or poor but for the slum-dwellers who had generations of bad socialization. ""poor"" is a shitty metric. It is just income. And two people with the same low income can have vastly different attitudes at life. 

&gt; Since you missed my point - which was based on overpopulation, strain on resources and climate change - I'll just leave it before you drown in your own angst.

I don't feel any angst - I feel like I am being a staunch, reasonable moderate. I know a lot of people who got a lot more to the right. Basically middle-class Europeans are not overpopulated compared to the rest of the world, actually births are under the reproduction rate, and I don't think just because some people in in poor countries reproduce too much we cannot have at least a reproduction rate in order to preserve our ethnic cultures and our place in the world.

&gt;'well, if you want to oppress a sizeable portion of your population, who are we to judge?'

This is why I mentioned the part that flew completely over your head - that once registered partnerships with basic rights are guaranteed then it is OK because then it is not oppression. I think your problem is that you see the smallest kind of inequality, even when symbolic and not pragmatic, as oppression. This is of course bullshit, given that egalitarianism is a progressive ideal, that means it is something to strive for, not a given, a very idealistic thing, so we cannot call everything that does not 100% live up to it oppression. And because every culture is based on some form of inequality as equality literally means not having a culture - as a culture means  that some things a preferred over some other things - true liberalism is the kind of measured tolerance that tries to strike a balance between respecting  cultures and guaranteeing basic rights. So the balance can be for example not tolerating fascist, not tolerating people who deny basic rights to gays, but tolerating people who are willing to allow arrangements that guarantee those rights in different forms. It is called compromise and a respect for the culture and views of others.",0,1400055307,null,0,1400055491,0,chhldrd,t3_25fyjg,t1_chhldrd,t1_chgxyx9,null,1433789823,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Excuse me but how is it not obvious?  I thought everybody knows that it is not the rights that draw conservative resistance but the name only.

I mean, isn't it obvious that during the last 100-150 years politics was at least 50% about names and not things? That people rarely care for actual issues, mostly they just want to hear names, slogans, symbols they can identify with?

Am I really the only one who gets it?

E.g. ""net neutrality"" draws support not only because it is a good idea but because it is a good name. If it had a worse (but actually, more honest) name like ""ISP regulation"" it would draw less support. Environmentalists are very clever to use the name ""green"" because people love to wander in green forests and live in suburbs with greenery  so it is catchy - even when enviromentalists actually oppose suburban sprawl into neighboring villages.

Not trying to be an ass but how it is not obvious? I think the most basic talent possible for politics is to understand the power of names, slogans, words, symbols, how much people care about these rather than things.

Simply marriage is a poor name for the cause because it draws resistance - see the protests in France. It is all to easy for them to make catchy signs like ""protect marriage"". If you put the very same rights under a different name like registered partnerships, it is a whole lot leasier because it is not really possible to make catchy signs against it - how would a sign like ""gay partnerships must stay unregistered"" sound like? It would be ridiculous and not catchy.

I mean this is really the basic introductory baby step level thing in political tactics, how is it not obvious?

I don't even understand why was even such a confrontational name like marriage chosen. Was it intended? Was it basically a gauntlet thrown down to fight it out with religious conservatives once and for all?

true,Gillonde,NETH,The Netherlands,"The court press release touches on that in the following paragraph:
&gt;So far as concerns, next, the extent of the responsibility of the operator of the search engine, the 
Court holds that the operator is, in certain circumstances, obliged to remove links to web pages 
that are published by third parties and contain information relating to a person from the list of 
results displayed following a search made on the basis of that person’s name. The Court makes it 
clear that such an obligation may also exist in a case where that name or information is not erased 
beforehand or simultaneously from those web pages, and even, as the case may be, when its 
publication in itself on those pages is lawful.

The original publication can be lawful, as it was newsworthy at the time of publication. It can also be kept online as part of an (searchable) archive. Removal of the original publication would be the censorship a lot of people in this thread are afraid of. 

A search engine makes it possible to find all those old articles by searching for the names of the people involved. This makes it possible to make a ""structured overview of the information relating to that individual on the internet"".  

&gt; The Court points out in this context that processing of personal data carried out by such an 
operator enables any internet user, when he makes a search on the basis of an individual’s name, 
to obtain, through the list of results, a structured overview of the information relating to that 
individual on the internet. The Court observes, furthermore, that this information potentially 
concerns a vast number of aspects of his private life and that, without the search engine, the 
information could not have been interconnected or could have been only with great difficulty. 
Internet users may thereby establish a more or less detailed profile of the person searched against. 
Furthermore, the effect of the interference with the person’s rights is heightened on account of the 
important role played by the internet and search engines in modern society, which render the 
information contained in such lists of results ubiquitous. In the light of its potential seriousness, 
such interference cannot, according to the Court, be justified by merely the economic interest 
which the operator of the engine has in the data processing. 

Individuals may request the removal of old and irrelevant search results based on their name from search engines. 

&gt;the Court holds that, if it is found, following a request by the data subject, that the inclusion of 
those links in the list is, at this point in time, incompatible with the directive, the links and 
information in the list of results must be erased. The Court observes in this regard that even initially 
lawful processing of accurate data may, in the course of time, become incompatible with the 
directive where, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the data appear to be 
inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to the purposes for which they 
were processed and in the light of the time that has elapsed.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think this is a confrontational attitude as it is much easier to make conservatives to accept if the same rights and privileges are guaranteed under a different name.

Let me ask you - is this confrontational attitude intended or accidental? You don't just want the same rights and privileges, you basically want to kick religious conservatives until they are also willing to pay equal amount of respect and prestige to you as well?

You see this is confusing because the issue sometimes looks like something about rights and privileges, which can be guaranteed under a different name, and sometimes it sounds like a culture war that is indeed about culture - i.e. prestige, respect, personal acceptance.

Personally I am neutral in this, but I think forcing respect and prestige never quite works on the long run. What happend with racism for example is that it was basically just forced underground, but in the underground it got arguably uglier. You can sort of force people out from the mainstream who don't respect you, this works. But they gather in underground places, seething with rage, and planning a brutal revenge.

Therefore I would recommend _true_ liberalism - compromise, empathy, mutual tolerance with religious conservatives, accepting that they don't see you quite as an equal in respect and prestige. (This compromise would mean same rights, different name.) This confrontational fuck-you attitude is not constructive, because invites a strike back, a revenge, an escalation of the conflict.

The fact that they are friends somehow got lost when the shit hits the fan and makes it unbelievable later on.

Also the Jew storyline doesn't fit the rest, if you ask me. It feels like they felt obligated to include a story about a jew, no matter what.

&gt;Not even a Sicilian and a Venetian have the same culture, and certainly it doesn't include the reliability of an agreement or the propensity to crime[1] .

Every Italian in this thread said that the encounter in the evening wasn't meant as an agreement, and pretty much everybody at /r/Finland thought that it was. How would you summarise this observation from viewpoint as other than ""if it's not written down, they don't think it's real""? Somebody in this thread claimed that because they hadn't talked of continuing rain, this made any conversation of the previous night inconclusive. 

Again, I'm not saying this is a GOOD or BAD thing. I'm saying that if you don't ask for a thick agreement with every possible factor written in from the get-go, the parties will separate on bad terms. And if this happens, it's pretty much your own fault for not doing things properly.   

You are the only one who talks about crime. 

I see now that when you said that I wrote at length, you meant that you didn't read it. And as such, perhaps this discussion is over.

Io sono un grande appassionato di scacchi, anche se la poca costanza nel praticarli mi impedisce di crescere come giocatore. Però adoro leggere i commenti alle partite dei GM, guide tattiche, curiosità, trafiletti di storia e articoli di informatica scacchistica. 

Dici che il gioco dei finali di partita non è legato al calcolo delle probabilità circa il successo delle mosse, ma a tabelle che indicano in maniera deterministica chi arriverà a vincere e come può farlo? Sicuramente hai ragione. Io ho dato per scontato che la certezza matematica del successo di certi pattern di mosse derivasse da analisi statistiche sui dati, ma anche uno uno studio logico rigoroso permetterebbe di avere computer infallibili.


Riguardo il conflitto tra correlazione e rapporti causa/effetto. Gli strumenti informatici ci consentono di vedere nei big data correlazioni che sarebbero per noi totalmente inaccessibili altrimenti. Queste correlazioni possono aiutarci nella vita, perchè indicando collegamenti salienti ci permettono di monitorare e intervenire su fenomeni complessi non totalmente alla cieca. 

Impareremo a fidarci di queste indicazioni come ci fidiamo dei nostri sensi: il cielo è pieno di nuvole nere e dopo un po' inizia a piovere --&gt; se vedo il cielo pieno di nuvole nere penso che con molta probabilità inizierà a piovere. Una correlazione osservata ci aiuta a vivere meglio. Poi ora sappiamo cosa sia un temporale e come questo si generi perchè la meteorologia ci ha fornito descrizioni accurate dei rapporti di causa e di effetto, ma questo è un altro discorso.

I Big Data possono fornirci osservazioni inedite di cui starà a noi spiegarne la natura attraverso teorie, manipolazioni ed esperimenti. Così è sempre stato il rapporto tra senso comune e scienza e continuerà ad essere anche quando il nostro senso comune sarà incrementato dai nostri strumenti informatici.

Not really misery, we are beyond that. The average forklift operaotr guy in Europe is not living in misery.

But this is beside the point. If it _can_ be done it ought to be done, the question is whether it can.

The central problem is that 

1) what matters is what happens at a really small age 

2) society does not have such a big influence on what happens at that.

(Although it is outdated, I have seen a 1960's sociology textbook that basically mothers talking a lot to babies at like 6 months old is alone a strong predictor of later success.)

When I was in elementary school it was already clear at 6-8 who is going nowhere: kids with no intellectual interest, not being able to sit 45 mins and pay attention, whimsical and uncontrolled, overly aggressive... and that is parents.

But I mean, by going nowhere, I don't mean misery. One married the daugther of a baker and is now working in the family bakery and if they stay together they will inherit it.

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"Law, conventions and pacts are near meaningless. The US, as well as Russia, are notorious for disregarding them. In fact, those seated and with veto power in the UN often are the biggest infractors. And the US doesn't even subscribe nor adhere to the most basic charters, like human rights.

NATO would do nothing if Finland was suddenly invaded. The only sensible policy would be to station massive troops to prevent further incursions by Russia onto more countries and try to bargain Finland back from them. That's what's being discussed now, either in the Kremlin and in neighboring NATO countries. 

Finland would never tolerate such a move because they've refused NATO, they're also idealists and trust that old bear (short memory). But bears are crazy and hungry. All this talk of snipers and kicking the red army for months. This is some absurd twelve year old talk and dangerous. Russia has the most seasoned army in it's hemisphere. Russia would wipe the floor with Finland, who are notoriously pacifists. 

In WW2, blitzkrieg and logistic made fast war a possibility. Current technology would make it many times as fast. And fast wars coupled with mass disinformation techniques will become as effective or more than any artillery or bombing campaign. Plowing all the way to Helsinki could happen under a couple of days. And it's well in Russian reach to do so.

If I were to impose sanctions to Russia, I would not do it without placing massive troops in neighboring countries. Some say it would escalate things further and trigger a reaction. But to be fair, it's inevitable by now. 

If I were Russia, I'd take chunks of land left and right and bargain my way out of these sanctions. Oh, you want Finland or Estonia back? Suspend the sanctions. While still keeping the many border enclaves and Crimeas. The alternative is Russia politically dissolved. This is textbook WW1. All it takes now is a few more alliances (China) and a trigger.

The world would be a safer place without these mad giants - Russia, US, China. Their size and chauvinistic policies are the reason we have a doomsday clock and hover close to complete annihilation.

Das Argument war aber nicht, dass Lobo das sagt und er das für sich auch festgestellt hat, sondern Lobo und andere werden als (einzige) Quelle der Erkenntnis genannt. Von den fehlenden Argumenten, die dafür angebracht werden mal ganz zu schweigen.

Und da du auf der Ebene der Logik argumentierst: Regen und Demokratiefeindlichkeit (das Wort hat Lobo nicht benutzt übrigens, er redet von anti-demokratisch und bezieht das nicht allein auf die CDU) sind völlig unterschiedliche Konstrukte. Natürlich kann man auch über die Definition von Regen streiten, aber Regen ist empirisch zugänglicher und weniger komplex als Demokratiefeindlichkeit. Der Vergleich überzeugt mich leider nicht ganz, denn wenn alle Phänomene sozialen Miteinanders so einfach und logisch zugänglich wären wie das Wetterphänomen Regen, dann hätten wir hier kein Problem - und keine Sozialwissenschaften.

&gt; ... jedenfalls ist die Behauptung, dass mehrere Dinge etwas nicht sind, also nicht demokratisch, nicht eine pauschale Gleichstellung dieser Dinge.

Richtig. In diesem Kontext liest sich die Festellung ""CDU = demokratiefeindlich"" im Zusammenhang mit ""genau wie der NPD"", aber als mittelbare Gleichsetzung, denn gerade aufgrund ihres Nichtseins wird ihnen etwas gleichermaßen verwehrt. Im Umkehrschluss hieße das ja, [dass nur Parteien, die die Mitte Demokratie treffen, die Musik verwenden dürften](http://i.imgur.com/NnoGhN1.gif).

true,yawnz0r,ANAR,Anarchy (Irish by birth),"&gt; 1) When people contribute something to society, it is a public good, so it can be understood in a very broad sense a public good so this can be paid directly i.e. money to artists or foster parents.

You're saying the state should pay people directly if they're deemed to be contributing to the public good, even if they are not employed? I think this is a bit of a contradiction of your whole point.

What if everyone decides to become an artist? I'm fairly sure this wouldn't happen but you seem convinced that people need to be coerced into performing menial tasks or else nothing will get done.

How do you determine what's in the public's interest? What if nobody really wants what the artist is producing?

&gt; 2) People who do contribute back are usually finding a way to make a living too. They are just ashamed to be on welfare forever. The point is, not everybody is a highly motivated intellectual, there are slum families with several generations of bad socialization.

No, not everyone is an intellectual, but how can someone be if they are born into generations of poverty with no access to decent education, and they come to see that society has abandoned them to such conditions? I often wonder if the cure for cancer is toiling in a field somewhere, or if the person who could finally unite quantum theory with gravity is lying on the street, all because they never had the opportunities that wealthier people did, or if they made some mistakes in their lives there was little support for them. I don't think putting poor or resistant people to work in menial positions is going to help them or society very much.

How do you find jobs for the hundreds/thousands/millions of people who live in slums? A 100% employment rate is essentially impossible, especially if you take into account everyone in the world.

&gt; 3) To be perfectly honest, most jobs suck. It is understandable most people don't actually WANT to do them. I wouldn't. Yet, it is necessary.

I'm not sure if I agree that 'most jobs suck'. The tasks themselves might be quite interesting. For example, I like what I do on its own merit. However, the work itself is not all a job is; there is a lot of other shit that goes along with it. I think (although I do not have a study to cite, I remember most of this is true) that people find the following undesireable:

* Being pigeon-holed into one role that they are expected to perform almost every day.
* Having to spend most of their time working while trying to juggle other interests, family duties etc.
* Not having control over their work, what they produce and how it is used.
* Corporate structure (which is usually a private, totalitarian dictatorship).
* Lack of recognition.
* Despite the proliferation of automation, those of us in the West especially are expected to work longer and harder for stagnating wages.

I would challenge your assertion that 'it is necessary'. What makes it necessary? I'm not sure it's necessary for someone to carry my food from a kitchen restaurant to my table, for example. Just because a job exists doesn't mean it actually contributes anything meaningful or necessary to humanity. On the contrary, many jobs are largely useless or even detrimental. Our obsession with making people work merely for the sake of it leads to the existence of millions of these jobs. I obviously agree that some work is necessary to keep our species afloat (for example, food production); that doesn't mean all work is, nor does it mean I think it's right to continue our system of forced work as it exists today. If anything, should we not try to use automation to liberate ourselves from as much work as possible?

&gt; That is one of the purposes. There are many others. One is that given that the state has no independent income but gets money from taxes it acts as an intermediary between taxpayers and tax receipients, and thus its job is to ensure a balance of fairness and justice to BOTH.

Yes, I have a rudimentary understanding of 'taxes in, expenditure out'. 

&gt; It cannot just indefinitely take from one side and give to another side, some balance must be struck.

Why not? If people want to work, let them. If others don't want to work, so what? Even if everyone has the basics to live provided by the state, I reckon the majority of people will still seek jobs to supplement their lifestyles (Finland and, until recently, Ireland are good examples).

&gt; Tax receipients must put out a credible effort to do something of value in return - not necessarily normal jobs, but SOMETHING.

Again, this is really just an assertion. Why must they do 'something'? How do you define 'something'? How do you know they don't do 'something' already? 'But look at the slums!' isn't an argument. This line of reasoning also assumes that employment is equivalent to contribution, which is demonstrably false.

&gt; It is not a moral argument to bribe people to not commit crimes. This a punishment/reward thing. Crime deserves punishment, it is not like not committing crimes deserves a reward.

Okay. Not sure what you're getting at here. If you mean you want to reward people for working and punish them for not working, I think you probably have to first demonstrate why you think not working is equivalent to a crime and that the detriment to people's wellbeing is less than it would be without this reward/punishment system in place.

&gt; I think you see a pattern here - I openly admit that a centre-right, conservative view is a bit moralistic. I think the pragmatic view of the centre-left that tends to avoid moralizing is caustic and dangerous in the long run.

I don't mind moralising. You can't escape morality when trying to make any decisions on how society should be structured. Yes, I think some of the left (mostly the centre-left) are too afraid to make moral judgments. Luckily, I am not on the centre-left and am perfectly happy to assert morality. The problem is, while I think your heart is in the right place, your solutions are morally questionable. You are so concerned with working (and I'm not even sure where this idea comes from; perhaps the Bible is responsible for this conservative tradition) that you are willing to force people into it. You speak of justice for the taxpayer; well, for one, everyone pays taxes, but you're only really concerned about one part of society: those in employment.

However, I don't blame you. I think this is just a symptom of an economic system based on money. Capitalism leads us to a situation where we all assume that coerced work is necessary for our wellbeing and none of us stop to ask 'what evidence is there of this?'

&gt; The philosophy is: a good society happens only when incentive structures are set up so that people want to do good things and not want to do bad things. So we don't reward not committing crimes.

Yes, I think I agree with you. However, you are just imposing an artificial incentive on people: the incentive to avoid being punished, where that punishment comes in the form of starvation. This only serves to suppress humanity's innate desire for contributing to the world. We do it for myriad reasons, such as recognition, helping others, curiosity, the thrill of learning and scientific advancement, getting our hands dirty, a feeling of self-worth etc.

&gt; Who cares what you like? Do what you like from your own money. It is NOT the job of the state to ensure your well-being if you refuse to contribute back to the state because then you just leave that bill to be picked up by someone else. The state has no money on its own, only taxpayers have and this philosophy is literally equivalent to going to a well-off family and asking them to support you because you don't feel like working. This is hugely immoral.

No, it's nothing like that. The state isn't some kind of private club which only looks after those it deems worthy. You love going on about 'justice, justice, justice' but you completely ignore the inherent injustice of our socio-economic system. If the state must exist, then it must ensure that everyone can live. It's kind of funny that not much later on, you say that 'well of course there will be some inequality!', while at the same time complaining about the unequal burden placed on people who earn money.

&gt; EVERYBODY hates most of the jobs. Hello! Is this something new? Who the hell likes to clean or be a waiter or drive a truck? People do it because it is necessary.

I think you'll find a number of people who like to wait on tables or drive for a living. Do you really think being a waiter is necessary? Are people utterly incapable of carrying their own food? This is obviously not the case.

&gt; Grow up.

I'm probably older than you.

&gt; Life is not about doing what you like - not for most people who are not independently wealthy. It is mostly about making compromises.

No, life isn't about doing what you like, but I reckon it should be; society and technology have a chance to give us all the opportunity to live how we choose and pursue our passions. We only get one fleeting existence that is extinguished in the blink of an eye.

&gt; Dignity has nothing to do with what people think. Look at a drunk homeless who is lying a pool of piss - he can be entirely happy about it yet it is no dignity.

Dignity has *everything* to do with what people think. There is no inherent dignity to anything. It's a social concept that depends entirely on someone's point of view.",0,1400065032,null,0,false,0,chhmzwd,t3_25fyjg,t1_chhmzwd,t1_chhldrd,null,1433790583,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
true,yawnz0r,ANAR,Anarchy (Irish by birth),"&gt; Go to a slum and look around. Not the disadvantaged or poor but for the slum-dwellers who had generations of bad socialization. ""poor"" is a shitty metric. It is just income. And two people with the same low income can have vastly different attitudes at life. 

I'm not sure how your solution of forcing them into jobs that you've magicked out of thin air for the sake of it is going to help.

I think I'm just repeating myself at this stage. This is exhausting.

&gt; I don't feel any angst - I feel like I am being a staunch, reasonable moderate. I know a lot of people who got a lot more to the right. Basically middle-class Europeans are not overpopulated compared to the rest of the world, actually births are under the reproduction rate, and I don't think just because some people in in poor countries reproduce too much we cannot have at least a reproduction rate in order to preserve our ethnic cultures and our place in the world.

You're failing to see the full picture, which I can't help but notice is a trend among the right and conservatives. There is only one human species and we only have one planet. Our limited resources don't really care how many people live in Europe compared with India, nor do the looming disasters from global climate change.

&gt; I think your problem is that you see the smallest kind of inequality, even when symbolic and not pragmatic, as oppression.

No and this is trivial to demonstrate.

Let's say Christians aren't allowed to get married in some officially atheist country. After decades of campaigning, the state finally relents and says: 'Christians of Shitlandia, we have decided to create a new, special category of civil partnership for you!' 'What is civil partnership?' 'Well, it's not really marriage... for example, there are certain rights you do not have. You can not adopt children. There are 200 other things married couples can do that you can not.' 'That's not good enough.' 'Too bad. We're still better than you.'

While they're not being beaten and disappeared in the middle of the night, I don't think it's much of a stretch to call this oppression. It is a clear violation of freedom of religion. In fact, homophobic laws are arguably worse as your religion is a mostly a choice whereas your sexuality is not.

&gt; And because every culture is based on some form of inequality as equality literally means not having a culture - as a culture means that some things a preferred over some other things

I don't think you understand what equality is. Equality doesn't mean everyone's the same, it means nobody can wield power above anyone else, unless the arrangement is truly voluntary. Disagreeing with your friend over their preference for chocolate ice-cream doesn't mean inequality and your conflation of inequality with culture is just mental.

&gt; It is called compromise and a respect for the culture and views of others.

Yes, I know what it's called. The problem here is that some cultures and views are just ridiculous and aren't worthy of respect. It's a little ironic that you were giving out about the centre-left being afraid to moralise, no? If someone says that women shouldn't be allowed out of the house without a male escort, no rational, sane person with a sense of morality would respond with 'I respect that'.

I often find myself in this situation, where it is almost impossible to make progress in a discussion because our views of society are very different and we both hold many assumptions. After all, I am an anarchist and you are a moderate right-winger. I get the impression that you find it difficult to conceive of a more equal society that is based on a moneyless gift economy and not on forced work. If you would rather abandon this discussion I won't argue. I don't think I'm capable of tackling this further.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  I think this is a bit of a contradiction of your whole point.

No, my whole point was public works.

&gt;What if everyone decides to become an artist?

Committees judge quality worthy of support.

&gt;No, not everyone is an intellectual, but how can someone be if they are born into generations of poverty with no access to decent education, and they come to see that society has abandoned them to such conditions?

That is what public works helps: having that on the CV is better than having nothing on a CV. A recommendation letter sets one on path to better employment. 

&gt; I don't think putting poor or resistant people to work in menial positions is going to help them or society very much.

You cannot set people with generations of bad socialization directly to be professors, there is a path to be walked from public works to unskilled work, to skilled work, then college in the next generation.

&gt;How do you find jobs for the hundreds/thousands/millions of people who live in slums? 

Don't, hence, public works. On the job market not possible. If the state pays anway it may expect something in return.

&gt;For example, I like what I do on its own merit.

Ever tried cleaning 40 hotel rooms a day?

&gt;I would challenge your assertion that 'it is necessary'. What makes it necessary? 

The whole structure. Not the physical necessity, but more like if some people earn money without working then nobody will do the shit jobs - the majority of them. 

&gt; If anything, should we not try to use automation to liberate ourselves from as much work as possible?

Doubtful. I know intellectual people who would use free time well. I know also people who would just watch more TV and drink more booze. Which one is more frequent?

&gt; I reckon the majority of people will still seek jobs to supplement their lifestyles

I too, but even a minority is enough to make everybody feel unfair that they have to toil for something others just get.

One bad apple... and so on.

&gt;Again, this is really just an assertion. 

It is. So what? I am merely reflecting what many taxpayers feel. ""those damn parasites"" etc. etc. I want to put and end to these feelings and restore harmony.

&gt;If you mean you want to reward people for working and punish them for not working

No. I mean that you said no income leads to bad consequences. I thought you mean stealing is the bad consequence.

&gt;This only serves to suppress humanity's innate desire for contributing to the world.

LOL!!!!! I think I should stop this discussion here and now. You are incredibly naive, young, or live in some bubble. Seriously go to a slum, come here to Eastern Europe or do something but it is crazy. Humanity has an innate desire for fucking, fighting, feasting, showing off the bling-bling, and trying to be the biggest pimp on the block who can't be dissed because uppercuts the fuck out of everybody. There is a certain innate empathy but that is clearly in-group: don't mess with my tribe bro. Not universal.

Everything else is education and civilization, not innate. It should be CLEAR. What the fucking Lord of the  Flies or something.  Man is a vile animal under the skin of civilization. Universal compassion is LEARNED - even today, we keep learning, for example we are right about now try to learn compassion for transsexual people.

&gt;The state isn't some kind of private club which only looks after those it deems worthy.

The state in a way does not exist. It is the taxpayer. Basically if everybody would refuse to pay taxes there would be no state.

&gt; If the state must exist, then it must ensure that everyone can live.

Unconditionally? Not like do this, this and this and with that you deserve a living?



&gt; You love going on about 'justice, justice, justice' but you completely ignore the inherent injustice of our socio-economic system.

You mean employment-based capitalism where people cannot just go homesteading? There is some truth in that... but as long as people who are themselves employees and wage slaves get taxed it is a weak argument. You would have a strong argument if taxes would be about redistribution only - but in reality even the poor pay them.

&gt; It's kind of funny that not much later on, you say that 'well of course there will be some inequality!', while at the same time complaining about the unequal burden placed on people who earn money.

I am complaining about that this burden is UNCONDITIONAL - that they cannot have a say in how the people who get it should spend it.


&gt; Do you really think being a waiter is necessary? Are people utterly incapable of carrying their own food?

Now I am confused. Why should it be necessary to exist? It simply exists because people LIKE to be waited on and thus willing to pay money for it. Waiters live from that money. Serve other people's likes, earn a living.

&gt;how we choose and pursue our passions

Again grow up, get real, get out of your bubble. Intellectuals have passions. Many, many people have no passions - drink, watch TV and wait for their next shift at work.

Heck I am a sort of an intellectual and have no passions either. I am just coping with work and family.

Do you have passions? How did you get them? I never really had put effort into anything that was not necessary, that I was not compelled by a pressing need.

Seriously how many people you know who had them? Everybody I know has work/study/chores and then just leasure, games, TV etc.",0,1400066140,null,0,false,0,chhn7kf,t3_25fyjg,t1_chhn7kf,t1_chhmzwd,null,1433790684,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

En termes de contenu, l'effet Wikipedia est inquiétant : si ce n'est pas mentionné sur la page Wiki, ce ne sera jamais abordé. Il manque souvent, dans le travail qui mène à la rédaction d'un article, un moment de cadrage : qui/quoi dois-je consulter pour être sûr d'avoir couvert tous les aspects essentiels ? Wikipedia répond à cette question désormais (par manque de temps, de moyens, ou flemme), alors que beaucoup d'articles partent mal juste parce qu'ils ont oublié de mentionner ou de rencontrer telle structure/personne. C'est un peu cliché, mais la sérendipité a son rôle à jouer, et en allant au plus vite, il y a moins d'occasion de récolter des éléments inattendus.

Seems to me like online banking involves a host of security measures that simply can not be reproduced in online voting. Your vote is supposed to be anonymous after all, so any e-voting process must do its best to anonymize what you just voted. But every step of anonymizing also removes a measure that can be used to detect and trace back any manipulation. 

Eg, if I use online banking, I use a username and password that is unique to me. My IP address, location and the time of my transactions are logged. If someone hacks my account and transfers money away from it, I can immediately see it on my account when I log in myself the next time - if someone steals your vote, you will never know. If I see that my bank account has been hacked I can alert the bank, and they have such an array of data about me that they can confirm me as the actual owner of the account, give me a new password and lock out the intruder. To some extent, they could also use the data they have on me to verify/trace back what payments were dodgy, and should be reversed. And so on.

It's easy for European nations that don't trade with Russia, don't have a insanely long border with Russia to preach sanctions and NATO membership. We are in a completely different situation. And this is yet another reason why the Nordics should leave the EU and found a Nordic Union as on simple things as this we're already miles away from each other.

The Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves said it well yesterday during his visit to Finland: It is ironic how they who are far removed from Russia are the ones screaming the loudest for sanctions etc. 

And I completely agree with him.

&gt;why would they be upset at you joining NATO?

What the British are criticizing:

1. The betrayal over sovereignty by our own government in 1971 (documents exist verifying this) that continues to this day = Federal USE are decades of lying about this.
2. The betrayal over democracy by our own government and the EU eg the EU Constitution and other referendums ignored in other countries (Holland, France, Ireland) and other Treaties as well as the lies over referendums by our own governments.
3. The failure of prosperity of the EURO CRISIS and the Pro-EU agitators unaccountable for their failure and the misery inflicted on the GIIPS and elsewhere.
4. The failure of peace of the EU Empire with the escalation of Ukraine as final proof that the EU lies about bringing peace to the continent (See Yogoslavia) as an excuse for failing 1.-3. above.
5. The waste of political capital and the divisiveness and indecision, delays and disagreements of foreign unelected unaccountable eurocrats.

&gt;Or you could always just act as a private election observer an watch as the ballots are counted.

That's great. Now you know you counted the votes correctly and maybe even the rest of your fellows did.

How about the remaining 99% of the process?

At some point you give up control over these (your) results. You can mail them in to a central counting place, where they get added up, you could upload them for transparency, you can announce the winner truthfully according to the votes you counted and trust everyone else to be as honest as you, etc.

No matter where you are in the chain, you cannot trust the rest of the system that the communication is secure (that what you send is what gets received), that the process in the following steps is secure, that the result that comes out gets truthfully applied and so on and so on.

This wouldn't even be that hard. The higher up the chain it goes the easier it is to bribe someone to manipulate the vote for you or to have someone installed on your behalf that you can trust to manipulate the vote in your favor.

What are you going to do about it? Are you going to sit down and count everything all over again? By yourself? Who'd help you?

**Why should anyone else trust you and the people that help you when you doubt the result and (almost) everyone else doesn't?**

This is why anyone claiming voter fraud in any country might or might not be telling the truth. It doesn't matter if the result is that there are reelections until the result fits the desired outcome.

Elections are decided by the majority of the people (or ""independent"" observers) being ""ok"" with the result, so much so that there won't be a revolution. As long as that holds, you have no chance to challenge the result of any election.

The truth is the UK economy is well positioned to take advantage of the upturn in the global economy. 

I will mention here the Aerospace which rides the worldwide commercial fleet expansion and implicitly the huge demand for engines and parts. 

The financial sector is in full expansion everywhere and London takes advantage of it.

Similarly, the biotechnology and the oil and gas are in a global growth phase.

The reason I am making this argument is because people will jump on the alleged QE causation and blame Euro for their poor economy. The UK had QE, but at the same time it had austerity, and more important, it had the required foundations to ride the global growth.

The problem seems to be coming from the middle man management aka officials manning those computers which also made me think about the legitimacy of this report.

1. They claim they did stuff in local environment, like try out different attacks. However, it's just talk with no proof. They do not detail out all the details. If this was supposed to inform the public, I can not make a good decision on this little info if this really is unsafe as they make it out to be.  
2. Out of context pictures and problems. One example on this is one of the officials (there's a picture on the site) of an official [downloading](https://estoniaevoting.org/photos/opsec-download/) a program over HTTP (and not HTTPS) to edit files. What files? What did the official actually do at the moment on that screen? Maybe he was showing off where to download the program from? And what program? Yes, the picture does show Notepad2 download, but again what is the context behind this?  
3. [Revealing PIN](https://estoniaevoting.org/photos/opsec-pin/) on full view of the camera. I do not know what to specifically think of this, but I presume any and all officials were made aware of there being observers documenting everything. And while this was not a proper security audit, it's also why I presume the officials were relaxed on that department. **However**, because of the bad quality picture, it's actually very hard to tell what the official is typing there. For all we would know, it could be some random statistics.  
4. [Apparent WiFi password leak.](https://estoniaevoting.org/photos/opsec-wifi/) Poor picture quality make's it near impossible to tell if that is WiFi login details there or random message of the day.  
5. Even the USB picture showed there is bad quality to tell us the full picture. Could have been a random personal USB stick or sysadmin had his tools there, etc.  
6. I am also suspecting that was a secured room, where no random idiot can just waltz in.  
7. These were local elections, not nation wide. The report details as the whole system (regardless the type of elections held) are at security risk.  
8. It actually seems the risks (if these are true) is not on the machine system, but that of the humans. Yes, that is true that if you are handling sensitive data, no programs like PokerStars should be in there. However, this was again local municipality voting, not nation wide thing so maybe it was that location that was just full of security risks? Maybe this whole thing was done over some kind of remote terminal (although the server sat right there, so I doubt it)?

And finally, what about the lack of final report being sent to VVK (the voting commission)? While the research team has already made a statement back on the first VVK statement (which basically is calling them out), they didn't even touch that subject at all. What about the timing of all this? Or that the opposition party had some sort of hand in helping these researchers/observers? Until further details come out of all this (not after EU Parliment elections though, these guys don't want to disclose anything until then), this is just instilling fear, concern and possible false information.

Do not get me wrong that what these guys did was completely wrong. I am just not taking it at face value at the moment. I appreciate that something like this was done and that some problems, like the apparent root password for server leaked and building the client for distribution (which I did not touch above repentantly, but they still fall under Nr.1, 2 and 6). For all we would know, some stuff showed there were specifically demoed to the observers. But until concrete evidence is shown to the public, I am taking this with a grain of salt.

Edit1: Also to add, the observations were mostly based on what was happening inside that room and some lab testing. No details (besides talk) have been given about the process between the voter, the software and the server/place the votes go/software talks to).",0,1400072067,null,0,1400072248,0,chhone5,t3_25h6nh,t1_chhone5,t1_chhnp3t,null,1433791363,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Conoscete persone che sono già qui, e vi assisteranno in qualche modo, o che avrete modo di incontrare?

Come pensate siano visti i vostri connazionali in Italia?

Cosa pensate degli italiani? Sono volgari? Sono rumorosi? Scherzano sempre? Non hanno voglia di lavorare? Suonano tutti il mandolino? Se ci sono ragazze tra voi, vi siete mai preoccupate che i ragazzi italiani possano essere ""invadenti"" (aggressivi, che non sanno riconoscere un ""no"", ecc)?

Secondo voi gli italiani sono di mentalità più aperta o più chiusa rispetto ai cinesi?

Anche in Cina ci sono ""campanilismi"" (=persone di una città/regione che si sentono superiori a persone di altre città/regioni)?

Siete religiosi? Che religione praticate? Secondo voi come la pensano gli italiani sulla vs religione (o mancanza di)?

The county then hands in the tally to the state commission. If the state manipulates the tally, they won't match the county results. The state reports to the country commission. Again, if the country commission manipulates the tally, they won't match the state results.

That way you leave a very big audit trail, with the results going through many hands, who each can check that their results were entered correctly.

In the end, you can sit down and manually tabulate the published results of each county, because those would be the most difficult of all to manipulate (bribe hundreds of county officials country-wide). If the tabulated votes and the country commission's published results don't match, you would have enough material to raise the hue and cry.

&gt; This wouldn't even be that hard. The higher up the chain it goes the easier it is to bribe someone to manipulate the vote for you or to have someone installed on your behalf that you can trust to manipulate the vote in your favor.

But it's not like precinct reports remain secret and the only publication of results takes place at the central, national level. In most countries, each municipality tallies up its local results and publishes those, autonomously from any national authority, including the exact results for each individual precinct. 

Hence, if you only bribe the guys at the national election council who tally and publish the national results, the falsification will become apparent very quickly. To significantly change the national results, you'd still have to bribe people in a whole bunch of the major municipalities, which involves significant cost and effort.

&gt;What are you going to do about it? Are you going to sit down and count everything all over again? By yourself? Who'd help you?

Well, at least in the US, many of the state election procedures include stipulations for an automatic recount if the margin is below a certain margin and/or the ability for candidates to request a free recount if the result is below a certain margin, and/or the ability for candidates to request a recount at their own costs.

Ich habe nicht mich als Vorbild, aber folge einem Ideal ergebnis- und problemlösungsorientierter Diskussion. Wie erwähnt, bin ich sachlich darauf eingegangen, dass die mangelnde Begründung der Entscheidung in einem ersten Schritt nicht überzeugend ist und man da (auch im Sinne einer idealen Diskussionskultur) mehr erwarten sollte.

Dabei habe ich in einem zweiten Schritt auch deutlich gemacht, dass ich kein Sympathisant der CDU bin, ich mich aber dagegen verwehre, die gesamte Partei als demokratiefeindlich zu bezeichnen. Das hat unterschiedliche Gründe: Einer wäre, dass es damit anfängt, was den Demokratiefeindlichkeit überhaupt ist und falls ja ob die gesamte Partei demokratiefeindlich ist und es nicht nur in der Führung Entscheidungen und Tendenzen gibt, die als anti-demokratisch zu bezeichnen wären.

Wenn man sich auf eine differenziertere Betrachtung einlässt, wird man schnell feststellen, dass eine Aussage wie ""Die CDU ist eine demokratiefeindliche Partei"" nicht haltbar sind.

&gt;*Here’s a classic example of how the metropolitan elite gets it wrong every darned time. The latest immigration figures show that there are currently 144,000 Bulgarians and Romanians working in the UK – a rise of 26 per cent since 2013 and 44 per cent since 2012. “Ah, but,” says the aristocracy of Notting Hill, “the number actually fell after work restrictions were lifted in January. And didn’t Nigel Farage say that we’d be swamped with migrants in the New Year?”*

&gt;*A word about the figures. First, the number of Bulgarians and Romanians might be down 4,000 since January but they are up 29,000 compared with a year ago. Second, we’re talking about net migration, so while some people will have left the country since the New Year, many new may have arrived – which means that the small overall fall might disguise fresh arrivals. Third, the work restrictions were lifted in all EU countries – so it’s likely that many Bulgarians and Romanians have chosen to work in other nations rather than our own (but may come here eventually). Finally, the number that really matters in the report is the one that shows there are now an astonishing 4.5 million non-UK workers here in Britain. That represents a 7 per cent increase year-on-year.*

Secondly, if you encourage moving in with parents - all parents may not be willing, parents have their own set of (often conservative) rules, etc. Plenty of people don't have parents, or their parents live in different countries where employment may be an issue.

Starting a company -- without a powerful concept, guaranteed or likely customer base, a fair amount of starting capital (more than what a poor, unemployed person can put in), as well as a number of useful contacts -- will result in a failure 90% of the time.

Je réponds à ta première question sur les annonceurs.

J'ai travaillé majoritairement sur les pages « culture », du coup la question de la relation aux annonceurs se posait différemment. La culture était rentable, grâce aux « partenariats ». Concrètement, l'organisateur de festival venait voir le journal, achetait un certain nombre d'articles sur son festival, et en échange on couvrait l'événement, en amont, pendant, en aval. Une fois s'est posée la question de faire un article critique envers un partenaire de ce type. La solution était de réserver aux pages « Culture » les articles payés, et de confier à d'autres rédacteurs et d'autres pages les articles critiques.

Mais c'est sûr qu'il y avait une pression particulière sur ces articles-là... (c'est-à-dire que pour une fois le patron lisait la page culture).

Par contre on m'a raconté une aventure avec un annonceur : une journaliste (qui est désormais dans la communication) m'a raconté avoir dû feinter avec le « pilote » (le type qui donne le feu vert aux articles) ce jour-là pour passer une information sur des salariés en grèves dans un supermarché qui était aussi un gros annonceur du journal. Elle est allée couvrir la grève, en mettant en avant le point de vue des grévistes, et a attendu que le pilote rentre chez lui (un peu avant 22 h, le bouclage étant à minuit) et s'est pointée avec l'article. Le secrétaire de rédaction (désormais le seul dans les murs à pouvoir décider du contenu du journal) a monté la page, et ils ont perdu un mois d'annonces le lendemain. 

Le plus intéressant dans cet exemple est que si le pilote avait été là, il aurait vu la possibilité de perdre un mois d'annonce en rétorsion, et aurait dit « je ne peux pas prendre cette décision sans en référer au-dessus. Je me renseigne et on passe l'article demain si c'est bon ». Or, attendre 24h, c'est réduire l'intérêt de l'article, et donc réduire sa taille, et donc réduire son impact etc. De la censure douce.",0,1400076152,null,0,false,0,chhq1js,t3_25j137,t1_chhq1js,t1_chhnt4v,null,1433792042,7,false,france,t5_2qhjz,7

Then consider this: how many times have you seen gay men being sexual in your entire life?

Again, sit there and count the times. You'll only need one hand I'm sure ;)

So when you go your whole life being told ""This thing you never actually see is the most disgusting thing ever"" of course your knee jerk reaction to recoil.

I problemi di frammentazione non esistono è una favola che ripete chi viene dal monolite della mela, dove erano abituati a fare le interfacce con photoshop e appiccicarle come una immagine su uno schermo di grandezza fissa. Quando hanno ingrandito la ""grandezza perfetta"" del primo cellulare, le vecchie applicazioni mostravano le barre nere perchè altrimenti si spaccava tutto. Hanno dovuto cacciare il creatore di ios per riuscire a sistemare la rigidità e il vecchiume di quella piattaforma. 

Anzi vale proprio il contrario, a questo punto è ios che è frammentato, se fai una applicazione per android funziona su qualsiasi tipo di hardware, incluso schermi di dimensioni diverse come tablet, dove puoi anche aggiungere interfacce diverse con minimo sforzo. Sviluppi un unico programma e funziona ovunque, retrocompatibile, multipiattaforma e futureproof (il futuro è multiscreen). Su ios devi sempre avere versioni apposta per ipad e iphone stando attento anche alle due diverse ""misure perfette"" ( e probabilmente alla prossima misura perfetta visto che ingrandiranno ancora l'iphone) , senza contare che apple in qualsiasi momento può fare un aggiornamento che ti costringe a risistemare l'applicazione che altrimenti non funziona più, o ti può addirittura bloccare completamente l'applicazione, mandando a quel paese tutta la tua azienda.

Seguire questo modo di fare tecnologia con il monopolismo assoluto della apple è semplicemente stupido. 

L'hype lo fa proprio chi mette l'ipad first and foremost, fa rabbrividire il fatto che lo vogliono introdurre nelle scuole.

My criticism back then was that if you just went into some random mid-priced restaurant or shop (especially for lunch), the food often sucked.  I pretty much ate at Pret or a kebab place.  Though there was a really good french sandwich shop on Regents Street, which is now a Starbucks.

I'm sure it could have totally changed by now.  In 1998 in the US, our beers SUCKED (with the exception of Sierra Nevada and Sam Adams).  Yes, we had Sam Adams Boston Lager here in NYC, but otherwise it was literal pisswater.  Now, even if you got into a shitty dive bar, there are going to have at least 2-3 local craft brews available, and if you go into a regular bar, probably 5, and a nice bar 12, and a ""beer  bar"" they can have 40 craft beers, and some have way more than that.  

And you can drink at the brewery as well, here is my favorite local, they have won gold medals at many competitions: http://www.peekskillbrewery.com/tap-room-2/house-beers/

Un réel questionnement, j'irai pas jusque là. Quand je suis arrivé, les journalistes étaient contraints et forcés de suivre des formations « multimédias » (en gros, savoir se servir de l'appareil photo et de sa fonction vidéo, d'apprendre le montage, pour pouvoir faire des vidéos en plus des articles habituels). Mais ça, c'était fin des années 2000... 

La gestion du web était assez désastreuse. Même aujourd'hui, ils ont des pratiques absurdes (c'est un journal homothétique, identique à la version papier – jusqu'au format des photos ! Je parle même pas du moteur de recherche). Apparemment, l'aspect web est géré en dehors du journal, par le cousin du beau-frère de... la raison habituelle pour expliquer des niveaux d'incompétence assez élevés.

La baisse des ventes est constante, et n'est pas imputée au web (les visites sont assez peu nombreuses). La question web n'intervenait en salle de rédaction que dans la mesure où ça permettait d'avoir des articles plus longs que sur papier. Après, il y a eu des contraintes venues d'en haut, et les journalistes étaient de plus en plus encouragés à faire des vidéos à destination du web. Globalement, le rapport au web a toujours été le même : c'est un élément accessoire, et on incite la rédaction à produire un contenu spécifique – sans prévoir de réels outils, formations ou rémunérations.",0,1400076943,null,0,false,0,chhqcjt,t3_25j137,t1_chhqcjt,t1_chhnt4v,null,1433792177,4,false,france,t5_2qhjz,4

Diese besagt, dass die GEMA vermutlich die Rechte aller Künstler an der Aufführung oder Wiedergabe aller Musiktitel inne hat. Sofern man nicht nachweisen kann, dass ein Künstler nicht GEMA Mitglied ist, muss man Abgaben bezahlen. 

Das führt mitunter zu sehr komplizierten Situationen, wo Künstler ihre eigenen Videos nicht bei YouTube einstellen können, oder ihre eigene Musik nicht als kostenloses MP3 über ihre Homepage zum Download stellen dürfen - beziehungsweise dafür Geld an die GEMA bezahlen müssen, welches sie später theoretisch wieder zurück erhalten müssten. Aber das Ausschüttungsverfahren ist noch komplizierter und intransparent.

Jedenfalls müsste Google für jedes Musikstück auf YouTube für jedes Abspielen Geld and die GEMA zahlen, weil diese _vermutlich_ den Urheber vertritt. Den Preis den Google pro Abspielen zahlen wollte, war der GEMA zu wenig (oder umgekehrt) und deshalb werden jetzt gar keine Musikstücke mehr gezeigt. Auch solche, wo die GEMA überhaupt keine Vertretung für den Künstler übernimmt.

Ja, die GEMA hat Verträge mit anderen Verwertungsgesellschaften aber längst nicht mit allen. Und es gibt auch viele Künstler, die nicht bei der GEMA gemeldet sind, für die diese aber trotzdem Geld einfordert.  Einer der bekanntesten Fälle dieses Irrsinns hat mit einem Pseudonym zu tun, welches ein Künstler verwendet hat um einen Song auf einem CC Sampler der Piratenpartei beizusteuern. Der war nicht bei der GEMA gemeldet, hat der GEMA deshalb auch nicht sein Pseudonym mitgeteilt, trotzdem bekam die GEMA vor Gericht recht. Die Vermutung galt da irgendwie mehr, als die Tatsache.

&gt;Forcing somebody to find a partner is also stupid; women don't exist solely to be married off. 

You seriously don't understand that what happens with women and men is less important than what happens to children. Basically once you have kids you are enslaved to them. Their concerns override yours.

Women don't exist to be married off as long as they don't have children. Once they do the primary DUTY is to provide a decent family for the  child. So it is the DUTY of the single parent, to override romantic or other considerations, and find a decent foster dad and move in, and I would say the same thing for the rarer case of single dads as well: stop chasing pretty girls, you have a DUTY now more important than your own preferences, find a decent mommying type of woman to live with even when she is fat and older.

Seriously I think it is an entirely screwed up approach that people somehow deserve such a thing as fully autonomy once they have children. It is selfish and wrong.

For both men and women, having a child IS being the slave of the child. This is my view.

&gt;No male role model? What does that say about lesbians adopting children?

I don't know, that wasn't investigated a lot yet, just straight single parents.

&gt;women are so dependent on the family unit here, that they lack any autonomy at all. 

**How can a person who has children not be dependent, either man or woman?!** I mean it is precisely because the child is dependent they are full of duty.

Autonomy without kids is a basic human right. With kids there is no such thing as autonomy how can you think something like this? Again having kids is being a slave to kids - accept that or give up for adoption. 

Kids are naturally dependent on having a fully family environment and ever selfish person who thinks their autonomy is more important should just give them up for adoption.

Sorry, but I am kind of pissed off by now, my comment is a bit angry I guess. I never thought anybody could so selfish to say parents can have autonomy. We actually have a 2 month old. Should we just fuck off to a restaurant or a night out and leave the baby wailing in hunger just because our precious autonomy dictates that? In reality we have fully accepted that we will not have any entertainment for years old. Kids are a SACRIFICE dammit not a hobby. Is is suffering, not fun, this is why people are so proud of their kids - because it is such a hard earned thing. It is like giving your life to the life of another person.

I am just angry because of this selfishness. Everybody should accept that once they have kids their individual lives are over. Now they just exist as a life support and raising apparatus of their kids.

**People who value individual autonomy should never have kids. Kids are not a hobby, not a lifestyle statement, not something that just happens.

&gt;One of the reasons Norway is not in EU - and Norway actually has only two (one if we want to speak honestly) cities to build/invest into (unlike Russia) - not literally but you get my point

Makes me wonder which two cities you are talking about. In Sweden for example, it's quite easy to speak of 3 cities (Stockholm, Göteborg and Malmö) which are far bigger than the rest of the cities. 

In Norway on the other hand, it's more difficult. While Bergen is the second largest city after Oslo, Stavanger for example is not that much smaller in terms of the metropolitan area. 

And to ad to this, Stavanger is the centre for the Norwegian oil industry, which begs the question, can Norway afford not to invest their oil money heavily in their oil capital Stavanger.

He said, the picture taken from estoniaevoting.org (taken during September 2013 in a training session, not from some local election booth or something) was him being an independent observer testing the system out. The estoniaevoting.org site says he was an worker revealing PIN codes. PIN codes, that are unique to each ID Card each citizen of Estonia has and are useless without the actual ID Card itself. 

He also states that to use the system, a person needs the PIN code, the ID Card and to be at the right time at the right place to use the system.

That is completely incorrect. Maybe that accounts for a few in the Mediterranian, but hardly for the largest part of the refugees, for example not the million in Turkey you just referred to. And, you ignore that one can send them back, refuse *any* recidensy of people who do not enter legally etc- millions of options that doesn't include killing/letting people die. 

&gt; I personally, think it's better to accept them

Define a refugee, and how many, for each country, for how long are they going to stay etc....What is each country going to pay? If you do - shouldn't it be a democratic deciscion? Or are you just going to force the people in let us say Poland to accept two millions? Who sets the limits- you? Maybe Poland thinks 5000 is OK - but you think 1 million. Why are you right, and the person who think 5000 wrong? It is not like you have the answers, actually. 

&gt;There are a bunch of people who say 'no refugees' because they're selfish pieces of shit.

Excuse me, what sort of moral highground do you have? Are people from Syria refugees? And how many millions should we accept? Are you in no way understanding costs, and that actually how destructive large influxes of people can be and do not understand why people don't want that? What about people from Kosovo that want a better life, or people from Tunis, or Ethiopia? At what point does one start being ""a selfish piece of shit"" to you? How many percentages of GDP? How many refugees? 

I know there is no easy solution, nor do I claim to have it, but claiming (in particular since these are Mediterranian refugees) that even all of them a refugees (looking for work because your country is Tunis for example and have high unemployment) is hardly correct. If we go by the UN definition, 90 % are not, and should thus be sent home. Are you OK with that? If the UN says so then? What you are asking is wealth distribution and permanent payment and tax money to people who may and may not deserve it, and who might very well not be refugees. Just because you don't think that is OK, doesn't automatically makes people pieces of shit, just different opinion. 


I mean, I think it is a really difficult question, but most people who think it is brilliant to accept hundreds of thousands of refugees don't bother to deal with disruptive things like costs, crime, taxes, how if affects society etc. I mean, if you want that, how will you fix it? I think it is rather natural, and not evil to say no to things that one knows will affect the society one lives in, in a negative way. Why can't you see that?

&gt;Calculating the expense and generation of values to a country by ethnic groups are inherently impossible

We've had it done by Tullberg's ""Låsningen"", which is where the 7% number comes from and he's lowballing several points and of course there's the OECD's report that it was costing us -0.57% of our GDP prior to all the state costs like healthcare and pensions being accounted for so it's clearly not impossible.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"&gt;That is completely incorrect. Maybe that accounts for a few in the Mediterranian, but hardly for the largest part of the refugees, for example not the million in Turkey you just referred to. 

What are you talking about? Turkey accepted them. So yes, you can leave them to die, or you can accept them.

&gt;And, you ignore that one can send them back, refuse any recidensy of people who do not enter legally etc- millions of options that doesn't include killing/letting people die.

Under the UN convention on refugees, if they make it to your territory they have the right to request political asylum. During their application process, your country has to protect them. People are wrong when they frame this as 'illegal immigration'. I'm sure some are just economic migrants, but for example in Australia - where it's decidedly harder to get to than to Europe, over 90% of refugees that were caught on boats and detained were found to be **genuine refugees** and not economic migrants.

&gt;Define a refugee, and how many, for each country, for how long are they going to stay etc....What is each country going to pay? If you do - shouldn't it be a democratic deciscion? Or are you just going to force the people in let us say Poland to accept two millions? Who sets the limits- you? Maybe Poland thinks 5000 is OK - but you think 1 million. Why are you right, and the person who think 5000 wrong? It is not like you have the answers, actually.

I really shouldn't have to define refugee for you. And what do you mean a democratic decision? The people your society elected signed the UN convention on refugees. That was a democratic decision. Your parliamentarians chose to ratify it. I don't see the relevance.

As to the rest of what you wrote, it's a bunch of crap that I never claimed. There is already an international definition of refugee, I shouldn't have to explain to you the difference between refugee and illegal immigrant.

&gt;Why can't you see that?

Because your premise is flawed, and you're arguing against things I never claimed. If the entire population of China started a mass trek to Europe, then I'd say ""OK, there's no way we can support this"". When, and if, that happens, then we can talk about your fanciful scenarios. But that's not happening, the numbers that are coming are not so high that there'd even be a noticeable EU-wide drop in living standards, and there's no reason that they would have to be here as permanent, rather than temporary, refugees.

Well I happen to be a survivor of the Utøya massacre so I feel somewhat comfortable with not giving a fuck about what you think is tasteful.

The Norwegian press has overstated the distance between FrP and Breivik because they're too cowardly to actually look at how the Norwegian society got where we are. The ideological differences between him and high-standing elected officials of FrP are difficult to make out.

I frequently read the Economist and the NYT (Forbes less so) and I take anything from them with a very large pinch of salt. After all, all three papers were **utterly convinced** that there were Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq back in 2003...

In any case, Op/Eds in notoriously biddable papers are no substitute for serious, independent economic cost/benefit analyses of eventual independence. Of which there have been NONE so far, as far as I know. This is what I find most shocking about the whole campaign for independence so far: an utter refusal to prepare for, or even acknowledge, the negative economic, legal and social consequences of independence. Even a convinced secessionist ought to acknowledge that there are going to be at least some negative consequences and prepare for them.

À l'époque, la presse était dans les locaux, et apparemment, l'équipe qui s'occupait de la faire tourner tournait elle-même au vin. C'était une drôle d'ambiance, selon les heures, et selon qui tu pouvais croiser dans les couloirs. 

Il m'a raconté une histoire d'espionnage : quand les presses ont disparu, les deux journaux de la région, à l'époque toujours en concurrence, étaient imprimés au même endroit. Un jour, le journal A avait passé des heures, sans succès, à essayer d'obtenir des informations sur un gros fait divers ayant eu lieu dans la journée. En se renseignant, la rédaction de A apprend que le journal B a eu des infos et que leur article est prêt. Une petite heure avant le bouclage, le SR de A est désespéré : pas possible de paraître sans mettre un mot sur l'affaire – et portant, aucune info n'a filtré. Ça s'est réglé en passant un coup de fil à l'imprimeur, qui a été soudoyé avec la promesse d'un certain nombre de bouteilles, et qui a lu à la rédaction l'article écrit par le journal concurrent, alors qu'il était en train d'être imprimé.

Globalement, le journal c'est bien quand tu y crois, tu crois en ce que tu fais, t'es dans l'ambiance « les hommes du président » (ok, peut-être pas à ce niveau-là) – mais par moment j'avais ça, c'était chouette de courir après l'info, de la ficeler comme il faut, et de rendre tout ça à temps.

Le dégoût a plus à voir avec la découverte du monde du travail et ses petites bassesses quotidiennes qu'avec le journalisme en soi.  La différence de traitement selon que je me présentais comme correspondant ou simple étudiant était stupéfiante. A la réflexion ça va de soi, mais je n'étais pas habitué à avoir un pouvoir de nuisance (cela dit, le pouvoir de nuisance est tout relatif... la pire chose qu'un journaliste puisse vous faire est de ne pas parler de vous. Jamais il ne fera l'effort de parler mal de quelqu'un – ce serait se faire un ennemi, et il évite d'en avoir autant que vous).

It says the total assets are c. €20 bn and liabilities, c.€25 bn.

That looks pretty much full zombie to me and suggests the market cap of €9 bn, may be optimistic.

How about we put in a comprehensive system that allows immigrants to find work and a home, same as any national. Sweden does that well, even if people claim it discriminates against Swedish nationals. Helping them integrate is better than throwing them to the wolves, like you'd advocate.

Aswell as the Norwegians do, they must work to gain social welfare. Becoming a citizen should be top priority, not being a residential and reaping benefits without work.

&gt; What does that idiot have to do with this.

You advocate shooting refugee rafts, how do you think the international scence would treat you or Finland? You'd be seen as another Brevik, not 'doing the right thing'.

&gt; No personal insult there. You clearly said ""...So they never knew"". No one on this planet that knows about the fact that there is something called Europe is so ill-informed that they don't know that what they're doing is illegal.

If they did they wouldn't pay a shit ton of money for someone to take them there in the middle of the night on a boat that barely floats.

And yet you still know nothing. Spaniards see Scandinavia as a paradise where they can work freely and continue their lives. They go there, open up a cafe or so, but only to find the cultures there don't have the same. They end up stuck in a purgatory.

You clearly don't see my point, which is *misinformation and idealism* causing these people to die. They want a better life, but they'd soon realize they're either dead in the water or facing more problems than before.

Also, to quote [the Wikipedia article on Ernst Röhm, leader of the SA:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_R%C3%B6hm)

&gt;Hitler was aware of Röhm's homosexuality. At this point they were so close that they addressed each other as du (the German familiar form of ""you"").

Röhm was the only Nazi leader who dared to address Hitler by his first name ""Adolf"" rather than ""mein Führer.""


Some people argue that Hitler's later persecution of gays was a form of overcompensation for his own sexuality, and that's quite possible.

true,toresbe,NORW,Norway,"&gt; Why not just post la-la-la while you're at it?

Because that would be something different from what I'm doing, which is saying that no matter how many references you feel like digging up, I reject the notion that it is statistically possible to measure the effect a given ethnicity has on an economy.

When you do try, you end up going for the most easily quantifiable stuff. The cost to the government of the requirements immigrants have of education and other social services are transparent and obvious. So those always make it into the calculations. 

But what about the gains made by commerce by a more diverse labour market, making it possible for a company to easily hire someone who understands the business culture and language of an emerging export market? What about the general positive effects of companies having greater access to workers?

In Norway, similar attempts have been made to quantify the cost of immigration, with similarily ludicrous results, with even major newspapers printing the notion that immigration costs Norway more than we're making from oil. 

&gt; It's rather clear you don't understand the term bobo

That's a really funny sentence. :)

&gt; I have not actually said you couldn't have been on on the AUF summer camp, I said you're not working class

I dunno. I define myself as working-class, to the extent that a class-based analysis of people in the welfare state is possible. But I don't define myself by my class, and I don't think it's healthy to do so. We're all individuals, albeit shaped by our experiences.
