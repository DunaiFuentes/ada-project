I'm a bit flabbergasted here, I just assumed you meant wealthy Flanders pays more taxes because the people make more money, and that this money flows to poor people in Wallonia based on need.

We have nothing like this at all.  In the US, it is needs based, and is always in flux, and there is nothing formal.  To put it simply, when a state has a shitty economy, it pays less taxes because people make less money and/or are unemployed, and the state gets more money because people need unemployment and healthcare.   

This [Krugman Article](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/02/florida-versus-spain/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1) explains it in the context of the EU not helping Spain, but he puts a good analysis of how we helped our ""Spain,"" Florida.  The change in cashflow is automatic.  Some federal programs take the cost of living into effect with regards to benefits, but that is a relatively minor amount.

When I pay my federal taxes, it goes into the general fund, and then is distributed where it is needed.  So lets say a massive gold deposit is found in Mississippi, and it is a full fledged gold rush.  Even though the year before Mississippi is poor as hell, this year they are loaded and income goes up, and unemployment goes down.  So they go from getting  a lot of federal money to getting very little, and paying a lot more to the federal government in the form of income taxes.  This seems very fair to me.

So transfers in the American sense means money to poor people, either directly, or by funding state programs which are uniformly applied across the country, but may have adjustments for local costs of living.  

As for things netting to 0, taxes do not cover our expenses, we borrow massively.  So some of the money is coming from the sale of bonds.  We also have negative taxation for poor people, meaning they get money back from the government.  Those are the states on that chart that are below 0 contribution; folks there might pay $X a year in taxes, but upon filing, they will get all kinds of credits and benefits from the government, and will get a check for $X + $Y.

I can understand why the Flemish would be upset with the Belgian system.  It isn't like you are funding benefits directly to Walloonian individuals, or to Wallonian individuals via the Wallonian government, you are just giving money to the general fund of Wallonia.

I urge you to reread the article I sent for a better understanding of our system than I can give.

For instance, states like California and New York both receive 21% less federal dollars than they spend in federal taxes. A whopping 45% of New Jersey's federal taxes never return to the state. There is a very substantial internal wealth transfer within the US. I have posted in the past about how this could alleviate many of the problems with such disparate economies sharing the Euro. Obviously at the current time, a federalized EU taxation system would be next to impossible, but in the long run I truly think it would be beneficial. 

The difference becomes even more acute when looking at US territories. For instance 20-25% of Puerto Rico's economy is comprised of Federal transfers.

CERN exists because of the peace and prosperity that NATO and the EU create. 

The USSR is the reason Russia has a space program. They still use Soviet technology. 

USA's debt is irrelevant. No one doubts their ability to pay it back. They are the world's largest economy and have the global currency.

None of those countries have come anywhere near close to what the USA has achieved with its federal union. 

The United States went through a period when it was fairly decentralized. It used the Articles of Confederation instead of the U.S. Constitution. The Articles of Confederation were regarded as a failure and replaced with greater federalism. The Confederate States of America disputed federal authority in favour of ""states rights"" and lost. History arcs towards more federalism, not less, and Europe will be no exception. 

The funniest part of this to me is that Europeans think that they can resist federalism even though they have already passed the equivalent of the Articles of Confederation in the EU.

Americans with ancestors from Asia sometimes are seen as not American, especially when it comes to answering the question ""Where are you from?"". If an Asian-American replies to that question with an American place, sometimes there'll be the follow-up question [""Where are you *really* from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/asiantwoX/comments/xsrp7/the_where_are_you_really_from_question/), which betrays the assumption that Asian-Americans *have* to really be from somewhere else as parodied in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWynJkN5HbQ) where the white American won't accept the Asian-American's answer that she's from San Diego.

This seems to be a popular notion on Reddit. The entire world supported Saddam Hussein. Germany and France even built his factories he used to make chemical weapons. They were kind enough to continue supplying him with raw materials even after questions began to arise as to what they were being used for. 

France was his third largest weapons supplier, after China and Russia. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and ironically Kuwait were his largest financial backers. 

Reddit loves to bring this up, yet the US was *far* from his most important ally. Virtually the entire developed world supported Saddam Hussein. Even many US cold war foes supported him as well. Many countries offered far more material support than the US, and the US and UK are the two countries that set up and enforced the no-fly area over the Kurdish parts of Iraq.

true,RegisteringIsHard,null,null,"&gt; why there are still so many US army bases in Germany.

Late reply, but there was a fuck-ton of them to begin with. The overwhelming majority of them were army installations. During the peak, there was something crazy like 200 or more US army facilities in Germany, now there is just 40-50. Something like 10 or so are scheduled to be closed within the next few years. I'm not sure how accurate it is, but there's a big list of the army installations [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Army_installations_in_Germany).

As for why it takes so long to close them, a big part of the problem is the US Congress. IIRC, the US Congress doesn't want to discuss European base closures for fear that it could lead to base closures within the US (AKA: a loss of federal funding and jobs in the districts they represent). The US's House Armed Services Committee has been actively fighting the prospect of another BRAC (Base Realignment and Closure) commission for several years now.",0,1403680486,null,0,false,0,cigijkq,t3_28xpwe,t1_cigijkq,t1_cifn0ni,null,1434394001,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,vlepun,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; We have different capabilities, I believe we have to provide all the airborne radar, only we have aircraft carriers, so on and so forth. 

The first part is very true, but this stems from different views on force projection. The EU isn't particularly concerned with large scale military force projection. We generally use political and financial powers to do so. And in the case of military force projection we generally use elite troops with state of the art equipment. (It goes without saying that the newer EU members have some catching up to do here.)

The second part is just not true. EU has its own AWACS air planes, own air refuelling wing, own drone programme, and own (spy) satellite programme. 

The thing is, there are multiple ways to achieve what you want. You guys use big Carrier Battle Groups which are very impressive. We use land based air power, frigates that are armed like destroyers and extremely stealthy submarines to reach our goals. 

For example: The German and Italian navy have the worlds first diesel-electric, air independent powered submarines in service in the world, with a tested maximum depth of over 700m ([Type 212/214](http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/type_212/)). Because of where we have our air bases, we can project air power into our region without the use of big carriers. It's only when we go outside of our region (like in the case of Afghanistan) that we need carriers. For Iraq all EU-nation sorties were flown out of Italy, Greece or Turkey. No need for carriers there. 

Now, since the EU isn't interested in a 'World Police'-role like the US has, we don't care all that much for force projection outside of our own region. We are interested in peace and quiet in our own region and that's it. If you guys call, we'll usually answer, sometimes hesitantly, but we answer (look at Iraq and Afghanistan). But that doesn't mean we need the same capabilities. ",0,1403681032,null,0,false,0,cigio02,t3_28xpwe,t1_cigio02,t1_cifqn2l,null,1434394059,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Genaun das ist ein ziemlich heißes Eisen in einigen ""Veganerkreisen"". :) Nach meiner Auffassung (ich bin wahrlich kein Szenegänger und kann nur wiedergeben, was ich davon so verstehe und mitbekomme) gibt es da zwei große Kritikpunkte: einmal, dass man mit dem Kauf solcher Ersatzprodukte genau die Firmen, Konzerne und Strukturen unterstützt, die man als Veganer/in ablehnen sollte, weil sie unethisch handeln - das ist für mich persönlich der Grund, so etwas nicht gewohnheitsmäßig zu kaufen. Der großflächige, monokulturelle Anbau von Soja ist ja zum Beispiel ökologisch sehr problematisch, und alpro, nur um eine bekannte zu nennen, ist keine nach meinen Maßstäben ""gute"" Firma, nur weil sie vegane Produkte vertreibt.

Dann gibt es die eher philosophische Kritik, dass der Veganismus eine Alternative zu einer Weltverständnis, in dem Tiere Gebrauchsgegenstände sind, darstellen und diese herausfordern möchte/sollte/muss - wenn man nun aber vegane ""Leberwurst"" und ""Schnitzel"" etc isst, dann fordert man überhaupt nichts heraus, sondern versteckt sich hinter etablierten Begriffen und kuscht vor der Vorstellung, dass es keine Welt ohne Ausbeutung von Tieren geben kann. So heißt es. Ich persönlich sehe das nicht so. Ich denke, man kann morgens aufstehen und sagen: Hey, ich glaub, ich will keine tierischen Produkte mehr essen - und dann ist man Veganer/in. Man ""darf"" das so machen, man muss sich nicht an irgendeine Front stellen und seine Lebensmittel und Kleidungsstücke bis in letzte Molekül analysieren, weil sonst ist man ja überhaupt nicht konsequent und dann kannst Du auch gleich Schnitzel essen, blablabla. (was einem gerne von beiden Seiten vorgeworfen wird - manche Veganer/innen und manche Nicht-Veganer/innen sind geradezu versessen darauf, einem irgendeine Inkonsequenz ""nachzuweisen"" - warum eigetlich?)

Das sage ich als jemand, der sehr vegnüglich seine Lebensmittel und Kleidungsstücke bis aufs letzte Molkeül analysiert. Weil ich das so möchte und mir das ein gutes Gefühl gibt, aber diese Maßstäbe müssen doch keine Relevanz für irgendjemand anderen haben. Insofern - öh, sind wir uns glaub ich einig, mit dem Autor des Artikels nicht einig zu sein.

Well Spain did the first part while many countries didn't and then got punnished for trying to follow through with the whole cycle. A financial panic is not solved with public sector debt *tightening*, but due to everyone repeating the falsehood ad nauseum led to shaky market acceptance anyway and made it a public debt problem basically doubling the problem unnecessarily.

So now you have a financial panic and public debt crisis with no way to inject money into the economy because Germany controls the ECB and is so afraid of any inflation (that would benefit their exports) that they refuse to do any capital injections like what is necessary. Just look at how much the Fed put out and inflation in the US barely moved.

The currency problem is continuing as it is artificially strong for Spain hurting any exports and artificially weak for Germany helping theirs. The Germans also refuse to acknolwedge that this directly helps them at the direct expense of the weaker countries.

There are certainly corruption problems but that's really such a small amount in the grand scheme of things that it the proverbial drop in the bucket. Right now the biggest issues in Spain are the beaurocratic nightmare to open businesses which stifles innovation and the complete lack of English skills which are necessary to be a player in a global service economy, though Latin American growth helps in that regard even if it's not enough.

The other major reform that should happen in Spain (and across Europe) is changing mortgages to non-recourse loans for mortgages. I agree that there has to be some way to determine who stays in a home and money is probably the most fair. But if the bank takes your house, you should not be liable to keep paying even after they have the collateral whose entire purpose is to secure the debt in the first place. A mortgage should be a calculated bet by the bank and the borrower and the bank shouldn't be allowed to collect twice if it goes bad.

I could go on and on, but that's a good summary.

true,project_apex,NETH,Not Deutsch,"&gt; My province can elect a shitty government, but it cannot create a crisis because provinces do not have enough power to cause that much chaos. Independent states do. Federal oversight fixes this problem.

My province as well. They can't do shit because we have a national government. Look at the US. Why do you believe that a federal authority won't fuck up? Everyone knew this would happen. That is why in the Maastricht treaty we agreed to not have a deficit above 3%. 

And then France and Germany decided [in 2002](http://www.economist.com/node/2031381) that the rule didn't apply to them. And of course. Then the Greeks, Italians and Spanish said the same. The Italian EU commission president at the the time, Romano Prodi even called the pact [stupid](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/2832505/Germanys-deficit-to-smash-EU-limits.html). I'm sure the Italians are laughing now. 

We repeatedly [tried to](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/28/news/28iht-franc_ed3__0.html) convince especially France that this was a bad idea. But they wouldn't listen. 

Do you get the point I'm trying to make? You make all kinds of rules, just like we would for a federal EU. And then France and Germany agree that they will do something else and no one can stop them. This is EXACTLY how a federal EU is going to look. So now, I'd rather stay a country than become a small state in some people's wet dream.

&gt;I wouldn't mind. The economic advantages of joining the US outweigh any legal and cultural differences. Btw, that's how representative democracies work.

This is my biggest issue. Turkey would be the biggest country in the EU. (German population is contracting, so they would be pretty soon.) I don't want the most influential country in the union to be an extremely conservative muslim country, where the government bans Youtube and Twitter for saying bad things about the president. 

And yes. Islam is part of the reason for me. Islam is horrible. The leader of the Norwegian Islamic Council (recognised as a moderate islamic organisation) came to my school to talk about Islam and stuff. And he outright said that it was more important for muslims to follow islamic rules than to follow the laws of the country they're in. I don't think that is acceptable at all. I honestly don't. 

Turkey is also a pretty poor country, and opening up the EU to 80 million more people will surely lead to more wage dumping. I don't want the Ukraine or Belarus to become EU members, either.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;They have increased taxation.

Not across the board, for example Ireland chose to maintain its low corporate tax rate.

&gt;But there's a limit to how much you can do that before you don't raise any more money.

There's also a limit to cutting social services where you end up with less economic activity and less tax income. That limit has been crossed eagerly.

&gt;As for printing money, I agree the ECB should have done this a lot more to stimulate economic activity, but it still doesn't make the books of member states' balance. It's crazy the number of people who just shout at austerity without grasping the basic issue that needs to be solved.

The basic issue is that the cost of the financial crisis has been devolved to the working class rather than born by the financial sector themselves.

&gt;As for your last point, austerity refers to government spending, not private spending. You're right it hits the poor more, but that's because the rich are less dependent on government spending. Limiting private spending would just make the situation worse, as it would reduce tax receipts - requiring more cuts in government spending.

But private spending *has* been severely impacted by cutting social security! It's the working class who spend their paychecks on goods and services. People and institutions with a lot of financial reserves sit on them until they see a profitable opportunity, and will keep doing so until we force their hand with inflation or wealth taxation. You don't need to punish people with little wealth to make them spend, just give them money. It has been exhaustible documented that social spending had a multiplicative effect of more than 100%: you generate more economic activity than the money it costs the state.",0,1403687895,null,0,false,0,cigjyku,t3_28xkwz,t1_cigjyku,t1_cigjeic,null,1434394670,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; Ces députés sans groupe n’ont pas la possibilité de déposer des amendements, ni de participer aux réunions des présidents de groupes qui décident de l’agenda législatif.

C'est reprendre quasi mot pour mot l'argumentaire de MLP qui a été prouvé faux. D'après [factcheck.eu](https://factcheckeu.org/fr/factchecks/show/487/marine-le-pen):

Pour les rapports (pas dans cet article mais souvent cité)
&gt;En effet, un classement de tous les députés européens non-inscrits montre que beaucoup d'entre eux ont rédigé des rapports, soit en tant que principal rapporteur, soit en qualité de rapporteur fictif. Le député européen non-inscrit le plus actif, Martin Ehrenhauser, a été rapporteur fictif de 163 rapports et en a rédigé deux (même s'il s'agit généralement de rapports de moindre importance). (A titre indicatif rapport de MLP = 0)

Pour les amendements :
&gt;Toutefois, Madame Le Pen omet commodément de dire qu'avant que le projet de loi arrive en plénière, il est discuté au sein de la commission parlementaire compétente, là ou tout député peut proposer des amendements. En regardant de nouveau l'activité des autres membres non-inscrits, nous pouvons observer que la plupart d'entre eux ont proposer des amendements. Andreas Moelzer obtient d'ailleurs la première place de ce classement en ayant amendé 196 rapports et se retrouve également 18ème au classement total du Parlement.

Bref il ne faut pas minimiser le fait d'être Non-Inscrits, ces députés ont certains pouvoir et certaines capacité d'actions, certes moindre que ceux qui sont dans un groupe politique. Néanmoins ça reste la volonté du FN de ne pas avoir chercher à fédérer plus large autour de lui (avec l'EFD ou l'ECR par exemple). 

Perso je pense que MLP a ""perdu"" son combat avec Farage pour devenir la figure de proue de l'euroscepticisme au PE (hmm pardon, euroréalisme). Avec à peu près le même nombre de députés, voir les deux formations dans le même groupe aurait été interessant. Il ne faut pas oublier que c'est grâce à une defection du FN (et à par le changement veste des Démocrates Suédois) que l'EFD du UKIP a réussi à se maintenir.

Et puis les Lepen au Parlement Européen, ça a pas une bonne réput'.

true,MasterOfWhisperers,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Not across the board, for example Ireland chose to maintain its low corporate tax rate.

Right, because a huge part of Ireland's economy is only based there due to the low corporate tax rate. If they put it up, the Googles and other companies would leave, and they'd have less money. Tax isn't some magic thing that you can endlessly raise and bring in more money.

&gt; There's also a limit to cutting social services where you end up with less economic activity and less tax income. That limit has been crossed eagerly.

Actually, every cut in social services will reduce tax income from the first dollar. But the reduction in revenue is smaller than the reduction in saving. In economics speak, the multiplier is less than one. If it were different, you could endlessly raise government spending and bring in more money.

&gt; The basic issue is that the cost of the financial crisis has been devolved to the working class rather than born by the financial sector themselves.

Quite possibly, although I would note there have been huge costs to the financial sector, several bank collapses and massive job losses. However, we weren't talking about who's hurting, we were talking about how to address fiscal deficits, many of which were in place even during the boom times. I agree we need regulation to stop the situation again, but that doesn't change the fact that if you're spending beyond your means, you can't not address spending in resolving that. This is a cold, hard economic truth that class warriors don't want to recognise.


&gt; But private spending has been severely impacted by cutting social security! It's the working class who spend their paychecks on goods and services. People and institutions with a lot of financial reserves sit on them until they see a profitable opportunity, and will keep doing so until we force their hand with inflation or wealth taxation. You don't need to punish people with little wealth to make them spend, just give them money. It has been exhaustible documented that social spending had a multiplicative effect of more than 100%: you generate more economic activity than the money it costs the state.

Social spending has a multiplicative effect on *GDP* of more than 100%, but not on tax revenue. Yes, if you spend money on social spending, you get some of it back through the mechanisms you describe, but certainly not all of it back. It's not free for the government to do this. Thus if you're spending more than you can afford as a government, and you simply have to make the books balance because nobody will lend you any more, cutting back on spending will balance the books. It sucks, but it's the grim economic truth. Inflation does not close government deficits, and wealth taxes simply don't bring in much money - go and look at the public accounts in France if you don't believe me.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"&gt; Either the World Economic Forum is wrong or Europe is in deep trouble. The latest competitiveness rankings from the Swiss think-tank list Finland as the most competitive country in the EU. At first, the country’s business leaders thought someone was pulling their leg. But the news was real. If Finland is the best the EU can offer, we should all be very concerned.

&gt; For a start, Finland’s economy has not grown in five years. The unemployment rate is 9 per cent. The flagship company, Nokia, was forced to sell its handset business to Microsoft last year. Its shipyards are in trouble; its forestry companies are cutting costs and closing plants. Public expenditure is expected to reach 58 per cent of gross domestic product this year – a larger share of output even than France. Its middle class pays one of the highest income tax rates in Europe. Its public debt is growing. And matters will only worsen: the Finnish population is ageing faster than that of any other European country.

&gt; It is easy to see why Finland is widely admired by aficionados of the equal society. There are hardly any capitalists left there. Nokia is no longer producing millionaires, and those who come from “old money” have seen the value of their investments decline. Viewed through the lens of the Gini index – the most common indicator of income inequality – that looks like a big success. Finland registers about 25, far lower than the European average of about 30.

&gt; It is much more difficult to fathom why the WEF has ranked Finland as the world’s third most competitive country, after Switzerland and Singapore. Perhaps it is because of Angry Birds or Clash of Clans, extremely popular mobile games created in Finland. Perhaps it is because Klaus Schwab, the WEF’s founder, trained in Finland as a young man. Perhaps it is because of his organisation’s heavy emphasis on institutions.

&gt; The report’s authors define competitiveness as “the set of institutions, policies, and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country”. But Finland’s experience shows that having well-functioning institutions is not a cure-all. The country ticks all the boxes: well-protected property rights, good schools, reliable infrastructure, predictable macroeconomic policies. It is one of the biggest spenders on research and development in the world. Yet the productivity of Finnish industries has plummeted since 2009.

&gt; In part, this is down to bad luck – which came to Finland in the form of Steve Jobs. The iPhone erased Nokia’s lead in mobile phones, while the iPad decimated Finland’s paper industry as people discarded newsprint for digital news. But it is also the result of bad policies. Until recently the country was governed by a coalition of no fewer than six parties spanning the ideological spectrum from conservatives to former communists – with the Greens, and the representatives of the Swedish-speaking minority, thrown in for good measure. No wonder Jyrki Katainen, the former prime minister, decided to seek a Brussels job instead.

&gt; Unlike Sweden, the country has resisted introducing sticks and carrots for the unemployed that are needed to make its labour markets work. The result is a yawning gap in labour participation rates – of almost 5 percentage points in Sweden’s favour. Nor has Finland answered calls from the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund to restructure its inefficient local government and cut public spending.

&gt; There are two lessons from this sorry story. First, well-functioning institutions do not always translate into competitiveness. It seems that there is a point where further investments in public institutions become counterproductive. At that point the emphasis must be on reducing the size of the public sector and easing the tax burden.

&gt; Second, leadership matters. Had Nokia been more successful in responding to the iPhone challenge the country might be able to afford its very large public sector.

&gt; Had the Finnish government introduced reforms immediately after the shockwaves of the financial crisis hit in 2009 we might deserve to be ranked the most competitive country in the EU – but that is not where we are today. The incoming government of Alexander Stubb has bolder plans than its predecessor. It must see them through.

Pretty much since the end of the WW2 the leaders of the benelux started to lobby for a EEC like organization. That's why the pm of Belgium is mentioned in the wikipedia article. This is why the benelux countries were also one of the founders. Besides Schumann mentioning peace a lot as you corrected me, France didn't trust Germany and vice versa. 

You are correct that benelux alone couldn't do it. However they were the perfect partners to start the EEC. They were already experienced in the matter and were a neutral party to both Germany and France.

In other words, those people drink themself to death. Now you can not do that by just drinking every once in a while, that is why russian males also have way more absent days and days where they come in not 100% ready for work to put it mildly.

Historical analysis containing the word ""if"" is generally useless, and you're ignoring the whole cold war thing. France and Germany warring while there's the Volksarmee lurking at the inner-German border and the Red Army just behind that, madness. The soviets wouldn't stop at the Rhine, they'd say ""thank you for exhausting yourselves"".

All posturing cast aside, the western alliance was never questioned during the cold war, not by the powers that were.

France again and again stresses that relationship, with whatnot say forcing Germany into the Euro, but Germany certainly isn't keen on giving it up no matter how bratty the French turn out to be this decade.

What would have happened if Hitler would've been hired by a Jewish architect to do architectural drawings? What would've happened if a certain person in Sarajevo had had a cold and a certain archduke didn't die?

Such questions are useful if you want to dig deeper into the web of causality that surrounds these topics, but useless when it comes to synthesis of interpretations. The past knows no ""if"". The people that acted back then didn't ask ""but what if that didn't happen"", and they did, as a consequence, also not act on such a basis.

&gt; You are correct that benelux alone couldn't do it. However they were the perfect partners to start the EEC. They were already experienced in the matter and were a neutral party to both Germany and France.

Well then let's agree to agree?

The interesting thing is that not only is the Parliamentary Conservative Party united in opposing Juncker, but that the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrat Party have also been forced to publicly say that they do not support Juncker and that their MEPs will vote against him in the EP. Effectively the only person in British politics who wants Juncker as Commission President is Farage. We will therefore be left with a situation in which of the 73 British MEPs, at least 64 of them will vote against Juncker in the European Parliament (I'm not sure how the three Green, two Scottish Nationalist, three Northern Irish and one Plaid Cymru MEPs will vote). Presumably the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrat Party have realised that support for Juncker would lose them votes. It will be interesting to see how many other MEPs across the EU oppose Juncker: currently it is looking like the UK faction will dominate that block.

It is also interesting (and somewhat surprising) that opinion polling has showed that by 2:1 voters in the UK believe that even if Cameron loses the upcoming battle in Ypres over Juncker, that Cameron will appear strong rather than weak. Cameron is likely to get a boost in the polls for voting against Juncker, perhaps making re-election more likely in the general election next year.

It is also interesting that after a few months of the ""in"" campaign moving ahead in polling, over the last week ""out"" seems to have caught up again, presumably partly because of the Juncker situation.

Poi qualcosa si è rotto, la FIGC non ha più investito come una volta tramite i contributi delle sue federazioni provinciali in questo settore del vivaio, molte squadre hanno chiuso o hanno dovuto fondersi anche con una squadra unica per 10-12 squadre prendendo anche mezza provincia che una volta erano indipendenti e i genitori non possono fare avanti-indietro a portare i figli a calcio, i costi di iscrizione (kit con le maglie ufficiali, borsone, tute, giubbotti, gasolio per il pulmino per le trasferte, costi dell'impianto e gli allenatori già fanno scuola aggratis) sono lievitati in alto e c'è un calo delle iscrizioni spaventoso perchè affrontabile solo ormai da famiglie danarose.

I didn't say it wasn't important. I said actual peak performance at that age is irrelevant.

All education up until that point is positioning for either university or vocational schooling. The point is the best way to prepare children for university is the long way rather than the easy way. Kids who depend upon rote learning fall to pieces once they are doing something difficult. The schools that dominate the PISA rankings are universally the schools that teach kids to learn in a way that will prove ineffective later on.

&gt; I'll also note from personal experience the kids who were smartest at 16 in my school are still the smartest today so I don't see how thinigs really change that much in a few years.

Within a nation all kids will be taught the same way. So yeah the best kids will be the best probably forever. If you taught one group via rote learning and another group by teaching understanding you'd see a big difference. In fact we see that big difference precisely in the results at higher education. By the fact that nearly all the great science and engineering feats of the world are done in the west.

However the issue with marriage is that there are specific laws regarding married people that would not apply to anyone else who enters into such a contract.

So we have to consider, then, why these laws exist and why we give these benefits to certain couples who have entered into these contracts. And even why they exist in the first place, and if there even should be any laws regarding them at all.

I was under the impression that a lot of the reason behind this is children - and so if the intent is to subsidise child bearing/raising unions, it would make more sense to specifically target that, because otherwise if you're giving tax breaks to a polygamous marriage between 8 eunuchs who have no intention of raising children, I think you have to at least stop and ask why on earth that is before getting carried away with ""marriage for all"" being recognised by the government.

Sure I don't care if people want these contracts to apply in every which way, but the only reason for the government to even get involved is the money aspect of it all, anyway.

So I'm of the opinion that the money aspect should be addressed specifically and objectively, and marriage as a government institution can stop existing for all I care. Or not.

Thats the whole point of measuring at that age. If you want to cast out half the people in society by only comparing university students and be a snob about it go ahead but in that case  I'm out of this conversation. After that point there are way too many variables in play to even be able to determine who has a smarter populace or where has the best education system. 

For example I might agree Britain has a few good universitys at the highest level but the cost of good ones is so expensive only a tiny fraction of the population will benefit while in Russia Univeristy is cheap and maybe not as prestigious but a lot more people will benefit from a very good university education.

What is the net effect? well nobody knows because it's impossible to really measure but I can see is 56.47% of Russian people hold a third level degree which is the 4th highest in the world.

The real problem with immigration is that the people emigrating are usually from the lowest social classes of a country who feel they could be doing better elsewhere, and so when they emigrate en masse to another country for jobs there's less jobs for the locals to go around and the locals are exposed to what is essentially the dregs of another society so develop a less than wholesome opinion of the country of origin of immigrants. There's also a *significant* amount of problems introduced if the religion and language of immigrants is different from that of the country they emigrate to because it further solidifies an ""us and them"" vibe, and leads to immigrants forming closed communities due to negative attitudes from locals and desire for protection and people like themselves to socialise with. 

Those conflicts happen whenever there's any mass immigration that goes on.

Allerdings ist die Darstellung der Taz leider etwas einseitig, und unterscheidet sich doch stark von dem Bericht den ich im Radio gehört habe (wo unter anderem ein Journalist der vor Ort war berichtete).

Fakt ist nunmal, auch wenn es ein großer Haufen Scheisse ist, auch die Rechten haben ihre Rechte. Dieser ""SS-Siggi"" wurde nunmal gewählt und hat damit auch das Recht an der Wahlparty teilzunehmen.
Das man dagegen demonstriert ist völlig legitim. In dem Bericht den ich im Radio gehört habe wurde es allerdings ganz klar so dargestellt, das die Gewalt von Seiten der Demonstranten ausging. Und das ist nicht mehr legitim. ""Meine Meinung ist die moralische, also darf ich sie mit jedem Mittel durchsetzen"" oder wie soll man das verstehen?

Ja, gegen Rechtsextremisten muss demonstriert werden. Aber ein Problem das viel zu viele linke Demonstrationen haben, ist das da immer ein paar Hanseln dabei sind, die meinen ihre moralische Überlegenheit mit allen Mitteln durchzusetzen, auch wenn das bedeutet gegen das Gesetz zu verstoßen. Und das ist nun mal ein Problem, denn das zwingt die Polizei gegen die Demonstranten vorzugehen.
Dann hinterher rumzuheulen das die Polizei die Nazis schützt ist einfach nur rückgratlos und lächerlich.

Stellen wir uns die Situation doch mal anders vor:

Die Demonstranten hätten versucht die Nazis ohne Gewalt am Zugang zur Party zu hindern, vermutlich hätte die Polizei sie dann irgendwann aufgefordert das zu unterlassen, da es für die Demonstranten (meineswissens) kein Recht gibt auf das sie die Blockade stützen können.
Was wäre dann passiert?

Sie ist nur bei Leuten größer, die nicht verstehen, dass die Amerikaner auf diese Weise auch die Fähigkeiten der deutschen Spionageabwehr testen.  Wenn man sich jemanden zum Verbündeten macht, dann macht man sich auch potenziell anfällig.  Nur indem die Amerikaner selber abhören, können sie abschätzen, was sie den Deutschen mitteilen können, und was sie ihnen lieber vorenthalten.

Ich vermute, dass viele Menschen hierüber nur deswegen empört sind, weil sie sich über die Lebensrealität im 21. Jahrhundert mutwillig hinwegtäuschen, da sie sie sonst nicht mehr aushalten könnten.

Dass die Armen keine Fettquellen haben, kann allein deshalb schon nicht richtig sein, weil Fette für die Funktion des Körpers essentiell sind. Klar, die hauen sich nicht zwei halbe Hähnchen in der Woche rein, aber mit irgendwas müssen diese Menschen ihren Fettbedarf decken (vermutlich pflanzliche Öle/Fette), sonst könnten sie nicht überleben.

&gt;Wenn ich ihnen aber dann Fette zukommen lassen, könnte ich ihnen auch gleichzeitig eben vernünftiges Gemüse zukommen lassen und deren Ernährungsgrundlage ändern.

Das ist doch genau der Punkt. Man könnte so viel für diese Menschen tun, es macht nur keiner. Deshalb haben die Forscher, die am Golden Rice gearbeitet haben, sich zum Ziel gesetzt etwas zu entwickeln, das leicht umzusetzen ist und vor allem in die Hände der Betroffenen gegeben wird. Wie oben bereits erwähnt: keiner der Leute, die am Golden Rice gearbeitet haben, glaubt, damit die weltweite Armut besiegt zu haben. Aber das bringt mich zum nächsten Punkt:

&gt;So ist das nur eine zynische Gentechnik-Werbeaktion.

Damit verzerrst du den tatsächlichen Ablauf der Forschung. Das Projekt hat an einer öffentlichen Universität begonnen und wurde, weil die Mittel aus der öffentlichen Hand nicht ausgereicht haben, ab einem gewissen Punkt unter anderem auch von Syngenta finanziert.

Für zynisch halte ich es, sich als Europäer auf ein Podest zu stellen und zu sagen, dass es besser ist wenn die Leute in Asien verhungern, als dass ein Konzern der mit Gentechnik arbeitet ein bisschen positive PR einfährt. Ich weiß, das ist eine überspitzte Darstellung deiner Argumentation - vor allem weil du davon überzeugt scheinst, dass GR eben niemanden vor dem Verhungern rettet - aber das macht in meinen Augen trotzdem ein grundlegendes Problem deutlich. Welches Recht haben Interessensgruppen wie Greenpeace (die zu großen Teilen aus ""privilegierten Weißen"" besteht) sich derart einzumischen? Sind die paar PR-Punkte für Syngeta und das ganze Geschwurbel um trojanische Pferde wirklich die Menschenleben wert, die dabei verloren gehen? Ist es besser gar nicht zu helfen, anstatt auf unvollkommene Art und Weise?

Shortly after South Africa had discontinued its use of DDT and replaced it with synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, a highly efficient malaria vector, Anopheles funestus (which had been completely eradicated from the country in the 1970s), reappeared. Within just a few years, the incidence of malaria nationwide increased more than tenfold (from 6,000 cases in 1995, to 62,000 cases in 2000). Desperate to scale back this re-emerging crisis, the South African government resumed its use of DDT in 2001 (disregarding UN warnings against such a course of action), and within months the malaria rate dropped by four-fifths.

Je sais bien qu'en France on imagine toujours les investisseurs comme des gros capitalistes en haut de forme avec un cigare a la bouche, mais dans beaucoup de pays les investisseurs sont ni plus ni moins que les travailleurs, qui épargnent pour leur retraite.

Les milliards de dollars qui s'échangent sur les marchés financiers appartiennent en grande partie aux classes moyennes.

L'alternative a la finance, c'est l'état. C'est ce qui se passe en France : l'état qui s'occupe des retraites, qui s'occupe de l'épargne (redirigée via les assurances-vie vers la dette publique).

Penser que l'état est meilleur gestionnaire, que l'état est plus honnête et moins désintéressé, c'est se mettre le doigt dans l'œil.

Tous les fonds gérés par l'état, sans exception, sont en déficit. Parce que les hommes politiques n'épargnent pas l'argent public. Un euro non dépensé, c'est une voix en moins.

Using technology and automation, we could feasibly get rid of 90% of all jobs within a few decades and still be technically capable of providing for the physical needs of the entire population. Especially if the population starts to decline as it has already begun in many European countries. Especially if we embrace a culture that is not based on consumerism and materialism. 

In my mind it's just a question of whether we will pursue that route or will we continue the capitalist route where everyone has to ""earn"" a living even though machines are taking over most of the work, where we have to keep growing the economy for no actual reason, other than to grow the economy for it's own sake and to keep the wealthy, wealthy and powerful.

Basically our economic system needs to change radically to adapt to a new reality and so does our culture. The consumerism and materialism that drives our destructive society must be replaced by something else, in my opinion. Otherwise I think it's likely we will face severe challenges in terms of income inequality as people are forced to compete with machines that can work 24/7 and require no retirement or medical insurance, or coffee breaks.

Desire and actions may not necessarily be aligned. For example, a study conducted in Tallinn among mothers of one-year-olds concluded that only 7% wished to return to work at that time. Sadly, many cannot afford to stay at home beyond the 18 month maternity leave that we have. 

&gt; The idea that babies need to basically be attached to their mothers is not what modern science says at all. Mothers are not the only attachment figures of babies. Do you have a source for that claim?

&gt;j'ai bien peur que tout ceci s'écroule si les mêmes corrélations étaient recherchées par exemple entre population immigrée et population locale de même conditions socio-économiques que les populations immigrées

Les travaux de [Hugues Lagrange](http://www.telerama.fr/idees/hugues-lagrange-et-le-facteur-culturel,60726.php) ont montré que à classe sociale similaire, les jeunes issus du Sahel sont plus souvent délinquants que les Maghrébins, que d'autres populations d'Afrique, et que les autres populations pauvres d'origine non africaines.

Pas étonnant vu leur culture avec en particulier une faible autorité parentale, une place de la femme assez basse (qui a des impacts sur l'influence des enseignantes) mais beaucoup d'enfants...

&gt;Tu noteras aussi que plus loin il est écrit ""Crude generalizations that have given the impression that rapists are only foreigners – and primarily Muslims – are shown to be inadequate and erroneous

Oui. Je n'ai jamais fait de telles généralisations.

Par contre, j'ai dit et je maintiens que l'immigration augmente la délinquance et la criminalité. 

C'est pas compliqué de comprendre que les gens pauvres, non éduqués et d'une culture différente (dont on a déjà parlé) vont avoir plus de chances de devenir chômeurs ou délinquants.

&gt;Bref, c'est un travers classique de l'extrême droite de ne pas savoir interpréter des données statistiques

Ça me fait marrer. Même en tenant compte des caractéristiques sociales et de distribution des ages, la surreprésentation des immigrés hors UE et Français d'origine immigrée hors UE dans la délinquance ne correspond pas avec la surreprésentation des immigrés chez les pauvres et non éduqués : il y a bien plus de délinquants qu'il devrait y en avoir si le fonctionnement était le même quelle que soit l'origine.

Ça c'est de la rigueur statistique, c'est mon boulot. Quand il n'y a pas d'opportunités de travail légal (on a 5 millions de chômeurs donc ça ne risque pas d'arriver) et qu'il y a de l'immigration pauvre, non éduquée et de cultures différentes, ça provoque une augmentation de la délinquance.

Ça ne veut pas dire que l'immigration est responsable de la délinquance, que sans immigration il n'y aurait pas de délinquance, ou que seuls les immigrés sont délinquants, contrairement à ce que les malhonnêtes veulent nous faire dire.",0,1403703072,null,0,false,0,cign9lm,t3_28y18c,t1_cign9lm,t1_cigj3ev,null,1434396230,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

It's funny you should choose England though - and not one of the other countries. Here are the numbers I came up with on [this](http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/alcohol/by-country/) site for alchol related deaths. And [here](http://www.indexmundi.com/) is where you can look at life expectancy and other demographics per country.

- Denmark : 9.9 alcohol related deaths per 100'000 *(76 years male life expectancy)*

- Estonia : 9.2 *(68.5)*

- France : 4.0 *(78)*

- Germany : 3.9 *(78)*

- Austria : 3.4 *(77)*

- Latvia : 3.1 *(68)*

- Russia : 2.7 *(64)*

- Sweden : 2.1 *(79)*

- Finland : 2.0 *(76)*

- Switzerland : 1.8 *(80)*

- USA : 1.6 *(76)*

- UK : 1.1 *(78)*

- **Georgia - a country where the women in mgmt statstic is at 35% has 0.3 alchohol related deaths per 100'000 and male life expectancy of 74 years**

I see discrepancies in these statistics that you've put on the table. For one - there are countries in the FSU where women in mgmt is high but deaths from alcohol is low. **Whilst women in mgmt is high in ALL former soviet countries, deaths from alcohol and male life expectancy differs depending on the country.**",0,1403703683,null,0,false,0,cignhen,t3_291g28,t1_cignhen,t1_cigkr29,null,1434396337,25,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,25

Too many people on reddit (or I should more broadly say, people of our demographic) think Western society is this progressive bastion. You're not alone in thinking this about your country. There is opposition to gay marriage in many western countries even where it is legal. Everywhere from the US and Canada, to France. Remember the largest protests in a decade in France where demonstrations against gay marriage.

Just because everyone you talk to in your country supports gay marriage, doesn't mean everyone else in your country supports it. Not everyone in western countries are college educated, progressive 20-something year olds. People on reddit forget that sometimes.

Well, one of the accusations is that he didn't use a condom despite that being a precondition to consent. That's not the rape accusation though. It's certainly a very common misunderstanding, probably because of how ruthlessly it was spread early on in the investigation, when few had access to any concrete facts. The actual case labelled as rape is that he allegedly penetrated a woman he was sharing a bed with, while she was still asleep. To further confuse matter, he supposedly didn't use a condom in this instance either, but here it's only an aggravating circumstance.

According to her statement she ""tried to put on some articles of clothing as it was going too quickly and uncomfortably but Assange ripped them off again"". Miss A told police that she didn't want to go any further ""but that it was too late to stop Assange as she had gone along with it so far"", and so she allowed him to undress her.

&gt;According to the statement, Miss A then realised he was trying to have unprotected sex with her.

The statement records Miss A describing how Assange then released her arms and agreed to use a condom, but she told the police that at some stage Assange had ""done something"" with the condom that resulted in it becoming ripped, and ejaculated without withdrawing.

&gt;Miss W told police that though they started to have sex, Assange had not wanted to wear a condom, and she had moved away because she had not wanted unprotected sex. Assange had then lost interest, she said, and fallen asleep. However, during the night, they had both woken up and had sex at least once when ""he agreed unwillingly to use a condom"".

&gt;Early the next morning, Miss W told police, she had gone to buy breakfast before getting back into bed and falling asleep beside Assange.

Ein Beispiel: 

&gt;""Ökostrom ist alles andere als grün - das ist eine Lüge""


&gt;**Die Zahlen sind von 1995. Inzwischen sind die Solarpaneele doch deutlich effizienter.**

&gt;Das stimmt. Die Materialeffizienz von Photovoltaik und damit auch die Ökobilanz hat sich seit 1995 um den Faktor drei bis vier verbessert. Aber: Die alten Anlagen laufen noch. Aber lassen wir diesen Gedanken beiseite und gehen wir von den neusten Anlagen aus. Dann haben wir immer noch einen Ressourcenverbrauch, der ähnlich ist wie der von Strom bei der Atomkraft oder bei Gaskraftwerken. Der vermeintliche „Ökostrom“ aus Photovoltaikanlagen ist also selbst beim aktuellen Stand der Technik alles andere als „grün“. Der Begriff ist Augenwischerei oder noch krasser formuliert: Beschiss.

Weint er da echt rum, dass eine Industrie -die sich gerade erst seit ein wenig mehr als einem Jahrzehnt manierlich etablieren kann- noch keine angemessene Materialeffizienz erreicht hat?

Wie dreist muss man sein, um Energien die sich noch lange nicht am technologischen Zenit befinden per Effizienzvergleich die Existenzgrundlage abzusprechen. Der einzige Sinn der Einführung der Energiewende per StrEG und später EEG war das triggern des technologischen Fortschritts von Photovoltaik und Windkraft.

Übrigens: Was ist diese Messung in Kilogramm Ressourcen eigentlich für ein Unsinn? Ressource ist nicht gleich Ressource. Manche sind erneuerbar, viele sind recyclebar (Neodym bei Windkraft zb) und manche sind nicht erneuerbar. Daher: Ersetzen von nicht erneuerbaren Energien durch erneuerbare Energien.

Außerdem: Die alleinige Existenz von Atomkraftwerken und der entsprechenden Infrastruktur ist langfristig ein hohes Umweltrisiko, die Abschaffung macht also wie er selber zugibt also doch Sinn. Trotzdem gibt er sich nicht mit der Effizienz der Ersatzenergien zufrieden, das finde Ich in Verbindung mit meiner oberen Ausführung als effekthascherisch und kurzsichtig.

Oder:

&gt;Diese Abwrackprämie ist ein Paradebeispiel für Politik ohne Sinn und Verstand. Mit Milliarden Steuergeldern wurde die Autoindustrie gepampert. Ich glaube nicht, dass Mercedes, BMW &amp; Co. das nötig haben.

Die Abwrackprämie war ein getarntes nachfrageorientieres Konjunkturpaket für den Automobilsektor und hatte essenziell nichts mit Umweltpolitik zu tun. Egal, wer das damals in irgendeiner Art offiziell so hingestellt hat, es war dummes Gerede. Die Abwrackprämie war ein Konjunkturpaket der damals klammen Autoindustrie.

Also you used the life expectancy argument. In Georgia - despite drug problems - male life expectancy is comparable to Western Europe. The difference between 74 in Georgia and 78 in Germany isn't because of drugs, it's because the FSU is a collection of 2nd world countries with harder work, and more people working in the primary sector *(mines, factories, farms etc)* - jobs that wear people down faster and take a stronger toll on health, and because overall health in general is not as good as in the western EU.

true,noholds,EURO,Europa,"&gt; dass mein Gegenüber einfach nicht weiss wie Wissenschaft funktioniert

Das ist mMn das allergrößte Problem, das die meisten verschwörungstheoretisch geprägten Gruppen und Menschen haben. Was ich jetzt so oft beobachtet habe, ist der Glaube, man würde mit irgendwelchen Hinterhof-Experimenten auf dem gleichen Niveau arbeiten wie studierte Naturwissenschaftler in einem Labor, und dass über Jahrzehnte gefestigten Theorien mit einfachsten Konstruktionen widerlegt werden könnten. 

[Wunderbares Beispiel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiAhiu6UqXQ). Alles daran ist mit Mittelstufenphysik erklärbar (vielleicht nicht wie Dioden funktionieren, aber das ist nicht wirklich von Belang. Es reicht aus zu wissen, dass Leuchtdioden eine sehr niedrige Betriebsspannung gegenüber herkömmlichen Glühbirnen haben), aber den Leuten mangelt es an naturwissenschaftlicher Ausbildung um den Mechanismus zu erkennen und vor allem um zu wissen, dass die Kraft, und die damit verbundene umgesetzte Energie, die ein Stabmagnet ausübt, nicht einfach aus dem nichts kommt, sondern dass auch Dauermagneten erst unter hohem Energieaufwand magnetisiert werden müssen und, da das System nicht geschlossen ist, es insgesamt zu einem Energie*verlust* kommt. 

Noch schlimmer ist dann allerdings, wenn komplexe Sachverhalte aus dem Kontext gerissen werden um damit irgendwas zu erklären. Bei dem Video von eben wurde zB. auch der [Casimir Effekt](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir-Effekt) als Ursache genannt.

true,Chobeat,nostalgico,,"""bisogno"" in senso stretto, quasi nessuna. Infatti la posizione della comunità italiana è totalmente anti-politica nel senso che si campa lo stesso. Una legge contro la discriminazione non farebbe male ma si va avanti senza da più di 40 anni e va tutto bene finché si rimane nell'ombra. All'estero, dove la comunità è ormai uscita dall'ombra da almeno un decennio e anche più, la pensano diversamente.

Tuttavia in molte legislazioni nazionali ci sono diverse leggi scritte senza tenere in conto le necessità di questa nicchia di persone, che vanno a complicare parecchio  la vita di chi pratica, in alcuni casi. Ad esempio in Italia c'è l'obbligo di denuncia per danni fisici con prognosi superiore ai 20 giorni, a prescindere dal consenso. Per dire, stai facendo un gioco erotico con tuo marito, vi fate male, vai all'ospedale e il medico ti obbliga a denunciare, fondamentalmente per il principio che il tuo corpo non ti appartiene integralmente e non è un bene disponibile, visto che se ti fai male o muori, la collettività ci rimette. Sacrosanto, ma adattare la cosa  in base alle necessità dei kinkster non sarebbe male. Non è percepita come una necessità urgente dalla comunità ma è uno dei punti ricorrenti quando si tratta l'argomento.

Una cosa che invece gioverebbe molto  sarebbe la possibilità di poter aprire locali BDSM con tutele per organizzatori e partecipanti, cosa che in Italia non si può fare mentre all'estero ci sono regolamentazioni esplicite o comunque quelle esistenti soddisfano i bisogni di entrambe le parti. 

Un'altra roba figa sarebbe la possibilità di aprire consultori (privati, pubblici è ancora fuori dal mondo) sulla sessualità alternativa come ci sono in Canada e UK che in Italia non si possono aprire non mi ricordo bene perché.

Di cose da migliorare ce ne sarebbero più d'una ma appunto, la comunità è ancora immatura e la società italiana ancora di più. Non c'è la percezione che sia necessaria un'esposizione politica e non spero nemmeno che ci sia. Bisogna anche vedere come si evolvono questo tipo di cose all'estero.

Da attivista e divulgatore per me la priorità sta nell'acquisire visibilità seria e sana e spiegare alla gente che chi fa queste cose son persone normalissime, i loro vicini di casa, i loro panettieri, i loro politici, gli insegnanti dei loro figli e i medici che li curano quando stanno male e non alieni malati e pervertiti.

true,the_viper,FINL,Finland,"&gt; That's not really true though. Russia (and several other former Soviet states) did a horrible job at privatising assets-- something the west really cannot be blamed for --

How can the west not be blamed, it was western advisors and the same economic hitmen who messed up south america along with the IMF who steered them through the whole thing.

&gt; When resource rights were sold, they were not put on open market auctions for the highest bidder; they were privately sold to well-connected individuals with government links (especially KGB ones).

That's not strictly true although in the end it did go that way, To begin with there was the vouchers system where state assets were divided up in a sort of national lottery IIRC, the shares were given out to the population but 1/1000th of some factory worth to a person living through the worst times in Russian history who needs to eat. not to mention the fact someone who lived through communism their whole life has no idea what such shares are worth so very soon those who were smart and not so desperate could buy vouchers for pennies on the dollar and build themselves up huge business out of nothing. 

All of this was done under the eyes of the West who were more than happy to watch power move to a few private hands who could be easilly be influenced. 

Yes the whole thing was botched but they werent exactly getting the best advice IMO, I mean why could the state not keep most assets nationalized instead of giving them away for nothing if they were not under pressure to do so? 

I'll admit I don't know the in's and out's and the whole story but regardless of whatever side you like to take when Putin came to power and took the power back from the olligarchs it was the best thing someone could have done to help rebuild the Russian state. 

I believe the west wanted to make sure there was no Russian state hence the botched way it was let go into private hands.

Lot's of it gets consumed by a giant bureaucratic apparatus to pay government employees (many of whom are not value added) good salaries, comfy pension plans that can almost never be reformed when they become underfunded. Furthermore, reducing the scope of government is extremely difficult, and large governments are inherently wasteful. Increasing the size of government means increasing the size of bureaucracy. Just like adding components to a mechanical system inherently increases losses due to friction, so too adding to the size of government means money is lost in the government apparatus. This isn't a good thing.

I am not advocating destroying your social welfare systems. I am suggesting (as is the author), that the government, and subsequently taxes, can and should be reduced in the face of rising deficits and a sluggish economy. If the government is taking in 60% of the money, that is simply far too much. The government taking in 20% may be far too low. The right amount is probably somewhere in between where the citizens of Finland would be comfortable with.

Many governments provide everything you mentioned and take in significantly lower amounts money. People should be able to discuss this without the fear mongering that always accompanies this issue that everything you love about Finland will be destroyed if taxes are lowered even marginally.

Your first link is in relation to Ukraine but you just misread I guess or just happened to not put it in context but in any case nothing was up with the Lithuanian supply and nothing was cut for them.

&gt;  The European Union and Russia traded charges of blackmail on Friday over the future of Ukraine.

&gt; The Kremlin threatened the country with trade losses worth billions and costing hundreds of thousands of jobs if it signed up to a strategic pact with the European Union, senior Lithuanian officials said.


Your second link is firstly relating to oil products and not gas and in fact cites Russia saying it was a brief cut for maintance but again you leave that out 


Your third link is well Fox news so need I say more....... but all I will say is small countries will always have less bargining power than large ones like Germany and the price they pay for gas is on par. Fox news (why would I expect less from them) are of course happy to quote prices from 10 years ago as relevant to today.

Les ""20 ans de recul"" sont globaux et dû à la disposition du monde post crash pétrolier. Il faut arrêter de croire que la croissance à 10% est un dû et sera sempiternel . Remettre la baisse de la croissance extraordinaire des pays civilisés post-WW2 à l'UE et l'Euro me paraît vraiment maladroit comme excuse.


&gt; Ou alors ça tient à la séparation de l'Allemagne en deux après la guerre et à la bombe atomique qui anéantit toute prétention d'invasion militaire... Puis après à la chute de l'URSS. C'est la paix qui a fait la communauté européenne, pas l'inverse.
 


Pas vraiment. En fait ce qu'il faut savoir dans le monde néo-libéral actuel, c'est que l'interdépendance économique des pays fait qu'ils ne sont plus en guerre. Par exemple, s'il y a des tensions entre la Chine et les USA, cela n'atteindra jamais le niveau de la guerre froide : les deux puissance sont aussi partenaires économiques et la chute de l'un entraînerait la chute de l'autre.


Si l'on compare à la dernière guerre majeure (WWII), on remarquera que la grande majorité des gouvernements en guerre avaient tous des politiques intérieures très protectionnistes. Le discours protectionniste d'ailleurs marchait très bien grâce à la récession post-1929 (ça va mal, donc on va arrêter d'importer et être une nation forte et virer les immigrants car ils volent nos emplois, discours démagogue qui ne vieillira jamais et qui séduira les personnes naïves). 


&gt; Par contre, on peut vraiment dire que pour les lobbies, les banques et les multinationales, l'Europe c'est la paie...


Ah mais les dérives financières du capitalisme sauvage des années 70 ne sont pas exclusives à l'Europe. Demande à nos amis les américains ce qu'ils en pensent ahah ! Et ce n'est pas en expulsant quelques immigrés qui n'ont rien à voir que l'on va améliorer la situation.

true,the_viper,FINL,Finland,"&gt; I see no reason why the same could not be the case with Russia and there is no reason to think the US had some malicious hidden intent in the immediate aftermath of the collapse.

You make some good points but let's face it they didn't do a very good job with Russia now did they? After WW2 the US was a real democracy and not the ironic plutocracy it is today and yea it sure did help get Germany and Japan back on their feet but IIRC the thinking at the time was, this was necessary to stop the dreaded spread of communism. 

by the time we get to the 70's 80's and 90's the US was more about taking down governments who were unfavorable to them and installing ones who would do as they were told, I've read confessions of an economic hitman and what they did in South America was criminal so I dont blame those states for hating the US today. 

America built up a huge debt fighting the cold war and unlike WW2 there wasn't going to be the same post war boom due to it's cold nature, none the less the cost was the same so I see perfect logic when thinking about their actions in other states around the same time how they would want to get a payday from the fall of the USSR.

During the 90s I read the Russian state was getting 15 cents on the dolllar for it's oil and gas with a huge amount going to shell and other companies who got to pump and refine it, In any case it was a terrible deal for the state. If America really wanted to help get Russia back on their feat why would they see to it they get as little as possible from their own resources?  

as far as I can see up until 2012  [BP owned Russian oil](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/30/russia-re-nationalizing-its-oil.html) so the only people who seemed to profit were a few olligarchs and western corporations who did the work. 
I've read up a lot on Putins rise to power and it seems all he has done (while also making himself very rich) is take on and fight the olligarchs even though they initally backed himand take back Russian resources from private and foreign control.
While this might not suit the west from a purely neutral standpoint he's not been the world leader given the lot he got when he came to power.

Non discriminazioni violente ma la pratica viene regolarmente derisa e scimmiottata sui media come venivano derisi i neri o gli omosessuali fino a qualche anno fa. Non la si soffre direttamente ma è un blocco forte all'accettazione.

&gt; sicuro? sembra buffo, hai fonti (per dire, non è così per un calciatore che subisce un fallo)

Mi citano sempre la legge quando se ne discute ma a memoria non ti so dire e non saprei dove cercare. Anche a me sembrava buffo ma ne ho discusso fino allo sfinimento, anche con un avvocato e purtroppo non si scappa da 'sta cosa. 

&gt; che tipo di tutele servirebbero?

Se uno si fa male perché è legato in sospensione e viene giù il punto di sospensione, chi deve andare nei cazzi? Chi stava legando o il proprietario del locale? Ora è ambiguo, giusto per dirne una. 

Servirebbero tutele per gli organizzatori nei confronti delle cazzate che possono fare gli avventori e servono tutele per gli avventori per le leggerezze o le furbate che possono compiere gli organizzatori e i proprietari. Adesso è tutto molto wild. In  America ci sono federazioni che ""certificano"" in maniera informale la sicurezza dei locali, la serietà dei ""monitor"" (le persone incaricate di controllare che la gente non faccia cazzate) e cose del genere. In Italia nemmeno quello e la tua sicurezza è solo a carico tuo. Se giochi con un pirla e ti fa dei danni è difficile farlo andare nei cazzi. E la gente non ti può nemmeno mettere in guardia perché sarebbe diffamazione, per la legge. Poi i casi estremi si ostracizzano comunque, ma per la legge italiana tu non puoi andare nemmeno a dire: ""Guarda che quello ha fatto male ad altre n ragazze, attenta"", a meno che non ci siano state condanne. È tutto a mo' di Far West.

true,Pwn3dg,NISA,Niedersachsen,"I'm going to offer an opinion on McD for the most part, because KFC is relatively rare in Germany.

1. ""its not looked down upon to take a date to a fine evening at Micky D's lol?"" Errr... no. Don't do that. McDonald's, together with KFC and Burger King are, I think, the only American fast food places we got here, so I suppose that's some kind of special role. McD and especially KFC are expensive compared to other fast food places though.
2. As far as I know (and I'm relatively often at McD) the clientele is mixed. Mostly though it's made up out of younger people (i. e. people below 50). I don't even know what's super size is. You can, however, take a smaller drink and fries to save money.
3. Young kids? No. College students and people who just graduated High School as well as older people. It's a good mix I guess.
4. I heard they serve beer, but I've never seen somebody order a beer at McD.
5. I think there are some places that offer a delivery service. It depends on store to store though, because they're run individually. I guess in the US McD runs most of the joints by itself, while here most stores are run by someone taking the McD franchise.
6. Fries are called Pommes in Germany. They call them like that too. I think you got things like a quater pounder or so, we don't have that. Also, there are fan made burgers from time to time as well as special offers (for example, World Cup burgers).
7. I think McD tries to attract kids most of the time with ads for their toys from the Happy Meal.
8. As I already mentioned, KFC is rare. My town doesn't have one (~25.000 people), while we have both McD and Burger King. I don't know how frequent these fast food joints are in the US, but I think they're not so frequent here.
9. Too much I guess.

1. More expensive (Big Mac Index), cleaner, slightly better quality, no super size, no refill... No dinner date material but if you are a teenager in rural areas, there is not much to do so it can become a social meeting point. Also the new McCafes are pretty nice actually.

2. Quite different marketing in comparison to the US, they try to appeal to everyone and are somewhat successful with it. But you can also find you doctor shopping in Aldi although he can afford buying food elsewhere so I think its more of a cultural thing they adopted into their strategy. (Germans are cheapskates when it comes to food :( )

3. Mostly young adults and people who need the money (I have seen many single moms in their 40s working there), immigrants usually open their own food business like a Dönerbude

4. Only very few McD do serve beer, as it is the decision of the franchisee. Personally I have never seen it.

5. No delivery in Germany as the density of restaurants is not high enough to make it a viable business strategy (There are some tests though; google McHome)

6. YES, McRib all year round and made from pork... Other than that? The staples are the same and as always McD has 1-2 unique products for that country
They try to push names from time to time. I can remeber the cashiers asking if you want some ""McFries"" with my burger but everyone orders Pommes anyway so they gave up. Also the Quarterpounder became the Royal or Royal TS (Tomato+Salad) because imperial units are confusing!

7. TV advertising, Schweinebauchanzeigen with coupons (usually uncommon in Germany), online banner ads, youtube ads... They do everything!

8. You can say there is one in every town with 30-40k inhabitants. On average there are 1 per 50k but McD scales up in size rather than number of restaurants

9. Yes, you can't pay with you Debit or Credit Card in most restaurants... usually it's cash only and that drives me crazy.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; Why is Cameron anti-Junker?

Cameron is anti-Juncker both as a matter of principle and as a matter of politics.

As a matter of principle, Cameron is anti-Juncker because:

- Cameron's vision of the EU is a loose, flexible, accommodating EU, in which powers can move back from the institutions to the member states. Juncker's vision of the EU is an ""ever closer Union"" one, in which the EU gets more powers, moving towards federalism. Thus, they are ideologically opposed.

- Cameron also believes, as a matter of principle, that the Council has more democratic legitimacy than Juncker. He believes that national governments are elected by a greater turn-out, that very few people in the EU electorate had heard of Juncker and that most people voted on national issues.

Cameron is also anti-Juncker as a matter of politics:

- Given that way the UK voted, with UKIP topping the poll and Cameron facing national elections in a year, he has no option but to oppose a federalist Commission president.

- Within the Tory party, Cameron is not very popular and many Conservative MPs are extremely EU-sceptic. In the Tory party, Cameron is seen as very pro-EU. The Tory party's own internal rules allow them to call leadership elections very easily and they have a history of destroying their leaders over Europe. If Cameron were to support Juncker, there is a chance that either the Tory Party get rid of him or cause him a huge amount of grief.

- Last time Cameron said a big ""no"" to Europe, Cameron's poll ratings got a big boost. Saying no to Europe makes Cameron's chance of re-election higher. 

&gt; Why do you think voting UKIP for the EP increases rather than decreases the likelihood of a Brexit?

- Voting UKIP is all about keeping the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems honest. They are forced to change their own positions on the EU. For example, there are now calls by Lib Dem MPs to match the Conservative pledge for a referendum. Labour are starting to move towards that position too.

- Voting UKIP also makes the rest of the EU be annoyed by the UK and start to lose confidence in the long term future of the UK in the EU. This makes rEUers start to resent the UK and it becomes politically acceptable (and even advisable) for mainstream European politicians to start calling for a Brexit and less willing to compromise with the UK. This then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy with the UK becoming more and more isolated.

Nobody thinks that divorce is going to be a good experience for us. It will definitely be painful. But in the end it is better than a loveless marriage.

&gt; La quiche est une entrée tellement populaire au xxie siècle que son nom est désormais employé **à tort** pour désigner des tartes garnies d'un appareil à crème prise, salées et garnies d'ingrédients divers.

Faut pas provoquer un Lorrain comme ça!

Bon okay, j'ai grandi avec ma maman qui me faisait des quiches avec du fromage -ce qui s'appelle d'ailleurs une quiche *vosgienne*, big up à ma maman au passage- mais pour être honnête, je préfère cent fois la recette originale (et avé la muscade, cong!). Le fromage la rend élastique et enlève tout le fondant d'un appareil qui n'aurait été constitué que de crème et d'oeufs.

Je chipote mais allez, je veux bien considérer la quiche avec du fromage comme une quiche véritable mais qu'on ne dise pas ""quiche aux poireaux"", ""quiche au thon"" ou des trucs dans le genre.

**General Atmosphere**

Over the last couple of years, there's been a big effort to make the interior more appealing. Paintings on the walls, less plastic, more wood and leather, adding overpriced McCafés to every branch, etc. I'd always assumed that was a worldwide thing, though. It always seemed fairly clean to me, even before the push for a more restaurant-y atmosphere.

**Taking a date to McDonald's**

Uhm...maybe if you're 15 and broke? *Maybe.*

**Clientele**


Depends on the time of day. Could be the weekend drunk crowd or single dads who just can't be bothered to cook a whole meal *again* or anything in between.

**Super size**

Don't think we ever had that in the first place. Portion sizes in the US are generally much bigger than in Germany. It always takes me a couple of days of asking ""so how big exactly is your medium/large/venti/whatever"", before I get used to the US sizes again. 

I think the most common option is to order a McMenü - medium fries, medium soft drink, (almost) any burger/wrap/sandwich, complementary glass or mug  

**Is the food considered terrible?**

Yes. 

**The people who work there**

Mostly young kids with questionable tattoo choices and middle aged women. A lot of them are Turkish. 

**Beer**

I mean, yeah they have it, but why would you want to order it? It's overpriced Bitburger in a plastic cup. 

**German beer you should try**

Whatever the locals are drinking, wherever you are. Stay away from the big brands and you'll be just fine.

**Delivery**

Nope. 

**Menu Differences**

I'm sure it varies some, probably mostly when it comes to short time offers for the World Cup or skiing season or whatever. Off the top of my head, paying for ketchup and mayo and the whole no refills thing, unless the branch is owned directly by McDonald's. Maybe you should check out their German website and compare.

**How often do you come across them?**

[This](http://static.neuerdings.com/1363186050/mcfinder2_large.jpg) should give you an idea for McDonald's. KFC is much less common. I think I've seen maybe three or four, but after the...""food""? I got there once at a Chinese airport, I'm not too eager to try my luck with them again.

Anyways, what i'm going on about is this:

There are 2 types of debt.

1. Public debt = Debt your government has for things like fixing roads and parks and paying the military

2. External debt = Debt all of your businesses have from outside of the country.

You listed the US external debt which is indeed 17.3 trillion dollars. So I listed the UK external debt which is 10 trillion dollars ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_external_debt ).

Then when you talk about the UK debt you go around and switch to government(public) debt instead of using the external debt like you used for the US so it makes the UK look better than the US when in reality it's not. 

Now go to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_debt and click the little up and down arrows next to ""public debt as % of GDP"" 

This will show the US public debt as 72.50 percent of the economy (GDP) while the UK public debt is 90.0 percent of the economy.

Now start learning at least a little about how things work before talking shit about other countries.

I understand this position, but I think it is starting to become somewhat unrealistic. It is starting to look like there are two possibilities:

(1) a looser, more flexible EU with the UK in it, or the UK having further opt-outs and a permanent ""special status"" within the EU; or

(2) an EU moving towards federalism, but with the UK outside it.

You cannot simply soak the rich indefinitely with no side effects. The article discusses this issue. What other industries does Finland have? Angry Birds? Where are the next big investments going to come from? The average quality of life in Finland may make the citizens comfortable, but it can also make the citizens complacent. 

If the economy is stagnant or in recession, jobs are being lost, government deficits are increasing, clearly something isn't quite right. Are Europeans so one dimensional in their thinking that for every problem, there is a government solution (even when the government is often the source of the problem), and that solution is *always* ""moor taxes plz""?

I mean I get the whole ""fuck the rich for being rich"" thing, but that is an argument for amateurs. In fact, it seems the only argument many Europeans have is ""rich people are jerks"". Why is this line of thought so persistent? Maybe that's why there are no Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos, or Mark Zuckerburgs of Europe. Rich people aren't always evil. And targeting, and indeed villifying successful people is not the key to success. 

Keep in mind, higher taxes don't always solve problems. Often they hide and obscure problems that will only get worse over time. So what should you do? Feel pitty for millionaires?

De Gaulle pour moi (avis personnel) n'est pas la figure modele qu'on veut nous faire manger. Il s'agit d'un culte de la personne initié par De Gaulle lui-même.

Ses failles notamment se révelent dans la constitution de la 5e république et la place trop importante attribuée a la personne du président. 

Sa gestion des crises ne s'est pas trouvée si habile que ça ( Mai 68?).

Des gaffes monumentales sur la scène internationale (vive le Quebec libre? il a même réussi a se mettre a dos ses alliés de la 2e guerre, les anglais, les américains, les russes...).

Il n'a pas bien géré ou vu venir les problèmes liés au baby boom. Bref sa politique est trop axée sur lui, trop dirigiste et du coup en devient risquée. Parfois ca marche avec des éclats de génie et parfois ca échoue.  Le problème vient donc principalement pour moi qu'il construit autour de lui un système qui ne marche qu'avec lui. Est-ce bien ce dont on a besoin aujourd'hui et est-ce bien un modèle.

Tiens en parlant de modèle, je ne comprends pas comment on peut le prendre en modèle libéral quand sa politique est purement opportuniste / dépendant des contextes. Il n'a pas suivi une politique libérale ni conservatrices, ni rien de spécial. ""L'intendance suivra"". Je trouves donc culotté d'utiliser son nom maintenant pour justifier quoi que soit. Surtout un libéralisme économique comme Fillon le propose ce qui est un contresens par rapport aux mesures que De Gaulle avait apporté.

Le monde change, et les modèles doivent changer aussi. On ne peut pas prendre exemple sur ""De Gaulle"" aujourd'hui tout les contextes sont différents autant économiques que politiques ou géopolitiques. Et puis c'est tellement utilisé comme argument a pas cher c'en est devenu une phrase toute faite sans contenu utilisé par tous pour vendre n'importe quoi.

This is true, but European powers are far from innocent of this either. Your nation has been very active in overthrowing governments and shaping the course of other nations. So have many former imperial powers, including France. Would you still consider the UK and France imperialist?

I think that may be the disconnect. Both of us are using different definitions of imperialism. 

If the UK asked the US to leave, it would certainly cause tension, but I dont think there would be any economic reprisals. The next time the UK decided to get involved in a foreign intervention (think Libya) I would imagine the US would sit out instead of assist. 

I honestly think the US is much less afraid of the ""communist"" threat than it once was. It trades fairly freely with China and Vietnam. That was the reasoning for many of the interventions in the past. Now, Venezuela is largely left alone. Chavez's coup attempt was blamed on the CIA by him, but there is no evidence they were involved. It looks like it was a fairly home grown resistance. In the ""old days"" he would not have been allowed to hold power for so long. And it seems to have worked itself out naturally. His electorate are turning against him on their own.

Well do they? That's the question I have been asking.

The only fact you've mentioned to back your claim is that early child care is popular. This is flawed reasoning since the popularity of child care does not necessarily reflect what parents want. Instead, it may very easily reflect what they are *forced to* do to make the ends meet. Likewise, staying at home does not automatically translate to a preference, but may indicate ""a lack of quality in available child care.""

It's like taxes. The fact that 99% pay them does not mean that 99% of the population would prefer to do so, given a choice not to.

&gt; Different studies coming to different conclusions does not mean anything if the quality of the scientific method is not on the same level.

When I call America imperialist I am merely stating the facts as I see them I am not using it as an insult as someone from a post colonial nation might.

Important line right here.

Tsvetan Vasilev who is the guy in charge of the bank is called ""Putin's guy"". He used to be very close to Delyan Peevski, but they had a falling out during the protests last year when both their names were tarnished.

Vasilev started his own political project called Bulgaria without Censorship which got 10% of the EU votes and 2 MEPs. After that **Peevski, who owns BulgarTabac, stopped servicing his bank credits worth a lot of money**. The two have been using the media and state prosecution to attack each other for over a week now. They are linked to projects like South Stream and other which didn't work out well for them recently.

It is speculated that some oligarchs want to bring the bank down in order to default on their credits. Other go as far as to suggest that some oligarchs want to bring down the whole monetary board that pegs our Lev to the Euro in order to escape their loans like they did in 1997 which was the time of the so called ""Credit millionaires"".

&gt;Remettre la baisse de la croissance extraordinaire des pays civilisés post-WW2 à l'UE et l'Euro me paraît vraiment maladroit comme excuse.

Concernant l'euro, on peut comparer avec la situation en Suisse ou au Royaume-Uni. Les chiffres parlent d'eux-mêmes.

&gt;En fait ce qu'il faut savoir dans le monde néo-libéral actuel, c'est que l'interdépendance économique des pays fait qu'ils ne sont plus en guerre.

C'est complètement faux et très simple à réfuter : avant la 1ère et la 2nde guerre mondiale, la France et l'Allemagne étaient tous deux premier partenaire économique l'un de l'autre.

Ça n'a pas empêché deux guerres.

&gt;on remarquera que la grande majorité des gouvernements en guerre avaient tous des politiques intérieures très protectionnistes

Et ? La Chine et les US ont aujourd'hui des politiques protectionnistes.

Par contre, la guerre n'est plus possible militairement. On ne peut plus envahir un pays et gagner la guerre. Le Vietnam l'a montré, l'Afghanistan, l'Irak, la Lybie en sont d'autres exemples.

Entre puissances nucléaires, c'est encore moins possible. J'ai une citation du Général de Gaulle qui va bien d'ailleurs.

Ce sont des faits militaires bien concrets, rien à voir avec la possible influence d'une politique économique...

I would counter this by saying, removing barriers mostly helps small and medium sized businesses. Large corporations are very capable of doing business internationally.

Coca-Cola can easily afford the team of American, Irish, Dutch, and Cayman lawyers needed to make this work, a medium sized business, not so much. 

My friend tried opening an office in the EU, he eventually gave up and started a second company in the US. His company wasnt huge at the time, probably about $10MM in revenue, but he found the process overly bureaucratic and not straight forward. 

His second company employs several people making between $50 and $100K per year, which could have been EU jobs, but are now in California. 

Obviously my story is anecdotal, but it goes to show that the small and medium sized companies are the ones being left behind, not the large corporations. 6 of the top 10 companies in Ireland are American, which I think only drives the point home further.

true,BrotoriousNIG,UKGB,Republic of Lancashire,"&gt;They are intimately related. Cookie laws place additional restrictions on how HTTP protocol should be used inside EU.

The cookie law doesn't specify how to use cookies, nor does it deal with any part of the HTTP protocol.  It doesn't say don't do anything, nor does it say ""use HTTP this way"".  It doesn't say ""you're not allowed to set cookies anymore""; it says ""tell people what cookies are and why you're using them, when you use them"".

This makes the analogy far from perfect.

&gt;it is as if EU outlawed looting in Minecaft (because of few butthurt teenagers) even though the designer envisioned looting to be a valid interaction and within parameters of the game

The EU is not outlawing cookies because of some bad actors.  It is saying that websites are to tell users that they're using cookies and what for.  A closer analogy would be if the EU said to Mojang et al ""if your game contains the ability for players to have their things taken by other users when they die, you must tell them when they go to buy the game"", but the analogy still isn't perfect, because 'looting' is a real-world term used to mean the same thing and people who play games could be expected to expect that looting of your stuff, or losing it outright, when you die is a thing that happens.  The problem with cookies is that they have no user metaphor to assist the user in understanding what they are from the term itself and you would not expect someone who browses websites, but is not a technical person, to expect that the website stores data on your computer in order to track sessions.

&gt;But the user already agreed to the use of HTTP as it is when they installed their browser. 

No they didn't.  The average user has no idea what HTTP is, and is not presented with anything about HTTP when they install their browser.  This isn't a EULA thing; this is a transparent feature thing.

&gt;It also gives competitive advantage to Americans because they don't have to display spammy messages that scare people away

Dans un accord de libre échange, le pays avec les conditions sociales, les conditions de travail, les niveaux d'impositions les plus bas, s'en sort le mieux.

Un deuxième effet des accords de libre échange, est de diminuer le rapport de force syndicats-travailleurs/patronat.

true,Gehalgod,advanced-other,DE--&gt;EN Translation Student,"It's hard to summarize the functions of those words in just a few sentences, particularly ""doch"".

As a non-native speaker, I've had to strive to understand the usages of these words. I can share some insight with you:

---

**doch**

I think of *doch* as meaning *yet* or *though*, but it's hard to explain. You can use it to answer negative questions positively, like this:

""Sprichst du kein English?""

""Ja"" (It is true that I speak *no English*)

""Nein"" (I don't speak English)

""Doch"" (On the contrary, I *do* speak English)

It's also used in places where English speakers would add the helping verb *do* for emphasis.

""I *do* know what his name is!"" = ""Ich weiß doch, wie er heißt!""

More info here: http://german.about.com/library/weekly/aa010806b.htm

---

**mal**

This is said to be short for *einmal*, which means *once*, although this idea is challenged here: http://yourdailygerman.wordpress.com/2013/04/08/meaning-mal/

and here: http://yourdailygerman.wordpress.com/2013/04/11/meaning-mal-german-2/

The word *mal* can be used to soften a command.

The phrase ""auch mal"" means ""once in a while"", and ""mal"" by itself can be used to express a casual feeling of the speaker's, as if it were only important to him that what he is describing happens at some point. 

The example from the page I linked was ""Ich will mal nach Kanada"".

Sometimes *mal* makes it clear that the statement is a request/order rather than a mere question.

""Könnten Sie mir sagen, wie ich zur Post komme?"" = ""Could you tell me how to get to the post office?""

The answer to this might be ""Yes"" instead of actual directions. Adding ""mal"" to get ""Könnten Sie mir **mal** sagen..."" makes it clearer that it is a command.

---

**noch**

This means *yet*, *still*, *in addition* ... ""Ich möchte noch ein Bier, bitte."" = ""I would like another beer, please"". The typical way to say *another* is to add *noch* before the noun phrase in German.

It also means *even* in the sense of ""even [comparative adjective] than _____"".

Something like ""She is running even faster now than before"" might be ""Sie läuft jetzt noch schneller als zuvor"".

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt;Americans refuse to regulate their financial sector

London especially is making sure EU reforms are as weak as possible. People talk about US banks being ""too big to fail"" but fail to realize European banks are absolutely *massive*. [Five of the world's 10 largest banks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_banks) are European. They're only getting larger. Most banking mergers and acquisitions are not in the developing world where you might think, but in Europe. A whopping 62% of all global bank mergers are in the EU thanks to the one passport system. The presumption is if both banks are chartered in the EU, the merger is allowed. I am not an expert on EU anti-trust, but would assume they are bound by anti-trust regulations but that is about it. As I said, the numbers speak for themselves. A very large majority of all global banking mergers and acquisitions take place within the EU, so these massive institutions are only getting larger.

The City definitely is where bad money goes to play. American banks do most of their international lending out of London. There is far less regulatory oversight. My professor for ""International Banking and Finance Law"" (Masters of Law course), worked for a Chicago based bank, was licensed to practice law in several US states, but spent most of his time working for the London branch (he worked in international lending and syndicated loans). He even said ""London is an old boys club if one ever existed.""

US securities laws are some of the most strict (probably the most) in the world. There were some holes, for instance debt backed securities, but for the most part US securities markets are very regulated. Europe has thresholds that allow a company to avoid disclosure for an issuance. So companies simply structure each offering so they effectively have to disclose very little or nothing material at all. Contrast this to the US where every ""material"" fact must be disclosed or the company can be sued. New European regulations were originally much more in line with SEC rules, but the UK got their hands on them (and other countries with large financial sectors). Now its very easy to avoid disclosure, which is not the case with an SEC offering. SEC rules aside there is an incentive to over-disclose in the US because shareholders have the right to sue an issuer if they make a material misstatement or material omission. This is not the case in Europe, and even less now with these new watered down rules.

This is only securities. Dont even get me started on relaxed banking regulations now that regulatory authority is being centralized. A new single regulator is still in the works, so lets hope they dont let London and other financial centers screw around with its authorities too much (they are trying).

This new regulator can be a very productive endeavor, but if it is too watered down it could be fairly destructive. Given the two largest banks in France *each* have assets equal to the entire annual GDP of France, European banks are truly ""too big to fail"". Just two French banks have 200% of France's annual GDP in assets. That was one of the reasons France was downgraded. Because their banks had such high exposure to toxic European sovereign debt (Greece, etc) and ratings agencies anticipated government intervention in the case of another crisis.

A strong regulator would be great, but given the past exercise in centralization, I am not sure that is what we will see. Given the amount of deregulation already, I worry about how countries would go about bailing out institutions that eclipse their own national economies, at least in terms of total assets (although keep in mind not *all* assets would become worthless, but if enough did at once, like in 2008 in the US, it could cause a pretty catastrophic crisis). It could end up being like an Iceland crisis, except without other countries to dump the financial burden on.

This does not even get into problems of banks having monopolies in other countries. For instance much of the burden for a financial crisis in Latvia fell on Swedish banks and the Swedish government.

Sorry for rambling, but it such an in depth issue, it could be discussed almost indefinitely.

1. Per quanto adori l'Optima come carattere tipografico, questa mescolanza di Arial e Optima non mi convince. I tipografi in genere suggeriscono di usare un carattere senza serif e uno con, da usare per titolazione e corpo del testo.  
Io personalmente farei tutto in Arial, e solo il titolo (""/r/italy"") e la lista per mettere in ordine i link (""hot new top…"") con un carattere coi serif (Palatino o, nel peggiore dei casi, Georgia, ché tutti l'hanno installato). Il resto lo lascerei in Arial, o addirittura in Verdana, il default di Reddit (di cui si può dire tanto male, ma cazzo se si legge bene su un monitor).  
Se proprio vogliamo lasciare l'abbinata Optima+Arial, usiamola con coerenza. Le componenti della pagina sembrano essere state assegnate a caso ai due caratteri tipografici.

2. Personalmente non mi piace quel ""subscribe now"" che fa cucù quando si scrolla la pagina, ma magari a qualcun altro sì.

3. Non vedo l'utilità di nascondere i post tool (""share save hide report"") finché non si fa hover su di loro. Non è però un grosso problema, se non per il fatto che quando RES aggiunge altri pulsanti (per esempio ""[l+c]"", aggiunto dal modulo ""Single Click Opener"") [essi non scompaiono e rimangono a fluttuare nel vuoto](http://i.imgur.com/a0iKaxv.png).  
E comunque il fatto che lo stesso non accada con i comment tool mi dà un'aria di incoerenza.

true,Bellygareth,shrek,Shrek,"&gt; Avant on avait l'instabilité de la 4ème. Et de Gaulle a amplement donné du pouvoir au peuple par l'organisation de référendums. Il se méfiait à juste titre du clientélisme des partis politiques, on voit ce que ça donne aujourd'hui...

&gt;Tu proposes quoi ?

L'abandon d'un Senat élu aux grands électeurs, l'obligation d'appel au référendum, la proportionelle pourquoi pas ca serait déjà pas mal. Dans les faits son système est trop axé président et même s'il souhaitait que le président soit juste un symbole de représentation, il se trouve qu'en réalité la majorité présidentielle est autonome et ne suit pas forcément la volonté du peuple et peux s'en passer sans pb.

&gt; C'est à dire ?

&gt;On oublie souvent de dire que mai 68 n'a pas été cette révolution manquée qu'on nous survend. Mai 68 c'est que dalle, la plus grande manif de mai 68 c'est celle du 30 mai avec un million de parisiens qui défilent en soutien à de Gaulle. Les élections qui suivent verront un raz-de-marrée gaulliste.

Comme l'a montré le résultat du référendum sur lequel il a misé justement sur ce soutiens. Ou pas.

&gt; Après si tu as d'autres exemples, je suis preneur. En termes de gestion de crise, il y a quand même l'Algérie, la décolonisation (remplacée par le système moins coûteux de Françafrique).

C'est curieux qu'en tant que membre du FN tu mentionne l'Algérie vu ce qu'en pense Marine. 
Pour les autres exemples partons de celle de 1958, De Gaulle organise une prise de pouvoir par la force militaire.... Même réponse lors de l'indépendance de la Syrie en 45. 

&gt;  Il n'a pas bien géré ou vu venir les problèmes liés au baby boom.

Par exemple l'augmentation du nombre de chomeurs lié a la démographie, qui apparait justement proche de 68, et qui conduit a la création de l'ANPE. Surpopulation des écoles qui pourtant n'est pas encore suffisamment démocratisée. Bref les origines de mai 68. La réponse de De Gaulle aux critiques? Il s'énerve et dénonce la Chienlit. OK.

&gt; Une France indépendante en effet les US et le Royaume-Uni n'aiment pas trop ça... C'est quoi le problème avec ""Vive le Québec libre"" ?

Il y a mieux en terme de Diplomatie internationale, non? 

&gt; Les ""alliés"" ont toujours été contre lui, rappelle toi qu'ils voulaient Giraud pendant la 2nde guerre, et qu'ils voulaient installer un nouveau gouvernement d'occupation sous la botte des US. Et il ne s'est pas mis à dos la Russie, ou alors montre le.

Je pense notamment aux faible succès de la politique de ""rapprochement"", qui n'a pas eut d'effet réel. La france reste au départ de De Gaulle un partenaire moins important que l'Angleterre (bastion du communisme bien connu).

&gt; Jamais prononcé dans un contexte civil. Il y répond d'ailleurs ici.

Reste qu'en terme de politique économique il a changé plusieurs fois de stratégie. et qu'il est difficile de l'associer a tel ou tel modèle. C'est le sens de ce que je dit.

&gt; En quoi ?

En quoi est-on suffisamment équivalent serait une meilleure question. Le tissu économique social et les relations internationales sont différentes. 

&gt; Oui donc en fait tu ne sais pas ce dont tu parles...

&gt; Le gaullisme, c'est avant tout une politique d'indépendance et de grandeur de la France. Quand on dit non à la guerre en Irak, ou si on accueillait Snowden par exemple.

Oui et donc en fait dans cet article on parle de politique d'indépendance et Fillon propose d'accueillir Snowden. Tu vois bien que c'est utilisé pour dire n'importe quoi...

What is democratic about one man having supreme rule over the entire means of production?

If you want to know what a socialist company looks like have a look at (particularly) The Co-Operative in the UK. A fairly successful company with its own bank that elect their CEOs as well as provide forums for any employee to raise concerns. 

The ethics come into play as people vote against investing in arms deals and they were the first UK company selling white goods that declared a minimum power saving features to be more environmentally friendly yada yada.

That's all it is. Being so you'd imagine a society that has democratic saybin almost every facet (especially big business) would be a more highly desired society to live in.

So back to NK.

The workers have no democratic say in the labour camps they work for. I assure they would've voted to stop the torture by now.

So the best NK is a dictatorship and a totalitarian state. In terms of the economy its managed by the few higher ups with close ties to the military. The economy and means of production is in the hands of a severely limited number of people and they utilise that for their own (capitalist) profit.

true,IntelligentNickname,SWED,Sweden,"This article is stupid as hell and has already been discussed, or rather laughed at in /r/Sweden. But just for fun, let's debunk it

&gt; Last month, I went to Stockholm on a reporting trip. The city seemed idyllic: bicycles aplenty standing unlocked outside at night, Volvos with their doors open and engines running, and not a cigarette butt in sight. **In trendy Hornstull, bearded bros high-fived each other over Brooklyn craft beers.**

So stereotypical, don't you think? There is no way this happend.

&gt; But everyone, it seemed, was white.

They write, like it's something wrong with that.

&gt; “They live in the suburbs, at the end of the blue metro line,” Karl informed me, adjusting his sunglasses in the dimly lit bar. “Don’t go there now, though, it's pretty dangerous. They’re pretty angry, and it's nighttime; black people get pretty angry when there’s no sun.”

&gt; “Don’t you think that’s pretty racist?” I asked. Karl hesitated for a moment, shooting a look at his drinking companion before removing his Ray-Bans and turning back to me. “I’m not racist,” he said. “I’m Swedish.”

Did they seriously writing an article and have this bullshit included? Every word lacks reality.

&gt; The rise of the far right, and the entrance of the Sweden Democrats into Sweden’s parliament, have created a space to further isolate those who don’t look “Swedish.”

Really now? Why does this seem like utter bullshit?

&gt; Recent statistics show a large increase in hate crimes against Muslims, Jews, African-born residents and the Roma community.

This one might be true, but is it really goebells and his gang who are back? Jews are harassed almost exclusively by muslims, and muslims by syrians. But brå states this: ""Compared to previous years the level of victimization of xenophobic and homophobic hate crimes can be viewed as relatively stable."" and ""Of little less than the estimated 3,980 xenophobic/racist hate crimes in 2012, 940 were considered to be Afrophobic and almost 220 anti-Roma. Additionally, homo-, bi- and heterophobic motives were identified in just over 710 reports, Islamophobic in little more than 300, christianophobic or anti-religious in almost 260, anti-Semitic in just over 220 and transphobic in just over 40 reports. "" so I call bullshit on this one aswell. It's kind of funny that the writer never included homophobia or christianophobia, but whatever, it's not like this article is biased or something.

&gt; Regularly overlooked in Sweden’s history is its role in the slave trade and colonialism.

Lol. We had like 20 ships during the entirety of slave trade and we had a colony in current America which was taken over by the dutch after like 10 years. When you mention slaves in the Swedish history you refer to trälar, or thralls, which were white. They were abused far more than african slaves but yet when these type of articles come up they never once mention it.

&gt; Under King Gustav III, Sweden held colonies such as Saint Barthélemy in the Caribbean and profited directly from the slaves who were imported onto the island and then sold to French colonies and elsewhere in the Caribbean.

[Come on, Sweden was very critical and defended the rights of slaves.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_slave_trade) It's so annoying that you bring up and angle the few negative sides Sweden had when we did so much more good.

&gt; More recently, in 1922, the country was the first to establish a National Institute of Racial Biology at Uppsala University to measure the racial makeup of the population and the size of people's heads in a vain **attempt to learn about hereditary illnesses.**

Err.... Sure Sweden has a dark spot in history of racial biology, we don't deny that. But we didn't use the racial biology centres to sort out non-white people. We used them to learn about diseases.

&gt; This institute was associated with a eugenics movement network that “may have been relatively small but it was nevertheless historically significant,” writes Maria Björkman of Linköping University, “because of its intimate ties with that part of the German eugenics movement that would shape Nazi biopolitics.”

That was the bad part yes.

&gt; The same year, the minister of culture displayed outrageous ignorance by cutting into a cake depicting a racist caricature in an attempt to highlight female genital mutilation.

Lol. The artist herself was black and insisted on the minster of culture to cut her (the cake) to make a stand against female genital mutilation.

&gt; However, Sweden stands out for its disproportionate number of European Union asylum applications. In 2012 the country received 13 percent of the EU’s total applications. There are an additional 695,775 citizens who have one foreign-born and one native Swedish parent; there are also those 467,697 Swedes born to two foreign-born parents. In fact, the portion of Sweden’s population whom those politicians see as “other” is closer to 28 percent.

The government doesn't want to say that the ""others"" are immigrants, so instead they clump them up as ""others"". The fact that the article writer is criticising this is hilarious.

&gt; Much to the surprise of the world’s media, these “others” rioted last year in suburban Husby.

So they want them to say that these ""others"" were immigrants from the middle east? Go ahead.

&gt; For one, Swedish cities are segregated by design. The well-meaning “Million Program” of the 1960s and ’70s, which set out to build affordable housing developments across the country, was ambitious and well intentioned. However, it concentrated low-income rental properties in faraway and inconvenient suburbs, which began the fragmentation of Swedish society.

The million programme was a success at first but it has segrigated a lot. Poor people seek themselves to cheap housing.

&gt; Those arriving from abroad in the ’70s could afford only to move into these distinctive Million Program rentals, while the white middle and upper classes moved into cooperative housing or bought houses outright in the “Swedish-looking” accommodation mainly situated in the centers.

Not really true. A lot of workers who immigrated during the 70s doesn't really live in million programme house complexes. Mostly there are asylum seekers and grant takers live in these buildings.

&gt; Take Tensta, a suburb that was part of the Million Program: It lies on the northern edge of Stockholm’s metro map, buried deep underground. In order to get there from the central station, one has to walk down three escalators, to the deepest section of the city’s main metro station where the blue line runs north. Here we see another, more complete Sweden of different colors and communities.

There are plenty of Swedes living on the blue line. Are they going to call it racist that Swedish subway systems are designed that you need to take 3 stairs?

&gt; In Tensta and other suburbs, children go to schools whose student body is composed of 90 percent first- or second-generation immigrants. I visited a local school called Tensta Gymnasium, which prides itself on its immigrant-heavy student body. I asked if attracting blond-haired and blue-eyed Swedish schoolchildren to Tensta Gymnasium might aid integration, to which principal Sofie Abrahamsson replied, “Why should we put money into attracting those from elsewhere, when we know they won’t come?”

Because there is a lot of crime and hostility in these areas, very few Swedes wish to live there. Some do because some Swedes are still poor.

&gt; Abrahamsson’s resigned attitude makes sense. Outside the archipelago of immigrant islands such as Tensta, Rinkeby, Alby and Husby, racism and Islamophobia are commonplace.

Homophobia is more common than islamophobia, but that isn't on the list somehow. Also Swedes are very tolerant about homosexuals, so saying islamophobia is a bigger issue is laughable.

&gt; Social media have provided a small ray of hope, with Instagram accounts such as Svartkvinna (Black woman) and Muslimskvinna (Muslim woman) offering a platform for those “others” to articulate their stories.

A lot of these medias and forums are racist towards Swedes and whites, but somehow that is deemed ""acceptable"".

&gt; Toward the end of my stay in Sweden, I sat on a bench in Tensta’s main square. People talked to each other outside the bustling Iraqi-run market. A Syrian asylum seeker tried to sell me a pack of dodgy cigarettes before asking about my family. There was a sense of community in the suburbs that I didn’t experience in the center of the city.

Well duh.

The problems in the Swedish society about immigration and integration are because of the government. I also would like to point out that this article is biased as fuck.

&gt; Il Corriere nel pezzo a firma di Marta Serafini scrive: ""Incontro Pd-M5S, c'è Renzi Il premier boccia il Democratellum"". Non è vero. Non c'è stata nessuna bocciatura. Renzi si è detto interessato a trovare un punto d'incontro con il Movimento 5 Stelle, e non ha bocciato il Democratellum. Il premier ha detto che la legge proposta dai 5 Stelle è ""molto interessante, ma gravemente deficitaria per la governabilità"". Non è proprio la stessa cosa.

&gt;Ma andiamo avanti. Il Corriere ha poi aggiunto nel sottotitolo dell'articolo: Il segretario del Pd a Di Maio: «La vostra legge non garantisce governabilità». Non c'è Grillo. E sul blog il leader del M5S: «Insulti alla Boschi? Si rivolga alla Polizia Postale».

&gt;Come potete notare non vi è alcun riferimento alle parole di Luigi Di Maio o ai discorsi fatti da Toninelli. E' sempre il premier Renzi ad incalzare baldanzoso: «La vostra legge non garantisce governabilità», tuona la giornalista nel suo sottotitolo. Poi c'è chicca finale, ed è davvero incredibile: «Insulti alla Boschi? Si rivolga alla Polizia Postale». Ma Grillo non ha mai detto una cosa simile. Dove l'ha pescata la giornalista?

&gt;Leggiamo cosa ha scritto Grillo sul suo Blog: ""sono a disposizione del ministro Boschi qualora volesse attivare la polizia postale per giungere alla loro identità e agire per vie legali in tutela della sua reputazione"". Vi sembra la stessa cosa? E' davvero una vergogna.

They really don't. They have half the GDP we do, nowhere near our level of development, and nowhere near our level of global military and economic reach. Like I said, they may very well surpass us, but simply have not done so yet.

Yes, I know this, just like everyone else on this forum dedicated to discussing Europe. I was using the term ""Europe"" informally to mean the EU and a potential federalized version of the EU in the future.

What is veiled as a socialist, working man's paradise is really a bloodthirsty, domineering, totalitarian hellhole.

We have North Korea to thank for why 'socialism' or 'communism' are such dirty words.

The worst part is North Korea is as socialist as the sky is green.

Socialism states that: the means of production, the distribution of goods and services, exchange of said goods and services, should all be undertaken by the community rather than individuals.

To add, a core tenet of socialism is that there should be no class distinction whatsoever.

Also, one would expect that a truly socialist country would be very, very ideal to live in. Plentiful food, excellent wages, no upper class or class struggle, great health care, minimum homelessness or unemployment, a thriving science community, great working conditions, a lack of child labor, so on and so forth.

North Korea has none of these things.

North Korea is in short 'social imperialist', or ""socialist by name, imperalist in practice"".

It was very common in the 20th Century for countries to undergo socialist revolutions on the pretense of worker empowerment, freedom, improved economy, and the like.

Once the revolution had been carried out, the upper class of the previous government was replaced by a new upper class, very often the leaders of the revolution.

The USSR, Cuba, North Korea, China, and others all made these claims and simply carried on the former government under renamed positions, further concentration of power into fewer individuals, tightened censorship further still so as to safeguard their power and maintain the image of a very progressive and economically sound country.

You may say: All those countries can't be capitalist because there are no private companies or even ownership there.

While you are correct, this is a double sided sword. In social imperialist countries, while private companies or ownership don't exist, the economy is still thoroughly capitalist.

Centralized management, certain people being favored in terms of wage distribution over others, an overall gap between worker and employer, all still exist.

Sure, there is no private enterprise with it's own name in North Korea or any other listed place above, they were still capitalist.

And the point of appearing socialist was simply to safeguard power in an identical position under a different name. The ""Czar"" became the ""General Secretary"". The ""President"" became ""Honorable Chairman"".

North Korea was obviously a failure, that is to say if it was ever a goal to raise the standard of living for anyone who wasn't governing the state.

It was obvious that a Marxist-Leninist (a disgrace to the Marx name) revolution would be widely accepted in the area. Why shouldn't it have been?

For decades, the Korean Peninsula played a minimum role in the world. At best, Korea served as a path for soldiers from better-off countries to take en route to a front of war. There was constant rape, pillaging, damage, and overall disrespect from passing armies.

So, it was no wonder those in the North would embrace the revolution entirely. NOW they would be important. NOW they would be economically stable.

They had no idea what death contract they had signed.

I'll admit that by mid-to-late 1950 North Korea had captured a fair amount of the peninsula, though it was all a waste in retrospect and the poor saps can't legally know any better.

North Korea, if you didn't know already, is a horrible place to live. Food and water are scarce; only the military, statues and the ruling class are ever invested in; child labor is common; freedom of expression or even personality or individuality is illegal; the only emotions are hate, fear and pride; technology, science and medicine froze some 50 years ago; there is no education, only indoctrination; and privacy is a thing of the past.

I've also got this theory that North Korea is always egging on South Korea for war just enough so battle is avoided, yet the North remains untouched.

This way, the North Koreans feel invincible at the thought the South refuses to engage in combat.

Just a thought.

&gt;Io: Come mai tua figlia non sta con te?

&gt;L.: Lei sta con i miei genitori. Io non sono capace di fare la mamma.

&gt;Io: Perché?

&gt;L.: Non so cucinare, non so fare niente.

Spiegazione: Molti bambini crescono principalmente coi nonni paterni. Quando una coppia si sposa, i genitori di lui vanno a vivere con loro (nelle grandi città sta sparendo, ma nel restante 99% della Cina è ancora così). Siccome nelle coppie cinesi lavorano entrambi i coniugi, sono i nonni a occuparsi dei nipoti. A questo si aggiunge la frase fatta ""i nonni sono più saggi, possono educare i nipoti meglio di quanto non possano fare i genitori"". In questo caso non so perchè stiano con i nonni materni, dal momento che in genere sono praticamente esclusi dalla vita familiare: vengono chiamati ""外婆” e ""外公“ (nonna esterna/nonno esterno). Ma la cosa non mi stupisce più di tanto: molte coppie divorziano subito, o il padre viene trasferito per lavoro dall'altra parte del paese, quindi non può stare insieme con la famiglia; di conseguenza, i nonni materni subentrano nel ruolo di educatori dei nipoti.
 
&gt;L.: Mio paese vicinovicinovicino Shangai. Cinque ore di macchina e una in aereo.

Per i cinesi 5-6 ore di viaggio non sono niente. E non può che essere così, considerando che le distanze sono enormi. Ricordo ancora le 48 ore di treno Pechino-Lhasa.

&gt;L.: Ma a voi italiani piace il numero 9?

&gt;Io: Mmmm.. Non mi sembra. Perché?

&gt;L.: Perché io vedo sempre i prezzi 19,99 24,90… Pensavo che portasse fortuna in Italia!

Per loro il numero più fortunato di tutti è il 168, le cui cifre singole si pronunciano ""Yi Liu Ba"" (一六八), che suonano come “Yi lu fa [cai]"" 一路发[财] che è un augurio di fare fortuna. In Cina, quando si tratta sul prezzo, è bene tenere conto anche dei numeri: se un oggetto costa tanto, e chiedi uno sconto o tratti sul prezzo con il cinese, se ti dice una cifra che termina in 68 significa che è l'ultima offerta disposto ad accettare. Esempio: questo oggetto costa 200? Voglio pagare massimo 150 e cerco di trattare con il venditore? Lui mi dice 168? E' la sua ultima offerta. Tentare di scendere ulteriormente è un segno di maleducazione, oltre che portare sfiga.

I cinesi sono superstiziosi, quindi i prezzi hanno molti 6 e molti 8. I numeri di telefono delle aziende grandi, che quindi spendono per un numero così, spesso sono composti da una dozzina di 8. Tutti 8.  

&gt;Io: Perché i cinesi adesso assumono persone italiane?

&gt;L.: Perché gli italiani sono più gentili. Voi dite sempre ‘Grazie’, ‘Buongiorno’… Noi sorridiamo e basta.

Sì, noi siamo il popolo più aperto di tutti quando siamo all'estero e ci relazioniamo con gli altri. Peccato che tra noi siamo stronzi da morire.

&gt;L.: Mio fratello..

&gt;Io: Ah hai anche un fratello?

&gt;L.: No, fratello di mio marito è come se fosse anche mio fratello.

&gt;Io: E come si chiama?

&gt; L.: Io lo chiamo Scimmia

&gt; Io: *rido*

&gt; L.: Perché ridi?

&gt; Io: Scimmia? Perché Scimmia?

&gt; L.: *serissima* Perché assomiglia a scimmia. Se mio amico assomiglia a maiale io chiamo lui Maiale, no?

Questo è un lato dei cinesi con cui è difficile imparare a convivere: entrano in confidenza totale con le persone che gli stanno attorno (non se sono occidentali, per quello ci vuole un po' più di tempo), e si permettono soprannomi e scenate che difficilmente un occidentale riterrebbe accettabili. Per quanto riguarda i soprannomi, chiamare qualcuno ""scimmia"" o ""maiale"" non è offensivo, la scimmia è simbolo di saggezza (oltre ad essere un segno dell'oroscopo cinese tanto quanto il maiale). Io sono alto quasi 2 metri, e le battute e i nomignoli si sprecano. La gente si ferma per strada, mi guarda, e mi dice ad alta voce ""这么高的老外！” (""che spilungone di straniero!"").

&gt; L.: Perché in Africa tutti poveri?

&gt;Io: Ehm… Perché non hanno soldi, non hanno niente. Fa anche tanto caldo quindi è difficile coltivare…

&gt;L.: Allora perché non vanno tutti via?

La logica dei cinesi è ineccepibile.

&gt; L.: Hai fame?

&gt; Io: No. Tu?

&gt; L.: Sì.

&gt; Io: Allora andiamo a mangiare qualcosa.

&gt; L.: Ma io non posso mangiare da sola se tu non mangi.

In Cina, chiedere a una persona se ha fame, o più in generale chiedere se ha mangiato, è sinonimo di interesse verso la salute di quella persona. Se la risposta è ""no, non ho mangiato"" o ""sì, ho fame"", la buona educazione pretende che la persona che ha posto la domanda inviti l'altra persona a mangiare e paghi anche il conto. E l'altra persona dovrà sdebitarsi con lui, alla prossima occasione, chiaramente. La domanda 你吃饭了没有？ (hai mangiato?) equivale a chiedere ""come stai"", e non sempre è necessaria una risposta. Esempio: un buon sostituto della domanda sul cibo, è la domanda/affermazione ""sei impegnato"", che equivale a dire ""ti ho notato, vorrei salutarti e parlare con te, ma vedo che sei impegnato quindi non ti disturbo parlandoti ma ti dico che 'sei impegnato' per farti capire che se non fossi stato impegnato ti avrei salutato e avrei scambiato due parole con te"". All'Università non potevo studiare in biblioteca per questo motivo: ogni tot appariva qualcuno che conoscevo che mi diceva ""还忙啊！"". In questo caso, lei voleva mangiare con lui, probabilmente, e voleva pagare lei. Ma siccome ha detto di ""no"", lei non può mangiare davanti a lui. Deve cercarsi qualcun altro con cui mangiare.

&gt; Io: Ma voi come trovate sempre lavoro?

&gt; L.: Su internet c’è un sito dove ci sono tutti i lavori e i numeri di telefono. Tu chiami e chiedi che lavoro è, quante ore, quanto paga. Poi decidi se ti piace o no. Se non ti piace chiami un altro e chiedi. Se lontano da casa tua allora capo ti dà una casa dove vivere e paga il cibo. Tu scegli quello che ti piace di più. Uguale Italia, no?

Quando stavo là, se mandavo un curriculum a un'azienda per un colloquio, il tempo medio di risposta era 2 ore. Anche per dirmi ""no, grazie, abbiamo già provveduto"".

&gt; L.: Mio amico aveva un ristorante e polizia faceva sempre i controlli e gli dava una multa. Quando lui ha chiesto perché, anche se era tutto pulito, loro hanno detto “Perché cinesi pagano sempre multe subito”.

Non so che dire, non ho esperienza di multe ai cinesi.

&gt; Io: Dammi il cinque!

da un paio d'anni è stata introdotta la raccolta differenziata dell'umido, solo in alcuni quartieri organizzata nel seguente modo: via tutti i cassonetti indifferenziati e la spazzatura si consegna solo la mattina (2-3 ore) al ""punto di raccolta"" più vicino.
 Risultato: le vecchine(ma non solo) abituate a buttare la spazzatura sotto casa non hanno digerito il fatto di doversi fare 200 metri per smaltire i rifiuti, e hanno iniziato a buttare l'immondizia per strada vicino agli altri cassonetti di differenziata (plastica e carta).
Conseguenza: in pochi mesi il mio quartiere (portuense/marconi) si è riempito di toponi che preparano le ratatuille, ma pure la parmigiana volendo. 

Per fortuna 2 settimane dopo l'elezione del sindaco Marino, questo incubo del punto di raccolta è stato eliminato e sono stati rimessi i classici secchi per la differenziata. tuttavia sono stati messi un po' qui e un po' là, e sono insufficienti, quindi quando vuoi buttare qualcosa devi andare in cerca del secchione libero, perchè ogni punto serve 4-5 palazzoni da centinaia di famiglie (che bella l'edilizia popolare ...). 

in conclusione: spesso sono costretta ad abbandonare il sacchetto pazientemente differenziato per strada perchè strabordano tutti, o a fare il giro del quartiere a piedi.

Per questo ti ho chiesto la fonte (perché era chiaro che parlavi per luoghi comuni) e anche ciò che mi hai linkato tu lo smentisce: Esposito e gli altri facevano parte di un gruppetto che è stato provocato da De Santis e si stavano dirigendo allo stadio, poi il fatto che coloro che rispondono alla provocazione non sono persone particolarmente pacifiche esula dal mio discorso: non ho intenzione di santificare nessuno.

However, the latter does tend to favor older, famous scandals over just emerging ones. 

As an interesting example of the quantification of media exposure is the GDELT project where they try to ascertain the extent, severity, impact and so on of protests and violent attacks throughout the world (politically motivated attacks; i.e. non-state actors such as terrorists, militias, and state led attacks).

There's the link for you to check it out. Also on the less science end of the spectrum you have something like Noam Chomsky's ""Manufacturing Consent"" where he tries to show the manipulation of media for certain end goals based on the exposure given to concurrent events. One example he provides is the Nicaraguan/Guatemalan Rebels/Wars/Sandinistas/Contras and so on vs. articles relating Pope John Paul II at the same time (I believe arolund the time of the attempted assassination). However, using Chomsky in political science or using him as trustworthy source is problematic in its own right, but I digress.

Les artistes de La bande à Renaud témoignent de façon contradictoire sur son implication : certains n'ont eu aucun contact avec lui (ce que disent Carla Bruni et Raphaël), d'autres l'ont seulement vu. L'explication de cette opération est sans doute donnée dans un article du Plus du Nouvel Obs : « Universal a racheté EMI il y a quelques années. Or, Renaud était sous contrat avec EMI... à qui il devait encore deux disques (…) Renaud n’a rien sorti. Il n’avait donc pas honoré son contrat. Et là, sort ""La Bande à Renaud"" sous le label Mercury, propriété d’Universal. En plus, un volume 2 pourrait suivre en cas de succès du volume 1. Avec ces deux albums, le contrat serait rempli ». Renaud, retiré dans sa maison de l'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, ne trouve manifestement plus l'inspiration pour des chansons inédites, et, quand bien même, il n'aurait peut-être pas la capacité vocale de les chanter.

&gt; Europe has thresholds that allow a company to avoid disclosure for an issuance. So companies simply structure each offering so they effectively have to disclose very little or nothing material at all. 

This really isn't true. Europe has thresholds for disclosure for issuances, but not for listing securites on a regulated market. So, generally, there is no way round the rules and most offerings get full disclosure.

&gt; SEC rules aside there is an incentive to over-disclose in the US because shareholders have the right to sue an issuer if they make a material misstatement or material omission. This is not the case in Europe, and even less now with these new watered down rules.

This is not true. For example, in the UK there is a right to sue for misrepresentation or negligent mistatement under the common law as well as various statutory causes of action. There are rights to sue across the EU. ",0,1403726925,null,0,1403727119,0,cigyscm,t3_291t87,t1_cigyscm,t1_cigvka5,null,1434401787,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I think we were arguing at cross purposes. We both accept there's an effect both ways. I was just saying the ""three million jobs at risk"" number doesn't acknowledge that. To be honest, the UK runs a deficit with the EU, so it's actually likely the UK would be slightly better off if trade dropped. Having said that, I think we'd have an FTA so it wouldn't change anyway.


&gt; We don't dictate everything and Cameron isolating himself didn't help. We have friends in Europe who oppose further federalisation such as the Netherlands and Sweden but we need to work with them to counter balance France and Germany.

But the Netherlands and Sweden have tiny populations. Them plus the UK will never come close to opposing France + Germany + their allies.

true,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"&gt; Towns off the beaten path- small towns that are worth traveling to for a day or two. I'm really interested in the countryside and hiking and eating as much stinky cheese as possible.

Oh, if only you could have been here a couple of weeks ago, I could have introduced you to our village's stinky cheese festival. (I'm not kidding, we really do have a stinky cheese festival.)

&gt; What events are going on in January that a tourist like me should attend?

Well, if you're interested in food and drink, the [Green Week](http://www.gruenewoche.de/en/) (Grüne Woche) is on in Berlin every January.

&gt; I'm REALLY into German electronic music and electronic music in general so I want to check out as many quality clubs as possible.

Back in the day when techno was the next big thing, the place to be was the small venue in Berlin's Kreuzberg district called SO36. I think it's still going, but it's probably changed beyond all recognition.

Obviously the thing to do is to get a local listings magazine, unless the language barrier is going to be a problem. The listings magazine for Berlin is ""zitty"" and is available at all newsagents.

&gt; Weather

In January, expect frost and possibly some snow. If it rains, it will be nastily cold rain. Also remember that Germany is further north than you might think, so the days will be *very* short: it will be dark by 4 pm.

&gt; Art- museums worth checking out, any and all!

A lot of Frankfurt's museums are concentrated on the south bank of the river, opposite the main centre (""Museumsufer"" = ""Museum Embankment"").

In Berlin, there are two main concentrations of museums and galleries. In the east is Museum Island, which includes the Pergamon Museum (especially recommended if you're interested in the art and history of the Biblical period, which is quite stunning); in the west is the Kulturforum, which includes the New National Gallery. But Berlin is bursting with small, contemporary galleries and museums.

&gt; Outlet adapters?

Yes, an absolute must.

&gt; My iPhone?

Yes.

&gt; Laptop versus a tablet?

Your choice. A tablet is probably easier to use on the plane.

&gt; Getting a prepaid phone while I'm there?

Unless you're expecting to make and receive a lot of calls within Germany, this might not save you any money.

&gt; Any items that you would recommend for traveling in your country.

Phone chargers and such should, these days, have dual power supplies which means you won't need a transformer to step down Europe's 220 volts to America's 110 volts. Don't, however, pack a hair dryer: running a 60 Hz motor on a 50 Hz power supply is likely to spell the end of the motor. Hotels should normally have a courtesy hair dryer you can use.

&gt; what can I do to prepare myself for traveling alone for a month in Europe?

Brace yourself for the culture shock. On the surface, Europe isn't all that different; but you'll find that things are different in ways you never thought possible.

If Juncker is picked it'll be a unprecedented outcome caused by EU parties who had to pick leading candidates for the EP elections of 2014. This happened because major parties such as EPP and S&amp;D wanted to bring EU politics more closer to the peoples of Europe and at the same time decrease the so called ""democratic deficit"" to tackle European far-right parties.

Hence, through Lisbon Treaty institutional power between EU institutions did change especially when speaking about legislation and co-procedures with the Council. BUT it was never intentional that EU parties and especially national parties would gain power to directly influence who's going to get elected as the head of the Commission.

You have to visit the region of franconia (= northern bavaria) that is called ""beer franconia"" because it has the highest density of breweries in the world (This small region of 80km X 80km is ranked third by count of breweries just behind the USA and Russia!) Most breweries are really small and some of them even sell their beer only in their own tavern/inn but every one has its own taste - although almost all produce the *standard german beer types*, but there are some really unique ones). Beer franconia is the triangle between the cities of Bayreuth, Nuremberg and Bamberg, but Bamberg is the most important one beer wise. You can visit the region on your trip to prague as it's more or less a minor detour from munich/berlin.

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.

* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.

* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)

* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.

* [Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!

* In the [Handwerkerhof](http://www.handwerkerhof.de/en/home.html) you can see how craftsmen create tradtitional products from the area in an medivial environment.

* Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 

* [Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp;amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp;amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.

* [Neues Museum Nürnberg](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neues_Museum_N%C3%BCrnberg) has a great collection of modern and contemporary art and design, for example Andy Warhol.

* [Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 

* [Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing

* In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!

* Nürnberg has a soccer team and a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

* ADIDAS and PUMA have their headquarters and big outlet shopping centres in the small town of Herzogenaurach, 25km north-west of Nuremberg. If you want to go shopping for cheap sportswear (and more), you should consider a visit. Also if you are interested in [modern](http://www.vb.com/puma/puma-hq-herzogenaurach-m.jpg) [architecture](http://www.herzogenaurach.de/typo3temp/pics/e9cc906d7d.jpg).

**Bamberg:**

* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  

* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.

* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the [""Alte Hofhaltung""](http://www.emiksch.de/Lions/2007/Bilder/slides/Bamberg_Alte_Hofhaltung.jpg) where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)

* The [Altenburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Altenburg_von_S%C3%BCden_14-09-2003_%283%29.JPG) is towering above Bamberg and you have a great view from there.

* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""

* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above

* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.

* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.

* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18) as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.spezial-keller.de/index_files/stacks_image_44.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.

* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;amp;num=30&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=de&amp;amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;radius=15000&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.

* Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

* Bamberg is a University Town with currently about 12k Students (at 70k people), so you'll find young people everywhere.

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recommend ""Schäuferla"" :)

**Bayreuth:** 

* [The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)

* [The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see

* Bayreuth has a Basketball team in the highest german league. As you see, franconia is quite strong in german basketball with 3 teams.

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live (0,5 litre of beer: beginning at 1,50€), and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car, but there are is a list of [bus lines](http://vgn.de/freizeitlinien/) (german link) that are esp. for recreational/free time destinations like wildlife parks or hiking from may 1st till november. Click ""herunterladen (PDF)"" to download a pdf with a map and images to see what to expect and maybe use google translate (google translate did not work on the homepage when I tried it, so i recommend the pdf ""workaround""). Here is a [map of the region with public transport lines](http://www.vgn.de/ib/site/documents/media/f387bb36-6624-65dd-c17b-5cde6c7b84f4.jpg/VG_Freizeit_Prospekt.jpg) that are interesting for tourists, green are regular routes, purple routes are weekend and holiday only and only in the summer while orange are weekend only during the whole year. If you need help to find the right trip, message me and I'll translate and help you to find the busses etc.

* [Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremberg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle (well, actually two castles) there and live there. 

* [Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [Morgenländischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.

* The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.

* At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or Ehrenbürg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.


**Traditional Food** you can expect in the region:
Aside from the famous [Nürnberger](http://www.nuernberger-bratwuerste.de/images/bilder/Gerichte_Feuer/46Bratwurst_20110812_437_kleiner_6%20mit%20Kraut.jpg), you should try [Fränkisches Schäuferla](http://www.frankenalb.de/uploads/pics/schaeufele_008_01.jpg) or [Saure Zipfel](http://www.antenne.de/cf/services/img/ccadd//470xx/4112797.jpg). [Spargel](http://www.spargel.net/images/spargel-mit-schinken.jpg) is also very common here. [Fränkischer Sauerbraten](http://autoimg.kochbar.de/kbrezept/45625_17700/400x266/rezept-sauerbraten-mit-lebkuchensosse-bild-nr-7.jpg) is a speciality, as there is gingerbread in the sauce. [Krenfleisch](http://www.genussregion.oberfranken.de/images_gen/spezialitaeten_bilder/716_big.jpg) has a sauce of horseradish. As side dishes, [Wirsing / Savoy cabbage](http://www.das-sonnenkorn.de/assets/images/wirsing.jpg), [Sauerkraut](http://www.marions-kochbuch.de/rezept/0283.jpg) or [Blaukraut](http://www.kostenlose-rezepte.eu/upload/Blaukraut-657.jpg) are the way to go next to the mandatory Kloß / Knödel which are either [Kartoffelklöße/knödel](http://bavariaundercover.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/kloss.jpg) (made of potatoes) or [Semmelkloß/knödel](http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/uploads/thumbnails/0009/00000000009/1024x1024/FeineSemmelknoedel_4f5e90da3a46fd18d55c0d07f683cbba_fjt2009040391.jpg)(made of bread rolls). As a dessert, you should try [Knieküchle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/K%C3%BCchla.JPG).

As drinks, try one of the [franconian white wines](http://www.bad-boys-on-tour.de/sommerhausen/bilder/bocksbeutel.jpg) in their characteristic bottles or one of the countless beers of the [region with the highest density of breweries in the world](http://www.franken-sind-keine-baiern.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Deutschland_Bier_Nebenkarte.jpg)

**Breweries I would recommend, although all are great:**

* Brauerei Wagner in Merkendorf
* Brauerei Goldener Löwe in Buttenheim (where the Levi Strauss museum is)
* Schlenkerla in Bamberg (The Rauchbier - that means Smoked beer- is a famous speciality, tastes like bacon) 
* Fässla in Bamberg
* Grasser in Huppendorf
* Klosterbrauerei in Weissenohe (founded 1050, one of the oldest breweries in germany, great food also!)

(Typical beer types in the region are ""helles"" and ""dunkles"", but also ""Märzen"" or ""Bockbier"") 

**Some Festivals in the Region:**

* [Sandkirchweih Bamberg](http://www.sandkerwa.de/startseite/) 22.-26. August

And my point is, there will be funding and assistance. We already got many of those modern rifles in private hands dude. We're one of the richest countries in the world along with a number of allies in Europe *(another rich ass fucking region)*, so funding is damn near-guaranteed. We're on a much better foot, and at a much better starting point, than all those other insurgencies you just mentioned. Especially gun and weapon training wise.  

Also, those Irish-Americans just didn't fund the IRA with Libya during The Troubles *(which I don't agree with)*, they also funded much of the arms and other shit used by the Republicans during the Irish War of Independence as well. Don't just hold up one and ignore the other. 

**EDIT:** Also, [the British weren't the only ones supporting WWII partisans dude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_during_World_War_II). lol Kinda the whole reason [this thing came about](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services#Activities). Sorry if that wasn't your implication, but just found it slightly annoying you mentioned Irish-Americans &amp; Libyans when talking about the IRA in one breath, and then only the British when talking about WWII partisans in the next breath.

They made the Mirage 2000 engine, and they had no other customer for their military jet engine branch, so making sure they got a new one with Rafale made sense strategically.

true,katarn86,ESPA,EU,"&gt; My point was that European defence co-operation has had some real benefits, and arguably there is a lot wasted within the EU's 27 armies, air forces and navies.

Sure, I agree with that, but the problem is that in many of these programs we are finding all of the problems of a multinational process (it's hard to agree and everything is slow) and we aren't finding the supposed benefits (again, the Rafale has a similar price as the EF, and France is free to decide how they want their planes), so while I agree that the interoperativity element is important, something isn't working.

Also, I don't really know which one is better, and let's hope we never find it.

Finally, I'm not sure if it's good to put all of our eggs in the same basket, as for example what would happen to our collective defence if we all used Eurofighters and we suddenly discovered that the Russians can easily counter it? Or what if the company that sells them (Eurofighter GMBH, I think) decides to jack up the prices because they know we have no option beyond paying (this is the situation that USA may eventually have with Lockheed Martin and it sounds very dangerous).

This is pretty much how parliamentary democracies which is the most common form of government in Europe work, except that federal (as an analogue to the national goverments) governments (if they exist), don't have a say in appointing the cabinet. He isn't going to run the show alone as some people seem to think. A democracy generally implies rule by majority, which means that not everyone are going to be happy. The UK can't decide alone on how EU should be run.

Cameron's party got 36% in the last UK election, and is governing as part of a coalition with the liberal democrats.
 in 2005 Labour got a majority in parliament with 35% of the vote.

I don't see how appointing someone who didn't get any % of the vote would be any more democratic, especially given that the goverments which are appointing the president/comission are not elected at the same time as the commission is appointed, in the case of UK, 4 years ago. (Not to mention Cameron has an inflated majority due to UK elections not being proportional, if the lib-dems had gotten a fair share of the seats, he might not have been pm in the first place.)

Donc pas grand chose à voir avec le statut du président...

Et c'est marrant [la suppression du Sénat](http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2014/01/09/marine-le-pen-senat-suppression-affaire-dassault_n_4566255.html), le référendum et la proportionnelle, on ne retrouve ça que dans le programme d'un seul parti... je te laisse deviner lequel ;)

&gt;Comme l'a montré le résultat du référendum sur lequel il a misé justement sur ce soutiens. Ou pas.

Jamais capté ceux qui voient en 1969 les effets de mai 1968 alors qu'il y a eu des élections en juin 1968 qui ont montré le soutien au Général.

Ce référendum ne montre strictement rien sur mai 68. Il montre au contraire la victoire des notables sénateurs, des conservateurs et des partis, c'est à dire un échec encore plus flagrant de mai 68.

&gt;C'est curieux qu'en tant que membre du FN tu mentionne l'Algérie vu ce qu'en pense Marine.

De Gaulle a sous-estimé la cruauté du FLN vis-à-vis des harkis et des pieds-noirs. C'est la seule chose que MLP lui reproche et je suis assez d'accord avec elle : il aurait dû complètement finir d'éliminer les membres du FLN et soutenir les autres indépendantistes plus raisonnables.

Et quel est le rapport avec moi ? Tu crois que dans un parti tout le monde pense de la même façon ?

&gt;De Gaulle organise une prise de pouvoir par la force militaire

Allez n'importe quoi. Reprends tes livres d'histoire. Non seulement ce n'est pas un coup d'État militaire, mais en plus il met fin à l'insurrection des généraux. Son gouvernement est totalement légitime et légal (il est investi par l'Assemblée nationale le 1er juin, par 329 voix sur 553 votants). Même Pierre Mendès-France déclare qu'il n'y a pas eu de coup d'État.

Bref, dire qu'il y a eu un coup d'État militaire en 1958 c'est n'importe quoi. 

&gt;Même réponse lors de l'indépendance de la Syrie en 45.

Les soulèvements en Syrie étaient organisés par les britanniques pour chasser les Français. Je te suggère [cet article](http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/?p=581) qui explique bien en quoi la situation ne peut être résumée par ""Même réponse lors de l'indépendance de la Syrie en 45"".

&gt;La réponse de De Gaulle aux critiques? Il s'énerve et dénonce la Chienlit. OK

C'est bien de continuer à dire n'importe quoi. Très crédible. Franchement renseigne toi sur les mesures prises, sur le nombre de logements crées, le nombre d'écoles construites et l'investissement réalisé par rapport à l'investissement disponible.

Je ne vais pas faire ton éducation.

&gt;Il y a mieux en terme de Diplomatie internationale, non?

Non je ne crois pas. C'était très bien joué

C'est quoi le problème avec ""Vive le Québec libre"" ?

&gt;Je pense notamment aux faible succès de la politique de ""rapprochement"", qui n'a pas eut d'effet réel. La france reste au départ de De Gaulle un partenaire moins important que l'Angleterre

Donc rien à voir avec ""se mettre a dos"" les Russes. Si tu as des chiffres ce serait pas mal. L'accord de 1966 devait être exécuté en 1967 et je n'ai les chiffres que jusqu'en 1965.

&gt;Reste qu'en terme de politique économique il a changé plusieurs fois de stratégie. et qu'il est difficile de l'associer a tel ou tel modèle. C'est le sens de ce que je dit.

Oui d'accord avec toi.

&gt;Oui et donc en fait dans cet article on parle de politique d'indépendance et Fillon propose d'accueillir Snowden

Nan mais je devrais faire journaliste à leur place. Il prononce un [discours le 18 juin](http://www.force-republicaine.fr/discours-francois-fillon-18-juin-2014-londres) à Londres. Il ne parle pas du tout de Thatcher dans ce discours. Il ne parle que du Général de Gaulle.

Ensuite, il était invité à la Thatcher Conference, où il a parlé de Thatcher et du libéralisme. Les deux n'ont rien à voir et il ne parlait pas du tout d'économie concernant de Gaulle.

The other possibility - is that it's a relatively long process to ship hundreds of tons of gold representing the gold reserves of an ENTIRE COUNTRY as RICH as GERMANY. 

This is not just two businessmen making a deal, it's more complicated because it's two 'nations'. 

Plus, Germany being willing to store its gold in the U.S. is a trust-building exercise. That is, it's a small piece of a certain guarantee that the U.S. and Germany will never be at war with one another again. A liberal idea. In realist terms, Germany taking its gold out of the U.S. would in some small way say '*war is not unthinkable*'. That is what would 'irritate' the U.S. And that is why it would be a *political* move/statement by Germany to take its gold back. War begins with mistrust, and if Germany doesn't even trust the U.S. with its gold this is a clear sign of a true breaking-down in German - U.S. relations. 

***This is the point***

I was only going off of what he said. He only worked in international lending (mostly syndicated/sovereign lending) so that could have something to do with it. He also worked there in the 90s and early 2000s, so things may have changed some. 

&gt; This is not true. For example, in the UK there is a right to sue for misrepresentation or negligent mistatement under the common law as well as various statutory causes of action. There are rights to sue across the EU.

I should have pointed out the UK is an exception, due to it being a common law jurisdiction. For the most part, in the civil law countries it is often the regulators suing companies for improper offerings. In the past few years some EU nations have enacted laws allowing for private rights of action, but its definitely not EU wide, and it is much more difficult to sue in a civil EU jurisdiction than the US from what I have gathered talking to people involved in both. 

I am not sure how negligent mistatement and material mistatement line up, but essentially every fact that could influence an investor's decision to buy has to be disclosed in the US. For instance, say an officer was convicted of fraud in the past, that would have to be disclosed in the US, but it does not fall into the [limited scope](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_services/financial_services_transactions_in_securities/l24033c_en.htm) of an EU prospectus. 

I recently attended a derivatives law conference. Many large US firms are advising their customers to issue in the EU for the time being (at least until 2020 if the EU makes the changes it has committed to). They cited the fact there are fewer regulations that made listing on an EU exchange cheaper and less cumbersome. Obviously with stocks there are incentives to list in the US or dual list, but if you ""follow the money"" so to speak, many firms are advising to list in Europe, at least for the time being. 

Some of these things could change in the future, especially should a strong EU single regulator come to fruition, but as of now there is still many regulatory benefits to list in the EU over the US.

&gt; A Swedish prosecutor who issued a later-revoked arrest warrant against WikiLeaks founder and editor Julian Assange believed Assange was about to leave the country, according to a statement posted on the Sweden Prosecution Authority's website.
  
  
&gt;The warrant, issued on charges of rape and molestation, was revoked by Chief Prosecutor Eva Finne less than a day later.
  
  
  
  the second which the case got transfered to dropped the charges was the Chief Prosecutor of Stockholm, Eva Finne, and the third who reopened the case eleven days later due to was the Director of Public Prosecution Marianne Ny.

...  
  
  
&gt; After the defeat of the Social Democrats in 2006, he resigned to start a law firm with former Social Democratic Minister of Justice Thomas Bodström as partner.
  
  
who became the women's legal representative  
  
&gt; In 2010 Borgström successfully appealed the decision to close the sexual assault case against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and became the legal representative of the two Swedish women who have accused Assange of sexual misconduct.  
  
  
Note that his partner [Thomas Bodström](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bodstr%C3%B6m) was Minister of Justice from 2000-2006 and at the time was the Chairman of the Reiksdag on judicial issues.  
  
&gt; Thomas Lennart Bodström (born 9 April 1962) is a Swedish politician and member of the Swedish Social Democratic Party. He was the Swedish Minister for Justice in the two last succeeding governments of the Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson, from 2000 to 2006. From October 2006 until October 2010 he was the chairman of the Riksdag committee for judicial issues.  
  
  
Although Borgström was not fond of Bodström  
  
&gt; Borgström himself had plans of becoming the Minister of Justice if the Social Democrats had won the election in 2010 according to his client Sture Bergwall. Claes said the following of the current Minister of Justice and his current partner: ""I have no high thoughts of Thomas Bodström. It is actually unimaginable how the current Minister of Justice was chosen for his post. He is a shallow person.""  
  
  
... to call him politically inactive is pretty much disinformation. He at no point left the party  
  
&gt; ...and Left Party politician. Up until 2013, he was a member of the Social Democratic Party.  
  
... so being a politican is being politically inactive, while having the former Minister of Justice and current Chairman of the Reiksdag as you partner, while planning to make a run for Minister of Justice yourself in case your party wins (which it didn't).

Pole conducted by Forsa Institute.

&gt;Accusations of political bias[edit]
Both forsa and its head, Manfred Güllner, have been accused of bias towards the SPD in connection with pre-election polls, most recently before the 2005 election in North Rhine-Westphalia. Forsa was successful in obtaining an injunction against accusations from the CDU on this issue, but their surveys did show in part a greater agreement with SPD positions than those of other polling firms. Forsa have themselves stated that they received 40,000 € in fees in connection with the national election in 2002 and in connection with the state election in 2005. In an interview on 6 September 2002, Hans Mathias Kepplinger, a professor of public relations at the University of Mainz, named three other firms as relatively likely to be free of party bias, but not forsa,[4] although one of the three he named, the Institut für Demoskopie Allensbach, which has collaborated with the University of Mainz, cannot be said to be altogether free of ties to the CDU.[citation needed]

&gt;After the national elections in 2005, forsa's closeness to the SPD lessened appreciably and indeed reversed: in 2007 and still more in the first quarter of 2008, forsa reported poll results for the SPD an average of approximately 5% lower than those of other polling firms. Accusations have therefore been levelled at forsa of slanting results against the SPD and its ""reformist course"" after former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, a longtime friend of Manfred Güllner, stood down in favour of the CDU's Angela Merkel.[5]

&gt;""One example was a study in summer 2008 on the basis of which forsa reported that 36% of SPD members had considered leaving the party. Then-party chief Kurt Beck criticised Güllner severely and stated that he would not comment on forsa surveys.[6]

&gt;Accusations of data manipulation[edit]
In 2003 forsa was accused of data manipulation in a poll on tuition fees for higher education commissioned by the Centre for College Development (Centrum für Hochschulentwicklung) co-founded by the Bertelsmann Foundation. According to the statement of findings, the majority of students (59%) and of the population (67%) stated in November 2003 that they would accept tuition fees if they directly benefitted the educational institutions and could be financed through loans.[7] The Centre for College Development announced these results in a press release in December 2003 and they were reported in the press.[8][9] But later that month, a spokesperson for the Centre indirectly admitted that respondents were only given the option of deciding between three models of tuition fees, and not of rejecting them entirely.[10]

&gt;In 2007 forsa was accused on the political website NachDenkSeiten of becoming involved through manipulation of a survey in a campaign by the organization Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft (Initiative for a New Social Market Economy) for the introduction of private health insurance.[11]

&gt;Forsa was the market research firm involved in the 2009 public relations scandal concerning Deutsche Bahn. Surveys with leading questions which produced results showing disapproval of the 2007 train drivers' strike and approval of privatisation of the railway were secretly funded by Deutsche Bahn.[12][13]

I certainly dont think its all London's fault. I was only trying to point out London, for obvious reasons, is pushing back significantly on both new EU proposals and the scope of the powers of the single regulator. London has been regulating its financial industry for hundreds of years, so I dont blame them for not wanting the EU to take over the vast majority of that task. By most metrics, London is the financial capital of the world, not New York, and the UK has a very strong interest in keeping it that way. 

&gt;A strong single EU regulator isn't necessarily what London needs. Good regulation is required, rather than simply strong regulation :-)

I agree. I do think some of the EU proposals were ""good"". I think the UK opposed them more on principal that they would be administered extraterritorially than the actual changes themselves. Its my opinion, but I also think the UK would like to put off changing its regulations for as long as possible to attract business from the US. That is my opinion as to why they are dragging their feet (in 2009 the G20 agreed to make specific financial reforms by 2012. The new EU target is 2020). Obviously I am not in the back room discussions within the UK government, but it seems reasonable to me. I dont blame them, everyone is looking for potential growth areas, and given the financial infrastructure in London it would be very easy to absorb any new business.

They can go around in tracksuit and flip-flops all day long as long as they remain in their home but as soon as they pass the door they generally are presentable and clean. I know a lot of Americans don't see the need to dress properly to go to the supermarket at the next corner but french people have an habit of doing so, as dumb as it may seem from a foreign perspective.

Also no need to tip for a normal service in a restaurant or a bar. If your waiter has been exceptionnally helpful or really went out of her way to meet your expectations (eg : she made sure you got served fast when you were in a hurry for example) feel free to leave her a little something, but just keep in mind it is not expected and please please please don't tip if the waiter has not been pleasant, it is really ridiculous in France. It is a bit as if you said ""You sure treated me like shit, here is a little reward for that"". Waiters' salary is included in the bill you pay, no need to add anything to it and doing so is not expected.

Except for that the rest is pretty much common sense really, try learning a couple of sentences in French, it is generally what will make the difference between ""tourist #482490241 from WhoCaresVille, Somestate, Somecountry"" and ""nice tourist which at least tries a bit and that I will gladly help with his trip"".
