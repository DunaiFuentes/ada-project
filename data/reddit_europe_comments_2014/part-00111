true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; Here's some realpolitik. Russia can, will, and does violate ""international laws"". As have Europeans and Americans. Strong countries do what they want to weaker ones. If you're trying to implement some sort of standard, the first step would be to follow it. Right now you're taking the moral high ground and there is absolutely no basis on which to do so.

&gt; Secondly, we have no right to impose any rules on Russia. This is a matter of diplomacy. Russia is not a subordinate state that has stepped out of line that only needs to be slapped back into place. There is a necessity to talk them down, not threaten them with military force.

I'm not taking moral high ground. I'm talking realpolitik. We have set a bunch of rules that we expect the world to follow: stuff like ""don't annex parts of other countries."" When Russia does that, and we do nothing, it ruins our credibility on *everything*.

You misunderstand the situation. Russia is not our equal. We are a superpower, and they have fallen to the status of a regional power. Either they can be a partner to America, like Chile or Morocco or Japan, or, if they are unwilling to follow the rules we set, we will seek to contain them and limit their influence and power, like Venezuela or Iran. Russia, in real terms, *should* be a subordinate state. As sovereign states, we may legally have to treat them as equals, but in real terms, we lead a coalition that includes the overwhelming majority of the world's richest and militarily strongest countries. Russia is a decayed husk of our biggest rival, with a military that had difficult with a neighbor 3% its size. If, as you imply, the strong do as they will and the weak suffer as they must, then we ought to be strong-arming the shit out of Russia and exploiting its weaknesses until it realizes that cooperating with us will be greater benefits than trying to screw us. Russia absolutely has stepped out of line and it *should* be slapped back into place. Otherwise other countries will start mimicking Russia. 

It's not just about Russia: it's about deterrence everywhere. If we can prove that we can deter Russia, then other powers seeking to upset the balances of power that we have created (Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, etc.) will not dare to step out of line from the rules we have set. If we capitulate to Russia, then those countries will be bolder, and that will require more US energy (and possibly blood and treasure) to contain. Deterring the big rivals saves us energy in the long run by convincing smaller rivals that it's not worth it to oppose us.

&gt; It will have proven that Russia, one of the most powerful countries on the planet, can exert regional influence. Big deal. You think that's going to set a precedent? Because it wont. The only other country outside of Western influence that can do that is China, everyone else gets bombed back to the stone age - if it suits our interests.

And why isn't Russia being bombed back to the Stone Age? If we do not act against Russia because of their military, then all we have done is convince everyone who hates us to build a huge military. It doesn't have to be enough to beat us--since we could beat even Russia--just enough to make a war deeply unpleasant for us. If Iran weren't building a nuclear bomb before, it sure as shit will do it now, now that we've proven that possessing nukes makes us less willing to take action to prevent you from taking what you want with force.",0,1397915508,null,0,false,0,cgwiagw,t3_23d5tr,t1_cgwiagw,t1_cgwhuaj,null,1433425491,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,FleshyDagger,ESTO,Estonia,"&gt; Actually the US made concessions to get the USSR to give up Cuba. They took all their missiles out of Turkey.

Not really. The Jupiter missiles in Turkey had become obsolete and were scheduled to be replaced in six months' time in favor of submarine-based Polaris missiles. Effectively, the US gave up nothing. In addition, the Soviet Union had to agree to keep the removal of Jupiters in secret, at the risk of the agreement become void. The need for such maneuvering became evident through Khrushchev's letters to Kennedy, which revealed a conflict within the leadership of the Soviet Union, and it was meant to give Khrushchev upper hand in dealing with his internal rivals. Let's not forget that Khrushchev was at odds with military leaders, and *was* ultimately deposed.

If you suggest we should manufacture some ""concessions"" that Putin could parade around for internal support in his administration, then I'm all for it. An actual ""concession"" - no, thanks. This would simply mean that anyone who manages to build an army large enough can start blackmailing others, a world order guaranteed not to bring peace and prosperity, but rather an arms race and a proliferation of nuclear weapons.

&gt; They didn't strongarm and intimidate Khrushchev into giving up.

This is not true. The US acted decisively when the Soviet Union attempted to break the naval blockade, based on the Rio Treaty and set up on the authorization of the Organization of American States. Warning shots were fired over bows of approaching ships, and vessels enforcing the blockade were authorized to make minimum damage required to halt anyone crossing the established blockade line.

This was a clear signal that the Soviet Union could not continue by using raw force, and helped to bring a diplomatic solution. ",0,1397917719,null,0,1397918186,0,cgwixmr,t3_23d5tr,t1_cgwixmr,t1_cgwil8d,null,1433425860,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Even when you're got people who are actually interested in a discussion, and not just racist asshats, it's a really touchy subject that tends to get people up in arms, so having a debate about it that doesn't devolve into name calling is really difficult. In addition, it's a topic which  brings in multiple different issues, which muddies the waters even more. Is an ""Anti-Islam"" debate about people who are Islamic, or is it about Arabs? Or are European Muslims fine, and it's just Muslim immigrants that people are upset about? And if that's the case, maybe it's not Islam at all, and we should really be having a discussion about immigration instead. No one ever bothers clarifying *exactly* what they mean, so even people with the same opinion about the problem might end up arguing against each other.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; But I was not talking legit. Being a parliament member you have some ""powers"". You can easily ""influence"" the lower level governments (for example city local gov.), act your power upon bureaucrats.

Over here the officials and bureaucrats are pretty independend from the influence of MPs, same with city/communal councils, and being a mere MP does not suddenly bring you much power over those. That is not to say MPs are without any influence, but it is actually quite limited.

Now, being a minister with a ministry to lead - then we're talking about having influence and actual power within that ministry.

&gt; And with these kinds of things there is always someone who would like that things would go his way more. Now you have a demand, and someone with the supply, offer enough money and here you go.

Yep, there always is someone or some organisation that would like to see something to happen in their favour, and most often in a democracy there's multiple interests and multiple people promoting those. Promoting transparency in decision making is a good idea as it makes potential wrongdoings easier to see.

&gt; Also land allocation (want to legitimize your house on the beach, lakeside or national park? no problem! As long as you have the money) is another way of making money.

Yep, and there has been many questionable cases of such over here. But land allocation is not in MPs powers - it is handled by city/communal councils.

&gt; Of course this might not be a thing in Finland (I am not familiar with the situation there) but it sure is here.

Finland does well in international comparisons and corruption indexes but is not totally corruption free. It happens, and most often in communal council level.

Nevertheless, I do not agree with the premise that MPs are not decent people and are in it for money.

To begin with, there's not much actual debate.

""Anti-Islam"" is such a vague topic, so a lot of people will start arguing about what even constitutes ""Islam"" (actual religion, tenets of religion, followers of religion, cultures with religion, or just people with brown skin?)

Some will argue against the debate - because an attempt to clear up the confusion laid out above is an attempt to label people, well, obviously, that's stereotyping, and that's bad.

Then there are a few stormfront-types who show up and ask pointed questions of *everyone*, trying to ignite a reaction - generally trolling, and derailing the debate.

Some antifascist radicals (left wingers, anarchists?) will show up as well, spewing *their* hate talk, effectively trolling, whatever their intention is.

The result, when you look at such a debate, is a mess of idiocy - and no-one with any sense gets involved. Any attempt to get me to involve myself in such a debate would be dismissed or ignored.

&gt;__Neapolitan__ (autonym: *nnapulitano*; [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language): *napoletano*) is the language of southern continental Italy, including the city of [Naples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples). It is named not after the city, but after the [Kingdom of Naples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Naples), which once covered most of this area and of which Naples was the capital. On October 14, 2008 a law by the Region of [Campania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campania) stated that the Neapolitan language was to be protected.  It has been recognized by [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO) as a language and a heritage. Neapolitan has had a significant influence on the intonation of [Rioplatense Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rioplatense_Spanish), of the [Buenos Aires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires) region of [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina).

J'ai jamais dit ca. Je constate par contre qu'un certain nombre de personnes ont été régulièrement tabassées par des bikers ou des cossacks par pur hasard fortuits en rentrant ou partant le matin ou le soir, qui savaient ou ils habitaient et le chemin qu'ils allaient prendre.

&gt;  D'ailleurs Hitler avait signé un accord de transfert avec Israël, il voyait d'un très bon œil l'installation de cet état juif et l'a favorisé.

&gt; Unfortunately, the US got too greedy this time and Putin is now forced to show muscles, like in Georgia when after the colored revolution there, the new government was integrating with NATO and discussing putting a ballistic missile shield there. It was also followed by a Russian intervention.

Actuellement les US ont oublié de faire des efforts de soutient au premier nuage et c'est même un des trucs qui me font hurler. 

Bref, c'est pas exactement l'invasion NATO que tu t'imagine et c'est même l'inverse (on devrait imho intervenir et repousser les russes hors d'ukraine de l'est jusqu'à la frontière; mais ils trainent les pieds car trop proche de la russie à leur gout).

&gt; Unfortunately, the US got too greedy this time and Putin is now forced to show muscles, like in Georgia when after the colored revolution there, the new government was integrating with NATO 

Uh what. Autant la georgie à un peu cherché, autant la Georgie ne sera jamais dans NATO ever à moins qu'on veuille le faire juste pour adresser un gros FUCK YOU aux russes en retour si l'ukraine de l'est tombe sous leur coupe. 

Quand à un bouclier anti missile la bas tu hallucine imho. Y en à un en europe à demi fonctionnel pour couvrir notre propre continent mais c'est tout. Le vrai ABM fonctionnel est en, et couvre principalement l'amérique du nord et y en a manifestement un second fonctionnel en russie. Faudrait arrêter de déformer.

&gt; Good old Cold War will not be over until all ex-USSR countries are in the EU

Pour l'Europe de l'est dans l'EU ca doit avoir un rapport avec le fait que l'URSS les à joyeusement enculé pendant 50 ans. Y a qu'a voir la pologne avoir des crises d'histerie chaque fois qu'ils imaginent voir les soviets les approcher. 

Donc ouais globalement tout ce qui est à l'est de la Russie veux s'en sauver en courant et nous rejoindre parce que c'est pas nous qui avions une STASI et un KGB dans la moitié du continent qui disparaissait tout ceux qui levaient la voix, désolé. Maintenant tu va dire que la CIA est pas vraiment mieux, mais je soulèverait qu'ils opèrent pas tant que ca sur notre propre continent; ou du moins pas aussi ouvertement.

""During the past decade, Ukraine has gained a reputation as one of the world's most active suppliers of illegal small arms. It is one of several Eastern European countries that has turned to arms dealing as a source of much-needed hard currency. Between 1997 and 2000, the Ukrainian arms industry grew tenfold and exported $1.5 billion worth of weapons. While Ukraine's legal arms industry has boomed, the international small arms black market may have proved far more lucrative. Ukrainian arms have been linked to some of the world's bloodiest conflicts and most notorious governments, including the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein, and, until recently, the Taliban in Afghanistan.""

No! Missions are politically difficult enough as it is, wars are downright impossible. Hence missions. Or rather, ""missions"". Big difference, even if it's mostly semantics.

&gt; And why tanks? How many drones can you buy for one tank?

That was just the most obvious example. Having more tanks in Germany would be pointless, since, if at all, they would be needed at the EU's Eastern border. So it would be better to have more trained and equipped tank groups right there, instead of having them in Germany and risking further escalation (and delays) when an emerging situation would call for an increase of defensive ground capacity in, say, Poland.

The language ability of some has been questioned in recent years. The research potentially shows more wide-ranging inadequacies. Around 1,300 foreign physicians are licensed each year by the General Medical Council after passing an exam which assesses clinical and language skills.But the study, commissioned by the GMC and carried out by University College London, found that around half would fail to reach the standards expected of British doctors. Its authors have called for the pass rate of the competency exam to be raised from 63 to 76 per cent to “ensure patient safety”.

&gt; Pour info, 14 / 88 est un signe de ralliement néonazi inscrit sur les casques de nombreux manifestants. 14 pour la race blanche et 88 pour heil Hitler. Les logos utilisés sont ceux des SS.

Sure, ce sont des symboles nazis. Mais lesquels ont dépassés qques symboles et though-guy-act sont passés aux actes fascistes et le tabassage de dissidents entre eux et les russes ?

&gt; Ah oui, donc le fait que l'Ukraine rejette le traité de libre-échange avec l’UE est une pure coïncidence avec le début des manifestations.

Oui et non. Tu prends la chaine en route ; même si à mon avis tu n'as pas tapé bien loin :

- Yanoukovich pillait tranquillement l'ukraine, manque de bol la caisse est vide

- Il voit ca, et fait du pieds aux russes et à l'UE en même temps pour avoir la meilleur offre

- Les civils crevent de faim, sa popularité s'effondre

- Il fait mine de se rapprocher de l'EU car le niveau de vie est parfois plus élevé chez nous qu'en russie pour rattraper de la popularité

- Puis quand il voit qu'on offre moins que les russes, il commence par rejetter l'offre de l'UE

- les gens grognent, les premiers gens s'approchent de place maidan. Il y à à ce moment là quelques centaines de personnes coordonées par FB

-  il se rapproche alors de de la russie qui offre 15 milliards. Jusque là ca à du sens, les gens grognent plus à kiev mais le gros du pays ne se fatigue pas

- Et la les gens découvrent qu'il va détourner une bonne partie de l'argent et en gros à planifié d'en utiliser une partie pour ralentir la chute du pays, planquer un gros morceau à l'étranger et fuir avant la banqueroute du pays.

- C'est fin décembre des milliers se rassemblent sur la place; ca commence sérieusement à péter

- L'EU s'en mèle alors, parce que quelques gens qui meurent à notre porte sous le drapeau européen sans qu'on bouge, ca fait quand même mauvais genre.

- Arrive le point trouble de l'histoire, les snipers à Maidan. Les faits connus à coup sûr est que des snipers ont tiré répétitivement sur la foule majoritairement désarmée; jusqu'à que right sektor ramène des armes, et réplique. Les snipers ont alors fuit. 2j après la foule enragée décide que c'est la faute de Y' ; et envahi le palais présidentiel. 

Il fuit alors, tentant de détruire de nombreux documents dans ses différents palais en les jettant dans la piscine, le lac privé ou la cheminée selon les lieux (manifestement en courant; sans prendre le temps de faire ca proprement).

De nombreux indices me laissent penser que ce serait le GRU ou FSB qui sont en cause. La question est toutefois débattable pour être franc. D'autres théories impliquent que certains extremistes aient ramené des armes sur Maidan, et quand les snipers ont commencé à tiré les extremistes ont tiré sur les flics (berkut); qui ont paniqué à leur tour et répliqué en tirant sur la foule. 

J'imagine toutefois que certains pourraient y voir l'action de la CIA, même si ho nettement sur ce coup je suis pas convaincu.

- Le reste est de l'histoire (yanoukovich renversé, etc).

&gt; Non, ils se contentent de nous diviser, de nous espionner, de nous racheter avec leurs faux dollars et tout le temps de mentir, comme en Iraq.

Je trouve que si les américains ont parfois fait de la merde, ils sont quand même le coupable idéal pratique pour blamer de tout et n'importe quoi. L'espionnage, honnêtement on est pas tout à fait les derniers non plus hein :P

Pour les dollars, c'est effectivement un gros souci (corporatisme) mais qui est quasi indépendant du gouvernement. En fait j'irait même jusqu'à dire que les corporations tentent de prendre le pouvoir aux USA et que le gouvernement en est à ses derniers soubresauts. Les fameuses guerres du petrole en sont le symbole; mais y a pas de petrole en Ukraine. Il y a du gaz, mais si qqun l'obtient ce seront pas eux de toute facon.

&gt; dont on sait qu'ils étaient commandités par les révolutionnaires.

Je serais ravis de lire tes preuves à ce sujet, parce que pour moi c'est encore sacrément boueux comme question. Je me garderait bien de pointer des doigts avant qu'on retrouve les armes utilisés pour les tirs (on à quelques douilles donc on peut le prouver si on les trouve); et qui les à utiliser (si tant est que les snipers ont pas utilisé de gants ou de agents ""clean"", ""jetables"", dormant et sur aucun fichiers que beaucoup de services secrets se réservent pour ce genre d'occasions puis en changent pour éviter de se faire chopper).

&gt; The US are organizing ""colored revolutions"" in ex-USSR countries since 2000 is well documented. The 2004 election of a pro-West government was the result of the Orange revolution in Ukraine.

Pour revenir sur ce point, y a une raison très simple : Le niveau de vie n'as pas bougé d'un millimètre avant. Le roi est mort, vive le roi. Donc les gens en ont toujours marre, et rechangent de gouvernement par la force. Un peu comme peu après la révolution francaise ca à été le bordel pendant un siècle ou deux avec des changement de gouvernement tout les ans; jusqu'à qu'en on ait eu un qui à décidé que c'était peut-être temps d'adresser les vrai questions et REGLER LE PUTAIN DE PROBLEME SOCIAL . 

De nos jours actuellement en europe de l'est ce serait sans doute renvoyer de la richesse et des allocations en masse à la population qui en à grave marre de manger du pain 2x par jour et rationner l'usage de la lumière parce que sinon ils sont en découvert dès que la facture électrique sort; ou encore devoir rembourser des emprunts d'étude pendant 20/30 ans qui les saigne continuellement. 

Parce que les gens qui se tapent des salaires non versés 6 mois de suite et 200E/mois le reste du temps ont étrangement tendance à finir par pêter un câble et se dire que ce gouvernement là qui détourne des dizaines de milliards pour se construire des villas et se payer des flottes avions de luxe pendant la même periode, ils en ont en fait pas besoin. du tout.

All because the Spanish and the French governments can't say no to their fishermen.

That's a good point. I can't justify our actions by pointing out Russia's and then simultaneously criticising those Russian actions. 

&gt;Maintaining influence. This conflict is practically existential for Russia. If they lose here, they lose influence regionally, which means they're done. Which also means they're not simply going to let go.

I think they could have maintained  influence without this. If anything it had put the world in an awkward position. The EU definitely wants Russia as an economic partner.

If he has doubts about his fatherhood he can demand a paternity test. To get a paternity test he has to apply for one at court. This is necessary because in Germany it's forbidden to test any persons genetic material without consent. Since a baby can't consent a court order is necessary. This process is not that expensive (maybe 200 Euros, I don't know) and more or less a formality since it gets almost always granted.

I don't know what happens if you reconise a child and it turns out it's not yours. Maybe somebody else can clarify this point.

If you have a child with somebody, get divorced and you don't get custody of the child, you have to pay child support till the child is 21 or can support itself. If the child is below a certain age (don't know what age) you have to pay additional aliments to the person who has custody if he/she doesn't work and choses to stay at home with the child.

The amount of money you have to pay is determined individually by court depending on the age of the child, your income, if the child is still in school and the previous standard of living of the family before the divorce took place. But you will always get to keep a minimum amount of your monthly earnings for yourself which is supposed to cover your own necessary expanses (I don't know if the current amount is fair). If you can't pay child support the state will cover the expenses and get the money back from you as soon as your economic situation gets better.

And if you get old and sick and need a lot of care by state institutions, your child has to pay a contribution for your place in the nursing home, also depending on his/her income :)

I don't know what happens if you get ""tricked"" into fathering a child. But usually this can be avoided by not dating crazy girls. Most of the times they are easy to recognise. Because they are crazy...

I think they'd be strongly supportive. Historically speaking, the two biggest opponents to it would be France and Poland. I expect they'd both support it. Germany isn't going to turn on NATO all of a sudden, and neither are France and Poland.

Moving onto the 'smaller' nations, I'd expect the Baltics for example, would feel increasingly secure knowing Europe's military power and projection is growing significantly as a result of Germany upping the ante.

&gt; We just don't want it.

Clearly you don't. I get there's a natural aversion to all things military in Germany, and to an extent that's the ideal way to be. But Europe, despite its claims to be a global powerhouse, is routinely embarrassed militarily.

&gt; And we don't feel like we need it.....yet.

Fair enough. But if and when Germany does decide it needs it, then there's an issue. Take current ongoings. Forget the allies, what sort of response would German militarisation elicit from Russia?

Spostato quindi nel salone seguente quello dove vi è la macchina del caffè ho visto Pinelli seduto vicino ad Eliane Vincileone.

In seguito, da informazioni datemi da Sergio Ardau e dallo stesso Pinelli ho saputo che Pinelli era stato fermato venerdì sera e interrogato lungamente nella stessa serata di venerdì. Nella notte di venerdì non aveva dormito. Pinelli mi è parso seccato e stanco, ma in condizioni normali. Mi ha parlato del suo alibi e mi è apparso sicuro. Più tardi gli è stata fatta una sfuriata da parte di un agente, che saprei riconoscere, perché aveva gettato della cenere per terra (numerosi i testimoni) e lui si è chinato a raccoglierla. Più tardi, a sera inoltrata, per ordine di Calabresi siamo stati divisi nella stanza in tavoli diversi, mentre Pinelli e Moi sono stati fatti mettere nella stanza del caffè.

Verso le 24 sono stati fatti andare via tutti gli altri e siamo rimasti io, l’Eliane e Lorenzo. In seguito io e Lorenzo siamo stati portati in cella di sicurezza: non ho più visto Pinelli fino alla domenica dopo pranzo, mi ha detto che lo avevano interrogato la notte di sabato e fatto riposare qualche ora in camera di sicurezza nella giornata di domenica. Nel frattempo io ero stato interrogato e mi avevano portato nel mio abbaino per una perquisizione. Domenica pomeriggio ho parlato con Pino e con Eliane e Pino mi ha detto che facevano difficoltà per il suo alibi, del quale si mostrava sicurissimo. Mi ha anche detto di sentirsi perseguitato da Calabresi e che aveva paura di perdere il posto alle ferrovie. Verso sera un funzionario si è arrabbiato perché parlavo con gli altri e mi ha fatto mettere nella segreteria che è adiacente all’ufficio del Pagnozzi: ho avuto occasione di cogliere alcuni brani degli ordini che Pagnozzi lasciava ai suoi inferiori per la notte. Dai brani colti posso affermare che ha detto di riservare al Pinelli un trattamento speciale, di non farlo dormire e di tenerlo sotto pressione tutta la notte. Di notte il Pinelli è stato portato in un’altra stanza e la mattina mi ha detto di essere molto stanco, che non lo avevavo fatto dormire e che continuavano a ripetergli che il suo alibi era falso. Mi è parso molto amareggiato. Siamo rimasti tutti il giorno nella stessa stanza, quella del caffè e abbiamo potuto scambiare solo alcune frasi, comunque molto signicative. Io gli ho detto: “Pino, perché ce l’hanno con noi?” e lui molto amareggiato mi ha detto: “Si, ce l’hanno con me”. Sempre nella serata di lunedì gli ho chiesto se avesse firmato dei verbali e lui mi ha detto di no. Verso le otto è stato portato via e quando ho chiesto ad una guarda dove fosse mi ha risposto che era andato a casa. Io pensavo che stesse per toccare a me di subire l’interrogatorio, certamente il più pesante di quelli avvenuti fino ad allora: avevo quasta precisa impressione.

Dopo un po’, penso verso le 11.30, ho sentito dei rumori sospetti come di una rissa e ho pensato che Pinelli fosse ancora li e che lo stessero picchiando. Dopo un po’ di tempo c’è stato il cambio di guardia, cioè la sostituzione del piantone di turno fino a mezzanotte. Poco dopo ho sentito come delle sedie smosse ed ho visto gente che correva nel corridoio verso l’uscita, gridando “si è gettato”. Alle mie domande hanno risposto che si era gettato il Pinelli; mi hanno anche detto che hanno cercato di trattenerlo ma non vi sono riusciti. Calabresi mi ha detto che stavano parlando scherzosamente del Pietro Valpreda, facendomi chiaramente capire che era nella stanza nel momento in cui Pinelli cascò. Inoltre mi hanno detto che Pinelli era un delinquente, aveva le mani in pasta dappertutto e sapeva molte cose degli attentati del 25 aprile. Queste cose mi sono state dette da Panessa e Calabresi mentre altri poliziotti mi tenevano fermo su una sedia pochi minuti dopo il fatto di Pinelli. Specifico inoltre che dalla posizione in cui mi trovavo potevo vedere con chiarezza il pezzo di corridoio che Calabresi avrebbe dovuto necessariamente percorrere per recarsi nello studio del dottor Allegra e che nei minuti precedenti il fatto Calabresi non è assolutamente passato per quel pezzo di corridoio.",0,1397933988,null,0,false,0,cgwpcdx,t3_23cd3k,t1_cgwpcdx,t3_23cd3k,null,1433428881,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

Concerning your second point:

A military is always corrupt and there is always a lack of transparency, private or not. At least it can't subvert our democracies if it's just a service provider and not part of our societies.

US troops in germany aren't an occupying force.  Germany can have whatever foreign policy they want but American protection allows Germany and pretty much the rest of Europe to not need a foreign policy, which is why America has to take the lead in places like Bosnia and Ukraine.  

Why would German feelings toward Israel surprise you?  Germany was essentially the most cosmopolitan and civilized country on earth in the '20s and '30s; so what?  We saw where that led.  Less than 20 years after the holocaust, the German left was actively fighting israel.  Like, with guns on the ground in the Middle East.  Less than 30 years after the holocaust, the German left was hijacking planes and physically separating Jewish hostages from non-Jews.  The left did this with a great deal of general support from the people of Germany.  Just because kids learn about the nazis in school and take class trips to concentration camps doesn't mean the people have changed. Do you think the kind of murderous hate that fueled the holocaust just disappears in two generations?  The rise of Jobbik shows that it doesn't.  Does our fellow redditor actually want to murder all Jews?  Beats me, but I sure know to be suspicious of someone who can't come up with 5 things about his own country that he doesn't like without making one of them about the Jews.

What military in the EU is corrupt? A military serves its people, and most European military forces are heavily bound by laws and regulations.

A military, on the other hand, isn't a profit organization, it is under the command of the government, which in turn is under the command of the people (if it wants to be re-elected).

The only real problem I can see is language really. If EU were to have a military, it'd need to speak English, because that's what is readily available in all the populations.

So if Germany wanted to grow Europe's muscle in a very peaceful way that all the countries in Europe could embrace (and which would be a  HUGE economic boon to particularly Southern and Eastern Europe)....

**Step 1**: Bring English in as a language German military operates in alongside German (this not unprecedented in any way, Finnish military has units operating primarily in Swedish).

**Step 2**: Start some ""rapid reaction"" forces for Europe. They will be funded by individual nations to begin with and wave their flags (in this case Germany), but there's a clear idea that they are for the EU at large. 

**Step 3**: Open recruitment to those units or at least some of them from anywhere inside the EU. It'd still be a German unit, but it might be 50% or more foreign, and it'd speak English.  

**Step 4**: Locate the units and their bases at the ""frontiers"" of Europe, or near them, rather than in Germany. By this I mean Poland, Romania, Finland but perhaps also Spain


This would bring Europe together a great deal more. It would certainly make out defense feel a great deal more robust **and** it would stimulate the economies around those bases quite nicely (like the US has done with its bases). 

If the English speaking units were working out, I wouldn't be shocked if some countries would elect to merge their militaries with the German military (with some neat ""EU military"" flag flowing).

Why? Because their military is not in a position to win any battles they're likely to have to fight. Estonia? Unless Latvia attacks, they're fucked anyway. If the units there are EU troops? Different thing.

This would be the easiest way to a European military.

So are militaries. 


&gt;A PMC has a direct interest in subverting democracy and forcing wars to happen, that's basic business


One could argue that a military also needs wars to justify its existents. 


&gt; The US is already having massive problems with its military industry lobbying the hell out of the government and thinking only about profit, not what's best for the country or the servicemen. 



And that is exactly my fear. A strong military has a strong influence on politics. (And politicians start to think they can play Alexander the Great! That actually maybe the biggest problem.)


&gt;What you're proposing goes much further than even that. You want the defence of a democratic people to be put in the hands of undemocratic organizations whose primary objectives would be profit and potential gain.



Even if  the military is controlled by elected civilians it is still an undemocratic organizations whose primary goals are to grow and justify it's existence (via war).



If you have a huge military hammer every problem will look like a nail. Or something like that.

Credo che da un certo livello di capacità e autonomia in poi, forzare una metodologia (anche se scrum può essere anche light) dall'alto sia una  perdita di tempo. Tutto può essere utile ma nulla è indispensabile. 

E sono convinto che i buoni programmatori non abbiano bisogno di essere ""diretti"". Il compito del manager è quello di rimuovere gli ostacoli esterni che impediscono al suo sottoposto di fare il suo lavoro.

true,bobdole3,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;So are militaries. 

True, anyone in a position of power is susceptible to corruption. Who watches the watchmen and all that. But at the end of the day, I'd rather put my faith in an organization which exists to protect my country, than one which exists to get paid.

&gt;One could argue that a military also needs wars to justify its existence.

You could, but you'd be wrong. A PMC only gets paid when there's a war going on, or when a country is gearing up for war. A national military exists and gets paid regardless of what's actually going on in the world. As long as the *concept* of war exists, a military is needed, while a PMC is only needed when a *real* war exists. A military does not need to justify its existence, while a PMC does. 

&gt;And that is exactly my fear. A strong military has a strong influence on politics. (And politicians start to think they can play Alexander the Great! That actually maybe the biggest problem.)

You're not only exaggerating, you're actually mixing your examples, and it actually hurts your argument. We have to draw a line between the actual military, and the various military industries (like GE, Boeing, that sort of thing). The problem in the US is that the *industries* are constantly lobbying for more military spending, which is actually supported by a large swath of the population. Arms manufacturing is one of the most lucrative investments in the US, and much of the actual production is done domestically. Companies don't want to take a hit to their profits, and people throughout the country rely on these companies for work. 

The actual military meanwhile is *against* some of the more ridiculous spending measures. For example, the Pentagon has explicitly told Congress that it does not need any more tanks, but Congress is still pushing about a thousand more down their throats, because cutting the program would be political suicide. So using the American context, the *military* is calling for restraint while *private interests* are warping the system. 

&gt;Even if the military is controlled by elected civilians it is still an undemocratic organizations whose primary goals are to grow and justify it's existence (via war).

The military is mostly undemocratic, so the solution is to throw it away in  favor of a system which is *completely* undemocratic? Wat?",0,1397942946,null,0,false,0,cgwt2jp,t3_23fkjj,t1_cgwt2jp,t1_cgwrpes,null,1433430703,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

You know what? I've got nothing to do with what happened 3 Generations ago. All I can do is caring for what today's generations do with the world. And Israel does a lot of mistakes.

The highest ranking US defense official said that if European NATO members dont at least attempt to meet their targets, or at a minimum stop making cuts, the US could withdraw from NATO. Germany is the largest economy in the EU, so by default, if it was meeting its target it would have a large military. 

He said he understands it is not financially or politically possible for many members to meet the target but stressed consolidation to do more with less would also be acceptable. 

Judging by his speech, and subsequent defense officials strongly urging European NATO members to meet their targets, I dont think the US would have a problem with it. In fact, judging by the rhetoric I would think the US would welcome it. I am fairly sure the US sees Germany as a partner more than an adversary.

&gt;__Venetian__ or __Venetan__ is a [Romance language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages) spoken as a native language by over two million people,  mostly in the [Veneto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto) region of [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), where most of the five million inhabitants can understand it. It is sometimes spoken and often well understood outside Veneto, in [Trentino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trentino), [Friuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friuli), [Venezia Giulia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezia_Giulia), [Istria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istria), and some towns of [Dalmatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia), totalling 6–7 million speakers. The language is called ___vèneto___ or ___vènet___ in Venetian, ___veneto___ in Italian; the variant spoken in [Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice) is called ___venexiàn/venesiàn___ or ___veneziano___, respectively. Although referred to as an [Italian dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Italy) (Ven *diałeto*, It *dialetto*) even by its speakers, it is in fact a separate language, not a dialect of Italian.  Venetian differs from Italian in grammar, phonetics, and vocabulary. It is usually classified as a [Western Romance language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Romance_languages), a branch of Romance to which Italian does not belong. Some authors include it among the [Gallo-Italic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallo-Italic_languages),  but by most authors, it is treated as separate. Typologically, Venetian has little in common with the Gallo-Italic languages of northwestern Italy, but shows some affinity to nearby [Istriot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istriot).

Also on the English version, which is consistently more reliable than the Italian version, you can read: ""Although referred to as an Italian dialect even by its speakers, it is in fact a separate language, not a dialect of Italian.""

The consensus on Wikipedia (both the Italian and the English version) it's that Venetian is a language, don't try to fool me by citing one user's opinion a discussion page.

Btw, you should also try to understand things you cite: on the discussion page you cite at the end the Wikipedia users agree on accepting as language only languages with a ISO639 code. Venetian has one:

Ireland had a civil war in 1922 as a result of the Anglo-Irish treaty signed at the end of the War of Independence. Out of that Civil War emerged two main parties Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The only left party at the time the Labour party abstained from the first election of the new state so the population could use it as a referedum on the treaty itself. Since then people have voted along family lines based on what side of the civil war they were on. Essentially we've never had left-right politics.

Traditionally our largest party Fianna Fáil bankrupted our country in 2008/09 and suffered its lowest ever election result of 17% in 2011. Since then our new government of Fine Gael and the Labour party have been getting more and more unpopular. 

This has seen Sinn Féin the party that delivered independence in 1922 which both Fine Gael and Fianna emerged from, seen a rise in the polls. In the last election they polled just under 10% but recent polls have shown them to consistently be around 20%. If they achieve this in an election there'll be no other other but a Fianna Fail/Fine Gael coalition. This would actually properly realign Irish politics as our government would all be right wing and the opposition left wing. This would led to a situation where a left government is a real possibility as opposed to the last 80 years where any left wing parties have only acted a minor partners to prop up right wing governments.",0,1397955238,null,0,false,0,cgwxy82,t3_23g51t,t1_cgwxy82,t1_cgwqldv,null,1433433069,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Schau mal um deiner Gesundheit willen, dass du die Fingerkuppen nicht ständig in der Schnittzone von einem Messer ohne Führung hältst. Ausserdem schneidet man mit einem Messer, man drückt und quetscht Sachen nicht einfach durch.

Effektiv schneidest du btw das Gemüse auf eine sehr ineffiziente Art, bei der du fast die maximale Anzahl an Schnitte für ziemlich bescheidene Würfel benötigst. Kleine Faustregel, immer die größten Schnitte zuerst ausführen, das wäre z.B. bei der Zucchini ein längsseitiges Zerteilen der Zucchini in lange Scheiben, diese dann übereinander gestapelt zu langen Streifen, und diese dann in einem Stück zu Würfeln. Anstatt immer 3-4 Scheiben abzuschneiden und diese dann einzelnt in Würfel zu schneiden.

true,lingxs,altro,,"Ciao sireatalot,

Non so se tu ti riferisca a me credendo che sono un expat in Québec, ma... sono proprio uno del posto! Sono nato e cresciuto in una città di 150 000 abitanti nel nord della provincia. Non è certo una metropoli, e siamo considerati rurali da quelli di Montréal. 

Ovviamente, quindi, me la cavo benissimo con l'accento, giacché è il mio... ;) Più che un accento, è una varietà vera e propria di francese, che è abbastanza differente da far esitare alcuni francesi non preparati che vengono qui. Con pochi sforzi (soprattutto buona volontà e uno snobismo diminuito), riescono benissimo a capirci come del resto capiamo loro senza troppi problemi. È ovvio poi che qualcuno che abbia imparato il francese come seconda lingua al di fuori del Québec non possa avere facilità con la nostra varietà, poiché non se ne parla mai nei corsi di francese. Francese = sempre Francia nella mentalità del mondo, mentre invece il francese è molto più parlato fuori dalla Francia che proprio lì... ;) Sarebbe carino, a volte, far sentire a coloro che apprendono la lingua diversi accenti e diverse varietà di essa. 

Credimi, non si vive affatto male qui. Beh, parlo con un biasimo ovvio, ma... ;)

Se per te Sherbrooke è provincia, beh insomma... È una città di 400 000 abitanti, tipo Bologna, non è tanto piccola, ehehe. Diciamo che è un centro urbano importante. A Montréal hanno un altro tipo di accento (perché poi il Québec si suddivide anche in zone dialettali con più o meno variazioni rispetto a la norma quebecchese dell'orale), ma le differenze son poche con il francese che parlo io. 

Guarda, io ho imparato l'italiano a Roma, essendo in contatto sia con una lingua molto formale, molto standard nei corsi, sia con una lingua più dialettale e popolare fuori dalla scuola. Dopo un po', anche ascoltando i film, penso di esser riuscito a cavarmela bene con l'accento romano (so che non è il più diverso dall'italiano standard, per carità, ma comunque!). Con un po' di tempo, pure tu ti ci saresti abituato. 

Quello che trovo triste è che la mia ragazza ha sempre considerato il mio francese come un diffetto, come una pronuncia scorretta della lingua di Francia, mentre sono ormai 350 anni che si evolvono separatamente. Ti prego di diffondere l'idea che non siamo barbari maleducati e che con le orecchie aperte, ci si sopravvive benissimo dalle nostre parti :). Lavoro in un museo e abbiamo ricevuto alcuni italiani l'estate scorsa: è stato un vero piacere fargli visitare le mostre nella loro lingua. In ricambio hanno ammesso che gli piaceva il francese quebecchese :)

Per quanto riguarda la graduate school, si passa direttamente dall'università: il processo di ammissione, gestito interamente dalle singole università (non c'è una graduatoria nazionale) guarda alle tue lettere di presentazione e al tuo curriculum (più GRE, statement of purpose, etc.) ma non alla nazionalità, almeno sulla carta. Ed è esclusivamente l'università a decidere se vieni ammesso o meno. Una volta ammessi, il visto è painless (se non hai finanziato Hezbollah o Al Quaeda, s'intende): l'università fa richiesta di visto (F-1) per te, vai in consolato, fai tre ore di coda per un'intervista di 15 secondi e tre giorni dopo ti restituiscono il passaporto con l'agognato sticker.

Per l'undergrad sospetto che il processo sia molto simile: solo, visto che è difficile paragonare un CV europeo con uno americano, gli studenti americani sono probabilmente favoriti, non perchè più bravi ma perchè le loro skills sono (i) più vicine a quelle cercate dalle università e (ii) più ``riconoscibili'' dall'admission office, che non ha idea di cosa sia il percorso PNI sperimentazione lingua straniera ma sa cos'è un honor roll.

One leads up to basically a small mountain and goes in the direction of the Sierra Nevada, so the views are really nice. I'm not sure about the other direction, but my roommate goes running in both directions and loves it - they're nice paths with exercise parks. 

If you have a day to spare and want to get out of the city, the mountain villages of the Alpujarras are really nice. The program I'm studying with took us to the three highest villages, and on a clear day, you can see the Mediterranean from there. There are hiking trails clearly marked the whole way, and of course the tapas there are hearty and generous. 

That's another thing. While you're in Granada province, take advantage of free tapas. You don't even need to order a full dinner in Granada to be fed enough to get you through - some places give you enough tapas with your drink (beer or tinto de verano (wine + lemon soda) are pretty much always under 3 euro) and with a couple rounds you'll be set. Granada province is the last part of Spain where it's standard to give free tapas, so whenever I travel somewhere else and get charged for tapas, I scoff and feel slighted. 

If you ever want a beach day, I suggest Nerja. It's full of English and German retirees, but they have a cave there that holds a world record for its huge column. A bus runs regularly from the town directly to the entrance of the caves. There's plenty of beaches, and if you're down to go around some barriers on land or swim along the coast, there are little grottoes that are really pretty. When I went, we easily went past a barrier (everyone does it, it's fine) and ended up chilling up on a rock overlooking a lot of the area. We also drank on the beach at night in one of the little hidden beaches and others had a fire - it was a really nice alternative to normal nights out, and it seems like the night life there is pretty much nonexistent, especially compared to Granada, the city of students.

The problem is the US back yard is the entire globe. Japan wants more presence, SK, Taiwan, ASEAN just spoke with the US about further engagement because of China's expansionist mindset. Europe seems to be more interested in a more engaged US now. Its very taxing (pun intended).

You mention above that NATO is a tax your country has to pay. The problem is, most members are not paying the ""tax"" they agreed to, or even coming near it. When countries in Asia, Europe, etc. ask for a bi-lateral agreement, more and more they seem to mean that the US should foot almost the entire bill. By the time Obama leaves office, estimates put the US defense budget back down to roughly 3% of GDP. This is still fairly high. 

It seems unfair that many countries make promises they never intend to keep to get the US to sign agreements with them, but then expect the same benefits when they have not held up their end of the agreement for a decade or more. 

The highest ranking US defense official said the US could withdraw from NATO if European members dont even make an effort to meet their targets, or at least stop cuts. For the countries, financially or politically, unable he said consolidation could be a valuable tool to do more with less. After Russia invaded a deal was signed between some Eastern countries, but it was a response to Russia's actions, not US requests for providing an actual substantive contribution that every NATO member agreed to.

Most NATO members seem to brush off US requests to meet their contributions, or requests to contribute much of anything, and see NATO as an excuse to slash their defense budgets even further, rather than a tax they have to pay.

Justement, je ne suis pas d'accord. Ce qu'il s'est passé en Islande peut servir d'exemple.

Tout concerne la dette, donc la monnaie. On a 3 choix : soit payer nous mêmes (austérité), soit faire payer nos enfants, soit ne pas rembourser (par l'inflation ou le défaut).

Par contre, je pense que la croissance ne reviendra pas, et qu'on va tous peu à peu s'appauvrir. Reste à s'appauvrir de manière équitable, en ponctionnant les riches.

Pour les multinationales, elles profitent bien d'une situation que l'UE a créé en laissant dans la même zone des paradis fiscaux et des pays qui ont une protection sociale élevée. Sans politique commune, cela ne peut mener qu'à un nivellement par le bas. 

Aux US, ils ont des lois sévères sur le rapatriement de capitaux qui font que Apple ou Google ne peuvent pas utiliser les milliards qu'ils ont au Luxembourg et en Irlande. Je pense qu'on pourrait faire pareil en UE : quand l'argent sort d'un pays, il doit servir à financer les pays les plus pauvres de la zone.

Peu m'importe le discours humaniste, car s'il n'y a pas de fonctionnaires pour donner des papiers et des aides (austérité), cela ne profitera qu'aux gens qui ont le temps d'attendre des heures à la CAF donc accentuer le problème des travailleurs pauvres (clandestins, immigrés légaux ou même Français) déjà en concurrence avec les bas salaires des autres pays européens.",0,1397981055,null,0,false,0,cgx6h64,t3_22qf8w,t1_cgx6h64,t1_cgprx4w,null,1433437152,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

Kyprianou was similar. I can see how Mr Vasiliou was counted as left-wing. While a Liberal Democrat (think ALDE - Mrs Vasiliou is affiliated with it as a Commissioner), he worked with the Working People party and it was about that time some welfare provisions were created,

[Ukraine crisis is EU’s fault](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/10775635/The-BBCs-groupthink-is-an-enemy-to-free-speech.html)

&gt;*One phrase in a piece by one of our most prominent commentators on the great Ukraine imbroglio exemplifies just how the West’s preferred narrative for this shambles is getting the story upside down. Can the West, it asks, make “a last-ditch attempt to deter Russia from its imperialist ambition”? As some of us have long been trying to point out, the trigger to this crisis was not President Putin’s attempt to further Russia’s imperial ambitions, but that of the EU to extend its own empire, right into the heart of a region which Russians see, ethnically and politically, as very much their national concern.*
&gt;*It was the ambition to absorb Ukraine into the EU that finally provoked 96 per cent of Crimean voters to choose to rejoin the country where they belonged through most of the last 230 years. Faced with that hubris exemplified in David Cameron’s boast last year that he wanted to see the EU stretching “from the Atlantic to the Urals”, it is unsurprising that so many of the Russian-speakers in Ukraine’s industrial heartland would prefer to be ruled by Moscow than by some alien government in Brussels.*

&gt;*For 60 years the “European project” has been driven by its ideological belief that the evil of “nationalism” must give way to an undemocratic, unaccountable “supra-nationalism”. But by pushing its “soft power” right up to Russia’s borders, the EU has finally gone a bridge too far. The lesson it shows no sign of learning is that there is still a real world outside its own little bubble of make-believe, where the sense of national identity and national interest cannot just be steamrollered into oblivion.*",0,1397985908,null,0,false,0,cgx79px,t3_23dzv4,t1_cgx79px,t1_cgwv12d,null,1433437526,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I'll give you a loaded answer: take a trip to the suburbs of Paris or the right neighbourhoods of Marseilles and you'll be able to answer your own question.

More serious answer: be polite, speak French, stay out of trouble, don't disturb public order and you'll be fine. 1st gen immigrants are usually decent hard working people, it's their kids failing to integrate that cause the most problems (the common euphemism for them is ""youth""). Quite frankly, I just don't understand how they fail to integrate; they're given everything: housing, transportation, education etc. And still they end up rejecting it. Those who do take their education seriously get good scholarships and end up being normal middle-class people. It's commonly refered to as the ""social elevator""; I know it works, I took it myself.

Where are you from, anyway? If it's Morocco, Algeria or Tunisia you'll find entire communities of your countrymen, which you can use for support, but also use to never really integrate into French society, and that's also a source of problems so don't isolate yourself that way.

As for religion, France has a tradition of laïcité, which can be summarized as ""keep your fucking religion to yourself in public settings"", and a strong separation of Church and state, aka ""fuck you, religion cannot be the basis of law"". As long as you uphold those principles, you'll be fine. Problem is, that implies no religious behaviour or imagery in public establishments (notably schools), and even public places (no wearing burqas on the streets). Somehow, some Muslims have a hard time accepting those notions, probably because they weren't around when they were proclaimed. Every other religious community in France has been massacred before (atheists or pagans killed by Catholics, then Protestants killed by Catholics, then Catholics killed by proto-atheists, then Jews killed by everyone else etc) and now understand that one should leave religion at home.

Anyway, hope this helps.",0,1397987077,null,0,false,0,cgx7fql,t3_23i02v,t1_cgx7fql,t3_23i02v,null,1433437604,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

I have a controversial theory about it. I think that in order for immigrants to integrate they need to be treated like shit. Why I'm saying this? Bear with me.

Let's take immigrant groups who were treated like shit. In my opinion we need to concentrate on mass migrations. I have decided to take as an example Italian and Irish immigrants to the US. They were treated like shit and second class humans. Each had their mobs and all. After heavy discrimination the average Italian and Irish people who weren't criminals realized they can't live like this. That they have to integrate to live like normal human beings because otherwise they'd be treated like shit. And they did. You don't hear about any problems with Italian and Irish communities in the US-because they realized that to live they need to integrate.

Now let's take a look at current immigrants in Europe. Why the Hell would they want to integrate? They have everything given to them **because** they are not integrating. They are given everything-housing, transportation, education etc. I am a strong supporter of the claim that everything is economics. They see how they live nice, how they get away with crime-they're living a life of privilege. They want that life so no reason to integrate.

true,kinzkopf,flag-de,,"""Dem Christentum wird ebenfalls nachgesagt, es sei eine kulturelle Zwangsjacke. Angeblich zwingt es Menschen aus ganz verschiedenen Kulturen in ein Prokrustesbett und ist ein Feind von Pluralismus und Multikulturalismus. Tatsache ist, dass das Christentum sich gegenüber den unterschiedlichen Kulturen als flexibler (und vielleicht auch weniger destruktiv) erwiesen hat als der Säkularismus und viele andere Weltanschauungen.
  
Die Ausbreitung des Christentums ist ganz anders erfolgt als bei den anderen Weltreligionen. Das Zentrum des Islams liegt noch heute in seiner Wiege – dem Nahen Osten. Die Länder, die die ersten demografischen Zentren des Hinduismus, Buddhismus und Konfuzianismus waren, sind auch heute noch deren Zentren. Ganz anders das Christentum: Anfangs wurde es von Judenchristen dominiert und sein Zentrum lag in Jerusalem. Später war es griechisch-hellenistisch dominiert und sein Zentrum verlagerte sich in den nördlichen Mittelmeerraum. Noch später wurde es von den „Barbaren“ des westlichen und nördlichen Europa angenommen, und sein Zentrum fand sich nun in West- und Mitteleuropa und schließlich auch in Nordamerika. Heute lebt die Mehrheit der Christen in Afrika, Lateinamerika und Asien, und schon bald werden die Zentren des Christentums im Süden und Osten der Welt liegen.
  
Im Jahre 1900 waren ganze 9 Prozent der Afrikaner Christen, und auf einen Christen kamen vier Muslime. Heute machen die Christen 44 Prozent der afrikanischen Bevölkerung aus; in den 1960er-Jahren überholte das Christentum den Islam. Zurzeit erleben wir ein explosionsartiges Wachstum der Kirchen in China, wo das Christentum nicht nur unter den Bauern wächst, sondern auch im sozialen und kulturellen Establishment, bis hin zur Kommunistischen Partei. Wenn das gegenwärtige Wachstum sich fortsetzt, werden in ca. 30 Jahren die Christen 30 Prozent der dann 1,5 Milliarden Menschen zählenden chinesischen Bevölkerung ausmachen.  
Warum ist das Christentum in diesen Ländern so enorm gewachsen? Der afrikanische Forscher Lamin Sanneh gibt eine höchst interessante Antwort. Er sagt, dass die Afrikaner eine lange Tradition des Glaubens an eine übernatürliche Welt guter und böser Geister haben. Als sie anfingen, die Bibel in ihrer eigenen Sprache zu lesen, erkannten viele in Christus die große, endgültige Lösung ihrer eigenen historischen Sehnsüchte und Hoffnungen als Afrikaner. Sanneh schreibt:
  
""Das Christentum beantwortete diese historische Herausforderung mit einer Reorientierung der Weltanschauung … Die Menschen spürten in ihrem Herzen, dass Jesus ihre Hochachtung vor dem Heiligen und ihre Sehnsucht nach einem unbesiegbaren Retter nicht verspottete, und so schlugen sie ihre heiligen Trommeln für ihn, bis die Sterne am Himmel zu tanzen begannen. Nach diesem Tanz waren die Sterne nicht mehr klein und unbedeutend. Das Christentum half den Afrikanern, neue Afrikaner zu werden, und nicht umgemodelte Europäer.""
  
Sanneh argumentiert, dass der Säkularismus mit seinem Antisupernaturalismus und Individualismus die einheimischen Kulturen und die afrikanische Identität viel mehr bedroht als das Christentum. In der Bibel lesen die Afrikaner von der Macht Jesu über die übernatürlichen, geistlichen Mächte des Bösen und wie er am Kreuz über sie triumphierte. Wenn Afrikaner Christen werden, wird ihre afrikanische Identität bekehrt, vervollständigt, erneuert und nicht durch eine europäische Identität oder was auch immer ersetzt. Der christliche Glaube gibt den Afrikanern die nötige Distanz, ihre Traditionen zu kritisieren, ohne sie abzulegen.""

* Politis Daily traces 2ml EUR in bribes by Vgenopoulos (the Marfin banker who allegedly crashed Laiki-Cyprus Popular Bank to the ground) to the two main political parties, during the period of 2007-2008. According to the newspapers, Vgenopoulos, through a subsidiary ('Focus'), bribed then-governing AKEL with 1.5ml EUR, and the main opposition DISY with 0.5ml EUR. After Laiki was taken over by Marfin (during AKEL's reign) Laiki— formerly a conservative bank, was allowed to expand fast and with high risk, until its collapse last year. Cyprus' party campaign finance does not allow auditors to examine party transcactions of previous years. The implicated parties, auditor office and Vgenopoulos deny any relation, with the governing DISY party adding that “we don't have the money, but we will return them anyway” [[P]](http://www.politis-news.com/cgibin/hweb?-A=262296&amp;-V=articles) [[Ph]](http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/eidiseis-politiki/39/195174/elegktiko-grafeio-diapseydei-tis-apokalypseis-gia-tin-focus) [[Ph]](http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/eidiseis-politiki/39/195447/anadromikos-elenchos-den-yparchei-gia-tous-logariasmous-ton-kommaton)

The Church was inaccessible to Christians for 50 years after the division, but the mayors of the Greek and Turkish sector of Famagusta reached an agreement to hold mass on Good Friday, on St George's nameday and on May 4.  Not everyone welcomed this agreement: The Turkish Resistance Organisation found it offensive and managed to get the Turkish mayor restrict the area of the event, but also the Greek Cypriot political parties DIKO, EDEK, EVROKO, Greens and Citizens Coalition took a stance against it and did not attend.

For those wondering: Greece distributes the questions of the Panhellenic Exams using the [IP over Vertical Blanking Interval](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2728) protocol. To keep it simple: it's like teletext, but it is encrypted, and it's decoded by a computer. ERT of course was the only television station with the mandate to cover 100% of the Greek population. 

I guess that idea was fair for its time, since Greece had abysmal ADSL coverage up to 10 years ago, and still does in the most remote areas (lots of mountains and little islands in Greece). It secured that every school receives the questions at nearly the same time, and that only authorised personnel had the key to decode the data. 

But I think this can be safely replaced by ADSL and Satellite internet nowadays, with an even stronger encryption. The cost will probably be lower.

Sono stato sorpresissimo di scoprire che anche considerando l'area urbana, Sherbrooke non supera i 205 000... Wow. La mia città arriva subito dopo per popolazione, con circa 150 000, essendo la settima nella provincia. 

È vero che non c'è paragone con Montréal, che è quindici volte più popolata...

Sarà perché venendo di un piccolo centro, le città di 200k + mi sembrano mostruosamente grandi. Beh, anche da 50k+... Viterbo mi risultava caotica e gigantesca dopo averci passato un giorno, quando si sa che è solo un piccolo capoluogo di provincia. 

La differenza tra l'accento di Montréal e quello di Sherbrooke è piccola; non la saprei fare neanch'io, anche perché le variazioni tendono a diminuire con la crescita di Sherbrooke, che non è molto lontana dalla metropoli. 

Avevo capito che non volevi sparlare :P È un argomento molto importante per me, semplicemente, che la nostra varietà sia considerata valida quanto quella di Francia, ma non avrei dovuto parlarne su un forum italiano perché c'entra davvero poco. È normalissimo che vi insegnino la varietà francese, perché è ancora quella che ha il maggiore impatto culturale attraverso tutta la francofonia internazionale. Poi, se si considera che l'Italia ha la Francia proprio accanto, diventerebbe un non-sense insegnare la varietà quebecchese (a proposito, penso che stia inventando un termine qui... l'ho già visto qualche volta, ma spesso si dice ""del Québec"" per evitare l'aggettivo non formato). 

L'inglese, stranamente, non ha un influenza enorme sul nostro francese come si vorrebbe far credere alle volte. Di certo ha un effetto su come parliamo ma poco, perché su tutto il territorio siamo in maggioranza (+di 80% di francofoni in Québec). Non ci si sente ""minacciati"" nella lingua qui (beh c'è chi dirà di sì, e avrà forse ragione a Montréal, ma non di certo in provincia).

The terminology differences tripped me up at first. They wouldn't call what you want a visa as we in the US might think of it. 

Basically, you have 3 months after arrival to apply to extend your stay.

true,ClitDoctorMD,IREL,Ireland,"&gt;my point was that this hasn't always been the case historically as both parties have moved around the spectrum

Post independence both were extremely conservative. The Cumann na nGaedheal (the party FG grew out of) government agreed to implement catholic policy in exchange for church support during the civil war. Likewise FF's rise to power was largely based on their backing from the Irish College in the Vatican. Both were extremely conservative. For instance divorce which was previously available was banned, likewise with contraception. The censorship board was set up to curtail was the Irish public had access to. At a time where in England there was a move away from the industrial school model which clearly didnt work Irish governments followed it. Another example of this is the setting up of the welfare state in Britain and the expansion of social policies and the creation of the NHS by Clement Atlee and the Labour Party was never replicated in Ireland. 

&gt; FG may be ultra conservative now, but in the 80s they led what was arguably the most liberal government we ever had.
 
As for Fitzergald's premiership the only stand out liberal policy was the introduction of a referendum on divorce. Its economic policies akin to those advocated by Thatcher and Regan under neo-liberalism with tried to let the market control the economy, resulting in mass emigration and unemployment during the tenure of the government. Arguably the introduction of the abortion legislation is just as liberal as the aforementioned divorce one. Also when you consider next year we're likely to have a referendum on gay marriage I dont see how you can describe the current FG as ultra conservative and 80s FG as liberal. That is unless you're talking about economically rather than socially.

&gt;It's a dumb system, and people are increasingly fed up with it as we can see from the huge support for independents in recent polls. But knowing our luck, FF will return to power at the next election and the cycle will repeat.

Its not a dumb system its the peoples fault, infact proportional representation by single transferable vote is one of the best and fairest voting systems in the world. As for FF back in power we need them in government with FG to realign Irish politics on a left-right spectrum like the rest of the world. Todays opinion polls have FF and FG polling at a combined 41% vs 59% for SF/LAB/Ind so that government is a distinct possibility especially when you consider both will be reluctant to share power with SF.",0,1398000751,null,0,false,0,cgx9sk2,t3_23g51t,t1_cgx9sk2,t1_cgx99cg,null,1433438714,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

There was a serious concern that Gaddafi would slaughter civilians. A lot of promises were made to make that it would be a mission to strictly protect civilians. Since China usually votes with Russia they abstained as well. Once he got that, NATO violated that treaty openly and didn't even bother to play nice with both of them. Instead of protecting civilians NATO became the airforce of the rebels and ignored as pro-government civilians and african migrant workers were murdered. A perfect example was when France airdropped weapons to rebels. Lavrov asked for an explanation for the violation. Rasmussen denied that NATO knew about it. France said NATO knew about it and that they did nothing wrong. The US used a line in the resolution that said that all means can be used to defend civilians has an excuse for ignoring the rest of the resolution. It didn't really help things when those weapons weren't being used defensively.

That didn't go down well in both countries and Medvedev looked like an utter fool. Putin had to step in and stop him from being insulted.

That is why Russia and China have been very strong and firm when it comes to Syria. They're are not willing to give a single inch and any resolution that has a single ambigious line that would allow the West to intervene is vetoed.

true,TheGodBen,IREL,Ireland,"&gt; Also when you consider next year we're likely to have a referendum on gay marriage I dont see how you can describe the current FG as ultra conservative and 80s FG as liberal.

I see the gay marriage referendum as somewhat reactionary. If the polls can be believed, public support is heavily is favour, and all major political parties support it. That's a referendum intended to bring the law in line with public opinion, it's not one attempting to drive public opinion in a more liberal direction. That's where I see the Fitzgerald government as more liberal, they were trying to introduce liberal social policies at a time when Ireland was still entrenched with a Catholic conservative mindset, which is why the first divorce referendum failed.

&gt;Its not a dumb system its the peoples fault, infact proportional representation by single transferable vote is one of the best and fairest voting systems in the world.

Don't get me wrong, I quite like our voting system, I'm not criticising that. The problem is the people who vote for a party because that's the party their father voted for, because that's the party *his* father voted for, because that's the side *his* father fought in during the civil war. I was hoping the 2011 election would bring an end to that, and I'm hoping that the 2016 election may bring an end to it too.

Pour un papier j'ai réussi à jouer les séniors entre eux et l'envoyer. Pour un autre, qui me tenait à coeur, j'ai mis une date limite de révision (un délai d'une semaine si je me rappelle bien), et j'ai envoyé le papier à la date limite que j'avais fixée. Bien que ce dernier papier ait été mon deuxième soumis, il a été le premier accepté. L'autre était soumis à un journal très lent (je ne pense plus que de tels délais existent en biologie avec le web : plus d'1 an pour publier).

J'ai fait l'essentiel de la rédaction de mes premiers papiers, et un autre résultat de mon impatience avec mes collaborateurs séniors a été de me mettre en auteur correspondant dès mon premier papier.

Un truc qui a été un peu stressant était d'attendre les revues et acceptations éventuelles alors que je soumettais ma thèse et cherchait un postdoc avec zéro papiers acceptés 6 mois avec la date limite. Finalement je m'en suis sorti. :-)

Pour répondre aux questions posées :
- mon premier papier m'a pris super longtemps (6 mois à temps partiel, dont un été à temps plein), mais c'est une expérience nécessaire, et j'essaye de toujours laisser le temps à mes doctorants d'écrire leur premier papier eux-mêmes même si ça prend un temps frustrant pour le directeur de thèse.

Müssen wir Michelangelos persönliche Frömmigkeit beurteilen, um die Sixtinische Kapelle zu bewundern? Oder sind Tolkiens Schriften ""christlich"" nur weil er katholisch war? Ganz allgemein, sogar unter Evangelikalen muss man irgendwie die christliche Aussage der Kunst gegenüber ihren künstlerischen Wert messen. Meiner Erachtung, im Sinne dieses Artikels, was gilt als christliche Kultur ist eine Kultur, worin Menschen christliche Kunst- und Denkmotiven verstehen und sich auf diesen Themen (auch wenn polemisch) beziehen können--worin es eine gewisse theologische Bildung (eng. literacy?) gibt.
