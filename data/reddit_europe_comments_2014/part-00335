They ought to form their union because otherwise they would always be the junior partners ruled by people vastly different to them. They ought to be our friends and allies eventually, but independent. 

Yes we should be confined (largely) to Europe. Otherwise we would be too powerful, the state would be so vast (and would probably expand to the entire world) as to be permanently unaccountable to it's own people or international opinion, cultures would blur and be lost, there would be nowhere to flee from tyranny there would be no effective balances or blocks to a person who ruled the whole world. The world can never be allowed to unite, it simply endangers liberty too much, and that's the slippery slope that taking on nations of different cultures and regions would start.

Da die Language ideology von der modernen Linguistik geprägt ist, rechne ich kaum damit, dass es da gute Erfolge gibt. Was mit der Korpuslinguistik geschehen ist, kann man ja an Herrn Prof. Stefanowitsch erkennen. Unwissenschaftlichkeit und Polemik, lesen Sie mal seinen Blog. (Sprachlog)

Weil du anscheinend nicht selbst denken kannst:
&gt;Während es ungewiss bleibt, ob der männliche 
Partner selber erwerbstätig ist und auf welcher Basis sich die Familie ernährt, wird 
weibliche Erwerbstätigkeit hingegen als abwegig beschrieben.
Falsch.

Wer die Blogposts liest, erkennt dass das Streben nach Karriere zu Lasten der Familie generell schlecht ist. Es wird nur die Zweizüngigkeit angeprangert, die beinhaltet, dass männliche Erwerbsarbeit nicht als Familienleistung zählt, weibliche aber schon. [mantau](http://man-tau.blogspot.de/)

&gt;Andererseits sind sie Täterinnen, weil sie sich aus angeblicher Gier und Streben nach Selbstverwirklichung dem kapitalistischen System in die Arme werfen.

Was daran ist falsch? Es wird dabei kein Hehl daraus gemacht, dass Männer, die sich dem kapitalistischem Streben hingeben, auch Täterinnen sind. Das wird in dem Text leider unterschlagen.

&gt;So dient letztendlich die traditionelle Kleinfamilie
mitsamt romantisierter Väter- und Mutterrollen als Ankerpunkt der Kritik an Frauenförderung
und dem befürchteten Machtverlust von Männern.

Darüber muss man jetzt aber wirklich lachen, oder? Es geht nicht darum, dass es Frauenprogramme gibt, sondern darum dass es keine Männerprogramme gibt. Habt ihr schon von der Förderungen von männlichen Grundschullehrern gesehen, so groß wie die Initiativen für Frauen in MINT-Fächer? Und obwohl Männer 40% Opfer aller häuslichen Gewalt sind, ist das Verhältnis von Beratungsangeboten 1:1000. Im Krieg sterben zu mehr als 80% Männer, aber Frauen seien die wahren Opfer im Krieg. (UN-Konvention)

&gt;Denn einerseits beklagen Maskulisten [...] weibliche Macht im privaten Bereich. Andererseits werden Frauenförderungen
auf dem Arbeitsmarkt, und somit der Weg aus der Privatheit, als ungerecht
angeprangert.

Das ist falsch, es ist die feministische Gewalt im Öffentlichen (Medien), weswegen die Frauenförderprogramme unsinnig erscheinen (im Kontrast dazu, dass es keine Männerförderprogramme gibt).

Sure. You think Crimeans would have been allowed this referendum under Ukrainian jurisdiction? It's no different or no significantly different in that regard.

&gt; I'm going to make the case that a larger, centralized government is not necessarily the stronger one in the face of foreign or private corruption. An argument could be made that foreign powers and private entities prefer having to deal with one sovereign government, than five - knowing that the one is just as unlikely to resist them as each of the smaller ones.

In the end, if a country the size of Belgium, or Catalonia, wanted to introduce such norms, the company might say it's better off not operating in it, while the Union is another prospect altogether. People say power tends to corrupt. The truth is powerless corrupts just as much, if not more. For a sample, all the postcolonial countries.

Diese Lügengeschichte stinkt ja bis zum Himmel. Fakt ist:

1. Wenn man sein Profil anschaut und seine Posts durchgeht, sind ausschließlich die gelöscht worden in denen er sich über die Hetze der ÖRR beschwert, der erste vor 10(!) Tagen.

2. Der Nutzer wurde nicht unverzüglich nach der Löschung gebanned, vor 13h wurde dieser Thread eröffnet, die Löschung seiner rundfunkkritischen Beiträge erfolgte also noch früher. Zwei Stunden nach der Eröffnung postete /u/100ProzentAfD sogar noch einmal, das heißt er war auch zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch nicht gebanned.
http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/2lnt2l/frage_an_die_mods_was_wird_hier_eigentlich/clwj8xc

3. Die anderen Beiträge sind immer noch lesbar.

Was schließen wir daraus? Es wurden durch den Moderator selektiv Beiträge zensiert, die gegen den ÖRR gingen. Als dies herauskam wurde der User gebanned um eine plausible Geschichte zu konstruieren und von der Zensur abzulenken.

Hätte man sich wirklich daran gestört, hätte man alle Beiträge des /u/100ProzentAfD gelöscht und ihn sofort gebanned, als das ""agenda setting"" offenbar wurde bzw. ihn einfach gebanned und die Beiträge stehen gelassen.

Der verantwortliche Moderator sollte umgehend abgelöst werden. Ein derartiger Machtmissbrauch zur Unterdrückung von Meinungen ist alles andere als eine Lappalie.

I'm not arguing Crimeans *would have been* allowed the referendum, I'm arguing they *should have been* allowed the right to have a proper democratic referendum - as should the Catalans, and everybody else in the world in a similar position. And not just the one time either (the way UK thinks referendums work).

&gt; I think this is generally empirically false (there may be the odd exception). If nothing else, scale confers power. We often see this regarding the EU, in that the Union's size allows it to effectively impose standards and judgements to large companies that small states wouldn't get away with. In the end, if a country the size of Belgium, or Catalonia, wanted to introduce such norms, the company might say it's better off not operating in it, while the Union is another prospect altogether. People say power tends to corrupt. The truth is powerless corrupts just as much, if not more. For a sample, all the postcolonial countries.

United States government is hardly an ""odd exception"".

Our railways used to be state owned too, worked perfectly and it was regarded as one of the most efficient and reliable railways in the world. 

Now it;s a company, eventhough the government is the only share holder, it suffers disaster after disaster. Mismanagement, huge procurement errors (Fyra) and a train ticket now officially costs about the same as driving two american pick ups to the same destination.

As for the gas/electricity/water, thank god that's still state. I pay 1,5 Euro for 1000 liter of drinking water (the cleanest tap drinking water in the world) and somehow that state company is making so much profit that it's doing all sort of development work from it in Africa. 

Perhaps England and other countries don't have a very well functioning (semi)public sector, we had. Actually, public sector is all that this nation was. 

For every thing made private, the country crawls a step backwards, and everything gets worse. 

Yes Healthcare Insurance is now private, all praise the lords. 8 billion Euro of annual corruption in 2013, 4 billion Euro profit (1788% rise in profit) over 2013, putting that by the numer of people insured (everyone 18+ so roughly 12 million people) that's about all we pay for our Insurance. Ooh, and did I forget the monthly payments are increasing 2015? The insurances have a reserve of 8 billion Euro, twice the legal amount (4 billion). But it's not enough, they want more. Now, health care Insurance are buying government bonds. Sigh.


I'm not for a complete public market, on the contrary. But there are clear lines, somethings should be free market, somethings should public. Electricity, water, gas, Healthcare, public transit etc. that should be public, and private is Always worse here. As the current situation is the living proof.

Another example is our electricy network, government owned, government maintained and innovated, it's among the most reliable energy networks in the world.

The Holocaust butchered this idea, it butchered the idea of progress; the entire forefront of technology, logistics and modern civilisation, that which was meant to be the salvation of mankind; was being used to carry out the same barbarism which existed in the hearts of men 10,000 years ago.

In the city of Donetsk and in Makeevka (25km north-east of Donetsk city), in “DPR”-controlled territory, the SMM observed convoys of heavy weapons and tanks. At the time of reporting, the SMM could hear heavy, outgoing shelling to the north and northwest of the city’s outskirts, which had started at 14:45hrs.

Detail

At 13:55hrs, on the eastern outskirts of Makeevka (25km north-east of Donetsk), within territory under control of the “Donetsk People’s Republic” (“DPR”), the SMM observed a convoy of more than 40 trucks and tankers moving west on highway H-21.

Of these 19 were large trucks – Kamaz type, covered, and without markings or number plates – each towing a 122mm howitzer and containing personnel in dark green uniforms without insignia. Fifteen were Kraz troop carriers. The SMM was on the move and could therefore not ascertain the contents of these. The remaining six were small fuel tankers, fitted with cranes. The SMM observed an unmarked BTR armoured personnel carrier leading the convoy, with a tarpaulin over the gun.

At 15:20hrs, at the intersection of Leninskyi Street and Kuprin Street (7km south-west of Donetsk city centre) the SMM observed a convoy of nine tanks – four T72 and five T64 – moving west, also unmarked.",0,1415486034,null,0,false,0,clwydzu,t3_2lpfnc,t1_clwydzu,t3_2lpfnc,null,1426122541,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Pride and revenge are just official reasons, most wars in the middle east are fought out of necessity.

&gt;I'm not saying their race is inferior or anything, they are not, but their culture glorifies war a lot more than our western culture does (at least since WW2), or are you going to deny that ? Many conflicts in the middle east come from religious extremism and clash of ideals, not because of resources.

You mix up cause and effect, they glorify war because they need to convince people to fight. Jews historically had an anti-war society but the moment we started to need fighting men we managed to become a military minded society in two-three decades. The ideals, religious extremism and all the other reasons, they are just fed by poverty and scarcity of resources. Saudi Arabia is probably more extreme religiously than Syria, both government and population, yet they have not been embroiled in internal wars or even many external wars, because they are filthy rich.

false,SomebodyReasonable,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt;  What is your take on the NL though? It only spends 1.3% on defense.

I think that's too little. But I noticed something else... Let me look that up... Yes, this table is great:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_the_European_Union#The_table

Sorting on GDP per head or even number of troops, NL is surprisingly high on that list. But then again, compared to NATO spending requirements, it may be that everybody is looking at everybody else and we're looking at herd behavior. They'll only spend more if everybody else spends more first.

&gt; Given that it has consistently made cuts and failed to meet its NATO commitments, do you feel the alliance still has the same responsibilities towards the NL?

We have been with the U.S. and U.K. in Afghanistan, Libya, Yugoslavia and Iraq, so yes, I think so. The Iraq coalition was thinly spread.

&gt;  If the NL was expelled would you consider it fair or unfair?

Unfair. Look it where it stands in the table if you sort as explained above.

&gt; The NL is one of the richest countries in the world on a per capita basis. It is hard to argue it can not meet the %GDP target NATO members agreed to.

I agree. But surely you know about the 3% budget deficit norm which governs the EU these days? We don't have the budget, and believe it or not, we've severely cut back on welfare state and we've privatized everything, something I'm against. The Eurozone is in crisis. I feel we should tax the rich and the corporations and use that to fund defense spending.

But when you talk about defense spending an % of GDP, you absolutely must think about the 3% deficit norm governing the EZ. It is the only thing that matters to EU leaders. Seriously. Personally I think it's an unhealthy fixation, but who am I, right?

&gt; I am American, which is why I fail to see why the US should be shouldering so much of the burden for a European problem.

Then reduce your defense spending? We should increase. 

Thing is, I don't think the military industrial complex in the United States is unhappy with this state affairs at all. It's a bonanza.

&gt; Brits and French people have expressed similar feelings, although both of those nations are still closer in proximity to the problem in Ukraine, and are EU members.

I think this is what the Wikipedia table tells me. In terms of per capita defense spending, the Netherlands ranks 5th, behind France, the UK, Denmark and Finland. So, in terms of the financial burden each Dutch citizen carries, we are above EU average, as the table shows. But in terms of % of GDP, we're lower? What does this mean?

I think it means that if we want to spend even more, we should probably finance it from corporate tax. But what would that mean for the health of the economy? Greece is doing great in terms of % of GDP. They're 6th. Are they not doing more harm than good with that right now? What good is a large % of GDP if you harm you economic stability and financial reserves in the process?

&gt; The general consensus on this sub one year ago was the US needs to close its bases and leave. I fully supported that given the fact it seemed the bases were not wanted. 

I think that makes sense. Germany is sovereign nation now. But then we must step up to the plate and spend more. 

And Germany can do so much more.

&gt; Now there seems to be an expectation that the US be more involved despite the fact many European NATO members have not met their obligations to years or decades.

I don't feel that expectation. And on my part, I'm growing a bit tired of the ""you need us, or you will perish"" routine; after a while, it starts to feel as though the U.S. actually needs the European military dependency more than it wants to get rid of it. In other words, it's as if there is some American insecurity and apprehension about a more assertive Europe as well as discontent about a militarily timid Europe.

All in all, though, I feel your criticism about defense spending is correct, but it needs to be desimplified, because simplification in this case breeds irritation. Yes, more spending is a must, but it isn't as easy, because economic power is a precondition to all geopolitical power and military industrial capacity, and blind spending increases might harm that power.",0,1415486359,null,0,1415486557,0,clwyj33,t3_2lkn0y,t1_clwyj33,t1_clwuf0z,null,1426122474,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Maybe they're hiding behind France and Germany and want them to carry a bigger load. So far I don't see that Germany or France did less than the others.

I heard some Russian say once ""The West is a poker player, Putin is a chess player, he looks further that it's next move.""

I actually found that a surprisingly fit figure of speech. As indeed, Russia is ahead of the West at every turn it seems. 

Then again the West is not sacred. The only thing we can blame the West for is stirring up the hive during a protest. I'm fairly certain that contributed to Russia's stance. A nation that has been backed into a corner for 2,5 decades now, decaying by the day, Putin has now sufficiently stirred up nationalism, and has tremendous support at home.

&gt;__Joan of Arc__ ([French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): *Jeanne d'Arc*,  IPA: [ʒan daʁk]; ca. 1412  – 30 May 1431), nicknamed ""__The Maid of Orléans__"" ([French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): *La Pucelle d'Orléans*), is considered a heroine of France and a [Roman Catholic saint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_saint). She was born to a [peasant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasant) family at [Domrémy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domr%C3%A9my-la-Pucelle) in north-east France. Joan said she received visions of the [Archangel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archangel) [Michael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_(archangel\)), Saint Margaret and Saint Catherine instructing her to support [Charles VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VII_of_France) and recover France from English domination late in the [Hundred Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War). The uncrowned King Charles VII sent Joan to the [siege of Orléans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Orl%C3%A9ans) as part of a relief mission. She gained prominence after the siege was lifted in only nine days. Several additional swift victories led to Charles VII's coronation at [Reims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reims). On 23 May 1430, she was captured at [Compiègne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compi%C3%A8gne) by the allied English-[Burgundian faction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundian_(party\)). She was later handed over to the English,  and then put on trial by the pro-English Bishop of Beauvais [Pierre Cauchon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Cauchon) on a variety of charges.  After Cauchon declared her guilty she was [burned at the stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_by_burning) on 30 May 1431, dying at about nineteen years of age.

And then there's problem with sickness that could be cured cheaply if it was found early, but people weren't insured so they only found out later, so they deal with it for a moment, have complications and opt-in and everybody pay the higher costs for the rest of their lives.

In healthcare consequences are costly (and spill to others very often), prevention is cheap.

Then there are problems with herd immunity - some sicknesses could be completely wiped out in country, but when people don't vaccinate they linger and cause costs for everybody.

Then there are problems with people delaying going to a doctor so the weaker antibiotics won't work on them, so they need stronger antibiotics and plagues get resistances, and everybody need to use stronger antibiotics, and eventually there are sicknesses that could be cured before, but can't be cured now.


Healthcare works much better and is much cheaper when it is always-on system with early diagnosis, prevention, and periodical checks, than when it's ""on-demand"".


BTW I do agree there should be small fee to see a doctor (1 zł should be enough IMHO), and there should be more obligatory tests and they should be more frequent.

And nother BTW - I think we could use IT, internet, smartphones to make the healthcare orders of magnitude more efficient.

For example - get all countries in the world to pay peanuts to develop cheap computer chip with chemical sensors. Force smartphone producers to put the chip in every one. Finance open-source drivers and apps to check for common health problems. Economy of scale will make it very cheap (if everybody buy it it's cheap to make), under few USD per device, and software will be effectively free in the long run.

Then everybody would have early detection device in smartphone. Imagine what that would do to preventable problems (like high cholesterol, liver problems, early diabetes stages, maybe even some kinds of early cancers). That could save lives of millions of people in first few years.

Or imagine if we did global annonymised database of images with diagnoses - people could take a photo and click one button and have result that says ""15% chance of skin cancer - go see doctor"", or ""0.1% of skin cancer - don't bother if it doesn't grow"".

This is already possible, and we spend money on putting cat photos on internet instead :/",0,1415487502,null,0,1415489713,0,clwz0td,t3_2loyyf,t1_clwz0td,t1_clwxajq,null,1426122246,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Rich people were not all born into wealth nor are they evil devil incarnates. Many worked hard, much harder then most of us ever will for their wealth and to ask them to share it with those who have never lifted a finger is selfish and greedy. And even if you take from someone, who will you take from? How will you determine what is very important for people's lives? You cannot, because what is good for some is bad for others. Because economical interactions and many other traits of individuals are involved. No one has the ability to comprehend the vastness of this, especially some socialist ideologues. Why is it madness to privatise? Do you know or is this ideology talking?

So, you would rather live in a country where we would be more equal by wealth and all be poorer as we have seen in socialist countries. Such a state is far more unfair than the state we have now. A thought experiment is perhaps necessary: Think about a factory worker living in a country with low income inequality, his income is comparable to a university professor. Tell me now, what will be the factory worker's motivation to get promoted, to better himself, to be productive, when he is payed as much as someone who is more productive, who (in the past) had put much more resources to climb up the social ladder. And what is the lawyers motivation not to move out of this country? Is it his altruistic nature? You said people are selfish and greedy yourself!

Laws exist today to regulate the parts of a society which the free market cannot. I do not see why some people still see a classic liberal doctrine as anarchy. It is not, and even the foremost proponent of classic liberalism in the late 20th century (M. Friedman) stressed the importance of laws regulating what cannot be entrusted to the free market. And believe it or not, it is not just you who isn't allowed to steal, but also private companies. As I have explained, in socialism, these rules do not exist. A few individuals control the economy of the state and have their own political and personal agendas - the opportunities for nepotism and corruption are abundant. And by looking at history, you can see I am 100% correct. Corruption and nepotism have been far more rampart in communist countries than capitalist.

You see, a socialist government cannot stand alone. In order for socialism to work as it supposed to (unfairly and corruptly as described in this and my previous comments), the whole world need be socialist. And that will not happen, not in the near future, untill there won't be a shortage of goods in this world. Then, and then only could socialism be feasable as there would be no demand and redistribution (even unfair) would be the only possible route to take.

&gt;After their expulsion from Mecca, the Muslims fought the Meccan Quraysh at the Battle of Badr in 624,[7] and at the Battle of Uhud in 625.[8] Although the Muslims neither won nor were defeated at the Battle of Uhud, their military strength was gradually growing. In April 626 Muhammad raised a force of 300 men and 10 horses to meet the Quraysh army of 1,000 at Badr for the second time. Although no fighting occurred, the coastal tribes were impressed with Muslim power. Muhammad also tried, with limited success, to break up many alliances against the Muslim expansion. Nevertheless, he was unable to prevent the Meccan one.[9]

&gt;As they had in the battles of Badr and Uhud, the Muslim army again used strategic methods against their opponents (at Badr, the Muslims surrounded the wells, depriving their opponents of water; at the Battle of Uhud, Muslims made strategic use of the hills). In this battle they dug a trench to render the enemy cavalry ineffective.[10]

&gt;Reason for battle[edit]
The reason for this battle was to defend Medina from attack, after Banu Nadir and Banu Qaynuqa tribes formed an alliance with the Quraysh to attack him as revenge for expelling them from Medina during the Invasion of Banu Qaynuqa and Invasion of Banu Nadir.[11][12] The Muslim scholar Ibn Kathir states: ""The reason why the Confederates came was that a group of the leaders of the Jews of Banu Nadir, whom the Messenger of Allah had expelled from Al-Madinah to Khaybar, including Sallam bin Abu Al-Huqayq, Sallam bin Mishkam and Kinanah bin Ar-Rabi`, went to Makkah where they met with the leaders of Quraysh and incited them to make war against the Prophet"" [13]

Washington Post, the source, tends to keep the propagandistic rhetoric at a miminum. They produced this map mostly by gathering qualitative data in the form of asking people one question. ""One thing the Harvard Institute authors did with all that data was measure it for what they call ethnic fractionalization. Another word for it might be diversity. They gauged this by asking an elegantly simple question: If you called up two people at random in a particular country and ask them their ethnicity, what are the odds that they would give different answers? The higher the odds, the more ethnically ""fractionalized"" or diverse the country.""

In other words, if I stopped a French citizen and asked him the ethnicity he belongs to then I would have to record the one he accepts for himself. He might be a reptiloid for all they care, but they will take into consideration only his perception.

But the problem as mentioned is that the public is still arguing about who is at fault, and nobody even knows what is going on. 

I'm fairly certain that doesn't provide firm public support for any NATO movements. And that's what I think is the most dangerous part.

The Russian army may be just a shadow of what it once was, if it where to attack now, it could reach the German border in two or three weeks without much of resistance.

It would take NATO at least a month to organize any force capable of resisting such an offensive. 

To give you an idea, at this moment, the German airforce has about 40 operational combat jets in Germany. Army's are spread over the entire globe, US presence in Europe is nearly nill and strictly symbolic in terms of actual military movement, and the European military power is centered in Western Europe.

false,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt; They'll only spend more if everybody else spends more first.

That is part of the problem. Although Russia kicked the NL into gear. The NL has committed to spending more, although, as with all these NATO commitments, we will have to see if it materializes.

&gt;Unfair. Look it where it stands in the table if you sort as explained above.

I agree, some nations are not even making a marginal effort. I would fully support a mechanism to expel nations after X amount of years where they have not met commitments. I would also fully support substantial leeway to help them meet it. I certainly would not support expelling anyone after a year or two of not meeting their agreements. But I feel it is the only way to get European NATO members to increase expenditure. As you said, there is little incentive to do it unless others also are. 

&gt;We don't have the budget, and believe it or not, we've severely cut back on welfare state and we've privatized everything, something I'm against. The Eurozone is in crisis. I feel we should tax the rich and the corporations and use that to fund defense spending.

I am definitely aware of the 3% constraint and the fact many countries are in crisis. That is why I think there should be substantial leeway given. But the status quo of doing nothing and having no plan on how to meet goals is not helping. Despite what this sub thinks, the highest ranking US Defense official has urged for integration. He said the EU could do much more with less if it integrated militarily and reduced inefficiencies and redundancies. That is something that would have far less expense and make the EU much more capable. The drawback is Germany will likely not support this, and the UK and France are reluctant to shoulder the majority of the burden, and in their defense rightfully so. 

&gt;Then reduce your defense spending? We should increase.

The US defense budget has been substantially reduced over the past few years, and the US was withdrawing significant amounts of troops and resources from Europe before the Russian crisis. Even while this was happening most NATO members continued making cuts. I definitely do not think one guarantees the other. 

&gt;Thing is, I don't think the military industrial complex in the United States is unhappy with this state affairs at all. It's a bonanza.

Defense contractors obviously love spending, but most dont realize the EEA exports more weapons than the US. There are many European countries, including France, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, and others where weapons manufacturing makes up a larger percentage of GDP than it does in the US. European nations rely on weapons production as a source of income just as the US does, and their companies like it equally as much. To put it in perspective, as a percentage of GDP the Netherlands exports more weapons than the US. Granted this does not take into account the internal contracts from the US government, but it certainly shows the definition of a military industrial complex either is overblown or needs to encompass far more than the US. 

&gt;I think it means that if we want to spend even more, we should probably finance it from corporate tax. But what would that mean for the health of the economy? Greece is doing great in terms of % of GDP. They're 6th. Are they not doing more harm than good with that right now? What good is a large % of GDP if you harm you economic stability and financial reserves in the process?

I completely agree and see your point. That is exactly why I think membership and contribution should be discussed on a country by country basis. As long as their is a plan of some kind I would feel better. And as you have pointed out, the NL carries a disproportionately high burden in the EU, which is exactly why the current system is flawed. It is hard to argue the NL should increase its spending when Dutch leaders can point to many other NATO members who are doing far worse. 

&gt;you need us, or you will perish

That is exactly the opposite of what I am saying. My whole point is the EU does not need the US there and it is a waste of money for US taxpayers. The only thing stopping the EU from being capable enough not to depend so heavily on the US is political will. The technology is there, the production capability is there, the human capital is there, and the wealth is there. So I am sorry if that is how I came off. My point was exactly the opposite is true, except for possibly in the short run. Poland and the Baltics seemed to put more pressure on Washington than Brussels for support which I thought was absolutely ridiculous. With the Polish PM saying he ""expects"" greater US involvement. 

All and all, I support either stronger European militaries or a unified EU military. But given the status quo where there is actually an incentive to decrease spending for many non-performing members (as is the case of the NL), because others are doing worse, I think the whole membership framework of NATO needs to be reevaluated. Because as I said, I believe the exact opposite of ""you need us, or you will perish"" in the long run at least.

First China entered WTO on unfair terms, that made them kill all Spain's labor intensive factories like textile and shoes,  and then the Euro + difference in inflation, wage increases and productivity made Germany take over all the rest of Spain's foreign and domestic markets.

Spain is a flyweight insisting on competing in the heavy weight league. They have lost so far. They are losing now, and they will be losing in the future.

They have tourism, and they sell fruit. All the rest of the jobs are in bureaucracy. ",0,1415489960,null,0,1415490218,0,clx036a,t3_2lo0ba,t1_clx036a,t1_clwwktb,null,1426121747,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

false,metroxed,EUSK,Basque Country,"&gt; the Catalan independence movements have been mostly fuelled by the economic crisis, not repressions, corruption, culture etc.

Indeed support for Catalan independence has skyrocketed in the last five years as a side effect of the economic and social woes Spain as a country is facing. This does not mean, however, that support for said cause is something new, atypical or that has just happened now for these reasons. There's been popular support for extended Catalan autonomy for decades now, going back to the Second Spanish Republic and even earlier than that. 

Economy seems to be an important factor. The majority of Catalans recently wanted financial autonomy, with devolved powers in what refers to taxing, just like the Basque Country has. They feel their tax money is spent elsewhere and that they are suffering a lack of inversions and economical problems because their money is going somewhere else other than Catalonia. They wanted to control their own taxes, but they were denied. Slowly, those who just wanted autonomy transformed into independence supporters, possibly fuelled by the economic crisis. 

But let's not undervalue the importance their culture and language have here. There's always been, even before the crisis, people who identified as Catalans before than Spaniards (if at all), that's why Catalan nationalist parties like CiU and recently ERC have been in power.

China had been vying for leadership of the Communist World ever since the Communist Rebels came out on top in 1949. And China is a *much* bigger player now that it was during any part of the Cold War. 

The existence of pauses during the Cold War is not unheard of either. Lots of people argue that the Cold War started in 1917, during the Russian Communist Revolutions (in which the USA and European powers sent small numbers of troops in to support the Czar and try to quell the communists) but had a pause during WWII to combat the somewhat existential threat of Hitler. Or you could even talk about the period of Détente which happened after the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) and lasted until 1980, when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan and Reagan hugely overreacted. 

But tangents aside, China's certainly been behaving in a very Cold War fashion with it's manoeuvrings over tiny islands. Let's not forget that last year there the USA airforce scrambled planes to fly over the islands and reinforce Japan's claim, due to the Chinese doing exactly the same in previous days to support their own claim. Very Cold War, eh? The only difference, is that the Russians and the Chinese appear to be ""fighting"" in two different theatres. But that's all they are, theatres where actions can be staged. In reality, the two are working closely. They're in competition with each other, yes, but they are certainly using each other as leverage against their adversaries. That deal the two powers made around the time EU sanctions on Russian oil came in (where they agreed to build a huge new pipeline, and agree on a price per cubic metre of oil) comes to mind.

You think I don't know about the decisions of souvereign countries in Eastern Europe that Russia doesn't have shit to do with? What part of ""Russia invaded another country and annexed their territory"" are you unclear on?

It's really embarassing to read that kind of crap in /r/germany of all places. Do you even know why the German national holiday used to be June 17th? If the Russians want to go back to turning all of Eastern Europe into their satellite states, they can't really hope for my understanding, and anyone who wants me to see the Russian view, where the Russian actions are justified because the evil Western nations mess around in their sphere of influence, can take his imperialist worldview back to the 19th century where it belongs.",0,1415496711,null,0,1415497495,0,clx33y6,t3_2loa68,t1_clx33y6,t1_clx2lx9,null,1426120322,7,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,7

I must say standing on the side of the European enlightenment and our centuries' long struggle to free ourselves from the bonds of religion will not, and I repeat, will *not* succumb to misunderstood appeasement of a new religion.

Muslims aren't a special breed of people that we cannot talk to and with like we would anyone else. They aren't retards. They're people just like you and I; people that we can demand things from and that we can choose to cooperate with or shun. Most leftists in Europe treat Muslims like children; no wonder we see all this petulant behavior from that group, then.

If ME/NA culture has taught me anything it's that you gain respect for standing your ground and holding your ideals high (you know, freedom of speech, equality between sexes, freedom to have a different sexuality etc.) high. Us giving in to religious demands certainly won't do anything but let religious people know they have a course of action.

I will *not* budge an inch for religion - especially not for one that seems to feed a culture of violence against non-members. Ever. And I'm not 'islamophobic' - I'm concerned with good reason about the growing presence of religious dogmas, courts, restrictions on life and thought and, especially, with religiously motivated violence against other minorities.

Don't say this. You don't speak for me or anyone else I know so don't you dare pretend that you do. 

Even if you did decide that you knew my own opinion better than myself (I trust I count as part of 'the public'?) you're not even correct. Throughout this year the polling has suggested that people want to stay in the EU - [21 of the 35 polls (that's a majority) taken this year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_referendum_on_United_Kingdom_membership_of_the_European_Union#Standard_polling_on_EU_membership) have shown higher support for staying in the EU compared to only 1 such poll last year and none in all the previous years. This suggests that support for the EU has increased quite dramatically this year probably in opposition to UKIP. The 'Don't Know' proportion has stayed the same meaning there is a few percent of the population who must have abandoned Eurosceptic views in only the last 9 months. Either way there has been a clear shift in favour. 

[On top of that the majority of young people want to stay.](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2013/02/14/uk-euroscepticism/) Only 20% of young people are Eurosceptic and the majority want to remain in. In other words the main support for leaving the EU comes among the people most likely to be gone in 10 years and the people who will have to live with the decision (whatever decision is made) for the longest time are the most in favour of the EU. 

In 10 years any idea of there being a Eurosceptic majority in the UK will be laughable. In fact even by 2017 things might be different with the very oldest and most Eurosceptic dying off and more young people able to vote.

A federation (which would inherently involve fiscal transfers to poorer states as it does in the US) is rejected by between 50 and 60% of the German population who are unhappy understandably that they have already been involved in bailing out some Eurozone countries. There seems to be support for kicking some members out of the Eurozone that are not economically similar to Germany and no support for German taxpayers being the backstop for the financial health of Southern European counties. You can't have a federal Europe without that.

The strange behavior towards anything that is considered rightist or anti-feminist. I personally don't like Nazis or chauvinists or racism. But it has kind of gotten out of hand.

If somebody speaks out against admitting an unlimited amount of  immigrants, because it would eventually lead to a collapse of every social system (and if you accept everyone with no regards of how many jobs there are, just because they don't want to live in their country (not speaking about refugees here!)), you get the whole righteousness of the leftists. It goes as far as condemning pupils that share a funny meme about Hitler as Nazis. (And I personally think ridiculing and confronting and/or talking to people who are on the far right spectrum than branding them as bad, fucked up persons.) 
It's somewhat funny to watch the outrage when violent protesters of the left spectrum (Rote Flora protests anyone?) are met with violence by the police. If NPD guys become violent and the police beats them up, it's kind of okay.
I don't like the NPD or Die Rechte. But if you are violent, neither the media nor the police should restrain themselves just because you are more acceptable for the society...
What people don't seem to get here is that being more right than the CDU doesn't automatically mean you are a Nazi and against democracy. The rightist spectrum was usually a term for a more conservative stand, not for racism.
 
Same goes for feminism. While I am absolutely pro equality, I am against a quota for women in higher positions and especially against the preference of women in hiring if they have the same qualifications as men, just because they are women. That's not equality, that's just trying to get rid of one discrimination to trade it for another. But just by saying that, I'm marked in the minds of not a small amount of people as misogynist. 

Germany likes to claim being a democratic, liberal and general open minded country. But as soon someone mentions even a slightly more right position than the center he/she is automatically a bad person, Nazi, misogynist etc. 

A strong democracy should be able to accept the freedom of speech and opinion, no matter how fucked that opinion/speech is.

* The first round of the presidential elections [was held a week ago](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/03/us-romania-election-idUSKBN0IL3BN20141103). Social-democrat PM Victor Ponta came out ahead, with 40%, and center-right Sibiu mayor and ethnic German, Klaus Iohannis came out second, with 30%.

* There were major problems with voting abroad, in the sense that voters needed to fill out some forms that slowed down the voting process, and at 21:00 pm, when voting ended, a lot of people were didn't get to vote after queueing for many many hours. In some places, [people revolted](http://www.euronews.com/2014/11/03/thousands-of-expats-unable-to-vote-in-romania-presidential-elections/) because of this, and police had to be called in. Many have accused the Government of intentionally slowing down voting abroad, as the expats tend to vote center-right (Ponta won only 15% of the expat vote).

* [Protests were organized yesterday](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/11/08/uk-romania-election-protests-idUKKBN0IS0QM20141108) in solidarity with the expats, especially in big student cities (Bucharest, Cluj, Timișoara, Iași, Oradea). Photo and videos [here](http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Special/COTROCENI+2014/Mitinguri+de+solidaritate+cu+diaspora+la+Bucuresti+Cluj+Timisoar).

* There's been a lot of talk about how the votes were distributed regionally ([Transylvania and Banat tended to vote Iohannis, the Old Kingdom, Ponta](http://i.imgur.com/hEtBokN.png)). Extra: [a somewhat more detailed map](http://media.hotnews.ro/media_server1/image-2014-11-7-18489257-41-rezultatele-prezidentiale-fiecare-localitate-din-romania.jpg).

* There's also been a lot of talk about electoral tourism. A lot of people voted on special list (your name gets put on a list if you vote elsewhere than your designated polling station). While percent of ""special list voting"" is normal in places with lots of students and tourists, some of the counties that saw high special list voting ([the ones in the south-south-west](http://i2.wp.com/www.petreanu.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/harta-turism-electoral.jpg)) have neither, and tend to be pro-Ponta fiefs.

It's kinda like putting octagon wheels on a car. Sure, we can put a better engine in the car to make up for the power loss, and with enough research we could build an advanced suspension that makes the ride as smooth as one with regular wheels. But that doesn't matter, because whatever engine or suspention we build, a car with round wheels will always make better use of the technology, and will always be more efficient than the one with octagon wheels.

Hagen von Tronje, Held in der Nibelungensage, ist der Namenpatron unseres Whiskys Tronje von Hagen. Unter diesem Namen finden sich auch der New Make und unser Whiskylikör wieder.
 
Unser zweites Faß lagert in der Dechenhöhle bei konstanten 10 ° und 100 % Luftfeuchte. Die Flaschen aus dem Faß können schon jetzt als Frühzeichnung bestellt werden. Alternativ können Sie einfach unter Bestellung die Resrvierung online auslösen.
 
Das Faß wird im Juli 2014 aus der Höhle geholt und im August abgefüllt.
 
Aktuell verkaufen wir einen Single Malt New Make. So wird das Destillat genannt, bis es alt genug ist, um Whisky heißen zu dürfen. Den New Make bieten wir entweder in der klaren Variante an (Dieser New Make hat das Faß nie gesehen.) oder als kurz im Faß gereiften New Make.
 
Jim Murray hat uns nicht nur geholfen das erste Faß zu befüllen, sondern auch unseren New Make getestet und in der Whsikybibel aufgenommen.
 
Wir freuen sich über hervorragende 86 aus 100 Punkten. Gemeinsam mit einem Hinweis auf die beeindruckende Qualität des nun schon einige Monate fassgelagerten Destillats und der Erklärung, dass er es kaum erwarten könne, dieses in reichlich 2 Jahren als Whisky bewerten zu dürfen.
 
Er beschreit darin den Geschmack des New Makes als zitrustönig, attraktiv ölig, saftig, malzig und „schmatzend lecker“. Zusätzlich weist er darauf hin, dass Abfüllungen mit einer solch hohen Punktzahl in seine persönliche Kategorie „sehr gut bis exzellent; es lohnt sich auf jeden Fall, diese Whiskys zu kaufen“ fällt.",0,1415528832,null,0,1415529961,0,clxd4pi,t3_2lqt5t,t1_clxd4pi,t3_2lqt5t,null,1426114694,10,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,10

È che trovo la TV fastidiosa come mezzo di comunicazione, in quanto mezzo di comunicazione unidirezionale e quindi monco, in particolare per quei programmi che dovrebbero fare informazione, divulgazione e approfondimento.
La TV posso solo guardarla e subirla (o al limite spegnerla), non posso parteciparla. Se sento un politico o un conduttore o chicchessia, affermare una castroneria, posso solo subirlo passivamente (senza contare che in TV, nei dibattiti, ha ragione chi urla più forte). Si, giusto, c'è il telecomando e infatti tutto ciò mi infastidisce al punto che non guardo nemmeno più quelle trasmissioni di approfondimento/informazione, che sono disponibili anche in streaming, perché comunque, anche avendo fatto lo sforzo di cambiare mezzo, il paradigma di tali trasmissioni è rimasto invariato.
A tutto questo aggiungici la qualità di trasmissioni come questo ""Tale e quale Show"". Ok, è vero non l'ho visto, né lo vedrò e quindi sto giudicando sulla base di miei pregiudizi, fondati su uno spezzone di qualche minuto. Però ho la netta sensazione di non essere eccessivamente nel torto a giudicarlo un programma veramente di bassa qualità.
Oltre questo c'è anche una questione più caratteriale mia: non riesco a stare più di 20 minuti (la durata media di un episodio dei Simpson o di Samurai Jack... che ho appena finito di guardare e sono già in crisi di astinenza) seduto senza far niente. Perché comunque il tempo che passo a guardare qualcosa passivamente, lo percepisco ormai come tempo perso, se supera i 20 minuti.
Fa eccezione il cinema, anche se non ti nascondo che se venissero introdotte delle pause di 10 minuti ogni 30-40 minuti di film, ne sarei ben contento.
E beh... fanno abbastanza eccezione anche i documentari del canale Big Think su youtube e cose simili. Abbastanza perché comunque finisco sempre per guardarli in 2-3 parti da 30-40 minuti l'una.",0,1415529130,null,0,false,0,clxd6en,t3_2lnwl4,t1_clxd6en,t1_clwtbh9,null,1426114672,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

Per quanto ne so, sono di privati, e soprattutto nel caso della prima ci sono stati negli anni diversi tentativi di speculazione finanziaria (per capirci, compro il rudere per quattro soldi, mi pappo i finanziamenti per le ristrutturazioni, non faccio un cazzo, nessuno controlla, poi dopo 30 anni vallo a pescare il responsabile). Lo stato di degrado della villa d'Elboeuf è diventato un problema ""pubblico"" dopo che il crollo di una delle pareti ha interessato la ferrovia che collega Portici a Napoli (si, QUELLA Portici-Napoli). Quel treno io l'ho usato a lungo per andare all'università e poi al lavoro, e la linea è stata interrotta per anni perchè non si riesce a capire chi deve pagare per la messa in sicurezza.

Le due ville sono ancora nello stato mostrato nel video. La critica della donna intervistata secondo me è pertinente: non mi riesce difficile immaginare che l'ente ville vesuviane sia un piccolo serbatoio di posti di lavoro. Bisogna anche fare un'altra osservazione però: sotto la responsabilità dell'ente ricadono tutte le ville, e dire che non è stato fatto niente è un po' riduttivo. Ad Ercolano per esempio c'è la villa Campolieto, che non è messa male. la villa Favorita, rimessa a nuovo e sede di un bel parco dove ogni anno vengono organizzati eventi e concerti (l'estate scorsa ci è venuto [ELIO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGEJKJcE9sw), tra gli altri). C'è anche la villa Signorini, molto bella. Nella villa Aprile, ad Ercolano, oggi c'è un albergo a 4 stelle; quando ero alle medie (più di 20 ani fa quindi) ci abitava un mio compagno di classe, e la villa versava veramente in condizioni pietose (tipo quelle dell'Albergo dei poveri all'inizio del video): ci vivevano famiglie poco abbienti, la struttura era fatiscente, non era raro incontrare diversi personaggi molto singolari al suo interno. Volendo concludere: qualcosa si muove, qualcosina, ma troppo lentamente, ed è facile immaginare che questo possa accadere perchè i soldi vengono gestiti (più o meno intenzionalmente?) una mezza chiavica. Le ville sono poco ""promosse"" e potrebbero essere sfruttate meglio.

No, Alba/Albu/Alpi (there were many spelling variants) was the Archaic Irish for Britain as a whole, cognate with *Albion*. The whiteness is sometimes attributed to the chalk cliffs of Dover.

I have been in your exact same situation. I arrived to Turin 15 years ago to study, and I spoke only the necessary Italiant to get me through the day. My main advice to you is try not to isolate yourself. I know how your instict tells you ""stick with the other Pakistani students"" but it's gonna complicate things for you.  I ve met Asian stuents who spent more than a year in Italy and couldnt put together a single phrase because their courses were in english and outside of them they would only stick with erasmus students. So, your best bet is to try and talk to italians, read the newspapers, watch italian tv etc. This will help you broaden your vocabulary but also give you hints about the correct accent. The difference between ""anno"" (year) and ""ano"" (anus) is soooo small !
I dont have lots of advice about part time jobs cause the market seems to be very saturated and even bars dont seem to hire part timers a lot any more. And if they do it's probably some hot chick or something.
Last but not least, Turin is in a perfect position for tourists. You can reach very easily Milan, Bologna, Florence and now, with the quick trains, Rome.

Wrong. He doesn't have any kind of knowledge on economics or government. He supported his views on deregulating public healthcare by claiming that ""veterinatians are more privatised and able to function"". He has been losing elections for almost twenty years, and is in politics mostly thanks to pretentious middle-schoolers who grow up but don't mature. You can't separate the 1880s laissez-faire economic attitude from 1880s views on women and society.

I do agree with you in the latter example, if I understand you correctly. Korwin isn't some kind of aberration, he's a natural extension of the post-communist policies. Most Poles would likely claim ""private is better than public"" (healthcare, insurance, etc.), Korwin just logically follows. In many ways that makes him worse than the nazis, because he's actually a part of the establishment, whenever the current right-wing government introduces a new ""free market"" initiative, Korwin gains worshippers.

A lot of kids are drawn to Korwin (and Ruch Narodowy) partly because they get distaste for what they understand as ""political correctness"" from their homes. The left and democracy can't offer them alternative. The ""Polish culture"", Polish tradition has been long stolen by the right, especially by the Church; for a long time the socialists have been promoting multi-culturalism, disdain for Polish tradition and history.

&gt;By Guy Sorman

Western values: some revel in them, some extol them, some curse them, and some juxtapose them with Asian values, but they are not always precisely specified. The consensus on these values ​​will be more conclusive if the definition of our values is open to interpretation. It was the FAES Foundation for Analysis and Social Studies, a  Spanish think-tank chaired by José Maria Aznar, who met for their annual congress in Guadarrama, on July 5th. There they challenged me to give background content to the famous and elusive values. After having tortured minds for weeks, I managed not to a final result to a hypothesis: it seems to me, in comparison with the worldviews found in other great civilizations, ours is distinguished by a unique character seldom found elsewhere: the ability of criticism and self-criticism.

Critical thinking, it seems to me, explains how the West has become the historic home of innovation and progress. As explained by the British philosopher Karl Popper , science progresses in the West primarily because any scientific hypothesis is immediately subjected to a critical fire that will strengthen or replace it with a more persuasive hypothesis. In contrast, in the Islamic or Confucian worlds everything is asked or forced to comply with a perfect assumed initial model, (the Koran for Muslims or proto-history for Confucians). In both cases, the golden age is in the past while in the West the golden age belongs to the future. These are broad concepts, do not bother with historical details and exceptions: they are, it seems to me, well evidenced trends.

Assuming this singularity as Western roughly based, we can trace the origins in two emblematic sources: the Bible and Greek tragedy. In the book of Job, the reader witnesses a controversy (inconceivable in any other revealed religion) between Job, mere mortal and his God. Because God inflicts punishment upon him that he judges to be illogical, Job protests and criticizes God. God concedes and restores the good fortune of Job but arguing that, since he was God, his actions do not have to be justified. Job replied, ""I submit,"" but in doing so he still have the last word; remember that God, after this final critical exchange, then does not reappear again in any the following books of the Bible, he instead from there on out never speaks to man directly. Joining the Jewish and Christian theology, therefore leads to challenging every idea. Even those which (a priori) is revealed from on high. If Jerusalem is the primary source of Western values, Athens is the second or concurrently. It is recalled here for the sake of simplicity, that the dispute between Antigone and Creon, his sovereign. Antigone (this is the funeral of his brother) is opposed to the monarchical authority in the name of higher laws which they believe would be needed to supersede the king, thus the Kings political authority therefore can not be absolute, ever. The argument makes Antigone the ancestor of all democracy activists and human rights.

Job and Antigone laid the foundations for Western thought but at the same time, do not they lay these foundations in messy way? Criticism of the authority of God and of the King, would make the West waver between anarchy and despotism for many ages. The balance will be found during the Enlightenment via the introduction of the rule of law, a kind of synthesis between the social order and the critical vitality. The rise of the West occurred first theologically, philosophically and politically; then leading to a exceptionality of economics, of scientific progress, and of technical development. The rise of this exceptionality was often chaotic, but yet was uninterrupted.

One might sing to me about the ""decline of the West"" - a song as old as the West itself - and the rise of Asian values, who require despotism to promote an enduring societal continuity. But the Wests own historical pessimism (a form of self-criticism) is contradicted by the facts: if we accept that the future belongs to the innovative, it appears that today, two-thirds of the patents filed in the world, a photograph of the economy ahead, are of Western origin, the United States and European Union. If we add Japan, partially agreed with the Western values ​​and even South Korea, 80% of patents are of Western origin, the balance back to China and India.

Finally, what we have defined as Western, values that while ​​born in the West are all essentially universal. For example, significant, Liu Xiaobo, the Democratic and jailed leader of China, asserts and appropriates the philosophy of the Western Enlightenment: he considers it universal while yet remaining completely Chinese. If Liu Xiaobo, from prison just said, we should speak of Western values ​​but consider that critical thinking is universal, but more or less repressed. Wherever political or religious or ethnic oppression back, it is found that the critical spirit prevails and that the progress of societies results: the Westerners are somehow released the first, it is their responsibility to remain free, critical and self-critical, true to themselves, and also to support all those who adhere to this same desire for freedom.",0,1415531908,null,0,1415558874,0,clxdmj8,t3_2lr671,t1_clxdmj8,t3_2lr671,null,1426114463,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

&gt; In the city of Donetsk and in Makeevka (25km north-east of Donetsk city), in “DPR”-controlled territory, the SMM observed convoys of heavy weapons and tanks. At the time of reporting, the SMM could hear heavy, outgoing shelling to the north and northwest of the city’s outskirts, which had started at 14:45hrs.
&gt; 
&gt; At 13:55hrs, on the eastern outskirts of Makeevka (25km north-east of Donetsk), within territory under control of the “Donetsk People’s Republic” (“DPR”), the SMM observed a convoy of more than 40 trucks and tankers moving west on highway H-21.
&gt; 
&gt; Of these 19 were large trucks – Kamaz type, covered, and without markings or number plates – each towing a 122mm howitzer and containing personnel in dark green uniforms without insignia. Fifteen were Kraz troop carriers. The SMM was on the move and could therefore not ascertain the contents of these. The remaining six were small fuel tankers, fitted with cranes. The SMM observed an unmarked BTR armoured personnel carrier leading the convoy, with a tarpaulin over the gun.
&gt; 
&gt; At 15:20hrs, at the intersection of Leninskyi Street and Kuprin Street (7km south-west of Donetsk city centre) the SMM observed a convoy of nine tanks – four T72 and five T64 – moving west, also unmarked.

Instead of down-voting because you're upset at my comments, why don't you point out exactly where in that report the OSCE mentions:

* A Russian convoy
* That the vehicles entered Ukraine

Historically spoken, central Europe (mainly France and Germany) had for centuries much less contact and exchange with the Osman Empire compared to e.g. Russia. Because of that, Turkey remains a rather unknown country to many Europeans in terms of politics, diplomatics and still economics.

edit:Found a good sumary of why some people might not see Turkey as being culturally European:

Turkey’s historic and cultural roots lay in Central Asia and the Middle East. It missed the shared experiences that bind Europeans together, from the cultural legacy of Renaissance and Enlightenment, to the horrors of the Second World War II which galvanized the drive for united Europe. As an overwhelmingly Muslim nation, Turkey’s cultural traditions are fundamentally different from that of Christian Europe.

The people who fought for their independence against the Ottomans ; the Greeks, Serbs (etc..) were emboldened by Enlightenment principles of national sovereignty.

As to why I think the fairest option is to have the Catalan population as the sovereign group in this case, it is a point I address in my second paragraph of my latter comment. In our current society, we (theoretically, at least) use democracy in order to decide the course of the whole group (Spain in this case); this is a way of determining what does it mean to be a part of the group, which rights are guaranteed and which duties are assumed as long as one stays in it. The decision by a subgroup of leaving the bigger group, however, should always (as I see it) be unrestricted by the second one's rules, as it's in essence relinquishing all of its rights and duties altogether.

Allow a referendum in the worst moment of the last 40 years in Spain would be a suicide, losing Catalonia (and Basque Country next) in the current economical situation is a disaster. If PP allow that would be his end as political party.

Nothing is going to happen in Catalonia, nationalist aren't going to declare unilateral independence.

But seriously now, looking at the comments in here there are all sorts of contradictions and each one is pretty arbitrary. I'll try to pre-empt the usual arguments:

* Geography. Well then this excludes half of Iceland, parts of Spain and Portugal, Greenland, Cyprus, Russia, Armenia, Georgia, maybe Malta, and all overseas territories.

* European ideals such as democracy and equality. Democracy was invented 2500 years ago and it got quickly forgotten until very, very recently. Also, Turkey became a democracy way earlier than a lot of ""European-proper"" countries. Equality is pretty recent too, let's not forget that Jews fled to the Ottoman empire en masse because they were treated like subhumans pretty much everywhere else, with few exceptions.

* Renaissance and the Enlightenment. A big chunk of the EU would have to get kicked out if we go by this, including Greece, which invented the damn word and the ideals mentioned above.

* Historical ties. This isn't a very well thought out argument. Turkish history is tied to European history.

* Christianity. Bosnia and Albania are out then, not to mention some significant native minorities in other countries. Also, I don't think the Czech Republic counts as christian anymore.

Nice conspiracy theory you have there.

&gt;Now, the rebellion only holds by constantly shifting in new Russian soldiers and materials,

And where is the proof to such claim?

&gt;And hasn't been very effective at that as there is so little public support in Ukraine.

It is supported by historical Russian regions like Kharkov, Donbass or Odessa. It's just people are scared, because there are constant abductions of the pro-Russians some of which are even were filmed (see Lyashko, for example).

&gt;So Russia keeps performing it's operations under cover of darkness, lies and deciet.

Again conspiracy theories.

That site has been [debunked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FqdgQ7t51M&amp;list=UULX-a4XtNcbGbTXVO31oIBw) by Shariy and other journalists [multiple times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DTX3b3qWzw). Basically those are just anti-government Russians and Ukrainian internet activists faking those lists, taking names from University and juvenile football teams and other lists.

&gt;As more and more Russian soldiers disappear in a ditch or under the ground in Ukraine.

Volunteer participation of Russian (and other nationalities) is undeniable fact. Some of them are ex-military. But this is pretty obvious and has nothing to do with our government. If Texas becomes independent and later on there would be Civil War between Hispanics and Yankees there, then it would be expected for volunteers to concur from both US and Latin America to aid different sides.

false,cyborg_selkie,EART,"US citizen, lives in Romania, married into Englishness","People keep bringing up the Enlightenment as a historic reason why Turkey is arguably not ""European"". I think you'd also have to consider the Ottoman Empire's history of conquest in Europe. During this time, the Ottomans were considered the opposite of European civilization: Europe was western and Christian, the Ottomans were Eastern and Muslim. Considering that the average person's understanding of the world in the ~14th century was severely limited compared to today due to a lack of things like cars, planes, or internet, at the time the Ottomans would be the most foreign thing the average joe could think of.

I don't want to dismiss the people who have actual legit reasons for thinking Turkey is not Europe, but I think many people hold this view because it is a legacy of European bias that can be traced back for quite some time. 

I think a lot of it has to do with Islam as well. While secularism could be considered a European value, there are many countries in the EU that are religious enough for religion to occasionally encroach on lawmaking (Ireland, Poland, Romania...) so I highly doubt that lack of secularism alone is the problem. I think it's the (recent) compromised secularism in Turkey *and* the fact that most Turks are Muslim that really does them in. I think if Turkey had a large Muslim population but was a staunchly secular state, people would consider Turkey to be more European, despite the fact that Christian countries that aren't 100% secular get a pass. 

Lastly, I think Erdogan really fucked things up for you guys. It seems like he's been joining the train of thought of countries like Russia and China who are strong independent states who don't need no liberal values (democracy, equal treatment for minorities, rule of law, etc). Even though he is corrupt, a large number of Turks have certainly voted for him multiple times, which signals that a larger portion of the population are cool with these anti-European values. This turn really *does* separate Turkey from being culturally European. EU countries are supposed to aim for these standards and the recent facist-y turn in Hungary is kind of flipping everyone out.

- Gov company never will be as effective as private one

* In 2009 Czech Republic did the EU presidency. It was taken as opportunity to waste a lot of money. One case got before the court now - 12 people are accused of massive fraud, 400 million CZK (~15 million euro). The minister who had political responsibility and signed the fraudulent deal was, however, neither investigated nor accused, only the lower level ministry staff were.

The responsible authorities promise they will be more careful in the future while spending public money. [Cz](http://www.novinky.cz/ekonomika/352349-nku-modernizace-vodnich-cest-se-prodrazuje.html).

* Few years ago the state allowed to keep part of its strategic reserves (like oil) abroad. (*This must be something unique in the whole world.*)  One company kept about 2,7% of total diesel oil reserves in Germany. A control in the field found that 5,5 million litres of the oil is missing.  The company is in deep debt and already fired all employees. Its ownership structure was unclear from the very beginning. The authorities now try to salvage whatever oil was left.

* A journalist tried to obtain from authorities list of foreigners who were granted Czech citizenship based on some exception.

It was based on accusation of sexual assault by the father. (Mother of the kids claims one kid needed a special diet, kindergarten staff didn't care, she complained repeatedly and the staff decided to retaliate.) The accusation proved false but the Norwegian authorities kept the kids in foster care anyway. The mother was allowed to see them only twice a year, for 2 hours, and was not allowed to show any emotions or to talk in Czech to them.  Czech Republic has a minister for human rights, ombudsman and multitude of other institutions supposed to help people in distress. At the best they told the mother they cannot do anything. She tries to medialize the case a this angered Norwegian authorities which decided to strip her of parentship and put the kids for adoption.

You should remember that ten years ago when they were writing the EU constitution the mediterranean countries wanted to include Christian God as one criteria of the Union and the Northern European countries opposed to it seeing as this wasn't part of the EU-identity. We have since passed laws together that state and institutions it fund should be secular by nature. 

It's better to talk of European values or European viewpoints. 

And when is a country ready to join EU? When they have fair elections, working democracy and a society that cares for everybody (and where everybody cares of society). Where the state plays no favourites by race or religion.

If Turkey can stick to that, there's no reason they couldn't join.

I assume that you mean 'separated from', and it's simple. Either you're a Randroid or a democrat. Either you're for the laissez-faire free market, or against, say opression of women. Because, hey, in a free market the employer doesn't have to hire a young woman who will soon become pregnant, it's his company, and the girl can work on the open market, right? Anyone else could hire her, but not me. No one should be surprised by Korwin's social views, but young people, even women, try to defend him.

false,Titanomakhia,ENGL,England,"And on only the 14th October Ipsos MORI showed 56% in favour of staying and 36% against staying - there's fluctuation and anomalies on both sides. Survation tends to poll UKIP support highly too so the recent poll is understandable and Ipsos MORI tends the opposite way consistently showing wins for the ""Stay"" side. YouGov are fairly reliable - they were the closed to the actual EU election result than anyone else. 

There have been periods of support for leaving and staying throughout the year normally in response to whatever news stories come up that week. I'm assuming this current dip in support is because of the re-jigging of our contributions to the EU and the increase of £1.7 billion. It may recover it, it may not -  the record this year seems to suggest that it will recover like it did in May and at the beginning and end of June plus it seems to be tending back up anyway; support for staying increased 3% in the week from the 28th October to 3rd November towards where it had been before that week. 

Either way, all the polling has sample sizes of 2000 or less which is not fantastic when you're trying to estimate the opinions of 63 million. The only ones that have sample sizes higher than about 2000 are the YouGov poll on the 10th of March with about 3000 which showed more support for staying and Lord Ashcroft's poll in January with 20,000 people which found support evenly split - and that was before the gains we seem to have seen from March onwards so the balance may have shifted in favour of staying since then. it will be interesting to see if they do a large poll again next year. It certainly doesn't show significant support but it shows the public is at the very least split. It cannot be fair to say that 'the public want to leave' by any stretch of the imagination. You would be ignoring the opinions of ~40% of the public even at the most pessimistic estimation.

false,TuEsiAs,null,null,"[Orientalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism_%28book%29) (1978), by Edward Said, is a foundational text for the academic field of Post-colonial Studies. Orientalism proved to be an intellectual document central to the field of post-colonial studies, its thesis being considered as historically factual, true, and accurate for the pertinent periods studied, and especially regarding the cultural representations of ""Orientals"" and ""The Orient"" presented in the mass communications media of the West. 

Have you actually read the book, that you disagree with? Author of this article does not in any way accuse all western Europeans of being Orientalists and racists. He accuses pro-Russian commentators in many Western countries who fell into the trap of Orientalism, when defending Russian actions in Ukraine.  (but also in Georgia, Moldova, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia)

*When a commentator claims that Russia feels threatened by the advance of NATO in Eastern Europe or Ukraine’s approach to the EU, he’s basically implying that Russia does indeed have an inalienable right to claim rights in the region, as if Eastern Europe was nothing but a tool to compensate Russia’s unresolved inferiority complexes. Pro-Russian commentators implicitly deny Ukraine the very dignity of active subject in the whole issue, thus even denying its relevance as an independent state.*

*The idea that Russian actions are legitimate reactions to the interference of “outsiders” in a region seen as “Russian” is nothing but a 2.0 expression of the same imperialist mentality with which Europeans empires split the Middle East. This is all the more surprising as it often comes from people who embrace ostensibly anti-imperialist positions in any other context. In their writings, Eastern Europe is a passive object on which Moscow is the only one actor (in the Latin sense of “doer”) entitled to operate, with no concern for smaller, local figures.*

*The practice of denying the dignity of active subjects of non-Russian peoples of Eastern Europe is a long story. We Western Europeans regularly accept the idea that this part of the World falls within Russia’s “sphere”or should just be Russian. This generates appalling ideas that Russia is right in interfering in Ukraine because it already “had to give up” the Baltic States in the past and “the West” really shouldn’t “deprive” it of other countries, or that Ukraine is too important for Russian national identity because of the Kyivan Rus, as if this was enough to ignore the desires of the millions of people who had (and have) to suffer to allow Russia to freely define its identity.*

*For far too many Western experts what really matters is the Russian feelings. Everything else, what Ukrainians, Poles, Moldovans, Balts, Georgians, Armenians may think, is much less significant, because it’s just the feeling of “others,” subaltern subjects, unworthy of the dignity of actors, at best reacting victims of an orientalist interpretation of history that Westerners apply far too often to their Eastern European neighbors.*


*The disproportionate attention for Russia’s feelings, the solidarity for the Russian “tragedy” of losing its empire and the insensitivity to other peoples’ priorities become possible only if one places the Russian nation in a hierarchically superior position, applying the orientalist misconception that only a former power can have the dignity of an actor. European colonialists saw the East as a mere object they could play with. Pro-Russian commentators see Eastern Europe in the same way: Russia can do as it pleases, for this is seen as part of the natural geopolitical order.*


*Pro-Russian commentators’ orientalist thinking emerges in the way they portray Ukraine as a country incapable of action on its own initiative. They invariably see Eastern European countries as objects manipulated by the West. This follows what was described above: if Russia is seen as the only state worth of the dignity of “actor” and Eastern Europe as a passive, hierarchically subordinated object, it’s then inevitable that any independent action by any Eastern European state must be the result of a Western interference.*


*Unsurprisingly, pro-Russian commentators almost never speak in terms of “access of Eastern Europe into NATO,” but of “NATO/EU expansion in Eastern Europe.” The “East” is seen as a land of conquest – by nature subordinated to Russia – in which “the West” engages in dangerous games against its “legitimate” owner. Local actors are insignificant: their role in the whole NATO/EU enlargement process is ignored. Former communist countries are seen as victims of an inclusion in Western security structures carried out against their will.*


*This is of course nonsense: the integration of Eastern Europe in Euro-Atlantic security structures happened in two directions, with a very intense activity from Eastern actors that Western actors have often found far too pressing. In pro-Russian analyses, though, nothing of this appears: Eastern European states are denied the dignity of actors in the process and the very idea that tens of millions of people in the region may have wanted at many points in history to change their alignment is ruled out completely.*",0,1415544941,null,0,false,0,clxgbsg,t3_2lqyv0,t1_clxgbsg,t1_clxfobl,null,1426113203,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

&gt; The demolition of the wall was started on November 9, 1989

Not really, no. The existing border crossing points opened unexpectedly late in the evening of November 9th, but the demolition of the Wall didn't get underway until June the following year. At first the border remained, but new crossing points were being opened.

&gt; The Berlin Wall was actually constructed to separate Soviet zone (East Germany or German Democratic Republic) from the Allies zone (West Germany or Federal Republic of Germany).

Wrong. Berlin was completely inside the Soviet zone, which by 1961 was the German Democratic Republic, and was itself divided into sectors. The Berlin Wall was constructed to separate the British, US and French sectors of Berlin from the Soviet sector of Berlin and from the GDR.

&gt; The construction of the wall was started in the night of 13th August when most of the Germans were sleeping.

During the night of 12th August 1961 and the early hours of the next morning, the (East German) army, border guards and police started blocking road and rail connections.

false,Maximovitch,null,null,"&gt;Les institutions de la Ve République sont tous les jours foulées au pied. De Gaulle n'a jamais conçu un instant la dérive présidentialiste dont elles font l'objet depuis le quinquennat, avec un président de la République élu en même temps que l'Assemblée nationale, chef d'une majorité et assurant lui-même la politique quotidienne dans le moindre détail. Lui ne cessait de répéter que le chef de l'Etat devait être en charge de l'essentiel, «guide de la nation», arbitre au dessus des partis, fixer un cap et s'en remettre au Premier ministre pour gouverner le pays au quotidien. Le retour de la toute puissance des partis politiques, à travers le système des «primaires» pour désigner un candidat à la présidence de la République, par exemple, lui eût probablement répugné. En tout cas le naufrage actuel de l'institution présidentielle marque le paroxysme d'un long processus de trahison de l'héritage gaullien.

Complètement faux. La Constitution du 4 octobre 1958 telle que conçue par De Gaulle et Debré consacre effectivement un Président-arbitre, au dessus des partis, dont les prérogatives lui permettent de concilier avec toutes les pouvoirs (nomination du Premier ministre, dissolution de l'Assemblée nationale, saisine du Conseil constitutionnel, séance parlementaire extraordinaire, référendums aux contours limités...). C'est un personnage distant élu au suffrage universel indirect par un corps de grands électeurs.

Néanmoins rapidement, et le style de l'exercice du pouvoir et surtout la décision soumise à référendum d'introduire l'élection au suffrage universel direct du Président de la République en 1962 bouleversent la donne et marquent le consécration d'un Président-capitaine. Cette lecture présidentialiste est confirmée par les Français qui élisent effectivement De Gaulle en 1965 au SU direct. D'ailleurs pour ces présidentielles, bien que réprouvant généralement les partis politiques, il lui a bien fallu recourir à une écurie présidentielle à travers l'UNR. C'est désormais le PR qui domine le régime, étant paré d'une légitimité démocratique et étant la pièce maitresse, ""la clef de voûte des institutions"", il tient dans ses mains un Premier ministre qui n'a plus tant à se soucier de sa légitimité auprès du Parlement. Pompidou refuse d'ailleurs en ~~1962~~ [edit: c'est en 1966 après l'élection au SU direct] de soumettre son investiture à une déclaration de politique générale de l'article 49.1 devant l'Assemblée nationale, après le conflit entre celle-ci et De Gaulle et sa dissolution consécutive. En 1962 le PR gagne la partie et impose sa domination sur les autres pouvoirs.

Pour répondre à la question, je dirais que l'on manque surtout de mythes mobilisateurs 44 ans après. De Gaulle, c'était l'incarnation d'un puissant mythe politique: l'homme providentiel. Toute sa carrière est contée encore aujourd'hui de la sorte. C'est très symptomatique des moments de crises, un tel attrait pour un héros, un saveur, et c'est même ancré dans notre histoire politique. Rien d'anodin à ce que la période soit propice à ce genre de réflexion sur ce que ferait De Gaulle aujourd'hui, à une nostalgie d'un âge d'or idéalisé du ""Général"". A ce titre, probablement que le constat que ""les Français sont des veaux"" est, lui aussi, toujours d'actualité.",0,1415547543,null,0,1415573977,0,clxh7l9,t3_2lreu0,t1_clxh7l9,t3_2lreu0,null,1426112791,11,false,france,t5_2qhjz,11

* The direction of travel is already set: from a small majority in favour of a devolved parliament in 1979, to a large one in 1997, to a close defeat for the independence proposition in 2014.

* Post-referendum polling suggests that enough NO voters have already changed their minds to return a different result, if a second referendum were to be held tomorrow ([here](http://scotgoespop.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/scotland-swings-behind-independence-by.html)).

* Polling for the Westminster and Holyrood parliaments are currently predicting huge swings to the pro-independence parties ([here](http://scotgoespop.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/political-earthquake-beckons-as-snp.html), [here](http://scotgoespop.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/huge-snp-lead-for-westminster-reported.html), [here](http://scotgoespop.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/a-third-full-scale-poll-shows-snp-with.html) and [here](http://scotgoespop.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/now-this-ones-beyond-belief-snp-lead-by.html)). Uniform swing predictors are currently predicting a wipeout for the Labour Party and Liberal Democrats in Scotland in next year's general election, with the SNP taking the lion's share of the seats, becoming the third largest UK parliamentary party and holding the balance of power in a hung parliament. [More reliable forecasts](http://www.ukelect.co.uk/HTML/forecasts.html) also show much the same thing. The prominent Labour Party politician Diane Abbott said on Thursday's *This Week* that Labour now faces an ""existential threat"" in Scotland. 

* Membership of each of the pro-independence parties - the SNP, the SSP and the Greens - has surged since the referendum campaign. Membership of the SNP has more than tripled and now stands at 84,228, making it the third largest party in the UK, by membership, (significantly larger than the Liberal Democrats, the traditional third party), even though it only has a pool of 5.3 million potential members to draw from versus the UK parties' 63 million. SNP members now outnumber Labour Party members in Scotland by a ratio of more than 6:1 ([here](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/revealed-just-how-many-members-does-labour-really-have-in-scotland.25814760)), a formidable basis upon which to build any future campaigns.

The situation in Ukraine undoubtedly has a geopolitical aspect, but if you reduce it to simply a great game between Russia and the West, apart from being ""racist"" in the sense that it ignores the people who are most affected by this conflict, actually undermines the West's position.

The imperialist viewpoint acknowledges not only that Ukraine, historically has been in the Russian ""sphere of influence"" (essentially a euphemism for 'informal empire'), but also assumes that Ukraine ought to be in somebody's sphere of influence. That it's essentially a pawn to be fought over by the great powers.

So a westerner with this mentality can take one of two positions. Either that ""we shouldn't meddle in Russia's backyard, because that's basically interfering with their property"". Or, more belligerently ""we should meddle, because fuck Russia, west is best!"" I think the first one is far more reasonable and that's where a lot of pro-Russian sympathy comes from.

It's only by insisting on the liberal principle that people do have the ability and the right to decide their own country's destiny that you can argue for a pro-Western and pro-Ukrainian position that has the moral high-ground over the Russians.

Ich bin mittlerweile auch irgendwie zu der Ansicht gelangt, dass in allen vom Menschen geschaffenen, nichttotalitären System eins doch immer und überall regiert: das Chaos.

Alle bisherigen Systeme waren so ineffizient und letztendlich doch chaotisch (der Kapitalismus ist vielleicht am effizientesten bisher - und Planwirtschaft mit dem eigentlichen Anspruch der Effizienz schaffte es im prädigitalen Zeitalter auch nicht mal ansatzweise den Kapitalismus zu schlagen), sodass Menschen es immer wieder schafften kollektiv zu versagen. Der Liberalismus mit dem Versprechen, dass das Leitprinzip der egoistischen Eigeninteressenverfolgung als Konstante im System eine Art ""Ordnung"" (siehe den modernen ""**Ordo**liberalismus"") bringe wurde bestenfalls nur zum Teil erfüllt. 

Tatsächlich führt der unglaubliche Mangel an Transparenz in unseren liberalen Systemen immer wieder zu Ineffizienz, Miskommunikation und deshalb zwangsläufig zu demokratischen Unfällen, was es letztendlich auch schafft wegen ebendieser mangelnden/magelhaften Interaktion (und gerne auch Diskussion) zwischen Volk und Staat und innerhalb des Staates das Vertrauen in die Regierung -und allgemein den Menschen, da das Menschenbild imho in Zusammenhang mit der Erwartungshaltung an die Regierung steht- nicht nur zu untergraben, sondern zu zerstören. Transparenz ist daher mho eine der letzten großen Hindernisse zur Erlangung der bestmöglichen Demokratieformen und bestmöglichen zwischenmenschlichen und systematischen Harmonie - so viele systematische Probleme könnten sich in Luft auflösen. Leider muss ich mir eingestehen, dass mit umfassender Transparenz vielleicht auch neue Probleme entstehen könnten. Man kann das ja schlecht beurteilen. Aber irgendwie sagt mir mein Gefühl, dass die gelösten Probleme die geschaffenen Probleme um Längen eindeutig überwiegen müssen.

Das stimmt nur zur Hälfte. Zwar hat Bayern von den Zahlungen profitiert, aber mittlerweile mehr eingezahlt, als es jemals bekommen hat. Und das Problem ist auch nicht, daß Bayern sich mit anderen Bundesländern solidarisch - je nach Sichtweise - zeigt oder zeigen muß, das Problem ist vielmehr, daß es einige Bundesländer gibt, welche die Solidarzahlungen nicht genutzt haben, um sich zu konsolidieren, wie es Bayern getan hat, sondern sich entspannt zurücklehnen. Übrigens kritisiert nicht nur Bayern den Länderfinanzausgleich, auch ist Hessen mit von der Partie.

Turkey is almost completely within Asia, and the core parts of the early Ottoman state were in Anatolia. Turkey's *colonies* were in Europe - in Balkans. So in a way your comparison is justified - it makes equaly as much sense to call Turkey ""European"", as it makes for calling Russia ""Asian"".

Yes that much is true but in the post war context France and Germany had fought two wars against each other in a 30 year period and given their geographic location to one another it was vital that animosity between the two was removed. The EU and to a lesser extent French rule over west germany certainly helped this.

&gt;But come on, it's ridiculous to claim that there isn't any kind of pan-European culture. While each culture is obviously distinct, everything from the arts, literature, philosophy, to business and science are influenced by each trends and flows from other countries.

To a certain extent you are correct but not on a pan continental scale. I mean absolutely you have pan cultures in Iberia, Ireland/UK, Germany/Austria, Former Yugoslavia etc but I dont see it on a full scale. Ireland has more in common with the wider anglosphere in US/Canada/Australia than it does with a lot of EU member states.

&gt;You can't understand contemporary Danish society without a solid understanding of Foucault, and you can't analyse Ireland without Žižek. It's all deeply, deeply interconnected and interrelated, and that's what makes for a pan-European culture.

Ma al ristorante puoi ordinare quello che vuoi ed è un tuo diritto fare richieste ragionevoli per rimanere fedeli alle proprie convinzioni etiche. Se un ristorante non ha in menù nessun piatto vegan-friendly (cosa un po' improbabile) puoi sempre farti preparare qualcosa al momento come un'insalata o della pasta al pomodoro.  
Io mi riferivo a situazioni come quelle descritte nell'articolo in cui non c'è praticamente possibilità di scelta, ad esempio cene a buffet con pietanze preparate in anticipo (che di solito vengono spazzolate completamente prima della fine, vegani o meno) oppure inviti presso persone che non sapevano del tuo particolare regime alimentare.

*2*

**Denken Sie es ist für die Bundesrepublik wichtig, dass Bayern sich nicht abspaltet?**

**Denken Sie eine Abspaltung Bayerns ist rechtens?**

*Ja*

**Sind Sie für oder gegen eine Abspaltung Bayerns?**

*Ich bin komplett dagegen*

**Optionaler Zusatz:**

*Eine Abspaltung Bayerns wäre dann legitim und zu akzeptieren, wenn sich eine Zwei-Drittel-Mehrheit der Stimmberechtigten(!) dafür entscheiden würde. Gleiches gilt selbstverständlich für jedes andere Bundesland oder jede andere Region. Ob man 'Zugezogene' auch abstimmen lässt, oder nur Personen die in Bayern geboren wurden, müsste gesondert diskutiert werden.*

*Persönlich würde ich die hypothetische Abspaltung Bayerns für falsch halten.
Die Konsequenzen für Bayern und 'Rest-Deutschland' wären negativ.
Auch erschließt sich mir der Sinn des Ganzen nicht. 
Die Kritik aus Bayern (und anderen Ländern) am Länderfinanzausgleich kann ich allerdings nachvollziehen. Und über eine alternative Regelung kann man in Zukunft zumindest nachdenken.*


**edit:** Wenn ich noch mal so drüber nachdenke, eine Zwei-Drittel-Mehrheit der abgegebenen Stimmen kann auch legitim sein. Wer mit dem Status quo einverstanden ist, sollte auch einmal seinen Arsch hochbekommen können und gegen eine Abspaltung stimmen. Wem es dieser ""Aufwand"" nicht wert ist, dem ist es eh scheißegal.

Was ich bei der Abstimmung im Vereinigten Königreich nicht verstanden habe ist, dass 50,01% der abgegeben Stimmen gereicht hätten. Für eine so weitreichende Entscheidung sollte es mMn mindestens eine Zwei-Drittel-Mehrheit sein. Ansonsten halt Status quo.

Nietzsche hammered this point home in *The Birth of Tragedy*. 

The author would be better off pointing out how the Enlightenment paved the way for science to take precedence over religion than to attempt to show that the Bible encourages critical thought. 

&gt;Finally, what we have defined as Western, values that while ​​born in the West are all essentially universal. For example, significant, Liu Xiaobo, the Democratic and jailed leader of China, asserts and appropriates the philosophy of the Western Enlightenment: he considers it universal while yet remaining completely Chinese.

This could be a translation issue, but if Liu has to ""appropriate"" something, that means its not from his culture. This is why a privileged white singer who becomes successful by acting like an inner-city black kid is considered ""appropriation""; she is using culture that is not her own in her work. Therefore, the fact that Liu had to appropriate Enlightenment values assumes that such ideas were not an established part of Chinese culture to begin with, and contradicts the idea that such values are universal. 

I'm glad to see some political philosophy on here, but this bit isn't that strong. I think the writer ought to go more in depth the explain which elements of societies encourage critical thinking and why, along with detailing which countries tend to have such elements.

That is not even close to true, the extremely Armenian looking Greeks sure but that is not many people.

Ranging from Far east-Asian in looks to Armenian and Balkan pheno-types and everything in between. There is around 1 or 2 people in that crowd who could possibly be mistaken for Greek or Bulgarian but it is still debateable. Out of the many Turks Ive met in my life there was one female and one male that had Greek features but the one main difference that I noticed is the eyes. Turks even with Greek features still retain an Asiatic/European hybrid eye shape.

Sure, some Turks could possibly pass for a Greek/Bulgarian but the  majority of Greek/Bulgarian/Serbian population would never be mistaken for a Turk, that is the difference. Some examples of Greek pheno-types

I don't like to bring up genetic arguments but you started it. Turks are going through an identity crisis, some of them think they are White and European(which they could be), some are proud Turkic Asians and want to allign with Turkic peoples of the East and then also a large percentage of Turks feel more closer to Arabs and hard-line Islam. 

That is why most people do not consider you European, you are a country stuck in between 3 vastly different civilizations. Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

Noam Chomsky:

 ""Putin's complaints are factually accurate. When President Gorbachev accepted the unification of Germany as part of NATO - an astonishing concession in the light of history - there was a quid pro quo. Washington agreed that NATO would not move ""one inch eastward,"" referring to East Germany.

The promise was immediately broken, and when Gorbachev complained, he was instructed that it was only a verbal promise, so without force.

President Clinton proceeded to expand NATO much farther to the east, to Russia's borders. Today there are calls to extend NATO even to Ukraine, deep into the historic Russian ""neighborhood."" But it ""doesn't involve"" the Russians, because its responsibility to ""uphold peace and stability"" requires that American red lines are at Russia's borders.

...Russia has a far stronger case. Even apart from strong internal support for the annexation, Crimea is historically Russian; it has Russia's only warm-water port, the home of Russia's fleet; and has enormous strategic significance. 

**This way of thinking from Noam Chomsky is exactly what the author of the article unmasked as the new form of Orientalism.**

false,TheConnivingPedant,EURO,The United States of Europe,"Chomsky does have a valid criticism, which is pointing out Western hypocrisy when they talk about liberal values when is suits them and act as warmongering imperialists when it doesn't. He's right, but two wrongs don't make right. The correct position is to denounce and protest against our governments when they do it, not to shrug our shoulders when Putin does it.

The rest are pure Putin appologia. The Guardian gave a British academic space to explain how Russia wants to maintiain its great power status and defend against a ""immediate and severe threat to its interests"", namely a Ukrainian government without Yanukovich. But, don't worry this is not a ""neo-imperialist land-grab"".

Ron Paul is being isolationist, as he's always been. He's essentially a right-wing American anti-Imperialist. Ok, fair enough.

John J. Mearsheimer is one of those American foreign policy mandarins, dyed-in-the-wool imperialist who spells it out succinctly: 
&gt;Putin’s pushback should have come as no surprise. After all, the West had been moving into Russia’s backyard and threatening its core strategic interests, a point Putin made emphatically and repeatedly. Elites in the United States and Europe have been blindsided by events only because they subscribe to a flawed view of international politics. They tend to believe that the logic of realism holds little relevance in the twenty-first century and that Europe can be kept whole and free on the basis of such liberal principles as the rule of law, economic interdependence, and democracy.
It is, he claims the West who provoke Putin.

The French guys are totally off the wall. M Faye, a ""French and European patriot"" explains how accepting former Warsaw Pact countries into the EU and NATO is a provocation (as well as ""an economic mistake for everybody"") and talk about the ""legitimate annexation"" of Crimea. The other guy is some random radical lefty ranting about Nazis and ""Novorossiya"".

Nowhere did I see more then a throwaway line about Ukrainians ""They have to sort out their own problems"", according to the Brit and Ron Paul. This is pretty much the level of discourse I've seen in the mainstream press - I totally agree with OP's article because this is something I've noticed a long time ago.

I think your fears of people using the accusation of Orientalism as a cudgel to stifle debate are unfounded (it's a pretty obscure concept anyway). The problem is that people barely acknowledge the Ukrainians exist, let alone criticise their ideas and choices - which are hard to properly discern amongst all the propaganda and blatant fabrications flying about.

On more thing, it's interesting to note that most for these articles come from people on the extreme ends of the political spectrum.

Some states pay 45% more in federal taxes than they get back in the form of federal spending. The rich urban states roughly give up 1/3 of the federal taxes they pay. 

Even using more conservative figure, would Germans be willing to give up between 1/4 and 1/3 of their tax revenue to promote a more cohesive currency union? Doing so has many benefits, but seems like it would be a tough sell politically, especially if you look at the Greece negotiations. To bail out Greece it took months of negotiating, the involvement of the ECB, Germany, the IMF and others. Despite the size of Greece's economy, because it is connected to other major economies via the Euro, its impending default caused havoc in markets from London, to New York, to Tokyo. After months an agreement was finally reached and things settled down. 

When Greece needed another round of funding negotiations began anew. That method of wealth transfer is haphazard and only deals with a problem once it becomes a crisis. It took countless negotiations, several international organizations, and substantial uncertainty in global markets to bail out Greece. The US state of Mississippi is bailed out by New York, California, and Illinois every two weeks by workers in those states in a line item titled: ""Federal Income Tax Withholding.""

About 300 people demonstrating on Saturday against the house of the mayor of Burgos, Javier Lacalle (PP), contrary to the remodeling of the Plaza de Toros of the Plantation, has faced riot police deployed by the center capital and has completed five men and six officers wounded, one for assaulting a police officer.

The other four were arrested for burning waste containers in various parts of the city, reported Sunday morning in a press conference the deputy Minister, José María Arribas. 

Two of those arrested are minors Detainees who have spent the night at the National Police Station and will go to court, are residents of Burgos, aged between 16 and 37 years, including two minors. 

Six policemen were injured when they tried to prevent the passage of participating in an unauthorized demonstration intended to go to the mayor, Javier Lacalle (PP) address. 

The National Police identified eight concentrations promoters, who handled administrative sanctions for failing to notify the demonstrations as they are assembled at the city center and there decided to march to the house of the mayor.

Arribas explained that to determine the scope of possible sanctions, which range between 300 and 50,000 euros, ""the severity of subsequent events"" is taken into account, the clashes with the police and damage to street furniture and broken panes of several bank offices, which have not yet been quantified.

##The third night of riots 

When the demonstrators reached the area near the home Lacalle found with effective riot that blocked their way and started a fight in which opponents of the works of the Plaza de Toros have launched various objects wastebaskets or manhole covers, while the police officers were charged and hit people with batons.

The moments of greatest tension have lived when some of the riot police have attempted to evacuate. It was then that it has arrested at least one person, who was one of the bearers of the banner the march began. 

About 10 riot vans have surrounded the block housing the mayor, while the police have also cut the circulation Boulevard Railroad.

 A group of protesters decided to move to the National Police Station to protest the arrest of their colleagues. A spokesman for the Assembly has criticized the ""police brutality"" and vows that one of the arrested youth had received ""threats"" by the agents in recent days.

Recall that the last two nights were also produced riots after respective events , but on those occasions took place in the street Vitoria, whose work for the creation of the boulevard, caused a conflict protests in the neighborhood Gamonal last January .",0,1415555962,null,0,1415556385,0,clxkwcd,t3_2ls12m,t1_clxkwcd,t3_2ls12m,null,1426111047,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

false,HappyReaper,null,null,"&gt; So the Catalans in Sydney and London should vote too? Or just the current population within Catalonia?

I would be inclined to extend the sovereignty over that decision to every Catalan citizen, even if they are not living in Catalonia at the moment, as citizenship for me implies membership into the group, which includes the right to vote in elections or in referendums like this one. I understand the opposite point too, though, as the decisions affect those citizens to a much lesser degree than the rest of the population. Should be up to the Catalans to decide.

&gt;  What about former Catalan territories like Valencia or Islas Balleares? What about the handful of Catalan speakers up in France? 

This consultation is about the Catalan territory and its citizens, so according to the point I've been making the decision should reside on those individuals. I'm all for other regions to follow suit, if they wanted, voting for the belonging (or not) of their territory in Spain. If two independent regions then, for cultural similarities or because whatever reason, had a dominant support for becoming one, then that would be fine, too.

&gt; Who gets to vote? 16 and up? 5 years of residence, or no residence requirements?

This question is similar to the first one in that it's very subjective. The Catalan people should decide together the nature of the democratic process, with the most obvious option (in my opinion) being using the same criteria than for elections (as they supposedly contemplate the same issues).

&gt; And 50% + 1 vote or a super majority of 2/3rds?

According to my understanding of democracy, 50% + 1 vote should be enough, because in a binary decision with no middle ground (independence or not), I see it as more democratic to follow the will of the 50% + 1 against the 50% - 1 than vice-versa.

&gt; And what is the minimum participation necessary?

Another subjective question to be answered by the Catalan people. We want to ensure that in an important decision there has been enough debate for people to make informed decisions, but at the same time, it would be no sense in a vote that is known to be close for the ""status quo"" side to win by default by staying at home.

I personally am partial to a system of ""not enough participation -&gt; repeat referendum after a delay with reduced participation threshold"". If say, the participation is less than 60% (for example), the referendum is delayed 2 months; debate ensues, and then 40% participation is required; and so on, reducing the threshold every time until it reaches an agreed minimum, and after that just repeating the referendum with that minimum.

&gt; However these questions are resolved make for very different outcomes and all are democratic.

Agreed. All of those questions in the end should be resolved democratically by the people of Catalonia in order to decide how they want to make their decision. As mentioned earlier, using the same system than for elections is an acceptable choice by default, as most people seem to agree with them regarding those questions.

&gt; But all of them ignore the fact that 90% of Catalonia voted for a constitution that requires this very decision to be made on a national level by the democratically elected national parliament, not by the autonomous regions individually. 

Correct, and it is irrelevant for various reasons. A very obvious one is that the population back then was very different to the population right now. Another one is that they were choosing between two options neither of which contemplated independence as an option, and even if that had been the case, there were so many other parameters at play than no conclusions could be extracted about how the Catalan people back then felt about independence in particular.

I would go even further than that: if there had been an official referendum not 36 years ago but last month, and today there was new information that would strongly suggest that the distribution of opinion had changed, I would support a new referendum in order to make sure that reality corresponds with the will of the people. Same in the case of Catalonia gaining independence: if it seemed that most people regretted that decision and wanted to come back (assuming Spain's agreement), a referendum should be held in that regard.",0,1415556110,null,0,false,0,clxkz14,t3_2loaxn,t1_clxkz14,t1_clxe3af,null,1426111012,1,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,1

false,Knusperkuhsnack,null,null,"&gt; Bayern war bis zur Gründung des deutschen Kaiserreichs lange Zeit unabhängig und trägt auch heute noch den Titel ""Freistaat Bayern"".

Trifft auf viele Regionen zu, Bayern ist kein Sonderfall.

z.B. war das Land Oldenburg bis zum Nationalsozialismus immer unabhängig. Nach dem Weltkrieg ist Oldenburg dann durch eine Verordnung der britischen Militärregierung mit anderen Ländern im Land Niedersachsen aufgegangen (zumindest 'Kern-Oldenburg', ohne die Exklaven).

Zweimal (1956 und 1975) gab es Volksentscheide in denen sich die Bürger für eine Loslösung von Niedersachsen und Eigenständigkeit entschieden. Der Bundestag hat dies per Gesetz (1976) abgelehnt.
Hat definitv ein Geschmäckle, aber aufgrund der geringen Beteiligung bei den Volksentscheiden, kann man es ein wenig nachvollziehen.

Artikel des Spiegel: http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41560863.html

Aber selbst heute ist Oldenburg noch präsent, nicht nur im kulturellen Bereich, sondern auch in Verbänden/Gruppierungen/Parteien. Es gibt z.B. den Landesverband Oldenburg bei der CDU oder beim DRK.

Was ich damit eigentlich sagen will ist, Bayern ist nichts besonderes in Deutschland. Den heutigen Titel ""Freistaat"" tragen auch Thüringen und Sachsen. Ich kann die Kritik vieler Leute aus Bayern, z.B. am Länderfinanzausgleich, absolut verstehen und teile diese zum Teil auch. Aber dieses Getue, dass es einerseits Bayern gibt und andererseits Deutschland, ist lächerlich.

Of course, in spite of some hotheads on all three sides, most people certainly do not want another round of fighting. The previous conflict not only resulted in tens of thousands of deaths, but also impoverished the region and and ground any prospects for normal development to a halt for the foreseeable future. I honestly think that it's only the sobering reality of the real cost of war that most Bosnians have witnesses in their lives that has prevented a second round of hostilities from breaking out since then in spite of the permanent tension that continue to envelop the country. 

However, loath as I am to see another war, if one were to break out, I would find it hard not to take part. If Republika Srpska were defeated in the war, it would mean that it would be forced to become a part of a unitary Bosnian state, a status contrary to the clear will of the overwhelming majority of people in the republic. In this case, the question would become not one of nationalism and petty tribal squabbles, but about the fundamental right to self-determination and the right to a government that has the consent of those subjected to its rule. At the risk of sounding ridiculous, what would be at stake would be nothing short than the liberty of Bosnian Serbs, and to defend this liberty I am more than willing to wear the [Serbian cockade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGjptvq8ldI)!",0,1415556576,null,0,1415556822,0,clxl7m2,t3_2lrx16,t1_clxl7m2,t3_2lrx16,null,1426110900,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

C'est plus compliqué que ça.

Ces derniers sont sous la tutelle du ministre de la Justice, donc du pouvoir executif. Étant donné qu'ils peuvent apprécier l'opportunité de poursuivre (ou non) et qu'ils sont actifs dans la procédure judiciaire, ils (le pouvoir executif en l'occurence) peuvent bien l'accéler ou la ralentir selon le stade où elle se trouve.  

Ce lien entre parquet et exécutif est pour moi anti-démocratique et n'est là que pour s'assurer d'une certaine emprise, certes faible mais non négligeable, du pouvoir politique sur le judiciaire.

Pour parler concret, j’ai eu la chance d’aller à un des meilleurs collèges à Paris, et je peux compter les profs utilisant fréquemment des slides sur les doigts d’une main.

Pas non plus de tableaux « interactifs », connus pour leur expérience utilisateur désastreuse, juste des ordis + projecteurs qui sont beaucoup plus utiles (et puis un Mac mini de 500 € par classe c’est pas pire qu’un iPad de 500 € par élève, hein).

Is a JOKE. One fat blob of lard prancing around some degenerated scrap metal passing itself off as a tank. 

I'm sure you get the picture. You are full of nonsense, and as Putin was LYING about his troops in Crimea, you are LYING again now. That's what Russians do: LIE. 

They lie about boys being crucified, they lie about MH17 being ""shot down by Ukraine"", they lie about separatist leadership, which until recently consisted mostly of Russians with ties to the FSB en GRU, Russians deny everything, and enjoy the aftermath. It's par for the course. Ukraine has not lost this many tanks and trucks, has not confirmed that the material seen was lost, the text on the trucks is in Russian, not Ukrainian, the uniforms are Russian, the column is far too large for the ragtag ""separatists"" to manage.

You Russians lie and deny so much, there's a subreddit dedicated to the ridiculization of it: /r/RussiaDenies

Whenever I see Putin on TV, who is to know it isn't a body double? Everything is possible. But that doesn't make it reasonable or probable or likely, now does it, Russian?

&gt; Russia has invaded Ukraine and now there is irrefutable proof.

&gt; Today a Krasnodon local riding on trolleybus route Nr.1 connecting Krasnodon with Molodohvardiysk filmed a Russian mechanized column near the village of Sukhodolsk on its way towards Luhansk.

&gt; There is no doubt that the video was taken inside Ukraine. The location has been geolocated as at the 40 second mark a street sign comes into view: M04-E40 (see below). The M04-E40 begins at the Russian-Ukrainian border passes South of Luhansk and splits in Debaltseve where the E40 continues along the M03. Therefore the video was undeniably taken deep inside Ukraine.

&gt; At least 13 T-72BM main battle tanks, 42 BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles, 6 MT-LB armored personnel carries, 31 troop carrying trucks, a regimental headquarters, armored ambulances, engineering vehicles and at least 15 fuel trucks in the same color scheme carrying at least a thousand troops is without a doubt a regular unit of the Russian Armed Forces. Even more so as the tanks are of the T-72BM model, which are only in service with the Russian Army. Also, the soldiers all wear standard issue Russian uniform and in case of the truck transported infantry the newest Russian Army camouflage (below).

&gt; Further proof that this is a regular Russian military unit comes from the Russian language warning “огнеопасно” (flammable) on the columns fuel trucks, a warning that would be in Ukrainian language (“вогненебезпечно“) if these trucks had been captured from the Ukrainian Army.

&gt; The so-called rebels and their apologists already claim that the “local self-defense forces” captured all of this equipment from the Ukrainian Army. This would require one to believe that the rebels managed to capture an entire regiment worth of undamaged equipment (not accounting for the plethora of exclusively Russian-made tanks); and also captured an entire set of ambulances, command and control trucks, fuel tanks and engineering vehicles that are typical of a Russian mechanized regiment. We would also need to believe in this scenario that the “rebels” managed to capture it all at the same time in an area where the Ukrainian army does not operate and on top of that we should believe that the “rebels” had over a 1,000 men in Russian military uniform at hand to man the “captured vehicles.”

&gt; Bullshit.

&gt; This is a Russian military unit inside Ukraine advancing towards the front with everything that is needed to fight.

&gt; This is the smoking gun.

&gt; But we already knew that, right?

&gt; No, as you yourself would abandon them.

There was no independence movement worth speaking about before what happened with the Estatut.

The Estatut was negotiated with Spain, written with spain, ok'd from Spain and only then voted in referendum and approved by the Catalan population.

But ultimately, as you can see, whole ""independence thing"" is because we've already exhausted everything else.

It is clinging to symbols, flags, traditions and ethnicity, things that really shouldn't guide us if we want to grow as a civilization.

&gt;A lot of separatisms in the past where due to the majority of people in a country being subjugated by another country. 

Yes, my point exactly. This is not the case now in Europe. Separatists like Catalans and Scots often already have huge autonomy and are not kept by force.

Oh, thank you for that novelty.. Could you explain me then, smartass, why they don't form part of a coalition with the European left? You know, a bigger group that defends cultural identity of the peoples of Europe? Why didn't they got an agreement with EH? Etc.

&gt; Do you know how hard is to be the leader of the oppostion in the middle of a crisis?

It seems you don't understand politics. CiU and ERC formed a governmental pact. True, they didn't deliver ministers, but they're not opposition either.

&gt; Of course they are going to take fire for some of their decisions!

Yes, if you put flags before people, then yes, some people will criticize you, **especially** if they suffer from *retallades*. 

&gt; Which means they need some opposition time with enough representation to matter, same goes for Podem and Guanyem, I won't trust them before that.

Having critique is easy, and doesn't prove anything. That's why we should have parties in the government **that aren't involved in corruption**. That means no PP, no CiU, no PSOE/PSC, no ICV, no IU/EUiA, no PNV, no ERC. People that vote for any of those parties are supporting corruption, whether they see themselves as left- or as rightwing.

&gt; They want independence for Països catalans. Really now.

No, that's **not their end-goal**. They favour municipalism. Anyway, what's wrong with wanting independence or centralization as long as it's by vote? 

&gt; In the middle of a crisis, with a crapton of debt, with a secession process... yeah, what could possibly go wrong?

Look at *football*.

Those are justifications, better and worse ones, but they are not *reasons*. The reason is one, very simple thing:

Population. 75 million people, and not exactly decreasing. Of the EU countries, only Germany is bigger, and not by much (5 million). Next smaller ones are France (66) and the UK (64). Turkey joining would completely unhinge any balance there is in EU politics. Can you imagine the outcry when suddenly, there's not a Franco-German axis (which we all love and hate), but a German-Turkish one?

*Maybe*, once we actually have a proper European politics, with *actually* pan-european parties, where national differences are irrelevant at the EU level, such a thing could be weathered. But then we're talking two, three generations from now at the earliest, and it would also mean quite some federalisation, which, as we all know, not everyone is keen on.

If Finland would get invaded, the Finnish government together with the local US embassy would try to evacuate you immediately. If evacuation outside the country would be impossible, you would be evacuated internally to rural Finland with the rest of the civilian population that doesn't have designated role in the government or in industries.

If there would be a continued conflict, I think that you could join civilian services to support the war effort. If shit really hit the fan, meaning that the Finnish army is routed, the state has ceased to exits and the remnant of the Finnish army are giving weapons and ammunition to anyone willing and able, I don't see any reason why they wouldn't give you a weapon.

Que ça coïncide avec les intérêts de certains oligarques européens, c'est sûr, que ça coïncide avec les intérêts des peuples européens, alors qu'on a un taux de chômage record en Europe et que l'Ukraine a un salaire moyen [du même niveau que la Chine](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaire_moyen_par_pays)... c'est beaucoup moins sûr.

Bah oui, on a beaucoup plus d'intérêts en Russie qu'en Ukraine. Donc beaucoup moins intérêt à se les mettre à dos.

&gt;Tu sembles soudainement essayer de mettre la France hors du bloc occidental

Le bloc occidental n'existe pas, la voie de la France est celle d'un intermédiaire entre les grandes puissances. C'est ce qu'elle faisait sous de Gaulle, c'est ce qu'elle a fait pendant la guerre en Iraq. Malheureusement depuis on s'est alignés sur les US avec nos deux présidents atlantistes Sarko et Hollande.

Les pays ont des intérêts divergents et doivent donc avoir des politiques internationales divergentes.

&gt;tandis que beaucoup des interventions US sont directement appuyer par la France et l'Allemagne

Il faudrait prendre au cas par cas.

&gt;Tu semble penser que dans tout ce que les USA ont fait la France n'a eu aucune complicité(le cas des balkans) et tu sembles vouloir séparer la France du bloc occidental.

La France a des complicités que je dénonce. Encore une fois ce n'est pas la première fois que les dirigeants français n'agissent pas pour les intérêts français. Et oui, je rejette le concept même d'occident.

&gt;Alors en quoi c'est une menace

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony

L'hégémonie américaine est une menace pour l'équilibre du monde.

Il y a deux théories en réalisme international :

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagoning

et

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balancing_(international_relations)

Je suis en faveur de l'équilibre des puissances et contre l'hégémonie américaine.

&gt;est ce que sa voudrait dire que l’Europe entière doit être hostile envers la France?

Quel est le rapport ? Où tu vois ça dans mes commentaires ?

&gt;et s'éloigner de la France parce que la France a une plus grosse armées que ses voisins?

Je n'ai pas parlé ""d'avoir une plus grosse armée que ses voisins"".

36% du budget mondial, ce n'est pas juste une plus grosse armée que ses voisins, c'est de l'hégémonie impérialiste qui a fait qu'on ne peut pas empêcher les US d'envahir d'autres pays comme ils l'ont fait en Iraq.

&gt;La vérité est que le budget immense des USA sert mon pays puisque qu'on est pas obligé d'investir dans défense , l'Allemagne en profite , le Japon , les philippines , la Corée du sud en profite parce qu'elle les garantit de la protection et aucun de ses pays ne voudraient que ses bases disparaissent et sont sources d'immenses profits. De même en Pologne et en Lituanie sa fait depuis 11 ans qu'on les attend.

Bah oui. Vous êtes alignés sur les US et complètement dépendants.

La France aspire à l'indépendance et si l'Europe politique existait, elle devrait aspirer à l'indépendance.

Je n'oublie pas que les US voulaient installer en France un gouvernement marionnette (AMGOT), et que Mitterrand avait prévenu de cela :

*La France ne le sait pas, mais nous sommes en guerre avec l’Amérique. Oui, une guerre permanente, une guerre vitale, une guerre économique, une guerre sans mort apparemment.
Oui, ils sont très durs les américains, ils sont voraces, ils veulent un pouvoir sans partage sur le monde.
C’est une guerre inconnue, une guerre permanente, sans mort apparemment et pourtant une guerre à mort.*

&gt;Aucune , zéro , nada

Bien sûr que si puisqu'ils déclenchent des guerres et des révolutions en Europe.

&gt;Les élites du bloc occidental ont tous les mêmes intérêts(libre échange , circulation et libre entreprise)

Non. Les élites ont leurs propres intérêts. Les peuples ont des intérêts divergents qui ne sont pas ceux des élites ni les mêmes dans chaque pays. Je me fous totalement des élites, ce sont mes ennemis.

&gt;Ingrate pourquoi?

Qu'est ce que la Pologne a fait pour la France et pour l'Europe ?

Maintenant regarde combien l'UE file à la Pologne.

&gt;Tu laissais entendre que les ingérences américaines en Europe ont causé plus de mort que ceux de l Russie

Non. Relis au lieu de faire un strawman.

Here:

In the book of Job, the reader witnesses a controversy (inconceivable in any other revealed religion) between Job, mere mortal and his God. Because God inflicts punishment upon him that he judges to be illogical, Job protests and criticizes God. God concedes and restores the good fortune of Job but arguing that, since he was God, his actions do not have to be justified. Job replied, ""I submit,"" but in doing so he still have the last word; remember that God, after this final critical exchange, then does not reappear again in any the following books of the Bible, he instead from there on out never speaks to man directly. Joining the Jewish and Christian theology, therefore leads to challenging every idea. Even those which (a priori) is revealed from on high. 

&gt; Yeah. ""having the last word"" does not equal ""questioning authority is encouraged in the Bible"". Citing Job to prove this point is bizarre.

Again it was a translation issue. What really he really means by saying ""having the last word"" is not that he had the last words in this particular exchange but that after this exchange with Job, God will never speak directly to another human being again. This is profound, 

And citing Job is not at all bizarre, it's story contains a controversy between a man and God, and the man ends up winning the controversy. Job criticized the divine order of the universe, and the divine order of the universe accepts Jobs argument and reorders itself in response.

L'Ukraine n'a rien à faire ni dans l'OTAN, ni dans l'UE.

Et non, elle n'a pas du tout ""commencé"" à les rejoindre. Avec un salaire moyen égal à celui de la Chine et une corruption alarmante, il faudra des décennies avant qu'elle soit éligible à une entrée dans l'UE.

Quant à rejoindre l'OTAN, ça fait des années qu'on avait prévenus de la menace que ça consisterait pour la Russie. [Tiens](http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2008/04/03/01003-20080403ARTFIG00592-otan-la-georgie-et-l-ukraine-devront-attendre.php), voilà un article de avril 2008 :

*La France et l'Allemagne s'étaient opposées à l'ouverture immédiate du processus d'adhésion de ces deux pays, estimant qu'elle aggraverait les relations déjà tendues avec la Russie. D'ailleurs, le vice-ministre russe des Affaires étrangères Alexandre Grouchko, a rapidement réagi estimant que l'entrée de la Géorgie et de l'Ukraine dans l'Otan constituerait «une erreur stratégique» aux «conséquences les plus sérieuses» pour la sécurité en Europe.*

On se souvient de ce qu'il s'est passé 4 mois plus tard en Géorgie.

La Russie se défend face à ce qu'elle considère comme une agression qui fait suite à de nombreuses autres ingérences étrangères, c'est le même scénario bien rôdé à chaque fois :

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJBO_f2J-cQ

Les États-Unis font strictement la même chose en Amérique du Sud, il faut arrêter avec l'angélisme.

http://knowmore.washingtonpost.com/2014/02/11/half-a-century-of-u-s-interventions-in-latin-america-in-one-map/

Bref, l'Ukraine est divisée entre une population pro-Russie et une autre tournée vers l'ouest. Lui faire rejoindre l'OTAN ou l'UE va forcément nuire à sa stabilité et la solution de paix doit forcément prendre en compte la Russie.

&gt;La France fait parti de l’OTAN et de l’Union Européenne

It's the fact that people from outside the country, in almost any countries with large romanian communities, had to wait in line hours to be able to vote. Many of them were also unable to do so, as the voting ended before them being able to enter the voting station, even if arriving a few hours earlier.

People think that this bad administration of outside voting has been done on purpose, as the outside vote is heavily against the candidate of the ruling party. In the first round, he (Ponta) got 19% of the vote, while his main rival (Iohannis) received almost 50%. Overall, with the votes from inside the country added, Ponta had 40%, Iohannis 30%.

Round 2 is predicted to be closer, so Ponta would have every interest to limit the number of votes coming from outside the country.

Geographical midpoint doesn't really mean anything when dealing with human-made arbitrary divisions.

&gt;I agree, and that's also why it's unfair to group us together with Mordor like that. I can't speak for the Baltics, but Poland, Czechs and Hungary were always ""Western"" (Antemurale and all that) and some Russian occupation doesn't really change that. We were western before the partitions, western between the world wars and we're western now, and I hope grouping Poland as ""eastern european"" will disappear forever once we get our economy going from the soviet mess.

Unfortunately, all that takes a backseat to the part of history that people actually remember living through, namely the cold war era. It's unfortunate, but until that recedes to the back of the human consciousness, countries that would rather not be lumped together with ""Mordor"" will be in the mind of a lot of people.

Sure those numbers show youth unemployment v. stay-at-homes in 2012 so one might say that these people are still at home because they're unemployed.

[This study](http://ftp.iza.org/dp2042.pdf) seems to comment on numbers from 2000 (when in the South things were still sufficiently dandy?) and mentions a number of other studies that seem to interpret those numbers from 2012 either as the result of economic problems in the South or as what I call lazy kids that love their parents' standard of living but can't afford their own.

This unpopular opinion of mine is apparently one of a number of arguments put forward by people researching these trends.

Generell ist es wie /u/oldandgreat schon sagte so, dass du halt viel mehr auf dich allein gestellt bist. Das hat Vor- und Nachteile. Du bist natürlich viel freier in deinen Entscheidungen, musst aber halt auch die Verantwortung dafür übernehmen.

Wenn du Lust hast, schiebst du deine Kurse vor dir her und schreibst 2 Klausuren pro Semester. Dann hast du vermutlich ein recht laues Leben an der Uni, kommst aber mit dem Studium nicht voran.

Ob du zu den Vorlesungen gehst oder nicht ist da schon eher die spannende Frage, einige kann man sich nämlich wirklich klemmen, das musste aber selbst rausfinden welche das für dich sind.

Ein großer aufrichtigst ernst gemeinter Tipp von mir: Versuche nicht, alleine durchs Studium zu gehen. Such dir Leute mit denen du dich gut verstehst, triff dich mit denen zum Lernen, zum Saufen, zum Grillen, zum in die Mensa gehen, was auch immer. Und tu das so früh wie möglich. Gerade am Anfang sind alle neu da und versuchen sich zu orientieren, geh da offen auf die Leute zu (in der O-Woche erledigt das in der Regel der Alkohol) und verbünde dich mit denen.

Wenn du einen Durchhänger hast kannst du von denen wieder motiviert werden am Ball zu bleiben, wenn du krank bist kannst du die wichtigsten Infos aus den entsprechenden Kursen kriegen und wenn du freie Zeit zwischen Kursen und wirklich nichts zu tun hast hast du immernoch Leute mit denen du dir die Zeit vertreiben kannst.

Es gibt halt keine ""Klasse"" mehr, die zwangsweise zusammen bleibt, wenn da einer auf der Strecke bleibt dann ist das halt so, den letzten beißen die Hunde. :)

Aus eigener Erfahrung kann ich dir auch raten so lang es geht bei deinen Eltern zu wohnen. Keinen (oder kaum) finanziellen Druck während des Studiums zu haben ist echt was wert. Klar bringt es einige Freiheiten mit sich, in eine eigene Wohnung zu ziehen, aber wenn du dich neben dem Studium um die Miete, den Stromanbieter, den lästigen Internetanbieter, den Hausflur und den ganzen Kram kümmern musst geht da mehr Zeit für drauf als man so denkt. Das kann stressig werden.

Zum Alltag kann man glaube ich nicht viel sagen, der hängt stark von deinem Stundenplan ab, aber mein Tag morgen sieht so aus:

Vorlesung von 8:00 - 12:00, danach setz ich mich irgendwo in einen der PC-Pools und bereite ne Präsentation für Mittwoch vor, gehe dann je nachdem wie ich fertig bin und wer noch so da ist in die Mensa, bin um 13:30 - 16 Uhr in einem Praktikum, da gibts halt n paar Hilfestellungen von Tutoren zu Übungsaufgaben die man machen kann, falls man was nicht verstanden hat, Fragen oder Schwierigkeiten hat. 16:00 - 17:30 hab ich noch ne weitere Vorlesung, danach fahr ich nach Hause und je nach dem wie weit ich gekommen bin, setze ich mich nochmal an die Präsi. An anderen Tagen sieht es anders aus, aber so ähnlich kann man sich das vorstellen.

Ich hoffe der Text ist nicht zu lang geworden und gibt dir nen kleinen Einblick, wenn du noch Fragen hast, immer her damit, gern auch per PM. :)",0,1415562573,null,0,false,0,clxoeu3,t3_2ls18g,t1_clxoeu3,t1_clxnjkz,null,1426109371,5,false,de,t5_22i0,5

false,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; How realistic is this plan in 2014? It reeks to me of WW2 frontline war mentality. 

It actually reeks cold war mentality. Just one big nuclear bomb to Helsinki would wipe out 1/5 of whole population. Thus in any case it is good idea to move everybody out from the cities who are not absolutely needed. Anyways, what do you have to loose, those people are not needed in the cities.

&gt; If Russia is bombarding near and inside our cities and an invasion is happening from air, land and sea, the game would be over within weeks. What purpose would it serve to move a couple million people to cabins and homes in the middle of the forest? So we could surrender with slightly less civilian casualties?

In the worst case scenario the war would start with a surprise attack against Helsinki with parachute regiments trying to take over the capital. In the same time armored columns would cross the border. However things aren't that bad, the Finnish air force and defense has quite good equipment thus Russian would not get air superiority. They couldn't get air superiority even during Georgian war! And we have quite good armored forces that could definitely bog down the enemy.

Yes, it is true that in full scale war for example our air force would be depleted from air-to-air missiles in two weeks. However if that would really happen, Russian casualties would have to be enormous. We shouldn't also forget that we wouldn't be fighting a war of our own, this would be just one front in grand war. For example one story that I have heard is that when Finland was in the 90s choosing a new fighter aircraft, one American general said that in case of war, for every plane gone down, they would give new one for free, as long as we have pilots.",0,1415563621,null,0,false,0,clxoyvx,t3_2lrx16,t1_clxoyvx,t1_clxob9m,null,1426109040,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

&gt;&gt;*For a topical guide to this subject, see [Outline of the metric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_the_metric_system).*

&gt;The __International System of Units__ (abbreviated __SI__ from [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): *Le __S__ystème __I__nternational d'Unités*) is the modern form of the [metric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system) and is the world's most widely used [system of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_of_measurement), used in both everyday [commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce) and [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science). It comprises a [coherent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(units_of_measurement\)) system of [units of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement) built around seven [base units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit), 22 named and an indeterminate number of unnamed coherent [derived units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_derived_unit), and a set of [prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix) that act as decimal-based multipliers. It is part of the [International System of Quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Quantities).

&gt;The standards, published in 1960 as the result of an initiative started in 1948, are based on the [metre–kilogram–second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mks_system_of_units) (MKS) system, rather than the [centimetre–gram–second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre%E2%80%93gram%E2%80%93second_system_of_units) (CGS) system, which, in turn, had several variants. The SI has been declared to be an evolving system; thus prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th [CGPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures) meeting in the final quarter of 2014 will consider a proposal to change the definitions of some base units, particularly the [kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram). 

&gt;====

&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/Lmuciri.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SI_base_unit.svg) - *The seven SI base units and the interdependency of their definitions. Clockwise from top: kelvin \(temperature\), second \(time\), metre \(length\), kilogram \(mass\), candela \(luminous intensity\), mole \(amount of substance\) and ampere \(electric current\). The second of time, kelvin and kilogram are defined independently of any other base units. The metre is defined in terms of the speed of light, so depends upon the definition of the second. The definitions of the other base units are more complicated.*

To go back to your question, because contingencies, including geographical ones, matter.  Why Turkey and not Iran?  Or Israel?  It's very likely that adjacent countries to any large political unit will share values, history, and culture with that unit, but that doesn't make them part of it.  There is a point where you draw the line and there will be nothing to it than a long list of contingent reasons, including geographical, historical, cultural, religious, and political in a varying mix that may not be clearly defined but guides members of the EU to recognize some states as potential candidates, while withholding the same recognition from others.

As an aside, the struggle to define the identity of the EU is clearly displayed in its very title.  It is a union of countries bound by a set of values touted to be universal, which means they can be adopted by any country, but it is also rooted contextually in a specific part of the world.

I am not against expanding the union to include Turkey, but that would not be European in any form or manner.  If at one point in the future, we decide to shed the E in the EU and expand the Union to something much larger, then I can see very well how Turkey can be included.

[Lostarmour.info](http://lostarmour.info/spoils/) is the only webpage trying to recompile all the transition of gear from one side to another. In the last months I have seen dozens of videos of captured machinery and other gear, just for the sake of example here is [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDy8wnfYzVI), [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzYLKTS0uRY),  [three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6yiv-q1mX4), [four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6c5NgoKBv0), [five (from the same place as four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsI2lUvleNg))... Some are very **NSFW**. But anyone willing to see will understand - some vehicles get burn completely and unusable, some go for spare parts, others have minor damages (the most usual is that the tracks broke) or in some cases Ukrainian soldiers just ran away from bombardment leaving the machinery behind.

And don't forget about the case when surrounded this summer many battalions of Ukrainian troops just defected to Russia ([Source](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28637569)) leaving of course all the remaining gear they had before entering our territory. It is estimated that more than 1000 Ukrainian troops escaped through Russian territory from the shelling, not imagine how much equipment is that.

And let's not forget about [captive Ukrainian soldiers](http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-separatists-prisoners-exchange/26610322.html) before the exchange there were [more than a thousand](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29130468) of them.

Don't know why would you want a source for the rebels loosing equipment, but [lostarmour.info](http://lostarmour.info) would be the most adequate source for that information.

&gt;Is a JOKE. One fat blob of lard prancing around some degenerated scrap metal passing itself off as a tank.

It's not degenerated, the oldest Bulat is from 2005. But the man admits that the machine is very broken, but it is not burnt completely, so he thinks that soon he and his crew will repair it.

&gt;I'm sure you get the picture. You are full of nonsense, and as Putin was LYING about his troops in Crimea, you are LYING again now. That's what Russians do: LIE.

Oh come on, *ad hominem*? You dont do justice to your nickname.

&gt;They lie about boys being crucified

It is unknown if it was a lie, some woman (seemed very disturbed) said that in an interview, that she heard that this happened. And they took interview from her because she is a refuge. 

&gt;they lie about MH17 being ""shot down by Ukraine""

Until the investigation is completed the responsibility lies on the country where it fell. It is no less probable that it was downed by Ukrainian army that by the rebels.

&gt;they lie about separatist leadership, which until recently consisted mostly of Russians with ties to the FSB en GRU

Two-Three men is now is a representative sample? It just Ukrainian and Western media made those people famous.

&gt;Ukraine has not lost this many tanks and trucks, has not confirmed that the material seen was lost, the text on the trucks is in Russian, not Ukrainian, the uniforms are Russian, the column is far too large for the ragtag ""separatists"" to manage.

I just provided couple of sources for their loses in personnel and armour. While trucks - those are common type, can be bough or taken from local businesses and repainted. Another thing if you had seen a [Typhoon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Kamaz_Typhoon.jpg) that would whole another question. Of course the previous argument about captured and repaired gear also works here, those couple thousands Ukrainian soldiers should have arrived there somehow.

&gt;Putin was LYING about his troops in Crimea

Western media misquoted him on purpose. He didn't said that there are no Russian troops in Crimea, because obviously there were Russian troops in Crimea since forever in this case located in around 10 military bases all over the Peninsula. He said that the local militias in Crimea are not connected with Russian Army.

So? That could be the rebel forces, or could be shot somewhere else and dubed with new audio. I wouldn't trust the guys from euromaidanpr.

false,HappyReaper,null,null,"&gt; So how is ""Catalan citizenship"" and by extension the right to vote determined?

I was going for the legal definition. Being registered as a citizen inside the region of Catalonia.

&gt; And how can you say that a decision made a few decades ago is irrelevant now?

I'm not saying it's irrelevant exclusively because of its age. I'm saying it's irrelevant mainly because of its nature of preventing a subgroup from leaving the bigger group, which I consider an inalienable right by principle*, as the rules of a group are there in order to live and decide together, so that role doesn't apply when what the subgroup wants is to stop doing so.

The age of a rule just makes it more or less likely to not correspond with the will of the people it applies to, thus it makes the fact that a subgroup of people irrelevant for determining what's the will of those living in that area right now.

Thus, the combination of a subgroup having the inherent right to leave the bigger group, in combination with the vote in 78 not being representative of the opinion of that subgroup about the matter right now, is what makes it irrelevant in my opinion.

&gt; Should all laws, contracts and agreements need to be renewed on some regular basis?

Although this doesn't apply for my views about the current topic for the already given reasons, what I think about it is: not necessarily, but either through that or other methods it's necessary that the agreement still reflects the will of every involved part. If one part wants to break the agreement then that's fine, agreement over, although that will usually affect the state of other agreements between the parts.

&gt; No, sorry, a democratic state is a continuously evolving entity

Every democratic subgroup is. Which should always for that very nature try to reflect as accurately as possible the will of the individuals in them (which should be the factor driving that evolution).

---

*Unfortunately, for very small subgroups (a single person, for instance), I can't see a way of preserving that principle in practice for various reasons and still have a functional society. I can see the principle being applicable for areas containing at least several hundreds of thousands individuals, but for smaller subgroups I would agree or not depending on the specifics of the situation.

Dem möchte ich doch vehement widersprechen. Das alleine wohnen zu lernen, wenn man mit dem Studium fertig ist und in den Beruf einsteigt, ist noch viel schlimmer.

The [2012 Eurobarometer](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf) has, among other findings, the following: Spanish comes in fourth when people are asked to rate the most useful foreign languages (English is first by a large margin, followed by German, French and Spanish closely together, and another group are Chinese, Italian and Russian). Spanish is also the fourth most widely spoken foreign language in the EU, but that's only 7% of EU citizens knowing Spanish as a foreign language.

As for native languages, Spanish is the fifth biggest native language in the EU, after German, Italian, English and French.

Sein Account ist das offensichtlichste Beispiel dafür, dass eine Zensur auf Grund von politischen Meinungen, Symphatie oder anderen subjektiven Befindlichkeiten in diesem subreddit nicht stattfindet.

&gt; Diese Lügengeschichte stinkt ja bis zum Himmel. 
Wenn man sein Profil anschaut und seine Posts durchgeht, sind ausschließlich die gelöscht worden in denen er sich über die Hetze der ÖRR beschwert, der erste vor 10(!) Tagen.
Der Nutzer wurde nicht unverzüglich nach der Löschung gebanned, vor 13h wurde dieser Thread eröffnet, die Löschung seiner rundfunkkritischen Beiträge erfolgte also noch früher. Zwei Stunden nach der Eröffnung postete /u/100ProzentAfD [4] [1] [+1] sogar noch einmal, das heißt er war auch zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch nicht gebanned. Die anderen Beiträge sind immer noch lesbar.
Was schließen wir daraus? Es wurden durch den Moderator selektiv Beiträge zensiert, die gegen den ÖRR gingen. Als dies herauskam wurde der User gebanned um eine plausible Geschichte zu konstruieren und von der Zensur abzulenken.


Die Tatsache dass er, obwohl er bestenfalls über Halbwissen verfügt, keine Hemmungen hat mich als Lügner zu bezeichnen sagt viel über seinen Charakter und war für mich Grund genug eine Konversation mit ihm gar nicht erst zu beginnen. Der besagte Kommentar, in dem er meine Erklärung eine Lügengeschichte nennt, mir selektive Zensur vorwirft und mich beschuldigt im Nachinein eine Geschichte erfunden zu haben um meine Missetaten zu verschleiern steht übrigens nach wie vor für alle sichtbar im thread und ist nicht ""zensiert"" worden, aber das nur am Rande.


**Zu den Vorwürfen:**

&gt; Wie kommt es dazu, dass ausschließlich die beiden Posts gelöscht wurden, nicht aber alle anderen auch bzw. nur der Account gebannt wurde, die Posts aber allumfänglich stehen bleiben?

Moderatoren sind überhaupt nicht in der Lage Postings oder Kommentare zu ""löschen"". Wir können sie nur aus unserem subreddit ""entfernen"". Ein entfernter Kommentar wird lediglich im entsprechenden subreddit nicht mehr angezeigt. Besucht man die Profilseite des users kann man dort sämtliche Kommentare wieder vorfinden (auch die in einem spezifischen subreddit entfernten). 

Ich habe nur zwei seiner Kommentare entfernt da ich diese geöffnet hatte im Moment als ich mich für den ban entschieden hatte. Durch die gesamte history eines users zu gehen um jeden einzelnen Kommentar zu entfernen scheint mir etwas exzessiv und es ist auch unnötig.

&gt; Wieso wurde /u/100prozentafd erst Stunden später nach der 2ten Löschung -die erste kann ja bis zu 10 Tage her sein- und nicht sofort gebannt?

Laut modlog habe ich um 7:19 Uhr den entsprechenden Kommentar entfernt und den Nutzer bei automoderator zum bannen eingetragen. Ebenfalls um 7:19 habe ich den ""update"" Befehl an automod geschickt um den ban zu aktivieren. Obwohl alle Einträge richtig waren hat automod den ban jedoch nicht ausgeführt was ich nur zufällig und auch erst viele Stunden später bemerkt habe. Meine erste Vermutung für den fehlgeschlagenen ban war den ""update"" Befehl vergessen zu haben, deshalb habe ich erneut ein ""update"" an automoderator geschickt. Erst als der ban danach noch immer nicht funktioniert hat habe ich kapiert dass der Fehler bei automod liegt und den ban manuell ausgeführt.

Aaaaaalso. 
Zum Thema Mauerfall: Mein Vater kommt aus Thüringen, und 'durfte' seit '71 die DDR miterleben. Unter anderem wurde ihm von der Stasi untersagt zu studieren, da er wohl als gefährlich eingestuft wurde. Ohne den Mauerfall gäbe es mich gar nicht, meine Eltern haben sich im wiedervereinten Berlin in den 90ern kennengelernt, also ist es auch irgendwie ein Grund zum Feiern. 

Die Woche über ist sonst nichts weiter passiert, der übliche Kram in der Schule.
Heute war von 12-19 Uhr LAN-Party, 4 Kumpels kamen und wir haben zusammen Age of Empires II gezockt. Leider ist das Spiel kurz vor der gigantischen Endschlacht abgestürzt. :(

Morgen zum Glück die ersten zwei Stunden Entfall, heißt einigermaßen ausschlafen. Das Wochenende ging (wie immer) viel zu schnell herum.
Liebe Grüße vom O-Saft!
