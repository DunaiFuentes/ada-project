I feel like we would have a more politically active society if we started teaching about the political system earlier, like maybe in 7th or 8th grade.

Io un pensiero comunque ce lo farei (la letteratura e i giornali non sono male). 

Poi, ci sarebbe l'Asia - lo scoglio enorme e' che per le lingue piu' diffuse (Cinese e Giapponese) occorre memorizzare migliaia di caratteri prima di poter leggere un giornale. Per altre (tipo il Coreano) non c'e' questo problema, ma la diffusione e' molto ma molto piu' ridotta.

In sostanza: scegli un paese di cui ti interessa la cultura, e buttati!
Il modo migliore e' trovare il modo di fare un corso di base in qualche scuola (I centri culturali e i centri linguistici interdipartimentali delle universita' spesso offrono qualcosa a prezzo ragionevole).

A proposito, anche se il primo anno in genere e' un casino, INFORMATI SUBITO se l'universita' che frequenti ha un centro linguistico, e ISCRIVITI a un paio di lingue: inglese + una seconda lingua. L'inglese serve per acquisire la padronanza che ti sara' necessaria - se diventi presidente del consiglio - per evitare figure alla Renzi. 

In genere, l'impegno e' solo qualche ora alla settimana, i docenti sono madrelingua e la preparazione che ti danno e' eccellente.

As Portugal followed Spain's policies on ""green electricity"" almost by the letter, I don't know if the all the effects are the same, but what you described in the OC already happened here -- with the difference Portugal didn't stop this insane run to disaster.

Other effects: some of the highest tariffs on electricity in Europe AND a running public debt to the power companies (the price for MWh is now so high they were scared to reflect that entirely on consumer prices -- yet). And they still subsidize new dams and windmills to produce energy NOBODY WANTS but IS STILL FULLY paid by the consumer -- BY LAW.

Worse, the most insulting is the subsidies to gas and coal powerplants that only exist to provide backup power (you know, wind isn't always blowing, the sun sets at night...). None of this was required by the consumers (industry, people at home...).

I guess this is what happens when communism meets capitalism and have a lovechild: a policy with the drawbacks of both.

One way to recover this thoughtless investment would be to export excess electricity, right? Well, guess what: the only country that we could export too invested in exactly the same energy sources, and when we have excess they have too. So, Portugal is only allowed to export electricity AT ZERO COST.

And an option to become TW had nothing to do with getting the passport (on regular basis), and certainly - not in this case, since Boni himself has disclosed his personal motivations that stood behind his decision to become a TW, when he acknowledged that fact publicly in 2007 only because he wanted to become the minister, and only because that was the pre-requirement for him to get that position in the government.

And last, but not least - he haven't got bitchslapped because he was a TW.

As I've said earlier, in one of the posts, below - he got bitchslapped, because he was name calling other people, while lying about his true status of TW in the 90s and he didn't apologize for it ever since.

&gt;My point is that this subject is much more complex than you seem to realise (or want to realise, rather) and simply being TW proves hardly anything. I've seen files of TWs heroic beyond reason and ones with common scum. 

Indeed. He was a very heroic man, being afraid to tell his wife that he cheated on her - he has chosen to become TW, instead. A true hero of the day ;)

&gt;

&gt;The __Tower of Hanoi__ (also called the __Tower of Brahma__ or __Lucas' Tower__,  and sometimes pluralized) is a [mathematical game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_game) or [puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle). It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

&gt;The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

&gt;


&gt;* Only one disk can be moved at a time.

&gt;* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.

&gt;* No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

&gt;With three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves. The minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2^*n* - 1, where *n* is the number of disks.

true,MoreGott,,,"Leaking and spying are two different things, at least in this context.

Leaking in your post is, revealing the illegal things a nation does to everyone else on this planet (even to  the own citizens) to the press. To show what your government is doing. Like: listening in on *every* conversation, even without a real warrant (US warrants don't mean shit in other nations). Leaking is  something you do, when your government is spiraling out of control - as the US is doing since 9/11. When your government is committing crimes you actually should speak up because there is something wrong.

While spying on another nation is completely different. Spying is a more or less legitimate business against another nation. Spying means getting information from one source for your country. It's ""just"" about being informed.

In Japanese, ""You must not do X"" (""doing X is not allowed"") is said *~te wa dame da,"" which is literally ""doing X is bad"" or ""~te wa ikenai/naranai"" which is close to ""doing X cannot happen/should not happen/must not happen.""

""You don't have to do X"" is *~nakute mo ii*. Literally ""not doing X is OK, too.""

So maybe clear up the ambiguity of the latter by not using *mussen*, but rather just saying *you can do X or not X*. Not sure if this is OK, but maybe *Du hast nicht zu ~*?

I'm not saying they are our enemy or anything, and we are probably less antagonistic with them than we are with France, but they are still not the Anglosphere.  As far as Canada, they are our next door neighbor, and we can barely tell each other apart.  Since you bring up WWII, we were on the same side as the Anglosphere, obviously.  As far as culture, we do not share the same language with Germany, and we do share language and the common law system with the rest of the Anglosphere.

I have nothing against Germany, I'm happy that we were so supportive of them.  No country has ever owned up to their wrongs, and made things right like Germany has.  

However, the US is seriously overextending itself, and I don't want to see us implode.  I 100% trust Germany, and want to see them at the center of Europe as its leader.  I also think that the UK will opt out of the EU, and this will further increase the need for Germany to play a larger role in it.

The cold war is over, Germany does not need us to protect them from the USSR.  Germany is technologically advanced and has a large arms industry, it can defend itself, should it choose to.  Germany could also serve as an arbiter between Russia and the US.  

A more multipolar world is good for everyone, and that is what I want.  Why should we have troops in Europe at this point?  It's insane.  We can't artificially suppress the importance of Germany any more.  I trust them with a powerful military, which should reflect their economic power.

We should still be allies of course, but the key to a strong and independent EU is one with a strong Germany and an intergrated military structure outside of NATO.  I'd like to see a strong continental armed force in alliance with an Anglosphere force.

WWII is over, the Cold War is over.  It is time for Germany to live up to its potential, we can trust them to do this without being unduly belligerent or aggressive.

Do you recall how Americans voiced their displeasure when France and Germany didn't want to play ball? The Freedom Fries thing was just odd, but pouring wine down the gutter should be a crime.

This even was official US policy, after Condi's advice: ""Punish France, ignore Germany, forgive Russia."" Or do you remember Rumsfeld's ""Old Europe"" comments?

I'm old enough to remember those times rather well, and believe me, that decision was entirely domestic (you could even say it was Schröder's pre-election populism). Schröder had ruled out a German participation in Iraq months before Chirac did, and before even the last relevant UN resolution to pressure Hussein into re-allowing UN inspectors was decided with Russian support. You can read an interesting interview he gave the NY Times back then [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/04/international/europe/05GERM-TEXT.html?pagewanted=all). Note what he says about the need to stabilize Afghanistan, the lack of plans for a post-Saddam Iraq and the region, and his doubt about the ""evidence"".

There is a lot to be criticized regarding Schröder's relationship with Putin, particularly after his term in office, but there's actually a long tradition of Russo-German ""pal diplomacy"" going back to Kohl and Gorbachev that used to work rather well. This doesn't mean that Germany is somehow responsible for Russia's politics, so I don't know what you're getting at with the Fannie Mae thing. Destabilizing the US economy further wouldn't have been in Germany's interest, to the contrary, the contagion effects were bad enough as they were.

Ben pas tant que ça. Parce que pour le calcul de tes bénéfices, et pas de ton CA, plein de choses entrent en jeu. Et parce que la fiscalité française est un immense bordel.

I have known two guys that were in Dutchbat and they were both sick of war and full of remorse of what happened. Young folks then, oblivious. It wasn't even their fault. 
Not to think about all of the civilians that went trough hell and worse. And its happening in other places as we speak. Earth is such a weird place. Sitting here with my morning coffee in complete peace complaining about taxes.

I hope my children will live to see the day when there is no war. I don't know how to explain to her why ""we"" do what we do as a human species. 

*edit* The Dutch *Troops*, I think, are not to be blamed much. They came for humanitarian reasons, without proper weapons to defend everyone, they weren't supposed to, and weren't ready to fight, they were kept in the dark and were mostly young guys without a clue. It was a clusterfuck.  If there were subtitles I would post a link to a documentary where the ex Dutchbatters were being interviewed and it's really eye opening.

Then resign.  One of the benefits of being a simple employee is that it's easy to quit and choose a new job.  There's no risk there.

That's a ""risk""?  Seriously?

None of these are really risks related to taking a job.  They're simply inconveniences that happen in life.  Sometimes you don't like your neighbors.  Sometimes you don't like your co-workers.  Sometimes you have other priorities in life.

Working for someone else who is taking the business-related risks reduces these.  If you don't like the job, or something better comes along you can easily quit.  If you'd prefer to spend more time with your family, you can ask for reduced hours or quit.  If you don't like your boss, you can quit.  Having nothing invested in the business means that it's really easy just to walk away.

true,DragonFly441,BAWU,Baden,"**TL DR: Dont ask reddit, hire a German lawyer that has some experience in the matter. Your friend has the cash!**

What has this to do with a ""good"" policeforce? At least try to make a reasonable title.

Since your friend makes money with his instagramm it is maybe easier to go to them in order to try to get the account back? I mean he should have given them some private information so that he can prove that he is the legitimate owner. Criminal investigations take their time and even if your friend gets the account back it might be worthless by then.

Hacking private accounts is a criminal offence in Germany. Since you know the Bundesland the alleged hacker lives you can lay a charge againt the person if you know the name and address or ""unknown"" (Having an IP adress may help) with the police or Staatsanwaltschaft in the corresponding Bundesland. You can do that online or via Mail. I would advise calling them and asking about you specific problem, they can give you more detailed information. Also if your friend can't really prove that it is really his account (indicated by the fact that he is unable to convince instagram that it was hacked) there is nothing the police can do. Also since you seem to have to idea about how to procede talk to a lawyer!

**Will they investigate?** Since it seems to be about financial gain they probably will.

**Will they help your friend directly?** NO, of course not. I would be a criminal investigation of the matter. However if the hacker is found guilty your friend could get his account back afterwards in a civil lawsuit or even more likely the person who stole the account would prefer to just give it back to show good will in a police investigation.

**What are the chances of success?** Hard to evaluate. Instagram is a US company, if they don't provide personal information to German authorities there is nothing the police can do really. Just on your accusation that IP adress X hacked an account that may or may not belong to your friend it is unlikely that any German judge would allow an identification of the person behind the IP address.

**Will it take forever?** Yep, a couple of months at least. So you should probably investigate alternative actions. ",0,1405153272,null,0,1405153846,0,cival6i,t3_2ahgdf,t1_cival6i,t1_civ6kul,null,1434677555,5,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,5

Se non superi una lezione, beh, è solo perché non conosci quanto dovresti, e alla fine significa che è utile come app! Duolingo anche offre altri sussidi (tabelle riassuntive, etc.), soprattutto se accedi dal Web.

Io l'ho trovato ottimo come primo approccio (al tedesco e al portoghese).

Ci sono altri metodi: il Pimsleur, ad esempio, ma per me era troppo lento; altri l'hanno trovato utile. Memrise è un altro app, LiveMocha è un altro sito, anche il BBC offre dei corsi online.

Ci sono dei [corsi del USA Foreign Service Institute](http://www.fsi-language-courses.org/Content.php), creati per i dipendenti statiunitensi che devono trasferirsi all'estero per motivi diplomatici.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; I'll give a more complete response tomorrow,

When you do, try not to frame it as us being best buddies with Russia and you therefore distrust us, because that's bullshit.

Yes, Germany has better relations with Russia (or China, for that matter) than the US. Maybe that we don't believe in ""Evil Empires"" has something to do with it, but it's really based on necessity and geography (whether or not some at the edge of the US' cold and vast emptiness can see some of Russia's from their house). For better or worse, we're almost neighbors. Our histories have been entangled for centuries, and always will be. The US can give Russia the silent treatment, but we need to have a good line of communication. They'll never share our values if there's no economic, cultural and political contact, and another Cold War is in nobody's interest, with the possible exception of certain US conservatives who need an antagonist to rally against.

That we have an interest in developing a constructive relationship with Russia, as opposed to excluding it, doesn't mean we cooperate with them against the US. If you suspect another Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in the making, then you're out of your mind.  
You seem to remember Schröder's relationship with Putin quite well, and yes, in retrospect the ""flawless democrat"" comment seems a bit off. But do you also remember how Bush ""looked into Putin's soul"" and say a ""good guy""? Or how silly those two looked in their ponchos on his ranch in Crawford?

You correctly talk about how things changed when Putin ""came back to power"" (as if he ever left). Things looked really promising initially when there was a lot of progress in Russia. It only properly went downhill when their economy stalled and Putin became increasingly nationalistic and populist. This affected Russo-German relations as well. Merkel's relations with Putin never were anywhere near as good as they used to be under Schröder. 

So, stop pretending that the NSA's and CIA's operations in Germany are some sort of reaction to a perceived Russo-German alliance, because that's ridiculous and only makes it look as if you're either delusional or making excuses. Besides, some of the US' Middle Eastern buddies are far from examples of liberal democracies.

Guess what, Frau Diener: Sowas passiert dauernd bei Bereichen, die gefühlt ein Quasi-Monopol haben.

Fragen Sie mal einen Zugschaffner oder einen an der Hotline von Paketdiensten, was die sich dauernd anhören müssen. Auch schon vor dem www. Doch von der Pressestelle der Bahn hört man komischerweise selten ""Wir haben so viele Hater...... mimimi"". Bei Zeitungen hört man das oft.

No we actually can't. They're a foreign power we, the Poles, can't control or appeal to disband - we can at least rebel against the local government.

&gt;So far every big investment made by the polish government was just in order to steal money.

New highways, airports, buses, libraries, renovation of trains, wind farms on Pomerania, free internet access... all to steal money? Sure, there's ridiculously high corruption, but the projects succeeded despite it, and weren't implemented because of it.

&gt;Poland is too small and too poor to have any real space program.

This does not mean 'sending a man to Mars', but 'sending research satellites', coordinating IT and media efforts, financing and funding research on new materials, robotics and radioactivity. Polish science is in a deep shithole, and maybe this could help it out.

The reason why we don't have atomic power plants, for instance, is not so simple as ""them evil gubmint people cheated us"", there's popular dissatisfaction, foreign relations, infrastructure problem, dependence on imported uranium.

It said that as long as USSR existed, and financed far-left groups across the world, right-wing capitalism tried to be more or less associated with democratic principles, and tried to undermine far-left support by indulging in far more social welfare measures than they would naturally do.

Since 1991, however, every welfare program is seen as a leftist thing. Fighting the inequalities (which used to be a right-wing value!), fighting monopolies are not considered right-wing values anymore. They don't have to fight a push or a pull from a worldwide villain anymore.

Can Putin's Russia have a similar role? If so, it won't be as a communist state. We can debate over that, but most of Putin's values echo far-right values. Religion, anti-foreigners, anti-gays, pan-nationalism, enforced morality... 

So how would it work? Would it exert a push or a pull pressure? Will right-wing parties benefit or suffer from a proximity to Russia's strong man's ideas? I have no idea.

There's latent tension between the U.S. and quite a few other states, some of which still possess nuclear weaponry. But generally speaking nuclear weapons don't factor into this because it's the cold war situation all over again, nuke Germany and someone else is going to take revenge, and the one who placed the first nuke is the one whom everyone else is going to see as the bad guy. If the U.S. conveniently presents itself as the bad guy, its allies not going to support it when it comes to fighting off its enemies. Those enemies know that, and might wage war against the U.S.
I'm not saying that a war against the U.S. as a whole is going to happen (that is actually really unrealistic, but you've already mentioned some of the - mostly economic - reasons why that isn't going to happen).
But what could happen is that the demand that the current government of the U.S. is dissolved arises, because it's obviously incapable of controlling itself and its foreign policy isn't acceptable. And if that happens, there could be an (arguably relatively short) period where conflict between U.S. armed forces and foreign armies is inevitable because of the U.S. government trying to protect itself.

Non è proprio così. Ci sono informazioni che ha senso rendere pubbliche nel momento in cui accadono, ma non a distanza di anni. Ipotizziamo il caso di Tizio, che a 18 anni viene beccato a rubare un motorino. Giustamente la cronaca locale sbatte la notizia in prima pagina (con i commenti dei vicini: ""sembrava un bravo ragazzo"", etc). Per quanto tempo Tizio dovrà essere continuare a scontare pubblicamente questo errore? Sarebbe accettabile che la notizia venisse ripubblicata dopo un mese? Un anno? Dieci anni? Venti?

Il ""diritto all'oblio"" esiste da sempre. Quando è passato molto tempo dai fatti non ha più senso continuare a rendere pubblica la notizia, perchè l'interesse pubblico è venuto meno. Se il giornalista ripubblica dopo dieci anni la notizia di Tizio che ha rubato il motorino, non si tratta più di diritto di cronaca, si tratta diffamazione pura e semplice. Ovviamente l'interesse pubblico alla notizia può talvolta anche ritornare (Tizio dopo venti anni si butta in politica: hanno diritto i suoi elettori ad essere informati del furto compiuto a 18 anni? Direi di sì).

Tutto questo meccanismo si complica con la diffusione della rete: il giornale pubblica la notizia oggi e Google la indicizza. Il giornale non ripubblica più niente, ma tutte le volte che qualcuno cerca in rete  il nome di Tizio ricompare la vecchia storia del motorino. Agli effetti pratici, è come se la notizia venisse ripubblicata quotidianamente.

Fin qui abbiamo fatto l'ipotesi di un reato,  ma non è detto che la notizia debba essere riferita ad un illecito. Nel caso deciso dalla Corte di Giustizia si trattava di un individuo che aveva subito la messa in vendita di un immobile, a causa di un debito che era poi riuscito a saldare. Ora immagina che per il resto della tua vita il tuo nome rimanga collegato ad un episodio in cui non hai avuto temporaneamente la liquidità per saldare un debito. Per quanti anni è accettabile che questo collegamento venga mantenuto vivo? Dopo quanto tempo comincia a diventare un'ingiustizia?

Was mir auffällt, ist, dass manche Journalisten nun nach dem Begriff ""Shitstorm"" auch den Begriff ""Troll"" entdeckt haben und ihn benutzen, um ihren Frust da reinpacken. Kritik? Troll. Das sind ""Neuland""-Phänomene, aber auf beiden Seiten. Die Abwesendheit des Gesichts des Gegenüber verleitet manchen dazu, verletzend zu werden, ohne es zu merken, bzw weit über's Ziel hinauszuschiessen. Schliesslich sind auch Leser von den teils seltsamen Ansichten der Journalisten frustriert und sehen sich zudem auch noch in einer meinungstechnischen Ohnmachtsposition.

&gt;None of these are really risks related to taking a job.

Yes they are. Work isn't like social life, there is a hierarchy, a work procedure, tasks imposed on you that you have little say in at most workplaces. It can be much more stressful than your otherwise daily life. Work and health have been very closely linked for a long time.

&gt;If you don't like the job, or something better comes along you can easily quit. If you'd prefer to spend more time with your family, you can ask for reduced hours or quit. If you don't like your boss, you can quit. Having nothing invested in the business means that it's really easy just to walk away.

That is the arrogance of the city dwellers towards country people. In my area there are thousands of hectares of abandoned land. And the problem is not only the ""non-natives"", even native vegetation of brambles, medronho and cork oaks will grow into an impenetrable mass of dry combustible material 5 to 10 meters high. A single spark of a work tool hitting a stone is enough to start an inferno (I have seen it often enough). Of course, the police has to investigate neglect and, of course, rumors will spread and the media will speculate. But the fact is that, of the hundreds (or even thousands) of wild fires taking place every year, only a small proportion is deliberate. With your figure of 90%, there would have to be tens of thousands of convicted arsonists in Portugal. The only thing that is surprising is that more fires don't happen. On the other hand, there is no way you can burn a plowed field. Thus, the cause for the wildfires is the ""abandoned land"" and not criminal intent.

I have lived in a rammed earth building for nearly 20 years and practice self-sufficiency as far as possible. I also know that the locals ridiculed me and my friends when we started using traditional methods 30 years ago. There are now organisations like Taipa trying to promote traditional methods, still most locals even today prefer to bulldoze their ruinas to put up a concrete building. That is the fact I was trying to explain in a few words and I don't in the least appreciate your ad hominem. If I wanted to denigrate your people I could come up with other stories.

Anyways, you didn't understand the essential, namely, that it is one thing to romanticize about the simple life and another to practice it. Media stories like those about the German in Greece only give a very imperfect impression. Your aggressive response indicates that you aren't even capable of discussing the issue, let alone accept actual experience.

Well, unfortunately it doesn't. It's been empirically proven that it doesn't. Things like the pay gap and the glass ceiling aren't just buzzwords.

[For example:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_inequality#Professional_education_and_careers)
,,A recent study in the USA demonstrated that when leaders at scientific research institutes were presented with otherwise identical job applications (a randomized double-blind designed with n=127) with either female or male names, faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The tendency to be biased towards the male application was expressed by both male and female faculty staff.""

&gt; I have this[1] study about sexual behavior, clearly showing that (the majority of) women prefer to be submissive in the bedroom.

That's a pretty weak analogy.

&gt; Because it often gives minorities unequal representation.
 If a few percent of the population have secured seats in parliament, it can easily lead to them having a stronger voice than they should and making decisions that are not beneficial to the majority. 

If the quota is set up properly, the proportion of their seats will be the same as their proportion in the overall population.

The pay gap, as in women are paid less for the same work, doesn't really exist.  
It's caused simply by women making different choices than men, like working less overtime and such.

Yes, but others of their minority can be elected into other seats as well, causing an imbalance.

I would not mention that you are looking for this kind of relationship up front, as airbnb has a policy about not soliciting arrangements outside the site (which is a good policy and you should be scam-wary of anyone who approaches you directly offering to rent outside of airbnb). Just say you are interested in a few months' rental and bring up the idea after you have already messaged back and forth a bit and established a minimal level of trust. However, people will likely be open to doing it this way because it allows you both to avoid airbnb's fees, which really add up unnecessarily for long-term arrangements.

Agreed, but it really would be wise to let things cool off for a few days and negotiate behind the scenes. If it escalates any further Washington will just go into siege mode and lock down and then the pressure becomes exponentially counter productive.

By the way, the nationalism flaring on this topic is absolutely insane. You have one guy at the top saying we should wage covert diplomatic warfare to bring down the US so that Germany can ascend to it's rightful place as the world's top power and you have another guy advocating total war with the US over spying. =| WTF  This type of reaction makes me question whether Germany is a friend to be respected or whether the CIA was on to something.

Les industries créatives sont aussi de formidables mobilisatrices d'investissements. Je m'apprête à écrire au Président d'Orange une lettre de mission lui demandant d'être le vaisseau amiral porteur de notre révolution numérique et souveraine.

Son but est de contrer netflix, probablement en facilitant des liens Orange-dailymotion. Il voit ça comme une offensive culturelle.

L'hybridation public-privé n'est pas mon premier choix dans les modèles de financement de la culture par internet, mais ça reste largement préférable au choix par défaut de faire dans le tout répressif en espérant qu'internet et bittorrent finiront par s'en aller.

Je trouve ses choix intéressants. De fait, il y a une hégémonie américaine sur de nombreux catalogues culturels. Les entreprises françaises ne sont pas de taille à négocier avec les syndicats d'ayant-droits américains. Du coup que l'état pèse de son poids dans la balance pour aider à consolider tout ça peut avoir du sens.

Franchement, je trouve que pour un fois qu'un ministre tente des trucs qui sortent un peu de l'orthodoxie, c'est dommage de lui faire des critiques automatiques. S'il a un truc sur dix qui marche, il aura fait plus avancer les choses que tous ses prédécesseurs.

 * The way the UN ignored the cries of the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Serb army every single time this happened.

I shouldn't have to say that I don't condone killing -- *no matter what the reason* -- but it's not farfetched to see how a group (The Scorpions, in this case) would take things into their own hands after a while, and do the things they did in Srebrenica.

Also, some people on here don't seem to understand how gender quotas work. Very rarely do they mean that lesser qualified people get the job. What they mean is that amongst two equally qualified people the woman/man (depending on the workplace) will get the job (the argument being that their gender is an extra qualification in itself in adding diversity to the workplace).

&gt;

&gt;The version history of the [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system\)) [mobile operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system) began with the release of the Android [beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_(software\)) in November 2007. The first commercial version, Android 1.0, was released in September 2008. Android is under ongoing development by [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) and the [Open Handset Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Handset_Alliance) (OHA), and has seen a number of [updates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing\)) to its base operating system since its initial release.

&gt;Since April 2009, Android versions have been developed under a [confectionery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confectionery)-themed [code name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_name) and released in alphabetical order; the exceptions are versions 1.0 and 1.1:

&gt;


&gt;* Android alpha (1.0)

&gt;* Android beta (1.1)

&gt;* Cupcake (1.5)

&gt;* Doughnut (1.6)

&gt;* Eclair (2.0–2.1)

&gt;* Froyo (2.2–2.2.3)

&gt;* Gingerbread (2.3–2.3.7)

&gt;* Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0–4.0.4)

&gt;* Jelly Bean (4.1–4.3.1)

&gt;* KitKat (4.4–4.4.4)

&gt;* [""L"" release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_L) (developer preview)

&gt;On September 3, 2013, Google announced that 1 billion activated devices now use the Android OS worldwide.  The most recent major Android update was KitKat 4.4, which was released to commercial devices on November 22, 2013, via an [OTA update](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-air_programming).

true,moviemaniac226,UNSA,United States of America,"I've been reading parts of Naomi Klein's *The Shock Doctrine* recently, and she has a chapter devoted to Russia that does a great job explaining the context of the 1990s and how people like Putin were able to rise to power. Sorry for the long excerpt, but I think this should be kept in mind when we're considering the transition Russia is going through right now:

&gt; By the beginning of the nineties, with his twin policies of glasnost (open- ness) and perestroika (restructuring), Gorbachev had led the Soviet Union through a remarkable process of democratization: the press had been freed, Russia’s parliament, local councils, president and vice president had been elected, and the constitutional court was independent. As for the economy, Gorbachev was moving toward a mixture of a free market and a strong safety net, with key industries under public control —a process he predicted would take ten to fifteen years to be completed. His end goal was to build social democracy on the Scandinavian model, “a socialist beacon for all mankind.”

&gt;    At first it seemed that the West also wanted Gorbachev to succeed in loosening up the Soviet economy and transforming it into something close to Sweden’s. The Nobel Committee explicitly described the prize as a way of offering support to the transition—“a helping hand in an hour of need.” And on a visit to Prague, Gorbachev made it clear that he couldn’t do it all alone: “Like mountain climbers on one rope, the world’s nations can either climb together to the summit or fall together into the abyss,” he said.

&gt;    So what happened at the G7 meeting in 1991 was totally unexpected. The nearly unanimous message that Gorbachev received from his fellow heads of state was that, if he did not embrace radical economic shock therapy immediately, they would sever the rope and let him fall. “Their suggestions as to the tempo and methods of transition were astonishing,” Gorbachev wrote of the event.

 &gt;   Poland had just completed its first round of shock therapy under the JMF’s and Jeffrey Sachs’s tutelage, and the consensus among British prime minister John Major, U.S. president George H. W. Bush, Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney and Japanese prime minister Toshiki Kaifu was that the Soviet Union had to follow Poland’s lead on an even faster timetable. After the meeting, Gorbachev got the same marching orders from the IMF, the World Bank and every other major lending institution. Later that year, when Russia asked for debt forgiveness to weather a catastrophic economic crisis, the stern answer was that the debts had to be honored.’ Since the time when Sachs had marshaled aid and debt relief for Poland, the political mood had changed—it was meaner.

&gt;    What happened next—the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev’s eclipse by Yeltsin, and the tumultuous course of economic shock therapy in Russia—is a well-documented chapter of contemporary history. It is, however, a story too often told in the bland language of “reform,” a narrative so generic that it has hidden one of the greatest crimes committed against a democracy in modern history. Russia, like China, was forced to choose between a Chicago School economic program and an authentic democratic revolution. Faced with that choice, China’s leaders had attacked their own people in order to prevent democracy from disturbing their free-market plans. Russia was different: the democratic revolution was, already well under way—in order to push through a Chicago School economic program, that peaceful and hopeful process that Gorbachev began had to be violently interrupted, then radically reversed.

&gt; Gorbachev soon found himself facing an adversary who was more than willing to play the role of a Russian Pinochet. Boris Yeltsin, though holding the post of Russian president, had a much lower profile than Gorbachev, who headed all the Soviet Union. That was to change dramatically on August 19, 1991, one month after the G7 Summit. A group from the Communist old guard drove tanks up to the White House, as the Russian parliament building is called. In a bid to halt the democratization process, they threatened to attack…

Since then, Russia's standard of living has plummeted, life expectancy has dropped by over 10 years, and alcoholism and drug use is an epidemic. Given where the country is now, it's incredibly sad to think that the world and the Russian people could've had a Russia closer to Sweden or Norway had Gorbachev gotten his way.

It looked like big issues with Russia were winding down, and that China was gearing up to take Russia's place as our new rival. Even though Russia had been acting more ""antagonist"" it mostly just struck most of the people in the US as a performance for the Russian population, not anything too serious. True, Georgia was a setback, but we've got pretty short term memory here.

The invasion of Ukraine basically put all of those ideas to rest. All of the hawks who couldn't let go of the Cold War got to say ""I told you so!"" and it was seen as a return to form for Russia. All the progress we had made was just a fluke, so people got annoyed.

In Sweden we have something known as the autonomous left. This is a sort of umbrella term incorporating everything from your average anarchist to fascistoid non-democratic radical movements like the ""Revolutionary front"" and the ""Antifascistic Action"", organisations (for lack of a better term) whose political activism includes assaults, vandalism and death threats.
  
What worries me is that while right wing extremists are rightfully politically marginalized, there seem to exist a sort of tacit approval of the left wing radicals among some mainstream left wing politicians and journalists (who are disproportionally left leaning themselves, compared to the population as a whole). Even if they dont agree with the methods it often gets rationalized through the good ol ""its for a good cause"". This has had some interesting results on the public discourse, in my opinion overplaying the threat of neo nazis and their ilk, while often waffling on the subject of left wing extremism.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"For those who don't know, the 12th July is a Loyalist day of celebration in the North of Ireland. It commemorates the defeat of Jacobite forces at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.

This battle, while militarily indecisive, was the major turning point in the war. 

The Jacobites were a largely Irish, Catholic force, allied with the French, that were fighting against the Dutch Stadtholder, William of Orange, who had crossed the English channel at the invitation of the British parliament in order to depose King James, whom they disliked for his Catholicism. 

Prior to the battle, in 1689, the Catholic parliament in Dublin passed a law that; ""all religions were equal, and that each clergyman should be supported by his own congregation only, and that no tithes should be levied upon any man for the support of a church to which he did not belong""

Despite William's own, somewhat secular approach, he never secured rights for Catholics within the Kingdoms, and invariably lead to the creation of the Orangemen, a strongly anti-Catholic, Protestant movement known today as the Orange Order.

For those who do not know who James Connolly is, he was a Marxist revolutionary who fought for worker's rights in Ireland. He founded the Irish Citizen's Army, which protected Trade Unions from businesses while they were on strike, and which also took part in the Easter Rising in Dublin, 1916, along with 6 other Republican leaders. 

Taking a bullet to the leg during the Rising, James Connolly was propped up into a chair and executed by British [firing squad](http://youtu.be/QKjCrYqvkv8?t=1m7s) on 12th May, 1916.

Connolly is still widely remembered today. This post was a paper he wrote in 1913 in regards to his feeling towards 12th July as a day of celebration and the events behind it.",0,1405179503,null,0,1405179878,0,civgjd1,t3_2aij8u,t1_civgjd1,t3_2aij8u,null,1434680428,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Kit_Emmuorto,vaticano,,"&gt; Dice radio palazzo che la riforma Boschi-Finocchiaro-Calderoli per passare a Palazzo Madama ora ha bisogno del voto palese

No. Non ne ha mai avuto bisogno e non ne avrà perché è normale che su queste cose come sul 99% delle altre si vada a voto palese. La faccenda del voto segreto è uscita stamattina sui giornali - che poi è dove l'ha letta il coglione, solo che dire ""radio palazzo"" fa più figo - perché l'hanno messa in giro i vari Minzolini e Mineo perché così pensano di far cacare sotto Pd e Forza Italia, ma lo sanno pure loro che, anche se venisse fuori qualcuno a chiederlo, il voto segreto non sarebbe mai dato

&gt; perche il voto segreto di per sé è una schifezza

No. Il voto segreto è il massimo strumento di tutela della libertà individuale del parlamentare. Esiste proprio perché non deve essere possibile ai boss - come li chiama il coglione - imporre con la forza a nessuno come votare. Soprattutto, esiste perché serve a garantire attuazione ad una mezza dozzina di articoli della famosa Costituzione più bella del mondo, alla cui difesa il coglione pure dice di tenere parecchio

&gt; È ciò che succede, appunto, in un Parlamento di nominati: quando i parlamentari sentono di non rispondere più ai loro elettori, ma al loro leader

No. Questa affermazione è completamente senza senso. Cioè, se fossero stati eletti con le preferenze boccerebbero la riforma del Senato perché così chiede il loro elettorato? E in base a cosa stabiliamo che l'elettorato sia contrario a che i propri rappresentanti votino una riforma che al momento delle elezioni nemmeno esisteva? Ma di che cazzo stiamo parlando? Va bene che il coglione cede al riflesso pavloviano per cui ogni volta che si deve parlare male dei parlamentari bisogna dire che fanno schifo perché la vergogna delle liste bloccate, ma in questo caso ha persino meno senso del solito

&gt; in quanto scelti dai partiti, i parlamentari non possono esprimersi pubblicamente contro un futuro Parlamento anch’esso scelto dai partiti

No. A parte che il Senato non è il Parlamento (ma capisco di stare operando sottigliezze un po' ostiche per il coglione), e poi scelto dai partiti un paio di ciufoli. Il testo attuale della riforma prevede elezione da parte dei consigli regionali: significa che a) i partiti non fanno liste per il Senato; b) che diventano senatori persone già elette alle amministrative con le preferenze.

2) The law on bloggers having to register with the Russian version of the FCC is actually an amendment of a previous law already in existence.

true,Seefor,DENK,Copenhagen,"Well, despite the Scandinavian languages being mutually intelligible, us Danes have chosen a completely different number system than the others. Everything up till 20 is the same, but from then on things get weird. It's actually similar to the French number system and it causes a lot of headaches for our Scandinavian brother peoples, who usually just give up learning our numbers. See for example [this Norwegian video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrGIhrs3HkI) mocking the difficulty of Danish numbers (Turn on captions for English subs).

From Wiki:

&gt; In the word forms of numbers above 20, the units are stated before the tens, such that 21 is rendered enogtyve, literally ""one and twenty"". Similar constructions are found in German, Dutch, Afrikaans, certain varieties of Norwegian, Slovene and Arabic as well as in archaic and dialect English (compare the line ""Four-and-twenty blackbirds"" in the old nursery rhyme.)...

&gt; ...One peculiar feature of the Danish language is the fact that numerals 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 are (somewhat like the French numerals from 80 through 99) based on a vigesimal system, formerly also used in Norwegian and Swedish. This means that the score is used as a base unit in counting: Tres (short for tre-sinds-tyve meaning ""three times twenty"") means sixty, while halvtreds (short for halvtredje-sinds-tyve meaning ""half third times twenty"", implying two score plus half of the third score) is fifty. The ending sindstyve meaning ""times twenty"" is no longer included in cardinal numbers, but still used in ordinal numbers. Thus, in modern Danish fifty-two is usually rendered as tooghalvtreds from the now obsolete tooghalvtredsindstyve, whereas 52nd is either tooghalvtredsende or tooghalvtredsindstyvende. Twenty is called tyve (derived from old Danish tiughu, a haplology of tuttiughu, meaning 'two tens'[14]), while thirty is tredive (derived from old Danish þrjatiughu meaning 'three tens'), and forty is called fyrre (derived from the old Danish fyritiughu meaning 'four tens'[15] via fyrretyve, still occasionally used in historical settings or for humorous effect). An exception to the way Danish numbers are formed is in writing cheques and legal amounts in banking, where traditionally the numbers are 10-based and spelled as they appear in numerical form; thus, fir(e)ti is forty (4 times 10) and seksti-to is sixty-two (6 times 10 plus 2).

You then have to request a day and a rough time, and they'll tell you when to turn up and give you a reservation number. Pain in the ass, and not all of the people on the other end of the line speak very good English, but that's Rome - most things you encounter here are chaotic and badly managed. The alternative is you book with a tour company which has already bought tickets in advance, and their guide will show you the Forum and the rest of the Colosseum, then hand you over to the Colosseum guide for the underground and third tier tour. It might be worth the extra money not to have all the hassle, plus having a guide in the Forum is really worthwhile because it's so big and so amazingly interesting when you know what you're looking at.

Edit: [here's](http://www.walksofitaly.com/tour_bookings/tour_all_listing/1/65) an example of a Forum, Colosseum, Underground and Third Tier guided tour. As you can see, it doesn't come cheap but it does take the guesswork out.

2) Nope. But it's very easy to get one from a machine. Be warned though: the maximum change the machines can make is €6, so make sure you buy them with a combination of €10s and €20s so you get your change back. Note that you can change the machine's display to English. 

Or just go into a tabacci, which hopefully should have change for anything you have. Note that the weekly ticket doesn't get you to and from the airport: you have to pay separately for that ticket. 

Edit 2: the weekly ticket doesn't last exactly seven days - it expires at midnight of the seventh day from when you first use it. E.g. use it Monday afternoon, it will expire at midnight the next Sunday. I got caught out by that when I first arrived. The daily ticket does that too, which is a fucking joke. Use one at 11.59 pm and it expires 1 minute later.

3) Well the pizza's *OK* here, but not particularly special. To me that's a bit like someone from Italy saying ""I hear that the lox, bagels and pastrami-on-rye are good in America, and I can't wait to go to San Diego to try them"" (exaggeration for humorous purposes).

Same here. I'm not saying OP literally meant it that way and I'm also not saying that poverty is non-existent here: But asking on a political subreddit of a country/region how to eat out of dumbsters and phrase it like:

&gt; Where and what kind of food people eat out of garbage in your neighborhood?'

The message it (unintentionally) sends is that apparently the people here must be knowledgeable about how to eat out of dumbsters. Implying that a lot of people in Europe do, which implies there are enough people in Europe that are forced by poverty or other stuff to eat from dumbsters.

Now for the billionth time for any political correct idiot that's reading this: I am NOT saying they do not exist and I am NOT saying everyone who does it is somehow low, poor or pathetic. The Swedish student example you gave was a good one, but dumpster eating like that is not a giant thing here in Europe. What I'm saying is that the question itself phrased like this, is implying that Europe is some kind of place where poverty reigns widespread.

The question wouldn't be rude if it were phrased better (We don't know if OP meant it as I explained or if he simply phrased it incorrect), or if it was posted on a less political subreddit.

I sincerely hope people won't give you the same treatment if something bad happens to you. If you try hard enough, it's easy to find something wrong with someone and attribute their woes to it. In the case of Greece, while I agree that there was a ton of things that were and still are wrong in the country, it's is completely stupid to believe that the economic situation now was a direct result of it and there were no external factors whatsoever and therefore Greeks deserve ""to suffer for their sins"". There is a difference between taking responsibility for yourself and self-flagellation.

As for the media myth created to make populations of Northern countries feel righteous and supportive for the austerity/colonization experiment in Greece, that of bad, lazy, cheating people being rightfully punished by the saintly, just EU... sorry I can't go there again.

I agree, although I don't think that was created *solely* by Greeks. Probably mainly, but there has been a lot of foreign meddling in 20th-century Greece as well, starting with the civil war, then the military dictatorship, and at times almost a parallel state-within-a-state run by the military (which was certainly known about and tolerated, possibly encouraged, by their NATO counterparts). The other state-within-a-state, the rather corrupt Church of Greece, is on the other hand entirely domestic. I don't know what percentage I'd put on the relative responsibility, but maybe 20-25% of the fuckups relate to events that I'd group under ""Cold War realpolitik"", together with backlashes against such events (e.g. the 17 November terrorist group initially had a reasonable amount of public support, because it was, with some justification, seen as an anti-junta and anti-CIA resistance).",0,1405187095,null,0,1405208165,0,civjm1x,t3_2aii1j,t1_civjm1x,t1_civit7s,null,1434681870,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Critics of Ms. Merkel's pro-U.S. stance have long been largely confined to the opposition, but skepticism was spreading through the government's ranks this week, underlining the chancellor's mounting challenge. Ralf Stegner, an influential vice chairman of the Social Democrats, Ms. Merkel's junior governing partner, said the spy allegations undermined the case for a trans-Atlantic free-trade agreement Ms. Merkel has been supporting.

    Ms. Merkel's former justice minister, a member of the traditionally pro-American Free Democratic Party, said Wednesday that she wanted negotiations on that agreement to be put on ice and NSA leaker Edward Snowden to be granted the right to stay in Germany.

    ""We can't go on like this,"" said Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, who held the cabinet post until Ms. Merkel formed a new government without her party in December. 
""The Americans know no boundaries. They will only understand a clear message."" . . .""

2. "". . . With the notable exception of the War of 1812, the United States did not face any significant foreign incursions in the 19th century. It contained the threat from both Canada and Mexico with a minimum of disruption to American life and in so doing ended the risk of local military conflicts with other countries. North America was viewed as a remarkably safe place.

    Even the American Civil War did not disrupt this belief. The massive industrial and demographic imbalance between North and South meant that the war's outcome was never in doubt. The North's population was four times the size of the population of free Southerners while its industrial base was 10 times that of the South. As soon as the North's military strategy started to leverage those advantages the South was crushed. Additionally, most of the settlers of the Midwest and West Coast were from the North (Southern settlers moved into what would become Texas and New Mexico), so the dominant American culture was only strengthened by the limits placed on the South during Reconstruction.

    As a result, life for this dominant 'Northern' culture got measurably better every single year for more than five generations. Americans became convinced that such a state of affairs -- that things can, will and should improve every day -- was normal. Americans came to believe that their wealth and security is a result of a Manifest Destiny that reflects something different about Americans compared to the rest of humanity. The sense is that Americans are somehow better -- destined for greatness -- rather than simply being very lucky to live where they do. It is an unbalanced and inaccurate belief, but it is at the root of American mania and arrogance.

    Many Americans do not understand that the Russian wheat belt is the steppe, which has hotter summers, colder winters and less rain than even the relatively arid Great Plains. There is not a common understanding that the histories of China and Europe are replete with genocidal conflicts because different nationalities were located too close together, or that the African plateaus hinder economic development. Instead there is a general understanding that the United States has been successful for more than two centuries and that the rest of the world has been less so. Americans do not treasure the 'good times' because they see growth and security as the normal state of affairs, and Americans are more than a little puzzled as to why the rest of the world always seems to be struggling. And so what Americans see as normal day-to-day activities the rest of the world sees as American hubris.

    But not everything goes right all the time. What happens when something goes wrong, when the rest of the world reaches out and touches the Americans on something other than America's terms? When one is convinced that things can, will and should continually improve, the shock of negative developments or foreign interaction is palpable. Mania becomes depression and arrogance turns into panic. . . .""

The Court has established[1] that the data controller (which includes search engines indexing the data) must consider the merits of a removal request, but it has full faculty to reject one. Nowhere does the ruling mandate any kind of automatic procedure.

Okay, but now let's work in the real world. It isn't feasible for a company like Google to take a look at millions of requests. They've faced this problem before, and you know what it results in? The DMCA takedown system on YouTube. 

Forcing these things onto a single entity is simply a bad, bad, bad, idea.

They're allowed to consider the requests. Seeing as you simply cannot reject all requests as that would get you in trouble, they're simply going to automatically approve them. And that leads to the next point.

&gt;Beside the point raised above, which already removes any doubt as to whether information in the public interest can be removed on request (it can't), the CJEU ruling makes an explicit distinction between public and private figures[4] .

Europe stands for everything RIGHT with the western world. Human rights, social security, good living conditions, standards of exellence. Quite honestly, the people still stuck in the colonial era, are not the ones having any say in the global arena. You're referring to the past, Europe was led by monarchies back then, that's how far back you have to go. Europe has evolved, comparing them to the colonial times and saying THAT'S why Europe can't have a top spot in the world is child logic. In the end nobody will have a vote on the top spot, it will just happen, if people like you like it or not. Point still stands, Europe is the moral and societal goal of the developing nations, no nation is trying to look like China or India.

China is build on quick sands. The shadow banking system will catch up to them, just like the economic collapse put a stop on Japan's unbelievable rise in the late 90s. Bodies don't equal power, sooner or later the people will want to have more of a say, and when they can't be appeased by economic growth anymore, China will have to have a serious discussion with itself.

India. Come on man. Have you actually looked into that country and visited it? India will become an important power, but is so disfunctional that seeing them as global leaders is absolutely laughable. Talk about caste system, their strange working environment which doesn't allow open dialogue and criticism. Please inform yourself before you praise India. They have a lot of problems which make it impossible for them to be considered fit for leading.

China and Russia building up a coalition. You might want to look into German - Russian alliance building over the last decade and a half. How many European companies have investments in Russia to keep up their economy. Saying Russia will do anything but grow closer to Europe is just showing lack of geopolitical understanding. Ukraine? Who gives a damn. I would've done the same as Russia. Kiev, Ukraine is the birthplace of the Russian people. Ukraine was always under Russian influence, maybe you shouldn't put too much weight on the Ukraine crisis, because frankly it isn't really important.

    Many in the German business community are trying to protect their investments in Russia from U.S.-led sanctions. A new generation of Germans in their 20s and 30s know the United States only in its post-9/11 guise: Afghanistan, Iraq, surveillance, fingerprinting at the borders, spying on friendly nations and their leaders, renditions and targeted killings.

    It is not uncommon to hear young Germans ask: 'What makes the U.S. different from Russia or China?'

    It is easy to dismiss such distorted perceptions, but they matter. America is increasingly seen as a paranoid society that cannot distinguish between friends and foes anymore.

Critics of Ms. Merkel's pro-U.S. stance have long been largely confined to the opposition, but skepticism was spreading through the government's ranks this week, underlining the chancellor's mounting challenge. Ralf Stegner, an influential vice chairman of the Social Democrats, Ms. Merkel's junior governing partner, said the spy allegations undermined the case for a trans-Atlantic free-trade agreement Ms. Merkel has been supporting.

    Ms. Merkel's former justice minister, a member of the traditionally pro-American Free Democratic Party, said Wednesday that she wanted negotiations on that agreement to be put on ice and NSA leaker Edward Snowden to be granted the right to stay in Germany.

2. "". . . With the notable exception of the War of 1812, the United States did not face any significant foreign incursions in the 19th century. It contained the threat from both Canada and Mexico with a minimum of disruption to American life and in so doing ended the risk of local military conflicts with other countries. North America was viewed as a remarkably safe place.

    Even the American Civil War did not disrupt this belief. The massive industrial and demographic imbalance between North and South meant that the war's outcome was never in doubt. The North's population was four times the size of the population of free Southerners while its industrial base was 10 times that of the South. As soon as the North's military strategy started to leverage those advantages the South was crushed. Additionally, most of the settlers of the Midwest and West Coast were from the North (Southern settlers moved into what would become Texas and New Mexico), so the dominant American culture was only strengthened by the limits placed on the South during Reconstruction.

    As a result, life for this dominant 'Northern' culture got measurably better every single year for more than five generations. Americans became convinced that such a state of affairs -- that things can, will and should improve every day -- was normal. Americans came to believe that their wealth and security is a result of a Manifest Destiny that reflects something different about Americans compared to the rest of humanity. The sense is that Americans are somehow better -- destined for greatness -- rather than simply being very lucky to live where they do. It is an unbalanced and inaccurate belief, but it is at the root of American mania and arrogance.

    Many Americans do not understand that the Russian wheat belt is the steppe, which has hotter summers, colder winters and less rain than even the relatively arid Great Plains. There is not a common understanding that the histories of China and Europe are replete with genocidal conflicts because different nationalities were located too close together, or that the African plateaus hinder economic development. Instead there is a general understanding that the United States has been successful for more than two centuries and that the rest of the world has been less so. Americans do not treasure the 'good times' because they see growth and security as the normal state of affairs, and Americans are more than a little puzzled as to why the rest of the world always seems to be struggling. And so what Americans see as normal day-to-day activities the rest of the world sees as American hubris.

    But not everything goes right all the time. What happens when something goes wrong, when the rest of the world reaches out and touches the Americans on something other than America's terms? When one is convinced that things can, will and should continually improve, the shock of negative developments or foreign interaction is palpable.

    Should the rocket explode and kill Glenn, they wrote, ""the objective is to provide irrevocable proof that the fault lies with the Communists et all Cuba [sic].""

    The plans were motivated by an intense desire among senior military leaders to depose Castro, who seized power in 1959 to become the first communist leader in the Western Hemisphere -- only 90 miles from U.S. shores.

    The earlier CIA-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by Cuban exiles had been a disastrous failure, in which the military was not allowed to provide firepower. The military leaders now wanted a shot at it. . . .""

It's not rocket science to get briefed by assistants and civil servants and then absorb the essential information, that's how ministers learn most of their subject matter.

    Many in the German business community are trying to protect their investments in Russia from U.S.-led sanctions. A new generation of Germans in their 20s and 30s know the United States only in its post-9/11 guise: Afghanistan, Iraq, surveillance, fingerprinting at the borders, spying on friendly nations and their leaders, renditions and targeted killings.

    It is not uncommon to hear young Germans ask: 'What makes the U.S. different from Russia or China?'

    It is easy to dismiss such distorted perceptions, but they matter. America is increasingly seen as a paranoid society that cannot distinguish between friends and foes anymore. This perception is eroding America's standing in the world. As one Berlin policymaker suggested: 'The U.S. is digging its own grave with regard to its global leadership aspirations.' . . .""

    (e) "". . . Critics of Ms. Merkel's pro-U.S. stance have long been largely confined to the opposition, but skepticism was spreading through the government's ranks this week, underlining the chancellor's mounting challenge. Ralf Stegner, an influential vice chairman of the Social Democrats, Ms. Merkel's junior governing partner, said the spy allegations undermined the case for a trans-Atlantic free-trade agreement Ms. Merkel has been supporting.

    Ms. Merkel's former justice minister, a member of the traditionally pro-American Free Democratic Party, said Wednesday that she wanted negotiations on that agreement to be put on ice and NSA leaker Edward Snowden to be granted the right to stay in Germany.

    'We can't go on like this,' said Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, who held the cabinet post until Ms. Merkel formed a new government without her party in December.

2. "". . . With the notable exception of the War of 1812, the United States did not face any significant foreign incursions in the 19th century. It contained the threat from both Canada and Mexico with a minimum of disruption to American life and in so doing ended the risk of local military conflicts with other countries. North America was viewed as a remarkably safe place.

    Even the American Civil War did not disrupt this belief. The massive industrial and demographic imbalance between North and South meant that the war's outcome was never in doubt. The North's population was four times the size of the population of free Southerners while its industrial base was 10 times that of the South. As soon as the North's military strategy started to leverage those advantages the South was crushed. Additionally, most of the settlers of the Midwest and West Coast were from the North (Southern settlers moved into what would become Texas and New Mexico), so the dominant American culture was only strengthened by the limits placed on the South during Reconstruction.

    As a result, life for this dominant 'Northern' culture got measurably better every single year for more than five generations. Americans became convinced that such a state of affairs -- that things can, will and should improve every day -- was normal. Americans came to believe that their wealth and security is a result of a Manifest Destiny that reflects something different about Americans compared to the rest of humanity. The sense is that Americans are somehow better -- destined for greatness -- rather than simply being very lucky to live where they do. It is an unbalanced and inaccurate belief, but it is at the root of American mania and arrogance.

    Many Americans do not understand that the Russian wheat belt is the steppe, which has hotter summers, colder winters and less rain than even the relatively arid Great Plains. There is not a common understanding that the histories of China and Europe are replete with genocidal conflicts because different nationalities were located too close together, or that the African plateaus hinder economic development. Instead there is a general understanding that the United States has been successful for more than two centuries and that the rest of the world has been less so. Americans do not treasure the 'good times' because they see growth and security as the normal state of affairs, and Americans are more than a little puzzled as to why the rest of the world always seems to be struggling. And so what Americans see as normal day-to-day activities the rest of the world sees as American hubris.

    But not everything goes right all the time. What happens when something goes wrong, when the rest of the world reaches out and touches the Americans on something other than America's terms? When one is convinced that things can, will and should continually improve, the shock of negative developments or foreign interaction is palpable. Mania becomes depression and arrogance turns into panic. . . .""

    Should the rocket explode and kill Glenn, they wrote, ""the objective is to provide irrevocable proof that the fault lies with the Communists et all Cuba [sic].""

    The plans were motivated by an intense desire among senior military leaders to depose Castro, who seized power in 1959 to become the first communist leader in the Western Hemisphere -- only 90 miles from U.S. shores.

    The earlier CIA-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by Cuban exiles had been a disastrous failure, in which the military was not allowed to provide firepower. The military leaders now wanted a shot at it. . . .""

true,MrKnot,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Okay, but now let's work in the real world. It isn't feasible for a company like Google to take a look at millions of requests. They've faced this problem before, and you know what it results in? The DMCA takedown system on YouTube. 

I'm glad you brought this up because comparisons with the DMCA's takedown notice system are another form of misconception that have cropped up.

The CJEU ruling does not create a removal system, especially a system that is in any way comparable to the precisely delineated steps mandated by the DMCA. The CJEU ruling establishes a very broad standard of behavior that requires only two things: that companies look into removal requests, and that denied requests can be heard by a civil authority for reconsideration. It does not mandate timeframes, due diligence standards or anything of the sort. It does not provide for fines, penalties or even the ability to sue a non-compliant company.

The severity of the obligations imposed by the CJEU ruling is infinitely smaller than that created by DMCA's provisions. The two are in no way comparable, the idea that they must lead to the same problems is speculative at best.

&gt; Forcing these things onto a single entity is simply a bad, bad, bad, idea.

This ruling does not apply exclusively to Google.

Usually ""getting hang of new ideas"" doesn't involve admitting in twitter that he doesn't know the difference between communists and fascists. 

&gt;Stubb was a professor at the College of Europe before getting into politics - what sort of credentials are you looking for? 

He was a professor of European Affairs, which means the job doesn't involve knowing anything of any other subjects. His political posts were a MEP and as minister of European affairs.  They all have narrow fields. 

&gt; Our previous finance minister was a school teacher

And she did such a great job, too!

&gt;..and the current one is a trade unionist

Meaning he's theoretically well-versed in the needs of workers and companies both. We shall see how well that works in practice.

&gt;It's not rocket science to get briefed by assistants and civil servants and then absorb the essential information, that's how ministers learn most of their subject matter.

No, it's not necessary to know every small detail. But if you don't have an education (or experience) on the topic beforehand, you're wholly dependant on the civil servants and lobbyists. I probably don't need to tell that this is an awful thing.. The most popular example is probably *Yes, Minister*.

&gt;The communism/fascism one was probably some rhetoric jibe designed to highlight the nasty side of soviet communism. I don't believe he doesn't get the difference, cmon.

He said this as a reference after that neonazi stabbed people in a Leftis book launch. The other side published a book, the other side stabbed people. No difference.

&gt;Do you have a source for your claim of Stubb's political guidelights? It isn't rare at all to be inspired by people who think differently. I seriously doubt he completely equated the beliefs of two partisans.


I couldn't find the link, but he was talking about Swedish NCP and how the faction that had Reinfeldt and some other guy was the one that was closest to his heart. ""The other guy"" was in the internal opposition of the same party. As I recall, he claimed that he knew both men very well and was intimately well familiar with their politics.

&gt;Your post reads like you don't like him, but I don't think the reasons you've stated sound very convincing. Perhaps you also just don't like the politics he is (perceived to be) standing for.

I don't, which is why I started by saying ""excluding his political party"". Inside his political party, I was rooting for Risikko. Stubb was my least favourite choice, the least good representative of his party by ideology or experience.

true,EmperorZIZ,EURO,Belgium likes no war neigbours,"Kids learn about the details of the political system in the last years of high school, as it is a pretty difficult system (for example, i had to learn what our latest change in our constitution meant for our country in the last year). 

You learn about the rise of different political systems of important European countries (Italy, UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands get almost all attention), but we also learn in short about the rise of our own politcal parties and what their basic standpoints are. After that it depends on how well you educate yourself if you really want details about parties. Most people i know (who don't do an in-depth study of politics) vote on a party because of ideology and the stand-points they advertise the most (example: socialists promoted school reform and less austerity, conservatives promoted their stand on pensions,...). 

So, to sum it up, we start to learn about politics around the age of 16, because the system's pretty difficult. Yet, the quality (at least the one i received) was very good. 

NOTE: we have four different types of school here: ASO (general education), KSO (art), TSO (technical, jobs like electricians get taught here), BSO (craftsmanship: carpenters and such). I followed ASO, which gives you that coverage of politics. I suspect the other four types of school don't cover politics in a in-depth way (in BSO, probably not at all).",0,1405193867,null,0,false,0,civmg4k,t3_2aewxc,t1_civmg4k,t1_civ02rg,null,1434683300,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,ajuc,POLA,Poland,"In Polish the numbers change depending on gender and ""personality"" of the noun they count.


1 = jedno (for neutral nouns like apple), jeden (for masculine nouns like car, dog, soldier, boy), jedna (for feminine nouns like river, girl)

2 = dwa (for non-personal-masculine nouns like apples, cars, dogs), dwóch (for personal-masculine nouns like soldiers, boys, etc), dwie (for feminine nouns like rivers, girls)

3 = trzy (for non-personal-masculine and feminine nouns like apples, rivers, cars, dogs, girls), trzech (for personal-masculine nouns like soldiers, boys, etc)

for bigger numbers the only special version is for personal-masculinem like for 3. So in Polish big group of males (like army for example) have special grammatical form. These versions also have different version of each verbs, so in Polish one word like ""rozmawiały"" describes both action (to talk), the tense (past), plurality and the object (group of females). For present tense it would be ""rozmawiają"" and for males it would be ""rozmawiali"". You can't form one present tense sentence in Polish without telling people which gender you are.
...


Also the nouns change depending on the numbers - there are 3 versions of each noun depending on the number, and the rules are kinda weird:


1 apple = 1 jabłko

2,3,4 apples = 2,3,4 jabłka

5-21 apples = 5-21 jabłek

22-24 apples =  22-24 jabłka

25-31 apples = 25-31 jabłek

32-34 apples = 32-34 jabłka

...

This means almost all foreign programs translated into Polish have the numerals wrong in the messages (""you have copied x file(s)"" would be in Polish ""Skopiowałeś x plik(i)(ów)"" using the above rules, and for female users it should be ""Skopiowałaś ..."").

Opinion on point 4: it can be argued that public figures count only as public figures when the undertake public action, in the rest of the time they like any other person are ordinary citizens with the right to privacy.

Thank you for clearing things up, but every law ever made was made with the best of intentions(at the very least in theory), people are just smart enough to circumvent it to serve their interest, that is why absolutes are preferable to particular laws that can not anticipate human behavior or ingenuity.",0,1405197739,null,0,false,0,civo3xk,t3_2aikbi,t1_civo3xk,t3_2aikbi,null,1434684059,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,SuperAlbertN7,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; That's fine, I'd just like to point out why we're going in circles constantly.

We kind of were but i guess that would come from you mostly making the same claims and me disproving them the same way. (my prospective)

&gt;You believe that it is possible to nullify and eliminate instincts like tribalism and territorialism. You can supress them but you can not eliminate them. I, on the other hand believe that humans are not born with blank slate, a slate which you can mold and shape in something you want. People are born with pre-determined traits, both physical and psychological.

Maybe but none of our instincts are strong enough (except maybe sexual drive) to overpower our human capacity for reason. I don't believe humans a born with a blank mind but i also don't think that mind has any concept of race. If anything it's the environment that shapes people into these concepts. Say if a child was raised in a village where the population was very diverse and no one really ever thought anything of it he would not recognize the concept of race.

Of course humans already have the ideas of society and morals with them. But not in the sense that humans are born with a set of morals and an idea of which society they belong to. But in the sense that humans know instinctively how to form up into societies and follow the morals that society imposes on them. An most societies will also have an idea of us and them since societies compete for resources and land. Race is just a furthering of us vs them mentality when European kings needed a justification for colonizing most of the world. And i will guarantee you that if an alien fleet showed up tomorrow humanity would be quick to unite against the common enemy. But even then we don't need a common threat to get over petty nationalism. You just have to be rational and forget countries and races and instead think of humanity as a whole.

&gt;Rational wiki is run by left wing ideologues and it's filled with nonsense and fallacies, it's even worse than conservapedia.

I went through a few pages and while it may need some cleaning it is most defiantly not worse than conservapedia since Rational wiki at least seems to not outright deny science and i have yet to see a as prosperous claim as the consevervapedia's claim that the biblical global flood was caused by water sitting under the earths crust which didn't boil when it was ejected but instead hit the moon creating the craters then flooded the earth not killing all oceanic life like normal boiling hot water would have or just fresh water. And then finally earth was repopulated by animals being rocketed trough the atmosphere via volcanic eruption again not killing them. And then somehow in the 4000 years till now the entirety of all the species appeared again.

But at least we agree conservapedia is nonsense.

Also this doesn't lend any more credibility to the website you listed. Which used blogs and clearly very poor science as proof.

Lastly Rational wikis point that it is impossible to conduct any sort of science based on the classic Caucasian, Asian, African and Indian races still stands due to the enormous genetic diversity in not only Africa but all of the world even you and me (i'm guessing your french from your flag) are part of two different gene groups. And in Africa there is even more diversity.

Now as my final statement i will say this on the topic of immigration and globalization.

We live in a world that is slowly getting more and more interconnected and as a result of that more and more people are moving around the globe. Currently this is causing some trouble in some countries due to cultural differences but it is also more and more apparent that a common world culture is slowly developing. People can more and more identify with the same things and humans are learning to look past the national state and look at humanity as a whole. And even if there are genetic differences should we not seek to incorporate those? After all i a genetic trait does more harm than good it will disappear from the genetic pool. And there are many other benefits from a large genetic pool. In short the differences between humans in the long run won't be harmful but help humanity as a whole so that we may achieve greater things that any emperor or warlord could have ever imagined.

Now you can make a final statement just to make it fair and don't try to debate further i won't respond.",0,1405197906,null,0,false,0,civo6gx,t3_29vsyc,t1_civo6gx,t1_ciuid7z,null,1434684092,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,viktorbir,CATA,Catalonia,"Not really about numbers, but about time. There are two traditional ways to express time, relating to previous hour or to next one.

So, for example, Hungarian (I think) and most German and Catalan dialects will not say ""a quarter past seven"" or ""seven and a quarter"", but ""one quarter of eight"" or ""quarter eight"".

In Catalan half hours are ""two quarters"", so 7.30 is ""two quarters of eight"". In German, even in dialects where one and three quarters are expressed relating to the previous hour, half hours are always relating to next hour, so ""half eight"".

For the ones who find it nonsensical, consider it is more coherent with the rest of the way we tell time. We dont say we are at 2013 and a half, but on half 2014. Sunday at noon is the middle of Sunday, not Saturday and a half or half day past Saturday. 15th of July is half July, not half past June...

PS. In what other languages do you use this other way to express time? Any idea if ancient English used the German way?",0,1405198240,null,0,false,0,civobgr,t3_2ai8v7,t1_civobgr,t3_2ai8v7,null,1434684169,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The leading Finnish daily interviewed one private citizen who had filed a request to Google under the new legislation. He'd agreed to go on record with his own name. He'd had some past troubles with the law (several smaller fraud convictions) but had now reformed himself, he'd claimed. His victims' posts on internet forums had caused him trouble with relationships and finding work. Once the paper did some superficial research they found that there were a few fresher cases still in court. Once told about these findings he said that it was still ok, because it wasn't going on at the same volume as before. He asked them not to publish his name after all...

I don't want a single request by people like this to go through. The legislation needs to be made water-tight. It would probably have been a lesser evil if they had never implemented it in the first place. Even with Gonzales I don't find his case compelling.

Travaux Dirigé. Typiquement, dans les premières années, il y a peu d'exercices, tu rends un dossier à la fin du semestre. Ca dépends des matières. C'est le truc le plus proche du Lycée que tu trouvera dans une université. Les profs/instructeurs y sont plus accessibles que dans les amphis, et c'est souvent là qu'on y pratique la théorie.

* En amphi les eleves peuvent prendrent la parole? 

Ca dépends du prof. Certains profs posent des questions à l'amphi, d'autres font littéralement un cours magistral, (d'ailleurs la plupart des cours en amphi sont des CM). La prise de parole se trouve plutot dans les TD. Si tu veux poser des questions au prof, envoie lui un courriel (tout les profs ont une adresse mail à l'université et la consulte), ou vient le voir après le cours.


* C'est quoi un partiel? 

Les partiels sont des épreuves que tu passe à la fin du semestre afin de le valider. IL y a un partiel par Unité d'Enseignement, typiquement. Cela peut être des épreuves écrites ou orales. Certaines UE n'ont pas de partiels et se notent uniquement sur la base du Controle Continu, comme au Lycée.

* A la fac y'a des oraux?

Oh que oui.

* J'ai peur que ce que j'ai choisi ne me plaise pas. La réorientation c'est facile?

Ca dépends des universités. Typiquement, si tu valide le premier semestre tu peux te réorienter et passer ton second semestre dans un autre cursus sans perdre le premier semestre. Vois avec ton université. Si tu veux changer d'université, ça se complique.

 Les étudiants souhaitant se réorienter sont ils prioritaires sur les bacheliers entrant en fac?

En général oui. Vois avec ton université.

0) Can a company continually deny your vacation dates using the excuse that too many other employees are already off during that time? They are basically forcing me to take vacation days right now that I don't want to take and refusing every date I've asked.  

Yes. Technically they don't have to allow choice in holidays. Some places close for three weeks in august, others refuse anything requested with less than 3 months notice. Others state 2 consecutive weeks may only be taken in x quarter ie august to oct etc. 

Your contract shoukd spe ify


1) I'm under the impression that standard contracts are 3 months probationary period followed by yearly contracts? During the probationary period you can leave without notice and after you have to give 15 days? Is this correct and/or can it vary? Somebody I talked to yesterday said they had to give a month's notice. 

Depends on contract. Normally it is based on how you are paid ie paid monthly, a months notice. Some places base it in length of time ie 1 year, 2 weeks, 3 years 2 months...




 
2) This company allows employees on later shifts to skip lunch but not employees on earlier shifts. Shouldn't it be all or nothing?  

No. Employers right but check with your union.

3) This company sends paystubs in a password ""protected"" zip via email and provides NO other way to get them. Is this legal?  

Yes. And better as no extra people in the office need to see your payslip.  Payslips are your responsibility to keep and honestly email makes it much easier. You normally need your nie as password so hard to hack.

The other stuff ie urinals etc bring up with the hr person and then a union rep, it might be a buildings owner responsibility and your bosses hands are tied waiting for them.

No one benefited as much from the Eurozone as the industrial exporting countries of the Eurozone, and to pretend otherwise is a huge disservice to the people of Europe. Trade tariffs gone, no currency exchange loss, no import taxation. Since the Eurozone's inception, German exports to Greece have risen by 150% - that is, they have more than doubled. I hope you understand how this is a massive increase in profits. 

In contrast, Greek exports to Germany have risen by almost 10%. That is a massively imbalanced trade deficit, and Greece has access to **none** of the corrective mechanisms that can be undertaken to fix it (measures such as FX reserves, import taxation, foreign exchange measures like raising or dropping the exchange rate), because the Eurozone leaders did not think that far. Any kind of corrective and collective mechanism that would attempt to restore parity (such as a theoretical Eurobond) have been shot down without a second thought by said exporting countries. 

And to address what you think is a benefit, holding a country that does **not** have a German economy's level sustainability to German standards, in order to access German interest rates, like for example inflation requirements, is definitely not a benefit. 

In short, Greece is held up by Germany and co. as a client state whose only role is to buy German products. When they inevitably fail because of these short-sighted policies, the strategy is to blame them to avoid any real examination of the problem.

@Naurgul: Most Greeks (maybe less now than the beginning of the crisis) will tell you that it's only external factors that contributed to the downturn of our economy and a you'll hear a lot of them saying the whole thing was planned and coordinated by evil forces that want Greece's downfall. This means that most people still haven't realised how much they have contributed to this, and that if they don't change their ways it will get even worse.

Arguing that our political culture has a lot to do with how the economy and society were badly formed is not wrong at all and it doesn't constitute victim blaming. Our political culture has inherited a lot of bad habits from its recent and distant past (i.e. 1967-74 Junta, Ottomans, etc.) and is complicated to explain in one comment.

Let's agree that the modern Greeks are slightly more connected to the Ancient Greeks than, say, are modern Londoners.  Just slightly. Athens wasn't Sparta or Corinth.  Greece as a country didn't exist. Ancient Greek language and culture was warped beyond recognition by Alexander, the Romans and the Turks to the extent that it really is a moot point, the extent to which modern Greeks share much more in terms of cultural heritage with 'their' past than others in Europe. I'd venture, for example, that Britain has had a firmer grasp on the notion of democracy than Greece has had for most of its existence. To whom does that heritage belong?

It's not so obviously, or uniquely, the Greeks, is it? It's all of us, isn't it. If you have something to be proud of it's exactly that.

The marbles are where they are. The transaction that brought them to Britain was *arguably* legitimate. The Ottomans damn near destroyed the entire Parthenon.

If they need coalition partners to their left like KKE they will likely be more willing to negotiate on this issue such as putting it to a referendum but the discord between Syriza and KKE is so big due to KKE's refusal to cooperate with any other leftist movement on anything that I think Syriza's path to government is cooperation with more moderate parties (that is to say, Syriza, a democratic socialist party and member of the GUE cooperating with the Democratic Left, a social democratic party).

Also ... real estate tax only is applicable if you own real estate (which usually generates income), health insurance is not exactly a tax, and an income tax rate of around 40% for a self-employed person has likely tons of deductions this ""small business owner"" doesn't claim.

Car insurance might be mandatory, but it's not a tax. It's operation costs of your vehicle.

Not really complaining, just presenting a specific case which I find horrendous. But I didn't really complain personally, I just presented the data and everyone seemed to be shocked. 

&gt; its reasonable to assume that you'd want an extensive state

Not very reasonable. I do want things to be released to the commons but centralising everything to a mostly undemocratic state is not my preferred solution. But I digress. 

&gt;  specially when looking at Greece that has previously been a very extensive welfare state from Papandreou the older up til now

You know nothing about Greek politics and it shows. Greece's state was never that extensive and the mention of the ""social democrat""-equivalent party leader by name makes me think you've been listening to the rhetoric of one too many Greek conservatives who are too keen to blame everything on the public sector. 

&gt; So, what does Syriza and Tsipras want to do with taxes in Greece

Do I look like a Syriza representative? Why am I supposed to answer for what Syriza might or might not do... What does Syriza even have to do with any of this...

&gt; for that small business owner? 

With that said, here's my take on the situation:

First, I think it's pretty obvious that the model of overtaxing because the states assumes you're going to avoid paying anyway is stupid and should be done away with. 

Second, taxation in Greece is too regressive and it should be made much more progressive. 

Third, the two things above are not enough to solve the problem at its root, because Greece's mad attempt to tax so much is a result of the crazy policies dictated at the European level. The Eurozone should either move towards becoming a fiscal union or disband and Greece granted a hefty debt relief; at least one of these things should happen or Greece, no matter how efficient and good-intentioned government it gets, will never be able to create a sane tax system.

true,_delirium,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; The treshold in Germany is at around 30000 €/year - which makes you live under survivable circumstances. If you earn less, health insurance will kill you.

Weird, that's definitely not the case in Denmark. If you earn €20k/yr, you can have a small but viable business. It may or may not make enough profit to pay its owner's rent, but that's another question. It will definitely not incur 75% taxes, and will clear a decent profit. There is also no separate fee for health insurance, because healthcare is a universal right of all residents, not something that is purchased by individuals or employers. I don't see any good reason that considerations of small business and considerations of healthcare should be intertwined; treating people's illnesses is not the job of business, but should rather be paid for out of normal income taxes.

Plus, Greece's standard of living is much lower to begin with. In my opinion making these kinds of businesses feasible is something that Greece needs to do, if they want to have any businesses at all. It's not realistic to expect people with a median income of €15,000/yr to all start €40,000/yr businesses. If someone wants to start a €20k/yr business, that seems positive to me, and worth encouraging.

&gt;More often than not, the demonstrators are protesting against projects that stand for change: extensions to airports, railways, new wind farms or power lines. Not even new subways or sports stadiums are exempt.  
  
What's that supposed to mean? So the fucked up projects are change? The Obama kind of change maybe. The only thing that changes is money - hands.  
  
  
&gt;But as the public's enthusiasm for constant innovation has lessened,  
  
That's just made-up bullshit, what sort of measure is ""enthusiasm for innovation"" even? What's happening is that many don't believe in the financing and promises of the projects and they're right more often than not, aren't they?  
  
  
&gt;Every major venture seems to entail spiraling costs. Berlin's new airport was supposed to cost €1.7 billion, a price tag that has shot up to well over €5 billion. Meanwhile, the €187 million earmarked for the Elbphilharmonie concert hall under construction in Hamburg is expected to exceed €865 million by the time the project is completed. Albig is well aware how bad this looks. ""People see us as financially incompetent,"" he says.   
  
  
There it is and the worst project hasn't even been mentioned: Toll Collect. People find officials incompetent to some degree, the main problem is that the spiraling costs systematically seem to vanish into private accounts never to be seen again while even government officials have no insight into the contracts and the ones who do are forbidden to talk to their colleagues about it. What am I supposed to make of this? That all of this is kosher and for the common good?  
  
  
&gt;For the time being, he and other politicians have no ready solution to all this public resentment.  
  
How about not doing all of the above you mentioned? How about making the contracts and financing public and also not putting it into a 35.000 page contract ([I'm not kidding, that's the size of a Toll Collect contract](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6rxxUN2m5Q#t=1128)), instead [Wikileaks needs to do the work](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/LKW-Maut-Wikileaks-veroeffentlicht-geheime-Maut-Unterlagen-868208.html). Even the MPs don't have insight in the PPP contracts they vote on. 
  
&gt;The public similarly quashed Munich's bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics last year.  
  
So every country is complaining about how hosting the Olympic Games is detrimental to them, how the IOC is corrupt and now you're not supposed to learn from it?  
  
  
&gt;""to get anything at all done in this country,"" he says. He doesn't bother making excuses for the noise pollution that Binner is so enraged about. ""Of course a new runway is unpopular with residents but should the world's fourth largest economy give up on international air traffic?"" he asks.  
  
I don't give a fuck about noise pollution and so do most of the airstrip's opponents, [32.8% of constituents participated in the public referendum and 55.4% voted against the airstrip which results in well over 200.000 people directly voting against it and not a few thousand](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/buergerentscheid-zum-flughafen-muenchen-freundliche-aufforderung-zum-politischen-suizid-11790184.html). It's like all the other fuck-up projects: Most of the jobs are only temporary, most of the scarce long term jobs are low wage jobs, the cost calculations are criminally unreliable and there just won't be much benefit with a little additional air-traffic to anybody but the companies operating the airfield all the while the air traffic is in decline (at the time of the votum at least). It's a shitty project, scrap it and it would have been scrapped if it wasn't for a few players making shitloads of money if it ever got greenlighted lobbying for it.  
  
  
&gt;s usual, it's a question of priorities and of what is more important -- the interests of a few hundred or thousand residents, or the greater good of the nation. ""The protesters don't think about how the country might benefit, they just think about themselves,"" complains Kerkloh.  
  
  
Again, not a few hundred or thousand and ""the country"" benefits as much from this as from the rest of the tax money sinkholes.  
  
  
&gt;The term ""Wutbürger"" (""enraged citizen"") was coined during the Stuttgart 21 fiasco to describe people like Hartmut Binner, and much has been written about them since. They often aren't the ""common man."" According to the Göttingen Institute for Democracy Studies, they tend to be highly educated people with steady incomes and white collar jobs. And while protests movements of the past were often steered by sociologists, today their leaders are more likely to stem from the technical professions, the researchers found.  
  
The term was coined to ridicule serious critique by painting it in the light of irrationality. Probably the same people who did the cost calculations worked on that one.  
  
  
Underlying all of this is the PPP model or Public-Private-Partnership, which is the main point of critique because it is a systematic one. Instead of direct privatization of infrastructure and guaranteed returns, private companies participate in the investment so the state can realize projects he doesn't have the money for. It's privatization before the fact. The people advocating it claim the projects are cheaper, which of course is bullshit and on paper since the [German Federal Court of Auditors audited 6 highways financed this way while the companies claimed there would be cost reductions of ~30%, costs actually increase ~15%](http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/oepp-privat-finanzierte-autobahnen-sind-teurer-als-staatlich-gebaute-a-974654.html).  
Ironically the article is by Der Spiegel. Note how Dobrindt is the same guy in this article who advocates PPP highway projects in this one although the German Federal Country of Auditors just disproved it.

I'd like to avoid a stroke. 

The problem isn't that ordinary people are lazy or cheating. It's that the EU cannot keep on giving loans that will never be re-paid to a government that is too corrupt/ignorant to fix their broken economic system. 

The taxes you mention is only one example. All economic theory suggests that taxes ought to be levied in a progressive way. When you tax larger players more than smaller ones it improves competition, and because small business owners and ordinary people have little choice but to spend their money on all but unavoidable expenses, it is dramatically more effective to give tax cuts and benefits to the bottom, instead of the tax cuts for rich people. 

The issues is that Greece's government was so deep in bed with business and unions that they utterly failed to pass any reform until the situation became unsustainable, and now that voters have lost faith in their leaders they turned to radicals who are unwilling to compromise in any way, thus making it immensely difficult to fix the mess.

Because you targeted Islam specifically. Why not criticize all religion, given that slavery also has an extremely prominent root in Christianity? What is it about Islam specifically? Not to mention the anti-Civil Rights movement in say, countries like the US, were very much rooted in Christian movements - for example, the Klu Klux Klan.

Christianity is of relevance to any discussion involving direct criticism of Islam, as it is to ensure the logical consistency of the critic. If Islam is a truly evil belief system for X, Y, and Z reasons, then surely Christianity(And other beliefs) should also be evil if they fit the same criteria.

&gt;I'm not a Christian and the actions of Christians bear absolutely no relevance to this discussion. 

Yeah, sure, so you're not a Christian - why is it then the only religion you're constantly criticizing in your comment history is Islam, despite the fact it shares hundreds of similarities to Christianity?

Why is it Islam that is constantly the target? Why not at least attempt to hide your bias, or be consistent, by criticizing religion as a whole? Or even just Abrahamic religions? Nope, just Islam. 

In fact, you've gone so far as to express open hatred for Islam and advocate for **banning** it as a ""primitive, barbaric ideology"". So, tell me, where is this shared hatred for Christianity? You're not a Christian, after all, you should be able to impartially assess both religions on their merits and reasonably deduce than they're both incredibly similar in their teachings. Yet you don't seem to ever speak negatively of Christianity, or its other cousin religion, Judaism. 

Assuming that you, as an Indian-American, are Atheist - Why is it, then, that Islam specifically, objectively, bothers you more than a practice of another religion that fits the same criteria?

&gt;However, I will point out that no other modern religion (Christianity included), codifies and legitimizes slavery in its holy book the way Islam does.

That is factually incorrect. Normally I would suggest a reread of both the Bible and the Qur'an, but after reading your comments(Not just now, but in general on this subreddit), I am of the belief you have read neither the Bible **or** the Qur'an, so there is no *re*read to be had.

No I didn't, *you* made the assertion that ""Those who use Islam to justify cruel practices or those who attempt to force those practices on others are practicing a bastardization of Islam.""

&gt;Why not criticize all religion, given that slavery also has an extremely prominent root in Christianity? What is it about Islam specifically? Not to mention the anti-Civil Rights movement in say, countries like the US, were very much rooted in Christian movements - for example, the Klu Klux Klan.

No, just because Christians have practiced slavery doesn't mean it's prominently rooted in it. The prophet Mohammed himself took and owned slaves. There's no similar precedent in Christianity. And to answer your comment on the KKK/anti-civil rights movement, Christians were *also* involved, arguably to a much greater extent in the abolitionist and the civil rights movements. Hell, remember the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King?

&gt;Christianity is of relevance to any discussion involving direct criticism of Islam, as it is to ensure the logical consistency of the critic. If Islam is a truly evil belief system for X, Y, and Z reasons, then surely Christianity(And other beliefs) should also be evil if they fit the same criteria.

No, it's like coming into a discussion on the prohibition of heroin and saying ""well, alcohol's bad too"". You wouldn't be wrong, but it's not relevant to the discussion at hand.

&gt;Yeah, sure, so you're not a Christian - why is it then the only religion you're constantly criticizing in your comment history is Islam, despite the fact it shares hundreds of similarities to Christianity?

If it were a few hundred years ago I'd be criticizing Christianity, but the fact is that Christianity has evolved. There aren't any Christian governments putting people to death for apostasy or witchcraft, and there aren't sizable numbers of Christians in first world countries calling for the arrest and prosecution of those who insult Christianity. Christianity simply isn't a problem anymore.

&gt;Yet you don't seem to ever speak negatively of Christianity, or its other cousin religion, Judaism.

When are there ever similar headlines about Christians or Jews? Even when the rare lone nut like Breivik pops up, he's *always* working alone, never part of a larger movement, and support for those people is nonexistent.

&gt;That is factually incorrect. Normally I would suggest a reread of both the Bible and the Qur'an, but after reading your comments(Not just now, but in general on this subreddit), I am of the belief you have read neither the Bible or the Qur'an, so there is no reread to be had.

Well I appreciate you calling me wrong without providing any actual evidence.

Yes, it is. No, it is not. That's the whole point. Continuity of culture is defined by what, in your view? Language? Modern Greek is very similar to ancient Greek. By geography? Check. By y-haplogroup distribution? Check. 

Athens and Sparta and Corinth may not have been one country, but they were definitively one nation. They thought of themselves as Greeks, they spoke mutually intelligible dialects of the same language. It's absurd, offensive, and nonsensical to think you have more claim to ancient greek monuments, that were moreover constructed as part of an architectural feature that was **in** Athens. 

&gt;Ancient Greek language and culture was warped beyond recognition by Alexander, the Romans and the Turks to the extent that it really is a moot point, the extent to which modern Greeks share much more in terms of cultural heritage with 'their' past than others in Europe. 

I've already addressed this, and you refuse to listen. Any way you cut it, even with your spurious and offensive, and even borderline racist claims that modern Greeks have been ""warped beyond recognition"" from the ancient Greeks, they still, after centuries, have more in common than anyone British does. Furthermore, like I said, culture isn't defined genetically like you are trying to do, nor is it a constant thing. It's defined, contained by, and changed within, language, geography, morals, traditions, all of which the modern Greeks have in common with the ancient Greeks a thousand times more than the English. 

There is absolutely no claim based on culture you can make that can be more legitimate than that of the modern Greek state. 

And the fact that you seem to think yourself fit to judge which cultures have and have not anything in common with their ancient ancestors is yet another thing that speaks volumes about yourself, may I add. You don't see anyone here making claims that the British have been diluted by centuries of intermingling with, let us say, Indians, or any other cultures subjugated by the British Empire.

And are you seriously wanting to compare the economies of the United States, Japan, and Germany to that of Greece? Are you aware how many security valves the States for example have on a Federal level to prevent financial meltdown? Are you aware that, to prevent a debt crisis in 2008, the US essentially bought out debt by printing more money, something Greece could never in a million years have done after it joined the Eurozone because it wasn't in control of its currency? 

Greece didn't start way worse off. It was at 98% debt to gdp ratio, which is fair for a country that is always been a net importer. The trend is the same, like you mentioned. So how was it way worse off? It wasn't. The problems were there, but they have been magnified and exacerbated a hundredfold because of the Eurozone's poor design. Like I said, Greece has no access to correcting mechanisms of its economy. They are at the hands of the European Central Bank, that has shown absolutely no incentive to help out beleaguered countries, which is what the Eurozone compact was to begin with. 

What are those comparisons you made worth? Absolutely nothing. Any one country cannot be considered *in vacuo*. Do you want to completely ignore the economic history of Greece in favor of making a worthless comparison with a country a hundred times as large?

In Austria, there has been an uprising of various ""initiatives"" against a railway tunnel. The capital Vienna and the 2nd largest city, Graz, the federal state of Carinthia, Slovenia and Italy are connected by a railway line that crosses the alps south of Vienna. This railway line - more exactly the part across the Semmering ([map](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/47.6609/15.8582))- was built 160 years ago. It has since been electrified, but as it had been constructed with the technical means of the 19 century, it only allows slow speeds between 60 and 80 km/h. This part of the line, that goes through the mountains along many slopes  is also not suitable for heavy freight trains. The industries south of this part of the line can not be supplied by heavy trains, which causes them to have a disadvantage, that has been damaging the area. 

To solve the problems with this line, a tunnel is beeing built that avoids the part through the mountains. The area is far from larger settlements. Despite this, a number of groups appears, that vocally transports more and more absurd arguments against the tunnel. Despite them beeing small groups in numbers, they manage to get a surprising amount of media attention. Their arguments have long been falsified. They wouldn't be a problem if they wouldn't be able to make objections and claims in the various legal processes that come with a large-scale construction project. Their claims usually refer to tiny details. A few months ago, construction had to be paused because during the preparation for construction works, plans were only made so that someone who lives in a remote house would not face noise over average levels around his house. Some court agreed on the claim, that measures would have to be taken so that this person would also not face noise over average levels around a small pond in his garden. There are some rumors and evidences that point to the car lobby as the hidden sponsor of this ""actitivism"", but no definive proof exists.

What confuses me about this small uprising against that tunnel is, that those ""activists"" are able to disturb an absolutely necessary railway improvement and to keep their absurd issues in the media. In the meantime, motorways are beeing built straight through cities and no hysteric reports appear in the media. In the cities, that are subject to such motorway constructions, there seems to be both a significant scepticism and substantial reasons against these plans. Despite this, they hardly receive any media attention at all. I suggest, that those groups, that seem to be able to afford their own media campaign are not interrest groups but rather some kind of astroturfing vehicle.",0,1405212391,null,0,false,0,civu9w4,t3_2aihqu,t1_civu9w4,t3_2aihqu,null,1434687500,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

Regarding the argumentation. Your point was that the debt spike in Greece in light of the financial crisis indicates that there's something fundamentally wrong with the Eurozone. The Point is actually in terms of debt increase Greece comparatively was not worse off. 

If you're going from 100% public debt to 160% bad things happen. (as did for Greece). 

The UK, Germany and the US saw similar increases, but had way less debt to begin with. Their was enough wiggle room to survive the crisis. 

If you think comparing debt ratios doesn't mean much, that may very well be true, but then don't use it as an argument to begin with.

[further comparison](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/da/Eurozone_Countries_Public_Debt_to_GDP_Ratio_2010_vs._2011.png)

Greece does not particularly stick out when it comes to debt as %gdp development,and that was what your original post was all about.  

edit: Ireland is an interesting example, as its public debt nearly tripled. Also Ireland isn't exactly the most industrious country on this planet, still the country has finally managed to stabilize and recover.
