Ashkenazi Jewish folks are ethnically Germanic cousins, just like the Brits or Scandinavians. They clearly have the German look, and wichtigsten, the tenacious German Will. 

Combine that w/ the naturally high Jewish IQ (it's documented :http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/131053#.U0mPk_ldXAM ), and you get people like Einstein, Freud, Mahler etc. 

Most Ashkenazi identify primarily as Jewish ( esp after WW2); but they are distinctly German. Tis also why Israel bears a distinct resemblance to parts of Germany.

Qui a casa abbiamo avuto solo linea telefonica fino al 1999, per poi mandare a cagare TI per colpa delle bollette da 45.000Lire di spese e 5000Lire di telefonate.
Siamo quindi rimasti con un cellulare a testa Omnitel fino al 2006, quando ho voluto mettere ADSL.
In 7 anni però i vicini hanno praticamente costruito 4 appartamenti nel retro delle loro case usando quindi almeno la nostra vecchia linea.
Tradotto in parole povere: nessun ISP (Tiscali, Infostrada, anche i mini ISP che nessuno conosceva) che non fosse stato Telecom si rifiutava categoricamente di aprire un nuovo allaccio.
Ho dovuto ricollegare una nuova linea, fortunatamente a costo zero, con Telecom e ci son rimasto fino ad ottobre 2013 (con Linea + ADSL e nient'altro), per poi passare a Tiscali.
Con Tiscali all'inizio l'unica cosa buona che notavo era il prezzo: Telefonate incluse e ADSL 20 mega.
Solo che abitando lontano dalla centrale (1.5km) equivaleva a disconnessioni continue stando al massimo accettabile dalla linea (14mega) per colpa di un noise margin di massimo 6.20dB.
Chiamato call center, 5 minuti dopo mi abbassano la velocità a 12mega e la linea funziona più che discretamente.
Culo vuole che da 2 settimane a sta parte il noise margin è salito stabilmente a 7.50dB e non c'è stata più una disconnessione!

""Indivisibiliter ac Inseparabiliter""   
The emperor was the only one with the authority to decide if the empire should be split up, and he was under duress. Therefore, the regions breaking away was illegal.  
Their sentiments were understandable though. Not enough efforts had been made to construct and popularize an Austrian culture, rather than the culture of the different regions just kinda sitting besides each other.  

&gt;What of today's Austria?

Our politicians are incompetent, corrupt, or both. I am for a return of our emperor to the throne.   
A monarchy gives stability, and the Habsburgs have never been anything but good for this country. A monarch is also nigh incorruptible as his personal fate is bound to the fate of his realm.

&gt; In fact, both Slaviansk and Kramatorsk are in between Kharkiv and Donetsk ([map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Slov)). If pro-Russian gunmen controlled Lugansk, Donetsk, Kramatorsk, and Slaviansk, then they could have control of all the key roads in eastern Ukraine. With Russian troops in Crimea, and a massive Russian force just north of Kharkiv, if one wanted to establish pro-Russian militias inside Ukraine in order to soften the ground for an invasion with the rest of Russia’s military, this is exactly what it would look like. Furthermore, this is exactly how pro-Russian militias established control over Crimea. There was a [significant body of evidence](http://www.interpretermag.com/yes-russia-controls-crimea-and-yes-those-really-are-russian-troops/) suggesting that those pro-Russian militias were actually Russian special forces. Now there’s a growing body of evidence that these militias are too. 

Yep, capturing and controlling key spots certainly appears to be preparation for Russian invasion.

There's little evidence that these gunmen enjoy much popular support, separatism gains only marginal support in polls (e.g. [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22loex/recent_26_29_march_opinion_poll_of_people_of/)) and large [genuine pro-Ukraine protests are growing](http://i.imgur.com/IZwEoqN).


Also looks like Russia with its gunmen is aiming to capture as many key locations and cities as they can before the crucial meeting in Geneve next Thursday.

true,webhyperion,GERM,Deutschland,"Ein Vegetarier/Veganer rettet also ca. 400 Tiere pro Jahr, mal abgesehen, dass dies kein ""Retten"" in dem Sinne ist was allerdings /u/AlL_RaND0m schon bemerkt hat.

Ein Mensch in Deutschland isst durchschnittlich 30kg Fleisch pro Jahr.

Hier mal einige Zahlen der Fleischproduktion pro Tier:

Tierart;Gewicht vor Schlachtung,Fleischproduktion

Pferd; 500kg, 275kg;

Rinder; 663kg, 354kg;

Schaf; 49kg; 23kg;

Schwein; 119kg; 96kg;

Ziegen; 26kg; 13kg;

Man könnte sich also theoretisch 10 Jahre lang von dem geschlachteten Fleisch einer Kuh ernähren, mal davon abgesehen, dass das Fleisch verderben würde.

Wie kam man also auf die Zahl 400 Tiere? In dem Artikel geht hervor, dass schlicht und einfach die Anzahl der geschlachteten Tiere durch die Anzahl der Bewohner geteilt wurde. Die größte Anzahl der getöten Tiere machen wiederum Fische und Schalentiere aus, ca. 370. Das ganze bezieht sich allerdings auch nur auf die USA und ist nicht auf andere Länder direkt übertragbar. 

Ob dies Tierschlachtungen auschließt die für den Konsum für Tiere gedacht sind wird nicht erwähnt.  In den USA gibt es 83.3 million Hunde und 95.6 million Katzen welche größtenteils Fleischfresser sind und mit Sicherheit mehr Fleisch pro Jahr verzehren als ein Mensch.
Beispiel: http://www.fressen-auf-raedern.info/futtermenge.html

Ich würde behaupten die meisten Hunde in Deutschland sind eher kleinere also Cockerspaniel bis Dobermann und ein paar Größere, kommt man also auf vielleicht ca. 350gramm Fleisch pro Tag für einen Hund. Das macht 127,75kg fleisch Pro Hund pro Jahr. Ein Mensch isst nur 30kg pro Jahr. Ein Hund isst also 4 mal mehr Fleisch pro Jahr als ein Mensch.

The main cause was Slovak drive for more decisions about Slovakia to be made in Bratislava rather than in Prague. Autonomy/federation was in Slovak political program since 1918, when Czechoslovakia was founded. In my opinion, if it weren't for the forty years of centralized communist rule that didn't allow any Slovak nationalistic talk, the country would have dissolved sooner.

No Russian minority and no Russian strategic interest. Maybe if they decided to conquer the whole Europe, but even in that case, we would be invaded only because we're on the way.

This is a bit boring and predictable but hey.

We united with a bankrupted country that was a sworn enemy for countless years to form a united (!) Kingdom. Then we completely fucked over another one who (mostly) broke away to form a Republic again.

I think the most likely way the UK will come to an end is simply that it will break up into its constituent nations. If Scotland goes independent in 2016 and is even remotely successful, Wales will slowly but surely demand more autonomy from Westminster before finally seceding - it might take 50 years but it could well happen.

&gt;

&gt;__[Holocaust denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_denial)__, the denial of the systematic [genocidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide) killing of millions of [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew) by [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany) in the 1930s and 1940s, is illegal in a number of European countries.  Many countries also have broader laws that criminalize [genocide denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_denial). Of the countries that ban Holocaust denial, a number ([Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria), [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany), [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary), and [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania)) were among the perpetrators of [the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust), and many of these also ban other elements associated with Nazism, such as Nazi symbols.

The Beginning:

In the year of 1870,  in the days when a man was judged only by how awesome his moustach was, Prussian chancelor [Otto von Bismarck](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VC2oa3GRhX4/TU2ec0YGmQI/AAAAAAAAA9k/b_gD_reUVlM/s1600/bismarck2.jpg) and French Emperor [Napoleon III.](http://tomas6.szm.com/Obrazky/Novovek/Francuzsko/Napoleon_III.jpg) got into a quarrel on which souvereign could sport the more awesome beard. Napoleon III. said it was him, while Bismarck supported his souvereign, [King Wilhelm I. of Prussia](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/e/e8/1797_Wilhelm_I.jpg), who was backed by [Ludwig II., King of Bavaria](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Ludwig_II_portrait_by_Gabriel_Schachinger.jpg), [King Karl of Württemberg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Karl-W%C3%BCrttemberg.jpg) and [Friedrich I., Grandduke of Baden](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/FrederikIB.jpg). Napoleon couldn´t handle it and ordered his [Garde Républicaine du Moustache](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Neuville_Alphonse_Marie_De_The_Hussars.jpg?uselang=de) to ""show these Bosches how a real beard looks like!"". Unfortunately for him, they where no match for the german special forces of this time like the bavarian [""Bayrische Bartjäger""](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Louis_Braun_-_Bayerischer_Infanterist_Max_Lehner_Krankentr%C3%A4ger_der_Sanit%C3%A4tskompanie.JPG) or the prussian [""Schnurrbart-Hussaren""](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Prussian_hussars.jpg). Eventually, Napoleon had to give in and, as the man he was, [apologised to Bismarck](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/BismarckundNapoleonIII.jpg) and accepted Wilhelm I. as ""Emperor of the Moustaches (and Germany)"". He even went as far as to offer his modest manor in Versaille for the [crowning ceremony](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Wernerprokla.jpg). Ever since, the facial hair of a man had to be the equivalent of his social status. This, however, should also lead to the end of the germnan Empire, when [Wilhelm II., King of Prussia and german Emperor](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Wilhelm_II_of_Germany.jpg) came to power. Wilhelm, who was coursed with the ""crooked-beard""-syndrome, just couldn´t handle the fact that he would always stay in the beardy shadows of his father, [Friedrich ""Siede-Stache"" Wilhelm](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Wil2-F.jpg) and his cousins [Edward VII.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Edward_VII_in_coronation_robes.jpg) and [Nicolas II.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Mikola_II.jpg). He tried to make up for his shortcommings by building warships and railways. Wilhelm completely lost his shit when french prime minister [René Viviani](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Viviani_5126118262_30fe269c8a_o.jpg) called his moustache a ""coat hanger"". The results are known. After Wilhelms exile, the German people lost it´s ways, falling to [micro-bearded men](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-13774%2C_Adolf_Hitler.jpg) and their hate for the jewish [Payot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidelocks). When the dust of yet another war had settled, Germans had enough of beards. From then on, the people in West Germany decided on a [strict policy of non-beardedness](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundeskanzler_%28Deutschland%29#Deutsche_Bundeskanzler_seit_1949), while the people in the soviet zone of occupacion had to suffer under the dictatorship of the [Red Goatie](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-J1231-1002-002_Walter_Ulbricht%2C_Neujahrsansprache.jpg), who was backed by the [Georgian Bogeytrap](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Stalin_lg_zlx1.jpg). Then, on the ninth of Movember 1989, [The Hoff sang down the Berlin Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdKVX45wYeQ) and they all lived happily ever after with Volkswagen, health insurance and McBeetus for all.

For example, if you earn even $20 an hour where I'm currently living, 50% of your income is going towards rent. If you're earning $10.70 an hour (minimum wage) you're living with 20 other people in a house and are likely a temporary foreign worker. You simply can't afford to live here on the minimum.  You still need to eat and keep sane and get around. Essentially, if you don't go out, visit your family, have any emergencies, and your job still exists, it will still take you 5+ years to get a down-payment for a home.

Begreifen tue ich das ganze jedoch nicht. Klar war das, was die NATO im Kosovo veranstaltet hat absolut grenzwertig. Das kann man auch anders sehen. Und die Gründe für den Irakkrieg waren erstunken und erlogen. Nur wissen wir davon, weil die Presse davon geschrieben hat. So wie sie jetzt von der Annektion der Krim schreibt. Der Kosovo und der Irak machen doch die Krim nicht besser. Putin ist genau so ein Halunke wie Bush. Eigentlich noch schlimmer. Denn Bush ist jetzt weg. Putin bleibt ewig. Und in den USA dürfen Schwule heiraten. In Russland wandern sie in's Gefängnis. Von der russischen Kleptokratie mal abgesehen. 

Es gibt tiefe Sympathien für Russland und Putin in Deutschland. Aber ich habe wirkliche Probleme diese nachzuvollziehen. Oder überhaupt zu verstehen. Das Komische: Die Leute, die ich so kenne und die so ticken sind gar keine Ossis. Weit entfernt. Also nix mit DDR-Indoktrination. 

Ich vermute, dass das was mit unserem Mangel an Nationalismus in Deutschland zu tun hat. Die deutsche Seele sehnt sich nach einer ""starken"" Nation. So wie die Engländer ihr Kolonialreich haben und ihr Militär feiern. Das ordentlich auf den Putz hauen kann. Mit Atomwaffen. Oder die Franzosen. Die mit der Fremdenlegion in Afrika auch mal zeigen dürfen, wo der Hammer hängt. Wir deutschen dürfen an so etwas nicht mal denken. Vielleicht sind Putin und Russland als ""großer Bruder"" so etwas wie ein Ersatz-Führer. Mit einem Militär, das sogar den USA Paroli bieten kann.

Also you cannot legally work (as in a real job) in Spain without a work visa, so there's that....

2. Food is way cheaper than in the US and things in general are are cheaper, but obviously it depends on where in the USA you're from. On average drinks, food, housing etc is all cheaper. 

3. Travelling within Spain is cheap(ish) it can vary. Bus is by far the cheapest and the most travelled routes are cheap. Train is way nicer/faster but also much more expensive (sometimes more expensive than a flight). 

Flights within Spain are usually pretty good, check out Vueling, Ryanair, etc Flights from Granada--&gt;Barcelona just as an example run from 70-150 euro round trip (ish). 

4. Are you asking about how the raves are in Ibiza? If you're asking then you don't know anything about EDM music, it is bar-none the most absurd and over the top EDM rave experience on earth. Space &amp; Amnesia are great, avoid Pacha. Big names obviously come through ... tiesto, armin, SHM, etc etc etc I don't know about Valencia but they might have some.

5. As a general rule people do not speak English, even the general transportation people (i.e. bus ticket vendors, train ticket vendors, taxi drivers etc). So knowing some basic phrases and knowing where you're going etc will help.

You should learn Spanish, be polite, and be open to new things lots of stuff is done differently. Know that you'll feel overwhelmed, scared, homesick, and lonely at first. But you'll meet new people, love the country, and grow a lot as a person.

Mallorca is better seen on a rental car, centauro.net is offering one for 10 bucks a day. Palma is ok to stay, but being on may, you'll be happy having an hotel that is not too far from the beach and that has a little nightlife to wonder around.

Use one day to go to the villages on the mountains on the north west. Deia, Valldemossa, Soller. A night in Deia, there's this classic night bar named 'Sa fonda' in the middle of Deia,normally pretty interesting foreigners.

Use another day to visit on of the not-so-tourist-beaches, Like Es Trenc/Sa rápita, or El Mago/Portals Vells, or Es Calò des Moro.

Use another day to wonder the centre of Palma City, on the weekend is very quiet and shops only open till mid day, so try a friday. Some nice areas to wonder around during the day is the Cathedral, Plaza de España/Plaza Mayor, Plaza Cort. During the night maybe better to hit La Lonja and Santa Catalina. If it's weekend, Paseo Marítimo has the nightlife.

Use the other two days to repeat any of the above activities or

* try seeing a cave like Drach (not very exciting, bit expensive, but some tourists like that)
* Visit some touristical Areas (Magalluf has a wave house hotel, and a few clubs during the day who may be worth a few hours, Arenal has also few german party beach clubs, Cala D'or has few shops).
* Visit a classic Market, like Santa María, organized once a week. Google should help you. 
* Do a Hike. Sa Forada or LaTrapa are by the mountains and both offer beautiful views and landscapes.
* Enjoy a bit of beach volley. Palma Nova features a lot of it, plus has an italian cool chiringuito by the beach, 'il chiringo' that hopefully will be open at night time by May, with some Djs and stuff.


To Stay... it all depends. An hotel at the city will be pretty boring at night, but if you are a mountain type of person, try an Hotel in Palma, are the cheapest probably, and it's central. 

Tourist locations are more 'alive' and hectic at night, always more entertaining, not very typical Majorca, tough. The north offers normally cheap prices than the south, there's a big complex-city-of-rooms called Vellevue. It's far, but has beach, it's on Alcudia.

Santa Ponça, Palma Nova and Magalluf, on the south, also offers hotels, but I'm afraid they won't come cheap by May. Arenal has also hotels, cheaper, but is not as nice, is an ugly-city-by-the-beach. However, it's central.

Any further questions, I'm sure there will be some, drop me a PM. Probably other redditors here in Majorca have some other tips to add here. ",0,1397346747,null,0,false,0,cgqwrkj,t3_22ufam,t1_cgqwrkj,t3_22ufam,null,1433328686,2,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,2

The Huns roll up a bunch of nomadic tribes, including Bulgars, and all of them move West into Europe. Attila dies. The tribes spit. Khan Kubrat forms the Bulgar Khanate known as Old Great Bulgaria north of the Black Sea. After Kubrat dies, his third son Asparukh marches westward, settles north of the Danube, and forms an alliance with the Seven Slavic tribes. After it loses some important battles against the Bulgarians, in 681 the Byzantine Empire recognizes the creation of the new Bulgarian state and is obligated to pay annual tribute.


Bulgaria's future is grim. Never mind the entrenched corruption, which does not seem likely to end any time soon. Demographics are destiny.

(2) You absolutely can speak your mind. If you spoke about democracy or socialism in the 1800's, you'd likely be executed, deported, or imprisoned. People calling out bigotry is not even comparable to the state systematically suppressing dissenting opinions. In democracy today, we can have this discussion with no fear of state intervention - not so in the days of monarchs. Freedom of expression doesn't mean freedom from criticism.

(3) How is public healthcare a part of a Nazi state? You think paying for the population's health and giving people a higher life expectancy is somehow related to death camps? Public healthcare long predates the Third Reich.

I'm also fascinated that you believe the market is less free today than in the distant past. Modern-day governments are basically controlled by economists - in the past they were controlled by nobility and aristocrats who had no idea how to manage an economy. Not to mention that ""ein Euro"" is everything that a free market could want - standardized currency. The biggest supporters of a common currency and market are economists. I don't see why you think a free market would arrive at many inward-focused national economies with their own currencies. The Euro is a hallmark of free markets.

There is a limited number of ""Sparpreis""-Tickets available up to three days before the date of travel.

Since somebody mentioned the tickets like ""Bayernticket"": *Technically* you could maybe travel cheaper if you could find a group of people which use the Bayern Ticket. You would still have to get to the Bavarian border first using a second ticket (IIRC Kahl (Main) was the first stop in Bavaria).

What's happening in the West is a secularization, not an Islamification.

I put it in a graph and if it continues like this, by the time every British citizen is either Non-religious or Muslim, 83% are Non-religious and 17% are Muslim. This point is reached in 2021. Those numbers are a reliable approximation.

A notable size but hardly a problem. Especially when the 17% is the total Muslim population and not the total Criminal or Extremist Muslim population.

There would be differences of course; Poland would probably be smaller, for one thing. Elsaß-Lothringen would be in German hands. Depending on the terms of the treaty concluding this alternate WWI, more of Eastern France may or may not be part of Germany today.

O2 bought E-Plus so they will be one big major carrier but that is working through regulatory bodies so will still be years away.

Every other provider is a Virtual Operator.

LTE is only on contract so that is good that you don't need that.  You are screwed for data if you aren't on a contract.

If you want good coverage and service then I would go with O2 or Vodafone.  http://www.o2-freikarte.de/  http://freikarte.vodafone.de

I personally am with T-Mobile but they are overpriced for what I get.

A thing to note is that whilst most services are ""Internet-Flat"" like the two I suggested above, they actually do have restrictions.  The O2 and Vodafone deals above include 200MB.  After this you are capped to 64k and 32k respectively.  64k is bearable but I couldn't imagine being capped at 32k for the rest of the month.

true,OWKuusinen,FINL,"Terijoki, Finland","&gt;This should have been obvious though -- even if they said they were neutral, the fact that both countries are liberal democracies with capitalist economic systems and a strong affinity for western culture makes it fairly clear whose side they were really on.

I'm a Finn. I don't really know much about what Sweden did during Cold War, but the above quote is so radically wrong I have to strive to correct it.

The Finnish system might have been de jure liberal, but it surely wasn't so de facto. 

Capitalism and society in general were heavily regulated, state was a heavy investor and owned big chunks in all important companies. The state controlled the economy very strongly with disallowing lending from outside the borders, controlling the currency and economic policy to to keep the work cheap and banks in check. Foreign ownership over 20% was seen as dangerous and heavily discouraged (save Soviets, who owned and ran Soviet companies in Finland, such as Teboil). 

We had all the right wing parties in opposition for the whole Cold War and people who encouraged liberal values didn't do well in politics.  If they did, they were excluded from all important positions post-elections. The state policy was toward social homogenisation till 1990s.

Soviet Union was the biggest trading partner with 20%-25%. They shipped us stuff like crude oil good -10% of the market price, which we could then turn into petrol and sell forward with good overhead. This meant that Soviets had a big grip on our economy as well (similarly as they did in Ukraine till few months ago) and top of all even ran companies in Finland (such as the petrol-station chain Teboil), meaning that they weren't just selling stuff to Finland, they were also BUYING stuff in Finland.

Further, by late 70s most important political, economic and journalistic operators had a ""kotiryssä"", their personal connection to the Soviet political system with which they did faustian bargains for more or less good reasons, leading on macro-level to Finlandization.

It didn't help that in Finland president Kekkonen had ruled the country with iron hand for decades and probably looked like an extremely suave self-serving dictator from Soviet viewpoint (what with their arranged elections). I'm fairly sure that from Soviet perspective this all meant that (1.) economically and politically we were deeply in their pocket and (2.) our system was closer to Soviet system than American system and (3.) Kekkonen was in it for himself and (4.) the population loved the Soviets.

All this made them blind for stuff like our integration to EFTA in the early 1960s and creating diplomatic ties not just to Warsaw countries but to NATO countries as well. It's also worth mentioning that if USA had lost the Cold War, you could have written that ""it's incredible that Americans thought that Finland was a liberal democracy just because you could buy Coke"". The whole policy was designed to make both blocks feel like they were more symphatised by the elite.

* **The fall of ruble and hryvnia as well as uncertainty in Ukraine in general heavily affects some Latvian companies**, namely those that mostly export to CIS. For example many producers of canned sprats are working just to fill warehouses and might fire all workers once it's done as sprats exports to Ukraine have stopped completely and are severely decreased to Russia.
  
* **Satellite TV provider Viasat (MTG) has refused to follow media watchdog (NEPLP) ruling to ban Russia's RTR Rossya** claiming that since it's not registered in Latvia, but in Sweden, NEPLP have no authority over them. NEPLP insists that it does. Viasat instead is going to address RTR themselves to ask that they consider the concerns the watchdog has, but won't cancel their rebroadcasts regardless.  
  
* Meanwhile Viasat's parent company, **media concern MTG has a conflict with the leading cable operator Lattelecom**. Basically, MTG refused to renew contract about their main national channel TV3. They asked for slightly increased payment to which Lattelecom refused and thus TV3 is no longer available to many cable subscribers. (TV3 used to be the most popular channel for a long, long time... until MTG demanded state funding to which the state disagreed and thus MTG dropped its channels from the free-of-charge national digital broadcasting service.. where Lattelecom has monopoly, but that was in January)  
Right now MTG is airing commercials asking people to break their contracts with Lattelecom cable services. Those commercials include footage of consumer rights watchdog's spokesperson who is not amused by this. MTG claims they can do it as it is not actually a commercial, but a PSA. Right now it has turned in quite the clusterfuck. It's worth noting that MTG owns nearly all commercial television stations in Latvia.  
  
* **A women tried to sneak drugs hidden in dumplings into prison**. She had 9 dumplings and the drugs reportedly were marijuana, ecstasy, heroin, meth and cocaine, so, yeah, must have been quite the recipe.
  
* **Food and veterinary department has asked consumers to avoid buying drinking water with the brand ""Marina diētiskais ūdens""** (dietetic water). The label of their bottles claim various health improving effects, but the department is concerned that the distribution company can't explain from where that water is imported. The department is also concerned that the distribution company has been buying lots of empty PET bottles and corks lately... which is fishy since there is no production sites registered to their name.
  
* **State police published [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPP4ct3u3rY#t=277)** about how they transported and distributed Euros in preparation of currency change last year.  
  
* **A man kidnapped his ex-wife and later committed murder-suicide**. Both were 35 and had children. The gun was stolen from his step-dad's safe.  
  
* **Hockey goalie Kristers Gudļevskis became the first to play in ECHL, AHL, the Olympics and NHL in the same season**. He debuted in the NHL on Friday night playing for Tampabay and got 1st star of the match title.  
  
* One of the most prominent persons of Liv (Livonian) ethnicity, **folklorist and former MP Dainis Stalts passed away** yesterday morning. It's worth noting that there are less then 200 people who identify as Livs left, less than that speak Livonian, and the last native speaker passed away [last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeEgxHEpL2w#t=61).

Also, I have come to the conclusion that those issues might not even be all that malleable to radical change within the timescales of political cycles. These things are cultural, [maybe even genetic to an extent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajnal_line); Southern Europe, for instance, is today more corrupt and dysfunctional than the north, just as it was for centuries beforehand, but that hasn't stopped them from converging to almost-German/British development levels.

* What am I supposed to do to make money considering I don't know Spanish? (Planning to learn of course, but for the time being)

That's a tough one. Your best chance would probably be teaching english privately, as everyone has said. I know a guy that has an academy and has employed American people without a work visa before, I'll ask him. When are you coming? September semester? Full year?

* How expensive/inexpensive are things in general in Spain?


Cheaper than in the US. Alcohol (beer mostly) is also really cheap


* How expensive is travelling within Spain and between other European countries?

Very cheap.

For travelling within spain you can use theese websites [Amovens](https://www.amovens.com/es), [Blablacar](http://www.blablacar.es/) and [carpooling](http://www.carpooling.es/), people basically post the trips they are making in the near future, you get in contact with them, pay them something (less than bus, wich is the second cheapest way of travelling within Spain) and you just go with them. Don't worry for the language, I've done a lot of theese things with foreigners and it's okay, just say beforehand that you are American in case the driver doesn't speak any English.

* For those who know about EDM, how are the raves? I know Ibiza there is huge for clubs with house music and whatnot, but do they have big name DJs coming in often, and EDM music festivals often? Very important to me since it's a big part of my life.

Well, I wouldn't say that EDM is a big big thing here (sadly), but there's definetly a couple of good clubs to go to. Best one is probably [""La3""](https://www.facebook.com/la3valencia?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts). And on [Mya](https://www.facebook.com/MyaValenciaOficial?fref=ts) the days that they bring DJs from Ibiza are pretty cool, the other days...not so much xD
We have a lot of festivals here, this summer I'm seeing Krewella, Armin Van Burren, Knife Party, Afrojack, Aoki, etc. The biggest festivals are on summer though

* Anything in particular I should know so I don't embarrass myself or put myself in a difficult situation?

This is a big thing, if you are speaking with a Valencian, don't say that Valencian and Catalonian are the same. Don't say that they are completely different things either. You should avoid that topic. It's a very delicate subject that can get you in some trouble if you are speaking with the wrong guys. I personally don't give a fuck, but I've seen americans say ""Oh yeah, I've been learning Catalonian"" and some Valencian frowny faces. Basically there's a lot of people saying that Valencian is a catalonian dialect, and a lot of people saying that valencian is a different language. And some of them are pretty....susceptibles.

There's a bar here called ""Portland Ale House"". Native english speakers go there tuesdays and wednesdays, sit in a table and speak with spanish people, in echange they get three free beers for helping out. It's a great place to meet new people, drink free beer (for the natives) and practice some english (For spaniards). Food there is REALLY good too. Very ""American"".

""Los Quintos"" bar. This is a group of bars (all in the same street, same owner) in the students area. It's right next to the Soccer field, so if you go there just ask any young guy you see for ""The Quintos"" and they will know where they are. Everybody knows where they are.
It's a great place because there's very very cheap beer (half a litre for 1 euro), it's always full of (drunk) students and there's a really good mood overall.

*Post-elections*

* After almost a week's waiting, the final votes of last Sunday's elections (those casted at embassies and people voting in Hungary but away from their homes) were counted which confirmed what everyone was 70% sure about before: [Fidesz held on to its 2/3 supermajority](http://www.bbj.hu/politics/fidesz-kdnp-in-landslide-victory-retain-2-3-parliamentary-majority_78088) and will be making decisions on their own, entirely as they please for the next 4 years again. They are exactly at the limit with 133 out of 199 mandates won, and the decisive voting district was won by 60 votes by the Fidesz candidate. The new Assembly looks like this: Fidesz 133, Left Alliance 38, Jobbik 23, LMP 5.

* [Jobbik improved their result](http://www.politics.hu/20140408/vona-jobbik-now-strongest-euro-skeptic-national-party/), but that could be partly attributed to the lower turnout, their share of seats is lower than before. Overall they set radical goals for themselves which they all failed to meet, but later they were giving slightly positive evaluations of their results. Still, I'm not fully on board with the international media outcry that happened on the matter, we aren't a neo-Nazi state now and we certainly weren't before when they had a larger share of the seats. Longer pieces by international sources on the matter, Haaretz's is especially misinformed and silly: [1](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/09/us-europe-farright-special-report-idUSBREA380IU20140409), [2](http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/1.584450)

* All ""losing"" parties criticized the new voting system, which allowed Fidesz to take supermajority with only 45% of the party votes. Their response basically was ""If we were in England it could've been worse, we would've scored over 180 seats"", which is quite telling of their approach to power. In turn, the [international observers also criticized how the campaign was conducted](http://www.politics.hu/20140408/osce-fidesz-had-undue-advantage/), calling it unfair, but noone, other than butthurt, high school senior Jobbik fans who deluded themselves into the possibility of victory, [questioned that the elections were free](http://www.politics.hu/20140408/electoral-system-passes-test-says-cfr/). Merkel [advised caution](http://www.politics.hu/20140411/merkel-tells-orban-to-use-large-majority-soberly-and-sensitively/) in her congratulatory letter to Orbán, which was pretty much the opinion of every foreign country as well. 

* [The Leftist Alliance is deciding who to actually send to the Parliament.](http://www.politics.hu/20140408/composition-of-left-wing-parliamentary-group-yet-undecided/) Former PM Bajnai confirmed what many suspected before: [he will not be an MP](http://www.politics.hu/20140410/bajnai-not-to-sit-in-parliament/), and instead will be ""the opposition outside the Parliament"" for the next 4 years. [Analysts questioned how the Left will perform in the coming years](http://www.politics.hu/20140411/analysts-see-possible-annihilation-of-hungarys-left/). 

* [The new Parliament will be formed by early May](http://www.politics.hu/20140408/new-parliament-to-be-formed-in-a-months-time/). Many shuffles are expected with only a few current ministers retiring or getting sacked.

*Politics*

* [A diplomatic delegation made a very standard visit to North Korea](http://www.politics.hu/20140408/foreign-officials-hold-talks-in-north-korea/), but because of its timing, people were making jokes about how they actually went on a study tour and such. 

* EU took our pálinka! To arms, Magyars!!! One of the first people-pleasing moves of Fidesz after they took power in 2010 was to allow tax-free distillation of fruit spirits for personal use up to 50L a year. This move was criticized by EU from the very beginning and now they concluded their analysis on the legality of it: [it is not in accordance with EU laws](http://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2014-04/11/content_32059885.htm). For now, it has became a shouting competition with Fidesz and Jobbik crying Brussels is stepping over us and that we are a colony. 

* EP elections campaign was started with parties announcing their lists, but like before, not many people will care about it. In 2010 the turnout was around 37% and I believe it will be even lower this year. The Leftist Alliance broke up as planned and the parties will run individually.

*Economics*

* [The number of young Hungarians leaving the country is up by 50%](http://www.politics.hu/20140408/number-of-young-hungarians-leaving-country-rises-by-half-since-2000/). Compared to 2000, so this isn't a particularly meaningful number. 

* We aspire to be the little engine that can. [We might ship gas to Ukraine if the Russian supply is cut off for them](http://www.politics.hu/20140411/hungary-can-transport-max-6-bn-m3-of-gas-per-year-to-ukraine/). From our own supplies, which we received from the Russians. 

* [Trade surplus is up by 118m€, 80% of exports go to EU](http://www.bbj.hu/economy/trade-surplus-up-eur118-million-yoy;-80percent-of-exports-to-eu_78220).

*Misc.*

* Works on the German Occupation memorial started this week to the [dismay of leftist](http://www.politics.hu/20140410/protests-continue-at-occupation-memorial-site/) and [Jewish figures](http://www.politics.hu/20140409/mazsihisz-shocked-at-construction-of-german-occupation-memorial/). Fidesz [told them to stop](http://www.politics.hu/20140410/left-and-right-extremists-should-stop-street-aggression-over-german-occupation-statue-says-fidesz-mp/), because criticism is not nice. 

* [A room in the European Parliament is proposed to be named after deceased Socialist PM Gyula Horn](http://www.politics.hu/20140411/socialists-dismayed-at-christian-dems-opposing-ep-room-to-be-named-after-horn/), and the Christian Democrats (basically the appendix of Fidesz, legally a separate party running in coalition with Fidesz) are opposed to it. 

* Orbán [donated his 2006 World Cup rucksack](http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2014/04/11/orbans-rucksack-enters-national-museum/) for the National Museum's contemporary collection. 

* Back in November, an exemplary eco-farm in operation for over 20 years lost their land lease contracts to Fidesz-friendly people, many with no connections to agriculture.

* They increased **taxes on divorces** (I shit you not). Once the tax was voted for, 2 of the 3 parties who voted in favour immediatly renounced the law (I'm still not shitting you). The tax is popularily known as a misery tax.

* Flemish-nationalists and conservativists (N-VA) announced their fiscal program, which appears to be very neo-liberal. On the other hand, they are at least very open about their program on fiscal issues on federal level. On regional, flemish level they stay rather quiet.

* The soap around our **royal family** continues. Rumours about the youngest brother (prince Laurent) of the king who tried to commit **suicide** (officially it's pneumonia). The rest of the ultra-catholic royal family is very mad but tries (miserably) to hide this. The old King who resigned last year didn't visit his son Laurent for 2 weeks in the hospital. The Queen Mother even wrote a passive agressive open letter about prince Laurent.

* Universities are a bit scared about a European Citizen's Initiative that wants to **restrict stem cell research**.

true,FleshyDagger,ESTO,Estonia,"&gt; Most countries don't have a requirement of a citizenship test for those born of a population that has been present in the country for a considerable length of time. 

Nor does Estonia.

&gt; Those that had citizenship under the previous Estonian SSR (even if this state came about by occupation and illegal means initially) should not have been made stateless upon independence due to the language they spoke and where they or their parents came from.

Your assumption that people are being treated differently because of their language is foolish and incorrect. Such discrimination is forbidden by the constitution.

Secondly, you don't seem to have a practical understanding of what being stateless means. After the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia declared itself the legal successor state of the Soviet Union. Only written application was required to receive Russian passport. Many chose not to do so because of the perks that stateless status gives. For example, both the EU and Russia allow stateless persons to enter without visa, whereas having either Estonian or Russian citizenship would limit visa-free travel to either Schengen area or Russia. The stateless also don't have to go through mandatory military service, and have many other freedoms that citizens of either country don't have.

The only significant limitation of being stateless is that they can participate on all elections but Estonian general elections. For most of them, this isn't worth giving up all the perks.

&gt; Russian isn't even a recognised regional language where the majority of the population do speak it natively.

6. Amanda’s other stories were no less suspicious. The day after the murder, she told the police she’d spent the entire evening and night at Raffaele’s apartment and had no idea who had killed Meredith. A few days later (under severe pressure, she insists), she told the police she’d been home after all, had invited Patrick Lumumba in, and that Lumumba had killed Meredith. The next day, in an entirely voluntary statement she wrote with no one else present, Amanda said she was pretty sure she’d been at Raffaele’s after all but nonetheless stood by her recollection that Lumumba had killed Meredith. A few days later, Amanda still remembered having been at Raffaele’s apartment, but now she was certain that Lumumba had nothing to do with the murder. (How Amanda could know anything about Lumumba’s guilt or innocence was unclear, of course, once she’d returned to her claim that she’d been at Raffaele’s apartment the whole time.) Unfortunately for
Lumumba, Amanda only told her mother this. Both Amanda and her mother neglected to mention it to the authorities, even though Amanda said they knew there was no evidence against Lumumba except Amanda’s accusation. Lumumba languished in jail for over two weeks until he came up with an airtight alibi. After Lumumba was released, Amanda said she felt terrible that the police had wrongly arrested him.

 ********************************

The clean-up and body-move were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and the judges and juries that convicted Amanda also determined that she had staged the “burglary.” Though it's possible Amanda was not the person who did those things (and also possible she was not the person who locked Meredith’s door after the murderer left Meredith’s room), inferences reasonably drawn from the clean-up and cover-up evidence, together with the ample evidence summarized above (and other physical evidence and testimony not mentioned here), solidly support the murder conviction. The burden shifted to Amanda long ago to answer the tough questions posed in this imaginary monologue:

Amanda, it’s clear that someone cleaned up after Meredith was murdered. Someone also cut off her bra and repositioned her body – to make it appear, we think, that she’d been raped. We think that person also staged a burglary so it would appear the murderer hadn't been let in by someone who lived there. Even if a burglary actually happened, as you insist, who in his right mind would risk drawing suspicion on himself by cleaning up after the murder, or by moving and covering Meredith’s body? And if he did bother to clean up, why would he ignore his own bloody footprints? Why would he pause to lock Meredith’s door with a key, and yet leave the front door wide open? It's difficult to believe you weren't involved in the clean-up and body-moving, or why you might have done those things for an innocent reason. The killer would have no reason to have done them. Obviously Meredith didn’t. No one suggests your two out-of-town roommates came back and did all this, or that a stranger wandered in off the street and did it. Who does that leave?

You, with or without Raffaele’s help. We found your DNA, mixed with Meredith’s DNA, in five different places around the cottage – including even Filomena’s bedroom, where you insist a burglary occurred. We didn’t even find Filomena’s own DNA in her bedroom, much less any trace of a burglar or anyone else – just your DNA, mixed with Meredith’s. You’ve also told several different stories about where you were that night. Sometimes you were home, sometimes you weren’t; sometimes you’re not sure. Sometimes you invited Patrick Lumumba into your cottage and he killed Meredith, sometimes you didn’t and Patrick had nothing to do with the murder; sometimes you’re not sure. Sometimes you insist Guede broke Filomena’s window and climbed in; sometimes you say Meredith must have let him in; sometimes you’re not sure. And so on. Maybe you had nothing to do with this gruesome murder, Amanda, but, frankly, we doubt seriously that you’ve told us all you know about what happened that night. Maybe it’s time you did. Better late than never.

true,tokyoguyjean,null,null,"PART 2 OF 3:

There is evidence of a great deal more than just a clean-up and body-repositioning. Just a few examples:

 

1. Despite the clean-up, Amanda’s DNA, mixed with Meredith’s blood, was found in five different spots in three different locations (bathroom, hallway, Filomena’s bedroom). Some was visible to the n@ked eye; some was revealed by Luminol.

 

2. Raffaele’s DNA was found on Meredith’s bra clasp. Although this is undisputed, defense lawyers blamed it on ""contamination"" (the bra clasp had lain on the floor of Meredith’s sealed-off bedroom until six weeks after the murder). But even if the evidence-collectors had sneezed on the bra clasp, and 47 different men had touched it that night, and it had been trampled by 1,000 wild horses and chewed by 98 rabid dogs in the six weeks before it was collected, no amount of contamination could have caused Raffaele’s DNA to materialize on Meredith’s bra clasp. Most Knox supporters nevertheless rely on this ""contamination"" argument to insist that no DNA of Amanda or Raffaele was found in Meredith’s bedroom.

 

3. The prosecution also argued (and the courts that convicted Amanda and Raffaele agreed) that the bloody bath-mat footprint was “consistent” with Raffaele’s footprint (though it may not have been his), and could not have been Guede’s or Amanda’s. The defense disagreed: it was Guede’s, they said. It seems that Guede’s right shoe (but not his left shoe) had come off during his scuffle with Meredith. Guede postponed his escape to wash off his right foot, which was covered with blood even though it managed to leave no footprint until Guede reached the bath mat.

For one reason or another, Guede chose not to wash off his bloody left shoe, which seems to have had a mind of its own. It left no shoeprints in the bathroom while Guede was washing his right foot, choosing instead to leave an unbroken string of bloody shoeprints in a direct line from Meredith’s bedroom to the front door. Guede’s bloody left shoe did pause once, however – just after leaving Meredith’s room, so that Guede could lock Meredith’s door from the outside. He must have done this by reaching behind his back with Meredith’s stolen room key, since Guede’s bloody shoeprints all point toward the front door, indicating he never turned around to face Meredith’s door after he'd left her room. The prosecution argued, more plausibly, that it wasn’t Guede who locked Meredith’s door – after all, he was careless enough to leave the front door wide open. Instead, Amanda or Raffaele had locked Meredith’s door after the murder, enabling them later to explain why they hadn’t discovered Meredith’s body sooner.

 
4. Amanda’s fingerprint-free bedside lamp was found on the floor at the foot of Meredith’s bed. Knox supporters say Meredith must have borrowed it without asking (Amanda said that Meredith had never asked to borrow it). Skeptics suggest the lamp was brought in to help illuminate spots to be cleaned, and was inadvertently left there when the clean-up was finished. All we know for sure is that Meredith’s room ended up with extra lighting that November evening, while Amanda’s bedroom was left with no light at all (Amanda’s room had no ceiling light – only her bedside lamp).

 

5. Amanda’s “morning after” story raises eyebrows. She testified that she came home that morning (November 2) to find her front door wide open and blood in the bathroom that hadn’t been there before. She called out to her roommates, but no one answered. She thereupon closed the front door but knowingly left it unlocked, and took a shower. When she finished, she realized she’d left her towel in her bedroom. She used the bath mat – on which she’d just noticed a bloody footprint – to “hop,” dripping wet and naked, back to her room to get her towel. Rather than dry off in her room, she ""hopped"" back to the bathroom, still wet and n@ked, on the same blood-stained bath mat, and dried off there. After returning to her bedroom, now dry but still naked, Amanda dressed, and then blow-dried her hair in the other bathroom. There she noticed an unflushed toilet (which she left unflushed) containing what turned out to be Rudy Guede’s f3ces. Though Amanda said all of this puzzled and worried her, she didn't notice that Meredith's door was locked, and she walked right past Filomena’s bedroom – at least four times – without looking in and discovering the “burglary.” Filomena's door was closed, Amanda said, and she didn't try to open it. Yet Raffaele said that when he and Amanda returned to the cottage about an hour and a half later, after breakfast, Filomena’s door was “wide open” when they walked in, and he immediately noticed the “burglary.” Neither Raffaele nor Amanda claimed to have wondered who had opened Filomena’s door in the meantime.

Even worse, recently Amanda made yet another change to her story:

Court testimony – June 12 2009
Amanda: ""I used the mat to kind of hop over to my room and into my room, I took my towel, and I used the mat to get back to the bathroom.""

true,tokyoguyjean,null,null,"PART 1 OF 3:

On the day after her murder, Meredith Kercher’s blood was found in many places in her bedroom and on a bare right-foot print on the bathroom floor mat. But no footprints were found in the 10-foot-plus stretch between those two bloody locations – all hard-surface floors in the bedroom, hallway and bathroom. In addition, after she died, Meredith’s bra had been cut off, and her body had been moved and repositioned – to make it appear she’d been raped, the police speculated. Finally, her body had been covered with a comforter. No one knew why, though various theories were offered.


This is undisputed. Although the prosecution’s “staged rape” theory was speculation, the defense, far from challenging it, took it a step further, arguing that Meredith indeed had been raped and then killed by Rudy Guede, acting alone. Guede’s DNA was found in several places in Meredith’s bedroom, including inside her body. Amanda and Raffaele could not have been there, the defense insisted, since none of their DNA was found in Meredith’s bedroom (other than Raffaele’s DNA found on Meredith’s bra clasp – more on that below).

 

Granted, Meredith’s bedroom was right next to the bathroom. But it would have required at least a 10-foot leap, with a 90-degree turn near the end, to reach the bloody bath mat from the bloody areas of Meredith’s bedroom without touching down somewhere in between. And whoever made that 10-foot leap-and-turn obviously didn’t mind leaving a bloody footprint on the bath mat when he landed. It doesn’t matter here whose bloody footprint was on the bath mat. The blood in both Meredith's bedroom and on the bath mat indisputably was Meredith’s. That’s all that matters here. What accounted for the blood-free 10-foot gap? 

A 10-foot leap-and-turn? Or perhaps the person had a blood-free left foot, on which he hopped to the bathroom so his bloody right foot wouldn’t leave any footprint along the way. When he got there, despite his careful effort to avoid leaving a bloody footprint, he stepped on the bath mat with his bloody right foot. One can imagine other possibilities, but only one stands out as plausible: More bloody footprints were made on the hard-surface floors between the two bloody
locations, but those footprints were cleaned up.

In other words, there was no 10-foot leap-and-turn, no 
blood-free-left-foot hopper who inexplicably changed his mind upon arrival and left a bloody right footprint. Originally there was blood in Meredith’s bedroom, a bloody footprint on the bath-mat, and bloody footprints on the hard-surface floors in between. Those bloody footprints were cleaned up. The bloody stain on the bath-mat was more stubborn and could
 only be diluted (just as Raffaele later described it). 

 
Whoever cleaned up the bloody footprints may also have moved and covered Meredith’s body – or at least knows who did. The question is obvious: Who did these things, and why would that person take such a risk?

If you came home to find a bloody murder had been committed there, would you say: “I don’t think I’ll call the police just yet. First I’ll clean up this bloody mess, reposition the victim’s body and make some other changes so it appears she was raped, and then cover her up. Sure, the police may find out about the murder from someone else, in which case they might show up and be suspicious because I’m destroying and altering evidence of a murder that I'll claim to know nothing about. But that’s a risk I’m willing to take. I just can’t stand to leave such a mess, or to leave a dead body lying in that particular position – uncovered, no less.”

Utterly implausible? I think so. Yet it’s all but certain 
that such a clean-up and body-repositioning occurred. So, again, the questions are: Who did these things, and why would that person take such a risk?


Then there’s the “burglary” in Filomena’s bedroom. Both courts that convicted Amanda concluded she had staged it, 
and Rudy Guede was not even charged. Amanda nevertheless insisted a burglary actually happened and that Guede was the burglar. That is how Guede had gotten into the house, Amanda claimed, though sometimes she speculated instead that Meredith had invited him in (an alternate explanation that naturally makes one wonder who the “burglar” was). 

 
In any event, the “burglar” was not convincing. He allegedly threw a 10-pound rock through a window 13 feet above the ground (which Meredith apparently didn’t hear), scaled a 13-foot wall in plain view from the street, climbed through the broken window without disturbing any of the broken glass spread across the windowsill, threw clothes out of Filomena’s closet onto her bed but then decided not to take anything
(including jewelry, a digital camera, and a laptop in plain sight), went to Meredith's room and raped and killed her, and then ran out the front door, tracking Meredith’s blood along the way. Broken window glass was found on top of items thrown onto Filomena’s bed – on top – suggesting her window had been broken after her room was ransacked, not before. The “burglar” left no DNA, fingerprint, footprint, mud, grass stain, or any other trace in Filomena’s bedroom, on the windowsill, on the outside wall, or on the ground below. No one's DNA was found in Filomena’s bedroom – not even Filomena’s – except for Amanda’s DNA, mixed with Meredith’s blood.

 
Once again: Who carried out this real or staged burglary, and why?

Il y a tellement d'inexactitudes que bon... Alors que je suis d'accord avec certains aspects de ce que tu dis, il me semble que tu rejettes beaucoup trop la faute sur le ministère. Comme si les syndicats et les profs n'étaient pas consultés pour les réformes, comme si les grèves répétées n'avaient pas pour but unique de maintenir un rapport de force plutôt que de défendre le projet éducatif et les enseignants, comme si ne rien faire valait mieux que d'essayer de transformer un corps en crise.

&gt;si les prof résistent, c'est peut être aussi parce qu’il y a une reforme tout les ans.

On ne peut que changer les contenus parce que les syndicats refusent catégoriquement qu'on puisse faire des évaluations de ce qui se passe dans les classes ou des méthodes d'enseignement. 

&gt;Essaye de dire aux gendarmes on vas vous faire bosser un demi jour de plus, non pas de hausse de salaire, c'est pour l’intérêt commun, ils seraient tous dans la rue et avec raison.

Déjà ils n'ont pas de droit de grève. Ensuite une journée pour un gendarme, ça correspond à 24h de travail puisqu'ils sont d'astreinte. Aucun rapport avec la situation des profs. 

&gt;Par ailleurs c'est aussi assez magique la façon dont on considère que les prof n'ont absolument rien sur les programmes ou la façon d'enseigner. Encore une fois, dans les autres domaine professionnel c'est considérè comme raisonnable de consulter les premiers intéressé. 

Avec près d'un million de profs, c'est impensable de demander l'avis de chacun sans en faire une synthèse. Mais ce que veulent les profs, c'est un bâton de maréchal dans leur propre classe, ce qui est plutôt incompatible avec des objectifs gouvernementaux et/ou nationaux. 

&gt;Quand a tes finalité claires, c'est un beau vœux pieux, mais c'est pas réaliste.

Bah non, c'est très réaliste. Un outil, ça sert à quelque chose. Je vais pas visser avec un marteau ou percer avec une tondeuse. Je vais pas faire des philosophes d'un tas d'analphabètes. C'est peut-être aussi le problème n°1 de ce ministère. Entre les sympa type Lang et les tortionnaires type Allègre, il est tellement politisé pour des raisons évidentes qu'on ne sait pas ce qu'il fait ou ce qu'il doit faire. Ce n'est pas un ministère de l'égalité sociale, ce n'est pas non plus un ministère de l'emploi, encore moins un ministère de la théorie du genre ou un ministère de la réécriture historique. 

&gt;c'est pas d'une grande reforme don on a besoin, c'est de calme. qu'on laisse l’éducation tranquille le temps qu'elle digèrent les dernières reformes.

Autant je comprends le besoin de continuité et d'un temps de mise en place, autant je trouve qu'une attitude de ""calme"", ça ne correspond pas du tout aux contraintes et aux tendances actuelles. L'attentisme, c'est le plus sûr moyen pour l'EN de se faire laminer par les itérations successives d'outils toujours plus performants qui vident progressivement l'école de son utilité. 

&gt;Et la tes évaluations et ta pédagogie cohérentes tout au long de la scolarité s’installeront plus ou moins en douceur. 

J'ai quitté l'école il y a quelques temps donc je ne suis plus à jour mais il me semble que des outils s'installent progressivement. Je suis convaincu que fondamentalement, on ne peut faire mentir des évolutions de long terme basées sur des données fiables. Contrairement à des chiffres imprécatoires comme le taux de réussite au BAC ou celui du chômage.

I'm only commenting this because this underlines the biggest fault of the current Russian political leadership...

Approx 75% to 80% of the Russian Federal budget comes from oil and gas revenue when counting the service sector to the figure as it is also largely funded by it alone, gas and oil directly contribute 50% to 60% of the federal budget. The reason why Russia has been able to become more developed is because of oil and gas revenue, but this isn't real development. What is there left is you take all the oil and gas revenue away? Not much.

Another thing to note is that the only reason Belarus hasn't collapsed and sinked even lower than Ukraine is because Russia supports the regime with both funding it directly and giving it discounts in oil and gas prices. There is no development at all in Belarus, with out Russian support it would be more poorer than the worst parts of Ukraine.

Comunque, il problema e' reale e molto grave.

Il bug e' presente dal 2011 e segnali di possibili attacchi ci sono da circa 1 mese. 

Quindi, potenzialmente un attaccante puo' aver recuperato gli account piu' importanti della tua vita online: Google, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, Pinterest e forse home baking e chissa' cos'altro (guarda le liste).

Quindi, sempre potenzialmente, questo attaccante puo' usarle come meglio preferisce.

Per questo l'unico modo per stare sicuri e' cambiare tutte le password che possono essere state potenzialmente rubate.

Io vi consiglio anche di attivare la [two step verification (o verifica in due passaggi)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-step_verification) che in pratica aggiunge un ulteriore controllo, successivo alla password, per permettere il login. In parole povere, su computer/cellulari non miei, se voglio loggarmi su Google devo inserire nome utente e password e dopo mi viene chiesto un codice random che cambia di continuo (tipo quelli delle banche) che viene generato da un'applicazione sul cellulare (o in alternativa che ricevo via SMS). In questo modo o un'attaccante mi ha rubato sia nome utente e password che il cellulare o rimane comunque fuori.

---

&gt;__Two-step verification__ (also known as Two-factor authentication, abbreviated to TFA) is a process involving two stages to verify the identity of an entity trying to access services in a computer or in a network. This is a special case of a [multi-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) which might involve only *one* of the three [authentication factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication_factor) (a knowledge factor, a possession factor, and an inherence factor) for both steps.    If each step involves a different authentication factor then the two-step authentication is additionally two-factor authentication.

&gt;Do you suggest any specific places for pintxos?

The best are, without any doubt, the ones served at bars in the Old Town. Pintxos, similarly to Spanish tapas, are associated to bars and not so much to bigger restaurants, and just like everywhere else in the Basque Country, the Old Town has probably the best places. The traditional thing is to visit several different bars in a row, and in each have a pintxo or two and some wine. This is called *poteo*. 

It's matter of exploring and finding the best places. There's everything from [traditional on-bread pintxos](http://viajes.chavetas.es/albums/mipais/donosti03.jpg) to some others very carefully prepared and with plenty of different ingredients. 

&gt;We are also looking forward to the seafood

The Basque coast is very well known for its seafood, Basques have been renowned fishermen for over a millennia. Dishes like *[merluza a la vasca](http://static.hogarutil.com/archivos/201105/merluza-en-salsa-con-guisantes-y-almejas-xl-668x400x80xX.jpg)*, *[marmitako de bonito](http://www.braisogona.com/uploads/thumbs/Recipe/1024_1024/35/marmitako-bonito-a-la-manera-tradicional.jpg)*, *[bacalao al pil pil](http://www.solococina.es/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Cocina.png)*, *[chipirones (squid) en su tinta](http://estudarespanhol.ponmeaprueba.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/chipirones-en-su-tinta-con-arroz-blanco.jpg)*, and many, many others. You'll find plenty of restaurants specialized in seafood (both Basque dishes and other Cantabric ones too) all across the Basque Country, but especially in cities like Donostia and Zarautz. Basques are also avid meat eaters, so you won't find any shortage of it. 

Some other minor things you should try are *[txistorra](https://eu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitxategi:Chistorra.jpg)* (Basque chorizo), *txakoli* (Basque white wine) and *[Idiazabal cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiazabal_cheese)*. 

&gt;The order of the trip looks like Barcelona -&gt; French Basque someplace -&gt; Donostia -&gt; Zarautz -&gt; Bilbao -&gt; Madrid, just FYI

Follows a logical order, so it's ok. Between Zarautz and Bilbao, following the coast road is [Gaztelugatxe](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Gaztelugatxe_4199995260.jpg), which I think it is worth making a quick visit, it is very scenic.

Ich würde aber ziemlich stark zwischen den aufgelisteten Einwänden, und dem Beispiel Lichtverschmutzung differenzieren - meine Begründungen:

1. ""Eingriff in die Ordnung Gottes"" - besteht aus Aberglaube und _argumentum ad antiquitatem_, also eine rhetorischer Fehlschluss.

2. ""Nutzt nicht allen"", ""ist vielen gleichgültig"" - erstens wirtschaftlich falsch (Strassenbeleuchtung senkt statistisch nachweisbar sowohl Kriminalität als auch Verkehrsunfälle, deshalb besteht darin Nutzen für alle), zweitens basiert auf einer subjektiven, philosophischen Ansicht der Natur von Steuern, drittens verwechselt ""Gebühren""  und ""Steuern"".

3. Aus medizinischer / physiologischer / soziologischer Sicht absolut lachhaft.  ""Gasausdünstung"" produziert keinen Feinstaub (wenn schon, dann hätte der Autor sich über die Produktion aufregen müssen, die im 19. Jahrhundert oft dreckig und ineffizient war).  CO2 ist absolut ein Thema, aber in Absentia elektrischer Beleuchtung, ist Gas ziemlich die sauberste Beleuchtungsmöglichkeit.

4. Eine ganze Mischung logisch falscher Argumente, subjektivem Glaubens, und nochmals soziologisch fragwürdiger und schwer nachweisbarer Behauptungen

5. ..""Pferde scheu"" ...häääh?  ""Diebe kühn"" - falsch.  Z.b. [diese Studie](http://campbellcollaboration.org/lib/download/223/) weist nach, dass Strassenbeleuchtung in den USA und UK konsequent Kriminalität um ca. 21% verringert

6. Nochmals völlig absurde Behauptungen, basierend auf Vorurteilen.  An diesem Punkt ist der Teil meines Gehirns, der sich mit Logik befasst, schon [echt nur noch am Spucken](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-24Go6YjUBVQ/UCR882fr6QI/AAAAAAAAA78/_jYIO9BYPuI/s1600/misc-jackie-chan.jpg).

Lichtverschmutzung und allfällige Schlafstörungen sind, im Gegensatz, klar messbare Phänomene.  Da hat's keinen Aberglauben, keine Nostalgie, kein Dirigistischen so-sollten-sich-die-Menschen-verhaltenismus.  Öffentliche Policy hat zum grössten Teil auf der Suche nach dem grösstmöglichen allgemeinen, ganzeitlichen ökonomischen Nutzen zu basieren, und nicht auf irgendwelchen Vorurteilen.

Klar sollten wir nicht über die Ignoranz und Abergläubigkeit unserer Vorfahren zu fest grinsen, da, wer weiss, in 100 Jahren unsere Nachkommen vielleicht dasselbe über uns tun werden. 

Ich in mir jedoch ziemlich sicher, dass zumindest unsere Akzeptanz der wissenschaftlichen Methode und empirischer, statistischer Messungen zur Nachweisung gewisser Phänomene und um einiges besser platziert, einigermassen anständig fundierte Annahmen zu formulieren als dieser Firlefanz.

Lastly, if Berkut or Internal forces during Euromaidan were to shoot at protesting babushkas who stood before them, you could accuse Euromaidan in using human shields as well, because they stood between protesters and Internal forces (even if it was metaphorically speaking).

If the program worked, it would completely circumvent MAD, so the Russians were forced to spend a fortune to try and catch up, let the US develop an unchallenged first strike capability. Trying to bridge the gap collapsed the Soviet Union. 

The SDI program (Star Wars was a pop culture name) was completely impossible though, it was a complete bluff. So the Soviets tanked their economy on a bluff.

That's the story we hear in the US a lot at least. Ronald Reagan has achieved an almost mythological status in some circles here.

Let me see if I understand the whole situation:

* Spanish parliament rejects the referendum, basically because the central government are a bunch of cunts.
* Referendums are illegal under the Spanish constitution.
* Catalonia is legally stuck, within Spain.
* Meanwhile Scotland get's a proper referendum on becoming an independent country.
* If the yes in Scotland wins, I believe that the EU will trigger the proper mechanisms for accession. (Correct me if I'm wrong on this one)

J'aime bien Eldin reporter pour cette même raison: il déambule dans les couloirs de l'Assemblée, dans les meetings en confrontant les politiques à l'image qu'ils donnent: certains répondent sérieusement en ressortant les éléments de langage habituels et ils ont le droit, mais Eldin le souligne, d'autres font dans l'humour (Balkany encore la semaine dernière et aujourd'hui qui dit que c'est bon l'immunité parlementaire), certains laissent entendre ce qu'ils pensent réellement d'untel ou untel (Esther Benbassa ""il est souple, il se faufile toujours Placé"" :) 

C'est clairement une émission faîte pour parler de la forme plus que du fond, mais on a déjà beaucoup d'émissions dans lesquelles ils viennent expliquer leurs idées, leurs programmes, avec novlangue et langue de bois. 

La séquence sur leur look est aussi intéressante quand on nous montre qu'untel a arrêté de porter des montres hors de prix et l'a remplacée par une flik flak, qu'untelle s'est prise des réflexions sexistes parce qu'elle portait des robes, que le jean de Duflot a fait polémique alors que c'est pas forcément le cas à l'étranger, que certains se sont convertis au made in france, que plusieurs d'entre eux copient le look de Miterrand quand ils vont comme des moutons sur sa tombe ...

Il y a aussi une séquence réseau qui parfois en met certains clairement mal à l'aise.

Là Placé a accepté de se faire suivre alors qu'il connaissait l'émission et qu'il est déjà venu il me semble, pensant que ce serait sa semaine: manque de bol il n'est pas entré au gouvernement, manque de pot on lui ressort une casserole, comme on le fait pour tous les invités. Il dit qu'il a déjà donné tous les éléments en janvier et que ça suffit alors que manifestement cette affaire ne serait pas réglée, il n'avait qu'à s'expliquer sereinement.

No, I'm not. Russia/USSR has a long tradition of placing political pressure, making threats, sending military aid, forming guerrillas and militias, but direct invasions are always their last resort and is certainly not something they even need in Crimea.

They have a huge part of the Crimean population supporting Russian integration whether we like it or not, they don't need to invade anybody, the jobs is already done for them and they have a plethora of willing men to serve them from Crimea whenever they snap their fingers.

In fact, let's just put aside any and all Russian military personnel you claim are present in Crimea. Hypothetically, they're beamed up to the ISS and are no longer present.

Le fait de réduire les épreuves du bac, ""d'organiser un examen moins onéreux et plus typé sur les dominantes des élèves"" me semble également une très mauvaise idée, j'ai vu plein d'élèves en Angleterre qui clairement n'avaient pas assez de connaissances, en étudiant plusieurs disciplines celles-ci se nourrissent les unes des autres alors que réduire à 3 ou 4 matières à un âge où on ne sait pas forcément quelle orientation on va prendre entraînera encore plus d'inégalités dans l'accès au supérieur. (sans parler de sa volonté de baisser le coût de l'examen: j'ai assisté à des épreuves du GCSE et du A level dans lesquelles les conditions strictes normalement pour un examen national de la sorte n'étaient pas respectées: on dit qu'on donne le bac en France, et ben j'ai été effarée de ce qui se passe là-bas). Ce que j'aimerais qu'on importe de l'Angleterre: avant tout le travail en équipe, il est théorique ici et pas du tout réel dans les faits. C'est beaucoup une question de culture (d'ailleurs l'article posté par gallais sur les heures de travail mentionne un peu ça). Leur formation des profs laisse clairement à désirer mais elle est plus pragmatique, plus pratique, alors qu'ici on est très très théorique. Ils sont beaucoup plus accompagnés à leur début, tandis qu'ici on est lâchés seuls d'un coup et la charge de travail est énorme en comparaison. Voilà pour l'essentiel.

Yes it was. It was one of Woodrow Wilson's most important goals. When the German Empire knew the war was lost they started to pursue democratic reforms to get a better peace deal. The more liberal Max von Baden was appointed chancellor even before the sailor's mutiny triggered the revolution. 

&gt;After the Russian Revolution of February 1917 had hastened Tsarist despotism to its end, Woodrow Wilson and the Western Allies had begun to proclaim that the war's principal aim was to make the world safe for democracy. Once Ludendorff and the Reich leadership concluded that the war was irremediably lost, they therefore advocated a democratization of the Imperial German political system in order to improve the likelihood of reasonable, even favorable peace terms being agreed by the Allies.

also slightly more expensive ie (€4.50 for a 30 minute dry but it gets them properly dry, compared to 3€ at placa del sol) but if you get the reloadable card (have to buy a one off €20 credit after that you can load it with €5) it drops down to €4.

In Australia, where I lived and worked in a restaurant for a while, I only could find the white and blue label, and to my confusion sometimes it was labeled ""Peroni"", sometimes ""Nastro Azzurro"". I heard they wanted to market it abroad as ""Nastro Azzurro"", but switched back to ""Peroni"" when people started calling it by a not very nice nickname: ""nasty"". I tried both these beers and they both tasted like a regular Italian ""Peroni"": I'm pretty sure they were just a regular Peroni rebranded. I guess elsewhere it's the same thing.  

What was funny to me, as other people pointed out, is that in Italy Peroni is a popular cheap beer that you drink with friends, but abroad it was marketed as a pretentious, classy Italian beer, and it was very expensive -- were I worked at was sold at double the price of (imho) way better tasting Australian beers.

I hope this clarifies it a bit. As you can see the reviewer in your video was confused too, and he too says that its taste is exactly the same as the one he called ""peroni blue"".

To add even more confusion Peroni does have a special beer, ""Gran Riserva"", called [Peroni rossa](http://www.birraperoni.it/cms/uploads/news/Peroni-Rossa-50-cl.png), which is actually a red beer and it is completely different from classic Peroni or Nastro azzurro.",0,1397411332,null,0,false,0,cgreix1,t3_22wv6p,t1_cgreix1,t3_22wv6p,null,1433337254,4,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,4

We now have one of the strongest far-right parties in Europe - if not the strongest: Jobbik. They won 20% of the seats of the new legislature. They're your typical Eurosceptic chauvinist whiners who, more likely than not, are financed by Russia and/or Iran. They complain about the EU being a newer version of the ""evil empire"", even though most people know they're Russian puppets - hilarious, right?

It must, however, be said that nothing of this sort happens without reason. From 2002 to 2010, when the centre-left Socialists were in power, the country practically became impoverished with rampant corruption on all levels of government. Buildings were rotting away in the capital even though the EU allocated specific funds for their restoration, begging the question: where did the money go?

The point is, people grew tired of the onslaught of corruption maintained by that government, and Socialists in Hungary were historically associated with Jews - which is why many (though NOT ALL) Jobbik supporters are also anti-Semitic. They see Jews as the people who control the money supply and cut off Hungary on purpose just because people won't cater to their ""Zionist scheme"".

I wouldn't remotely put Jobbik on the Golden Dawn Level. They're becoming more mainstream with each election, meaning they'll have to give up their most radical views or perish in the political environment.

into a new and ominous phase. Shooting was
reported on April 12th in Kramatorsk and
Sloviansk, two towns in which disciplined,
armed and uniformed men seized control of
police buildings. Arsen Avakov, Ukraine’s
acting minister of the interior, accused
Russia of “an act of aggression”.
No troops have crossed the border in the
conventional military sense but what is now
playing out across the east, including the
seizure of the interior ministry building in
Donetsk, appears co-ordinated and has the
hallmarks of a Russian operation. Men have
appeared in unmarked uniforms as they did
in the run up to the annexation of Crimea in
March. Roadblocks are springing up. Pro-
Russian forces now control the two main
roads from Kiev to the east.

In the Donetsk interior ministry, uniformed
members of the Berkut, the riot police force,
which was officially disbanded following the
fall of the government of president Viktor
Yanukovich in February, are in control. On
the morning on April 12th the local interior
ministry chief was forced to resign. A new
one has been appointed but a source in the
police station said that he was out of the
country and had promised to return by
Monday.
As night fell, masked men were strolling in
with bags of food, bottles of water and boxes
of biscuits. Posters of the so-called Donetsk
Republic declared by pro-Russian activists
who have held the city’s main administration
building since April 6th had been sellotaped
over the police insignia on the walls.
Answering the question of why policemen
had switched sides, Vitaly, who would only
give his first name, said: “We were on this
side from birth”.
Citizens of Donetsk, which is an
overwhelmingly Russian-speaking city, are
going about their business as usual. On
Saturday there were only a few hundred
gathered by the barricades in front of the
administration building. No one seemed to
think that war was coming or that there was a
significant risk of one.
No one appears to be laying in stocks of
flour, oil and the other staples people usually
buy when there is a fear of war. Tamara
Budkovska, a 57-year-old handing out
newspapers in front of the occupied
administration building, said that there would
not be a war, “because the Berkut is with us
and the police is with us”. She added that
Americans in uniform had come to Donetsk
but had “refused to attack us”. Russia’s media
is now engaged in what is regarded by
Ukrainians as a fully fledged disinformation
campaign, the main thrust of which is that
the new government in Kiev is one of
“fascists”.
If Russia’s aim was to provoke major
uprisings in the east, to provide an excuse to
intervene militarily or force federalisation on
Ukraine, that has failed, at least for now.
Instead, a new phase has begun which is
following a pattern similar to that seen in the
run up to the annexation of Crimea.",0,1397416252,null,0,false,0,cgrgldb,t3_22wxzf,t1_cgrgldb,t1_cgrgjdi,null,1433338228,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Of course, I'm not saying that the west is the main cause for the problems in Ukraine, but our governments have made some choices that could have been done differently with a better outcome. For instance: the west could have pushed for parliamentary elections soon after the deposition of Yanukovych, but it didn't, possibly because how things were turning out seemed advantageous at that point; it could have defended the right of Crimeans to self-determination and help create a favourable environment for a democratic referendum, but instead European leaders either kept silence or publicly denied that right, which gave Putin a golden excuse for the invasion.

This is pretty much the answer here. I'm Russian myself. Sometimes, not necessarily on this subreddit although rarely there's a slip up, Russia, in a political sense, i.e. the Russian government tends to mean ""all Russians"" to some, leading to misinformation. I've seen this generalisation at the start of the whole homophobia thing, where people talking about all Russians as homophobes, intolerant, etc. Now, it's all Russians painted with a broad brush as Putin supporters, xenophobes, homophobes, and Crimea annexers due to the recent affairs. I believe this is done unintentionally in most cases, e.g. due to poor wording, though an occasional dickhead here and there would mean it. I guess that's how it feels for people when their home country of USA, China, etc. is generalised the same way, with millions of people suddenly painted the same colour.

/u/lOwl97  e /u/sEdivad , la mia casa ha almeno 300 anni (come prova, è disegnata su alcune cartine del 1700equalcosa in mostra in una vecchia chiesa nel mio comune), le abbiamo trovate mentre toglievamo la malta vecchia del muro del garage/ex-stalla durante il lungo processo di restauro delle parti non abitate della casa.

Le abbiamo fatte stimare e, da sinistra verso destra, ecco un riassunto del foglio di descrizione che ci hanno dato:

- **5 Franchi ""Sitzende Helvetia"" 1874** della zecca di Bruxelles (circa 1400000 pezzi), argento 900/1000 dal peso di 24,90 grammi (in origine 25,00). Valore per un esemplare mediocre 275$, per uno splendido fino a 590 CHF. Il bordo è zigrinato.

- **5 Franchi 1868 Napoleone III** della zecca di Strasburgo (oltre 12000000 pezzi), argento 900/1000 dal peso di 24,85 grammi (in origine 25,00), valore per un esemplare mediocre 15$ o 80 franchi francesi. Sul bordo è stampata la scritta ""DIEU PROTEGE LA FRANCE"".

Come dimensioni, entrambe sono sui 32 millimetri. Le ho fatte valutare nel 2001 e il valore è il prezzo con cui sono stati venduti esemplari simili riportato su alcuni cataloghi, come il ""World Coins - 1994"" e il ""Credit Suisse"". A richiesta posso scansionare e carica la valutazione completa, ma non stasera che lo scanner mi funge solo sotto linux...

Ironia della sorte, dopo aver postato questo link stamane ho trovato nell'orto una moneta (in rame a giudicare dall'ossidazione verdastra) in cui si distinguono le scritte ""Vittorio Emanuele II Re d'Italia"", ""1867"" e ""2 centesimi"". L'altra moneta è in mio possesso da lungo tempo: un ""Buono"" da Lire 1 datato 1924 che ho trovato (non ricordo in che circostanza) purtroppo forato e che porto sempre con me nel portachiavi. Queste sono più piccole, quella di rame è grande circa come una moneta da 5 centesimi, mentre il buono poco più di una da un euro.",0,1397418216,null,0,1397418886,0,cgrhfwl,t3_22x20f,t1_cgrhfwl,t1_cgr86hf,null,1433338629,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5

The netherlands, however, were at the other end of the spectrum. We had reserved seats from Amsterdam to Dortmund, but when we arrived in Utrecht they announced that the train was taken out of service. From there, we took another train headed for the German border, which was also taken out of service, this time in Deventer. After waiting for half an hour, we found a third train, heading into Germany, which, guess what, was taken out of service, Enschede being our place of misery this time. We ended up crossing the border by bus, getting off att the closest commuter train station, Gronau, and enjoyed a nice, eventless ride to Dortmund with DB.

Denke auch die Historie hat den in dem Punkt Sozialdemokraten schon Recht gegeben, das sollte man sich dann schon eingstehen.

Marx' These aus seinem *Kommunistischen Manifest*, der Kapitalismus würde die Mittelschicht abschaffen (und in die Arme der Arbeiterpartei treiben) hat sich rückblickend als falsch erwiesen.

Der ""Kapitalismus"" (eigentlich ""das deutsche Wirtschaftssystem"") hat die Mittelschicht nicht verkleinert, ganz im Gegenteil.

I think Right-Wing Extremist parties and worldviews are the biggest threat to Europe.

However, in the politcal sphere in Germany, they are weaker than one could expect.

There is the 'Alternative für Deutschland', a new conservative party, they almost got into German parliament. Luckily, they are now fighting each other and there are even streams within the party that are very much tea-party-ish. The other, national socialist 'NPD' is almost irrelevant for federal elections, but they still are in some state parliaments.

They are smart bastards. Consider their whole organization as a marketing agency. Initially, their first main base was the hardcore nationalists (mainly from the capital).

Before them, there wasn't anyone saying, yeah 14-17 year old student, we will make your future better, simply because they couldn't vote before the age 18. This generation is now able to vote, and have been manipulated by their propaganda like paying famous Hungarian Youtubers to attend their rallys. 

The northeast part of the country means easy votes as well. Even tough, they wont publicly accept, that they promise people to (get rid of) 'solve' the minority problem (excuse my words, its hard to find the right expressions without being innacurate:(), where conflicts between 'social groups' occur on a daily basis, they have a big advantage. 

I wouldn't say that they have no opposition, even the other right-wing party (Fidesz) is actively 'fighting' against them.

true,globaltyler,GERM,Germany until further notice,"That's great for you. But from my experience it looks like you were just incredibly lucky with Deutsche Bahn.

Let me tell you about commuting with Deutsche Bahn, meaning taking 4 different trains operated by Deutsche Bahn each day 5 days a week:

Last Monday I arrived at the train station and the Intercity train I take to work because there is no real alternative (there is a ""Regionalbahn"" every hour which stops at stations that sometimes are only 2km's apart, which means it takes 2 times the time) wasn't running. The Regionalbahn which should have left 5 min before I arrived was announced to be 20 minutes late. Which meant I had to take the car because otherwise I would have been at least 30 minutes late for work.

This is the 6th time an Intercity train (either to Frankfurt or back) was not running in the one month I've been commuting.

If the Intercity *is* running, the one in the morning is usually 5 minutes late once it a. 1-2 a week it's 10 minutes late. I think once in the month in question it was on time.

If I take the Intercity back at 6.20pm, it is always on time. Which is no miracle since it starts in Frankfurt. But god forbid, I'd knock off an hour early to be home a bit earlier, I've done that each friday so far and without fail each friday the 5.20pm Intercity runs late. 30 minutes last friday.

Then we get to the S-Bahn. Which is run by Deutsche Bahn. I'm not talking about the total train wreck (pardon the pun) they did with the Berlin S-Bahn, I'm talking about the Frankfurt one.
In the middle of peak hours at Frankfurt main train station (lower levels) there are sometimes 10 minute gaps between trains on my platform. There are 3 lines running my direction (goes towards the fair) and on the busiest station in Frankfurt at the busiest time and sometimes (especially when there's a fair on) they can't get proper schedules, all I hear each morning is ""Information on S3-4-5 to wherever, departure some time 5 minutes past, today delayed by about 5 minutes"" (which usually turns out to be more close to 7 or 8 minutes).

While I was on a working holiday in Australia, I had (among others) a part time job for the Department of Transport of Victoria as a public transport surveyor. I spent lots of shifts counting passengers on the Melbourne public transport. Additionally we always had to note down the actual arrival time of each train. And I can tell you, they were on time a lot more than in Germany. Also the price for a public transport pass (in a country as expensive as Australia) was about half of what you have to pay here.",0,1397424897,null,0,false,0,cgrk8zz,t3_22xh59,t1_cgrk8zz,t1_cgrit4f,null,1433339952,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"&gt;60% bis 250% vom mittleren Einkommen von 1600€ netto. Von 960€ oder von 4000€ leben ist schon ein kleiner Unterschied.

""*für einen Alleinstehenden*""

Für gewöhnlich beziehen sich die 60% bis 250% aufs mittlere [Nettoäquivalanzeinkommen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84quivalenzeinkommen), is natürlich für jede Lebenslage *(verheiratet? Kinder?)* unterschiedlich. So kenne ich das zumindest.

Deshalb sei gesagt (ich bin so frei/faul und zitiere einfach):

&gt;Das Äquivalenzeinkommen ist das Einkommen, das jedem Mitglied eines Haushalts, wenn es erwachsen wäre und alleine leben würde, den gleichen (äquivalenten) Lebensstandard ermöglichen würde, wie es ihn innerhalb der Haushaltsgemeinschaft hat.

Wenn du also ne Familie hast (=2 erwachsene Personen idR), dann musste die 1600€ verdoppeln und kommst gleich auf 3200€ als 100% des Durchschnittsnettoeinkommens für die Familie.

60% ist halt die Grenze der **unteren Mittelschicht** zur **Armutsgefährdung**. (heute sagt man gerne ""Prekariat"")

Wär in nem 2-Personen-Haushalt aber auch wieder 1920€. Wird also denke ich erst mit mehreren Kindern wirklich schwierig und eben armutsgefährdet.

Folgerung:

Die interessante Frage ist, ob diese Summe bei Einfachverdienern oder Doppelverdienern zustandekommt. Und demnach ob man es sich überhaupt leisten kann, **alleinstehend** mit ca. 1000€/Monat rumzukommen. Grenze zum Prekariat halt.

____________________________

Jedenfalls wie mans dreht und wendet, in Wikipedia stehen ja die Zahlen.

""Der Kapitalismus"" hat uns einfach reicher gemacht und in der Produktion ne relativ solide Mittelschicht hervorgebracht, wo er natürlich die Handwerkermittelschicht kaputt gemacht hat. Overall snid wir einfach reicher, das kann man halt nicht von der Hand weisen.

Selbstverständlich kann sich da aber durch unproportional hohe Einkommen für die Oberschicht immer noch ein Graben auftun zwischen dem Mittelstand und der Oberschicht. Is aber n andres Thema.
