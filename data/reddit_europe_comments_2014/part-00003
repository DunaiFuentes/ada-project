Vienna/Wien was a the seat for the Hapsburgs for a long time, steeped in long historical importance - much to see and do. Churches, cathedrals, palaces and just a beautiful city.

Potsdam - similar to Vienna but the home to the Hohenzollern. Very close to Berlin so no need to overkill on the history.

Those two with Rome should be the biggest destinations on my list. The history of the HRE is long and complex, any particular time that interests you the most, what about any events?

America, beyond a doubt, **needs**, I can't stress this enough, **needs** a better safety net in the form of more social benefits. This is a given and something we must strive for. But Europe's problems arn't from capitalism, and I don't believe, and don't want to believe, it's from their social welfare economies either. I don't know what the problem with the Eurozone/European Union to be honest, but just look at the facts: 

America, which is more capitalist *per se*, is WAY better off than Europe at the moment: 

 [America came out of the recession four years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Great_Recession), the European Union did as well, but had [a double-dip recession](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/15/eurozone-double-dip-recession) shortly afterwards, [which it only exited from last August](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/13/eurozone-exit-double-dip-recession). In short, we *(America)* still have years of growth *(albeit small)* while Europe as a whole still has years of recession/loss looming over it's head. We've reached pre-2008 levels last year IIRC, but Europe still has a long way to go before it regains the ground it's lost.

Plus, America had a [GDP growth of 2.5%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23881928) last year, compared to the European Union's [GDP growth of .2%](http://rt.com/business/eu-gdp-q3-eurostat-707/). Hence our economy is growing at something like 12.5x that of Europe. And IIRC, we're even projected to surpass the European Union's economy by 2020.

Unemployment wise, the European Union has a [unemployment rate of 10.9%](https://www.google.com/search?q=European+Union+unemployment+rate&amp;oq=European+Union+unemployment+rate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5239j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8) and the Eurozone, as evidenced by this very article, an unemployment rate of [12.1%, which is projected to go up to 12.3 percent](http://www.dw.de/oecd-predicts-record-eurozone-unemployment-for-2014/a-16953636)  by the end of the year. The United States has [a unemployment rate of 7.3%](https://www.google.com/search?q=United+States+Unemployment+rate&amp;oq=United+States+Unemployment+rate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5218j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8), which also by this very article, is projected to [fall below 7%](http://www.dw.de/oecd-predicts-record-eurozone-unemployment-for-2014/a-16953636)  by the end of the year.

2. You can ask, but don't expect anything. They're pretty strict, even if its just for getting a drivers license for a fork lift (which is somewhere between 200 and 300 eur). They might put you into some kind of job-creation measure though. Which i personally would turn down, unless it's something that from your point of view is practically useful.
3. I don't think its a problem registering residency whereever you're going to reside at the point you're coming back.

All in all, expect a lot of problems with the Jobcenter, as they're from my experience mostly incompetent. While it may not be the most attractive alternative to the Jobcenter, try to get a job as helper by applying at several time-work agencies. Sadly, there are not that many alternatives as unskilled worker, unless you're looking into starting an apprenticeship, which i would personally recommend.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"I wonder, what kind of jobs is the US creating?

Surely there are some good manufacturing and high-tech jobs, but many of them are things like part-time work at Walmart.

I've been reading news like [this](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/17/us-usa-economy-poverty-idUSBRE98G0PN20130917), and it doesn't make me feel confident about our economic system.

Quotes from the article:

""Although the bulk of the more than 8 million jobs lost during the downturn have been recouped, many of the jobs have been in services industries such as retail and restaurants that typically do not pay well.""

""The number of U.S. residents living in poverty edged up to 46.5 million last year, the latest sign that an economic recovery marked by a stock market boom has not trickled down to ordinary Americans.""

I agree that the US needs a better system of government services, especially educational and health services (e.g., guaranteed health care), but those things aren't happening.  In fact, the government is currently cutting food stamps and, last I checked, basically ending unemployment benefits.  Obamacare is one good reform, but it is only good in comparison to what existed before (e.g., insurance discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions).

We have a political system that is hamstrung by the Republicans, who are a terrible political party from the standpoint of trying to improve the US economy and especially the quality of life enjoyed by ordinary people.

And how much does it cost to get an education these days?  The debt that students assume is astronomical, yet an educated workforce is perhaps the thing that the US needs the most.

I just don't see it as a sustainable system long-term, nor do I see the austerity in Europe as sustainable over the next century.  Consider that automation is increasingly sophisticated and will take many more jobs.  Amazon is even considering using machines to deliver parcels.  Supermarkets are using machines instead of cashiers.  Will teachers eventually be replaced by online classes?  Medical technicians by machines?  All manufacturing jobs filled by robots?  Even if only some of those changes occur, the loss of jobs will be extreme, and they won't merely have moved elsewhere.  They'll be gone forever once robots become cheaper than outsourcing work to Bangladesh and China. Something major has to change.

I'll expand a bit on it here. Given the sheer number of Chinese characters, their range of pronunciations in different Chinese languages (e.g. Mandarin and Cantonese), and the historical absence of a standard transcription scheme (it's only in recent decades that there's been some effort to standardize the transcription of new foreign words, primarily in the mainland), there were practically limitless possibilities, and in fact many foreign names are rendered differently in different Chinese-speaking areas. Examples: 

Bosnia and Herzegovina - 波斯尼亞和黑塞哥維那/波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那 *Bōsīníyǎ hé Hēisāigēwéinà* in the mainland and Hong Kong, 波士尼亞與赫塞哥維納/波士尼亚与赫塞哥维纳 *Bōshìníyǎ yǔ Hèsāigēwéinà* in Taiwan (和 *hé* and 與/与 *yǔ* both mean ""and,"" the latter is just more formal and bookish)  
Maldives - 馬爾代夫/马尔代夫 *Mǎ'ěrdàifū* in mainland and Hong Kong, 馬爾地夫/马尔地夫 *Mǎ'ěrdìfū* in Taiwan  
New Zealand - 新西蘭/新西兰 *Xīn Xīlán* in the mainland (新 *xīn* = ""new""), 紐西蘭/纽西兰 *Niǔ Xīlán* in Hong Kong and Taiwan 

In the case of the U.S. there were two short Chinese names, 美國/美国 *Měiguó* (literally ""beautiful country"") and 米國/米国 *Mǐguó* (""rice country""). 美國 won out in Chinese (and Korean), but 米国 is still used in Japanese (*Beikoku*). Some older Chinese texts write of 米國 and some Chinese netizens use it in a sort of jocular or dismissive way. 

This happens with personal names too. Someone else in this thread brought up Beckham's Chinese name. In fact Beckham has three Chinese names: in the mainland he's the four-syllable 貝克漢姆/贝克汉姆 *Bèikèhànmǔ*, a somewhat unwieldy name that's used because Standard Mandarin doesn't allow *k* or *m* at the end of a syllable. But Cantonese does, so in Hong Kong he's the two-syllable 碧咸, which is *Bìxián* in Mandarin but the reasonably accurate *Bikhaam* in Cantonese. Taiwan usually transcribes foreign names based on Mandarin pronunciations, but they're not really sticklers for accuracy, so there he's the three-syllable 貝克漢/贝克汉 *Bèikèhàn*.",0,1388823930,null,0,1388826402,0,ceh09zi,t3_1u9byo,t1_ceh09zi,t1_ceg7shz,null,1431793354,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

You're right, we need to make changes, but we're on a much better foundation to make those changes than Europe is. Which is my point. And hence why I think capitalism itself is not so much to blame for this, yes, unchecked capitalism, but not just capitalism. It goes deeper than that, it has to, because I'm no economist, but if this was the case, I would think that Europe's social welfare economies would be on a much better footing than the American economy if it was purely about different levels of capitalism, but this isn't the case as evidenced by my other post.

Despite being heavily automated already, farming still requires a great deal of human labour and oversight. How can the government justify a non working class while people still have to break their backs in sectors like food production, care and drug testing?

I also find the idea of automated doctors a potential disaster. It takes all responsibility out of the carers hands and makes the patient legally vulnerable in the event something goes wrong, not to mention the fact machines can be tampered with. 

Meanwhile I'm also very uncomfortable with having machines fill the void of lawyers and judges given that their subject matter deals in interpreting right from wrong. Computers are aids to help us manage our work better. There are moral questions to be asked about ceding control of the legal system to them.

If you want to have a better idea of what will happen when self driving cars, self serve shops and cleaning services better than crappy little roombas take off and achieve public acceptance, it'll simply result in a crisis. Governments don't subsidize their jobless adequately or correctly as it is.

The big reason that the Euro isn't working is that they have only monetary integration, and no political or financial and to diverse economies.  Think of the USD, how much is the federal tax- 25 %? Or the former D-mark. To get proper integration one essentially have to pool the debt, do massive transfers north to south and essentially give up a lot of the national state. Think of when West Germany took over DDR- they have transferred trillion, took over their pensions and social systems, debt, banks and trillions in investments. That is what needs to happen. However, the people in the north are not about to do this. They do not want to. And frankly, I do not know if the south is so keen on giving up their states as well. We are taking about the end of a lot of national states essentially. If Finland has to pay off Greece's debt, Portugal pensions and send 30% of their GDP south- well that will change everything for the Finns. And they will say no. 

So, despite knowing how to fix the Euro, it will not happen. They do not want to fix it. 

As for a union outside of the Euro. Well, that would be Sweden, Denmark, UK and Eastern Europe. I don't really see great enthusiasm for that from our viewpoint.

Secondly, I think you also vastly underestimate just how little a family can earn in countries that are a stones throw away from here for doing back breaking labor, and that it's ENTIRELY feasible and financially logical for those families to uproot and move here to receive government benefits, free health care and an improved standard of housing. I certainly don't blame the ones that do come over if they can. I would and so would you. We also don't address the fact that many ethnic Germans also ""abuse"" the system as well, with no ambition to get out of H4 in their lives.

It doesn't know what it wants to be in my opinion, which means it's trying to be two things it can't be at the same time, a loose confederation &amp; a consolidated supranational union.** 

I mean, with the European Union, it's almost as if nobody's at the wheel. How are you supposed to move towards an *""ever closer union""* when you're constantly adding new members every year at different stages of integration and with different levels of motivation *to* integrate? And how do you plan to consolidate not only them, but already-present members, in the middle of a economic crisis? It just seems like a seriously flawed short-term strategy, and a very uncertain long-term strategy. 

Some of the most successful economies are outside the Eurozone however, namely Poland, Sweden &amp; the United Kingdom *(in that order)*. But all have differing financial philosophies from the European Union *(at least it looks that way looking from the outside in)*, and in the case of the United Kingdom, political philosophies as well *(don't know much about Poland and Sweden in this regard)*. 

What I'm trying to say, is maybe it might be easier to convince the Northern states to carry the weight of the South states if the European Union was more centralized. If it had less members, perhaps it wouldn't have as much resistance to extending the European Union's sovereignty at the cost of the Eurozone members national sovereignty, which I think, although this is merely a opinion, would help in responding to crises.

And maybe the nations outside the Eurozone would have more room to maneuver financially and politically without the E.U. redtape. 

Honestly, I would love to see a consolidated European Union with all of the present members, but at the rate it's going, I just can't see the Eurozone surviving or remaining stable with the present state. The European Union needs a massive overhaul, and like you pointed out, the Eurozone states realize this, they just arn't willing to do it.

I don't know to be honest. I'm not a expert on the European Union or a economist. But the European Union can't consolidate any further without working this shit out. 

Personally, I think if they want to keep all members in the European Union, they have to move towards a looser confederation where the E.U. is going to have to have less authority and less prominence on the political/foreign politics scene, but every move made by influential members in the E.U. and it's leadership seem to point out that they have no intention of doing this, which like I said, reminds me of a car with no driver behind the wheel, or wanting to eat your cake and have it too.

Doing better than the Eurozone does not necessarily equate to doing well.

This is true, but I don't think it'll be a bad thing in the long-run. In fact, I think it'll be the exact opposite. Much of the Western World is going to face a serious aging problem in the next half-a-century, and not just the West, China &amp; Russia as well *(although Russia looks as if it's taken steps to rectify this problem, and as of now, they seem successful)*.

America's relatively normal growth rate *(which is actually a GOOD growth rate compared to Russia, China &amp; Europe)* will actually lend itself to ensuring the United States has a healthier economy. For example:

Europe, as it is now, has a [ageing population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_Europe) which it desperately needs to correct. It has a decrease in fertility, a decrease in mortality rate, and a higher life expectancy, all of which will only stress and put more burden on many European countries economies *(as well as increase their debt)*.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; So you are saying that the bonds will fix Greece? A banking union is going to fix the productivity in Greece? How, in detail please? The bonds are going to fix the internal devaluation in the south? How, in detail please?

Individual member states can still run into trouble both those troubles won't halt the member states economy as banks are decoupled via banking union from the member state, and having restructuring rules for bonds allows much quicker readjustment measures. Essentially member states still need if necessary to do structural renewal and austerity programs, but they are not in danger to collapse all together.

&gt; I mean, you can not integrate and have a working currency without also having massive transfers. That is Economics 101. There are far to many assymetric shocks, internal devaluation etc. How are you going to deal with that? The Eurzone is not a good currency union.One need financial and political integration. The Finns basically need to start paying off Greece's debt and guarantee Portugal's pensions. Send 30 % of your GDP to Brussel, that is how you are going to make the EZ work.

That is not Econ 101, that is pure stupidity. Look Alabama has enjoyed from fiscal transfer since south lost the war and it still more or less resembles more of an third world state than anything resembling a modern highly developed economy. What the US as an federal entity has given to Alabama is the ability to grow in the protection of the federal government, however Alabama hasn't used that opportunity.

In the Eurozone we should't concentrate on making every single that the same like the rest, but make sure that all Eurozone states have equal opportunities to take advantage of their natural competitive advances and develop in peace under the protection of the union.

&gt; Think about it, when Germany joined, The DDR had far less productivity than the BRD. So, the BRD took over DDR in a way. They paid the debt, they made sure that the stuff like schools, pensions, social systems, health care functioned, and had the banks. They also invested massively to increase the productivity. They still do and transfer more then 100 billion Euros//year to DDR, who is still less productive. Greece/Spain Portugal got nothing of that, despite being far less productive, and yet you expect them to compete having a currency that is essentially adjusted to the needs of the north, mainly Germany. It might work for the Finns, but it doesn't for southern Europe, which has nothing to do with laziness and debt, but with low productivity. So, how are you going to fix that? DDR (former) is still behind despite massive backup for 24 years, and you expect southern Europe just to fix themselves?

The mistake that Germans did was to integrate DDR with rules from Bundes Republic. Eastern Germany would have bounced back much strongly if they would have allowed Eastern Germany to have different labor legislation and market dictated wages. What would have happened would have been the same that happened in all other Eastern states, re-industrialization with western companies moving manufacturing and assembly work there. Yes, East would have suffered but it would have suffered anyway.

Not to mention that low productivity in south has much more to do with how their governments have dictated the society and economy to work. Did you know for example Portugal has had state mandated rent control until last year? The state had dictated rents so low that building owners had no initiative to fix their buildings, not to mention that they couldn't just fire of renters due to strong legislation protecting people who rent. This has caused decay of buildings, has caused ineffective allocation of resources: buildings that should be in other use, or be rented with high rents, were not!

No amount of fiscal transfers will fix productivity issues that stem from the state limiting the functioning of the market. Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece are in trouble because for too long their states have hundred the functioning of the market economy and thus their productivity growth has stagnated while in rest of the Europe and world it has grown.

&gt; And, you also forget, the bonds cements that the Eurozone do not care one bit about treaties and the law. One is not supposed to put in conditions like that, nor take over anyones debt or bail anyone out according to the current treaties. And, the EZ countries are not even attempting to change the law, they just ignore it, like they have thousand times before. I do not understand how one can be a part of, or want to build a currency union without even attempting to respect the law. Why would anyone follow this one, if you haven't followed any other law or treaty?Why don't the Eurozone countries care about that?

It seems that you didn't understand the note about bonds. We are not talking about Eurozone bonds, we are talking about bonds issued by individual member states. They now have clauses that allow easy restructuring of them, thus removing a legal obstacle from member states in trouble to do what is necessary to keep things going on.",0,1388836388,null,0,false,0,ceh2f7t,t3_1ud960,t1_ceh2f7t,t1_ceh26p4,null,1431794365,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

2008 financial crisis was an symmetric shock, it touched all economies from US to China. When we have an asymmetric shock, it touches only some economies while others are left alone. All Eurozone states were shocked in 2008, including Germany. The difference since then has been with rebounding of economies, some economies have had a stronger rebounce like Germany and others like Finland are still in middle of economic and structural renewal. Then there are economies like Spain and Greece were large scale fraud and corruption was found, and in some economies like Portugal the crisis has heightened the crisis they were already in before the 2008 crisis started.

&gt; But these bankruptcies would not be only a function of incompetence and corruption. It would also largely depend on the strength of each economy. You can't have a system that always leads to weak economies going bankrupt every few years. That's insane. This is the equivalent of a rich person saying to the poor ""you don't really need a social safety net, just work harder and be rich like me!"".

Rich countries such as Germany and France can also go bust if they allow fraud and corruption to take too much place, or if their politicians don't take responsibility and live in a lie. For example Greece wouldn't be in a mess that it is now if people a decade ago would have said, you know what...

true,SoulLink,EURO,"Switzerland, Pro-EU","Of course it actually works... most of my peers have made a  apprenticeship and are working. In Switzerland 75% of all people make an apprenticeship after they finish the mandatory 9 years of primary education. (Which excludes high school)

What you dont seem to understand is what an apprenticeship actually is. 

Many companies in Switzerland offer apprenticeships. To do this you need someone with a the proper qualifications (a national certificate, which certifies you the ability to train an apprentice in your job). After that students send in applications for these jobs (depending on the job an company the number of applicants can range from 0 to several hundred) and they then take the one (or several in big companies like UBS/Post/ABB etc.) they like the most and hire you as an apprentice. This means you will get paid, but less than a skilled worker. The apprenticeship takes 2 to 4 years and can be supplemented by going to school for a day or two in order to get a graduation which is similar to a high school graduation. You will get paid every year more until you are finished. Then if you are lucky and worked hard they will hire you for real. If not you will have to look for a job at an other company. Which is usually not too hard. 

You can make an apprenticeship in pretty much every job there is. A friend of mine makes an apprenticeship in webdesign for example. At the end he will be proficient in the basics of CS, will have learned relevant programming languages (PHP, JavaScript, CSS, HTML etc.), will be able to work with the available tools and most importantly will know how the company which trains him works and will be able to give usefull imput as he will have the skills which said company needs.

Another guy has the last blacksmith specializing in horseshoe apprenticeship in the canton bern. It is still a usefull job. One however does not need that many skilled blacksmiths anymore as the market is very small and extremly specialized.

I hope you can see that this is an extremly usefull system and I believe one of the main reasons why Switzerland has such a strong economy.

This is the strawman argument that I have to reply to every day. The answer is no, obviously not. The only claim I'm making is that you've provided no evidence to show that this (very real and very existing) corruption was a necessary and sufficient condition for the crisis. In addition, you have provided no evidence to show that adoption of the euro is an independent variable as far as the crisis is concerned.

Members of the Eurozone do not meet most of these criteria.

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; Basically all school boards in the overwhelming majority of European countries prescribe that British English and not American English be taught.

The gist of it is that people who learn English primarily in school are also generally the *least* proficient, and most speakers will be far below the level where the ""target accent"" is clearly discernible.

People learn language through media exposure and interaction, and on that account American clearly dominates. The result is that the English used as a lingua franca among non-native speakers has more resemblance with American than British, particularly in vocabulary — let's face it, pronunciation is most often drowned out by native accent, except in very advanced speakers. I don't have statistics for school boards across Europe, but as far as I've heard most schools in Scandinavia let their pupils (or students, as it were :-P) choose either dialect, as long as they stick with it and know the distinction. I remember high school English class, which bizarrely featured a British-speaking teacher teaching a class of students all speaking clear American, rhotic retroflective R and everything.

The problem with your argument is that it actually makes English *less* useful for Europeans to insist on British English. BE is understood as a regional dialect of English, and not ""neutral grounds"". That is to say, a statement uttered in distinctly British English will be understood in a context of British culture — especially since many of the distinguishing artefacts of BE are very particular and foreign to Europeans, who are more used to saying ""trash"" rather than ""rubbish"", ""bus"" rather than ""coach"", ""cookie"" rather than ""biscuit"", ""dessert"" rather than ""pudding"", ""drug store"" rather than ""chemist"", and the list goes on.

Bear in mind that not only are we much more exposed to American influences, but American English is the result of British English exposed to *our* languages in the big American melting pot. If anything, it is the *less* foreign version of English to many Europeans. :-)

Requiring people to not only speak a foreign language but also arbitrarily accommodate a minority of English-speakers in Europe — that is, native speakers — to the detriment of everyone else's understanding, just isn't feasible, for both practical and political reasons. Speaking one's own native language means having the upper hand, so speaking ""neutral English"" is absolutely necessary.

Personally I'd be against it because I feel as though it would ruin pretty much all of our coastal cities. I mean, the capitals of the UK's four constituent countries (London, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast) are all originally port cities. Just about the only major cities I can think of that would go unskaved are Glasgow, Leeds, Birmingham and Sheffield (We're important, Ok?!).

I'm not gonna go down the ""it'll damage our economy""- route because, whilst a significant shipping and maritime industry does remain, the trend is towards such industries playing an even more marginal roll *and* those industries are already very far from the cities they initially started in. Canary Wharf used to be the main port of London, but now all the shipping traffic hardly even goes up the Thames River at all. Same story for Liverpool.

But here's the real clincher for me. What's the benefit of it all? What do we really *get* from having extra land, as UK citizens. More land. To do what? Grow food? We don't have an issue with food. Sure the UK isn't self sufficient, and why should it be? There's plenty of other places in Europe and Africa for us to get food from. Housing prices are getting quite high, yes, but *draining the North Sea* to alleviate housing prices seems like overkill to me.

Firstly, it isn't completely clear that Catalans represent a ""people"" under international law as this concept is also uncertain. Secondly, Catalans already do have some self-governance and some autonomy. Thirdly,  the right to self-determination under international law grew up in relation to colonialism and occupation by foreign powers, and it is hard to argue that this applies in the case of Spain and Catalunia. Fourthly, the principle of sovereignty and non-interference under international law is very strong (and in my opinion this is why the EU should not get involved).

I therefore think the legal argument is not the best one for Catalunia at the moment. If they want independence, they should vote for parties in favour of intependence in elections and then try and negotiate a political agreement with Spain once they have a majority.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"&gt; The problem with your argument is that it actually makes English less useful for Europeans to insist on British English. BE is understood as a regional dialect of English, and not ""neutral grounds""

I'm not sure what you mean exactly by ""neutral grounds"". No accent is truly neutral. When I hear Europeans with distinctly American accents it puts it on a background of American culture *just as much* as a European or indeed myself speaking with a British accent places what's being said on a background of British culture. 

Furthermore BE's words sound foreign to you and perhaps your peers because you're not used to them. I'm not going to argue that you should ""relearn"" English or something. You've learnt it now and that's fine. However to claim that British English words sounds strange to Europeans because they sound weird to you is very circular logic. 

I can see what your saying about American English being partly the product of European simplification which makes it easier for Europeans to learn, but I really don't buy into it. They're both equally difficult. There's a few loan words from European languages like ""cookie"" which comes from Dutch but there's also different loan words that BE speakers use that Americans don't. For instance the ""coffee is not foreseen"" phrase is becoming more and more popular, which was brought into BE through native French and Dutch speakers (the phrase is common to both languages). So for me that argument just doesn't hold water.  

&gt; Requiring people to not only speak a foreign language but also arbitrarily accommodate a minority of English-speakers in Europe

BE are not necessarily a minority. Most of the natively English world uses something which either is or very closely approximates one of two dialects. There's the British dialect, those which are very close to it, and the American dialect. The British dialect is spoken in the UK (obviously). The American dialect (or dialects) is spoken in the USA (obviously). Those which approximate the British dialect include all members of the [Commonwealth of Nations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations) which has an over 2 billion people in population. Not all of those countries are majority English speaking and not all of approximate BE exactly, but they all speak English much more like the British than they do the Americans. For instance whilst Canada is geographically very close to the USA it uses the BE spellings (centre, aluminium, labour, polarisation). Furthermore, whilst I am counting several dialects here, there is strong evidence that the US doesn't have one singular American dialect. I'm not just talking about New England vs California accents, but also Cajun and Hispanic dialects. So there's a strong case for British English actually being the majority dialect of English.

Furthermore, even if the American dialect is the majority one, you still live much closer to the UK and Ireland and Malta than you do to the USA. Even if you find yourself in China, you're much closer geographically to natively English speaking country which approximates BE than AE, this is without mentioning that only until recently (C.2010?) China itself learned BE. Additionally you're much more likely to come across BE speakers in the real world because of the Common Market and the EU's freedom of movement. It's easier for you to go to Britain than America. It's easier for a Briton to go to you than to the US and it's more likely that you both will because of the economic incentives to do so (freedom of employment in other EU countries).

So is British English really *less* useful to you than American English? ",0,1388842360,null,0,false,0,ceh3dcj,t3_1tlj8x,t1_ceh3dcj,t1_ceh2x05,null,1431794811,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

It depends obviously on the job you are learning, but as a rule of thumps the more hight skill the job is the lower your salary will start at, but the steeper it will climb. 

I dont have exact numbers but pays ranges start from 300 to 2000 CHF and end in your last year between 2500 to 6000 CHF. So if you start at 2000 you will probably end with around 3000 CHF. After your aprrenticeship you will get the common starting salary. 

&gt;what's the situation with housing costs during that period?

Housing costs are extremly high in Switzerland, however as Switzerland is extremly small and densly populated with one of the if not the best public transportation network in the world, most young people live at home at the beginning.

Morally speaking, I don't think the Catalans require the agreement of the rest of Spain to form their own nation. In practical terms though, national governments usually aren't set up with the possibility of secession in mind, and regional legislatures usually aren't invested with the authority to unilaterally withdraw from a country on behalf of their people (though maybe it would be better if they were). So in the legal sense, Catalonia voting for independence has roughly the same force as Catalonia voting the moon is made of cheese, although in the moral sense (and, I suspect, one reason why the Spanish government is working so hard to prevent an independence vote), it would provide a powerful stimulus to begin discussing what Catalonian independence would look like, and how it could be accomplished (as rightly it should).",0,1388842402,null,0,false,0,ceh3dnl,t3_1udq4q,t1_ceh3dnl,t1_ceh39hg,null,1431794815,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Each Constituency elections goes like so:

* Everyone Gets one vote.
* You use that vote to vote for a candidate.
* Everyone's votes are counted up. The Candidate with the most votes gets the constituency.

Notes, The Most Votes. Not 50% or more. the Most votes. This produces a bias towards united 'wing parties' rather than smaller, more representative parties.

*Eg:*

In the Small (made up) Scottish Consistency of the Falkyrie Isles, There are 100 voters.

Sixty of them are left-wingers of some description, with an inbred hatred of Thatcher for closing their beloved pit.

Forty of them are right-wingers, normally retired pensioners who moved here to get 'some peace and quiet.'

Due to a falling out among party Leadership, There are now two left wing parties, the Labour Party and the recent off-shoot Social Democratic Party. There is one right wing party, the Conservatives.

Election Day!

* Conservatives: 40
* Labour: 30
* Social Democratic Party: 30

Conservatives Win, even though the 30 SDP voters would much rather Labour win and vice versa.

That' one way.


Here is another:

Let's say there are three political parties nationwide, Left, Right and Center. As a percent of the popular vote (which is irrelevant under FPTP, see above) Left/Right poll 40% each, and Center 20%.

true,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; When I hear Europeans with distinctly American accents it puts it on a background of American culture just as much as a European or indeed myself speaking with a British accent places what's being said on a background of British culture.

For you. :-) Europeans don't necessarily make that connection, but more importantly: Americans aren't a part of the conversation, so nobody is gaining home-field advantage. That's what I mean by ""neutral grounds"".

&gt; Furthermore BE's words sound foreign to you and perhaps your peers because you're not used to them.

Certainly. Personally, I've become used to them only after actually living in England.

&gt; American English being partly the product of European simplification

""Simplification""? That's a rather condescending way to put it.

It's not that American English is inherently easier to learn, it's just that it's that much more prevalent and available. Even then, American English may be easier to comprehend for some foreign speakers, on account of being rhotic (Are they saying ""father"" or ""farther""? When comprehension is shaky and the context is blurry, these distinctions can become important).

&gt; However to claim that British English words sounds strange to Europeans because they sound weird to you is very circular logic.

Let's be clear, I'm only recounting personal experience here, having interacted with people from most European countries in English. No scientific data here.

&gt; For instance the ""coffee is not foreseen"" phrase is becoming more and more popular, which was brought into BE through native French and Dutch speakers (the phrase is common to both languages). So for me that argument just doesn't hold water.

That phrase is specific to the European Parliament, though — a non-Dutch or non-French English speaker would probably not use that phrase unless having spent time inside the European bureaucracy. :-)

&gt; Most of the natively English world uses something which either is or very closely approximates one of two dialects.

Yes, but most of the anglophone world lies outside of Europe. :-)

&gt; Furthermore, whilst I am counting several dialects here, there is strong evidence that the US doesn't have one singular American dialect.

Obviously, though I don't see what the relevance is here. Britain has a plethora of dialects as well, but we're talking about the ""standardised Englishes"" as the most prominently endorsed variants. Received Pronunciation is spoken by a tiny minority in Britain. I think you're misrepresenting the argument here by pointing to the plurality of American dialects while presuming that British English is just one thing, which clearly it is not.

&gt; Furthermore, even if the American dialect is the majority one, you still live much closer to the UK and Ireland and Malta than you do to the USA.

Fairly irrelevant. Cultural influence does not rely on geographical proximity. For the purpose of communication and trade, British English and American English are completely interchangeable.

&gt; So is British English really less useful to you than American English?

Yes.

So the huge thing you're missing in your argument is that the vast majority of European English-speakers do *not* use English to communicate with native English speakers. They use it to communicate with *other non-native speakers*. If I meet a German my own age, chances are their English is vastly better than my German, so we speak English. Both of us are more familiar with American vernacular and idioms than British ones.

true,xdey,POLA,Polska,"&gt;What are you talking about- tied to gold?

[Gold standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard#Gold_exchange_standard)

It was akin to Bretton Woods though tied to gold and not to the USD and with a much harder peg (with Bretton Woods countries could just set a different parity to the USD and devalue their currency whereas with gold there were more restrictions as the currency in circulation had to be backed by the gold reserves in the central bank).

&gt;And you are on purpose ignoring the enormous internal devaluation and the enormous unemployment in the south. 

Which is not caused by a monetary phenomenon?

Estonia and now Latvia are in the Eurozone and they're both weaker economies than say Spain or Greece and yet even with the euro their unemployment is about average the EU and decreasing and they're the countries growing the most.

So if you say ""the poorer Southern European countries are worse off because of the Euro being a strong currency"" and ignore all evidence of monetary systems which have worked and work without any issue despite several different countries taking part in it and even other European countries who are even worse than the Southern European ones and also have the Euro, then that's ignoring hard evidence that your hypothesis is factually wrong.

&gt;what does that have to do with the free floating SEK and the free pound and USD. And you said yourself that our currencies work. 

The SEK works for Sweden just as the USD works for the USA and the EUR works for the EU, that's my point. The arguments which make you say the Euro doesn't work can also be used to say that the SEK or the USD doesn't work, and that would be ludicrous.

&gt;And you are on purpose ignoring the enormous internal devaluation and the enormous unemployment in the south. 

That's how economies readjust, to say that losing purchasing power to inflation is somehow better than losing purchasing power to unemployment is silly, one or the other is going to happen whenever governments overspend and then can't finance themselves properly.

&gt;doing as you and claiming the Euro is good while ignoring that it is a badly constructed currency

The Euro is just as a good/bad constructed currency as any other (like the SEK or the USD, for example). Money is neutral and if monetary policy isn't going crazy (say massively deflating or inflating the money supply) then problems in the economy have real causes and not monetary ones.

Portugal once shared a currency with the UK through the gold standard, and Portugal was poorer than the UK not because of it but because back then we had higher tariffs, more interventionism and higher mismanagement of public funds.

&gt;the EZ is to diverse to have the same currency without massive transfers and that one need political and financial integration too, that is wrong.

The Turks and Moroccans were recruited in their home countries as temporary workers in the 60s, they came from often rural area's and were especially picked for a low education so that they wouldn't make trouble. They didn't made trouble indeed, and they decided to stay as well. But their children finding themselves in a new progressive western country that distrusted them a bit, being raised with more conservative and a lot less education pressure from their peers created a bit more trouble and thus have as a group  higher crime rates, lower educaton (with poor skill in dutch and tent to keep to themselves (discrimination is also a cause of this) resulting in self segregation. There is also some other cultural habits that don't fit well, such as the high honor, making it difficult to accept failure and they are seen as a bit aggresive (a big news item lately was the death of a socces referee kicked to death by morrocan and turkish soccer players, when they didn't agree with him, from what I have heard though is that this kind of violence was also very common with dutch people some decennia's ago)

For a company hiring a person which is more likely to commit crimes and have worse work ethic (nordic work ethic). There is also a lot of prejudice, the annoying thing is way to often is confirmed because the groups do tent to do more crimes and are more easily distinguesed due to their appearance, for most people any more brown pigmented person are seen as a turk or a morrocan which can include other groups like roma. Then there is also a tendensy i have noticed where criminal acts of morrocan and turkish youth is passed off by their elders as just being kids causing a teedlybit light hearted trouble. 

You will see the hatred a lot less in other immigrant groups, I guess the turks and morrocans are seen as betrayers of our tolerance, the feeling is they are not integrated (which I believe people want too far, dutch culture by no means is perfect and has it's flaws, the same counts for morrocan and turkish culture). The hatred offcourse doesn't help and only results to more self-segregations of these groups. The high crime rate and self-segregation in turn also doesn't help and will also only result in more bad feelings towards these groups. It's a circle of hate and both groups have to change for it to become better.

**[European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey](http://fra.europa.eu/en/survey/2012/eu-midis-european-union-minorities-and-discrimination-survey)**

&gt;In response to a widespread lack of data on the experiences of immigrants and ethnic minorities in the European Union, in 2008 the FRA carried out its first large-scale survey covering all the 27 EU Member States.
&gt;
&gt;EU-MIDIS interviewed a random sample of 23,500 immigrants and ethnic minorities from selected groups in each country, using a standardised questionnaire so that the results can be compared across groups and countries. In ten Member States the survey interviewed a randomly selected sample of majority population respondents living in or around the same areas as the minority respondents. The interviews with majority respondents, 500 per country, used a shorter questionnaire aimed at allowing a comparison between the experiences of the two respondent groups for key survey items.
&gt;
&gt;The extensive face-to-face interviews covered a number of topics, most importantly respondents’ experiences of discrimination, victimisation and police stops. In addition to the main topics, the survey also collected a wide range of socio-demographic information on the respondents, allowing for a detailed analysis of the results.

They are generally well acepted, with differences here and there (some countries accept better than others, some countries need foreign workers more than others, some countries are more hospitable than others, etc...). But there are always preconceptions and different reactions depending on the country of origin, though.

As far as immigrants are concerned (from outside-EU), it's really hard to address from a global European perspective, since it really varies between countries and political/economical cycles.

No decent folk take it seriously. 

It's interesting to see how the portrayal of ""Osties"" has about-faced, it wasn't too long ago the Eastern Bloc were repressed folk suffering under the yolk of communism, denied their freedoms, etc. Little more than twenty years after gaining their freedoms they're now all daring to exercise them in travelling around.

true,Prestian,BELG,"Flanders, Belgium","I'm just going to copy my comment from a thread a few weeks ago. I'm still facing the same doubts, though I'm shifting towards the Greens.

&gt;I'm really doubting in this election who to vote for.

&gt;I've always voted for the greens so far and I still really believe that climate change and energy independence is the most important political issue. Especially on the European level, where green policy can have a much bigger and effective impact.

&gt;But on the other hand I have a lot of sympathy for the socialdemocrats. I'd like to see the European Union take a turn to the left in their economic policy and I do think that this election could change that. If the socialdemocrats win these elections and become the biggest fraction again, it's probable that the EU will rethink some policies. Especially now that the fractions each will propose their own President of the European Commission. If the socialdemocrats decisively win these election, it's highly probable the European Council win install the socialdemocrat candidate (Martin Shultz) as the new president of the commission. I know that Barosso ~~also comes from the left side of the political spectrum~~, but he was never chosen by the masses. Martin Shultz would have a mandate and a role as representative of his voters.

&gt;So I'm a doubting. On the one hand a more leftist approach is something I think will only happen with the socialdemocrats, because they'll be big enough to change the course. On the other hand in some way this whole economic side of the story doesn't matter anyway with the threath of climate change hanging above our heads. I'd like it that green policy would become the norm for the other traditional parties, but so long it isn't that way, I'd still need to vote for the greens until that happens.

I'll try to put some facts before my opinion.

In 2006 Catalonia held a referendum for a new statute of autonomy. The turnout was of 48% of the voting population, and was approved by a 78% margin. 

The ruling party in the Catalan parliament then was  PSC/PSOE and the president Pascual Maragall, historical PSOE leader and Barcelona Mayor for 15 years. The statute was put to vote after being passed in the Catalan parliament by a huge majority with a single question in both official languages ""Do you approve the project of the new statute of autonomy?"".

The new statue was presented to vote in the Spanish General Courts (Spanish Parliament), by representatives of the ruling party PSC/PSOE, and the main opposition party CiU, as well as ERC. 
The President of the Spanish Government also from PSOE, Jose Luis R Zapatero,  also intervened to ask for a favorable vote in 
the parliament. 

The parliament approved the consideration with the votes of all political parties except the Popular Party (Current ruling party in Spain). Then it went to the Senate, where it also passed with only the negative votes, again, of the Popular Party, and the abstention of ERC. The abstention of ERC provoked a major shake in the Catalan government, where they were ruling with PSC/PSOE's and ICV, the green party. 
Maragall, the Catalan President, dissolved the tripartite government and called for early elections, where again, PSC/PSOE was able to form a majority with ERC and ICV, a new tripartite with exactly the same parties, the new President also from PSOE Mr. Montilla.

After being passed in the Spanish Parliament with an overwhelming majority, the popular party presented a recourse at the  Constitutional Tribunal, the highest court. It's fair to mention, the Popular Party also presented recourses at the same court for the Same Sex Marriage Bill, the new Education Law, the new Abortion Law, and quite a few others.

At this point is fair to say, that the new statue of autonomy  approved by referendum with less than half of eligible population in Catalonia, was approved by the Spanish Parliament, thus the Spanish people,  by a great margin.

Once the recourse was accepted by the Constitutional Tribunal, other institutions joined in the recourse, mostly other autonomies against certain points which varied from the control of the Archive of the Crown of Aragon, to the terminology of Nation included in the statute.

I hope this timeline helps to prove my point, that the Spanish people, which is people from at least 5 different nationalities, with 4 different languages, and dozens of different cultures do not have anything against Catalonia and its peculiarities, they are not seen as different from other nationalities (this is what pisses off nationalists), and their language and customs are respected and protected, not only by law, but also by common sense.

The Constitutional Tribunal, which in my opinion, and most Spanish people, is outdated, nonfunctional, slow, and highly politicized, took four years to come with a decision. The ruling was to declare some points of the statute unconstitutional, but mostly constitutional, with a ruling of 6 to 4, the term Nation was approved, but other points where declared unconstitutional those who affected main constitutional articles, as the ""indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation"", but mostly those referring to the transfer of VAT and income taxes.

This was perceived in the Catalan political scene as an aggression to Catalonia, with huge popular demonstrations with all political forces except the Popular Party and the newly created Ciutatans Party.

At this point everything was business as usual, political confrontations, the neverending interpretation of the Spanish Constitution, and the failure of all involved to reach political agreements. It's fair to say that the Popluar Party, a conservative, right wing party (though they insist they are center-right),  represents a huge percentage of Spanish voters, but that does not mean there are very different opinions in their ranges on many different issues, they have managed to incorporate all the right wing trends, and this is the reason there is not any extreme-right party in Spanish politics.

All that happened while in Catalonia the nationalists were not ruling the government for the first time since the democracy, it's important to mention that CiU, a Catalan nationalist party, held the Catalan Government for 23 years. During which, in the Spanish Parliament, helped two out of three Spanish governments, in what they called ""better governance of Spain"". They had been a huge strong political force in Spain since the arrival of democracy, and were indispensable part of the different Spanish governments for more than 30 years. Making pacts with left and right governments, which was always seen in Catalonia as a strong arm of Catalan influence in the state.

This is getting ridiculously long, and probably getting to imprecise also, so for now, I want to say that, Catalan people vote, they vote in referendums, they vote in Autonomy Elections, they vote in General Elections, they vote in European Elections. The Catalan people are diverse and they elect different governments in different times. The Catalan Nation as a term was approved by the Constitutional Tribunal and the Catalan Nationality as well as the Basque Nationality, Galician Nationality are recognized in the Spanish Constitution since it was put to vote in the 70's and voted with an overwhelming majority of the Catalan population.",0,1388849629,null,0,false,0,ceh50zt,t3_1udq4q,t1_ceh50zt,t3_1udq4q,null,1431795654,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Sensationalism is infectious and addictive, and on minor(from the point of view of a British reader) topics , they tend to be viewed subjectively from the filter of local politics.

Self-determination is a very set principle of international law and it's a jus cogens norm, very much like torture,genocide,etc. It's mandatory to respect. 

ICJ self-determination cases : 

http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=3&amp;case=84&amp;code=pa&amp;p3=4

http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=4&amp;k=21&amp;case=141&amp;code=kos&amp;p3=4

I'm sure that I'm forgetting a few of them,but those are the two first that come to mind. It's essentially the principle on which many states in history have become countries. Former Yugoslav Republics come to mind,former colonial countries, USA as well. It's very much defined and important.It has existed since for ever.

Self-determination is essentially divided between internal self-determination and external self-determination.Internally essentially implies representation of the certain group within the national constitutional legal framework,through whatever means the state in question decides to do so.External self-determination is seen as independence recognition, and only as a last resort alternative if internal self-determination cannot be respected.

Self-determination is very much defined within international law, and creates obligations on states to respect them,without derogation. 

For example,Kosovo can claim independence based on the external element of this,whilst Catalonia most probably does not fulfill that requirement and may have to solve this internally.

Autonomy does very much fulfill the criteria for internal self-determination,and if I'm not mistaken,Catalonia is an autonomous province of Spain. It's very hard to argue that they don't fulfill criteria for internal self-determination already,thus, independence claims based on external self-determination are even more unlikely to succeed.

That, and some strong cultural differences that sets Swiss apart from Germans, especially from Bavarians (speech and social manners -wise).

I can vote for Fine Gael, a right-wing conservative Catholic party.

Or Fianna Fáil, also a right-wing conservative Catholic party, but with the added bonus of being treasonously responsible for Ireland's banking crisis and corrupt to the core.

I could go with Labour, in theory a centre-left party but in practice a left-of-centre conservative Catholic party who have gone back on virtually every promise and every stance they had taken and they are now indistinguishable from Fine Gael, their coalition partner. They have practically no credibility, and they need to be wiped out and replaced with a proper social democratic party.

There's always Sinn Fein, a party led by a former terrorist, formerly supportive of and indeed actively involved in terrorism, and unrepentant about it. They're social democratic and support secularism though, which is nice. They're also not sell outs...although I'm not into their nationalism and a lot of their leadership should probably be in gaol for their role in The Troubles. 

There's the Green Party, which was wiped out at virtually all levels of government last election for being in bed with Fianna Fáil. A vote for them is almost as unconscionable as one for their former masters. Why this party still exists is beyond me; the Progressive Democracts, Ireland's Dick Cheney to Fianna Fail's George Bush, had the good sense to wind up when they were wiped out two elections ago.

Lastly there is the United Left Alliance, which, drawing inspiration from around the world, isn't actually united; they aren't even a party, just a consortium of democratic socialist independents and minor DS parties. The credentials of the members vary wildly, and although I support many aspects of their social agenda I am not a socialist. That said, I wonder if maybe in the current climate I should vote further left than I really am instead of further right.

According to this page: http://www.wohnungsboerse.net/mietspiegel-Berlin/2825 300€ is slightly under average for a 30m² ""studio"", but it depends on the district.
There are flats with a kitchenette, flats with a seperated kitchen (size between 4 and 10 m²).

&gt;Is it furnished?

Most flats in Germany are empty (except the bathroom and the heating system), some have a kitchen unit (""mit EK"").

&gt;What about utilities, are they included in the rent?

Probably not. But there are definitely flats for 300€ including all utilities in the less demanded areas. If your looking for flats, there are ""kaltmiete"" (without utilities) and ""warmmiete"" (with utilities), but in general even warmmiete doesn't include power (about 30€/month) and gas (20€/month) supply.

Some information appears outdated/inaccurate:

- Room in a student hall of residence: € 200 : If you want your own bathroom it's about 300€.

- 1 cinema ticket (concessions price) € 4 to € 8 :
more like 8-12 € in the big ones.

- clothes : The minimum prices are about 30% to high. And then there is Primark - trousers about 10€, shoes 3€, t-shirts and underwear even cheaper.

You cant' say your (Some of you) claims were being ignored, when the 2006 statue was approved by the Spanish parliament and the Spanish senate, that's the Spanish people.

As timelines go, Mr Mas, frustrated by loosing two times the government, felt he had no time to build a complex negotiation that in Spain, the reality is must include PP, sadly changed his opinion, in the weakest moment of Spain, believing he could blackmail all Spain.

What nationalists don't seem to recognize is the energy of the Spanish people, many believe that they can bring Spain to its knees, and that is not true.

Catalonia, that was the lighthouse of Spain while I was growing up, has become a sort of last century society, that still speaks of the ""media of Madrid"" in the information age, that distorts the reality of the complex Spanish society, reducing it to simpleton assessments, that speaks of Catalans vs Spanish, which is not only a semantic inaccuracy, but a historical absurdity.

Here we can see that the U.S government accepted in 2012 11,978.
Since that's for the whole year we'll divide it by 4.
So let's go say they accepted 4k a quarter . We still haven't accounted for the population and wealth differences of both these nations. American being bigger in almost every aspect GPD/Per capita ect.

First, you need to 'translate' your site into English (not American) and remember that many British people are intolerant of spelling and grammatical errors! (Eg : ""we are in talk of opening....."" Is wrong!)

Secondly, your website colours and design are dull, dull, dull! Find a decent web designer!

Next, while your idea doesn't fire me up, I can see its potential, particularly for 'stag weekends' or family reunions. You might need to invest in some proper market research!

Travel in Europe is not just about aeroplanes and hire cars - if you can tap into the increasingly popular long- distance / high-speed rail travel network and the very economical, and improving long distance coach travel markets, then you might be able to carve a niche in a very crowded market. (Don't forget ferries either!)

Again, air travel in Europe is largely sewn up by the multitude of low cost airlines, I struggle to believe that you can undercut or discount them - so I need a reason to book through your site - what's my incentive? Make it clear!

It can be 'less than easy' to find budget hotels in countries other than your own - another market opportunity?

If I'm using your site to book as a group, I might want to hire a minibus at my journey's end - help me by pointing me to specialist hire companies, not just the 'usual suspects'. Organise me!

I hope you don't consider this all negative - but you are attempting to enter a very crowded market, at a very difficult time. You need realism, luck and a good tail wind!",0,1388856634,null,0,false,0,ceh7e3y,t3_1uc4rg,t1_ceh7e3y,t3_1uc4rg,null,1431796785,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

And then ultimately rejected, so what happened earlier means close to nothing.

""As timelines go, Mr Mas, frustrated by loosing two times the government, felt he had no time to build a complex negotiation that in Spain, the reality is must include PP, sadly changed his opinion, in the weakest moment of Spain, believing he could blackmail all Spain.""

I somewhat agree with this. However, I think there is more to it than that. For example, a moment ofweakness for Spain, means a moment for Catalonia to be able to excercise our rights. There is no blackmail, that would mean the point of threatening independence would only be to get more competencies, but we know it's not. I won't further expand on this as I think it's quite obvious.

""What nationalists don't seem to recognize is the energy of the Spanish people, many believe that they can bring Spain to its knees, and that is not true.""

Now you are just antagonizing use. I don't give no shits about Spain. I want to be an independent country, using the right to self-determination. That's hardly trying to humilliate Spain or its citizens (both of which I love, don't get me wrong).

""Now I find myself witnessing the ridicule of the Catalan society, building castles in the air, aiming for a sort of independent state that would seek an all in alliance with what's left of the Spanish state on day one, that's lecturing European governments about how the EU must behave for them, that's writing letters to Spanish allies asking for help in destroying the Spanish state, and rising the menace of how Europe will suffer if they don't side with that ideas.""

Now this I agree completely. As we would say in catalan,  the movement is full of ""somiatruites"", which means there is a lot of idealism and people isn't realistic at all.

""Catalonia, that was the lighthouse of Spain while I was growing up, has become a sort of last century society, that still speaks of the ""media of Madrid"" in the information age, that distorts the reality of the complex Spanish society, reducing it to simpleton assessments, that speaks of Catalans vs Spanish, which is not only a semantic inaccuracy, but a historical absurdity. It's sad to see Barcelona, a great universal city, kidnapped by the red-neck ""palleses"".""

This is borderline racist and very much a matter of opinion. I want to add that many catalans would find this very offensive.

Lisbon is the most multicultural place, with some African ghettos. Brazilians make the majority of immigrants and usually integrate very well. In fact, I think we could use more of them and their optimism.

I think there's something about becoming Portuguese that tones down feelings of racism or ethnocentricities. We are very depressed and apathetical towards everything, racism included! So, why bother, right? Let's drink and weep for past losses, individual and collective. As if suffering was a unifying force and we were watching things unfold from far away.

As a German living in the UK it makes me sick to see the same bullshit talking points (that look like straight out of the Daily Mail) in Germany.

That's a lie, because the first paragraph of the Wikipedia article says, and I quote:

&gt;Socialism is an economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy.[1] ""Social ownership"" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these.[2] There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them.[3] They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the degree to which they rely on markets or planning, how management is to be organised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in constructing socialism.[4]

So, in the definition of socialism I was referring to Europe is fully socialist because all major parties promote heavy market regulation (controlled markets), state ownership of key industries, welfare state, etc.

**Mrs** or **Mrs.** (Standard English pronunciation /ˈmɪsɨz/) is a honorific used for women, usually for those who are married and who do not instead use another title, such as Dr, Lady, or Dame. In most Commonwealth countries, a full stop (period) is not used with the title. In the United States and Canada a period is used (see Abbreviation).

true,_delirium,DENK,Denmark,"Although it's not *nearly* as big a debate, there's a little debate starting in Denmark over European immigrants too. Mostly because the increasing number has led to awkward questions over the role of English in Danish society. Danes nearly all speak English, therefore it's often practical to use English in mixed audiences. And because there are many foreign students and workers, especially in Copenhagen, many audiences are mixed audiences. Examples: the official corporate language of Maersk is English, many masters degree programs use English as the language of instruction, almost any technology company uses English as the workplace language, many public lectures in Copenhagen (especially scientific ones) are given in English, etc.

This has caused some people to be worried about the future role of Danish, and led to a mild backlash against European immigrants from the populist right, even ""near"" immigrants from Northern Europe. [Here's a link to one minor kerfluffle](http://cphpost.dk/news/student-to-buck-500-years-of-history-by-delivering-speech-in-english.7762.html) on that subject.

In tempi recenti i neuroscienziati hanno mostrato molto interesse per l'argomento e così si è scoperto, tramite fRMI, che la meditazione altera fisicamente il cervello; questo spiega i benefici che chi pratica sostiene di avere ottenuto, tra cui spiccano: riduzione dell'ansia, maggiore autocontrollo, maggiore empatia, maggiore capacità di concentrarsi, sensazione di benessere durante e immediatamente dopo la seduta.

In genere si medita stando seduti, anche su una semplice sedia, e rimanendo nella stessa posizione per tutta la durata dell'esercizio. Le tecniche di *Mindfulness* solitamente riguardano la concentrazione sul respiro (il quale non va controllato, ma semplicemente osservato), ogni volta che la mente si distrae — e lo farà spesso — l'attenzione va riportata al processo respiratorio.

Le tecniche di *Vipassana* si concentrano meno su un singolo oggetto, in quanto mirano ad essere consapevoli di qualsiasi cosa emerga nel proprio corpo. Si osserva sempre il respiro, ma si studiano anche pruriti, dolori ed emozioni, si impara a non giudicarli e a lasciarli andare così come sono arrivati.

Devo precisare che ho scoperto la nomenclatura delle varie discipline solo diversi mesi dopo che ho iniziato a praticare, quindi potrei avere detto qualche inesattezza. Dal canto mio, credo di praticare un misto delle due tecniche summenzionate.

Je copie-colle ici ce qui, selon moi, a aggravé le phénomène :

1. La politique d'Israël. Dès que tu la critiques, tu es antisémite. Le [sketch de Bedos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbo3_lYFM2c) à ce sujet est éloquent.
2. Quand on veut disqualifier quelqu'un, on le traite d'antisémite. L'exemple des [accusations sur Mélenchon](http://blogs.mediapart.fr/blog/stephane-allies/240313/melenchon-antisemite-ou-la-fabrique-dun-buzz-factice) parle de lui-même.
3. Les accusations d'antisémitisme profitent in fine à Israël et aux associations comme le CRIF. On  pourrait même parler de propagande tant elles sont relayées sans vérification par les médias. Je reprends ici les thèses de [Attali](http://www.courrierinternational.com/article/2009/10/26/jacques-attali-l-antisemitisme-et-la-propagande-israelienne) et ce [documentaire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2t4y7PErNk) de Yoav Shamir.
4. L'idéologie de la repentance et de la culpabilité de la France actuelle, comme on peut le voir [ici](http://www.tribunejuive.info/politique/la-france-nation-criminelle), qui sont tout simplement inacceptables et historiquement fausses.

Tout a commencé avec un sketch sur un **colon israélien**. Et quand je dis colon, je parle du truc plein de merde au-dessus du rectum qui s'installe sur une terre qui n'est pas à lui.

Et ne pas oublier que l'antisémite, selon la [B'nai B'rith](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%27nai_B%27rith), c'est [quelqu'un qui a  répondu oui à 3 des quatre questions suivantes](http://archive.adl.org/anti_semitism/adl_anti-semitism_presentation_february_2012.pdf) :

Yup, you're right.

I still disagree with him when he (or the bible) says things like ""greed is bad"" when I've came to the conclusion that everybody is self-interested and will always act in their own behalf and the behalf of their children first and only later on the behalf of others and so IMO anyone trying to fight against greed or self-interest is fighting an unwinnable battle.

Though, on the other hand, I do was raised as a Christian and one thing that I still try to follow is the golden rule and not do to others what I wouldn't want others to do to me.

&gt;But I was replying to the someone claiming that there is something 'interesting' in not being 'catholic' and 'socialist' at the same time (well, for me this way of thinking is interesting, as from what I observed in my life I find correlation between being socialist and being catholic rather low), so I thought that Pius' quote was extremly relevant there.

I think that Pius said that because of Marx's claim that religion is the opium of the masses and the anti-religion stance many socialist states have taken.

* 77% wants to have limits on foreignes to stay in the country, 11% doesn't want immigrants at all, 9% would like no limits,
* 62% thinks they should behave completely like the the locals, 32% at least partially, 5% thinks they should behave as they are used in countries of their origin,
* 93% thinks it is necessary for immigrants to know the Czech language,
* 81% thinks foreigners are danger to employment of locals, 79% is for setting limits in areas with high unemplyment,
* 58% thinks that recent immigrants are problem, 33% does not,
* 67% thinks they increase criminality


However, Czechs make a distinction between different nationalities. Slovaks are not perceived as foreigners at all, other Slavic people are felt as quite close and able to assimilate, educated whites from the West are generally not viewed as a threat. This research got the most pessimistic answers because of lumping all the immigrants into one group.

true,xdey,POLA,Polska,"&gt;I care about inequality, though. Free markets seem to exacerbate it.

I care about justice. Absolute equality doesn't seem like a noble goal for me and I certainly can't draw a clear line between what degree of inequality should be accepted and what degree of inequality should not be tolerated.

I would much rather live on a system where the rules of the game are the same for everybody and accept the outcome because the rules were the same than live on a system where politicians are allowed to change the rules of the game to favour some at the expense of others and to redistribute the wealth as they see fit - which is often preached to be from the rich to the poor but in the background is always from the people to the politicians and the interest groups that support them.

So while in a freer market some people may end up much wealthier than others (like for example in Switzerland), I prefer that to an interventionist system which incentives corruption and where most people end up more equal but less wealthy and where a much more privileged class of politicians and big companies get incredibly wealthy (like for example in Portugal and in many other social democracies).",0,1388868519,null,0,false,0,cehcgdj,t3_1ue29f,t1_cehcgdj,t1_cehc42x,null,1431799184,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

If I were living in a real democratic country, I would. 

But the problems with Romanian ""democracy"" are:

* creating a party requires way too many signatures (25.000 and at least a thousand from each of 25 counties)
* the participation tax in the elections is way too expensive (IIRC, it's around half a million €; you get it back if you win any seats)
* if you don't get any seats for a couple of consecutive elections, your party is automatically disbanded
* no real independent press; any independent candidate (outside the Social-Democrats and Democratic-Liberals cliques) would get a literally zero press exposure, even if there it had a large grassroot campaign (as shown during the last Bucharest mayoral elections)
* zero electoral debates; the mainstream parties refuse any kind of debates, even among them (between the SD and DL parties).
* electoral fraud: both major parties do it and it's well known and documented
* infiltration by the the secret services; the secret services are used only for political gains of the mainstream parties and they have a lot of resources. They were caught red-handed spying on journalists and politicians, even inflitrating newspaper staffs.
* intimidation by the mobster-politicians of the two mainstream parties

Politicians in heavy regulated countries (like for example in Brazil) basically run the economy, everything must go through them and so they can fill in their pockets with bribes or nothing gets done because of the bureaucratic mess. Politicians in countries like mine try to make everything appear in order but there's always evidence of them colluding with business interests like for example when they pass legislation which makes it more difficult for new companies to enter the market or when they create some regulatory agency but it only goes after smaller companies which all help businesses that are already set up and then you also see relatives of politicians being hired in companies which have an interest on what the politician is deciding, donations to media groups to favour more some parties or criticise others or for example politicians retiring and then being offered a job in some company they used to regulate.

This doesn't happen in countries like Switzerland, if there's very little to regulate then there's also very little to bribe politicians for, companies focus not on lobbying but in competition and try to offer the best service, meaning that consumers benefit.

So it goes into a cycle of investors refusing to invest, growth declines and turns negative, Consumption/spending goes down due to loss of growth, leading to a cycle of bankruptcies and rising unemployment.

What's happening in europe is not intentional, but one thing that differs from previous recessions in europe is that countries with control of their own monetary policy IE: Currency can use monetary policy to expand money within the economy and then pullout when growth returns.

However europe is under control of the ECB whose only mandate is price stability not maximization of employment unlike most other central banks which has both mandates.

And technically ECB could still boost european economies with monetary policy but not because of germany, the german party the FDP even sued the ECB for draghi saying he'll do whatever it takes to save the euro. 

Plus Interest rates in europe is at an all time low. BUT, interest rates being low only means that its cheaper to borrow from other banks and the central bank. But when there is no demand to borrow to invest due to lack of investments. Then interest rates aren't very useful.  

On the otherhand sweden is technically using negative interest rates to expand its economy, negative interest rates makes it expensive for banks and financial institutions to keep their money within the central bank so they have to loan on an loss, and this actually boosts the economy by forcing businesses to invest.

&gt;I believe that it is similar to the terrorist scare in the US, where the government used it to get implicit consent from the population to strip its rights in exchange for the promise of protection

The trend for bodies with significant devolution of powers (like the US, EU, UK, all the historical forms of what is now Germany) is to take greater powers for themselves when the situation demands. But is that a bad thing? The US took a greater roll in people's lives to combat the Great Depression and later World War Two. Was that a bad thing? Washington never gave those powers back to the states or to the people and the states nor the people never asked for them back.

People are inherently opposed to even mildly dangerous change in times of peace and stability, even when there's a chance of an even better future. It's a very logical frame of mind to be in, ie not taking risks you don't need to. But when crises happen the status quo ain't so great (eg 1914, 1931, 2008) and so it becomes acceptable to take a mild risk in order to maintain peace and stability. That risk being the transfer of powers from your local bodies to more powerful, more central ones. Then this becomes the new status quo and people become very pleased with it. It's brought them stability, peace and prosperity. 

The EU is the answer to the crisis we have been facing since 2008. Banking Union and more centralised control will be the answer but people wouldn't accept it until the times demanded it, which is why now most peoples of Europe are tacitly accepting it, just like has happened many times before in the history of democracy. This is a democracy and we can stop the process at any time, if a majority of people decide so. This isn't a dictatorship. 

It's an interesting point of discussion I think a lot of people simply assume is bad without considering it more thoroughly. This is my hastily typed and tiredly written contrary point of view.

-Why are people concerned? Then certainly they need it; then more Rolls Royces will be here. Until they stop asking me, more and more Rolls Royces are going to be here. Now it has to be seen that it is a challenge: the day nobody asks me about Rolls Royces, they will not be coming.
People's interest in Rolls Royces shows their mind. They are not interested what is happening here. They don't ask about meditation, they don't ask about sannyas, they don't ask about people's life, love, the laughter that happens in this desert. They only ask about Rolls Royces. That means I have touched some painful nerve. And I will go on pressing it till they stop asking.

That party will then form a government and react to events as they come in a way compatible with your and their ideology. It's the big ideas that matter, not the specifics.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;So you are saying that the bonds will fix Greece? A banking union is going to fix the productivity in Greece? How, in detail please? The bonds are going to fix the internal devaluation in the south? How, in detail please?

*Nothing* was going to fix Greece in six months. Why do you put the bar above stratosphere? Why should the Euro be able to magically cure any economic ailment? If Greece still had the Drachma, they would still have had a debt crisis. And what then? Devalue? To get a debt cut similar to the 50% they achieved during negotiations, they would have had to devalue with 50%... i.e. all imported goods would cost 100% more. Do you really think the people of Greece would have fared better in that situation?

&gt;There are far to many assymetric shocks, internal devaluation

Internal devaluation is what you get when you refuse transfers. It's a cure, not a problem.

&gt;The Eurzone is not a good currency union.

It wasn't because of the inflation paranoia and paranoid attitude of some rich countries. The euro crisis basically ended when Draghi said: ""the ECB will do anything necessary to keep the Euro afloat"". At that point stability returned.
 
Now the ECB can more or less play its role as the lender of last resort, and financial gamblers trying to corner a single European state in times of trouble will have to face the risk of all their owned debts turning into thin air. Now the banking union is coming too, and the banks will no longer be able to count on an individual state bailing them out. We're progressing.

&gt;and yet you expect them to compete having a currency that is essentially adjusted to the needs of the north, mainly Germany

That's a problem, the ECB still issues too little money. Now that we're nearing deflationary territory they'll hopefully be calmed enough to let the reins float a little. On the bright side, that means the ECB now has room to create about 1% of the EUzone GDP in euros.

&gt;And, you also forget, the bonds cements that the Eurozone do not care one bit about treaties and the law. One is not supposed to put in conditions like that, nor take over anyones debt or bail anyone out according to the current treaties.

I find that argument a bit disingenuous. You complain that the Euro isn't an effective currency but would refuse to give them the legal tools it needs to be one.

And what then? A return to national currencies? And what then? How much will they like the devaluations... I totally agree that the EU lacks a social dimension, a EU-wide health insurance for example would be great. But if you think that national governments somehow are better able to shield the people from the international markets, I am obliged to laugh in your face to cure you of that notion.

&gt;More on point though: the ECB might just be the only EU-wide institution that actually operates properly. The system as constructed might be okay, but the banks themselves are holding untold billions of useless paper/non-performing assets off-balance sheet. In essence that crap renders many of the big banks insolvent in the long run.

Des gens qui travaillent sur l'informatique quantique, ça fait déjà quelques décennies que ça existe. Mais la route est longue, sinueuse, et l'opinion générale de la communauté scientifique sur le sujet en ce moment c'est « on est de moins en moins sûrs qu'on va arriver à quelque chose ». Y'a plusieurs raisons à ça.

1) Les modèles théoriques de l'informatique quantique existent depuis 25 ans déjà, mais si un algorithme très intéressant a été créé pour factoriser un entier [1](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithme_de_shor), c'est à peu près tout ce qu'on sait pour l'instant faire de vraiment bien avec. Or, factoriser un grand entier peut effectivement permettre de casser un nombre important de systèmes de chiffrement, tous ne se basent pas sur ce problème, loin de là.

2) On est pas du tout sûrs d'arriver à construire un ordinateur qui fonctionne bien conformément au modèle. Pour l'instant, on a réussi à faire fonctionner « en vrai » l'algorithme susmentionné… Pour factoriser 15 = 5×3. Et ça a pris des années d'ingénierie et de réglages physiques - un pote a fait son stage là-bas, le nombre de problèmes rencontrés en pratique est démentiel. Une société américaine a récemment créé un ordi quantique présenté comme faisant fonctionner beaucoup plus de qubits que les machines précédentes [2](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Wave), mais on sait pas si ils ont bien les bonnes propriétés. Mon précédent maître de stage, par exemple, qui connaît un rayon dans le domaine, a l'air persuadé que c'est de l'esbrouffe.

3) Supposer donc que la NSA soit à un tel niveau suppose donc qu'ils aient à la fois construit leur propre machine dont personne n'a entendu parler avant, qui a les bonnes propriétés et qui est suffisamment grosse. Ça voudrait dire qu'ils possèderaient une quantité vraiment, vraiment phénoménale de résultats *théoriques* donc le reste du monde ne dispose pas. Or, s'ils ont de bons analystes et ingénieurs dans leurs rangs, ça serait curieux qu'ils puissent réunir autant de physiciens et d'informaticiens branchés sur des problèmes théoriques. Ça aurait été un calcul plus que super hasardeux de leur part de monter un tel projet, et je vois vraiment pas comment ils auraient pu garder ça secret (des gens qui disparaissent subitement du monde de la recherche pour aller bosser avec un gouvernement, ça se remarque).

4) Parce que les imprécisions scientifiques dans les journaux ça me fait frémir, je me sens obligé de relever. Non le RSA est pas « un code de chiffrement parmi les plus complexes », l'algorithme utilisé est compréhensible pour un élève de Terminale S. Si du jour au lendemain RSA est cassé ça va foutre un sacré bazar (et je doute que ça passe inaperçu) mais des algorithmes de cryptographie ou de hachage qui n'utilisent pas de l'arithmétique simple comme RSA mais d'autres outils mathématiques ne dépendant pas de cette fameuse factorisation d'entiers, les cryptologues en ont en réserve [3](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3)[4](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographie_sur_les_courbes_elliptiques).

5) De toute façon, dans la vraie vie, les problèmes de sécurité viennent en très, très, très grande partie des implémentations et non des protocoles sous-jacents. Lorsqu'un protocole théorique est cassé c'est l'évènement de la décennie dans le milieu académique, et ça arrive de moins en moins puisqu'aujourd'hui on arrive à prouver mathématiquement des propriétés de sécurité sur des protocoles. Lorsqu'un logiciel X ou Y est cassé ça ne surprend personne parce qu'un développeur relu par une poignée de monde est quand même moins fiable qu'un truc prouvé avec un assistant de preuve comme Coq [5](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq_(assistant_de_preuve)) et relu par les reviewers d'une grande revue de crypto.

En résumé : la machine qui casse tout, ça n'existe pas et ça n'existera probablement jamais, à moins qu'on arrive à montrer que P = NP [6](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_%3D_NP) mais ça semble plus qu'improbable, et surtout, c'est pas une technique d'approche qui semble pertinente pour la NSA. La machine quantique qui casse RSA ça arrivera peut-être un jour mais ça semble franchement invraisemblable que ça soit la NSA qui y arrive la première et surtout, sans que personne soit au courant.

En résumé un peu moins sympa : les journaleux sont tous des abrutis qui pondent des papiers à la chaîne sur des sujets qu'ils ne connaissent pas sans prendre la peine d'interroger les gens qui savent de quoi ils parlent. C'est bien triste, parce que ce genre d'imprécision rend d'autant moins crédible les *vraies* révélations importantes et autrement plus réelles et flippantes, par exemple ici [7](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/10/new-documents-show-how-the-nsa-infers-relationships-based-on-mobile-location-data/) (traduction médiocre en français là [8](http://www.slate.fr/monde/81049/nsa-relations-individus-localisation-telephones)).  Si la réponse à la question « pourquoi la géolocalisation c'est effroyablement flippant, au-delà de tout ce qu'on peut imaginer » ne vous paraît pas évidente, allez voir par ici [9](http://www.internetactu.net/2013/06/25/peut-on-fouiller-les-donnees-des-telephones-mobiles-en-respectant-la-vie-privee/) ou, beaucoup plus édifiant mais en anglais, par là [10](https://www.aclu.org/meet-jack-or-what-government-could-do-all-location-data).

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;I find that argument a bit disingenuous. You complain that the Euro isn't an effective currency but would refuse to give them the legal tools it needs to be one. I'm glad the ECB eventually did what it needed to do.

Where do I refuse? I point out that you don't have the legal tools, and *until you have changed the law* you should follow it. Or are you saying as soon as one doesn't like the law, one should just ignore it? Why aren't the Eurozone following the law? Why aren't you trying to change the treaty and the ECB statues throught democratic process? You have had over a decade - why? Is it OK for everyone to ignore the treaty and the law if you can? Why, or why not?  

&gt;That's a problem, the ECB still issues too little money. Now that we're nearing deflationary territory they'll hopefully be calmed enough to let the reins float a little. On the bright side, that means the ECB now has room to create about 1% of the EUzone GDP in euros.

Yes, but that will hardly solve the problem. They are not allowed to go above 2 % nor do an aggressive politics like the Fed or the Bank of England (which have aided in the US and the UK recovery), the only thing the ECB is looking at is inflation. Furhtermore, the ECB is breaking the law and its statues when they are protecting individual countries, like Italy, that is forbidden. I think it is extremely worrying to have a huge central bank that is just played at will, not caring about the statue and the law, just doing what it want, not caring at all about the law. How can anyone build a trustworthy currency from that. 

&gt;Nothing was going to fix Greece in six months. Why do you put the bar above stratosphere? Why should the Euro be able to magically cure any economic ailment? If Greece still had the Drachma, they would still have had a debt crisis. And what then? Devalue? To get a debt cut similar to the 50% they achieved during negotiations, they would have had to devalue with 50%... i.e. all imported goods would cost 100% more. Do you really think the people of Greece would have fared better in that situation?

No, they would not have the same debt crises, since they would not have been able to borrow at the low Eurozone interest rates, but would have had the interest rate they had before, 6-7 %. Furthermore, they would not suffer from internal devaluation. Also, their lower productivity would be offset by lower prices, so they would not have the unemployment they have now. Also, they would have their faith in their own hands. 

&gt;Internal devaluation is what you get when you refuse transfers. It's a cure, not a problem.

Not if the cure kills the patient. Over 30 % unemployment is not a cure. Also, it will go on for decades. I mean, it has been going on for five years already, and it is not like they are becoming more productive in 2015. Or 2016, or....Think of DDR/BRD. DDR were far less productive (to say the least) and they had the D-mark. To offset that, Germany made investments of *trillions*, but also kept their social system going, health care, schools etc. 24 years after the reuninon, DDR is still after West Germany. I mean, one can't expect Greece et al to become as productive as the north (since the currency is suited to them) in less than two decades or maybe three. True, they are not DDR, obviously, but they are not receiving any social transfers or investment, only debt and austerity. So, if the cure take three decades - will Greece still live then? 

&gt;It wasn't because of the inflation paranoia and paranoid attitude of some rich countries. The euro crisis basically ended when Draghi said: ""the ECB will do anything necessary to keep the Euro afloat"". At that point stability returned.

What? When?

He then goes on to claim that the term far right is pasted over anything anti-EU...I mean common. That ain't even the least bit true. Correct me if I'm wrong but if he in the end just wants many of the anti EU parties to loose their label of radical he would be better of not citing parties like the Syriza as examples...

And somehow....somehow in all of this he ~~manages~~ thinks he can put the pirate party in front of his sled? At no point have they uniformly gone against the existence of the Eurozone or the EU as a whole. Most of them seem to want reform, democratization and have criticize the current way of doing things but in no way can they be grouped with the Syriza,the Five Stars or the PVV on that basis.

If so, 2 hours may not be enough depending on the ticket line.  Also, if you don't have your heart set on going to the top... consider cutting that time down to an hour just to walk around it or sit in the lawn and relax, etc.  And go to the top of Sacre Ceour (which is in the neighborhood of where you're staying!) or the Arc d'Triumphe.  As for the Rodin museum... I could take it or leave it.  I had the director of my art department in college with me so I got to hear a lot of additional background info on things which was interesting.  Otherwise, I might not have enjoyed it as much.  The grounds and house is neat but I wouldn't have been upset to miss it.

The Louvre is a *very* large museum... very... 2 hours will be ok if all you want to see are the big 3 things.  Also, remember... ticket lines... so unless you have a museum pass (which lets you skip those lines and go straight in) I'm not sure 2 hours is enough.  You may want to do some rearranging between days 2 &amp; 3.  The Pont Neuf bridge and Tuileries Gardens are literally right next door to the Louvre.  The gardens are like the Louvre's backyard.  And really, if you're going from Notre Dame to the Louvre, you could just go back across the river, walk down a couple blocks, cross on the Pont Neuf then another block or two and you're at the Louvre.

I would highly recommend a museum pass for such a short, ambitious visit.  It will get you into the Louvre, Rodin museum, Notre Dame, Pantheon, d'Orsay, Sainte Chapelle, top of the Arc d'Triomphe (which also has a nice view city and less of a wait than the eiffel tower), and a lot more.


For Sainte Chapelle (which is what you're calling the holy chapel???), be warned... it is inside the palace of justice which requires you to go through airport style security screenings... metal detectors, xrays for your bags, no weapons and things allowed... the line for that is long and slow.  After you get through that, *then* you have to get in line to get tickets for the chapel.  Again, your museum pass lets you skip this line.  The chapel is worth it though.  Beautiful.  I would do this first thing in the morning.  Notre Dame may have a line 

**EDIT** apparently I stopped mid thought?

Notre Dame may have a line later in the day, but it should move quickly.  It's not a ticket line.  They just try to control the number of people inside at one time.

Around the interwar years and immediately thereafter, tax rates around 75 and 77% were quite common in America.

The US was very prosperous at that time.

The article points out a number of French government programs that might well be wasteful, but I don't see a clear historical correlation between high income tax rates on top earners and economic decline.

Of course people will complain about taxes, but they will go where the jobs are.  If France can tailor its spending towards job creation, the employees will follow, even if they are making less than before.  And money not spent on exorbitant salaries will be invested, which is probably better for the economy.

&gt; la religion n'est autre qu'une philosophie parallèle à celle des penseurs traditionnels occidentaux, et qu'elle devrait être considérée comme tel ?

Absolument. Le problème, ce sont les institutions politiques, mais religion ou pas, c'est pareil. Après les religions incorporent souvent des traditions locales, comme par exemple ici avec le voile. Et le politique va souvent s'appuyer sur les religions pour manipuler et faire la guerre, mais faire la guerre pour la démocratie en Afghanistan ou faire la guerre pour la religion, ce sont au final toujours les mêmes luttes de pouvoir ou d'influence.

&gt;Quels sont ces bienfaits de la religion dont tu parles ?

J'aime bien le mépris de l'argent et des possessions matérielles dans le catholicisme, la méfiance du monde visible héritée de Platon, le doute et la remise en cause permanente du judaïsme, le sens du devoir et l'exemplarité protestante. La religion permettait d'enseigner de manière imagée et souvent réactualisée ces philosophies, et de les traduire par des actes via les traditions. C'était particulièrement bénéfique quand 95% de la population était analphabète. 

Après, spécifiquement sur le judaïsme, le mieux est de regarder [cette conférence](http://www.akadem.org//sommaire/themes/politique/economie/crise-economique/le-capitalisme-peut-il-etre-moral-23-06-2010-8195_199.php), en particulier Attali à partir de 23 minutes (partie ""Scandale de la richesse ou scandale de la pauvreté"").

Principalement la patience, car ce sont des philosophies qui ne sont pas dans l'instant, mais s’inscrivent dans la durée et au-delà des frontières.

Young educated men, especially underemployed ones who grew up in middle-class homes, is a demographic group that is usually highly susceptible to extremism.

But to ask whether Europe will *""surpass the U.S. as the world's super power""*? Well.....let's look at the facts:

Europe, as it is now, has a [ageing population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_Europe) which it desperately needs to correct. It has a decrease in fertility, a decrease in mortality rate, and a higher life expectancy, all of which will only stress and put more burden on many European countries economies *(as well as increase their debt)*. [By 2050, an estimated 35% of the European population will be over the age of 60.](http://www.thematuremarket.com/SeniorStrategic/ageing_population_european_facts-6204-5.html)

Compare this to the United States, which has a [population growth rate](https://www.google.com/search?q=United+States+Population+growth&amp;oq=United+States+Population+growth&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.7604j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8) close to 3.5x that of [Europe](http://www.indexmundi.com/european_union/population_growth_rate.html).  By 2050 close to [20% of the population](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/776.full) is predicted to be over the age of 60, which while not ideal, is still 15% better than Europe, or, in short, a 1/5th of the American population compared to Europe's 1/3rd. 

Economically, we are also faring rather well.  [America came out of the recession four years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Great_Recession), the European Union did as well, but had [a double-dip recession](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/15/eurozone-double-dip-recession) shortly afterwards, [which it only exited from last August](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/13/eurozone-exit-double-dip-recession). In short, we *(America)* still have years of growth *(albeit small)* while Europe as a whole still has years of recession/loss looming over it's head. We've reached pre-2008 levels this year IIRC, but Europe still has a long way to go before it regains the ground it's lost.

&gt;Plus, America had a 2012 [GDP growth of 2.2%](https://www.google.com/search?q=u.s.+gdp+growht&amp;oq=u.s.+gdp+growht&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65l2j69i60j69i61j69i60.9043j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8#es_sm=122&amp;espv=210&amp;q=united+states+gdp+growth&amp;safe=off), compared to the European Union's projected 2012 [GDP growth of .2%](http://rt.com/business/eu-gdp-q3-eurostat-707/) (remember, it was in recession in 2012). Hence our economy is growing at something like 12x that of Europe. And our 2013 growth numbers are supposed to be even higher, so expect that number to rise. If IIRC, we're even projected to surpass the European Union's economy by 2020.

And, you know, all of that aside, Europe ""getting it's shit together"" would have to include all member states to agree on a common foreign policy, to integrate militarily *(or at least allow the European Union to field a military)*, increase military spending *(or allow the European Union to tax to fund military spending)*, a break-away from NATO *(not completely, just be less reliant)* and the willingness to actually use that hard power *(or at least seem willingly and able)*...if you know...you actually want to be a ""Super Power"" *(or even a Great Power)*. Outside of France and Britain, nobody really seems willing to use hard power, and Britain vocally renounces any idea of a unified European Union military, or independent European Union military in itself. And I'm sure Germany, with it's huge influence, would be a huge thorn in the side of any move to use the European Union's hard power. 

I mean, it could barely project power without extensive help form the United States in Libya, a operation that Europe instigated and called for itself and which the United States was reluctant at first to get involved in, plus in addition, it required additional U.S. support, although much smaller, in Mali:

[Libya, Europe and the future of NATO: Always waiting for the U.S. Cavalry](http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2011/06/libya-europe-and-fuure-nato)

&gt;America was visibly reluctant to get involved, let alone lead the action. And, having helped to knock out Libya's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes, it pulled back from the front-line operations. But America's role remains essential, not least in providing air-to-air refuelling, as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the European allies.

Also....all the sovereignty that countries would have to sacrifice to achieve all that....heh.....I really hope it happens, I do, because Europe's fate in this new century fully depends on it's choices in the next decade.

&gt;[America came out of the recession four years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Great_Recession), the European Union did as well, but had [a double-dip recession](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/15/eurozone-double-dip-recession) shortly afterwards, [which it only exited from this August](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/13/eurozone-exit-double-dip-recession). In short, we *(America)* still have years of growth *(albeit small)* while Europe as a whole still has years of recession/loss looming over it's head. We've reached pre-2008 levels this year IIRC, but Europe still has a long way to go before it regains the ground it's lost.

I contend this to be honest. Even with a fully united and integrated Europe I believe the United States, if it plays it's cards right, will remain the top power in the West. To quote another post I made in this thread about this very subject:

&gt;Europe, as it is now, has a [ageing population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_Europe) which it desperately needs to correct. It has a decrease in fertility, a decrease in mortality rate, and a higher life expectancy, all of which will only stress and put more burden on many European countries economies *(as well as increase their debt)*. [By 2050, an estimated 35% of the European population will be over the age of 60.](http://www.thematuremarket.com/SeniorStrategic/ageing_population_european_facts-6204-5.html)

&gt;Compare this to the United States, which has a [population growth rate](https://www.google.com/search?q=United+States+Population+growth&amp;oq=United+States+Population+growth&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.7604j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8) close to 3.5x that of [Europe](http://www.indexmundi.com/european_union/population_growth_rate.html).  By 2050 close to [20% of the population](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/776.full) is predicted to be over the age of 60, which while not ideal, is still 15% better than Europe, or, in short, a 1/5th of the American population compared to Europe's 1/3rd. 

&gt;Economically, we are also faring rather well.  [America came out of the recession four years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Great_Recession), the European Union did as well, but had [a double-dip recession](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/15/eurozone-double-dip-recession) shortly afterwards, [which it only exited from last August](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/13/eurozone-exit-double-dip-recession).

We have 12x times the economic growth, 3.5x the population growth and a much more centralized &amp; integrated government structure. If we maintain this, I think we can honestly compete with a united Europe. Unless, as another poster in the thread pointed out, we get worse and Europe get's better at the same time, but I doubt this will happen.

Yea, the US does want Europe to do more militarily, but not within a framework that challenges NATO. The US would support greater cooperation, and most importantly, greater military spending, by European states. Any strong Common Security and Defense Policy, that includes a mutual defense clause, such as NATO's Article V, would raise red flags in Washington. The US wants the EU to be the junior partner in the West, not an equal, and certainly not the senior.

&gt;I contend this to be honest. Even with a fully united and integrated Europe I believe the United States, if it plays it's cards right, will remain the top power in the West.

I absolutely agree. The US has a lot of things in its favor that help it increase its power and influence significantly. Although I'm a social democrat, I greatly appreciate some of the aspects of classical liberalism in the US. The US is arguably still the most innovative and dynamic economy in the world, and even though there will be a time when both the EU and China have larger economies, they aren't as diverse or as much of a controlling power as the American economy. (I think I've worded this poorly, but think of it this way: the Chinese economy is built far, far too heavily on manufacturing for the West. If the US were to suddenly stop buying things from China, their economy would implode. The reverse is not true, though a Chinese economic collapse would hurt the US. The US brought the entire rich world into recession in 2008. The Eurocrisis of the past several years, however, has not forced the American economy into recession.

I'm an advocate of a federal EU, with a centralized armed forces, but even with a federal structure as strong as that of the United States, the EU would almost assuredly not be America's equal in terms of global power and influence. The US has too many unique advantages that Europe does not have.

In order for us to be able to surpass the US, we first have to ask ""by what measure""? Without this, the question is ill-defined.

Should we aim for more land than the United States? I do not think so. Should we aim to break their military superiority? Why, as long as we can make sure we are defended from external threats, including the US itself? Should we try to have a bigger absolute GDP? We already do!

But none of the above really tells you much about a future of the EU that would mean anything to the *actual* future, the one that draws nearer and nearer with each passing second. The one in which our short-sightedness condemns our great-grandchildren to further demise, struggle and, ultimately, death. 

To strive to be the next hyperpower would be, in the end, just an amassing of power without one iota of thought as to why and how it should be used to prevent such fate as described above. Instead, we must be willing to work in order to become something new, something that will better this world. 

In short: before we ask by what measure we must overcome the current superpower, we must ask *what we should become*. 

The European Union is a rather fragile, but also novel entity in international affairs. We have not grown by domination, but by offering co-operation: if Britain decides to leave the Union, there shall be no tanks, there must be no economic restrictions that are motivated by politics. Yet, a whole people have struggled for months now for the mere *chance* to belong to us!

While nobody must mistake our unwillingness to fight for the inability to do so, the European Union can show the world that co-operation and trade has cleared away the demons of old for good, at least in Europe itself. It can show the world that a highly developed human society, both in economics as well as in social terms, can be sustainable. And all of this, without falling into tyranny, either inwards or outwards.

We must be nothing less than a model for how all of humanity *could* (not must!) live.

I have no doubts that, right now, we are not in such a position.

I'm not talking about terrorists. I specifically said countries.

It is understandable, fucked up, but understandable. Although you are right about GLONASS and Compass, however I believe this was before they were implemented. And to play devil's advocate, if the United States shot down the satellites for those during a war, we might feel threatened that the enemy could utilize Galileo, hence the ultimatum that a frequency be made that we can jam during war or else we would shot down Galileo's satellites. If you weren't our allies, I doubt we would of afforded ya'll this choice.

And we're not controlling our allies. We're influencing them. The same way the British influence Commonwealth countries or the French influence Africa through Françafrique. It's been like this since we helped rebuild Western Europe with the Marshall Plan and garrisoned the Fulda Gap for half-a-century.

We're allowed to do this given the heavy role we play in Europe's defense &amp; military ability *(Libya &amp; the late intervention in The Balkans would've never been possible without the United States)*. Our assistance was also critical, although much diminished in comparison to the other two, in Mali. Because, you see, whether you like it or not, Europe can not project power against well-armed and defended foes, hence they rely on us significantly through NATO for power projection.

If you don't like this, **fine**. Increase military spending *(even if it's at the expense of some social benefits if you are unable to handle the debt)* and integrate further into the European Union militarily, as well as convincing the member states of the E.U. to adopt a Common Foreign and Defense Policy, or better than all that, create a independent E.U. military. 

If you don't want to do that, and you don't want to sacrifice anything for more military spending, or if you just don't want to increase your military spending because of principle...well...**stop bitching**. Because as of this moment, you are under a security umbrella funded by the United States, hence the influence we wield. And it looks like, since both France and the United Kingdom, the only two other nations in Europe capable of projecting power, are making significant military cuts, you'll only end up that much more indebted to that security umbrella, and that much more able to be influenced by my country.

E questo, come si è detto, nonostante le prime quattro proprietà appaiano del tutto ragionevoli.


Mentre su [wiki](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teorema_dell'impossibilit%C3%A0_di_Arrow):

&gt;l teorema di Arrow è un risultato matematico, ma è spesso espresso in termini non matematici, con affermazioni come: nessun sistema di voto è equo, qualunque sistema di voto può essere manipolato, o il solo sistema di voto non manipolabile è la dittatura. Queste affermazioni rappresentano semplificazioni del risultato di Arrow che non sono considerate corrette da tutti.
Arrow usa il termine fair (equo) con riferimento ai suoi criteri. In effetti alcuni di essi, quali l'ottimo paretiano o la richiesta di assenza di imposizioni, possono apparire banali. Non così, ad esempio, per il criterio dell'indipendenza dalle alternative irrilevanti. Si consideri il seguente esempio: Dave, Chris, Bill e Agnes concorrono per uno stesso posto di lavoro; si supponga che Agnes abbia un chiaro vantaggio rispetto agli altri concorrenti. Ora, in base al risultato di Arrow, si potrebbe avere una situazione in cui, se Dave si ritira, Bill, e non Agnes, ottiene il posto. Ciò potrebbe apparire non equo a molti; tuttavia il teorema di Arrow implica che situazioni di questo tipo non possono in generale essere evitate.

Do you want to be a consolidated supranational union *(or, in other words, a full-fledged nation-state basically)* or a loose confederation of nations? 

You can't be both. Which is why the European Union is on such a troubled path I believe. It wants to have it's cake and eat it too, and it can't do that. The direction it's going in, in my opinion, is reminiscent of a car without a driver. 

What also perplexes me is the rate at which the European Union is attempting to expand. If it wants to consolidate into a *""ever, closer union""*, how can it possibly do that when it's adding different members every year, at different stages of integration, and with different levels of motivation *to* integrate? It's hard enough convincing present members to give up bits &amp; pieces of their national sovereignty, so is it really clever to throw more balls in the air while you're doing that?

The European Union has a identity crisis. And that needs to be fixed before anything else.

&gt;America was visibly reluctant to get involved, let alone lead the action. And, having helped to knock out Libya's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes, it pulled back from the front-line operations. But America's role remains essential, not least in providing air-to-air refuelling, as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the European allies. 

[NATO Commander: EU could not do Libya without US](http://euobserver.com/defence/115650)

&gt;NATO Major-General Marcel Druart, addressing the European Parliament committee on security and defence on Tuesday (20 March), said NATO relied heavily on US military expertise on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.

[French urgency, U.S. caution collide in Mali operation](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/26/us-usa-france-mali-idUSBRE90P04N20130126)

&gt;*(Reuters)* - France's military intervention in Mali has revived trans-Atlantic tensions over security issues, this time involving a key counterterrorism battlefield, along with dismay from critics who see U.S. President Barack Obama as too reluctant to use military force.

[Dempsey: France formally asks for U.S. aid in Mali](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/17/dempsey-france-formally-asks-for-us-aid-in-mali/)

&gt;The French government has formally requested U.S. military assistance to combat al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in Mali, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the American Forces Press Service on Thursday

[U.S. aiding France's military operation in Mali](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57563710/)

&gt;*BAMAKO, MALI* - France's foreign minister said Sunday that the United States is providing communications and transport help for an international military intervention aimed at wresting Mali's north out of the hands of Islamist extremists.

Also, the last one doesn't even mention the extensive intelligence support we gave the French, nor the Special Forces we put down into Niger, a country which neighbors Mali, and the one which provides up to 20% of France's uranium *(also the realpolitik reason I believe France got involved in Mali in the first place)*.

And let's not forget about [The Balkans](http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/1998/12/balkans-daalder):

&gt;Washington's preference was clear. It repeatedly demanded that the U.N. forces either stop the latest Bosnian Serb assault or, at the very least, agree to NATO air strikes to punish the Serb forces and protect the ""safe"" areas. Most European allies had a different view. Unlike the United States, many Europeans had placed their troops at risks by participating in the U.N. operation on the understanding that their involvement would be limited to a strictly humanitarian mandate. When limited air strikes in late May 1995 resulted in nearly 400 peacekeepers being taken hostage, a consensus quickly emerged within the U.N. and among the troop-contributing countries that, however limited, NATO air strikes would do more harm than good. 

So this happened: 

[Srebrinca Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre)

&gt;The Srebrenica massacre, also known as the Srebrenica genocide, refers to the July 1995 killing, during the Bosnian War, of more than 8,000 Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), mainly men and boys, in and around the town of Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina, by units of the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) under the command of General Ratko Mladić. The mass murder was described by the Secretary-General of the United Nations as the worst crime on European soil since the Second World War. A paramilitary unit from Serbia known as the Scorpions, officially part of the Serbian Interior Ministry until 1991, participated in the massacre and it is alleged that foreign volunteers including the Greek Volunteer Guard also participated.

Right under the nose of Dutch peacekeepers, who knew exactly what was happening yet did not move because they were ordered not to. 

Which led back to [this](http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/1998/12/balkans-daalder):

&gt;Srebrenica was the West's greatest shame, with each of the 7,079 lives lost underscoring the failure to act in time to avert this single most genocidal act of the Bosnian war. Guilt led senior representatives of the United States and its key allies to agree in London a few days later that NATO would make a strong stand at Gorazde by defending the town's civilian population. (This decision was later extended to the three other remaining 'safe' areas of Bihac, Sarajevo, and Tuzla; Zepa had earlier fallen to the Bosnian Serbs). The allies agreed that an attack on, or even a threat to, Gorazde would be met with a ""substantial and decisive"" air campaign. ""There'll be no more ""pinprick"" strikes,"" Secretary of State Warren Christopher declared. A few days later, the North Atlantic Council worked out the final operational details of the air campaign and passed the decision to NATO's military commanders on when to conduct the strikes.

Basically Western Europeans powers were unable and unwilling to stop the Bosnian genocide in the 1990s, which was happening in THEIR VERY OWN BACKYARD, until the United States finally stepped in, unfortunately, after thousands had already been slaughtered. 

And if you don't see the implication or value of NATO when the European Union is negotiating with Russia, than, well shit, I can't really help you. Just because you don't use your army doesn't mean you derive no value from your army. I know Sun Tzu or someone said that shit a lot more elegantly than I just did, but it's the truth. You can have all the soft power you want in the world, but it only goes so far without hard power, which for the most part, the United States subsidizes much of in the case of Europe.
