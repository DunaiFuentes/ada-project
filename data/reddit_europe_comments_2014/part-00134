&gt; Høyre seems to lean Left with feminism and egalitarianism

Hehe, there is very little ""feminism"" as such, it's just utilizing our resources optimally (men and women). We've made investements in their education, society should maximize the return (ROI). 

It's a global trend; women have overtaken men in many countries in higher education (in % numbers). 

Another example includes providing cheap kindergartens for all children in the country. It makes it easier for married and single citizens to work full time, while our GDP and productivity increases. It's not feminism, it's economics.

&gt; the Fremskrittspartiet is anti-immigration 

That's just not correct, unfair and very misleading. They're far from pro-immigration, but there is *no* immigration policy in Norway.  Outside of marriage and asylum there is no access [from outside the EU/EEA]. The party is **not** hostile to immigrants, but it does make demands that new residents and refugees *integrate* fully (learning the language, our culture and laws). 

In the past they had a *fringe* of members with less than ""open"" minds, they were kicked out of the party decades ago. Don't make the mistake of comparing Frp with Jobbik (Hungary).

Yes, it's a strange party, but it's clearly a populist/protest party. A result of our abundant wealth and lack of problems?

&gt; The party also has some connections with the American Tea Party movement

Those connections are about as solid as salt in water. Norway is so far left of the US in general that we might as well be ""Communists"".

true,[deleted],null,null,"First of all OP this is a terribly worded post ""Why does France refuse to speak English""- because thats designed with a the conclusion in mind- that France indeed refuses to speak English- which is wrong. 

Let me guess you are referring to this due to the Eurovision issue yesterday? French along with English is one of the two languages of the eurovision. Infact the competition was created in French speaking Switzerland and was originally in French. Thats why the French host presented the results in ~~English~~ French whereas the German one for example, didnt present it in German.

As for your question, like everywhere else there is an effort to learn English in France. France is just not that good at it, but there are concious efforts to improve it in education. Here for example is the frontpage of a very big newspaper advocating more Enlish being used by having the whole newspaper in english for a day- http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dOWaJ73SxEQ/UZxcqneM3bI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/HfJ4H6eqKZg/s1600/BKvMZH7CMAAufMt.jpg .

Apart from that there is a feeling in France to protect the national culture, but that does not mean to restrict teaching English. 

On the other hand we can say why does Germany/England/Netherlands etc refuse to speak Spanish? Your average French (or Italian or Portuguese) student has a much higher level of Spanish than people from Northern Europe as the language has similar roots.

Und betreffend die Zahlen, wie du schon selber angedeutet hast:

&gt; Using UN Comtrade  data  gives  total  values  for  Chinese  SALW  exports  that  are  low  for  a state  that  is  commonly  regarded  as  a  major  exporter  of  SALW  (see  table  4.2). 

&gt;While this discrepancy could be because Chinese SALW exports are sold cheaply  or are gifts of surplus, it is most likely due to the fact that a large number of major  recipients of Chinese SALW do not report their imports to UN Comtrade.

As I recall, he's an English country lord who sees the ghost of Merlin who makes him pick between magical sword and an talisman. He picks the talisman and becomes a superhero: Captain Britain. He has the standard superhero package of powers: superstrength, thick skin, flight. It was later retconned that the talisman (and later, his somewhat better known [costume](http://ifanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/CaptainBritain.jpg)) were actually technology from another dimension. Without the talisman/suit his powers faded from ""awesome"" to ""pretty neat"". In some of the later comics I've seen references that his powers are now tied to confidence, which I feel is a pretty neat kryptonite, as it means he can be beaten with good debate skills. 

After the awkward first adventures the character (and/or his team, The Excalibur) usually fought interdimensional threats, magical foes and some government afflicted secret organisations, and they were generally really creepy or played for laughs. The quality was rather high (the writers, most of whom were either British (Alan Moore, Alan Davis, Warren Ellis..) or British-born (Chris Claremont) and usually the best of their field at the time the comics were published. 

Funfact: for most of it's existence, Captain Britain (and his team, The Excalibur) was published by Marvel's UK subsidiary. The comics felt very ""British"" indeed, at least compared to stuff like 2000 AD, Warrior etc.

(I read these comics over decade ago, so I might remember so details wrong. But I wouldn't say they were cashing on brand, so to say. They were written by Brits, for Brits.)

EDIT: The creator of the character, Chris Claremont, was British-born but raised in the States, which explains the ""country lord"" part.

Unfortunately for them, English is the more important language. But I think this fact should not be overlooked.

I live in Pisa, and I still love to go to see touristy things sometimes and act like an unabashed tourist, because these places become tourist destinations for a reason: they're beautiful and interesting :)  Just try not to inconvenience or disrespect the locals when you do your sightseeing, and there's no problem whatsoever!

Florence:  Less popular stuff: When you walk up to Piazzale Michelangelo (which has great views of the historic centre), you actually walk right pass some lovely rose gardens with art installations which you are free to explore.  If you continue up past Piazzale Michelangelo you can visit the lovely San Miniato church.

There is also a neat little antiques/second hand wares market over in Piazza dei Ciompi on the last Sunday of the month. They had lots of very neat little things to see and possibly purchase!

More popular stuff:

If you also decide to climb up to the cupola of the Duomo, wake up early and get there ASAP. The line gets huge, and it's not very fast.  You can buy a combined ticket for all the other Duomo things at the Cupola entrance (the museo, baptistry, campanile, etc. which saves time).  But if you go to one of the other places you *can't* get a combined ticket which includes the Duomo's Cupola (the top bit).

Rome: Less popular: Well, I'm a huge sap for Bernini, who is an AMAZING sculptor.  So if you're interested in his work you could check out the Villa Borghese which is an incredible museum. You must buy tickets in advance it's very restricted. You can also check out the numerous fountains and churches he worked on (such as the Santa Maria della Vittoria which has one of his most famous sculptures!).

You could also check out the Capuchin Crypt which is beautiful and very macabre. The work of a monk who decorated the crypt using the bones of his predecessors.

Consider booking in advance for a Scavi tour of the Vatican.  They take you down into the old archaeological dig beneath St. Peter's, and after they let you out of the tour you're past the security line (in fact you go in through the staff security for the tour), and you can wait in a much shorter line to see the Vatican stuff. This NEEDS to be done fairly far in advance.

The Appian Way. It can be tricky to get there (the bus from the Baths of Carcalla is *very* inconsistent). But if you don't want to take a taxi, or wait for the bus (I think I waited an hour and a half before I gave up) you can walk the distance. There is a tourist information office right at the start, and they have a very good map there with the monuments and descriptions for the whole road.  There are also two different catacombs here that you can visit (but as a warning.. they close down for lunch!). Ask where the bus stops are along the way (there are only two further down..!).  Most people only walk to the monument of Cecilia Metella... but there is so much more! If you want to see *everything* definitely rent a bike!  While the vast majority you can reach on foot if you have a couple hours, nearing the end of the road there is a LOT of walking between each sight... and since there's no public transportation at the end, remember you'll have to walk all the way back! Also keep in mind that for the most part (especially further down) there is nowhere to buy food or water, and not even necessarily a bathroom... so plan ahead!

There is also the Aqueduct park. If you want to maybe take a packed lunch and just sit under the the old aqueducts and relax for a bit. It's pretty far out of the way, but you can still reach it by metro!

I also like to recommend the Torre Argentina.. it's a ruin in the middle of the city, that now has a cat sanctuary for strays where they provide them with veterinary care, water, and food!  You can go in and play with some of the cats and they always appreciate if you have a donation to help them out!

Anyways, out of your list, those are the only two places I've visited.  I hope you enjoy your trip!

true,Tollaneer,POLA,can into space,"Ok. Let's play this game. Describe, exactly, the border between ""true"" and ""constructed"" language.            
Does it have to be artificial from the bottom? Well, Esperanto isn't. Knowing Italian and French you can practically understand it without learning, because it has strong basis in other languages, just like any other language.        
Is it about way it was made? Ok, it was created by a linguist, but then - when a committee of... let's say Spanish language specialists come together and decide on rules of the language (which is a thing that happens with every major language), isn't that artificial according to that criteria? It's not following a natural course, it's just a bunch of people deciding on a language. Thinking about it like this quickly ends in conclusion that around 18th and 19th every major European language became ""not really alive in the sense a true natural language is"". English you've learned in school and speak is decided on by linguists, just like Esperanto was.              
Is it about age of it? Esperanto is 120 years old and persists. It has stood the test of time.           
Number of users? 1-2 million makes it a strong language.          
It's a clash of few different languages and not 'a real' language? Every language is a clash of what was there before. But if you want a good example, read about origins of Afrikaans, that is basically Dutch combined with whatever language was on spot.             
It isn't linked with a cultural heritage? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_culture https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_literature https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_film https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_music

true,Nym_Indaram,YAFrance,France,"Je réponds un peu tard, désolé.

Je vois ce que tu veux dire. Cependant je pense que tu fais l'amalgame entre le Concept (l'Idée) et le mot. Chaque mot véhicule une certaine Idée. Et c'est exactement pour ça que parfois on cherche un mot. On a l'Idée, que l'on sent mentalement de façon non-définie, mais le mot traîne le temps que le cerveau retrouve le lien. C'est pour cela que tu dis exactement que parfois l'on cherche le mot en Anglais, et qu'on ne le trouve pas en Français. Car dans une langue différente, l'Idée est différente. 

Ainsi en Allemand on peut exprimer des choses que l'on ne peut en Français, car le mot n'existe pas. Pareil avec le Japonais, Anglais, etc. Ce qui m'amène à mon deuxième point, qui est ce que je disais dans mon premier commentaire en fait. Le principe est que le mot forme l'Idée dans ton esprit. 

Par exemple un mot très fort en Allemand est ""Heimat"". Il n'a pas d'équivalent en Français, et ainsi n'existe pas. On peut cependant en donner l'approximation suivante : ""Il désigne à la fois le pays où l'on naît, le village où l'on a grandi, mais aussi la maison où on a passé son enfance ou celle où on est chez soi."" Les Allemands utilisent en permanence ce mot et ce Concept, les personnes Françaises elles, sans l'existence de ce mot n'ont pas de conscience de l'existence de cette Idée, et ne peuvent par conséquent l'avoir. 

Même chose avec les couleurs. Plusieurs études ont relevés un phénomène intéressant. Chaque être humain normalement doté d'yeux peut voir l'infinité des couleurs de l'arc-en-ciel. Mais si l'individu n'a pas appris les noms des différentes teintes et nuances, il ne pourra pas faire la différence entre une dizaine de verts. Une fois appris, il fait sien le Concept et peut l'utiliser et le reconnaître, et ainsi différencier les teintes.

A war with Russia, West against East...that's where you are heading with a sentiment like that.

This conflict can only be solved with Russia together. They have to be heard, their concerns and interests have to be considered and they have to be taken seriously.

The border between a natural and a constructed language in linguistics is actually fairly simple -- a language spoken by a native speaker is a natural language, because that means it can actually function as a real language. Regular Esperanto as spoken by enthusiasts thus isn't a natural language, whereas the Esperanto spoken by its few native speakers is natural.

On top of that, the population argument *is* valid, which is why it would be better for the states to implement healthcare instead of the federal government, particularly since they are the primary governing body in day-to-day matters, and would be able to implement healthcare more effectively than the federal government. The ACA is only useful in that it's prompting states (like [Vermont](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_health_care_reform)) to implement their own healthcare systems.

The ACA (Obamacare) is insurance reform more than healthcare reform. It forces people to buy health insurance, and effectively forces health insurance to cost less.

Ah the usual old russian lie full of shit. 

What happened is (russians) shooters targeted the ultras (russian speaking football club from kharkhiv, which went pro united ukraine/pro kiev as a lesser evil when they got fed up with russian raiders burning/looting/killing/kidnapping their area) with an AK till dozens of people laid on the ground. Unsurprizingly, they (ultra+pro unity locals) got fed up and chased the russians, who took refuge in a building which caught fire during the fight. some died suffocated by the smoke and poor air then burnt.

But listening to you you'd imagine lines of waffen SS yelling ""alarm ! achtung !"" or something like this before dousing them in kerozene. not exactly reality.

1°) calling kiev nazi is just made up bullshit 2°) it was mostly an accident for the burning part (even if the urk didn't exactly ran in the fire to help them out after the russian shooters) 3°) russians shooters tried murdering large numbers of ukr just before

What happened in Odessa was a tragedy. But turning a russian shooter gone wrong into a ""nazi burns people alive !"" is insanely wrong, and an insult to the victims.

Im Unterricht haben wir Deutschland nach der Zweite Weltkrieg studiert. Nach der Krieg Deutschland war getrennt zwischen die BRD im Westen und die DDR im Osten. Deshalb können wir fragen, welche Forme die macht hatte die DDR. Ich werde zwei Dokumente studieren. Das erste Dokument ist eine Szene von  der Film „Das Leben der anderen“. Das zweite ist ein Reportage über den Tag dem Mauerfall.

„Das Leben der anderen“ ist ein Film über die Überwachung in die DDR. Tatsächlich das Regime in die DDR war autoritär. Entgegen die BRD, nach der Zweite Weltkrieg die DDR-Bürger haben nicht Meinungsfreiheit bekommt. Die DDR war ein Teil des Ostblock. Folglich müssen Leute einverstanden mit Kommunismus sein. Die Szene von den Film veranschaulicht diese Aspekt. Es zeigt ein Mann, Wiesler, der für die Stasi arbeitet, und der einbrecht die Wohnung einer Schauspielerin um sie auszuspionieren. Er installiert Wanzen weil er die Gespräche der Schauspielerin abhören will. Somit hofft er Beweise zu finden, weil er vermutet, dass sie eine Republikfeindin ist. Zudem er bleibt immerfort emotionlos, sachliche, und tüchtig. Es zeigt, dass das Regime sehr streng ist, und wird riesig Ressourcen verwenden um die Feinde zu zerstören. Nicht nur können die DDR-Bürger nicht ihre Meinung sprechen, sonder auch steuert das Regime die Medien. Es ist sichtbar in die Szene weil Wiesler findet eine Zeitung, Der Spiegel, versteckt in die Wohnung, trotz es in die DDR verboten ist. Außerdem herrscht das Regime durch streng Überwachung, sondern auch durch Angst. In die Szene bedroht Wiesler die Nachbarin und sagt, dass wenn sie die Schauspielerin erzählt, ihre Tochter will nicht ihre Studium fortsetzen. Somit hat die DDR eine drücke Macht für die Bevölkerung.

Diese Reportage erzählt der Mauerfall in Berlin und Lübeck. Der Berliner Mauer hat am 9. November 1989 gefallen. An diesem Tag waren die West-Deutschen und die Ost-Deutschen endlich wieder vereint. Jedoch, während die Zeit sie hat getrennt vergeht, viele Unterschiede hat erscheint. Tatsächlich sie habe für 20 Jahre mit entgegengesetzt Regimes leben. Die streng Maßnahmen der DDR hat der Osten verspätet gemacht. Das ist sichtbar in der Reportage mit die Trabbis und Wartburg, die typischen Autos der DDR-Bürger sind und die in der Westen Straßen sind an den Mauerfall Tag. Zudem, an diesem Tag, viele DDR-Bürger sind in die BRD gegangen. Die Bilder von der Reportage sind auffallend, weil die große DDR-Bürger Menge zeigt, dass sie waren von der Welt getrennt, und wollen jetzt ein Teil davon sein. Alle die DDR-Bürger in der Reportage sind glücklich, sogar euphorisch. Es zeigt, dass der DDR Regime war nicht geschätzt von die Bevölkerung. In das Video, die DDR-Bürger besuchen Supermärkte, und kaufen Dinge die nicht in die DDR vorliegen. Sie kennen nicht alle die Produkte im Supermarkt, weil die Regime hatte die Kontrolle über alle die Produkte im Osten, sie wollten nicht Produkte von der Westen kaufen. Somit, die Bevölkerung hat 20 Jahre lang von die Welt getrennt sein, weil die Regime wollte nicht kompromittiert von der Westen werden.

Zum Schluss, die DDR hat eine sehr hart Macht Forme benutzen. Sie verwandet Überwachung und Angst um die Bevölkerung zu kontrollieren.

Das erste ist ein Artikel genannt „Mehrsprachigkeit – der moderne Europäer spricht 1+2“, von die Website ifs-kassel. Das zweite Dokument ist eine Reportage über das Erasmus Programm.

Der Artikel ist über die Mehrsprachigkeit in Europa. Heute gibt es mehr als 60 Sprachen in Europa. Aber der Artikel sagt, dass fast halb die Europäer sprechen nur ihre Muttersprache. Das ist nicht eine gute Dinge, tatsächlich wir sind inmitten der Globalisierung. Somit kann Mehrsprachigkeit ein große Vorteil sein, für mehr als kommunizieren. Der Artikel erklärt, dass Mehrsprachigkeit kann Studium, Arbeiten und Reisen erleichtern. Zudem, wegen Globalisierung ist es wichtig die Kultur von anderen Länder zu verstehen, und Sprachkenntnisse ist den ersten Schritt um es zu erreichen. Danach der Artikel sagt, dass die EU hat ihr Sprachenpolitik gestärkt. Seit 2002, sollen Kinder mindestens 2 Fremdsprachen lernen. Das Ziel von diese Maßnahme ist ein Zukunft wo alle EU-Bürger beherrschen 3 Sprachen, die Muttersprache und zwei Fremdsprachen. Es wird ein Vorteil werden, weil alle EU-Bürger wurden gut kommunizieren, und es wird der Austauch erleichtern.

Die Reportage ist über das Erasmus Programm. Das Erasmus-Programm ist ein Programm der Europäischen Union, das organisiert Austausch für junge EU-Bürger während ihre Studium.

Ein Held ist jemand, der großen Errungenschaften getan hat und ist bewundert. Im Unterricht haben wir gesehen, dass der Begriff „Held“ können viele Bedeutungen haben. Deshalb können wir fragen, welche Dingen machen ein Held. Ich werde zwei Dokumente studieren. Das erste Dokument ist ein Artikel von Der Spiegel, über Georg Elser. Das zweite Dokument ist auch ein Artikel über die Bedeutung den Begriff „Held“ in Deutschland.

Der erste Artikel ist genannt „Allein gegen Hitler“ und erzählt Georg Elsers Geschichte. Elser war ein deutscher Möbeltischler. Er ist berühmt weil er hat versucht Hitler zu töten. Dadurch diese Attentat, Elser wollte der Krieg vermeiden. Der Artikel sagt, dass am 8. November 1939 hat eine Bombe explodiert, in München, im Bürgerbräukeller. Unglücklicherweise Hitler hat schon verlassen der Ort. Elser hat vorhergesagt, dass Hitler ein schlechter Mensch war, und, dass er würde Deutschland zum Krieg führen. Folglich hat er während eines vollen Jahrs des Attentat vorbereitet. Er hat seine Bombe allein gemach, um niemand zu gefährden. Nach der gescheitert Attentat, der hat  Leute getötet und verletzt, Elser war in  der Nähe von der Schweizer Grenze verhaftet. Es ist nur am Ende des Krieges, dass Elser wurde hingerichtet. Wir könnten erwarten, dass Elser nach der Krieg anerkannt wird. Aber trotz seiner tapfer Tat, wurde Elser nicht gewürdigt, er wurde verfemt. Leute dachte dass, es eine falsche Geschichte war. Elsers Taten waren dennoch heroisch,weil her hat sein Arbeit und Leben für ein höheres Ziel geopfert. Heutzutage ist Elser nach 70 Jahren gewürdigt und bewundert. Er hat so lange gedauerte vor Elsers Anerkennung, weil die Deutschen will nicht mehr der Begriff „Held“ verwenden nach die Zweite Weltkrieg. Jetzt wissen die Leute schließlich, dass Elser ein großer Deutscher war.

Der zweite Artikel ist genannt „Die neuen deutschen Helden sind anders“. In diese Text ist es erklärt, dass die Bedeutung der Begriff „Held“ hat ausordentlich geändert im Laufe der Zeit. Zuerst, nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg war der Begriff nicht geschätzt in Deutschland. Es ist weil er war missbraucht während der Krieg, folglich hat er Tabu geworden, wie zeigt der vorhergehend Artikel. Jedoch, kann man heute wieder über Helden in Deutschland sprechen. Heutzutage ist die Bedeutung anders als vor dem Krieg. In der Vergangenheit die Definition für ein Held war jemand fähig sich zu opfern, jemand der schützt was er liebt. Jedoch, nach dem Krieg wollen Leute nicht mehr diese Bedeutung benutzen, weil Soldaten hat angeblich gestorben wie Helden, aber sie haben Verbrechen getan. Jetzt der Begriff hat keine echte Bedeutung. Helden sind heute Mitarbeiter, oder  Sportler, oder Künstler. Der übermäßiger Gebrauch der Wort hat es nutzlos gemacht. Deshalb versuchen die Deutschen der Begriff zu aufwerfen. Um es zu machen, die Helden des Alltags müssen anerkannt werden, weil Leute wie Lehrer oder Ärzte helfen eigentlich Leute, und kümmern sie sich nicht mit Ruhm. Der deutsche Held hat ganz geändert, aber jetzt sind die Deutschen nicht mehr unruhig mit der begriff Held, folglich kann der Held wieder bewundert sein.

true,Titanomakhia,ENGL,England,"It's not a retarded comparison necessarily. His numbers sound about right and he's right population is a big difference between small countries and the US. 

The main problem is that his reasonably accurate points are completely irrelevant to the argument he wants to make. He never actually says that 'socialised medicine' can't work on a bigger scale, he just states population numbers as if the conclusion is self-evident. Even if he had stated his hypothesis clearly, which he didn't, then he would still need to provide arguments as to why his hypothesis might be true which he didn't even get close to doing. In fact he sort of did the opposite. 

His argument, if I can imagine what it would be (given he never actually makes one), is that the higher the difference in population between two countries the less likely it is that the same healthcare system will work in both countries or at the very least he's saying that countries with very different population sizes cannot have the same healthcare systems. Except that the difference in population between Finland and the UK is about 12x compared to the difference between the UK and the US which is about 5x meaning that, in this example, where the ratio (US:UK versus UK:Finland) is largest the heathcare systems are the most similar which seems to contradict his implied argument.

true,johannL,null,null,"&gt; Die leichte Möglichkeit des Briefeschreibens muß - bloß theoretisch angesehn - eine schreckliche Zerrüttung der Seelen in die Welt gebracht haben. Es ist ja ein Verkehr mit Gespenstern und zwar nicht nur mit dem Gespenst des Adressaten, sondern auch mit dem eigenen Gespenst, das sich einem unter der Hand in dem Brief, den man schreibt, entwickelt oder gar in einer Folge von Briefen, wo ein Brief den andern erhärtet und sich auf ihn als Zeugen berufen kann. Wie kam man nur auf den Gedanken, dass Menschen durch Briefe mit einander verkehren können! Man kann an einen fernen Menschen denken und man kann einen nahen Menschen fassen, alles andere geht über Menschenkraft. Briefe schreiben aber heißt, sich vor den Gespenstern entblößen, worauf sie gierig warten. Geschriebene Küsse kommen nicht an ihren Ort, sondern werden von den Gespenstern auf dem Wege ausgetrunken. Durch diese reichliche Nahrung vermehren sie sich ja so unerhört. Die Menschheit fühlt das und kämpft dagegen, sie hat, um möglichst das Gespenstische zwischen den Menschen auszuschalten, und den natürlichen Verkehr, den Frieden der Seelen zu erreichen, die Eisenbahn, das Auto, den Aeroplan erfunden, aber es hilft nichts mehr, es sind offenbar Erfindungen, die schon im Absturz gemacht werden, die Gegenseite ist soviel ruhiger und stärker, sie hat nach der Post den Telegraphen erfunden, das Telephon, die Funkentelegraphie. Die Geister werden nicht verhungern, aber wir werden zugrundegehn.

But there are good autobahn connections if you're hiring a car or your SIL can pick you up.

Frankfurt-Hahn Airport (HHN) is closer to K-Town and nowhere near Frankfurt. It's the one used by budget short-haul airlines, so flying into there would probably mean transferring at somewhere like London Heathrow or Stansted. Also, you'd need to either hire a car or get your SIL to pick you up.

You'll find gasoline quite expensive in Europe (your SIL, being military, can get special rates at Esso stations in Germany). Rail travel is excellent (Germans complain about it all the time, but it's actually one of the best systems in Europe), and K-Town itself has good connections to much of southern Germany, and also to Paris.

You write, you want to talk about Mythen and Helden, but you don't talk about Mythen at all and your definition of Mythos is wrong, too. A Mythos is a historical story, a legend. It's not a belief or an idea. It might be unverified, but it's not seen as false. A Mythos is a story, so there is no question about true or false. 

You say, wir können uns fragen, was einen Helden ausmacht. Right, but you don't talk about it. What does make Elser a hero? You describe what happened, but there is no connection to this question: what makes a hero? If you try to remember what is important, you can shorten the description of Elsner's assassination attempt.

You start talking about what happens after the war. Elsners Tat wird nicht anerkannt. He himself is not recognized. You leave out one of the most important parts of the original text. 
Lange schreckte die deutsche Öffentlichkeit vor Elser zurück, denn vielleicht ahnte sie, wie die Historiker Peter Steinbach und Johannes Tuchel schreiben, ""dass es mit der Verkommenheit der politischen Eliten noch schlimmer bestellt gewesen war, als man vermutete, wenn ein einfacher Schreiner den verbrecherischen Charakter des Regimes durchschaut hatte"".
The public doesn't call him a hero, not because it doesn't use the word anymore. It doesn't call him  a hero, because if somebody like him, a common worker, without an education, has seen the criminal character of the regime, what does that say about them? How could they have stood behind this regime? How could they have allowed to happen what happened? So they make something up, they belief the story that he was a fake, that nothing really happened.

I tried to write down what my problem with the second text is, but I can't really find a way to say. I think, you really have to define, what a hero is. What makes a person a hero? Why isn't a ""Held der Woche"" a real hero? And what makes some kind of teacher one?

Because, the meaning of the word hasn't really changed that much. If you leave out those meaningless heroes in the first part of the text.

The problem is, the US is no longer the outlier. Obesity rates in the US are begining to level off, while other nations, including the UK, Australia, New Zealand and others are beginning to catch up. 

You're thinking of the [WHO statistics](http://www.forbes.com/2007/02/07/worlds-fattest-countries-forbeslife-cx_ls_0208worldfat.html), which put the US at 74% overweight and obese. New Zealand is at 68%, Australia at 67%, and the UK at 64%. If you look at trends, in many places, obesity is increasing relatively rapidly compared to the US, which is beginning to level off. So instead of being an American problem, it is quickly becoming a global one. 

I wish they would use a metric other than BMI though, such as body fat %. I have several friends who are at a healthy body fat but have a lot of muscle that are considered obese (one was even offered an underwear modeling job, if that is an indication). I have a healthy body fat and am at the top end of overweight. BMI takes into account weight and height, not what the weight is made of which can be healthy.

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.

* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.

* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)

* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.

* [Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!

* In the [Handwerkerhof](http://www.handwerkerhof.de/en/home.html) you can see how craftsmen create tradtitional products from the area in an medivial environment.

* Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 

* [Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp;amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp;amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.

* [Neues Museum Nürnberg](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neues_Museum_N%C3%BCrnberg) has a great collection of modern and contemporary art and design, for example Andy Warhol.

* [Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 

* [Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing

* In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!

* Nürnberg has ~~a soccer team and~~ a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

* ADIDAS and PUMA have their headquarters and big outlet shopping centres in the small town of Herzogenaurach, 25km north-west of Nuremberg. If you want to go shopping for cheap sportswear (and more), you should consider a visit. Also if you are interested in [modern](http://www.vb.com/puma/puma-hq-herzogenaurach-m.jpg) [architecture](http://www.herzogenaurach.de/typo3temp/pics/e9cc906d7d.jpg).

**Bamberg:**

* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  

* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.

* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the [""Alte Hofhaltung""](http://www.emiksch.de/Lions/2007/Bilder/slides/Bamberg_Alte_Hofhaltung.jpg) where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)

* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""

* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above

* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.

* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.

* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18) as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.spezial-keller.de/index_files/stacks_image_44.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.

* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;amp;num=30&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=de&amp;amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;radius=15000&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.

* Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

* Bamberg is a University Town with currently about 12k Students (at 70k people), so you'll find young people everywhere.

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recommend ""Schäuferla"" :)

**Würzburg:**

* [Würzburger Residenz](http://www.grand-i-tour.de/de/images/git_wuerzburgresi13.jpg) Also some scenes from the three musketeers were shot here

* [Feste Marienburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Festung-Marienberg_1409_10_11.jpg)
Würzburg is in the centre of [franconian wine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia_%28wine_region%29), which is known for its [Bocksbeutel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bocksbeutel.jpg)

* Würzburg has a Basketball team in the highest german league.

* The University of Würzburg has about 25k students enrolled, the city if full of them ;)

**Bayreuth:** 

* [The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)

* [The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see

* Bayreuth has a Basketball team in the highest german league. As you see, franconia is quite strong in german basketball with 3 teams.

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live (0,5 litre of beer: beginning at 1,50€), and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car, but there are is a list of [bus lines](http://vgn.de/freizeitlinien/) (german link) that are esp. for recreational/free time destinations like wildlife parks or hiking from may 1st till november. Click ""herunterladen (PDF)"" to download a pdf with a map and images to see what to expect and maybe use google translate (google translate did not work on the homepage when I tried it, so i recommend the pdf ""workaround""). Here is a [map of the region with public transport lines](http://www.vgn.de/ib/site/documents/media/f387bb36-6624-65dd-c17b-5cde6c7b84f4.jpg/VG_Freizeit_Prospekt.jpg) that are interesting for tourists, green are regular routes, purple routes are weekend and holiday only and only in the summer while orange are weekend only during the whole year. If you need help to find the right trip, message me and I'll translate and help you to find the busses etc.

* [Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremberg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle (well, actually two castles) there and live there. 

* [Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [Morgenländischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.

* The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.

* At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or Ehrenbürg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.


**Traditional Food** you can expect in the region:
Aside from the famous [Nürnberger](http://www.nuernberger-bratwuerste.de/images/bilder/Gerichte_Feuer/46Bratwurst_20110812_437_kleiner_6%20mit%20Kraut.jpg), you should try [Fränkisches Schäuferla](http://www.frankenalb.de/uploads/pics/schaeufele_008_01.jpg) or [Saure Zipfel](http://www.antenne.de/cf/services/img/ccadd//470xx/4112797.jpg). [Spargel](http://www.spargel.net/images/spargel-mit-schinken.jpg) is also very common here. [Fränkischer Sauerbraten](http://autoimg.kochbar.de/kbrezept/45625_17700/400x266/rezept-sauerbraten-mit-lebkuchensosse-bild-nr-7.jpg) is a speciality, as there is gingerbread in the sauce. [Krenfleisch](http://www.genussregion.oberfranken.de/images_gen/spezialitaeten_bilder/716_big.jpg) has a sauce of horseradish. As side dishes, [Wirsing / Savoy cabbage](http://www.das-sonnenkorn.de/assets/images/wirsing.jpg), [Sauerkraut](http://www.marions-kochbuch.de/rezept/0283.jpg) or [Blaukraut](http://www.kostenlose-rezepte.eu/upload/Blaukraut-657.jpg) are the way to go next to the mandatory Kloß / Knödel which are either [Kartoffelklöße/knödel](http://bavariaundercover.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/kloss.jpg) (made of potatoes) or [Semmelkloß/knödel](http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/uploads/thumbnails/0009/00000000009/1024x1024/FeineSemmelknoedel_4f5e90da3a46fd18d55c0d07f683cbba_fjt2009040391.jpg)(made of bread rolls). As a dessert, you should try [Knieküchle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/K%C3%BCchla.JPG).

As drinks, try one of the [franconian white wines](http://www.bad-boys-on-tour.de/sommerhausen/bilder/bocksbeutel.jpg) in their characteristic bottles or one of the countless beers of the [region with the highest density of breweries in the world](http://www.franken-sind-keine-baiern.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Deutschland_Bier_Nebenkarte.jpg)

**Breweries I would recommend, although all are great:**

* Brauerei Wagner in Merkendorf
* Brauerei Goldener Löwe in Buttenheim (where the Levi Strauss museum is)
* Schlenkerla in Bamberg (The Rauchbier - that means Smoked beer- is a famous speciality, tastes like bacon) 
* Fässla in Bamberg
* Grasser in Huppendorf
* Klosterbrauerei in Weissenohe (founded 1050, one of the oldest breweries in germany, great food also!)

(Typical beer types in the region are ""helles"" and ""dunkles"", but also ""Märzen"" or ""Bockbier"") 

**Some Festivals in the Region:**

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.

* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.

* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)

* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.

* [Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!

* In the [Handwerkerhof](http://www.handwerkerhof.de/en/home.html) you can see how craftsmen create tradtitional products from the area in an medivial environment.

* Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 

* [Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp;amp;amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp;amp;amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.

* [Neues Museum Nürnberg](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neues_Museum_N%C3%BCrnberg) has a great collection of modern and contemporary art and design, for example Andy Warhol.

* [Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 

* [Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing

* In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!

* Nürnberg has a ~~soccer team and a~~ icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

* ADIDAS and PUMA have their headquarters and big outlet shopping centres in the small town of Herzogenaurach, 25km north-west of Nuremberg. If you want to go shopping for cheap sportswear (and more), you should consider a visit. Also if you are interested in [modern](http://www.vb.com/puma/puma-hq-herzogenaurach-m.jpg) [architecture](http://www.herzogenaurach.de/typo3temp/pics/e9cc906d7d.jpg).

**Bamberg:**

* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  

* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.

* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the [""Alte Hofhaltung""](http://www.emiksch.de/Lions/2007/Bilder/slides/Bamberg_Alte_Hofhaltung.jpg) where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)

* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""

* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above

* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.

* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.

* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;amp;z=18) as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.spezial-keller.de/index_files/stacks_image_44.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.

* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;amp;amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;amp;amp;num=30&amp;amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;amp;gl=de&amp;amp;amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;amp;amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;amp;amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;amp;radius=15000&amp;amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.

* Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

* Bamberg is a University Town with currently about 12k Students (at 70k people), so you'll find young people everywhere.

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor/founder of the famous [LEVI's Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recommend ""Schäuferla"" :)

**Würzburg:**

* [Würzburger Residenz](http://www.grand-i-tour.de/de/images/git_wuerzburgresi13.jpg) Also some scenes from the three musketeers were shot here

* [Feste Marienburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Festung-Marienberg_1409_10_11.jpg)
Würzburg is in the centre of [franconian wine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia_%28wine_region%29), which is known for its [Bocksbeutel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bocksbeutel.jpg)

* Würzburg has a Basketball team in the highest german league.

* The University of Würzburg has about 25k students enrolled, the city if full of them ;)

**Bayreuth:** 

* [The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)

* [The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see

* Bayreuth has a Basketball team in the highest german league. As you see, franconia is quite strong in german basketball with 3 teams.

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live (0,5 litre of beer: beginning at 1,50€), and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car, but there are is a list of [bus lines](http://vgn.de/freizeitlinien/) (german link) that are esp. for recreational/free time destinations like wildlife parks or hiking from may 1st till november. Click ""herunterladen (PDF)"" to download a pdf with a map and images to see what to expect and maybe use google translate (google translate did not work on the homepage when I tried it, so i recommend the pdf ""workaround""). Here is a [map of the region with public transport lines](http://www.vgn.de/ib/site/documents/media/f387bb36-6624-65dd-c17b-5cde6c7b84f4.jpg/VG_Freizeit_Prospekt.jpg) that are interesting for tourists, green are regular routes, purple routes are weekend and holiday only and only in the summer while orange are weekend only during the whole year. If you need help to find the right trip, message me and I'll translate and help you to find the busses etc.

* [Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremberg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle (well, actually two castles) there and live there. 

* [Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [Morgenländischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.

* The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.

* At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or Ehrenbürg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.


**Traditional Food** you can expect in the region:
Aside from the famous [Nürnberger](http://www.nuernberger-bratwuerste.de/images/bilder/Gerichte_Feuer/46Bratwurst_20110812_437_kleiner_6%20mit%20Kraut.jpg), you should try [Fränkisches Schäuferla](http://www.frankenalb.de/uploads/pics/schaeufele_008_01.jpg) or [Saure Zipfel](http://www.antenne.de/cf/services/img/ccadd//470xx/4112797.jpg). [Spargel](http://www.spargel.net/images/spargel-mit-schinken.jpg) is also very common here. [Fränkischer Sauerbraten](http://autoimg.kochbar.de/kbrezept/45625_17700/400x266/rezept-sauerbraten-mit-lebkuchensosse-bild-nr-7.jpg) is a speciality, as there is gingerbread in the sauce. [Krenfleisch](http://www.genussregion.oberfranken.de/images_gen/spezialitaeten_bilder/716_big.jpg) has a sauce of horseradish. As side dishes, [Wirsing / Savoy cabbage](http://www.das-sonnenkorn.de/assets/images/wirsing.jpg), [Sauerkraut](http://www.marions-kochbuch.de/rezept/0283.jpg) or [Blaukraut](http://www.kostenlose-rezepte.eu/upload/Blaukraut-657.jpg) are the way to go next to the mandatory Kloß / Knödel which are either [Kartoffelklöße/knödel](http://bavariaundercover.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/kloss.jpg) (made of potatoes) or [Semmelkloß/knödel](http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/uploads/thumbnails/0009/00000000009/1024x1024/FeineSemmelknoedel_4f5e90da3a46fd18d55c0d07f683cbba_fjt2009040391.jpg)(made of bread rolls). As a dessert, you should try [Knieküchle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/K%C3%BCchla.JPG).

As drinks, try one of the [franconian white wines](http://www.bad-boys-on-tour.de/sommerhausen/bilder/bocksbeutel.jpg) in their characteristic bottles or one of the countless beers of the [region with the highest density of breweries in the world](http://www.franken-sind-keine-baiern.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Deutschland_Bier_Nebenkarte.jpg)

**Breweries I would recommend, although all are great:**

* Brauerei Wagner in Merkendorf
* Brauerei Goldener Löwe in Buttenheim (where the Levi Strauss museum is)
* Schlenkerla in Bamberg (The Rauchbier - that means Smoked beer- is a famous speciality, tastes like bacon) 
* Fässla in Bamberg
* Grasser in Huppendorf
* Klosterbrauerei in Weissenohe (founded 1050, one of the oldest breweries in germany, great food also!)

(Typical beer types in the region are ""helles"" and ""dunkles"", but also ""Märzen"" or ""Bockbier"") 

**Some Festivals in the Region:**

* [Sandkirchweih Bamberg](http://www.sandkerwa.de/startseite/) 22.-26. August

But, expanding a bit on what diodi said, Poland will experience something  called [internal devaluation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_devaluation), which is what has happened in in the southern parts of the Eurozone. 

Basically, since the prices will rise, and Poland no longer can compete with Germany/Finland et al on being cheaper, you will no longer be competetive. Since this will hit you hard, you are not selling your products anymore which leads to unemployment etc, Poland will try to regain its competitiveness. That can either be done by building up an industry as effective as the Finns/Germans etc (I'll just for the sake of  argument use Germany in the future) or reducing costs. Building up an effective industry is ceratinly a possibility for the Poles, the only problem is that it takes decades, a generation, and massive investments. So, that is not really an  option for Poland, saying to people, ""hey, let us just wait 30 years, maybe then things will clear up"". So, Poland will, just like Portugal/Greece/Spain try to go for the second option, which is to reduce the costs. If the costs goes down, one can sell the products cheaper again, and thus beat Germany. So, how will you reduce the costs? The only way to really do it (it is not like raw material will be cheaper, that costs will be in Euro) is to press down labour costs. And you do that by firing people and lowering their salary. The wages will probably be cut for everyone, including government employees and also the firing will be across the board. This will of course lead to less consumtion, which is a problem. In short, you will to a lesser or greater degree experience what they are going through in Spain and Greece.

&gt; * The European Commission has ruled that by October next year, all new cars and vans sold across Europe must be fitted with the technology
&gt; * Some car manufacturers, including BMW and Volvo, already include eCall devices in their latest models
&gt; * Brussels insists eCall will save 2,500 lives a year by speeding up emergency services response times.

We also have public health care for people aged 65 and older (Medicare) and for the very poor (Medicaid), but Medicaid is very restrictive (e.g., in Texas they cut you off if you have any assets or have a job).

Who are we to hold a country up to our ideals? It's true we brought significant advancement in terms of technology. The problem is we also imposed our cultural ideals onto these nations.

The main example I can think of is the issue of gay relationships in Africa and Asia. Until we came along and started trying to impose Christian values (and I do mean imposed, we practically forced them to convert to our ways), gay relationships were not seen as a big deal (gay relationships were practically encouraged amongst Shinto monks on Japan, it was practically celebrated amongst native Americans, and there were reports of socially accepted homosexual relationships in at least the northern Congo and Lesotho (which by the way we found barbaric)). Japan incidentally ended up rejecting the idea that they should conform to western values, hence why homosexuality has only been banned for 8 years in Japan's history.

Tl;dr Yes, us bringing technology to these countries certainly helped. However to suggest they were savages before we ""civilised"" them is a horrifically imperialist view of the world.

Edit: also the suggestion we brought them human rights is laughable - as if we were the bastion of everything free and good in the 1800s..

For the EZ that means that Finland has to vote yes, Germany has to vote yes, etc. If the people says no, they should not be part of a fiscal union. With a fiscal union also comes permanent fiscal transfers and shared responsibilities, so the people in (for example) Finland have to agree to permanently transfer money to (for example) Portugal and not only do that, but to share their responsibilities. As in for example guarantee the Portuguese pensions and health care system. That means that the Finns permanently agrees to transfer their wealth to Portugal, which obviously means less wealth for the Finns. As you can understand that also means a far more integrated political system and effectively an end to national states, or at least a curbing of them. So, it will be a United States of Europe with permanent wealth transfers and mutual guarantees that for example the social system will work. That means common taxation etc. And one government. 

Do you see the Finns voting yes to what in all practically would be an end to them as a sovereign nation? Do you seem them lowering their living standard and sending half of their GDP to Brussels to make sure that t is distributed among the south? 

To create a federation there has to be democratic enthusiasm for it. And, either there has to be a shared history and willingness to sacrifice (let's say DDR/BRD, when West Germany willingly picked up the bill) or the countries have to be on equal footing so that integration can take place slowly and no one feel like they are being used, or involve to huge sacrifices/transfers. I imagine that could happen between the Nordic countries if they choose to join in a union. Or perhaps between BeNeLux? 

None of that is present in today's Eurozone. Can you imagine the Finns (I am just using them as an example, but take the Germans/Dutch/Belgians) voting to essentially transfers huge amounts  of their wealth (and we are talking enormous amounts, huge percentages of their GDP), permanently signing up to pay for the south while transferring the power to Brussels? All why taking cuts themselves, enormous cuts and while still paying higher taxes? How would you go about getting that vote through? I imagine you think it should be democratic, like me, and then you have to agree, people would vote no.

It was exactly the other way around. The BND warned the CIA several times that ""Curveball"" was not trustworthy but the CIA ignored it.  
I remember an interview with Joschka Fischer where he implied that the CIA ""wanted"" to believe Curveball.


http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/03/iraq.usa1
&gt; By early 2001, the Germans were having doubts of their own, telling the CIA their spy was 'out of control'. But warnings were dismissed. Intelligence analysts who voiced concern were 'forced to leave' the unit mainly responsible for analysing his claims, the commission found. At every turn analysts were blocked by spy chiefs and their warning never passed on to policy-makers.  

http://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article13569264/USA-haben-BND-fuer-Irak-Krieg-missbraucht.html

true,shamefullout,null,null,"Ich möchte über den Begriff „Orte und Formen der Macht“ sprechen. Die Macht ist die Möglichkeit oder Fähigkeit, dass jemand etwas bewirken oder beeinflussen kann. Im Unterricht haben wir Deutschland nach *dem Zweiten Weltkrieg behandelt* . Nach *dem Krieg war Deutschland geteilt, es gab die BRD im Westen und die DDR im Osten*. Deshalb können wir fragen (besser: meine Frage ist: ), welche *Formen der Macht existierten in der* DDR. Ich werde zwei Dokumente *untersuchen*. Das erste Dokument ist eine Szene *aus dem* Film „Das Leben der anderen“. Das zweite ist ein Reportage über den Tag *des* Mauerfall*s*.

„Das Leben der *A*nderen“ ist ein Film über die Überwachung in *der* DDR. Tatsächlich *war das* Regime in *der* DDR autoritär. *Im Gegensatz zur BRD haben die DDR-Bürger nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg keine Meinungsfreiheit bekommen.* Die DDR war ein Teil des Ostblock*s*. Folglich *mussten die* Leute einverstanden *sein* mit *dem* Kommunismus. Die Szene *aus dem Film/des Films* veranschaulicht diese*n* Aspekt. *Sie* zeigt ein Mann, Wiesler, der für die Stasi arbeitet, und der *in die Wohnung einer Schauspielerin einbricht*, um sie auszuspionieren. Er installiert Wanzen, weil er die Gespräche der Schauspielerin abhören will. Somit hofft er Beweise zu finden, weil er vermutet, dass sie eine Republikfeindin ist. Zudem er bleibt immerfort (weird choice of word, *die ganze Zeit über* is better) emotionlos, sachlich, und tüchtig. Es zeigt, dass das Regime sehr streng ist, und ~~wird~~ riesig*e* Ressourcen verwende*t*, um *seine* Feinde zu zerstören. Nicht nur können die DDR-Bürger nicht ihre Meinung sprechen, sonder *das Regime steuert auch die Medien*. Es ist sichtbar in *der* Szene, weil Wiesler *eine Zeitung, den Spiegel, findet*. *Sie ist* versteckt in *der* Wohnung, *obwohl* es in *der* DDR verboten ist. Außerdem herrscht das Regime *nicht nur* durch streng*e* Überwachung, sondern auch durch Angst. In *der* Szene bedroht Wiesler die Nachbarin und sagt, dass wenn sie die Schauspielerin erzählt, ihre Tochter will nicht ihre Studium fortsetzen. Somit hat die DDR eine drücke Macht für die Bevölkerung. (Last two sentences are unclear)

Diese Reportage erzählt *vom* Mauerfall in Berlin und Lübeck. *Die* Berliner Mauer *ist* am 9. November 1989 gefallen. An diesem Tag waren die West-Deutschen und die Ost-Deutschen endlich wieder vereint. Jedoch *sind*, während die Zeit *sie getrennt hat* ~~vergeht~~, viele Unterschiede *entstanden*. Tatsächlich *haben sie* für 20 Jahre *in* entgegengesetzt*en* Regimes *gelebt*. Die streng*en* Maßnahmen der DDR *haben den* Osten verspätet gemacht. Das ist sichtbar in der Reportage mit *den* Trabbis und *den Wartburgs*, die *die* typischen Autos der DDR-Bürger sind und die ~~in der Westen Straßen sind an den Mauerfall Tag~~ *am Tag des Mauerfalls in den Straßen des Westens auftauchen*. *Außerdem sind an diesem Tag* viele DDR-Bürger ~~sind~~ in die BRD gegangen. Die Bilder von der Reportage sind auffallend, weil die große DDR-Bürger Menge zeigt, dass sie ~~waren~~ von der Welt getrennt *waren*, und ~~wollen~~ jetzt ein Teil davon sein *wollen*. Alle ~~die~~ DDR-Bürger in der Reportage sind glücklich, sogar euphorisch. Es zeigt, dass *das* DDR Regime ~~war nicht geschätzt von die Bevölkerung~~ *von der Bevölkerung nicht geschätzt wurde*. In *dem* Video, ~~die DDR-Bürger besuchen Supermärkte~~ *gehen die DDR-Bürger in Supermärkte*, und kaufen Dinge, die ~~nicht in die DDR vorliegen~~ *die es in der DDR nicht gibt*. Sie kennen nicht alle die Produkte im Supermarkt, weil *das* Regime ~~hatte~~ die Kontrolle *hatte* über alle ~~die~~ Produkte im Osten. *S*ie wollten nicht Produkte *vom* Westen kaufen. ~~Somit, die Bevölkerung hat 20 Jahre lang von die Welt getrennt sein, weil die Regime wollte nicht kompromittiert von der Westen werden.~~ *So war die Bevölkerung 20 Jahre lang von der Welt getrennt, weil das Regime nicht vom Westen kompromittiert werden wollte.*

Zum Schluss, *hat die DDR* eine sehr hart*e Form der Macht* ~~benutzen~~ *benutzt*. Sie *verwendete* Überwachung und Angst um die Bevölkerung zu kontrollieren. Sie hat versucht ~~zu die DDR-Bürger über der Westen gelogen~~ *die DDR_Bürger über den Westen zu belügen*, weil sie ~~hatte~~ Angst *hatte* vor Aufstände. Schließlich ~~diese Macht hat~~ *hat diese (Form der) Macht* nicht funktioniert und die DDR *ist* gescheitert.

Putins propaganda actually follows a lot of the same strategies as the right wing and corporate interests do in America when they're trying to muddy up a debate. I feel this ""fascism"" thing as well as the whole of RT's/State Media coverage of both Ukraine and Syria could fit into a lot of these boxes. 

________________________________________________________________

Tactic #1: Take the Offensive.
""Throws opponents “off message,” so they cannot get their message across. In addition, a candidate who is on the defensive generally makes a poor impression on voters, who are looking for positive and assertive leadership.""


Tactic #2: Attack Your Opponent’s Strengths.
""Rove’s tactic of attacking an opponent’s strengths forces his opponent to back away from the very qualities that makes them an attractive candidate.""


Tactic #3: Accuse Your Opponent of What He/She is Going to Accuse You Of.
""‘You say that I don’t love you! I think it is you who does not love me!’""


Tactic #4: Go Negative, Then Cry Foul.
""campaign typically “goes negative” early, using scare tactics or lifting comments out of context. Once the opponent retaliates, the Rove camp calls public attention to their “dirty” campaign tactics.""


Tactic #5: The “Big Lie”.
""Ironically, it is the very magnitude of a “big lie” that makes it believable. The response of the voters can be summarized as follows: “Well, there must be some truth in the assertion, or they wouldn’t be able to say it. Where there’ smoke, there’s fire.”""


Tactic #6: Appeal to Moral Values.
""At campaign events, Bush openly discussed his “faith-based” approach to government, declaring that his religious beliefs were at the core of his political decisions.""

""Twenty-two percent of voters polled said that the issue of moral issues mattered most in deciding how to vote for president. Of those 22 percent, 80 percent voted for President Bush.""


Tactic #7: Sell the (Bush) Persona.
* Bush, the Man of the people
* Bush the Macho Man:
    ""Never Apologize, Stay the Course.""


* Bush the Dimwit.
    ""people often tend to “misunderestimate” him, thus, taking him lightly""
    ""As a result, the Bush team was able to claim a victory in the debate for even
    coming close to the challenger’s performance.""

    ""this dimwit persona is used to absolve Bush of responsibility when things
    go wrong.""


Tactic #8: Sell an Adolescent Worldview.
""The Rove campaign machine sells an adolescent worldview that resonates
  with the American public""

* An uncomplicated world
* A world of immediate gratification
* A self-absorbed world


Tactic #9: Exploit the Media.
* Exploiting the capabilities of the media.  
    ""They understand the visual as well as anybody ever has.""

* Denouncing the Media.
    ""One of the most damaging Big Lies perpetuated by conservatives is that the
    American media are liberal. In reality, right wing ideological media has emerged as a
    powerful presence in the U.S. However, this charge provides a way to discredit
    unfavorable news reports.""

* Controlling the mainstream media through intimidation.
    ""Early in Bush’s first term, the White House abolished the longstanding tradition of
    allowing reporter Helen Thomas to ask the first question at press conferences.
    This was a strong signal to the press corps that critics of the administration would
    be penalized.""

* Imposing limits on “unscripted encounters” with the media.
    ""... Instead, the administration requires that journalists submit their questions in
    advance and using assigned seating to pinpoint friendly questioners.""

* Cultivating a network of influential media commentators and media outlets that
supports the (Bush) agenda
    ""Rush Limbaugh ... Fox news ... a survey found that regular viewers of Fox news
    were more likely to hold certain misconceptions, as compared to consumers of
    other mainstream media channels""

* Exploiting the capabilities of the media.
    ""television ads are most effective when they focus on themes rather than issues""

    ""the “MTV style,” relying on hand-held cameras and quick cuts, sends a message
    that the candidate is dynamic, innovative and energetic.""

* Popular culture can serve as a valuable resource for campaign strategy.
    ""political commercials are so predictable that the audience tunes them out.
    However, an ad campaign could be designed with an eye on popular media
    programming""

* Cultivate ideological media.
* Political campaigns must take advantage of the vast potential of the Internet.



Tactic #10: Create Straw Issues.
""The Bush campaigns manufacture minor (but emotionally loaded) issues in order to divert the attention and allegiance of voters.""

""Because most people think superficially, few will notice that the point is minor, especially if they are emotionally attached to it.""

""Rove raised wedge issues, including same sex marriage, gun control, and abortion""


Tactic #11: Employ Surrogates.
 ""“The advantage of speaking through a surrogate was that we could say sulfurous
things about our opponent and put that on record without our candidate taking
personal responsibility for it.”""


Tactic #12: Use Emotional Appeals.
""The (Bush) campaign strategy taps into a wide range of fears and insecurities that
in turn controls their attitudes and—more importantly—their voting behavior. As
Jim McDermott observes, creating a climate of fear makes people compliant—willing
to accept the unacceptable and embrace a strong, authoritarian leader.""


Tactic #13: Rely on Expert Testimonials.
""It is not terribly difficult to find “experts” who will support a political point of view.
Often, these people have a financial stake in their positions (e.g., working for a
tobacco company or as a lobbyist) or hold a like-minded ideological position""


Tactic #14: Rhetorical Devices.
* Misrepresenting a person's position and presenting it in a form that people will reject.
* Take your opponent’s words out of context.
* Three-Card Monte.
* Shift the burden of proof.
* Shift the argument.
* Personal Testimonials.
* Ignore/Downplay the Evidence.
* Substitute (isolated) Fact for Truth.
* Evasive Rhetorical Techniques.


Tactic 15: Use of Language.
* Newspeak, Connotative words, Labels, Euphemisms, Obfuscation, Code Words.",1,1399889024,null,0,false,0,chfu5s1,t3_25chpt,t1_chfu5s1,t3_25chpt,null,1433759483,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

true,vertumne,EURO,Slovenia,"How the euro was saved - In the first part of a series on the year that forever changed Europe, Peter Spiegel recreates the three bitter days in November when the eurozone crisis hit its lowest moment.

&gt; To the astonishment of almost everyone in the room, Angela Merkel began to cry.  
&gt; “Das ist nicht fair.” That is not fair, the German chancellor said angrily, tears welling in her eyes. “Ich bringe mich nicht selbst um.” I am not going to commit suicide.  
&gt; For those who witnessed the breakdown in a small conference room in the French seaside resort of Cannes, it was shocking enough to watch Europe’s most powerful and emotionally controlled leader brought to tears.  
&gt; But the scene was even more remarkable, those present said, for the two objects of her ire: the man sitting next to her, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and the other across the table, US President Barack Obama.  
&gt; It would be the low point in a brutal, recrimination-filled night, one many participants would recall as the nadir of the three-year eurozone crisis. Mr Sarkozy had hoped his leadership of the Group of 20 summit would cement his standing on the global stage en route to re-election. Instead, everything was falling apart.  
&gt; Greece was imploding politically; Italy, a country too big to bail out, appeared just days away from being cut off from global financial markets; and Ms Merkel, try as Mr Sarkozy and Mr Obama might, could not be convinced to increase German contributions to the eurozone’s “firewall” – the “big bazooka” or “wall of money” they believed had to grow dramatically to fend off attacks by panicking bond traders.
&gt; Instead, a cornered Ms Merkel threw the French and American criticism back in their faces. If Mr Sarkozy or Mr Obama did not like the way her government ran, they had only themselves to blame. After all, it was their allied militaries that had “imposed” the German constitution on a defeated wartime foe six decades earlier.  
&gt; “It was the point where clearly the eurozone as we know it could have exploded,” said a member of the French delegation at Cannes. “It was the feeling [that with] the contagion, at this point, you were on the brink of explosion.”  
&gt; And yet less than a year after that November 2011 night, the existential crisis for Europe’s single currency would, for all intents and purposes, be over. The markets that once threatened to tear the euro apart would be tamed and the seemingly endless series of all-night emergency summits would come to an end.  
&gt; When the history of the eurozone crisis is written, the period from late 2011 through 2012 will be remembered as the months that forever changed the European project. Strict budget rules were made inviolable; banking oversight was stripped from national authorities; and the printing presses of the European Central Bank would become the lender of last resort for failing eurozone sovereigns.  
&gt; Next week, European voters will go to the polls to render a verdict on what EU leaders created over those 12 months. If opinion polling is any indication, their judgment will be harsh: anti-EU parties are poised for unprecedented gains from France to Finland, Athens to Amsterdam.  
&gt; Over the course of the past six months, the Financial Times has interviewed dozens of participants in those decisions to tell the full story of how this new eurozone was created. From mid-level bureaucrats to prime ministers, they tell an unsettling tale of accidents, near misses and seemingly foolhardy brinkmanship. But in the end, these same leaders appear to have prevailed. The euro has been saved. The Europe they have created, for good or for ill, will be their legacy.  
&gt; ‘I hope he’s told Merkel’   
&gt; As with nearly everything in the eurozone crisis, it started in Greece.  
&gt; George Papandreou, the lanky scion of Greece’s most famous political dynasty, had returned to Athens from one of the most consequential EU crisis summits to find his country in upheaval. On October 27 in Brussels, he had agreed to the largest sovereign default in history – a €200bn debt restructuring that cut what Athens owed private bondholders in half. But at home, he was being vilified.  
&gt; ‘I realised the situation was getting out of control.’  
&gt; - George Papandreou  
&gt; For the son and grandson of Greek prime ministers arrested on the same night by a military junta in 1967 – Mr Papandreou can still recall arming himself aged 14 with a double-barrelled shotgun when authorities arrived at his childhood home – what happened the day after his return from Brussels was particularly unnerving.  
&gt; During a military procession in Thessaloniki to mark the anniversary of Greece’s entry into the second world war, thousands of anti-austerity protesters, including rightwing radicals and anarchists, stormed the parade route, forcing Karolos Papoulias, Greece’s president, to flee. Mr Papandreou would later tell his fellow prime ministers he felt the incident was a sign his country was on the verge of another coup.  
&gt; “Everybody was saying that the government are traitors,” Mr Papandreou recalled. “I realised the situation was getting out of control.”  
&gt; That weekend, he gathered a small group of advisers and unveiled his plan: he would call a national referendum on the new €172bn bailout programme. Those criticising the agreement, including opposition leader Antonis Samaras and rebels within his own party, would be forced to pick sides, Mr Papandreou reasoned, and most would back the rescue – particularly since without EU bailout funds, disorderly default and euro exit was the likely outcome. Victory would give him the mandate for the reforms that bailout lenders were demanding.  
&gt; But Mr Papandreou did not consult outside his tightly knit inner circle. Instead, he presented his plan as a fait accompli to parliamentarians from his centre-left Pasok party the following evening. Those in the room were in shock, including Evangelos Venizelos, Mr Papandreou’s finance minister. “On Sunday evening, during our last meeting in person, in private, Papandreou [spoke] only on a proposal of [a vote of] confidence, not at all about the referendum,” Mr Venizelos said, adding that he suffered acute abdominal pains in the following hours, forcing him to go to hospital. “This was the result, the medical result, of the stress.”  
&gt; Others had a different, non-medical worry. “I remember the first thing that went through my mind: ‘I hope he’s told Merkel,’” said one minister.   
&gt; Mr Papandreou later claimed he had tipped off fellow EU leaders. Some acknowledge vague recollections but others remember nothing. “I never took it seriously,” said a fellow leader. “It sounded a little bit desperate.”  
&gt; So when Mr Sarkozy learnt that Mr Papandreou had decided to put their carefully crafted bailout deal up for a vote, he exploded. “He was ballistic,” said an aide. “He was ballistic.”  
&gt; Eurozone bond markets, which had briefly rallied after the Greek debt restructuring was agreed, sold off in a panic. Yields on Greece’s benchmark 10-year bond spiked by 16.2 per cent in a single day. More worryingly, borrowing costs for bigger eurozone governments began to approach levels where others had been forced into bailouts: yields on Italy’s 10-year bond jumped to more than 6.2 per cent.  
&gt; 
&gt; She was torn over Grexit   
&gt; Mr Sarkozy summoned his closest advisers for an emergency meeting at the Elysée Palace. According to a person in the room, the French president’s initial reaction was to force Mr Papandreou to reverse course: that either he accept the new bailout conditions immediately or Greece would be forced out of the euro.  
&gt; But Henri Guaino, a Sarkozy confidant and speech writer, noted Charles de Gaulle himself preferred referendums to parliamentary politics. Asking Mr Papandreou to cancel a plebiscite would go against their Gaullist traditions, he argued. So Mr Sarkozy came up with a compromise: Mr Papandreou could go ahead with a referendum – but not on the bailout.  
&gt; Mr Sarkozy called Ms Merkel and agreed a strategy. They would summon Mr Papandreou to Cannes, where the G20 was to get under way in just 48 hours, and persuade him to hold a referendum on whether Greece would remain in the eurozone.  
&gt; ‘For Merkel, a key issue was whether the Greeks themselves wanted to be in or out’  
&gt; - German official  
&gt; In Berlin, Ms Merkel was torn over the issue of “Grexit”, with several advisers – particularly Wolfgang Schäuble, her powerful finance minister – arguing that it would bind the 16 remaining eurozone members more closely, allowing them to pull themselves out of the crisis.  
&gt; “She was very keen on it being a clear ‘in or out’ question,” said a German official. “For her . . . a key issue was whether the Greeks themselves wanted to be in or out, and if there would have been a referendum and the Greeks would have decided that they want out, that would have made the path easier.”  
&gt; Many EU officials still wonder why Mr Papandreou agreed to show up in Cannes to be hauled over the carpet. While he was stunned by the outpouring of anger from EU leaders that Tuesday morning, the Greek prime minister said he relished the chance to win international support for his referendum idea on a global stage.  
&gt; Although famous for hosting the glamorous Cannes Film Festival, the Palais des Festivals is a charmless hulk of stone and glass jutting into the Mediterranean. In an effort to give the Palais’ long, beige halls some panache for the G20 summit, French organisers decorated them with fluorescent green bunting and carpets. But a chilly drizzle cast a pall over the meetings. Soon the carpets began turning a muddy brown.

true,vertumne,EURO,Slovenia,"&gt; Mr Sarkozy summoned his fellow leaders to the Palais at 5.30pm on Wednesday, an hour before they were due to meet Mr Papandreou, to agree on how to confront him. Those invited included Ms Merkel; Jean-Claude Juncker, the Luxembourg prime minister who chaired the eurogroup of finance ministers; Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund; and the EU’s two presidents, José Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy.  
&gt; When the group assembled in a small, bland conference room, seated on rococo Louis XV chairs around a long table, Mr Sarkozy passed around a single sheet, titled “Position commune sur la Grèce” – common position on Greece. “The idea was to put Papandreou against the wall, in the corner,” said one person in the room.  
&gt; ‘Italy has no credibility’   
&gt; Mr Sarkozy’s six-point plan, obtained by the FT, was clear and tough: Mr Papandreou must accept the bailout plan agreed the week before, and no further aid would be forthcoming until his parliament voted its assent.  
&gt; “We are always ready to help Greece, despite the unilateral decision to announce [the referendum] without any prior notification,” point two read, a clear reflection of Mr Sarkozy’s anger. Point six was clearest of all: “The referendum shall be only on the membership of Greece in the euro area and the European Union.”  
&gt; Mr Papandreou would later claim it was primarily Mr Sarkozy who fought with him to change the referendum’s wording to “in or out” of the euro, and that Ms Merkel was on his side. But those in the room said there was little dissent from any of the leaders, including the German chancellor.  
&gt; ‘The idea was to put Papandreou against the wall, in the corner.’  
&gt; With the Greek lines agreed, Mr Sarkozy turned to the subject weighing more heavily on their minds: Italy. Mr Papandreou’s referendum had created a dilemma for Greece but it also gave rise to a much greater fear that contagion from Athens would spread across the eurozone. No country posed more of a contagion danger than Italy.  
&gt; With nearly €2tn in sovereign debt – the fourth-largest debt pile in the world – Italian finance ministry officials estimated a three-year bailout programme would cost about €600bn. There was not enough money in the EU or IMF to foot that bill. Italy was simply too big to bail.  
&gt; “We could not afford Italy,” said a French finance ministry official. “No one could afford Italy, so that was the end probably of the eurozone.”  
&gt; Ms Lagarde arrived in Cannes with a plan to put Italy into an €80bn “precautionary programme”, a line of credit that could be used in emergency but would also come with intensive monitoring to ensure Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister who had lost the confidence of his EU peers, would implement economic reforms. Only then, she argued, would markets begin lending again at sustainable rates. “Italy has no credibility,” Ms Lagarde told the group.  
&gt; But any Italian decision would have to wait. Mr Papandreou was about to arrive.  
&gt; ‘The full Sarkozy’   
&gt; The meeting would leave many participants shell-shocked. In his journal, François Baroin, Mr Sarkozy’s finance minister, would call it “psychological warfare”. Others, particularly the EU’s two presidents, would later tell associates they were extremely uncomfortable with a small group of European leaders forcing the hand of the elected prime minister of a sovereign country. “For me, I have never seen a meeting so tense and so difficult,” said another aide.  
&gt; Once Mr Papandreou and Mr Venizelos arrived in the conference room, Mr Sarkozy began what one official called “the full Sarkozy”: a pointed, angry denunciation of Mr Papandreou’s referendum decision.  
&gt; “Clearly the feeling was: We’ve done everything to help you, we’ve done everything to keep you in the eurozone, we’ve taken financial, political risk,” said a member of France’s delegation. “It’s the biggest debt restructuring in the world, ever, and now what you do is you betray us.”  
&gt; ‘The position of Sarkozy was very offensive. It was not polite. Very, very strong and very offensive’  
&gt; - Evangelos Venizelos  
&gt; Mr Papandreou was taken aback. “He goes there and he starts ranting and raving on the referendum,” he said of Mr Sarkozy. Added Mr Venizelos: “The position of Sarkozy was very offensive. It was not polite. Very, very strong and very offensive, in order to put Greece in a dilemma: in or out.”  
&gt; The Greeks attempted to fight back. Mr Papandreou laid out his plan: the referendum would be in a month’s time, and it would force Mr Samaras and his own Pasok rebels to fall into line, since even his most virulent mainstream critics could not oppose the country’s only lifeline to staying in the eurozone. Then Mr Papandreou read his proposed wording for the referendum. “I had a slightly long paragraph,” Mr Papandreou conceded.  
&gt; Ms Merkel was the first to respond, and she was not happy. “We either solve this among ourselves here, or we will fail in the eyes of the world,” she said. “Wir müssen entscheiden” – we must decide. “Either you want to stay in the euro or go out.”  
&gt; Those in the room said Mr Papandreou visibly deflated as the fight continued. As he fatigued, Mr Venizelos took up the battle, a sign many saw as the sudden realisation by the Greek prime minister that he had become a spent political force – and Mr Venizelos, who had long coveted the premiership, was moving to exploit the change in circumstances.  
&gt; Straight talking: France's Nicolas Sarkozy tore into Greek prime minister George Papandreou's plan to hold a referundum  
&gt; It was a shift in body language that caught the attention of Mr Barroso, who had sat quietly through most of the fireworks. The European Commission president would later tell associates that the scene playing out in front of him was making him increasingly alarmed. On top of the loose talk of a Greek euro exit, which commission officials long believed would trigger uncontrollable market panic throughout southern Europe, the prospect of a month-long referendum campaign would have sown weeks of uncertainty – exactly what they were trying to avoid as Italian bond yields were rising to dangerous levels.  
&gt; Unbeknown to Mr Sarkozy or Ms Merkel, Mr Barroso had called Mr Samaras, the Greek opposition leader, from his hotel before the meeting. He knew Mr Samaras was desperate to avoid the referendum.  
&gt; Mr Samaras told Mr Barroso he was now willing to sign on to a national unity government between his New Democracy party and Pasok – something he had assiduously avoided for months in the hopes he could secure the premiership on his own.  
&gt; ‘We have to kill this referendum’  
&gt; - José Manuel Barroso  
&gt; Mr Barroso summoned his cabinet and other commission staff to his suite at the art deco Hotel Majestic Barrière to plot strategy. He decided he would not tell Mr Sarkozy or Ms Merkel of the conversation but according to people in the room, they began discussing names of possible technocrats to take over from Mr Papandreou in a national unity government. The first person to come to Mr Barroso’s lips was Lucas Papademos, the Greek economist who had left his post as vice-president of the ECB a year earlier. Within a week, Mr Papademos would have the job.  
&gt; Watching Mr Venizelos assert himself hours later inside the Palais, Mr Barroso saw his opportunity. Mr Sarkozy brought the meeting to a close, rereading his six-point plan and telling Mr Papandreou to go back to Athens to “take a decision”, and Mr Barroso pulled Mr Venizelos aside.  
&gt; “We have to kill this referendum,” Mr Barroso said. The finance minister agreed almost immediately. Killing the referendum idea would also be the end of Mr Papandreou.  
&gt; After brief remarks to the press in which he said the referendum would be “a question of whether we want to remain in the eurozone”, Mr Papandreou headed back to Nice airport. In the car, he turned to Mr Venizelos and said that things had not gone as badly as he had feared. Mr Venizelos was incredulous. As Mr Papandreou slept on the flight home, Mr Venizelos, emboldened by Mr Barroso’s admonition, ordered an aide to write up a statement to be released when they landed, at 4.45am on Thursday. “Greece’s position within the euro area is a historic conquest of the country that cannot be put in doubt,” the statement read. “This acquis by the Greek people cannot depend on a referendum.”  
&gt; Mr Papandreou’s referendum was dead. As was his premiership.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt; That is true, what languages do you think are better candidates?

Not any official ones. Minority languages isolated within countries with speakers that also speak other languages with a big community are the most likely candidates. Icelandic is very isolated though, they have a quite exclusive territory, a lot of writers in the language relatively and they insist on creating new Icelandic words for new phenomena, so they're safe.

&gt;I think cultural, economic and geographical factors are more important than the amount of speakers.

The ones that are going to disappear next will inevitably be the ones with the fewest speakers, naturally :)

&gt; Netherlands and Belgium just happens to be very focused on international trade, have a large English speaking cultural influence, and not be particularly nationalistic. Which means you share a lot of the factors that make the Scandinavian countries good candidates for gradually changing into speaking English.

A Lingua Franca doesn't just take over territories out of nowhere, you don't need to worry about that. Even if they do a massive vocabulary dump in the local language, the structure still remains the same: English still is a Germanic language, for example.

As for Dutch, there is no threat for Dutch to be *replaced* by English any time soon. One doesn't just gradually change into another language. The only potential threat for Dutch would be an expansion of Brussels, but that's a very hot political topic and it's actually possible to motivate voters who are concerned to stop it. It might just as well work the other way, an expansion of Brussels might turn Brussels more Dutch rather than French.

true,vertumne,EURO,Slovenia,"&gt; ‘A sign of weakness’   
&gt; For months the Obama administration had been watching the eurozone crisis with frustration and mounting concern. Tim Geithner, the US Treasury secretary, and his team in Washington had tried to impart lessons learnt during their banking crisis – namely that only a huge wall of public money would calm panicked investors. Despite repeated high-profile European tours by Mr Geithner, and more discreet visits by his deputies, the Americans felt eurozone leaders still fell short.  
&gt; In some quarters, the White House was suspected of playing politics. “The Americans had only one objective, which is fully understandable,” said one European who dealt directly with Mr Geithner. “The eurozone has to be saved because otherwise we’ll enter into a depression in Europe, and this will impact the economy of the US and my re-election.” US denials were not entirely believed in Europe.  
&gt; The awkwardness was epitomised by Washington’s relationship with Ms Merkel, who occasionally found US intervention improper and unwelcome. Berlin had pushed for the Washington-based IMF to be part of the crisis response. But on occasions when Mr Obama weighed in, Ms Merkel would tell colleagues that European decisions should be made by Europeans.  
&gt; Although the two leaders appear similarly cerebral and unemotional, people close to Ms Merkel say their styles are fundamentally different. Mr Obama can be professorial and lecturing, something Ms Merkel finds off-putting. Ms Merkel shuns such academic musings and is more short-term and tactical in her decision-making.  
&gt; Still, many in Brussels, Frankfurt and Paris welcomed American intervention, particularly as a counterweight to Berlin. US officials say they were frequently dragged into crisis disputes by competing national capitals and urged to press the Germans to move more decisively. On other occasions, they say, the German government called on Washington to push struggling eurozone countries to implement promised reforms.  
&gt; Regardless of whether European leaders welcomed US intervention, they felt Mr Obama was on top of the eurozone portfolio, something they found remarkable for a leader with so much on his plate.  
&gt; [Obama taking charge] was a signal that Europe was not able to do it. It was a sign of weakness.’  
&gt; - German delegate  
&gt; Yet when eurozone leaders were summoned again by Mr Sarkozy at 9.30pm that night in Cannes, several were surprised to find Mr Obama chairing the meeting. “It was strange,” said a member of the German delegation. “It was also a signal that Europe was not able to do that; it was a sign of weakness.”  
&gt; Many in the room expected the evening to be dedicated to persuading Mr Berlusconi to accept IMF assistance. The Italians had rejected it that morning, arguing it would create the impression they could not handle the crisis on their own, while providing insufficient resources to deal with the fallout. They countered with an offer to accept IMF monitoring, but not funds.   
&gt; But Mr Obama opened the session with something different. He had a new plan to increase the size of the eurozone firewall – an idea that put Germany front and centre.  
&gt; The decision by Mr Sarkozy to cede the chair to Mr Obama, consciously or not, should not have come as a surprise. Since the outset of the crisis, Paris and Washington had almost identical recipes for solving it: a firewall of such size that no bond trader would question whether the eurozone had sufficient funds or political will to rescue the heavily indebted south.  
&gt; To both Mr Geithner and his French counterparts, the most obvious source for that firewall was the ECB, which literally has the power to print money. The US had demonstrated the crisis-fighting power of a central bank when the Federal Reserve bought up huge tracts of Treasuries in the wake of Lehman Brothers’ collapse. But Berlin has long opposed using a central bank to fund governments.  
&gt; It was a matter of principle   
&gt; German opposition was rooted in its dark history: the hyperinflation of the interwar years that helped doom the Weimar Republic had been caused, in part, by central bank printing presses, which churned out marks to pay war reparations. At German insistence, the ECB had been modelled after the Bundesbank, which was given complete independence from meddling politicians when it was established in the 1950s, to avoid a repeat of the 1920s . The German government also demanded that the EU’s 1992 Maastricht treaty, which laid the foundations for the euro’s creation, bar the ECB from buying sovereign bonds.  
&gt; Both Mr Geithner and Mr Sarkozy had spent months trying to solve two seemingly mutually exclusive problems: increasing the firewall enough to convince bond traders there was sufficient eurozone money to prevent a Greek default from being repeated elsewhere, while not falling foul of German objections.  
&gt; On the eve of Cannes, US and French delegations agreed a new plan to increase crisis-fighting reserves they hoped would be acceptable in Berlin. It involved a form of cash known by few beyond the cognoscenti of international public finance: special drawing rights, or SDRs.  
&gt; Technically, SDRs are not money. They are an asset created by international agreement in 1969 and held by the IMF for its member countries, a substitute for gold or US dollars in global financial accounting. Sometimes referred to as “paper gold”, they cannot be held by anyone other than the IMF and must be converted into another currency before they can be spent. And yet they have real value, with one SDR currently trading close to the value of one British pound.  
&gt; In 2009, in the wake of the Lehman crisis, G20 leaders increased the amount of SDRs in existence by $250bn, essentially creating new IMF firefighting reserves out of thin air. At Cannes, the US and France wanted to do it again but instead of giving them to the IMF, the eurozone would devote €140bn in SDRs to its depleted bailout fund.  
&gt; Our preference is that the ECB act a bit like the Federal Reserve did, but that doesn’t seem to be a viable option’  
&gt; - Barack Obama  
&gt; Even those involved in drawing up the plan admit it was hastily thrown together. Back in that Obama-chaired meeting, the group found themselves enmeshed in German politics. “Our preference in the US is that the ECB should act a bit like the Federal Reserve did but that doesn’t seem to be a viable option,” Mr Obama said at the start, in a clear reference to German opposition.  
&gt; But Ms Merkel now had another problem. Officials said she was open to Mr Obama’s idea. But SDRs are not controlled by national governments; they are controlled by central banks. And Jens Weidmann, the head of the Bundesbank, was opposed.  
&gt; The Bundesbank, which is responsible for representing Germany at the IMF, had picked up word of the scheme through sources at the fund in Washington. Mr Weidmann had quickly drafted a letter to the German government outlining his objections. Mr Weidmann’s reasoning was both practical and ideological. Practically, the German central banker felt the plan smacked of desperation. Using foreign reserves to fill the bailout fund would send markets the wrong message: only through financial jerry-rigging could funding be found.  
&gt; But more importantly to Mr Weidmann was the principle: SDRs are, like a country’s gold holdings, part of a government’s foreign reserves, which are the exclusive responsibility of the independent central bank to manage – not for politicians to commit willy-nilly to rescue programmes. The Bundesbank had no problem with the 2009 decision to increase SDRs for the IMF, since that is what SDRs were for. But committing them to the eurozone’s bailout fund set a dangerous precedent.  
&gt; Mr Weidmann’s letter urged Ms Merkel to bury the proposal. But according to German officials, their delegation did not get the letter before leaving for Cannes. Instead, they only learnt of Mr Weidmann’s objection over the phone after they arrived in France, and then in a series of calls attempted to convince him to change his mind. It had become clear to Ms Merkel’s camp that they were about to be surrounded that morning during a bilateral meeting between the chancellor and Mr Obama in the cellar of the Palais. “The French, the Italians all would be willing to do this,” said a member of the German delegation.  
&gt; But Mr Weidmann could not be moved.  
&gt; So when Mr Sarkozy quickly endorsed Mr Obama’s idea at the evening session, and turned to Ms Merkel for her support, she delivered the bad news: the Bundesbank had rejected it and she could not agree without the Bundesbank. She supported the plan politically, and if Italy agreed to the €80bn IMF programme she may be able to go to the Bundestag to increase the size of the rescue fund itself. But on SDRs, the answer was no.

Although the eurozone was on the brink of imploding because of Greece and Italy, it was Ms Merkel – whose economy was the stalwart anchor of the continent – who had been cornered. Mr Obama had agreed with the Italians that the IMF programme was a bad idea. “I think Silvio is right,” Mr Obama said.  
&gt; Mr Sarkozy attempted to manage the three-way impasse. The US wanted Germany to contribute its SDRs but Germany was only willing to give a partial commitment if Italy gave in on the IMF programme. Giulio Tremonti, Italy’s finance minister, held firm: Rome would accept IMF monitoring but no programme. Would the Italian monitoring plan, plus a commitment by Germany to contribute bilateral loans, be enough, Mr Sarkozy asked.  
&gt; “No. Germany has one-fourth of all [eurozone] SDR allocations,” Mr Obama objected. “If you have all the EU countries together but not Germany . . . it starts losing credibility.”  
&gt; Then came Ms Merkel’s tearful breakdown. “That is not fair. I cannot decide in lieu of the Bundesbank. I cannot do that.”  
&gt; The emotional outburst appeared to temper the American and French demands for an agreement there and then. “He saw that he went too far,” one European in the room said of Mr Obama.  
&gt; The US president asked whether Ms Merkel could work it out with the Bundesbank by Monday. Mr Sarkozy suggested finance ministers meet to agree the details before the summit ended the next day. Perhaps something vague could be mentioned in the summit’s communiqué, Mr Obama suggested. No, said Mr Sarkozy, but we could meet again in the morning.  
&gt; It was as if the two men had not heard her. She made the point again: “I’m not going to take such a big risk without getting anything from Italy. I’m not going to commit suicide.”  
&gt; And with that, the meeting ended. Leaving the late-night session, Mr Obama put his arm around Ms Merkel as if to comfort her – a scene captured by the White House’s official photographer. The image adorned the walls of the West Wing for months.  
&gt; The leaders met again the next morning but the momentum was gone. “The storm was over,” said one person at both meetings. The SDR plan would never again see the light of day. Italy would get a monitoring programme but no funding. And to compound the failure, Mr Berlusconi at his closing news conference publicly acknowledged what everyone had assiduously attempted to keep secret: that the IMF had offered him a rescue programme. Italy would suffer the stigma of needing a rescue but without receiving any assistance.  
&gt; The Cannes failure provided new oxygen to the eurozone fire. When markets reopened, Italian borrowing costs soared. Within the week they would nearly touch 7.5 per cent. Greece’s would go above 33 per cent, a level almost without precedent for a developed country. Now, with no new firewall in place, it was unclear what would save the euro.

À quel prix pour la France ?

Le solde net (contributions - fonds européens) de la France s'est nettement dégradé ces dix dernières années. Alors qu'il représentait moins de 400 millions d'euros en 1999, il a été multiplié par seize en dix ans. Les derniers chiffres que j'ai sont de [6,4 milliards d'euros par an](https://i.imgur.com/2ZhWw0q.png) pour la France.

Par habitant, [ça donne ça](https://i.imgur.com/UlzXBRL.png).

Et [selon le Sénat](http://www.senat.fr/commission/fin/pjlf2013/np/np32/np32_mono.html#toc238) ""ce statut de contributeur net devrait s'accentuer"". Tu m'étonnes qu'ils sont contents les autres !

Et les conséquences, ce sont des travailleurs détachés et de la concurrence de pays à bas coûts.

D'ailleurs, l'UE est [la première destination des délocalisations](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=ip1451) depuis la France.

On demande donc encore et toujours aux Français de se sacrifier et de donner de l'argent qu'ils n'ont pas pour des pays qui se moquent de nous, nous causent du tort et en plus nous montrent du doigt.

On a maintenant 5 millions de chômeurs et [entre 4,9 et 8,7 millions de pauvres](http://www.inegalites.fr/spip.php?article270), on ne peut plus se permettre ces conneries. La zone euro est par ailleurs [la zone de plus faible croissance au monde](http://www.ey.com/LU/en/Newsroom/News-releases/News_20140325_La-zone-euro-devrait-rester-a-la-traine-du-reste-du-monde-a-l-heure-de-la-reprise) et va le rester dans la prochaine décennie.

N'en déplaise aux eurobéats.

Hatte davon mal im englischsprachigen reddit gelesen, bin auch nicht in der Lage den Link zu finden, außer [das hier](http://www.debunking911.com), was aber auch schon sehr wisenschaftlich vor geht.

Wahrscheinlich hat meine unbekannte Quelle auch einfach irgendwelche Institutionen und Arbeitsgruppen aus Architekten Statiker u.ä. aufgebauscht, keine Ahnung. Zu finden sind die auf er wiki-page über die 9/11 Aufklärung unter den verschiedenen gruppen.

&gt;Ich bitte vielmals um Entschuldigung , dass ich denjenigen nicht glaube, die einen Krieg vom Zaun brechen, hunderttausende unschuldige im Irak und in Afghanistan töten ,weil sie 100% sicher sind ,dass der böse Diktator,den man selber unterstützt hat Massenvernichtungswaffen besitzt und die Terrorangriffe finanziert hat.

Gut, du scheinst ja einer von den Hartnäckigen zu sein.

Ich geb dir jetzt nen Auftrag. Einen Bildungsauftrag.

Du fndest im Internet alle Infos wie man jegliche Verschwörungstheorie zu 9/11 debunken kann. In meinem Link oben is das meiste weggefickt worden von der Scheiße. Auf wikipedia findet man sogar auch sehr viel, hab mir das vor Monaten mal alles durchgelesen.

Dann kommen dann so halbinformierte Typen wie du, labern iwas von physikalischen Anomalien, haben ihre Physik nicht gelernt und dann werden sie direkt widerlegt.

Scheitert diese Schiene also, kommt halt die government-planned Kacke und die kannste dir auch grad sonstwo hinschieben, da hilft dir deine OP Northwoods auch nicht. Denn ""geheime"" Geheimpläne zum Staatsterrorismus die so geheim sind, dass man sie auf Wikipedia findet, bringen mich höchstens zum lachen.

Ihr Witzfiguren hattet jetzt 13 Jahre Zeit zu beweisen, dass 9/11 ein inside job war. Bis jetzt gibts nichtmal den kleinsten Leak der irgendwas ansatzweise belegt. Nur Hypothesen und Geschwalle.

Dabei sind bei sovielen **echten** Verschwörungen **immer  Leaks** relativ zeitnah aufgetaucht. 

Liegt halt leider in der Natur der Sache, dass Verschwörungen immer über kurz oder lang auffliegen. **Die perfekte Verschwörung gibts genauso wenig wie das perfekte Verbrechen.** Oder denkst du das ernsthaft?

Wenn Ich jetzt in deinen Ton fallen würde, würde ich jetzt sowas sagen wie: ""schalt mal dein Gehirn ein und leg die BILD weg"". Leider is mir dein Infowars-Spiel aber zu kindisch.

Geb dir mal was du da schreibst. Und denk mal drüber nach, wie [absurd so ne Verschwörung wie du sie vorstellst](http://www.debunking911.com/meeting.htm) klingt und dann lies mal [Metaliteratur über Verschwörungstheorien](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verschw%C3%B6rungstheorie) und [Aussteigerberichte aus der Verschwörerszene.](http://roentgenbrille.blogspot.de/2014/03/skept-eine-verschworungstheoretikerin.html)

Taxes (and ""bribes"" the way you are talking about them, I don't think that you'd get to 700 *on average*, but there are people who where involved in bigger numbers) could not possibly solve the ""structural"" problems of the greek economy. 

The greek economy was structured like the stereotypical ""cronyist capitalism"" state. The whole thing was rigged in a way. Go read the wikipedia article on that, almost everything written there was happening, and still happens in Greece. In this particular case, the official tax numbers could be one thing, what you were really expected to pay another, and what you'd pay if you went against the ""system"" yet another number. I mean trust me, there is something deeply wrong in Greece, and yeah the average person is to some degree involved in it, but it doesn't have to do with the following things : paying taxes, laziness, lack of productivity. That's a pov from people in a country where things work that way.

It was all about corruption (which included lack of productivity on purpose). But one thing Scandinavians commenting on the sutuation are all right about, is that the greek society, say the ""unions"", never managed to get together and plan a realistic scheme. I bet in Sweden they more or less decided to not have a high and low class, they made the solution now, and expect to get positive benefits in the long run. In Greece, every group there is, tries to one up the other, usually by promoting their own corrupt politician in place. They are all like ""let me get the benefit now, and the solution will come in the long run"". And that keeps the whole ""cronyism"" running. And even socialists or something, instead of directly addressing the issue, (as was the case in le superior Sweden), they instead are like oh yeah the politicians are doing it to keep us divided, let's all work harder towards a *revolution*, and a pan european change of the economy blah blah blah. 

My point is the problem is that greek society is tolerant to a certain kind of corruption in a subtle way. Which in the long run puts the place on a dead end.

It depends. In Italy, the Constitution and law forbid the recreation of the fascist party, and it can be interpreted as far as ""any party that upholds the same goals as the fascist party"". I think in Germany they have the same law too. 

It stems from a different idea of free speech and association, which recognizes democracy as such a high value to deserve to be protected from itself. If your party stands for anti-democratic beliefs, you are placing yourself outside of democracy: if you deny it, you don't deserve to participate in it, since you aim at destroying it.

If you can't answer yes to both of theses questions I literally couldn't care less of what you think or not about the will of french people to speak english.

Why ?

Because you're only seeing one side of the coin. How the fuck can you pretend to know a specific aspect of a culture or of a country if you can't even fact check by speaking the language of said country ?

There is also a major problem with a romanian guy asking such a question.

Look at the scandinavians for instance. There was a swedish guy who did a crosspost between here and a swedish subreddit. This post basically was the lowest possibly hanging fruit, about the eurovision and french people being arrogant asshole who refuse to speak english.

A swedish guy. I mean come on.

France shares a pretty strong history with Britain, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Spain or even the Netherlands and Portugal (especially since there is a pretty big portuguese diaspora and a lot of french citizens with portuguese origin in France).
We all share common ancestors (to an extent), a common history since the Roman empire, we were constantly at war with each other since the fall of the western roman empire, we emigrate a lot in each other countries etc. So I won't mind being mocked by all thoses surrounding countries, it's fair game, we have strong ties with each one of them, we know each other pretty well.
The obsession of the british press with France being doomed can sometimes be unnerving, but you know, it's the british, I considere it pretty normal. I don't mind. Same with thoses other countries surrounding us.

But motherfucking Sweden ? Who the hell theses guys even are ? They are a handfull of people, whose presence online is disproportionately big when compared to IRL where we never really hear about them, except when someone say, for whatever reason, the word viking. But more importantly we don't share anything with them.
We don't have cliché about Scandinavia beyond them being blond because we have absolutely no idea who they are. We don't share a common history, we don't share a border with them, they have their own history up north that doesn't interest us.

But somehow they find a way to trashtalk us like if they had the same legitimacy than the british the germans or the spanish to do so. They don't really have a cliché about french people being stuborn asshole. The only thing that link them to us is their King being a direct descendant of a french general of Napoleon. No, they're just hopping on a bandwagon to do like the cool kids in western Europe.

Well, you're doing exactly the same thing my dear romanian friend (except I don't have anything against romanians on internet, unlike the scandinavians of the international subreddit, i.e. dickrhino and friends on polandball for instance).

Just ask yourself. Does that cliché of french people being stuborn asshole who refuse to speak english and think that they are better than anyone else really is a romanian thing ? Or is it just that you are picking on it because you spend a great deal of time in an international community (IRL or online) where the primary language and culture is the english/american one ?

And for the eurovision, if the swedish, danish and other finnish people are too ashamed of their own language or culture to proudly show them in an international event where the participants represent **the culture of their own fucking country** and not themselves it's their problem. 

Doesn't mean that we have to be neutered dogs ashamed of what we are like them and find every occasion to lick british balls.

Don't get me wrong. I have absolutely nothing against british or american culture or the english language. Like pretty much anyone else, I am actually quite fond of them, and even if I wasn't I can't really resent them for being successfull. If anything it's the people who want to give up on their own language or culture who are pitiful.

- benefit moochers, which is also quite wrong according to a [Swedish study](http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/bulgaria-romania.suy/), apparently Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants move abroad to work and they pay taxes while applying for a lot less social services than the locals      
- lazy/stupid, which in a way comes from arrogance or the superiority complex some western europeans have when talking about eastern europe (it's not true for all, but I've encountered specimens abroad who think that just because I come from Romania, I'm less of a person)                     
       
Romania is considered:        
- dirt poor, and although this is true for some parts, a lot of the bigger cities are starting to be comparable to western counterparts when it come to quality of life. Not there yet, but still pretty good places to live in if you have a decent wage.          
- corrupt, although very much true, I think things are getting better in this regard     
- slavs/slavic country; there are indeed strong slavic influences due to most of our neighbors being slavic, but the language is a romance one written in the latin alphabet, and the culture differs from other slavic countries.

Quasi ogni giorno rifletto su come possa essere limitato senza per questo tagliare via una fetta di meritevoli dal sacrosanto diritto di eleggere i propri rappresentanti.

L'idea di fondo, però, che io ho, è che il diritto di voto non è un diritto naturale. Non è qualcosa che viene garantito a priori soltanto perchè si è esseri umani, non è qualcosa che, a norma dell'art.2 della nostra Costituzione, viene ""riconosciuto e garantito"" dallo Stato. E' un diritto politico, e come tale può essere soggetto a limitazioni e a condizioni.
Per ora, la soluzione che più ho trovato accettabile è quella di sottoporre i cittadini che vogliono votare a un breve questionario di educazione civica e diritto costituzionale ogni due legislature; così che essi sappiano quali sono i loro diritti, come possano venire rispettati, come possano venire limitati e perchè; così che abbiano una idea di come si forma e si governa uno Stato; così che sappiano come funziona la Repubblica Italiana. Il questionario dovrebbe svolgersi similmente a come si svolge già quello per la parte teorica della patente, con costi bassi e un dispendio limitato di tempo. In caso di fallimento, il cittadino non può votare per due legislature.

Le CDD, l'intérim et le SSII c'est très bien mais ca ne remplace pas complétement des permanents flexibles. Surtout, comme je l'évoque plus haut, quand on a des procédés très spécialisés (l'Allemagne est beaucoup plus automatisée que la France, donc il faut une formation plus spécifique a la boite).

Quant a l'agriculture, l'un n'empêche pas l'autre. L'agriculture est beaucoup plus stratégique pour la Nouvelle Zélande que pour la France. Et pourtant ils ont tout libéralisé : suppression des fonctionnaires, des subventions et des barrières douanières. Du coup ils ont des produits de très grande qualité qu'ils exportent aux chinois.

Tu dis qu'on ne peut pas tous adopter la stratégie irlandaise ou allemande : c'est absolument vrai ! On ne peut pas tous faire la même chose. Donc, quelle est la stratégie française qui n'implique ni de changer les autres (utopie), ni le repli sur soi (ce que très peu d'autres pays éprouvent le besoin de faire). La France ne manque pas d'atouts !

No, screw that attitude. This is why Russia can act with total impunity. Real sanctions hurt both sides, though of course they hurt the targeted country more. But it seems like Western countries are not willing to sacrifice anything at all, so no real sanctions happen.

And yes, these ships are very important to Russia. Their navy has suffered much more than other forces in the post-Soviet era, and Russia currently lacks sufficient power projection capabilities. The Mistrals would give Russia the capability to effectively launch amphibious assaults on territories that they do not border, such as Japanese islands (which is where Russia wants the ships deployed).

EU politicians need to draw a fine line with potential EU accession. It's essentially held as a carrot in front of the country, to get them moving in the right direction. If you give them the carrot too soon, they become members without enacting the political reforms they need and the EU loses the only leverage it had to make them do this (see: Hungary). If you hold the carrot too far away, then they lose interest in the carrot entirely, and yet again it becomes very difficult to get them to enact the necessary reforms (see: Turkey). 

So in essence you need to dangle the carrot as close as possible, but without them actually reaching it, for as long as possible until they begin to lose interest (and then you give it to them).

&gt; **Fate of the Danube-Schwabians after autumn 1944**

&gt; In the autumn of 1944, before the invasion of the Red Army and the takeover of power by the partisans, the civilians Danube-Schwabian population either escaped or were evacuated from Sirmia and Slavonia (more than 90 %), from the Batschka and the Baranja-Triangle (about half), and from the western Banat (only about 15 %).

&gt; “The 5th of October was a warm, sunny autumn day, as we experienced it on the plain of the old homeland. The fields displayed their gorgeous autumn colours, the cornfields showing their ripe, golden cobs and dry leaves, and in the vineyards the grapes were ripening on the vines. The streets of Franztal (Franz Valley) were teeming with terrified and desperate people. Among them school children with irritated faces in front of the school building, which refused to admit them. One neighbor was hurrying to the other, seeking advice, which he couldn’t give him, because he was at a loss himself. The thought of having to leave home and to head towards the country roads, without possessions and destination, was so unthinkable that one was led to believe that a bad dream had befallen the people. But in the harshness of reality time was running short. The church bell incessantly tolled the hours, mercilessly reminding everybody that the time of parting was drawing nearer and nearer.”

&gt; Except for the 90,000 soldiers, there were at least 195,000 Danube-Schwabians in their native lands at the time of the Communist takeover, and they were dispossessed and deprived of their rights through the decisions of the AVNOJ. In the Banat, in the Batschka and in Sirmia more than 7,000 civilians had been murdered by local Communist groups, the state police (OZNA), and partisan commando units during the “Bloody Autumn of 1944” in the course of the Operation Intelligenzija.

&gt; The majority of the remaining 170,000 Danube-Schwabian civilians were imprisoned in numerous labours and – in total – eight concentration camps, which had been built for old, aged and sick people as well as for children under 14 years of age and mothers with little children. The concentration camps soon turned out to be extermination camps. In the Batschka, there were camps at Jarek (Backi Jarak), totaling 7,000 deaths, Gakowa (Gakovo), totaling 8,500 deaths, and Kruschiwl (Krusevlje), totaling 3,000 – 3,500 deaths.

&gt; “At five o’clock in the morning we were all rounded up. At the camp and also during our work the warders and the guards heavily beat us. I was beaten three times; one time so badly I could not sit down for a month. The partisan who hit me used a stick for it.”
(Report from the extermination camp Gakowa)

&gt; In the Banat, there were the camps Molidorf (Molin), totalling 3,000 deaths, and Rudolfsgnad (Knicanin), totaling 11,000 deaths; in Sirmia the camp Seidenfabrik (Silk Factory) in Syrmisch Mitrowitz (Sremska Mitrovica), totaling 2,000 deaths. In Slavonia, there were the camps Walpach (Valpovo), totaling 1,000 – 2,000 deaths, and Kerndia (Krndija), totaling 500 – 1,500 deaths.

&gt; “The sick and the dying were lying on the ground on a thin layer of straw, like everywhere else in the camp, close together, only separated by loosely set bricks. Between the sick people stood and lay dirty bowls, broken dishes with disgusting leftovers, pots serving as cuspidors, unclean chamber pots, dry slices of inedible corn bread, filthy rags, and similar things. Amidst all this misery, there were the dying, in dirty clothes, in filthy rags, in their own faeces. Smells and odors were almost unbearable. Here, the final tragedy of our people took place. I never saw my people as miserable and beaten as here, and at the same time never so proud and brave.” (Report from the extermination camp Rudolfsgnad).

&gt; In total, 50,000 of the imprisoned Danube-Schwabians had perished through hunger, epidemics and shootings in the labour and concentration camps within three years. About 35,000 had succeeded in escaping from the camps, at the risk of their own lives, across the near borders to Hungary and Romania.

&gt; From 1946 on, thousands of orphaned children were transferred from the camps to children’s homes and had to undergo radical slavisation. Additionally, around the turn of the year 1944/45, more than 8,000 women between 18 and 35 years of age and more than 4,000 men between 16 and 45 years of age were deported from the Batschka and the Banat to the USSR to do forced labour. 2,000 of them had perished miserably by 1949.

&gt; The genocide of the Danube-Schwabians resulted in more than 60,000 civilian victims. In 1948, the camps were dissolved. The approx. 80,000 survivors of the genocide had to accept three-year labour contracts and were only able to buy themselves out of these, depositing a high “ransom”, in the 50s, and then could leave for Germany or Austria; usually destitute.

&gt; **Gorges and Karst Caves in Slovenia**

&gt; The chairman of the first Slovenian government after 1945, Boris Kidriè, publicly announced at the town square in Maribor: “The remainders of ‘Germanness’ in the northern territories have to disappear. It is unbearable that these remainders still go for walks on Slovenian and Yugoslavian soil. Those people, who have sucked the sweat off our nation, those people, who have helped to enslave our nation, are no longer allowed to stay here. It cannot be that in our kolkhoz there are still people who once lived off the diligence and sweat of our winegrowers and exploited them.”

&gt; The majority of the German Lower-Styrians and Gottscheers were only allowed to flee from the approaching front after the 6 May 1945, which resulted in a part of the German civilian population being helplessly exposed to Tito-Partisan terror. Atrocious mass executions had, for example, occurred in Bachern/Pohorje, where more than 2,000 German civilians had been killed. A similar tragedy took place in the Gottscheer Hornwald (Gottschee Horn Forest).

&gt; According to estimates, more than 6,000 civilian Germans fell victim to outbreaks of violence and the Communist execution units of the OZNA on Slovenian territory. After the English occupation force had closed the borders to Carinthia and Styria for German refugees, labour and concentration camps were erected for the Germans, among which the camps in Sterntal (Strnisce) and Tüchern (Teharje) with 7,000 deaths were most notorious. “Part of the refugees were loaded onto lorries, and it was those who were killed at Tüchern. The majority, however, were murdered right away, or rather at the Gottscheer Hornwald.

&gt; Tüchern was horrible. It was not only the camp where the refugees were shot; the greatest parts of the dissidents were also killed here, as well as those who had been found to be traitors, and especially the wealthy locals. The shootings only took place in the evening hours. Soon the ground around the camp was filled with bodies. From day to day more people were put on the death list.

Une invasion russe ?

Tu y crois vraiment ?

Et les armes de destruction massives en Iraq, tu y crois encore ?

L'espionnage n'est pas du mépris, c'est une composante de la stratégie de domination américaine, celle que dénonçait Mitterrand :

""La France ne le sait pas, mais nous sommes en guerre avec l’Amérique . Oui, une guerre permanente, une guerre vitale, une guerre économique, une guerre sans mort apparemment. Oui, ils sont très durs les américains, ils sont voraces, ils veulent un pouvoir sans partage sur le monde. C’est une guerre inconnue, une guerre permanente, sans mort apparemment et pourtant une guerre à mort.""

L'UE a déstabilisé l'Ukraine sur ordre de son maimaitre américain. Poutine résiste et il est dans l'intérêt de la France de résister aux américains.

Pour l'invasion russe, je citerais de Gaulle :

""Quant à imposer le joug totalitaire à trois cents millions d'étrangers récalcitrants, à quoi bon le Kremlin s'y essayerait-il, alors qu'il a grand-peine à le maintenir sur trois fois moins de sujets satellites ?""

""Mon dessein consiste donc à dégager la France, non pas de l'alliance atlantique que j'entends maintenir à titre d'ultime précaution, mais de l'intégration réalisée par l'O.T.A.N. sous commandement américain ; à nouer avec chacun des Etats du bloc de l'Est et, d'abord, avec la Russie des relations visant à la détente, puis à l'entente et à la coopération ; à en faire autant, le moment venu, avec la Chine. ""

true,gamas,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I decided to read up on this (won't lie [my source is wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_history_in_Russia)), since I find the homophobia odd as well (since homophobia is actually completely anti-communist, since communism promotes a secular society with equal rights for all).

The summary I can give is that apparently Russia was one of the first European countries to abolish anti-homosexual laws (after the Bolveshik revolution in 1917, the new Communist government abolished all Tsarist laws on sexual relationships effectively making homosexuality legal) and even had openly gay politicians working in government.  They also apparently sent a delegation to Germany in the 1930s to encourage them to change their laws and allow homosexuality.

Where it all went wrong (as could be said about everything else that went wrong with the USSR) was when Stalin took power.  Stalin, being a rather paranoid bloke, reinstated anti-homosexuality laws with the rhetoric that gays were part of a right-wing fascist conspiracy.  He encouraged anti-gay propaganda pretty much conflating gay people with paedophiles, even after the objections of a British communist.  When he died, the new government pretty much continued his propaganda, now conflating homosexuality with prison rape.  This propaganda then pretty much ran rampant through the rest of the USSR.

The legalisation of homosexuality in 1993 was only after intense pressure from the Council of Europe to do so. 

What doesn't help is that the Russian Orthodox Church was always vehemently against homosexuality (those Orthodox churches are stubborn like that).  

tl;dr The current homophobia is the result of Stalinist propaganda gone rampant combined with the increasing influence of the Russian Orthodox Church in the Russian Federation.  The pre-Stalinist USSR was actually quite good in terms of LGBT rights...",0,1399903389,null,0,false,0,chfxlyf,t3_25akpi,t1_chfxlyf,t1_chfu9ni,null,1433761174,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,emergency_poncho,EURO,European Union,"The idea is to build strong, long-lasting democratic institutions, because history has proven that robust liberal democracies rarely (if ever) slide back into totalitarianism, but weak, fledgling democracies quite often do.

So essentially, the EU uses the carrot of accession to ensure that weak democracies build strong democratic institutions and traditions, and ensure that they are firmly Western, liberal and democratic states. The EU has been extraordinarily successful at this. Just 20 or 30 years ago, all countries in Eastern Europe had just come out of 30 years of totalitarian Soviet rule, with few to no democratic institutions (not to mention Western European far-right autocracies, like Spain and Portugal, in the 70s and early 80s). Now the vast majority of Eastern European countries are solidly democratic, with little to no chance of back-sliding to their totalitarian days.

So it's not quite right to infuse politics with morality. We can't really expect countries or politics to be altruistic - in politics, every single policy is decided by weighing pros and cons. If the expected negatives of a policy don't outweigh the expected positives, then it's unlikely that policy will get implemented.

Pour l'extrême gauche :

Le bureau politique du PCF publiait un communiqué le 12 mai déclarant : ""il faut tout de suite châtier impitoyablement et rapidement les organisateurs de la révolte et les hommes de main qui ont dirigé l'émeute"" au nom de la défense ""de la république française, métropole et territoires d'outre-mer, une et indivisible."" 

Dans un tract signé par cinq membres du comité central et distribué sur le sol algérien, il appelle à une chasse aux sorcières et lance de véritables appels au meurtre et aux pogroms en exigeant de ""passer par les armes les instigateurs de la révolte et les hommes de main qui ont dirigé l'émeute. Il ne s'agit pas de vengeance ni de représailles. Il s'agit de mesures de justice. Il s'agit de mesures de sécurité pour le pays"". 

Ainsi une milice mise sur pied par le PC et la CGT servit d'auxiliaire à la police et à l'armée pour massacrer entre 500 et 700 ""rebelles musulmans"".

- Italy's cost of corruption is not 60 bloody billions. This comes up in every damn thread that touches upon the subject.

&gt; Beim ESC-Finale gab es dieses Jahr eine ähnliche Diskrepanz, wie die erstmals von ESC veröffentlichten Abstimmungsergebnisse zeigen. Beim Publikum lag Conchita Wurst mit ""Rise Like a Phoenix"" weit vorne - die deutsche Jury mochte sich der Euphorie jedoch nicht anschließen. Von Sängerin Madeline Juno, Musik-Manager Konrad Sommermeyer, Sänger Andreas Bourani und Rapper Sido gab es gar keine Punkte für die Österreicherin. Einzig ""Jennifer Rostock""-Sängerin Jennifer Weist sah Conchita Wurst auf Platz 9 und somit zweier Punkte würdig. Weil Jury und Publikum jeweils die Hälfte zur Gesamtbewertung beitragen, reichte es am Ende trotzdem für Platz 4 und sieben Punkte.

Dieser Tenor ist aber in allen österreichischen Medien ähnlich. Hippe deutsche Bands sind eigentlich verkappte Nazis. Sido brüllte auf der ESC Bühne ja noch Live ""Conchita ...sowas ist krank. Das ist doch nur krank."" Und das sagt jemand der einen Arschficksong performt.

Außer Deutschland hat nur noch die russische und die portugisische Jury so gegen eine Dragqueen gewertet und über Russland zieht der hohe Rat der Moral im deutschen Fernsehen ja kontinuierlich her.

Die Frage wäre: Ist der NDR mit allen involvierten, also Fans, Jury, Elisia Band, Live Performances von Helene Fischer usw. überhaupt noch tragbar? Oder sind die deutschen Medien so rechts, dass man Dragqueens live als ""krank"" beschimpfen darf?

Die Mehrheit der Telefonanrufer hat Conchita auf #1 gewählt, aber das waren die selben Idioten die auch den deutschen Teilnehmer mit der fetten Plumpskuh dahin geschickt haben.
Demokratische Verfahren machen ja nur Sinn, wenn nicht nur die dümmsten des Landes wählen. Eine Jury macht gar keinen Sinn und man kann sich für die deutschen Künstler in der Jury nur noch schämen.

In France, for example, white bread was heavily restricted so that only the nobility could eat it. In addition to this, grain was in such short supply that people resorted to eating grass. The whole reason they called us 'rosbif' is because a typical English peasant was able to regularly have beef at least once a week, usually Sunday.

The change came about after the French revolution when the nobility was deposed. Their cooks would either open restaurants or flee to England and in order to work for the British nobility. They essentially created the myth of bad British food in order to create a demand for French chefs and it still continues nowadays. 

The final nail in the coffin was rationing. When American soldiers were based in the UK during WWII, food supplies were cut off since we were surrounded by u-boats. Food was limited to extremely small amounts of meat, cheese, sugar, eggs (powdered), tea and whatever you can grow in your garden. Fruit, chocolate and nuts were completely unavailable and most meats and fish were very rarely available. Any items available were never fresh and were always tinned or preserved.

Jap, soweit korrekt.

&gt;Wenn nun jemand einen Artikel über Sinti/Roma postet und diesen fälschlicherweise mit ""Antiziganistischer Überfall in Schwäbisch Gmünd"" betitelt, dann versucht dieser jemand ja nun die Tatsachen so zu verdrehen, als ob es einen Überfall (auf die Sinti/Roma) mit einem (mutmaßlichen) antiziganistischem Hintergrund gegeben hätte.
Wieso sollte ein rechter Troll die Tatsachen in diese Richtung verdrehen. Das stellt ja die Sinti/Roma als Opfer dar.

Um darzustellen, das es bei antiziganistischen Überfällen (aus Blick des rechten Trolls) um eine Verdrehung der Lage handelt. ""Antiziganismus gibt es nicht, das ist eine Erfindung der Politisch Korrekten/Systempresse/rote SA/Grünfaschisten/[rechtes Feindbild Nr. X] bzw. Antiziganismus ist aufgrund des Verhaltens der 'Zigeuner' berechtigt"" etc. 

Er persifliert die Berichterstattung über antiziganistische Übergriffe, so wie er sie sieht, nämlich das es keine solche Übergriffe gibt, bzw. diese immer selbst herbeigeführt wären, da ja die Roma/Sinti im Vorfeld Ärger gemacht hätten. Dieser Link sollte wohl nur eine Darstellung davon sein. In den ""Medien""(r/de) wird von antiziganistischen Vorfall gesprochen, in der ""Realität""(der eigentliche Bericht) gibt es Streß mit Roma/Sinti, der dann (von Seiten der Roma/Sinti) eskaliert. Es ist also einfach die Darstellung der empfundenen Dichotomie von Mediendarstellung und der Realität an einem Beispiel, mit der Implizierung das das in den üblichen Medien auch immer so wäre.

&gt; Übrigens nach mehrmaligen Durchlesen fällt mir auf, dass der Urheber des Artikels in der Überschrift und in der Präambel eine ""Krähe"" erwähnt, diese im eigentlichen Nachrichtentext aber garnicht mehr auftaucht.

&gt;

&gt;The __Bechdel test__ (/ˈbɛkdəl/ *__BEK__-dəl*) asks whether a work of [fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction) features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. The requirement that the two women must be named is sometimes added. Many contemporary works fail this test of [gender bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_bias). On average, films that pass the test have been found to have a lower budget than others, but of comparable or better financial performance.

&gt;The test is named after the American cartoonist [Alison Bechdel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Bechdel). In 1985, she had a character in her comic strip *[Dykes to Watch Out For](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dykes_to_Watch_Out_For)* voice the idea, which she attributed to a friend, Liz Wallace. The test was originally conceived for evaluating films but has since been applied to other media. It is also known as the __Bechdel/Wallace test__,  the __Bechdel rule__,  __Bechdel's law__,  or the __Mo Movie Measure__.

No, taxes solely can not solve anything, for any country, but not paying them and having a dodgy system, where everyone gets away with not paying/paying less is part of the whole economic mess that is part of the Greek system. And, from what I have understood, the average Greek *do* bribe. Not as much, nor do they make as much money on it as some politicians, but the average Greek dodge taxes. And bribe. 

&gt;The greek economy was structured like the stereotypical ""cronyist capitalism"" state. The whole thing was rigged in a way. Go read the wikipedia article on that, almost everything written there was happening, and still happens in Greece. In this particular case, the official tax numbers could be one thing, what you were really expected to pay another, and what you'd pay if you went against the ""system"" yet another number. I mean trust me, there is something deeply wrong in Greece, and yeah the average person is to some degree involved in it, but it doesn't have to do with the following things : paying taxes, laziness, lack of productivity. That's a pov from people in a country where things work that way.

Greece have lower productivity, but they are not lazier. Those two are not necissarily connected. But, they are worse at paying taxes. 


&gt;My point is the problem is that greek society is tolerant to a certain kind of corruption in a subtle way. Which in the long run puts the place on a dead end. The stuff about laziness, productivity, tax evasion etc., those things have a certain degree of truth to them but are ultimately all misguided.

Again, I don't think the Greeks are lazy. I do not why you keep claiming that. But they are extremly good at dodging taxes. And they have a lower productivity, but that doesn't have to imply laziness. A Kenyan might have lower productivity than a Greek - doesn't mean he is lazier than the Greek, just different production/equipment/education/factories/cultures/society etc.That is easy to check btw, productivity per worker. Go to OECD, they have stats that prove that Greeks have lower productivity than Dutch for example. So, I do not know why you claim that the Greeks have equal productivity to the north, that is simply not true. But learn to separate productivity from laziness, they do not have to be connected.

And, you seem to describe the Greek society as a corrupt society with cronyism. Is that correct? It is not really surprising that a society like that doesn't stand up to the competitition if competing with effective, less corrupt societies. Corrupt societies are less effective. And, the bad news is that the Greek built that society. The good news is that since they built it, they can change it.But, until they do, they will continue to have problems.

Our racism led to the oppression of the native population of Africa (a memory that should still be clear in our heads due to the policies of Apartheid South Africa), and prevented the development of any infrastructure that could actually help the native population.

Our actions created a continent of people who are in the best case held back culturally, and in the worst case completely confused in cultural identity (due to the pollution of incompatible European culture - the tribal politics of traditional African cultures is incompatible with the western-model of democracy).

Who decides what is a manipulated majority? I mean this whole political correctness phase the world is going through could also be seen as a manipulated majority. What I'm getting at is, that it is hard to be objective and claim that one opinion is worse than another just because you yourself think so or the majority or minority thinks so.

Times change, opinions change and what is the norm and acceptable also changes. Back in the day slavery was completely ok, so was pedophilia (way back in the day), not to forget that it was completely ok that women weren't allowed to vote. Back then someone opposing this would have easily been called a manipulated majority.

Fact is that most humans just align themselves to whatever is the most mainstream opinion. I'd bet my left ball that more than half of the people screaming racist on reddit today would call people liberal idiots 20 years from now if being against immigration or racial equality would become the norm.

The faster we accept that most people don't really have an opinion the better, and then we can let the world take its course and hope for the best. There is no such thing as a perfect world as even the opinion of what would be a perfect world changes from time to time. This is why allowing all opinions to be free is important.

People from N Europe live in a place where the tax system, ""works as advertised"". It works as planned, at least to a high degree. The rules are clear, you pay what you are supposed to, it gets where it is supposed to go. 

So when they see economical problems in a country with tax evation going on, they are inclined to focus on that part, as one of the main problems.

But the difference is, in Greece the tax system is a mess. By some interpretation of the laws you are supposed to pay 10, but when you go to the tax collector he'll laugh at you and be like ""don't be stupid"" and ask you for 1. Or for 1 and a bribe. You don't give the bribe yourself, the system is made that way. Yet if some competitor has better connections than you or something you will suddenly be asked to pay 10. Here read this paragraph from the wiki article

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crony_capitalism
&gt;Intentionally ambiguous laws and regulations are common in such systems. Taken strictly, such laws would greatly impede practically all business; in practice, they are only erratically enforced. The specter of having such laws suddenly brought down upon a business provides incentive to stay in the good graces of political officials. 

What I am arguing is, some people in N Europe are under the impression that the system was there, but people chose to ignore it. Except the system wasn't there, the system was rigged all along. Many people were even *forced* to ignore it. Yet some people chose to keep it in place, and my explanation is that thing in the above post, the short term benefit, and seeking influence for achieving it, and leaving the problem for ""the next government"", or the ""next EU financing package"", or for ""after the revolution""",0,1399910708,null,0,false,0,chg0ql3,t3_25bcoo,t1_chg0ql3,t1_chfz7qm,null,1433762649,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Nel frattempo, ci teniamo il senato.

The problem is that whatever the west does or doesn't its always a problem. The unique cultural ""landscape"" and ""trying to force political model and culture that is simply incompatible""? Should we say that go back to living in clay huts and rape children to cure yourself from AIDS as it's part of your unique culture or try to guide them towards a sustainable society? Unique cultural landscape... well sure it's unique but that cannot be said to be the reason why they cannot adapt to the rest of the world politically or do you suggest that they should have their own little way of doing things?

The basic infrastructure can be erected by the people of Africa deciding that they want to do so. It will need social change and stopping the in fighting and not a single African nation can be said to have succeeded at it in long term no matter how much we leave them alone. Look at Zimbabwe, it used to be the bread basket of Africa and now its a corrupt hell hole and we cannot blame anyone else for that than the people of Zimbabwe themselves. Because if we are completely honest and look at history Zimbabwe went to shit right after they were given the power to run themselves.

true,352235,null,null,"&gt;You are kind of giving an answer as if I attacked your argument. I didn't, and I am not against taxation or something. What I am saying is that there is a ""cultural"" misconception .

I apologize for that. I appreciate your information a lot. Thank you. 

&gt;What I am arguing is, some people in N Europe are under the impression that the system was there, but people chose to ignore it. Except the system wasn't there, the system was rigged all along.

That is enlightning, thank you. 

&gt;People from N Europe live in a place where the tax system, ""works as adevrtised"". It works as panned, at least to a high degree. The rules are clear, you pay what you are supposed to, it gets where it is supposed to go.

&gt;So when they see economical problems in a country with tax evation going on, they are inclined to focus on that part, as one of the main problems.

We are not quite that naive, but a bit perhaps a tad. My question is then - why haven't they changed it? I mean, system can change, that is not an issue. Look at nations like Vietnam, Estonia, Chile etc. It is undisputable, it is possible to change nations that were/are in a far more hopeless (and more corrupt) situation than Greece. And Greece has been a working democracy since 1973 (wasn't it)as well, something some of those countries could only dream of. My theory is that the population have been getting used to short terms benefits and never asked to much, because it was comfortable for them to. I mean, it is nice not to pay taxes. Who is going to argue if you can get away with less? And in a way I understand that, but one then also have to understand the backlash from the north. As you say ""waiting for the next EU financing package"". That is our money, our tax money. And we don't care if it is a poorly built system, then we want to know why they have constructed it that way. And that is a legitimate question. Why have they? Why haven't they changed it? 

But, all those questions should perhaps not been adressed during the Euro crises. I don't think the Greek system, no matter how faulty, is the reason for the Euro crises. It is however, a reason why Greece will have it tougher to come back and why people are fed up with it. Had they tried to start battle it in the 70's/80's, it wouldn't be so difficult now either. 

But if the Greeks ever want to be a competitive modern state they have to start changing. The question is, why isn't that happening? I guess that is a milion Euro/Nobel prize question....I honestly do not understand it. Do you?

The irony if someone saying that and then talking down on France talking about how dare they go against the EU, the US and not be 100% antagonistic towards Russia and how everybody needs to collectively suffer to collectively punish Russia.

The irony of someone saying that whilst completely ignoring anyone that dares to speak out against the increasing federalisation and super state structure of the EU. The complete subservient attitude towards the US and the numerous unending wars each country is getting itself involved in.

The irony of ignoring the history of how the West has influenced and organised many revolutions against democracies and organised steadfast support for dictatorships.

Non. Les conséquences de l'Union Européenne sont les travailleurs détachés ET l'augmentation des contributions françaises.

Donc l'UE coûte à la France. Par contre, j'attends toujours de voir ce qu'elle rapporte. C'est marrant vous êtes toujours à demander des sources quand on critique votre position, mais jamais à en donner pour expliquer comme c'est bien l'UE et combien ça nous rapporte.

true,gamas,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; do you suggest that they should have their own little way of doing things?

That is precisely what I am saying.  Part of the problem is that African countries are still trying to work within the framework of European government - which is mostly because they can't afford the luxury of experimenting with another system.  What has been discovered in Africa is that what works for Europe, doesn't work for Africa.  In an ideal world, we would have never tried to colonise Africa, and simply let them develop things their own way.  Unfortunately, all we can really do is lighten their burden by subsidising their economies to compensate for the inefficiencies caused by their incompatible government system until their economies are stable enough for them to reform.  (Luckily as I said, since the 2000s most African economies have experienced a boom, so we might get to that state by the end of the century...)

&gt; The basic infrastructure can be erected by the people of Africa deciding that they want to do so. It will need social change and stopping the in fighting and not a single African nation can be said to have succeeded at it in long term no matter how much we leave them alone.

See here's the problem, because there is a lack of basic infrastructure, there are barely any schools.  No schools means lack of education.  Lack of education means a lack of awareness amongst the population to know what needs to be done to turn the country into a thriving economy.  Can't you see the fundamental issue here?

Well, sometimes this is the case but sometimes not.

In that case, it's the Bundesbank entrenchment to their ideology that is surprising. One would think they would be more practical than this.

true,RamblinRambo,FINL,Finland,"&gt;See here's the problem, because there is a lack of basic infrastructure, there are barely any schools. No schools means lack of education. Lack of education means a lack of awareness amongst the population to know what needs to be done to turn the country into a thriving economy. Can't you see the fundamental issue here?

Actually I need to let you in on a secret, my second masters is in Economic Geography so these issues aren't exactly new to me. This is why I am a little opposed to the whole idea of western intervention in Africa and wanted to play a little of a devils advocate with you.

The lack of schools and infrastructure is actually more of a political issue than an purely economical one. The issue comes from the fact that corruption is widely spread in the whole of Africa. Money from natural resources and western aid has basically all the time gone down the pocket of the political leaders in Africa and not to the improvement of their people. In many cases we could argue that western monetary aid helps these corrupt officials to stay in power prolonging the development in Africa.

The one big blame I open handedly am willing to place on the colonial powers is the division of Africa. What once were hundreds and thousands of different tribes and societies who had boarders and ""own"" areas of land became either divided by a line drawn with a ruler or lumped into a country with a hundred more cultures that were completely different. As if we'd take Greece and lump in in with Turkey and expect them to get along without issues. This is still a huge issue and reason for conflicts in many African nations.

One thing that would be interesting is if the different countries in Africa which are huge land masses were allowed to separate into smaller countries.

I'll try to respond to your question as simple as possible: For Poland you were just another invader.  

1. But we could have it better without your occupation and if you could just let us decide our fate. Freedom for us means everything. (having free elections after the war, accepting marshall plan denied by stalin, no communist opression).

2. The fact that the USSR killed a lot of it's own people, thus diminishing the severity of crimes against other nations is non-argument. (""I know we killed a lot of you, but we killed a lot of ourselves too. So no big deal right?"")

3. We don't really equalize Nazi-rule to Soviet rule. We are full aware that Nazi-rule would have most Poles (and the rest of eastern-europe) send to camps enslaved and murdered. 

About rationalizing formation of SS divisions: Poland was the only nation occupied by the Nazi's without a national SS division (Russia, ukraine, Lithuania etc. had one)

Consider this: You were our liberators of Nazi rule (the single most terrible event in Polish history), how bad you must have fucked up for Polish people to dislike you.. give i some thought.

So when filling IRPF tax just declare whatever you have paid in the UK for those incomes (box 505).  

As strange as it may sound you may declare -theoretically- that your property is rented during the whole year for 0€. In that scenario Renta Imputada will be 0 and so your Net Rental Income.

Look at nations like Vietnam, Estonia, Chile etc. It is undisputable, it is possible to change nations that were/are in a far more hopeless (and more corrupt) situation than Greece. And Greece has been a working democracy since 1973

I can give a few generic answers, that have to do with the ""culture"" (I mostly talked about them above), and one that is historical and I am not sure if you have the context to fully get it but anyway.

First of all there was a case of people being ""overoptimistic"". The kind of overoptimism you see happening when ""groupthink"" is taking place. For example for you to get the idea, back in 2003-2006 people were complaining cause there was ""too much construction work"".

- ""Who is paying for this, is it even useful?""

- ""The Germans are paying and they don't care"" 

People were under the impression that the economy will just correct itself through some banking trick.  So they thought ""then what I have to do is not be stupid and go and grab some piece of it"". See also the Greek ""stock exchange period"" back in 2001. Or another example is how the leftist parties, instead of giving out a coherent plan that could realistically be carried out, went out saying stuff like ""the minimun wage should rise to 1600 euros"".

So 1) overoptimism 2) the tendency to ""grab the piece of the pie now"", as in short term, failure of long term planning cause X thinks he can get more now and let Y find a way to do it in the future 3) everyone would ""secure economical rights by law"" once you are in power (example: private sector unemployment vs public sector no job loss risk) 4) failure to create any realistic ""collectivist"" plans (unions indirectly fight each other) other than bringing up vague and unrealistic ideas about a ""revolution"" that is supposed to happen in the future 5) from the above things you get partisanship and then 6) ""corrupt people that managed to get influence"" that now sort of direct how things are run, and are also easy to cooperate with the ""oligarchs"", the ""shipping magnates"" and all that

The historical reason is that Greece before the 80s had a right wing ""upper class"". Those that didn't belong to it were (economically or even politically) to some extent ""second rate citizens"". Then Andreas Papandreou in the 80s came to introduce socialism and ""correct that injustice"". Except he did it all wrong. Too much corruption. Then the right wingers wanted to do the same. Then the socialists. I mean I am not describing this correctly but Greece was historically affected by some kind of partisanship, where parties take turns looting the place and installing their people, then waiting for their ""revenge"" and the country hasn't managed to escape that yet. Imo the solution is that greece does a long term plan, that aims at abolishing the low and upper classes, as well as aggressively attempt to get rid of any doubts any pending money owed etc. and bring businesses around in the near term.",0,1399915104,null,0,1399915333,0,chg2t39,t3_25bcoo,t1_chg2t39,t1_chg155j,null,1433763624,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Actually, the Soviet regime sent to work camps and murdered many more people than the Nazis ever did. Of course, the Nazis were more aggressive and their killings were in a much shorter time span, but hey, the raw numbers are incomparable. (You made the same point in your post)

Not only that the Germans did not decimate Eastern Europe (not even when we fought against them), but the Russians were monsters (even when we were allies). When the Russian army passed trough Romania they raped, murdered, destroyed and stole everything they could.

In short, I would say you're asking the wrong question. It's not your people, or your history, it's your government. Europe has a very long and messy history. Every country has been invaded as well as having done some invading themselves. Germany has a rather *recently* marred past, yet Germany is a respected world leader.


In present day Europe, most countries have rather normalized opinions of each other, despite all of the attacks and invasions of history. People don't have an issue with Russians, the people themselves. Unfortunately at Eurovision this year, the two innocent Russian sisters were booed just because they were from Russia, which was complete bullshit. I'm glad people still voted for them when it came down to points, but booing 17 year old (I think) girls for political reasons is just childish.

The principle of self determination would tell us no Western nation is allowed to be critical of the laws passed in these countries, yet we know that is not the case.

&gt;__Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI)__ is a [telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone) [surveying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey) technique in which the interviewer follows a script provided by a software application. It is a structured system of [microdata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(statistics\)) collection by telephone that speeds up the collection and editing of microdata and also permits the interviewer to educate the respondents on the importance of timely and accurate data.  The software is able to customize the flow of the questionnaire based on the answers provided, as well as information already known about the participant. It is a very important software and plays a vital role in B2B services.

2. If Russians have suffered so much under the Soviets, then why do they basically worship the good old times and want them to come back?

3. The Nazi occupation lasted 6 years, the Soviet occupation (because the People's Republic surely couldn't be considered an independent country) lasted 44 years. Also, Stalin and the Soviets killed more people than the Nazis, only their crimes weren't as publicized. They also didn't target any particular ethnic or religious group, they killed everyone they didn't like indiscriminately.

&gt; So, what do you think it will take to put the past behind us?

true,doctorheredoctor,BELG,Belgium,"**I think you have to consider the prelude to the post-war years before framing your questions:**

1) USSR annexes Baltic states, forces Romania to give up Bessarabia with threat of invasion, invades Finland

2) USSR allies with Third Reich and invades Poland

3) USSR only fights Third Reich when attacked itself (England, France declared war in honor of treaties without being attacked themselves)

4) USSR treats local anti-Nazi resistance fighters in eastern nations as fascists and terrorists, executes/imprisons them

5) USSR does not liberate nations and bring back governments-in-exile but places their own puppet governments.  

6) USSR pretends to have fought to liberate Europe *while keeping the territory it took from Poland in '39*

These events helped form the Eastern-European mindset regarding the behavior and intentions of the USSR. 

**Then on to how I read your questions:**

1) Russian asks ""how can you claim to be oppressed when the USSR imposed regimes that committed mass surveillance, political imprisonment, torture, censorship, state propaganda, brutal military crackdowns on popular movements, martial law, food shortages, travel bans... since, you know, it was a bit worse over here?""

2) Russian asks ""why can't you forget that we committed mass murders on other nations, when we also did that to ourselves?"" Counterexample: Germany.

3) Russian asks ""how could anyone possibly compare totalitarian dictatorial regimes that both emphasize social cooperation to root out the weak, parasitic elements of society by using mass deportations, shootings, secret police, military conquest, cult of personality, punishment of arbitrary groupings of population (race/class, whatever), mass rape, production quotas, slave labor, sprawling internment camps etc etc??"".

&gt; 
 Seventeen members of the Eritrean national football team who vanished during a tournament in Uganda two years ago are living in the Dutch town of Gorinchem, the AD newspaper said on Saturday.
&gt; 
 The team went missing after going shopping ahead of returning home to Eritrea when they were knocked out in the early stages of the tournament.
&gt; 
 But only three went home. The rest went on to claim asylum in Uganda, which, according to the BBC, was granted them in 2013.
&gt;
 **Romania**
&gt; 
 According to the AD, they hung around Kampala for a while before making their way to Romania. From there they came to the Netherlands, ending up earlier this month in Gorinchem, a riverside town south east of Rotterdam.
&gt;
The town council was puzzled when confronted with an entire football team, the AD said. 'But the same rules apply to them as apply to every refugee,' spokeswoman Monique de Jongh told the paper. 'We are looking after them as we should do.'
&gt;
Arie van Hoven, of the local food bank, told the paper the group had a terrible journey to get here. 'They arrived with almost nothing. We've been looking for furniture and mattresses for them.'
&gt;
**Invitation**
&gt;
Gorinchem's mayor Anton Barske told RTL news the group are terrified that something may happen to their families and want to avoid publicity.
&gt;
He said the group was invited to the Netherlands by the Dutch government when they were in Romania and had already started learning Dutch while in the eastern European country.
&gt;
'They wanted to stay together as a group and that was possible here,' he said. 'They are going to integrate and need an education. Then they will be able to build a new life,' the mayor said.

true,G_Morgan,WALE,Wales,"&gt; Poles and Czechs and Lithuanians lived worse than the English and the French, but they still lived better than Russians. Eastern European goods were held in high esteem throughout the USSR. Every DDR citizen who has seen BRD wanted to live there, and every RSFSR citizen who has seen GDR wanted to live there. So the visceral reaction is ""how can you claim to be oppressed if you lived better than us""?

If I took from you the ability to feed your family and then gave you 60% of my food how would you feel? These nations didn't choose communism, communism chose them. Russia is to blame for the entire economic insanity that ruled that era. It cannot say ""we sacrificed the most to try and make up for the insanity we are imposing on you"" in response.

The Russian complaints only make sense if those nations joined willingly. They did not. They suffered inferior standards of living because Russia enforced upon them a system that demanded inferior standards of living. The fact Russia wasn't hypocritical and also suffered does not change this basic fact.

&gt; So, what do you think it will take to put the past behind us?

Surely that takes an end of the Russian status quo of invading its neighbours every 50 years? When will Russia stop invading neighbouring countries? If Wales was on the Baltic and England is where Ukraine is I'd be asking America for nukes and troops. I'd be asking for tax increases to pay for a larger army so nobody can say we were prepared to let others defend us.

When I go to France, Italy or Spain I speak English to the people there, because I speak neither French, Italian or Spanish. However, I don't speak Danish to them, because they obviously wouldn't understand that.  No one speaks Danish, really.

So I try to meet people halfway - I speak the foreign language that I consider you most likely to understand, and perhaps we can understand each other.

I generally feel like, when I do this in Spain or Italy, that people understand this gesture - I'm trying to do my best to communicate efficiently with you, and if you can, I would love to have a conversation with you in our shared second-language. So even if they can't speak English, it's not seen as an insult or as anything negative towards me or them.

However, I feel like French people are more inclined to be annoyed that I can't speak French, and not appreciate the fact that I really am trying to communicate with them in the best way that I can imagine. I can assure you, no matter how poor a French persons English might be, my French is worse.

Ein Zitat als Beispiel vom Brandenburger Innenminister Dietmar Woidke: 

&gt;Dennoch ist laut Woidke die Kriminalitätsbelastung in der Grenzregion mit etwa 224.000 Einwohnern überdurchschnittlich hoch. Bezogen auf 100.000 Einwohner wurden laut Ministerium 2012 rund 9150 Straftaten gezählt – etwa 1250 mehr als im Landesdurchschnitt.

The relation worsened starting with your current regime's open support of Transnistria and refusal to withdraw the 'peacekeeping' troops.

true,kalleluuja,ESTO,Estonia,"1, Estonia was better off than Finland before WW2. So, USSR most probably was a pretty awful thing for economy. And economy is not only numbers. It's the fact that our lands were occupied and foreign system imposed. 

Russia is quite butthurt for losing to US. Try being occupied for 50 years, then you know what bitter really tastes like.

2, I think almost every family here in Estonia suffered from deportations or straight forward executions. One third of the whole population suffered deportation, death or gulag.  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_deportations_from_Estonia

One of my grandparents was sent to work camp and most of the family was shot, just because they owned some land.  

3, Most common story from people who survived both occupation, nazis and communists, is that German soldiers were very polite and civil, but Russians were rude, violent and barbaric. 

One side of my grandparents are Estonians and the other is Russian speaking. And during German occupation my Russian grandmother was sent to work camp in Poland. She was sent there in normal humane conditions and she has no horror stories from the camp. But when Russians ""liberated"" her, she was put in overcrowded cattle car with no food and water. And on the way back to homeland a child in their car who cried for too long was shot by Russian soldier who was guarding them. My grandmother was teenage girl then, with her sister, and she still says that her sister was never the same again after that incident. 


And put all these points aside. I think that history itself is not what drives a lot of people towards anti-Russian sentiment. But it's the post-Soviet mentality of Russians and Russia. I think your post is a great example of it. Through some mental acrobatics and twisted moral you try make a victim out of yourself - which probably in your mind makes the crimes more or less okay. And I don't want to attack you personally. I just hear this line of thought you proposed quite often.  

I think Germany handled historic issues so well. Russia is nowhere close to realizing the issue and nowhere close even looking at the truth. In fact lately Putin is heading Russia in exactly opposite direction(with cultivation of ethnic nationalism and USSR greatness myth). It's kind of a shame. Because it will only widen the gap between Eastern Europeans and Russians. I think we are heading into some rocky ride in that sense.

Siesta means nap.

First of all, for eastern Europe victory over Germany was in fact a change from a bigger oppressor to a lesser - but still - oppressor. Those people wanted to live in their own countries, not in satelite countries with imposed governments or in Baltics case, as a part of the empire itself. Would a Russian like to live under, lets say, chinese government, hearing about how great China is all the time and that your previous, Russian government was a mistake of the history and only under chinese rule, you'll advance as a civilisation? I doubt.

Try to look from the eastern-european position. Most of them or their ancestors have never been to USSR in years when they had their soverign countries in 20's and 30's. What they were comparing was their experience and knowledge about life in their soverign countries and the experience gained under soviet occupation or under their 'brotherly' communist governments. And that new life, if we discount the general technical advancement of the world - was much worse. When they had their free countries, nobody was deported. There were no mass murders of thousands people whose only fault was that they were educated, the borders weren't closed, trade with the free world wasn't limited, the censhorship was way smaller and nobody imposed on them a new strange, alienic ideology. 

They also compared their lives with information that they received from western Europe, not so far away and when the years passed, and the eastern bloc went economically more and more backward, they had more reasons to hate the system that was imposed on them and therefore, hate the source of it.

Besides, there always has been a hidden fear of what cames from the east. First there were Mongols, then imperial Russia, then Bolshevicks (1920), then USSR. It's a geographic-political thing.

This argument only implies that Soviet regime was more anti-Russian than anti-Latvian or Anti-Estonian. Does it imply that Latvia and Estonia were not oppressed?

true,CreepyOctopus,LATV,Latvia | Sweden,"The key point is extremely simple - modern Russia still acts like the USSR was mostly an alright country with some flaws, and not a murderous dictatorship. I have no problem with most Russian people, or with Russia itself in general, I have a problem with current Russia, and with every aspect of the Russian government.

I of course don't like Nazi Germany, but I'm fine with modern Germany, like it a lot actually. The difference in this case is not because of what USSR or Germany did in the 40s, but of how they have developed since then.

The main thing modern Russia refuses to recognize or even entertain is that, for Eastern Europe, USSR was an invader, not a liberator. Soviets defeated one horrible invader but then remained as an occupying regime themselves. Personally, I think that, because of certain ideological aspects, Nazi evil was unparalleled, and so I think that Eastern Europe would have fared even worse under prolonged Nazi rule. Had Nazis won the war, they would have probably just killed a million Latvians in the next decade. Not to mention almost all Poles. But an invader is still an invader. If one regime kills, for instance, 13 million people while the other kills 5 million, it doesn't make the second regime the good guys, it makes them all monsters.

Another reason why it's very difficult for Russians to accept, culturally, that Soviets are seen as invaders is family ties. Nobody wants to think that their grandfather was a murderer or criminal, and not a hero who saved Europe. I am not saying that all Red Army soldiers were monsters. Not at all. But likewise, not all of them were Nazi-fighting heroes. The Soviet army did plenty of horrible things during the war, but this is not acknowledged very much. Some people on the Soviet side were as bad as anyone in the SS, but nobody wants to think their grandfather was one of those people. I understand the difficulty, and I'm amazed Germans are coping so well - they are the exception here, most countries are unable to really acknowledge the horrible things they've done in the past.

The main reason, though, why I can't like modern Russia at all is its attitude towards the Soviet Union. I would love it if you had a leader who came out and said that yes, the Soviet regime was horrible. That yes, the Soviet Union occupied some countries and forced others into communist dictatorships. That Stalin and Hitler have much more in common than different. Instead, you have Putin, who's set to rule the country for at least 10 more years, true Soviet-style longevity, who says that the collapse of the Soviet Union was a catastrophe, who says that Russia sacrificed its own lands when the USSR collapsed.",0,1399922483,null,0,false,0,chg6ddv,t3_25da2d,t1_chg6ddv,t3_25da2d,null,1433765391,52,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,52

after education, that might be different but if a higher percentage of your age group are graduating with degrees etc then there is an over saturation of  people in those careers paths.  this is what happens when certain careers are pushed to teenagers to boost university appeal and social respectability  after a dictatorship or major country or social crisis.

That's like telling a Russian to 'move on' after World War II. People tend to have long memories of shit foreign powers did to them. Sure Russians were oppressed during Communism - by *Russians*. Countries like Czechoslovakia and Hungary weren't oppressed without the help of foreign armies. This makes their oppression worse in the memory of Czechs, Slovaks, and Hungarians. 

It doesn't help that the Russian army had a particularly rape-y reputation during WWII, yet there seems to be a very ""Team Russia - FUCK YEAH"" attitude that Russians have regarding their role in the war. Yes, millions of Russians were sacrificed during that war, but if you don't at least acknowledge that Russians weren't exactly saints during that conflict, affected countries are going to hold a grudge.   

&gt;The equalization of Soviet rule and Nazi rule. This is something that cannot be comprehended by a Russian mind. . . So, what do you think it will take to put the past behind us?

Make every Russian visit [The House of Terror](http://www.terrorhaza.hu/en/index_2.html) in Budapest. Housed in a building that was once the headquarters of secret police, The House of Terror is a museum that was built to teach the public about the dangers of both Nazi and Soviet-lead tyranny. One major point that is explained in detail by the museum is how the Soviets used what was set up by the fascists to do what amounted to the same shit in different uniforms.

Also, you should stop being an echo chamber country. Certain countries (the US included) have such a long history of being big and powerful that the citizens often lapse into living in a bubble where all foreigners are inscrutable and meaningful dialog is often hampered by a nationalist-tinged circlejerk (""We gave them democracy - why could they possibly hate us?""). Think of it as living in a big, dysfunctional family that you don't realize is dysfunctional until you start hanging out at your friend's parents house. 

The only way to break out of this is for a critical mass of people to be curious about the outside world enough to do their own research while being critical of local media portrayals of the world at large. Good luck with that. ",0,1399922496,null,0,1399922764,0,chg6dmn,t3_25da2d,t1_chg6dmn,t3_25da2d,null,1433765395,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

--------------

But the biggest issue, the elephant in the room every politician talking about employement ignore blatantly : under employement, aka working poverty. It's when you ""work"" but still live in poverty because it's a ""shit"" and/or part time job paying little to nothing; that you can't survive on, and there's nothing else to switch to. so you keep working whatever you do for legal minimal wage because no one will pay you more for anything, at part time resulting in you ""working"" but getting really 800€/mo after taxes. That's how we lowered raw unemployement numbers without solving at all the job market or lack of income issue.

What's the average youth wage in EU for example ? and in the UK ? Spain ? France ?

To expand, it's of course way worse than a simple ""economic crisis"", and that's why we can't seem to get out of it, and why greece and spain and other areas modernizing and seeing how we could in fact all live (turkey, ukraine, arab springs, ...) keep blowing up at random times.

Sure we bailed out the banks and greek and spanish gov. *but for citizens, what does it change in the common day to day life ?*. oh yeah, austerity except for the rich enough to find new and creative tax loopholes. Life just keep getting harder for a lot of us. So,  is the crisis really over ?

-------------

I might be wrong and clearly lack hard data and proofs. But that's the feeling i get from a lot of people is that the gov meanwhile live in it's millions-of-euros-cash-protected bubble, totally disconnected. ""politiciens ? tous pourris"" ""there's no such thing as a politician that doesn't steal"". ""republican or democrats ? left or right ? two faces of the same coin, they're all colluding to steal everything anyway"" ""meet the new boss, same as the old boss"" '""let's vote for the lesser evil"". Don't tell me you never heard such talks constantly.

That's a society issue that will have to be adressed in the coming years if we don't want to see the entire EU ending up like greek or bosnian riots (quietly swoopt under the rug with ukraine) or maidan one of those day, honestly. Whether it's just a feeling to dispell (but be carefull about not spreading false info. propaganda doesn't catch as easily nowadays and lying could just worsen the opinion people have of politicians); or a serious wealth distribution issue/government ignoring real day to day issues like a lot of people are really starting to think it is. i keep having that bad feeling that lots of people are grumbling, and merely bidding their time waiting for the last straw to explode.",0,1399922714,null,0,1399923043,0,chg6hk8,t3_25bcoo,t1_chg6hk8,t1_chg49g3,null,1433765434,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

You wot?

edit: I feel like I need to go further into this. Belgians fully acknowledge what Leo did and that what he did was evil. 
Nobody wants that power back for the monarchs. Absolutely nobody.
As such we don't have any anti-leopold glorification laws or sentiment similar to Germany because there was never a big pro movement anyway. 

At best the government reacts apathetic as if he were merely a another face in the history books.
They just maintain him as a part of history and if he is even mentioned it isn't positive.

Additionally he wasn't the face of a national political movement like Stalin or Hitler were. Hell the actions in Congo had nothing to do with what the government decided. It think it's mainly seen as a mix of a dictatorship and a corporatocracy as he literally had concessionary companies own not only land but the people on them. He let them do their thing and they paid him taxes with the profits they gained from their horrendous exploitation.

Additionally we were never affected by it and as a result there are still a few places that carry his name for example. Sure that doesn't justify the apathetic stance towards it and we should probably do away with those but it does explain it. There's a reason his rule was taken down not by a riseup of the people or a war but by [international media action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State_propaganda_war#The_Downfall).

probably because the people who lived there *really had it way, way better* than the average dark age serf in europe. medieval europe was truly a dark, dungy shit hole for 99% of the pop (everyone that wasn't a noble). also nobody really forgot or excused the vikings, and scandinavia moved on since century. they never really invaded/raided anyone as of recent memory, unlike what russia is currently doing. 

Saying russia is OK despite invading several of it's neighbors recently just because the vikings did worse a millenia ago is just. well. ahah, a bit ridiculous.",0,1399924844,null,0,1399925510,0,chg7k2c,t3_25da2d,t1_chg7k2c,t1_chg4zj9,null,1433765938,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

Now, I do **NOT** apporve the murder of a citizen, regardless of what she might have done.

But...

- As the president of the province of León, her work was pretty irrelevant. Unlike the central government, the regional governments and the city councils, provinces have no real power, let alone in a small one like León (an increasing number of people -including some influential politicians and journaliasts- are asking to get rid of them). And yet, she earned more than the Prime Minsiter (twice as much if we consider her *13* jobs, most of them on the government).
  
- She was terribly nepotist. Her partner worked in a company that received a lot of public money, even though he didn't work there (he didn't have an office or a single computer there).
  
- She used taxpayers' money to go shopping on a luxury store or to pay for a beauty treatment, or her family's Christmas dinner (hint: they didn't eat at McDonalds)
  
- She threatened the leader of the opposition, and had no respect for people's sufferings. She even mocked at the people who were struggling.
  
- She repeteadly raised her salary, and that of her colleagues/friends/relatives, when the country was in the middle of the worst crisis since the civil war.

Is it bad/sad/shitty killing a politician? Obviously, yes, it is. But it's also really sad that a woman like this could work for so long after all the shit she'd done. This would not have happened if Justice had done their job.  

I'm not happy about a person being murdered, but, honestly, I'm not that sad.

true,MoreGott,,,"As your exam is tomorrow, I'll give this a try too... here we go.

Ich möchte über ~~den Begriff~~ „Mythen und Helden“ sprechen. Ein Mythos ist ein weit ~~angenommen~~ *verbreiteter*, aber falsch**er** Glaube ~~oder~~ *beziehungsweise eine falsche* Idee. Ein Held ist jemand, der Große**s** ~~Errungenschaften getan~~ *geleistet* hat und *dafür* ~~ist~~ bewundert *wird*. Im Unterricht haben wir gesehen, dass der Begriff „Held“ ~~können~~ viele Bedeutungen haben *kann'. ~~Deshalb können wir fragen, welche Dingen machen ein Held~~ *Was macht also einen Helden aus?* Ich werde ~~zwei Dokumente studieren~~ *für dieses Thema zwei Quellen nutzen*. ~~Das~~ Die erste ~~Dokument~~ ist ein Artikel *über Georg Elser* ~~von~~ *aus dem deutschen Magazin* **""**Der Spiegel**""** ~~über Georg Elser~~. ~~Das zweite Dokument~~ *Auch die zweite Quelle* ist ~~auch~~ ein Artikel. *Dieser befasst sich mit der* ~~über die~~ Bedeutung ~~den~~ *des* Begriff**s** „Held“ in Deutschland. (Did you mean in Germany or in German? If you meant in German, it would be *im Deutschen*)
Der erste Artikel ~~ist genannt~~ *mit dem Titel* „Allein gegen Hitler“ ~~und~~ erzählt Georg Elsers Geschichte. Elser war ein deutscher Möbeltischler. Er ~~ist~~ *wurde* berühmt**,** weil er ~~hat~~ versucht  *hat,* Hitler zu töten. ~~Dadurch diese~~ *Mit diesem* Attentat~~, Elser~~ wollte *Elser* de**n** Krieg ~~vermeiden~~ *verhindern*. ~~Der Artikel sagt, dass am 8. November 1939 hat eine Bombe explodiert, in München, im Bürgerbräukeller.~~

Version 1: Laut dem Artikel, explodierte Elsers Bombe am 8. November 1939 im Bürgerbräukeller in München.
Version 2: Laut dem Artikel, explodierte am 8. November 1939 eine Bombe im Bürgerbräukeller in München.

Unglücklicherweise *hatte* Hitler ~~hat schon verlassen der Ort~~ *den Bürgerbräukeller zum Zeitpunkt der Explosion bereits verlassen*. Elser hat**te* vorhergesagt, dass Hitler ein schlechter Mensch war, und~~,~~ dass er ~~würde~~ Deutschland ~~zum~~ *in einen* Krieg führen *werde* (maybe better: in einen Krieg stürzen werde).

~~Folglich~~ *Daher* hat**te** er ~~während eines vollen Jahrs des Attentat vorbereitet~~ *ein ganzes Jahr lang, ein Attentat auf ihn vorbereitet*. Er hat seine Bombe allein ~~gemach~~ *gebaut*, um niemand**en** *sonst* ~~zu gefährden~~ *in Gefahr zu bringen*. Nach de**m** gescheitert**en** Attentat, ~~der hat Leute~~ *mehrere Menschen verletzt oder getötet hatte* ~~getötet und verletzt~~, *wurde* Elser ~~war~~ in der Nähe ~~von~~ der Schweizer Grenze verhaftet. ~~Es ist nur am~~ *Erst gegen* Ende des Krieges~~, dass Elser~~ wurde *er* hingerichtet. ~~Wir~~ *Man* könnte~~n~~ erwarten, dass Elser nach de**m** Krieg ~~anerkannt wird~~ *Anerkennung fand*. Aber trotz seiner tapfer**en** Tat, wurde Elser nicht *etwa* gewürdigt, er wurde verfemt (verfemt is a nice old German word, I personally like it but maybe you should use a synonym like ""verachtet"", just saying). *Die* Leute dachte**n** ~~dass~~, es *sei* eine ~~falsche~~ *erfundene* Geschichte ~~war~~. Elsers Taten waren dennoch heroisch,weil ~~her hat~~ sein**e** Arbeit und *sein* Leben für ein höheres Ziel geopfert *hat*. Heutzutage*, nach über 70 Jahren wird* ~~ist~~ Elser**s** *Tat* ~~nach 70 Jahren~~ gewürdigt und bewundert. ~~Er hat so lange gedauerte vor Elsers~~ *Die* Anerkennung *Elsers dauerte so lange*, weil die Deutschen ~~will nicht mehr der Begriff „Held“ verwenden nach die Zweite Weltkrieg~~ *den Begriff des Helden seit dem Zweiten Weltkrieg nur noch ungern nutzen. Doch heute wissen die Menschen* ~~schließlich~~, dass Elser ein großer Deutscher war.
Der zweite Artikel ~~ist genannt~~ *trägt den Titel* „Die neuen deutschen Helden sind anders“. In diese**m** Text ~~ist es~~ *wird* erklärt, dass *sich* die Bedeutung de**s** ~~Begriff „Held“~~ *Heldenbegriffs* ~~hat ausordentlich geändert~~ im Laufe der Zeit *stark verändert hat*. ~~Zuerst,~~ **N**ach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg *schätzte man den* ~~war der~~ Begriff *des Helden in Deutschland* nicht ~~geschätzt in Deutschland. Es ist weil er war missbraucht~~ *Er wurde** während de**s** Krieg**es** *zu sehr missbraucht.* **Folglich** ~~hat er Tabu geworden~~ *wurde er zu einem Tabu*, wie ~~zeigt~~ der vorhergehend**e** Artikel *illustriert/zeigt*. ~~Jedoch, kann man heute wieder über Helden in Deutschland sprechen~~ *Heute kann man in Deutschland allerdings wieder von Helden sprechen.* ~~Heutzutage ist~~ **D**ie Bedeutung *ist heute jedoch eine andere, als noch* ~~anders als~~ vor dem Krieg. In der Vergangenheit *war* die Definition ~~für~~ ein**es** Held**en**, *dass* ~~war~~ jemand *dazu* fähig *war* sich zu opfern, jemand der *das* schützt**,** was er liebt. ~~Jedoch, nach~~ *Seit* dem Krieg wollen *die Deutschen* ~~Leute nicht mehr~~ diese Bedeutung *nicht mehr* benutzen, weil *deutsche* Soldaten ~~hat~~ angeblich ~~gestorben~~ *starben* wie Helden, ~~aber sie haben Verbrechen getan~~ *während sie in Wirklichkeit doch Verbrechen begingen*. ~~Jetzt~~ *Heute hat* der Begriff ~~hat~~ keine echte Bedeutung *mehr*. Helden sind heute Mitarbeiter, ~~oder~~ Sportler~~,~~ oder Künstler. Der übermäßige~~r~~ Gebrauch de**s** Wort**es** hat es nutzlos gemacht. Deshalb versuchen die Deutschen der Begriff zu aufwerfen (I don't understand that sentence. Do you mean, the Germans are trying to give the word a meaning again? Maybe like ""Deshalb versuchen die Deutschen den Begriff aufzuwerten""?)
Um ~~es zu machen~~ *dies zu erreichen, müssen* die Helden des Alltags ~~müssen~~ anerkannt werden. *Denn Personen* ~~weil Leute~~ wie Lehrer oder Ärzte helfen ~~eigentlich Leute~~ *Anderen*~~,~~ und kümmern sie sich nicht ~~mit~~ *um* Ruhm. ~~Der deutsche Held hat ganz geändert, aber jetzt sind die Deutschen nicht mehr unruhig mit der begriff Held, folglich kann der Held wieder bewundert sein.~~ *Die Bedeutung des Heldenbegriffs in Deutschland hat sich zwar vollkommen verändert, doch dadurch ist es den Deutschen nicht mehr unangenehm, den Begriff des Helden zu verwenden und sie können Helden wieder bewundern.*
~~Zum Schluss,~~ **I**n Deutschland *wurden und werden Helden* ~~hat~~ immer durch ihre Taten definiert ~~sein~~. Aber ~~Diese Taten haben nicht die gleichen geblieben~~ *die Taten, die jemanden zum Helden machen, sind nicht dieselben geblieben*. ~~Bevor, die Taten~~ *Vor dem Krieg* waren *es* heroisch**e** und tapfer**e** *Taten*, wie *die des* Georg Elser. ~~Jetzt die~~ *Heute sind es* Taten ~~muss~~ die **A**ndere**n** helfen~~,~~ und ~~ihre~~ *deren* Leben verbessern. In ~~einer bestimmten~~ *gewisser* Weise, ~~es~~ ist *es heute* leichter ein Held zu werden~~ heute~~, aber es ist eindeutig nicht weniger ehrenvoll.
