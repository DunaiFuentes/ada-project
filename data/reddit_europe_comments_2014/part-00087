EU tends to be far less regulated is false anyways. UK is the exception in Europe, and they are not even in the euro. Yet you base your whole argument on this one country. The one country that has followed specifically the US policy the most and implemented neo-liberal reform under Thatcher who was working hand in hand with Reagan. US is the country that began experimenting with neo-liberalism, and then they ""liberated"" countries by making them adopt the ideology. All the Bretton Woods organizations are created by the US and they control it. US is still the country today that is making others become more and more liberalized. Which countries banks come from today has little meaning. Banks dont have a nationality. They have shareholders from all around the world. 

And anyways, this discussion is not about who is more liberal between the US and the EU. Its about discussing why there are certain right wing (very fringe I should specify, these guys dont even have an official party) groups in Europe who are pro-Russia and anti- US. And I should also mention that these ""3rd way"" guys are not a fan of the politics of EU either btw.

1. C'est un job. Traite le comme un job. Si tu peux écris des petits rapports réguliers, imagine que t'est ingénieur et pas doctorant. Trouves des conférences moins bien si nécessaire, mais rédiger ça aide énormément pour faire un bilan, pour se rendre compte que tu as avancé, pour valoriser... pour te motiver. Vraiment, n'hésite pas. Et si tes papiers sont refusés, c'est pas grave. Sois pro-actif: prépare toi: tu les soumets pour documenter ton travail, pas pour valider ta valeur comme personne. Les retours, c'est utile! 
2. Tu n'es pas pire que les autres. Nous sommes tous nuls. Il y a des gens qui ont plus de chance que d'autres (sujet  et travail plus ou moins définis/clairs, encadrement efficace ou pas etc) mais tu trouveras que la vaste majorité souffre
3. Ça va finir bientôt. Imagine ce qui va venir après pour t'inspirer. The grass is always greener on other side, par contre donc ne te laisse pas séduire par l'""autre"", utilise le juste pour te motiver. Dis toi que cette thèse c'est un projet, une épreuve qui va montrer que quand on t'embauche et on te jette dans l'océan, toi, tu persistes, tu survis. Ce n'est pas ton expertise qui sera le résultat le plus important de cette thèse, c'est que t'as réussi avec si peu de support. 
4. Tout le monde est nul. Le doctorat n'est pas un test de valeur comme personne. Ne te mesure pas contre tous les experts. Prend le moins personnellement, c'est un boulot. Finis le et move on!

Ca peut faire bien dans les dîners, ce genre de phrases, mais sinon ça serait pas mal de se poser la question du pourquoi. Pourquoi les gens sentent le besoin de se tourner vers des alternatives ? Quand il est question de santé et qu'on est malade on est prêt à tout, même avoir recours au surnaturel. On est là sur ce sub à se branler en s'imaginant que les gens sont complètement cons et que c'est pour ça qu'ils choisissent des pierres magiques à se fourrer dans le fion plutôt que d'aller chez un toubib. C'est facile de s'en moquer quand on est dans un état de lucidité total car non sous l'emprise de la douleur et de la peur.

Est-ce que l'attirance pour ces alternatives qui n'apportent pas de solutions ne serait pas la marque de l'échec de la pratique de la médecine ""vraie"" ? Notez que je parle de l'échec de la pratique, non pas de la science elle-même. Je me demande si les gens qui se tournent vers les alternatives ne sont pas tout simplement des personnes qui en ont marre de se faire promener d'un toubib à un autre pour se faire refiler des pastilles qui ne servent à rien et entendre 20 diagnostics différents et de voir que les médecins ne se sentent pas concernés par leur problème de santé.

Je ne sais pas. Je n'ai pas la réponse et je ne pense pas que tous les médecins sont des escrocs et que les pratiques alternatives apportent de réelles solutions, mais force est de constater que la médecine mainstream prend de plus en plus l'allure d'un business comme un autre et que le patient est avant tout client.

Però la questione è interessante: se accettiamo come non immorale il prestito con interesse, non è banale dire che fino a interesse X va bene e dopo no. Di per sé, il tuo ragionamento è abbastanza valido.

Le ragioni per cui l'usura è reato però non sono che qualcuno ha tirato una linea a caso.

Ci sono due ragioni molto importanti. La prima è la soglia concettuale della ""circonvenzione d'incapace"" o altro comportamento tipo ""tu devi mangiare la prossima settimana e l'unico che ti può dare i soldi sono io"". In questi casi c'è un chiaro abuso di una persona che non ha la capacità di farci nulla, ed è costretta a fare il prestito. La seconda è che usura = mafia; i soldi dell'usura al 100% finiscono in associazioni a delinquere, e al 100% questo reato è collegato con altri reati più violenti (intimidazioni). Viene attaccata l'usura per attaccare cosa c'è dietro.

Yes, it is partly pride. I am too proud to go on benefits unless I had to. If I became incapacitated from work and no longer had savings then I would go on benefits. But for me it would be a last resort. Just losing my job would not be enough. 

It is also a political conviction. I don't believe that others should pay taxes to give me benefits when I am (a) wealthy because I have savings and (b) could easily get a job to clean toilets.

&gt; presumably as a lawyer you pay tax and national insurance.. you're fully entitled to claim when you're out of work, that is literally what jsa is for.

I do pay tax and national insurance. But, I don't believe that people should claim benefits if they don't need them. I actually was out of work for a while a few years back and I didn't claim benefits. I lived off savings. Also, during that time I could have got a job to clean toilets (had I needed to or wanted to). Given that I technically did not need benefits I don't think it would have been right to take them.

edit: To all those reading. If you find yourself unemployed from a high end job, don't settle for menial work if you don't have to. Get as much social help as you possibly can and use the time to find another job like it or build up experience through volunteering or independent projects . Low end work will leave you too drained, will not qualify you for anything in the future, and the hours, either long or unpredictable, will not give you any time to search for anything better.

I haven't given advice here so far. I am describing what I think legislation should be (and how I behave myself).

&gt; If you spend a long time employed away from your chosen field, especially if you're just starting, you decrease the chances of rejoining it.

That's true. But that doesn't mean that you should accept benefits, rather than living off savings, living with parents or doing another job. You need to weigh up a range of factors.

&gt; Also you seem to be severely underestimating the physical and psychological toll that a menial job can have, and how the pressure to work a lot of hours to pay rent keeps you in a poverty trap, where escape is difficult.

My friend's grandma is a Ukrainian Jew. Something similar happened to her but she ended up at a concentration camp. She witnessed her newborn baby sister get shot by Nazi soldiers. Her and her family escaped and lived in the wilderness for several years. There are many holes in the story but he doesn't want to ask her about it to fill them in. Several of my other friends' family members were subject to horrible Soviet policies (like the one's your describing too).

Last story. My cousins found out their Polish heritage is actually split between Polish and Russian Jewish. Their great grandfather fled the USSR to Poland. My cousins' dad was at a hardware store, and the clerk noticed his last name. He said, ""ah, [Russian pronunciation of name]"". Their dad corrected him and was on his way. The clerk was Polish and must have noticed a popular change people made to make their Russian-Jewish names Polish. 

The funny thing is this random store clerk knew years before their dad and his family of their actual heritage. They didn't find out until their great grandfather passed away. For two generations they thought that side of the family was 100% Polish. It wasn't until they were going through his stuff, and found his Russian passport tucked away, that they found out the truth.

________________________

Wie /u/Maxrockt schon sagte, ist die Behauptung Mensch=Tier in der Philosophie so nicht haltbar.

Wenn ihr nämlich jetzt **Instinkte** wie

&gt;Behausungen bauen, andere Tiere für sich nutzen, ""Wissen über Generationen hinweg weitergeben""

mit menschlichem Verhalten zu **Selbstreflektion**, **Vernunft** und seinem **freiem Willen** usw gleichsetzt, dann ist das einfach nur DUMM.

Der Mensch besitzt diese Instinkte selbsverständlich auch, weil sie seinem tierischen Anteil angehören, deshalb ist dort auch nicht der Unterschied zwischen Mensch und Tier, der den Menschen höher stellen soll zu verorten.

Der Unterschied liegt maßgeblich in der menschlichen Vernunft, der Fähigeit zu Selbstreflektion und dem Freien Willen.


Man kann ja jetzt auch noch gerne groß und breit philosophisch über die Einschränkung der Vorhandenseinsgrade von Instinkten bei Tieren und Freiem Willen beim Menschen auslassen (-&gt; Grenzfälle, bzw Übergängsfälle wie Delfine/Gorillas), aber das Endergebnis bleibt dasselbe:

Die Gleichung *Mensch=Tier* ist philosophisch betrachtet **nicht** richtig und **nicht haltbar**.

I am not from one of the countries in question, but I would argue even more importantly would be acknowledging it was wrong through actions. Like not sanctioning countries for deciding they'd rather be closer to the EU. Not doing everything in its power to keep a natural gas monopoly to have considerable political influence (Russia/Gazprom petitioned the EU to block the LNG import hub in Lithuania on the grounds it was ""unfair competition""). Gazprom has a 100% monopoly on natural gas there, yet somehow that is ""fair"". 

I am certainly not saying Russia is the only country that tries to influence the decisions of other nations, but given the historical relationship between the USSR and former bloc nations, it makes attempts to guide ex-bloc nations' political course all that much more offensive to the citizens there.

There is a lot of strategy involved in the current job market, for which pride cannot take account of.

Jo, hab ich weiter untern auch nochmal so prägnant klargestellt. (Dachte ich käme mit oberfächlicher Redart rum und dachte nicht, dass jetzt auf die Weise wieder eine absurde Metadiskussion entsteht)

&gt; Man muss aber dazu sagen, dass die Unterteilung schwierig ist, wie alle Kategorisierungen. Sie ist jedoch nötig. Es gibt ja durchaus Menschen, entweder in gewissen Lebensstadien (Babys, Alzheimer im fortgeschrittenen Stadium), oder aber auch während ihres ganzen Lebens (schwer geistig behinderte), die tatsächlich weniger ""schlau"" sind als Delphine oder Menschenaffen.

Korrekt, was mir wichtig war, war die **Tendenz**. Ein gesunder Mensch hat nunmal kognitive Qualitäten, die ein Tier nicht hat. Das ist eine logische Konsequenz der höher entwickelten Intellegenz des Menschen. Daraus leiten sich natürlich mit fortschreitender Intelligenz bei Tieren (Delfine/Gorillas) auch wieder Übergangsformen zum Menschen ab.

&gt;Ich halte das für nicht richtig: Wir sollten alle Wesen der Gattung Mensch gleichbehandeln.

Der Meinung bin Ich selbstverständlich auch.

(Es war auch keinesfalls meine Intention eine ""Dumm/Intelligent""-Hierarchie zu implizieren, um den Gedankengang mal auf diese Idee runter zu brechen.)

&gt;Über den Tierschutz gilt es gesondert zu diskutieren. Ebenso über die Frage, ob Delphine vielleicht doch zur selben Kategorie gehören wie wir - was schwierig zu klären ist, so lange wir nicht mit ihnen kommunizieren können.

Ah, like the old/dying crowd in the US. They make claims about socialized healthcare, but miss one glaring fact. They are *all* using socialized health care. Medicare is a federal program that automatically covers every person when they turn 65. It is not some obscure program, it is the largest insurer in the US. So socialized healthcare is only evil if it doesn't benefit *them*. Also, Italy already has universal healthcare, no?

Obama does promote green energy, but ""bureaucracy"" is difficult argument coming from any politician in Italy. He is actually promoting removing bureaucratic hurdles businesses face. He is championing a Federal program that will promote new technology in 45 cities. Chicago's $300 million high tech manufacturing hub was just announced. I know your PM has talked fairly extensively about removing hurdles for businesses, but I read how many Italian politicians will likely fight the changes because the current setup is very beneficial to them.

He does strongly support marriage equality and the right to chose, but I think that is fairly commonplace in most Western countries. Its funny they would target him instead of their EU partners. France and the England/Wales legalized it last year.

I understand you are not one of these people, and are clearly not making these arguments. But anyone with half a brain can discredit half of what they're saying with little or no research at all. It is pretty ridiculous they have any support.

I'm a law graduate myself, not a STEM graduate. I'm not really talking about what enhances a CV, I'm more talking about what legislation should look like. I also think that society benefits as a whole if more people have experience of menial work.

&gt; The poverty trap is real you see. Currently the welfare system has a failure gap at about 10k pounds a year for a single person, where without any social help you're pretty much stuck. 

That is why it is so important that people on benefits should NOT earn more than people in work. People should be incentivised to work, not stay on benefits.

People are largely better off seeking stable,good employment if they can rather than immediately clawing for jobs which pay so little and give you so little time that they keep you dependent on them on a monthly basis.

I've done jobs with zero hours contracts in the past and found them incredibly helpful. In fact, earning money for me while I was doing my A-levels and degree would have been very difficult without a zero-hours contract as (because of my studies) I did not want to commit to fixed hours but preferred a lot of flexibility. I can see myself taking a zero hours job in the future if it suited my circumstances and if I was looking for work. I know many people who have circumstances which suit zero hours contracts.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"It really depends on the state. In the North you're much more likely to find mandatory union membership for certain professions. I believe in a fair wage, but sometimes unions can get out of hand. I worked for a multinational telecom company. I worked in the finance department. The union went on strike, so finance people were out doing line work and working on customer installations. This was only after a few weeks of training. During this entire time they were receiving threats from union members, including some physical confrontations. 

These finance people (and other professionals) all had 4 year degrees, and many of them had masters degrees as well. Yet the union members often made more money. I could not complain at all about how that company treated us (and we were non-union). The benefits were incredible. My $1,000,000 life insurance policy was $5 per month (they paid the rest), they gave you $8,000 per year for education expenses. My health insurance (excellent) was $80 per month, they paid the rest. I had one month of vacation. The salary was fair. I was not loaded, but I could afford to live by myself in Chicago in a nice neighborhood, and own a new car in the city (which is a luxury). I was 24 at the time and still attending university so the education benefit helped. 

The union members' benefits were even better, and they complained more. I am not saying all union members are like this, but I was absolutely disgusted by how entitled they were acting. It was like watching a spoiled child throw a tantrum in a candy store when he was finally told ""no"". Their division of the company was losing substantial amounts of money, yet they thought they deserved to be treated better than everyone else. 

They were protesting ""corporate greed"" talking about the money the company made. What they were leaving out is that was due to the other divisions that did not rely on them. Their division was a money sinkhole, and generated substantial losses. 

If someone can be replaced by someone with two weeks of training they're not indispensable. As I said I am completely for a fair wage, but most wages were stagnant during the recession, but these guys negotiated an 8% increase over 3 years IIRC. During the recession, before this increase, the average salary *not including* benefits was $60-80,000 per year. With overtime it easily can get into the 6 figures.

So dont think the US is some utopia. And this was just my personal experience with one union, so dont take it as gospel. It did seriously piss me off considering we were treated well, and they were treated better, yet they completely drug the company though the mud.

Difendere il proprio orticello appoggiando (implicitamente ed esplicitamente) quelli che lo fanno con le truffette, la xenofobia e sogni deliranti di secessione, è una puttanta sesquipedale, per me.

I don't believe in conspiracies, so I don't believe this is in any way condoned by NATO. I can even imagine this leak immediately triggered angry phone calls from NATO head quarters. But I do think the Turkish government knows they occupy an extremely powerful strategic position, since they are the only ones that can block the Black Sea if military escalation in Ukraine calls for it.

Guardando la concorrenza quello che è più inattaccabile e che si è creato una sua nicchia, per la quale ha anche paradossalmente poco bisogno di pubblicità, è il tonno Consorcio. Che ormai è conosciuto come il tonno in scatola più buono di tutti (si parla sempre di prodotti da supermercato), e quindi può ritagliarsi una sua fascia di prezzo e una sua clientela.
Per tutti gli altri bisognava solo dimostrare che il tuo è migliore dell'altro.

E se consideri che in pubblicità tu non devi vendere il prodotto, ma devi vendere l'idea, lo stile di vita, la filosofia che c'è intorno al prodotto, capisci che la qualità è paradossalmente un tema secondario.",0,1395950623,null,0,false,0,cgdjbdm,t3_21cw54,t1_cgdjbdm,t1_cgdip9x,null,1433096616,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

true,Plantaquatix,YAFrance,France,"&gt; Non, franchement on est assez performant là. On guérit des pathologies qu'on espérait même pas traiter il y a quelques décennies et la réactivité est assez importante.

Je m'interroge plus sur des cas qu'on imagine maîtriser mais qui au final se terminent par l'abandon du patient. Un mec a mal au dos, va chez le toubib, il lui prescrit des antidouleurs et un décontractant. Le gars revient deux à quatre semaines plus tard car la prescription du docteur n'a rien fait. Le médecin décide alors d'envoyer le patient dans un centre d'imageries. Les images sont prises et les résultats sont communiqués au médecin et au patient. ""On voit rien sur vos radios, IRM, etc., monsieur. Vous n'avez rien."" Que fait le patient, sachant qu'il a toujours mal ? S'il en veut vraiment il va tenter un nouveau toubib et peut-être une nouvelle batterie de tests. Toujours rien, qu'on lui dit. Mais le pauvre type souffre le martyr au quotidien. Il a tenté deux toubibs, s'est pris des radiations dans la tronche, ça fait maintenant deux à trois mois que ça dure, l'histoire. Personne ne peut rien pour lui puisqu'Il n'a officiellement rien. Et l'histoire s'arrête-là pour les médecins. Pourtant notre type a toujours mal, donc il commence à demander à Google ce qu'il en pense. Il se dit que c'est ridicule mais il va quand même sur aufeminin.com et doctissimo.fr pour lire les conseils d'autres ""hypocondriaques"". Untel lui dit que l'ostéopathie est la réponse à son problème, Machin lui dit que l'homéopathie y a que ça de vrai, sur quoi Bidule surenchérit en ne jurant que par l'acupuncture et les infusions à la lavande. Notre mec n'y croit pas plus que ça mais au final la médecine ""traditionnelle"" lui a clairement fait comprendre qu'elle ne pouvait rien pour lui. Il essaye tout ça, sans succès, jusqu'au jour où, après avoir abandonné tout espoir, alors qu'il sortait de la Fistinière il a nettement moins mal au dos, peut-être parce qu'Il a bien plus mal ailleurs. Deux ans se sont écoulés depuis le début de sa douleur mais là ça va mieux. Il va s'empresser d'aller partager son expérience sur tous les forums de santé en ligne. Objet : le fist, ce remède contre les maux de dos. Les tenanciers de la Fistinière tombent un jour sur ce billet et se disent que c'est une véritable aubaine. Ils renomment leur établissement ""clinique de la Fistinière"" histoire d'asseoir (aïe) leur nouvelle réputation. La boucle est bouclée.

Ce que j'essaie de dire c'est qu'il existe des pathologies extrêmement communes que le corps médical semble balayer de la main en disant ""c'est dans la tête, il ne peut en être autrement car vos examens sont normaux"". Or la douleur physique est bien là. Le pauvre gars dans mon exemple il a vraiment fait confiance aux médecins en premier lieu, pensant qu'il allait être accompagné dans sa démarche. Mais au final il a dû faire le boulot lui-même : remettre en question les résultats, demander un deuxième avis, etc. Et plus il passe du temps à trouver comment s'en sortir, plus il se focalise sur sa douleur. Ce type une fois les examens confirmés n'a pas été suivi, on ne lui a pas offert de prise en charge valable. Du coup il s'est mis à chercher tout seul des options alternatives. Et c'est là que les professions pseudo-médicales s'engouffrent, car il y a du pognon à se faire quand on prodigue un peu d'espoir. Mais si on avait pris le temps de trouver ce qui clochait chez le patient dès le départ, si les médecins avaient fait de son problème le leur, il n'aurait peut-être pas posté son billet sur un forum ""médical"" et personne après n'aurait tenté l'aventure d'aller se faire élargir l'hémisphère sud à des fins thérapeutiques.",0,1395950940,null,0,1395951584,0,cgdjhdp,t3_21i5xa,t1_cgdjhdp,t1_cgdfyct,null,1433096696,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

As I think that individual's are not equal to their religious/national/ethnic group, we are influenced by the society we grow up in, and we in turn participate in its construction. Also, I agree that one should not go to Serbia and be like ""you're all bad"" - I'd like to overcome that. But as long as we use nationality as a category to describe people and identify ourselves, there will be an out-group description/association with the group as a whole as people reduce complexity by doing so.

We all know it's not going to happen, so why bother? It'd be great if it did, but we should be realistic.

Realistically, Erdogan pushed with the EU agenda because it gave him the opportunity to clean out the military from his enemies, under pretext of making the country more democratic. That's been done, the military is castrated, the EU candidature means nothing to him now.

As for his Islamic leanings, people voted for his policies. He managed to outperform previous governments (mostly through shady dealings and cheap loans), and people for the first time felt like the country was going to be a regional power. That's it. To be honest, at this point, I don't even believe he's truly one to want an Islamic country. I feel more and more like religion was a card he played for the past 20 years to win votes in the East.

They speak Finnish in Swedish Lapland as well, so it hasn't vanished even in Sweden. If Österland had stayed part of Sweden, many things would have been different. Sweden might have turned officially bilingual, for example. It's worth noting that Finland only became bilingual in the first decade of 20th century, around the same time as voting franchise was expanded. You simply couldn't keep Swedish as the only language when people were expected to take part in politics. 

Sweden that would have entered the 20th century with Österland would have had similar problem. You couldn't have given such a huge minority voting rights without making language a minority question. Finnish speaking population of 1900 would have been around 2,2 million and Swedish speaking population would have been around 5,4 million. That's about 30% of the whole population who would have voted right about anybody who promised the chance to interact with government with their own language. If the topic would have been repressed, it would undoubtedly have caused a civil war (as the language question would have in Österland correlated heavily with class - the less educated people would have been working in the agrarian and industrial sectors as workers, making this an excellent topic for red agitators). 

Around that time counties would still have educated people only to the minimum amount needed. Teaching every kid Swedish would have been a huge investment and probably monetarily a rather stupid one. If you lived in, say Tammerfors or Kajana, you could have travelled hundreds of kilometres to any direction without encountering a Swedish speaker. Why would the county spend thousands upon thousands of crowns to educate people who only needed to be able to read instructions and perhaps write the occasional note?

The reason why for example LibreOffice can't replace Office isn't because it can't open Office documents 100% accurately, hell even Office can't open 100% accurately files created in different Office version, the reason is because the UI and functionality are missing. 

The problem you are describing is exactly about missing open standards. What you are expecting is that Open-/LibreOffice is copying MSOffice, which it can't since the specifications are only known to Microsoft. That OpenOffice can open MS documents as well as it does is a miracle, because much of it was guess work.

The bigger issue, the elephant in the room so to say, is that people are accepting MS products as the defacto standard and expect other software to copy its functionality, at all.

There are more than enough Linux programs that provide functionality similar to Active Directory/Exchange/MSOffice, but none of them works identical to the Microsoft versions and none is quite usable as a drop-in-replacement.

Open document standards are very important in the long term, only then you can have real competition in the field.

Turkey is just too damn important. It's geopolitics at its most cynical.

This was the main complaint I heard by Kurds in Eastern Turkey. I was there last winter. They were complaining about how since the EU gets such vital things, mainly energy, through Turkey most of their problems are ignored. 

I was talking to someone about what he thought of Turkey joining the EU, and he said, (from memory):

&gt;Look out the window, the Kurdish parts of Turkey are a third world country, and a police state. There is no economic development, half the time we dont even have electricity. How things are right now works for everyone. Europe gets its energy, and Turkey can still operate a police state out east and economically oppress us.

&gt;The European Union has a history of doing nothing for us, and we dont expect to ever get anything from them. They were willing to ignore the human rights abuses against Kurds out of fear of upsetting Turkey for so long why would we assume they would change. 

In my time there I heard nothing but cynicism when I asked people about the EU. They were upset with most Western powers, but mostly the EU because of its trade relationships with Turkey and their perceived (or actual) ability to put pressure on Turkey to change. 

The Kurds in Iraq had similar stories, just a different cause. Often theirs involved more violence. Completely crazy part of the world. ",0,1395956562,null,0,false,0,cgdmcnb,t3_21iowr,t1_cgdmcnb,t1_cgdisly,null,1433098109,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

Edit: I've read several articles about this and I still don't understand it. If you come to Germany, and you can't find a job, you could be expelled? My guess is they want to stop people from claiming benefits. So why don't they just cut off your benefits?

My guess, again, is that under German law, it would be illegal to cut off benefits to people in need. So they think it's easier to force them to leave the country.

It inspired William Wordsworth and many other poets. It includes the highest land in England, and also, by car, is quite close to Hadrians Wall as well.

It is just full of small villages, hills, ""mountains"" (not really, but by England standards) and lakes, and it is really nice.

Of course this is the North West of England, so you get a lot of rain, and also because it's a very popular tourist destination there are parts you best avoid (especially on certain days of the year, e.g Bank Holidays) but it's quite a largish area, so you will usually find many nice, secluded walks.

True, but 99% all European languages are related within the Proto-Indo-European tree, so with Swedish it goes without saying. It's however often described as a Germanic language, with close relations with Norwegian and Danish, and also Icelandic through the common root in Old Norse.

Finnish, Estonian, Sámi and Hungarian are exception in that regard in that they *aren't* related to Persian, Czech, Turkish, French, German, Swedish, Greek or any languages on the European continent, also including west- and central south Asia... (besides a few loans)

Hungarian however has a large vocabulary of loanwords, non-related to the Finnish and Estonian vocabularies, due to other influences over time, so the relationship is probably quite distant for anyone except theoretical linguistics.

true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"&gt; woher weißt Du das denn? Nur weil ich von den Empfindungen eines Orcas kaum was mitkrieg

Ein meinen angesprochenen Grenzfälle nahe stehendes Fallbeispiel ist argumentativ geschickt, ändert aber nichts an den Tatsachen:

Erstens brauchen wir nicht über die Intelligenz zu reden, der Mensch ist intelligenter als jedes bekannte Lebewesen. Damit geht die menschliche ""Vernunft"" und Reflektionsfähigkeit und bedingt auch die Empfindungsfähigkeit, bzw deren Dimension einher.

Mir war die Kontroversität der Nennung des empfindungsfähigeren Menschen durchaus klar, doch Ich wollte das trotzdem reinnehmen.

Letztendlich wird man den Empfindungsgrad **nie** absolut beziffern können, man kann aber anhand von Indizien unter Empfindungsgraden und -ebenen bei verschiedenen Tierarten unterscheiden. Man kann bei Tieren mehr oder weniger aufwändig an ihrem Verhalten in Versuchen erkennen ob, was und wie sie etwas empfinden. Die ganze Sache lässt sich also schon experimentell etwas einengen:

* http://www.fu-berlin.de/presse/publikationen/fundiert/2008_01/08_01_puppe/index.html

* http://www.focus.de/wissen/weltraum/odenwalds_universum/odenwalds-universum-fuehlen-tiere-so-wie-menschen_aid_355505.html

* https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bewusstsein

Man kann also (auch schon alleine durch die unterschiedl. Vorraussetzung: der Höherentwicklung des menschl. Gehirns) die Tendenz festellen, dass Menschen 1)je nach Vergleichstierart viel intelligenter sind, 2)eine sehr viel höhere und reflektiertere Empfindungsebene haben (-&gt;Unterschied Emotion/Gefühl?).

Um es auf zwei einfache, synthetische Aussagen runterzubrechen:

&gt;„Es gibt keine Eigenschaft des Menschen“, konstatiert der Zoologie-Professor Norbert Sachser von der Universität Münster, „die nicht als Vorform schon bei Tieren angelegt wäre“.

Darauf nun die implizierte Aussage folgend, dass der Mensch durch sein weiterentwickeltes Gehirn zu einer komplexeren Bewusstseinsebene und damit einem Ausbau aller tierischen Merkmale fähig ist, bishin zur Bildung von ""Alleinstellungs""merkmalen.

thank you very much for your fast mail. I have a further question, regarding Heinrich Fick, born 14.3.1835. You wrote he was born in Sidlin. Did you mean Siblin maybe? Siblin belongs to Ahrensbök. In this case I could research over here [*not sure if she meant in their museums archive or elsewehere*]. 
I'll call the church office next week to get informations [*hard to to translate directly, she'll try to get informations there*] regarding Heinrich Fick from Ahrensbök. 

Please check the town name Siblin or Sidlin again. This is important, else we would search in the wrong direction. Only then we can help.

In Bad Malente you would have to contact the *Standesamt* [register office] of the municipal administration (regarding Bernhard Fick). The address: 

Gemeindeverwaltung, Rathaus

23714 Bad Malente-Gremsmühlen, 

Bahnhofstr.31

phone: 0-04523-9920-0  [+ the code for germany]

e-mail: malente@landsh.de


Very kind regards from the distant Ahrensbök in Schleswig-Holstein.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I'm not a professional translator, but I think it's ok. 

About the town, Google Maps can't find Sidlin anywhere. So it's most likely a mistake and the name is indeed Si**b**lin, which belongs to Ahrensbök.

If you need someone to translate in the future but no one is answering here fast enough, you can try /r/translator/. Or maybe /r/LANL_German/, /r/Germany/, or /r/de/, if you ask politely.^^

For the future, there's a [regional church archive which stores the books from Malente *and* Ahrensbök. (but it costs a fee)](http://www.kirchenkreis-ostholstein.de/kirchenkreis/verwaltung/archive-des-kirchenkreises.html)
I don't know if she's going to call the local church office or the church archive in Gleschendorf, but you'll see. :)

You can respond to me in this topic again if you have a question, but I don't know how fast I'll answer since I'm not that often on reddit (this being my second account, forget the password of the first one :P).


Best of luck to you!  I hope you'll get further with your new informations. :)

true,zoozooz,null,null,"&gt; A dog can not give informed consent to sex, therefore all sex with animals for human satisfaction is rape.

You do realize that being *technically* right doesn't really mean you're morally right? What is *rape* supposed to mean when (hypothetical scenario:) a male dog is horny and aggressively seeking sex and happens to find the nearest human as a partner, pushes the human over and puts his penis inside the human? The dog ""is being raped""?

How about you find some concept for when sex is okay and when it is not okay, that is *applicable*? On wikipedia you find such weird concepts like

&gt; Hickman and Muehlenhard state that consent should be ""free verbal or nonverbal communication of a feeling of willingness’ to engage in sexual activity"" [7]

If you insist on the other hand of requiring spoken consent or whatever, then how do dogs not rape each other on every single mating? Do you happen to have a line of reasoning to separate this?

&gt; On the internet, several Danish animal owners openly advertise their services. The newspaper contacted several such individuals and was told that many of the animals have been engaged in this kind of activity for several years and that the animals crave the sexual stimulation. The newspaper found that the cost charged by the animal owners varied from DKK 500 to 1,000 (USD$85 to $170).

Yea, first, I call bullshit. Second, yes, I would agree that this will in many cases lead to the animals suffering. I also agree that there are quite some people who get sexual pleasure from torturing animals. But that's not the issue you started discussing here, is it? You see it time and time again: People call for forbidding all human/nonhuman animal sex and then they use pictures of obviously abused dogs. Like the first thing here I found when I googled this paragraph: https://selfuni.wordpress.com/2014/02/24/animal-brothels-are-popular-in-germany-and-scandinavia/ But most often they fail to recognize that what they are showing here **is already forbidden** under animal abuse/cruelty laws.",0,1395963536,null,0,false,0,cgdpkjh,t3_2134ej,t1_cgdpkjh,t1_cg9r2tq,null,1433099625,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
true,postmoderno,no-borders,,"&gt; Lo spot televisivo, della durata di 45 secondi, si articola sulla contrapposizione tra il simbolo del Millennium Bug, un loghetto caratterizzante l’intera campagna comunicativa, ed un attore non testimonial (per agevolare l’autoidentificazione da parte del cittadino comune). L’ ambiente è costituito da una stanza nuda, salvo la presenza di un computer, dal cui schermo balza fuori improvvisamente il Bug, che inizia a svolazzare qua e là, sporcando con chiazze colorate le pareti bianche. L’attore spiega : “Ecco che salta fuori il Millennium Bug, un invitato indesiderato alla nostra festa di Capodanno del 2000. Millennium Bug: l’errore di quei computer che nel passaggio al 2000 non riconoscono il cambio di data, provocando equivoci e, forse, disagi. Inconvenienti che possono accadere nella nostra vita, nei sistemi e nei servizi che utilizziamo ogni giorno… Tranquilli, in fondo è solo un baco!”
L’attore mostra intanto come oggetti di quotidiano utilizzo, quali tessere magnetiche e telefoni cellulari, resistano tranquillamente agli attacchi del Bug, e mostra come sia facile cancellare le macchie lasciate dallo stesso, mentre una voce istituzionale fuori campo recita “Amministrazioni e imprese hanno lavorato per ridurre al minimo gli inconvenienti e garantire la continuità di tutti i servizi ai cittadini.

The author is not an anti-China idealist. Quite the contrary, he lived there for many years and was a consultant helping companies outsource there. You really get an inside look at what it takes to keep factories compliant there. It is a constant struggle and almost impossible to do forever. Everything is shrouded in secrecy and there is collusion between large business owners, that tend to be related.

One of nearly countless examples in the book is having a consumer product approved for sale in the US. Chinese labs are seen as being susceptible to corruption, so samples are sent to Hong Kong for testing. Out of 13 samples, one passed. The results were sent back to the factory, and the one report showing the product passed was sent and passed off as if it was the only sample submitted. 

I think companies are more careful now, and probably dont rely on companies in China to administer the testing process, but the trust that exists between two Western companies, even across borders, does not exist in that market.

Compulsory education developed in the 18th and 19th century (earlier in some regions), with the caveat that enforcement was only really possible in the 20th century. The goal was to get children educated, early resistance focused on the fact that sending children to school meant that they wouldn't be working. Most German states had made school education compulsory in the first half of the 19th century, for all of Germany it was codified in the Weimar constitution in 1919.

true,Titanomakhia,ENGL,England,"Libya was carried out with lots of US support planes but France ran by far the largest number of strikes (35%). EU countries together spent about double the amount of money the US spent in Libya. The US was the single biggest actor on a nation state level but considering the EU together more action, money and time was spent in Libya by Europe than the US; rightly so given it's proximity to the EU. 

I think were talking at cross purposes - the US does not subsidise European defence by actually defending Europe. Each countries navy and airforce at least in Western Europe does that themselves. Eastern Europe is a totally different story but this article is specifically about the richer countries cutting their budgets. If you consider pumping money into NATO defending Europe then we mean very different things because NATO's protection is only worth anything to European citizens in the event of a war to defend Europe - until then it's entirely speculative whether the money is spent to defend Europe or to engage in dick-swinging contests with Russia and in the middle east which is what it's been used for for most of the last 10 years since 9/11. 

NATO is half the reason Putin is grabbing land in Europe because if he didn't, NATO would - NATO has reneged on most of the promises made to Russia and proved willing to take NATO's nuclear umbrella to Russia's boarder. If Russia was about to give Cuba a guarantee that should the US ever get aggressive then Russia would start a nuclear war over it I'm pretty sure Congress would be keen to stop it and start developing their own buffer states near their boarder. 

Also it's not 'the occasional plane development', I would guess that about 50% of the Royal Airforce is US made, as is our entire nuclear deterrent and, in a few years time, every Navy fighter jet on our aircraft carriers. The money doesn't flow into the US budget it flows into US companies who donate to congressmen's campaigns and have the ear of US politicians. US politicians care so much about their domestic defence industry that they have been illegally subsidising Boeing for years and keep increasing the military budget even when military chiefs say they don't need the money. If Lockheed were to stop getting the orders from the EU they would probably donate a little more to a politician would confront the EU and get them to open up.

true,Noatak_Kenway,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; Grachten were the life-lines of Dutch and Flemish cities. They were used for many purposes: for transportation, for draining, for water-winning and as sewers, all at the same time. In heavy populated cities these combined functions repeatedly proved to be detrimental to the public health.
Most Hanseatic cities have grachten to transport, to load and to land goods in and from ships. Sometimes grachten were made from older rivers, like in Groningen. There the older river called Drentse Aa was used as a natural part of the grachten.

Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracht

So essentially, the Amsterdam's ''grachtengordel'' was used as a 'natural' defensive barrier - which separated countless ''blocks'' of houses, which made an invasion of the city a very difficult task -, a drainage system for human excrement and waste, and used as a ''highway'' for smaller (cargo)ships/boats to carry goods from a warehouse somewhere in the city towards the larger ships, ready to sail off to the colonies / trade partner or vice versa.

Also, bear in mind that Amsterdam was built on a marshy area, which was rich with flooded areas - as are more of the lower parts of the Netherlands, such as The Haque and Rotterdam -, so we (the Dutch) had to find some way to live harmoniously with the water as we still do today with the most intricate waterworks in the world.

**EDIT**: Also, in industrial- and modern day Netherlands; several cities have (or have had) a grachtengordel, which serves as a highway for goods, as I described above. These city highways (or the cities and villages themselves) would then be connected between one another by water ''highways'' throughout the Dutch countryside to transport goods all throughout the nation.

Bear in mind that before the mid-20th century, there were no highways in the Netherlands buzzing with large trucks that brought the goods from location to location; we had the intricate Dutch waterways to serve that purpose, all the way until after WW2 and still to this day.

One of the reasons Rotterdam is the largest and most used port in Europe, is because the Dutch waterways connect directly to the Ruhr-area and several important ''in-land ports'' at which the goods can be moved to trucks and transported further.",0,1395971216,null,0,1395986492,0,cgdt1qi,t3_21jele,t1_cgdt1qi,t1_cgdr329,null,1433101264,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,Trichos,BAVA,München (Munich),"You can only have two motivations to homeschool your children: either you think you can provide education for your children that is of higher quality than the public system, or you disagree with the syllabus and want to monitor, control, and censor facts. In short: either you're an academic with high standards, or — and surprise surprise, this was the movement that most fervently fought for homeschooling in the US — you are a religious fundamentalist.

If you are the former, you are hardly infringed by mandatory public education as you can still teach your kids outside of school. Only in the afternoon or on weekends, admittedly — but being the academic that you deem yourself to be, you must be an awesome teacher, and surely you're able to make it an über-entertaining experience for your kids any time.

But also, it takes away an incentive for you to engage in public and political debate about the quality of public education that is necessary to raise it for everyone. If public education is undermined, if education was again left to parents only, it would effectively be a redarwinization and desolidarization of society, making education (even more) a matter of hereditary fortune and turning the public system into a lowest-quality-but-affordable choice for kids of parents who lack education themselves.

And if you're a religious fundamentalist... well, obviously I couldn't possibly have any interest in making it easier for you to indoctrinate your children.

Homeschooling is illegal, as it should be.

I certainly dont think that. They have done some horrible things.

&gt;Don't get me wrong, I can understand why the Kurds would want to rebel, but killing extorting and terrorizing CIVILIANS is not doing a rebellion right.

Me and you are on the same page exactly. 

That said, they were radicalized because of what Turkey was doing. There were severe human rights abuses by Turkey out East. That is why they enjoy such wide support. Turkey does not exactly have a great track record when it comes to that. 

Although I am with you, and I said the same thing when I was out there. Even if every single thing they told me is true, it doesnt give them the right to kill innocent people. I will say most people agreed with that one point, they just couldn't handle the fact I was being critical of the PKK. 

I think most people do inherently view killing innocent people as wrong. When their main advocates are violent I think they tend to want what is in their self interest. I honestly think if they were given some semiautonomous status like Iraq many of these problems would go away. Or at least more political input. The Northern region of Iraq is more peaceful and consider the country it is in. But then again, I'm not Turkish. I understand there are territorial concerns and other concerns as well.

in terms of inland tourist destinations there's also quite a lot I suggest you don't overlook it if you're interested into non-beach and vastly less crowded things (also top tip; most croatian rivers are pretty damn clean except maybe Sava, so during the summer when it gets hot ask around some of the locals and maybe take a short drive down to some of the bathing ""beaches"" made out of pebbles usually that Croatians have set up at the best places in rivers for swimming. However do try to stay within those bathing areas because the river is flowing water so it can get dangerous if you don't know what you're doing and straying from normal bathing areas where there are a few other people, etc. I personally recommend the river Kupa near Zagreb as I usually go there when I'm in Zagreb during the summer.)

For the types of attractions inland they vary as widely as the geography; there's quaint medieval villages on water, there's a reconstruction of Tito's village near Zagreb showing how peasants lived all throughout the roman era till about the 1950s when modernization struck, there's a shitton of castles, then there's also slavonia which is the big eastern bit of Croatia where you get away from the hills and mountains of the midlands and see endless plains surrounding ancient/medieval era townships.

&gt;The former separatist religious leader (mufti) Akhmad Kadyrov, looked upon as a traitor by many separatists, was elected president with 83% of the vote in an internationally monitored election on October 5, 2003. Incidents of ballot stuffing and voter intimidation by Russian soldiers and the exclusion of separatist parties from the polls were subsequently reported by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitors. On May 9, 2004, Kadyrov was assassinated in Grozny football stadium by a landmine explosion that was planted beneath a VIP stage and detonated during a parade, and Sergey Abramov was appointed to the position of acting prime minister after the incident. However, since 2005 Ramzan Kadyrov (son of Akhmad Kadyrov) has been caretaker prime minister, and in 2007 was appointed a new president. Many allege he is the wealthiest and most powerful man in the republic, with control over a large private militia referred to as the Kadyrovtsy. The militia, which began as his father's security force, has been accused of killings and kidnappings by human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch.

* la tendance d'aujourd'hui à changer dès que quelquechose ne marche plus comme on veut. Le couple, la bagnole, les fringues... alors pourquoi pas la médecine si on n'est pas content du résultat (pourtant souvent inévitable).
  
* la médecine traditionnelle est complexe et il y a un sentiment de valorisation chez certaines personnes à penser comprendre comment fonctionne une médecine alternative. C'est plus facile, au cours d'un repas de dire *""Oui je me soigne par les algues, c'est hyper bon, c'est plein de vitamine K2, d'ailleurs c'est grâce à ça que les dauphins tiennent 12 minutes sous l'eau""* que d'expliquer le rôle des bêtabloquants.  

* C'est *""naturel""* et dans l'énorme almagame ambiant au sujet de l'écologie, c'est tendance de suivre une voie issue des plantes plutôt que de s'en remettre à l'énorme et méchante machine IRM de l'hôpital (tout en béton de surcroit).  

* C'est fortement marketé, au vu des étagères des pharmacies. Impossible de ne pas tomber sur la tisane detoxifiante à base de gelée de groseilles du Congo + Guarana du Perou (C'est 'un remède de grand-mère' longtemps mis de coté car beaucoup moins cher que les produits classiques.

true,thebadrash,null,null,"It's an interesting question. If you mean all the different activist groups, that could take an awfully long time to explain.

The main 'socialist' party in Catalonia is the PSC (Partit Socialista de Catalunya), a federated party of the Spanish PSOE. It's not really socialist at all, more of a centrist neo-liberal grouping with some more social-democrat social policies.

Another supposedly left-wing party is ERC (Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya), which is more in favor of Catalan independence than anything else. By which I mean that it will sign off on conservative budgets that hurt working people if it thinks it can help get the country closer to independence.

The main 'solid left' coalition here is Iniciativa (full name: Iniciativa Catalunya Verds, Esquerra Unida i Alternativa or ICV-EUiA) which combines several groups from the green and far-left fields. This party includes the remnants of the PSUC, Catalonia's own communist party which was formerly aligned with the Comintern during the civil war, unlike the main Spanish Communist Party. Iniciativa supports the 'right to decide' - meaning they want a referendum on independence, but different factions in the coalition have different positions on whether or not to support full independence.

On the far-left side, there is the CUP (Candidatura d'Unitat Popular), a fiercely 'anti-system' and pro-independence group that eschews traditional party mechanics for a system of autonomous assemblies, rotating leadership and policy by committee. It entered the Catalan parliament for the first time in 2012 after significant internal debates. It represents a broadly anti-capitalist ideology and supports Catalan independence 'To change it all!'.

Among the unions and syndicates, the anarchist CNT and AIT still exist but have very little active support these days. The main unions UGT and CCOO are formally independent but traditionally linked with the PSC. They support the 'right to decide'.

The 15M and Acampada movement is non-aligned and refuses to declare itself as pertaining to any ideology, which is very post-modern of them. In reality, they're a good bunch of anti-capitalists but in my opinion a little overly concerned about not appearing to be openly anarchist for fear of scaring away the sort of people who are scared away by that sort of label.

In terms of social action groups, the one I would highlight is the PAH (Plataforma d'Afectats per la Hipoteca) which leads 'Escrache' protests and tries to prevent foreclosure evictions. It also occupies bank offices to protest unfairness in the mortgage industry.

Then there's Teresa Forcades, a radical Catalan nun who proposes a socialist revolution and an independent Catalonia to establish a more just society. She's a doctor and has a lot to say about the Catalan public health service and the banking sector.

And a final one to look out for: Café amb Llet, which isn't an organization but a publication. They published details about corruption in the Catalan health service (always ignored in the established media) and were sued for defamation by one of the CiU politicians involved. They lost all their money, crowdfunded their defense, won, and are now preparing to publish a newspaper which they intend will reach a significant chunk of the Catalan population. They're a great pair and deserve everyone's support, in my humble opinion.

They don't know that Prussia had a huge influence on Japan during the Meiji Restauration, leading to German being the language spoken by Japanese physicians til the 1970s. 


Since they don't know much about Japan, those surveys can easily be influenced by how the questions are asked and if there is currently something going on in the media.

Here's a [Pew study](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:AL_d8KTcHYIJ:pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf+&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=is&amp;client=firefox-a) that may shed some light. European Muslims are much worse off in economic terms in comparison to the non-Muslim European population while US Muslims do alright in comparison to their non-Muslim counterparts.

P. 9:

&gt; The life situations and attitudes of
Muslim Americans stand in contrast with those
of Muslim minorities of Western Europe. Pew
Global Attitudes surveys conducted in 2006 in
Great Britain, France, Germany and Spain
found Muslims in these countries greatly
concerned about unemployment. Unlike
Muslims in the U.S., the average annual
incomes of Muslims in these countries lag well
behind the average incomes of non-Muslims.
Nearly half of Muslims in the U.S.
(47%) say they think of themselves first as a
Muslim, rather than as an American. But far
more Muslims in three of the four Western
European nations surveyed said they considered
themselves first as Muslims, rather than citizens
of their countries. In addition, Muslim
Americans’ views of the quality of life for
Muslim women in the U.S. also are relatively
positive when compared with Muslims in the
Western European countries surveyed. 

P. 25:

&gt; The extent to which Muslims are integrated
into the economic mainstream in America is in stark
contrast to the position of Muslims living in four
major Western European nations. Surveys of Muslim
populations in Great Britain, France, Germany and
Spain conducted in 2006 as part of the Pew Global
Attitudes Project found Muslims to be much less
affluent relative to the general populations of those
nations. For example, a majority of Muslims in
Germany (53%) reported family incomes of less than
18,000 euros annually compared with 35% of
Germans overall. A similar gap exists in France. In
Great Britain, 61% of Muslims reported incomes of
less than 20,000 pounds, compared with 39% of the
general public. And 73% of Spanish Muslims report
incomes of less than 14,500 euros compared with half
of the public nationwide.

&gt; Muslim Americans are slightly less likely than
members of the general public to express overall
satisfaction with their personal financial situation
(42% “excellent” or “good” vs. 49% in a recent
national survey).

Here's a [short but informative CFR summary of ""Muslims in the United States""](http://www.cfr.org/united-states/muslims-united-states/p25927):

&gt; Surveys also show U.S. Muslims overall are more affluent and educated than Muslim communities in Western Europe, which have had significant issues with poverty and integration. For example, a 2007 Pew poll found just 2 percent of U.S. Muslims in the lowest income bracket, while Muslims in Britain, France, and Germany made up around 20 percent of those countries' low-income populations.

&gt; Azzaoui writes that unlike the low-skilled labor immigration that Western Europe attracted following World War II, Muslim immigration to the United States during that time was in pursuit of college and advanced degrees. He suggests the experience of Muslims in the United States should be used as an argument in Europe that **""there is no causal connection between the Muslim faith and social problems.""**",0,1396000790,null,0,false,0,cge194w,t3_21kcp8,t1_cge194w,t1_cgdz1iv,null,1433105264,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

I'm not sure how much you've followed this, but there was this thing http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BitlKgCIYAEEXCl.jpg right from [this tweet](http://twitter.com/bueti/status/444560219532967936/photo/1).

I usually don't follow domestic media and politics much at all anymore, because all parties pretty much behave in predictable ways and it's not hard to know each party's vice. This (Crimea) was one of the instances however where I specifically turned to Google search to find out how intelligent the perspective of each of them is, and how they're broadcasting it.  
Didn't expect The Left to still be stuck in SED times, and didn't expect the Greens to surprise me positively (although the Greens are apparently split, with the more reasonable voices being those who actually either sit in or deal with the European Parliament on other levels). And I say that as a firm progressive/liberal.

Pretty much started by getting linked to this one http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-03/sahra-wagenknecht-krim-russland, which a friend described as anti left agitation, and while I agree that it isn't a formal and objective way of presenting a POV (it is an opinion piece), I found myself to agree with the arguments themselves, as I've seen first hand the kind of arguments Putin apologists use internationally, including RT and various other conspiracy and propaganda outfits. The Left was pretty much using the exact same talking points.  
Turns out Sevim Dağdelen (Die Linke) went so far as to tweet RT headlines and gave the channel an interview as well.

Sur l'affaire, et bien cela montre qu'il y a un décalage de perception entre les donateurs sur Kickstarter et les dirigeants de l'entreprise. Kickstarter est un site de don. On ne gagne pas d'argent avec, tout juste une promesse, qui n'est pas tout le temps tenue, loin de là, même quand l'objectif de dons est atteint. Un investisseur lui va détenir une partie du capital et va pouvoir toucher un retour sur investissement si ça se passe bien, voire participer aux prises de décision. 

Regardez les choses du point de vue du dirigeant: il lance une campagne Kickstarter, en échange de reconnaissance et de prototypes. Ça ne lui coûte pas grand chose, et par chance et/ou grâce à son talent la campagne est réussie. Il a donc une première base de clientèle, passionnée, et obtient une pub gratuite sur le financement réussi via le crowdfunding, sujet à la mode dans les médias high-tech. Avec ça il arrive à convaincre des investisseurs plus fortunés (banques, fonds, capital-risque etc) qui mettent bien plus d'argent dans l'affaire (75M€ vs 2.5M€). Il faut savoir que ces gens là ont une *exit strategy*, un plan pour sortir rapidement de cette entreprise en ayant fait un bénéfice important. Leur raison d'être c'est de faire du fric, pas de gérer le développement d'une entreprise. Arrive Facebook qui voit là une opportunité et offre un gros paquet d'argent. Pour les investisseurs, c'est gagné, ils ont multiplié la mise en peu de temps. Pour le PDG aussi, il est maintenant millionnaire et peut continuer à gérer la boîte (on est d'accord, les choses vont sans doute changer, mais il reste toujours en place).

Au fond, il reste une méconnaissance par les donateurs du capitalisme, et peut-être de la naïveté ou une duplicité du jeune entrepreneur.",0,1396005512,null,0,false,0,cge1zc5,t3_21kves,t1_cge1zc5,t3_21kves,null,1433105606,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

I know this sub is a circle jerk (I mod /r/europeanculture so I'm part of it) but jesus - the EU pitted Ukraine as a pawn against Russia from the start. 

The EU and US are partly responsible for the mess Ukraine is going to devolve into in the next few years. 

1. First, they rejected Ukraine’s suggestion — to which Russia initially had no objection — that accession to the European Union could be compatible with membership in the Customs Union, the precursor to a Eurasian Union linking former Soviet states. Now they have apparently also rejected President Viktor Yanukovich’s proposal to resolve the remaining issues (the main one being the very real possibility of European goods being dumped into Russia through Ukraine) through a three-way format that would include efforts to curb cross-border smuggling — something one would think would also concern Brussels. 

2. Second, instead of highlighting those values that would have honored Ukraine’s Slavic European identity, the European Union actively promoted the notion that accession was a “civilizational choice” between Russia and Europe. Since the majority of Ukrainians traditionally regard Russia as their closest and friendliest neighbor, is it any wonder that they balked at such a choice? 

3. Finally, European negotiators made the strategic error of ignoring substantial differences in traditional and religious values. The fear among a significant part of Ukraine’s Christian population is that the European Union would impose a very liberal moral agenda on the Ukrainian legal and educational system, including nontraditional family values that many here categorically reject. Spokesmen for the European Union made no effort to assuage these concerns, and their condescension on this matter has placed a ticking bomb under European integration efforts throughout the entire region. In sum, instead of approaching these negotiations as a partnership, the European Union behaved more like the owner of a country club which, while it might consider allowing Ukraine to caddy, would never consider granting it club membership. No wonder Mr. Yanukovich called the entire process “humiliating” for his country.

Loin de moi l'idée de faire du mauvais esprit, mais j'ai vraiment l'impression que vous visez un peu trop haut. L'idée d'apporter du contenu scientifique francophone sur reddit est tout à fait louable selon moi, mais créer un sous reddit dedié semble un peu trop ambitieux. La vivacité des posts sur /r/ScienceFR en est une illustration.

La discussion sur la pertinence du subreddit a déja eu lieu, je ne veux donc pas la relancer.

Maintenant, un AMA orienté science pourrait être très interessant, mais pourquoi ne pas le mettre sur /r/france ? Il y a déja eux quelques AMAs, et certains ont eu leur petit succès, mais on ne peut pas dire que l'on croule sous les propositions. Côté lecteur comme rédacteur, je pense que tout le monde a à y gagner à ce que ce genre de AMA soit posté sur /r/france.

For the same reason there is still a seat in Strassbourg - you would have to open the Treaties and all MS have to ratify a change - which the countries affected won't in either case.

I don't see how moving the Parliament to Romania would change the big picture. It would cost a **fortune**, the Parliament owns a lot of property in Brussels, the Commission and Council are both there. So you would have to build everything a new, sell the old property at a loss since so much of it is very specific (what company/public body other than the EP needs so many rooms for plenary sessions?).

It's the difference between real freedom and negative freedom. Negative freedom is equality under the law. Real (or 'positive') freedom is freedom to actually do things. Negative freedom says you have a right to starve yourself, if you want to. Positive freedom says you have a right *to* eat. You have a right to ensure you don't starve, a right *to* education, a right *to* *real* membership of society. 

A lot of people in the Parisian slums (and the London ones) don't have these real, effective opportunities. They're not really free. It's societies' job to make them so.

Je trouve que Soral a bien plus de qualités que beaucoup d'hommes politiques.

* Il a une idéologie avec une cohérence interne

* Il apporte une vision marxiste que plus personne n'a

* Il est assez intelligent pour se forger un avis sur tout

* Il a raison sur un certain nombre de sujets

* Il amène des gens à se cultiver et s'instruire.

Après tu as raison de critiquer les moutons.

Non je parlais bien de ce que l'on appelle les complotistes. Sur tout les sujets je pense qu'il y a besoin que des avis divergent. 

Notre monde moderne a inventé une drôle de chose : le prêt à penser, on donne une pensée au gens et ces derniers ne font plus l'effort de se faire un avis sur quoi que ce soit en partant de 0. 

Certains prennent quand même la peine de partir de 0 sur des sujets, c'est difficile, crois moi, et parfois il arrive que ceux qui partent sur un sujet sans aucun préjugé arrivent à des conclusions différentes de la masse qui a choisit le prêt à penser. Ce jeux est dangereux, et on peut toujours se tromper, c'est un risque à prendre. Sauf que ceux qui veulent défendre la pensée unique ont inventé un nouveau mot : les complotistes, qui désigne tout ceux qui sont en désaccord avec la version mainstream sur un sujet.

Dorénavant, sur tout sujet, une vérité est instauré au commencement, cette vérité instauré, qu'elle soit vrai ou fausse, ce n'est pas le débat, est irréversible car à partir du moment ou elle a été définit, tout ceux qui vont à son encontre sont des complotistes et sont mis au banc de la société.

Aha, brauchen wir also nicht. Nagut. Wer recht hat, darüber brauchen wir auch nicht zu reden, das bin nämlich ich.

Und wenn man seine Argumente lobenswerterweise mit Quellen untermauern möchte, dann zitiert man entweder aus den Quellen oder gibt eine ungefähre Position an. Ansonsten kannste mal [Moby Dick](http://www.literaturepage.com/read/mobydick.html) lesen, dann weißte schon bescheid.

Der Focus-Artikel fängt allerdings schon lustig an:

&gt;So glauben einige Forscher, unsere vierbeinigen oder gefiederten Verwandten seien so etwas wie organische Automaten, die ein artspezifisches Verhaltensrepertoire abspulen.

Als ob es inzwischen bewiesen wäre, daß der Mensch *kein* organischer Automat ist. Im Gegenteil. Alle wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse konnten bisher keine Hinweise darauf finden, daß er keiner ist. Wir wissen immer noch nicht, wozu Qualia eigentlich gut sind, aber sprechen sie anderen Spezies ab, weil sie uns verborgen bleiben.

&gt; &gt; „Es gibt keine Eigenschaft des Menschen“, konstatiert der Zoologie-Professor Norbert Sachser von der Universität Münster, „die nicht als Vorform schon bei Tieren angelegt wäre“.

&gt; Darauf nun die implizierte Aussage folgend, dass der Mensch durch sein weiterentwickeltes Gehirn zu einer komplexeren Bewusstseinsebene[1] und damit einem Ausbau aller tierischen Merkmale[2] fähig ist, bishin zur Bildung von ""Alleinstellungs""merkmalen.

[2] ist Unsinn. Eine Fledermaus, ein Wal, ein Schmetterling oder eine Schlange wären so gut wie blind und nicht überlebensfähig, wenn sie mit den ""ausgebauten"" menschlichen Merkmalen ausgestattet wären. Und ja, Sinneseindrücke verarbeiten ist die zentrale Aufgabe des Gehirns; es geht hier also nicht darum, daß Fledermäuse bessere Ohren haben, sie haben vor allem das bessere Gehirn was ihre Hörfähigkeiten angeht.

[1] Und wieder so ein vager Begriff. Was ist denn eine Bewußtseinsebene und wie bemißt man ihre Komplexität?

Aber selbst wenn wir mal annehmen, daß Du in allem recht hast: Warum sind Menschen jetzt eigentlich keine Tiere? Weil sie intelligenter, bewußter und schlauer sind? Warum ausgerechnet diese Merkmale zur Unterscheidung und nicht Schnelligkeit, Körpergröße oder Visualität? Zeig mir mal ein Wörterbuch aus dem aktuellen Jahrhundert, das ""Tier"" so definiert wie Du.

Ich glaub ja eher, daß es einfach nicht praktikabel ist, sich mit anderen Spezies auf eine Stufe zu stellen. Wir wollen Schnitzel essen und Schädlinge bekämpfen. Und es gibt auch keinen Grund, bei Tieren aufzuhören. Pflanzen haben nicht weniger Recht auf Leben, nur weil sie keine Menschen sind, genauso wie Schwarze nicht weniger Recht auf Leben haben, nur weil sie keine Weißen sind. Beides sind Eigenschaften, auf die das Individuum keinen Einfluß hat. Aber wenn man das konsequent umsetzt, dann verhungert man halt.

USA might send conventional forces but shipping armaments takes a while and they have tied a lot of resources into Middle-East.

This is defined in the constitution as a case of immediate danger for Germany and has to be declared by a 2/3 mayority in both chambers of Parliament (can be done retroactively if an actual attack is taking place).  
This declaration has far reaching consequences, one of them is that all elections are put on hiatus while the case is active...  
I think it was ammended to the constitution in the 60s, when the only war people could imagine had been WWIII.
The Verteidungsfall had been regarded as the only time when the Bundeswehr would be called to arms - until the involvement in the Kosovo conflict and later in Afghanistan.  
Now the talk is of ""Bündnispflicht"" - alliance duty, since of course the Verteidungsfall cannot be declared since it is only designed for a full scale war.
This leads to weird situations for the soldiers - for a long time politicians were saying that Afghanistan is no war (since a war would fall under the Verteidigungsfall).

C'est ton choix. Chacun fait le sien. Je vois pas en quoi ""morale et business ça fait deux"" (ben... chacun sa morale, non ? Si c'est pas la tienne, ça signifie qu'elle est invalide ?), ou que l'Homme est ""foncièrement mauvais"" (parce qu'un jeune mec inventif et intelligent revend sa boîte à un autre jeune mec inventif et intelligent ?).

Ceux qui finançaient l'Oculus Rift savaient à quoi ils s'exposaient : à recevoir uniquement des contreparties définies à l'avance. S'ils avaient voulu devenir proprios de la boîte, celle-ci levait des fonds y'a pas longtemps. Ils peuvent aussi devenir proprios de FB. Ou de Google. Ou de n'importe quelle start-up cherchant des fonds.

Si les gens ont envie de devenir actionnaires de sociétés, ils peuvent également le devenir. Dans l'opération, ils risquent aussi de tout perdre, ou de miser sur un mauvais cheval ; mais ils seront co-propriétaires de la société. Ils ne recevront pas de produit en contrepartie, par contre.

En quoi les créateurs de l'Oculus sont *mauvais* ? Est-ce qu'ils ont menti ? Est-ce qu'ils ont roulé dans la farine des gens ? Nope. Ils ont parlé d'un projet qui était cool (et le reste). Ils se sont fait financer pour cela, sans demande d'appropriation de la part des financeurs. Ils ont monté un truc cool. Ils l'ont revendu. Ils avaient d'ailleurs déjà levé des fonds depuis les 2,4 millions ""originels"".

C'est soit de la mauvaise foi (journalistique et de Kickstarter), soit de la bêtise de la part de certains commentateurs, soit de l'inconscience de ceux finançant ce genre de projets de trouver l'attitude d'Oculus Rift condamnable. Il me semble que personne n'a menti lors du lancement du projet Kickstarter : Oculus proposait un produit cool à monter soi-même contre un financement. C'était une sorte de pré-vente. Et des internautes auraient voulu devenir propriétaires/actionnaires de la boîte en plus, ou décider de sa future politique longtemps après ? Une pipe et un Mars, avec ça ?...

Bei sowas selbstevidentem wie die größere menschliche Intelligenz (primär als Potential zu logischem Denken) brauchen wir auch nciht zu reden. Das infrage zu stellen ist schon so absurd, dass ich über sonen Unsinn gar nicht diskutieren will.

Weil ich mir also nicht die unnötige Mühe machen werde bekannte Forschungen zu verlinken (jeder kennt zb. die Einordnung versch. tierischer Intelligenzen in Größenordnung menschlicher Kleinkinder.), kannst du ja gerne versuchen mir irgendwas zu liefern, dass Tiere so intelligent wie Menschen sind. Ich warte.

&gt;Qualia eigentlich gut sind, aber sprechen sie anderen Spezies ab, weil sie uns verborgen bleiben.

Bleiben dir Qualia beim Menschen vollständig verborgen? Nein, man liest aus dem Verhalten bestimmte Empfindungen der Spezies ab und erkennt bestimmte Tendenzen aufgrund externe Studie.

Selbstverständlich trifft man da auf Grenzen, kann den Sachverhalt aber doch ein wenig einengen und Vergleiche anstellen. Zb zwischen Mensch und versch. Tierarten.

Damit hat man vielleicht keine endgültigen Beweise für endgültige Wahrheiten, aber doch Indizien um -wie gesagt- tendenzen zu erkennen.

&gt;[2] ist Unsinn. Eine Fledermaus, ein Wal, ein Schmetterling oder eine Schlange wären so gut wie blind und nicht überlebensfähig, wenn sie mit den ""ausgebauten"" menschlichen Merkmalen ausgestattet wären. Und ja, Sinneseindrücke verarbeiten ist die zentrale Aufgabe des Gehirns; es geht hier also nicht darum, daß Fledermäuse bessere Ohren haben, sie haben vor allem das bessere Gehirn was ihre Hörfähigkeiten angeht.

Ja und? Seit wann ist ein guter Hörsinn so wichtigund auschlaggebend für die Bewusstseinebene (weiter: Reflexionsebene) wie das Potential der Intelligenz? Ich möchte nochmal daran erinnern, wer und warum er an der Spitze der Nahrungskette steht.

&gt;[1] Und wieder so ein vager Begriff. Was ist denn eine Bewußtseinsebene und wie bemißt man ihre Komplexität?

Man kanns nicht konkret beziffern, aber sehr wohl Tendenzen aufstellen und die sind oft eindeutig, wenn es nicht gerade Grenzfälle mit Menschenaffen oder Meeressäugern sind.

&gt;Aber selbst wenn wir mal annehmen, daß Du in allem recht hast: Warum sind Menschen jetzt eigentlich keine Tiere? Weil sie intelligenter, bewußter und schlauer sind? Warum ausgerechnet diese Merkmale zur Unterscheidung und nicht Schnelligkeit, Körpergröße oder Visualität? Zeig mir mal ein Wörterbuch aus dem aktuellen Jahrhundert, das ""Tier"" so definiert wie Du.

[Zb. der Duden:](http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Mensch_Lebewesen_Individuum)

* Bedeutungen

 a) mit der Fähigkeit zu logischem Denken und zur Sprache, zur sittlichen Entscheidung und Erkenntnis von Gut und Böse ausgestattetes höchstentwickeltes Lebewesen

^(Wobei ich da auch ein wenig kontrovers zur Formulierung gegenüberstehe, da Tiere auch Potential zur Logik haben und Sitte das menschl. Potential zur Vernunft nur impliziert.)

&gt;Ich glaub ja eher, daß es einfach nicht praktikabel ist, sich mit anderen Spezies auf eine Stufe zu stellen. Wir wollen Schnitzel essen und Schädlinge bekämpfen. Und es gibt auch keinen Grund, bei Tieren aufzuhören. **Pflanzen haben nicht weniger Recht auf Leben, nur weil sie keine Menschen sind, genauso wie Schwarze nicht weniger Recht auf Leben haben, nur weil sie keine Weißen sind.** Beides sind Eigenschaften, auf die das Individuum keinen Einfluß hat. Aber wenn man das konsequent umsetzt, dann verhungert man halt.

Alter, vergleichst dus grade echt mit Rassismus.

Du machst da grade ein Fass ohne Boden auf, nämlich die Frage nach einem ""grundsätzlichen Recht auf Leben"" und noch dazu die allgemeine Frage nach einem Bewusstsein von Pflanzen.

Abgesehen davon ist der auf Irrationalität begründete Rassismus als Vergleich maximal daneben.

Wenn ich mich ganz rational -bzw materialistisch- argumentieren will, kann ich jedenfalls durch die fehlende kognitiven Vorraussetzung der Pflanzen (kein Gehirn) schonmal jegliche Form von auch nur tierähnlichem Bewusstsein und sogar Emotionen auschließen. Jetzt ist die Frage: Ein Organismus der ""nicht denkt"" und nicht fühlen kann, hat ein Recht auf Leben? So ähnlich wie Bakterien zb?

Und dann würde ich zb sagen: Etwas das nicht denken oder fühlen kann, ist es doch egal wenn ich es ""töte"", ja? So wie bei aktive Sterbehilfe. Und da findet sich doch auch ne große Mehrheit (allgemein zurecht imho, aber darüber will ich jz nciht auch noch diskutieren).

Egal welche Position ich zu diesem philosophischem Problem einnehme, zu dem es prinzipiell keine endgültige Wahrheit gibt: Deine  Behauptung, dass überhaupt etwas das ""Recht"" auf Leben hat is nicht haltbar und darüber hinaus ist es mindestens kontrovers, Pflanzen überhaupt soetwas wie dieses Recht (wie es höherentwickelte Lebensformen wie Tiere und der Mensch besitzen) zu zusprechen, eben wegen den mehr als offensichtlichen Unterschieden zwischen Mensch und Pflanze. Wenn ich Pflanzen das Recht auf Leben zuspreche, dann kann ich das ja auch bei Bakterien. Und dann bei Viren. Und dann bei miteinander reagierenden Reagenzien (wie ist eigentlich Leben entstanden?). Und dann bei Mineralien. Könnte ja sein, dass das alles ein Bewusstsein hat.

Es sei denn man argumentiert materialitisch, dass weder Steine, noch Viren, Bakterien, oder Pflanzen überhaupt Vorraussetzungen für bestimmte Bewusstseinsebenen besitzen können und damit auch eine gewisse Stufe des Lebens erreichen können (Def. von Leben? Wenn wir schon über Recht auf Leben sprechen). Bei Tieren und Menschen sind bestimmte Bewusstseinsebenen in der Tendenz offensichtlich, dein Gerede von Pflanzenrecht auf Leben zeigt mMn nur, dass du über das Thema bist jetzt nur einseitig nachgdacht hast.
 

Final hast du die reale Konsequenz einer solchen radikalen Haltung nebenbei ja schon erkannt: wenn Pflanzen ein Recht auf Leben haben, kannste den Laden ganz dicht machen.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"Very few of them would have been active at any one time. The leadership of both countries wanted to be ready for every eventuality. For instance, to be able to deploy nuclear warheads to other parts of the world at the drop of a hat, like during the Cuban Missile Crisis where Fidel Castro overthrew the Batista regime in order to create a Communist state which then requested protection from the USA by the USSR, which Khrushchev (leader of the USSR at the time) was all too willing to do, and took the opportunity to deploy nuclear warheads which arrived and started being deployed in a matter of weeks. 

You've got to remember the unbelievably tense atmosphere of the Cold War and the sense that everything could change at any moment. Events in the Third World (Africa, Middle East, South Asia and South America) were constantly opening opportunities to undermine and weaken enemy positions. ^(For instance the Communist Revolution in Angola, Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan [which put India in danger], the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, the Berlin Crisis 1951, the Berlin Wall and partition of Germany 1961, the Vietnam War and many many more.) Each one of these positions could have lead to nuclear confrontation if the superpowers at the time handled things badly enough. 

It also wasn't a simple USSR and the East Vs. USA and the West. On more than one occasion relations between China and the USSR became so bad that they actually started shooting at each other along the border (fortunately this didn't escalate, much). China is also, for reference, a nuclear weapons state and has been for most of the Cold War. France actually left NATO at one point to try and take foreign policy in its own direction (France later rejoined, fortunately). It wasn't merely about protection from your one true enemy, it's about protection from *everybody else*.

The last real example I can draw on is an anecdote from Robert MacNamara, former secretary of defense under JFK and later Johnson. The sorts of hysteria that went on in the war rooms was apparently pretty ridiculous.

You are talking about wealthy Russians. That pales in comparison with corporate investments. The Russian Finance Minister estimated sanctions will cost the Russian economy $100 billion in capital flight ~~per year~~ per quarter (if they're all implemented). That is 20% of Russia's GDP per year. 

You might bring up foreign reserves, but it is incredibly expensive to try to counter world markets when it comes to currency movements. Russia's central bank spent $16 billion of its dollar reserves to counter the Ruble's fall in the first few days of the crisis. With the damage capital flight worth 20% of Russia's economy would do to the Ruble you would see central bank intervention get *much* more expensive in terms of dollars and euros. 

The Venezuelan Bolivar has plummeted compared to the dollar this year, depsite them having more proven energy reserves than Saudi Arabia. This is because their dollar reserves are dwindling. So as Russia spends reserves to defend the Ruble in the short term, it causes more uncertainly in the long term, causing people to sell Rubles. There is not a specific % number of reserves a country has, but if central bank foreign holdings drop substantially institutional investors no longer feel comfortable holding the currency. So it is a catch-22.

And then there was the reminder last week that the US not only has pumping capacity, but is sitting on 700 million barrels of oil when it released 5 million barrels and the global price reacted.

&gt;Look, I don't think you can deny that Die Linke has had a pacifistic agenda, historically speaking. And while I disagree with them on most matters I consider SED allegations a rather cheap blow by now.

I thought so too, previously. In this instance however there seems to be a specific type of people who still fall for the dogma of ""Fascism is our #1 enemy. Russia freed us from it in WW2. Therefor Russia can never be fascist, by definition. Any and all criticism of Kyiv is welcome and focusing on Russia's potential wrongdoings is only of marginal importance.""

It doesn't matter that Russia  
• is militarily occupying, partitioning and annexing part of a country  
• doing so on ethnic grounds  
• violated international law and treaties to do so, touting Cold War propaganda phrases in its defense  
• that Putin controls virtually all of Russia's media, that he is an autocrat, and that he is pushing nationalism and hatred against minorities in his own country  
• that the same kind of media control was immediately exerted in Crimea  

None of that matters, because there are a handful of 'fascists' in an interim government in Kyiv, and therefor it is clear which side we must be on.  
Just an interim government? We'll ignore that.  
Svoboda only has popular support of 10% of the population and was only the smallest of several political parties that were involved in the Maidan protests? We'll ignore that, too.  
The Right Sector barely has any significance at all? Unimportant.  
There might be good reasons to wish for territorial integrity and independence of your country and not being very fond of Russia? Meh.  
All of that is dwarfed by scary pictures and the observation that nationalism=fascism=evil, Russia=historical enemy of fascism and the West!

true,gensek,ESTO,Estmark,"It's silly of you to ignore the parliamentary politics that went on in parallel. The government was brought down _by the democratically elected parliament_, not your mythical ""armed paramilitaries"". Let me try to explain.

After the 2012 elections, the Party of Regions had the largest faction in the parliament by far. They had more representatives than the next three factions (Batkivshchyna, UDAR &amp; Svoboda) combined, so they, the Communists and part of the unaffiliated representatives (about 10% of the parliament) had the majority and voted in the Azarov government. A government voted in by the democratically elected parliament (a ""democratically elected government"" some eejits around here call it).

Now we come to Euromaidan. By that time Party of Regions had further increased their lead by picking up about half of the independents during the intervening period, so their position was even stronger. Then - November 30, and police beating up student demonstrators on Maidan. First representatives left PoR faction within days, citing ethical considerations.

Can you see where this is leading?

Under parliamentary systems the power relations within a parliament can change, and sometimes change fast. As the violent crackdown intensified in February, the PoR faction lost _a third of their remaining representatives_ in less than a week; representatives who didn't want to be associated with the crackdown - or the president.

And all that happened _while the Parliament building was still behind the police lines_, and neither the protesters nor your imaginary paramilitaries hadn't reached it yet. PoR was in such a sorry shape that they went public distancing themselves from both the president and the crackdown. The Azarov government had lost their majority support. Now, what happens when a government loses parliamentary support? They resign. Or, the PM resigns and the government goes with him. Which is precisely what happened.

But by that time two _new_ factions had formed in the parliament, Economic Development (mostly former PoR members) and SEU (former independents and PoR members). So by the time of your ""coup"" the power relations in parliament were roughly as follows: PoR ~120, Batkivshchyna ~90; UDAR, Svoboda, Communists and the new guys – ED &amp; SEU - had all around 35 members. Start doing the math;)

Basically, thanks to Yanukovych's crackdown, ""his"" government lost its backing. The three opposition parties _and_ the new factions agreed to set up a new government _with broad parliamentary backing_ in order to attempt stabilizing the situation. PoR _supported that move_, even if they declared they wouldn't be participating in the new government. If the Azarov government was legitimate because it had the elected parliament's backing, then _so is the Yatseniuk government_.

Now tell me again: _how was it a coup_?

edit: and respect to those PoR representatives who didn't compromise themselves while the going was good to necessitate a literal escape from the country at slightest hint of power changing. It's largely thanks to the few dozen of them who showed up to vote during those few critical days that the Rada was quorate.",1,1396016803,null,0,1396023251,0,cge54rv,t3_21kz71,t1_cge54rv,t1_cge4e8v,null,1433107092,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

That's exactly what I meant, sorry if I implied anything different. Fun fact though, Farage wouldn't mind taking money from EU's help fund (or whatever the name - just in case you assume something different than what is commonly known and was talked about a lot in the news).

&gt;Yeah you're just a hyperbolic liar at this point.

Oh yes, of course. 

Firstly, who pays green taxes? Only poor people? Scrapping them completely means nobody pays for them, so giving examples of poverty in Britain as the reason of scrapping green taxes, which btw aren't that expensive for households is a very bad argument. 

Secondly, the fact that people use food banks or children go hungry doesn't mean those people can't afford somehow to buy cigarettes or a beer. It's actually the opposite, hard situation means they tend to go for these more often, due to stress or the fact they are at the bottom end by choice (which unfortunately is very often) etc. Maybe not a great example but it's hard to get any other, watch Benefits Street and see how many of those who were receiving benefit there were holding fags or a can of beer in like EVERY episode.

Thirdly, how about not being an anti-green moron, which Farage clearly is (he opposes man made climate change, even though around 95% of scientists say otherwise) and if he cares so much about ""poor Brits"", help them in some other way or simply by saying that poor people wouldn't have to pay those green taxes?

&gt;Firstly, who pays green taxes? Only poor people? Scrapping them completely means nobody pays for them, so giving examples of poverty in Britain as the reason of scrapping green taxes, which btw aren't that expensive for households is a very bad argument. 

&gt;Maybe not a great example but it's hard to get any other, watch Benefits Street and see how many of those who were receiving benefit there were holding fags or a can of beer in like EVERY episode.

For the record I don't support UKIP - I think they're a backward and vile party. I'll be voting green but the fact of the matter is Farage is right on Ukraine and he's right on a fair few issues too. Being very anti interventionist after propganda and lies for Vietnam/Iraq and Afghanistan means I honestly don't give a shit about Ukraine and don't think the UK should intervene any further than it has via the EU. 

I'm not arguing about green taxes you imbecile. Green taxes should exist. I was merely pointing out your example of ""British people wanting fags"" was a disingenous bigoted lie.

It's not a fascist plot by any stretch of imagination if you will actually look at how the events went. 

Far right movements like Right Sector did gain a boost of popularity during the protests because they were one of the more organized powers that could fight with Berkut and protect the protesters. That combined with populist rhetoric (although some of it was calling for right things to do - lustration, technocrat ministers, etc.) won them some favours. But as things went on their popularity started to dwindle especially with yesterday's attempt to block Parliament building. Consensus among ordinary folk in Ukraine is that if you have guns and have motivation - enlist to the National Guard. They'll find what you could do. The only really popular person in Right Sector is their leader Dmitry Yarosh, the organization itself doesn't enjoy the same level of popularity. It's in Yarosh's interests right now to reform the movement and make a party out of it and that would mean first of all disbanding his armed units.

As for Svoboda, they always were a marginal party and only gained parliament seats when other opposition parties were really really disappointing their voters. On the top of that Svoboda is really frustrating their core voters in the West right now.

I wouldn't say that neither Svoboda nor Right Sector are popular right now. Your average voter understands that nationalist rhetoric is dangerous for the country right now and will look for an alternative that would unite both East and West.

That is why they were so intent on preserving Yugoslavia, it cost them dearly to preserve it in 2 world wars.

You see a lot about income inequality in the US. But I am not as concerned about it as some are. If you look at the richest people in the US most are entrepreneurs. The big exception is the Waltons (Wal-Mart) who inherited their wealth. But if some people get exceptionally wealthy, and employ tens or hundreds of thousands of people with good salaries I am not sure it is an awful thing. 

I think people are too hung up on income inequality, when they should be looking at quality of life. Most disposable income studies dont take into account services people spend money on in the US that are covered by taxes elsewhere, namely education and healthcare. I did find one metric, by the British government, that shows disposable income that adjusts for private market purchases for certain essentials. In their study the US consistently comes out on top. It isn't as if these billionaires are making sure everyone else lives in poverty, quite the opposite actually. I think people starting companies that create high quality jobs is a good thing, regardless of if they get incredibly wealthy (although dont read this as being against reforming the tax code, but its not as bad as many people think). 

In this context, I have to say I disagree with the ""European"" view that billionaires are bad. If it was aristocracy that inherited their wealth I would agree, but that is not the case. In fact it is Europeans who continue to support aristocracy and royalty with taxes, and these people contribute nothing to the economy. At least the founders of Google, Microsoft, Oracle, etc. have contributed and continue to contribute something. So in that sense I completely disagree with what seems to be the prevailing European mindset that billionaires are bad. I think the US needs to continue to make sure its seen as a destination for new businesses where you have to pay a fair tax, but not have your success looted.

He does, which is why I'm not willing to throw him in with people like Sevim Dağdelen I mentioned earlier entirely. He still enables their ignorance though, and he is going for simplistic comparisons.  

Criticizing NATO might be a naive attempt at maintaining peace and cooperation with Russia, if you want to cut him that much slack.  
But it is also the wrong way to approach the situation imo, since it is no else's business where one country seeks cooperation and alliances. NATO didn't pressure countries to join afaik (might be wrong), but countries lined up to join NATO on their own accord, because of Russia's own foreign policy failures, which resulted in people seeking protection from rather than closeness to it. To criticize NATO here seems almost bizarre. It's self determination, and, again, the difference between explaining and justifying Russia's stance.  

I also wouldn't be taking this stance had I not heard all of these arguments 1:1 from Putin apologists, RT and elsewhere, day after day, week after week before. On its own, with no additional context, Gysi's speech may be taken as reasonable enough and it could even be said that it brings much needed nuance (though still too simplistic), which is indeed the job of the opposition, but also that of any good and honest individual.

Glad that you gave me the time to finish editing my previous comment, btw. I really suck at organizing and formatting arguments. Also refreshing to see someone who at least appears to be open minded.

The thing is, there is no definitive ""beginning"" to the conflict. You could say it was one Fidel Castro overthrew Batista in an area of the World which was decisively within the US' sphere of influence. You could say it was when the USA put an oppressive dictator in Cuba. You could say it was when the Americans stationed nuclear weapons in Turkey and Greece. You could say it began when the Grand Alliance to defeat the Nazis officially broke down in 1951 when Stalin refused to allow British, French and American supplies through East German territory to reach West Berlin. You could say it was in 1917, when the Western powers sent troops to Russia to support the Tsar and divert the communist, revolutionary Bolsheviks. You could say it was when Karl Marx wrote the Communist Manifesto or Das Capital. You could say it was when the Founding Fathers wrote the constitution of the United States which setforth ideals completely at odds with soviet/communist ones. 

Nobody acts in a vacuum. No event in history has clear factors which began the whole process, because those factors were triggered in themselves by other factors. However, the majority of the time it is unnecessary to relate an event in World history to events which took place several hundred years previously, as with the CMC and founding of the United States, which is the problem you get into if you try and recount a proper evaluation of the events which lead up to any event. 

The reason I'm giving this long explanation is to point out that neither the Americans should be blame (as with a revisionist interpretation) or the Soviets (as with an Orthodox interpretation). It is factors outside both of their control, like history and circumstance, which brought them to act the way they did. Even Fidel Castro is the victim of this.

As for banning things left and right: 

&gt;Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. — In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.

true,Frankeh,UKGB,United Kingdom,"It's because of the fear of a sneak attack. 

No one on either side was under the illusion that there were any secret ICBM sites.. It was assumed spies had found out about them all and each country would therefore be targeting each others silos/sites. 

So upon a sneak attack from one side, there still needs to be enough silos and missiles left to counter attack. 

So a sneak attack might destroy 90% of the silos before they could ready and launch the missiles but the other 10% would be enough to lay waste to the soviet union.. So the deterrent is still intact. 


Plus there were SO many different types of nuclear bombs. ICBM's, artillery (not joking), personal nuke launchers (Again, not joking), nuclear mines, plane drop...
