They do. Territories get intermittent referendums on whether they want to become states, stay territories, or become independent nations. PR voted to become a state in its last election, but it still has a ways to go. 20-25% of its GDP is made up of federal transfers, mostly in the way of welfare type benefits. It has corruption and other issues to tend to before it has a serious chance of statehood. Assume Moldova was in Schengen and the EU for some reason provided benefits that amounted to 20-25% of its GDP, yet it was not an EU member. That is essentially PR.

I made this map to see which country invests the most in each country (with territory) in Europe. I gathered the information by looking at the data for “Inward FDI flows by geographical region” in the central bank or national statistics office website (or IMF) of each country (with territory) in Europe. For some of the countries I had to use “FDI flows (stocks)” data, because there wasn’t any other option available.

**Important note #1:** I must admit that I am not a (certified) economist, so I have to leave the questions concerning FDI flows, stocks and/or equity to the knowledgeable.

**Important note #2:** Some of the source links in the table below are download links of .XSL or .PDF files or lead to e-databases, wherein you have to adjust the indicators to see the data.

Der zugegebenermaßen höhere Prozentsatz von Trollen im Netz im vergleich zur Straße liegt finde ich nicht an fehlenden Klarnamen, sondern an:

- Fehlendem visuellen Feedback. Am an deren Ende meiner Beleidigung sitzt kein Mensch, alles ist nur ein Haufen Buchstaben. Ich sehe nicht, wie meine Worte wehtun.

- Zu viele Leute mit zu vielen unterschiedlichen Zielen diskutieren mit. Viele davon sind an der Diskussion an sich nicht mal interessiert, sie wollen Werbung machen, Recht haben und sich toll fühlen oder ihre Meinung möglichst vielen Menschen möglichst direkt ins Hirn drücken, auf dass sie jeder annehmen möge. Wer beruflich öfter mal in ner Besprechung sitzt weiß, dass jenseits von 5 Leuten schnell nur noch sinnloses Geblubber rum kommt.

- Fehlende Konsequenzen. Wer sich im echten Leben öfters daneben benimmt, bekommt soziale Konsequenzen zu spüren, auch wenn die Grenze zur Illegalität noch längst nicht überschritten ist. Freunde wenden sich ab, man wird zu Events nicht mehr eingeladen und der ein oder andere geigt einem recht unangenehm die Meinung. Das alles fehlt im Internet. Klarnamen helfen da übrigens nicht, immerhin kann ich als Reddit-User mit der Info, dass mein Gegenüber ""Hans Meier"" heißt genauso wenig was anfangen wie mit einem Alias.

Alles in allem kommt mir diese Klarnamengeschichte vor wie eine Frage der Sozialisation. Dahinter steht die Frage ""Wer ist das eigentlich, der dieses Zeug schreibt?"". Und bereits diese Frage ist falsch. Das ist genau eins der Dinge, die ich am Internet GUT finde. Dein Doktortitel ist mir genauso egal, wie dein Street-Cred im Düsseldorfer Ghetto.

In the past it was more or less clear from pre-election polls which way the wind was blowing, but now the political situation is somewhat muddy. The reason is the same kind of voter fatigue that seems to mar the political landscape of virtually all of Eastern/Central Europe these days, which is largely driven by the general disillusionment with all mainstream political parties. 

Still, if I had to wager a guess, I would be very surprised if the Communists managed to pull off a return to power. The power base has been eroded by suicidal internal wrangling, the abandonment of the party by many ethnic Romanians/Moldovans, and the disappearance of part of their electorate, which mainly consisted of grumpy pensioners nostalgic for the USSR. Even if most Moldovans are by no means staunchly pro-Western, it still looks as though the nominally pro-EU parties will have the upper hand. Ultimately the question will be how the post-electoral negotiations will go and whether the current coalition can survive the horse-trading that will follow. 

However, in light of the obvious reality that the Communists are clearly stagnating, the fact that most young people are solidly (and many passionately) pro-EU, and that Moldova is finally making meaningful progress towards EU integration while Russia has acted like the crazy neighbor who lets their dog take a shit on your front yard and then threatens to stab you when you say something, I would be very surprised to see a pro-Russian government emerge.",0,1417289889,null,0,1417290110,0,cmgbjkv,t3_2nrwfp,t1_cmgbjkv,t3_2nrwfp,null,1425767262,22,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,22

Depends on the situation

For example, I have no problem handing over my quite sensitive credit card details to some random company on the internet, but I wouldn't share those details with my close friends.

We voluntarily give unecrypted and sensitive information all the time to private companies - Banks, ISPs, online forums, countless online companies like Paypal, Amazon, Facebook, etc, etc, despite the fact that in the past such companies have leaked this information, lost it to hackers or sold the information onwards

I'd be much more concerned with my family/friends reading my personal emails than some government security unit reading/analysing it as metadata to prevent terrorist attacks

Likewise I am not concerned with being filmed - when it's being done by CCTV in a supermarket

Nor am I concerned with a stranger going through every one of my personal items - when I am going through an airport

I'm not concerned with a private profit-making company knowing every single transaction I make - when it's my bank

and to make my point: I don't mind my government (I live in a first world country) going through my meta-data to prevent/prosecute potential extremists/plots

I am concerned about my privacy, but in a common sense rational way.

To me keeping a combination of these party's in power means voting for the more of the same as regards where Ireland is going and they will be sure to follow orders and ratify TTIP when it comes to putting it through the Dáil and that's whey they wont be getting even a mention on my ballot.

And those who speak Russian as a native language and follow Russian news and feel pro-Russian, well, it seems like a more logical party then.

I'll copy my response from another time when I was recently asked about this:

Originally, I made the subreddit as a joke, after watching [this speech](http://webtv.un.org/search/vladimir-lupan-moldova-on-ukraine-security-council-media-stakeout-3-march-2014/3287925739001?term=moldova&amp;sort=date) live while chatting in the #UkrainianConflict IRC. It came on after the Ukrainian ambassador spoke, and everyone was like ""wait, wtf? Why is *Moldova* speaking? Why do we care?"" And he was talking about various forces being on ""high alert"" and so we were laughing about Moldova being on high alert (spoiler: he doesn't actually say that).

So then I made ""MoldovanCrisis"" as sort of a play on ""UkrainianConflict"", but obviously exaggerated. Then I started actually learning a bit more, as I sought out any Moldovan news and coverage I could find, and I learned about it really is critically important in the area, and how the situation in Ukraine really does affect it more than any other foreign nation. [This speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y1--SEVZ6I&amp;feature=share) by Iurie Leanca, then and current Prime Minister, speaking in English in Washington, D.C. during the beginning of the Crimean situation, really struck me. I gained a great sympathy for the country and admiration for the leadership.

And addition now: Tasty wine, good internet, favorable exchange rate. It seems like a great place to move in my opinion. Although of course I need the right outcome in these elections for that to continue, as I wouldn't feel comfortable under a Russian domination. I've wanted out of the US for a long time for many reasons, but the response I got when I was foolish enough to bring the subject up to anyone in the US was always ""well yeah, but where is better?"" as if there weren't plenty of countries which didn't have the various issues that annoyed me.

I don't want to derail into my issues with my country. But I have great respect for the courage and strength that neutrality requires in Moldova's position and I greatly look forward to visiting and seeing if the country is as welcoming as I hope and has as much potential as I believe.

I think of it a bit from an investing perspective, with ""buy low and sell high"" and all that: I think the poverty represents great potential for growth because it is a people that value education and have a lot to offer.

They will sometimes throw us in jail. Although sometimes I think my country pushes back a bit too hard (US) for some cases. Bill Clinton was personally part of the negotiations to keep that US citizen from being caned for spray painting all those cars in Singapore. That was *far* too many resources spent to keep some disrespectful asshole from getting the punishment the law called for, and what would have happened to an ordinary Singaporean. 

I met an American guy selling weed in Hanoi that was kicked out of Korea (and banned from reentry for life) for the same thing. He would keep his bowl and pot out in the open on a table on the side of the street. Keep in mind these countries have far worse punishments for drugs than the West. In all fairness he pays bribes to police as well, but he even said he has much more leeway because he is American. 

Westerners that use their passports as shields are some of the most arrogant people I have met, and it really bugs me how much they can get away with sometimes. That said, many of SA's punishments are backwards and barbaric. Sorry for the rant.

&gt; Is it illegal to download youtube videos ?

It's against YouTube's terms of service. I've seen German lawyers argue that YouTube's ToS are incompatible with German law and therefore don't apply, but until there's a ruling on a test case (to my knowledge there hasn't been), that's not a definite.

It may be a violation of copyright law, but again, some German lawyers argue that it's not if it's for personal use. Others argue that it's always copyright infringement.

Basically... there are a lot of uncertainties, and you'll always find some argument to support whatever opinion you're happiest with.

Probably the most important thing, though, is publishing on the net information that may positively identify an individual (unless you have their express permission). This is a murky area, because this is basically about the conflict between your right to free speech, and other people's constitutional right to privacy. This means, as in so many areas of German law, it's difficult to give anything but the vaguest of guidelines.

This mostly involves uploading videos. Basically, if you're out in a public place and you point your camera at something, and there are people randomly standing around or walking into shot, that's fine (or at least mostly fine). But if you deliberately focus on one person or a small number of people, you must either obtain their permission before you upload the video, or you must conceal their identity. I have seen lawyers argue that a group of at least 5 people is always legal and anything smaller is always illegal without permission; and I have seen other lawyers argue that the number of people in shot is completely irrelevant. So far, I have never had any problems with this.

Dashcams, by the way, are not actually illegal (contrary to popular belief), but it may, at least in some circumstances, be illegal to upload footage from a dashcam, and evidence obtained from dashcam footage may be ruled inadmissable, which pretty much renders them pointless.

Many Germans firmly believe that if you have a website, you must write a disclaimer saying that you are not responsible for the content of any sites you link to. This is so false it's almost completely backwards: the court ruling in that case was that you cannot place links to content you know is defamatory and then avoid a lawsuit simply by claiming you're not saying any of it is true -- if you know it's defamatory (i.e. untrue and damaging to somebody's reputation), you shouldn't be linking to it in the first place.

But you can't view the easy credit and subsequent management of the bust independently from the eurozone's structure. The easy credit came because of the eurozone and the inability to manage the bust was also because of the eurozone. Sure, you can put some blame on Spanish politicians for joining the eurozone or for not managing the bubble and so on, but you can't avoid the fact that the role of the eurozone was instrumental in Spain's downfall. 

&gt; The ""pivotal role"" is severely overestimated in my opinion.

Except it was no secret that the eurozone was an incomplete monetary union, since it was lacking a lender of last resort and/or a surplus recycling mechanism. This is mainstream economics that was known in policy circles since the 70s, not some radical stuff I came up with. Maybe you should do some reading before forming an opinion like that. 

Your logic is backwards. You find individual characteristics of specific countries and then claim ""Aha! I knew it! It was the individual characteristics that independently caused almost the exact same symptoms in a bunch of countries in the eurozone but nowhere else"".

&gt; Yes, however, how do you determine the difference?

I actually don't know. Maybe if the person commits a crime and have a judgement, he fits in what I said.

&gt; I didn't mention to throw out people that already have a citizenship or work here. Just the people that are now in refugee shelters awaiting further decision or arrive in the future.

Well, while you have a point there (that I don't agree), I think these ppl were trying to have a good and normal life, couldn't and then came here trying to have a better life. Throwing them back to those places is a sentence to death in some cases. They would come back. Even with the fortress idea you gave, I think they would risk to come back. Today, here is better for them, this is a fact.

&gt; Africa and the Middle East is as much our problem as the worlds'. It's our own problem from the moment we let an entire exodus of Africans and Easterners inside.

Agreed. We are all humans, so we all need to do an effort to help each other. Actually, I think we have the conditions, technology and knowledge. I just don't know why we didn't achieved it yet. Or I'm just a dreamer, heh.

&gt; By taking in these refugees, we strip north-Africa/M-E of their future. 

True. It is their future that is coming here. They should've invested in their younger generation (something EU leaders didn't at home).


&gt; Italy for example, with record unemployment, a government until it's lips in debts and deficits can't take in thousands of migrants. You don't have work for them, you don't have money for them.

Sad, but true. Here we have a problem with a corrupt and 'slow' government. It is a mess. Then, many refugees from Morocco and north Africa in general and we don't have conditions to put them in the workforce because our economy is at a slow pace.

false,Taenk,GERM,"For a democratic, European confederation","Extremely short summary of Germany's pension system: If you are not self-employed you are forced to participate in the federal pension system by giving a percentage of your income, your employer has to subsidise. You can voluntarily contribute more and you can participate if you are self-employed. During your paying phase you earn points depending on how high your income is relative to the average participant. All the money is immediately paid out to the receivers. At the end of your pay-in phase you receive money according to a rule that incorporates the points you earned and the current average wage of the people participating. Some modifications apply such as parents who took time off to care for children, people caring for sick relatives and adults still in school receiving points ""for free"" to compensate for them not working.

Beyond this there is the *betriebliche Altersvorsorge* where an employer offers to pay into a private pension fund reducing paid out income and thereby reducing taxes and welfare payments for both employer and employee. If this is not offered, you as an employee have no option to enact this by yourself. Alternatively and in combination you can put money privately in a fund in the *Riesterrente* scheme, which basically is a tax-deferred account that can earn interest with a guaranteed interest on it, but you can only participate if you already participate in the mandatory pension scheme. In exchange you get some subsidy from the state to incentivise you. Finally there is *Rürup* intended for self-employed people, again a tax-deferred fund that can earn interest with some more subtle differences to *Riester* making neither of them perfect to my understanding.

If you care to read more about it, I refer you to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensions_in_Germany). The whole damn thing could be a lot easier if there was only one tax defered account to pay into with the option to invest the money into virtually any vehicle, making it inheritable, guaranteeing a minimum interest equal to inflation, and forcing a rest of life insurance on the thing.

Par exemple, les Australiens gèrent une petite cagnotte d'environ 1.9 trilliards de dollars d'actifs. Même si leur population venait a vieillir, le système resterait viable, car beaucoup d'actifs sont investis a l'étranger, ce qui permet de diminuer le risque (diversification) et de rechercher de la croissance.

If we're going to talk about people with a careless grasp on history than why don't we start on the countless sub cultures and young people across Britain and Ireland who continue to romanticise the IRA?

We are almost running at record highs of net migration, most of it coming from the EU, pitting ordinary people against each other in a battle for basic resources. 1/4 a million a year is not sustainable, and all the trends point to it only soaring in the short term due to the perilous condition of the Southern Eurozone economies. There are literally tens of millions of young people all over the Eurozone with no future outside of emigration. Please actually look at the facts yourself before you go off trying to court validation from progressive Europhiles on reddit :)

edit: if you don't mind me asking .. we are running at 260,000 a year net, with zero quality control. At what point do you think this number would be too much, and whatever it is, do you think we should actually do something about it before we reach that figure?

So with this in mind, my list of countries will probably be a bit wonky to y'all. When we're evaluating places to live, this is what we look for: 

* Country has its shit together 
* Cost of living is cheap compared to our wages.
* International schools in the area are good, pay well, and there's a chance for career progression.
* Religious fundamentalism is not a mainstream thing (so pretty much no countries where Islam is the dominant religion except possibly Indonesia and Malaysia. No Turkey either for different reasons, but that's another story). 
* Continental Climate


So, with that in mind, here's my list: 

**Best:**

* **Romania**. All the points listed above, plus good internet, language is easy to pick up (to a point) and the people are super chill. If we didn't have personal beef with our jobs, we'd stay here indefinitely. Seriously. 
* **Bulgaria**. Cheaper cost of living than Romania, interesting history, but not too many international schools. 
* **Poland**. More expensive than Romania or Bulgaria, but quite a few international schools scattered throughout the country. I visited with a half-Polish friend and stayed with her grandparents, liked what I saw. 

**Worst:**

* **France**: The bulk of the international schools are in Paris, and there's no way in hell you can save money on an international teacher's salary there. 
* **Norway**: I loved visiting and recommend that everyone does. But the quality of the food (especially produce) in supermarket is bad and the cities are...blah. Yes, we're well aware of the awesome social system based on high-minded egalitarianism and a fuck ton of oil and think it is awesome. But not awesome enough to drive us to make desperate posts in /r/Norway asking how we could possibly get a job on the land of brown cheese and Nugati. 
* **UK**: My SO is English. When I told him what I was posting, he insisted that I put UK as worst. Personally, I love visiting. British culture is the best culture. The food is tremendously underrated. But the political climate, education ""reforms"", prices rising faster than wages, and ridiculous property prices keep from wanting to live there permanently. Plus my in-laws are the most dysfunctional family I have ever met IRL, and neither of us want to be obligated to visit them more than once a year.   
* **Russia**: Most of the international schools are in Moscow, which is apparently hella expensive. Restaurants are supposed to be extremely expensive for what you get. Imported foods are obviously going to be even more expensive. Dat political situation. ",0,1417308237,null,0,false,0,cmgjr0i,t3_2ns9nb,t1_cmgjr0i,t3_2ns9nb,null,1425763352,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

- Portugal could take Extremadure and Galizia; they are pretty much the same culturally.

Lastly: Whether Transnistria being given to the Moldovan SSR in the first place was legit, considering that the whole thing was a dictatorship, is questionable.

That's not to say that I'd think Transnistria, of all possible possibilities, joining the Russian Federation would be a good idea, or tenable in any way. 

Independence, Romania/Moldovia, Ukraine, or a combination of the last two are options that aren't completely insane. But I don't think the latter are going to happen any time soon, and, well, the first one is the status quo.

Honestly, I think the best idea is to pretend it doesn't exist and just ignore it, for the next decade or two: When things have settled down a bit, a tenable solution might be closer. They're not actually devolving in democracy and human rights terms, either... which is why I was so confused when they suddenly talked about joining Russia. Maybe they just want to scare us.

It starts with Christmas Eve (December 24th, despite being an Orthodox Christian country), which is as important as Christmas day in Bulgaria. A special diner, consisting of an odd number of dishes is prepared. All of them are without meat and each of them represents a separate month of the year (this is not mandatory though). The dishes consist of beans, different kinds of nuts (usually walnuts), dried plums, cakes, and the traditional [Banitsa](http://www.banici.net/banica.jpg). Another custom is the baking of a traditional round loaf ([пита, pita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pita)), in which a coin is hidden and then the pita is broken into pieces by the head of the family and a piece is given to each family member. Whoever gets the coin, s/he will have the luck, health and prosperity in the coming year. We often put more luck items in the banitsa, so that most of the people can get their chance. We write little notes with good wishes which, wrapped in aluminum foil we put in the banitsa before baking.

We also have a special *kompot* from boiled dried fruits /plumps, apples, pears and apricots/ with lemon and spices. We also drink airan – a drink from *real* Bulgarian yoghurt mixed with water and a bit of salt. Adults drink red wine or rakia. For a dessert we have fruits and a kind of pastry soaked in a very sweet syrup.

On this day the whole family gathers, eat on straw and get off the table at the same time, then the oldest person in the family has to spread frankincense anywhere to rip bad spirits out of the house and garden (a Pagan, pre-Christian tradition). The Christmas Eve dinner table doesn't get cleared until the next morning to provide sustenance for the ghosts of ancestors, who may come back to visit before Christmas morning (also a Pagan tradition).

At midnight on Christmas Eve:

* there come [koledari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koledari) - a group of young, unmarried boys lead by an elder, who together go from house to house through villages. These groups of carolers are typically dressed in traditional costumes, which [vary from region to region](https://www.google.bg/search?q=%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=jbu&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Emp6VOWSH8TVygP4-IDADA&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ).

* a [budnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_budnik) is set alight, which is a log that is believed to posses special healing powers, and the ritual includes songs and uttering of wishes as the log is lit. Sometimes the fire could be put off using wine in the morning.

As in other countries, a Christmas tree is typically set up and the entire house is decorated and presents are being opened in the morning. The local name of Santa Claus is Dyado Koleda (Дядо Коледа, ""Grandfather Christmas""). 

On Christmas day (December 25th), we are allowed to eat meat. Traditionally, families get together around the fire and make wishes for the following year while consuming blood sausages made of pork. An enormous dinner is enjoyed in the evening with a non-vegetarian main dish, usually pork or turkey.

&gt; SPIEGEL: How eager was the NSA back then to collect data?

&gt; Eichner: **Even then, they wanted to know everything, but they didn't have all of the technical abilities to collect and process it all.**

&gt; SPIEGEL: Did the revelations from Edward Snowden surprise you?

&gt; Eichner: The NSA's approach didn't surprise me. Intelligence agencies want to know everything. **But the vast scope of NSA surveillance surprised me.**

A smile spread across his face.**

I never said I was ""educated"". Although I *have* received an education, so I guess you could call me that. I'm flattered! Do you genuinely believe that tabloids like the Mail, Express, and Sun haven't played *any* part by stirring up xenophobic crap about immigration over the years? These newspapers, day-in-day-out, scaremonger by vastly exaggerating any negative effects of immigration, painting immigrants and asylum seekers as scroungers/lazy/criminal/scum, and deliberately ignoring every single piece of evidence that tells us foreign workers make a great contribution to our economy, society, and health service.

&gt; *Interesting how it's only become a big issue and the press are now actually discussing it now it's middle class white collar workers that are facing increased job insecurity,*

The tabloid press have been ""discussing"" it for years and years. What's happened now is that UKIP have successfully hyped people up into a mass-panic about foreigners coming here to take your jobs, and the media has gone along for the ride.

&gt; *a rapid increase in difficulty in getting decent housing, more competition for school places, hospital services, poor infrastructure.*

Where would we be without the contribution immigrants make to, for example, the NHS? Guess what, we'd be screwed. Our health service, along with many other industries, *relies* on Johnny foreigner from the EU and elsewhere to function. We do have a shortage of decent housing, school places, and solid infrastructure. I agree. **The answer to this is to build more houses, improve the education system, and invest more in roads/trains/etc. NOT to kick everybody out the country.** Government has failed us, not immigrants.

&gt; *Average wages in UK 5-6 times higher than averages wages in Romania/Bulgaria. Minimum wages paint an even starker picture, with these two countries have 7 or 8 times lower gross minimum wage than the UK*

No offence, but I'm perfectly aware wages are much higher here and in Western Europe than the poorest Eastern European countries. This is hardly news to anyone.

* Now, here are some facts:

&gt; The positive net fiscal contribution of recent immigrant cohorts (those arriving since 2000) from the A10 countries amounted to almost £5bn, while the net fiscal contributions of recent European immigrants from the rest of the EU totalled £15bn. Recent non-European immigrants’ net contribution was likewise positive, at about £5bn. Over the same period, the net fiscal contribution of native UK born was negative, amounting to almost £617bn.

&gt; Immigrants who arrived since 2000 were 43% less likely than natives to receive state benefits or tax credits. They were also 7% less likely to live in social housing.

&gt; European immigrants who arrived since 2000 are on average better educated than natives (in 2011, 25% of immigrants from A10 countries and 62% of those from EU-15 countries had a university degree, while the comparable share is 24% among natives) and have higher employment rates (81% for A10, 70% for EU-15 and 70% for UK natives in 2011).

&gt; The value of the education of immigrants in the UK labour market who arrived since 2000 and that has been paid for in the immigrants’ origin countries amounts to £6.8bn over the period between 2000 and 2011. By contributing to ‘pure’ public goods (such as defence or basic research), immigrants arriving since 2000 have saved the UK taxpayer an additional £8.5bn over the same period.

&gt; Considering all immigrants who were living in the UK over the years between 1995 and 2011, a period over which the net fiscal contribution of natives was negative (and accumulated to about £591bn), EEA immigrants contributed 10% more than natives (in relative terms), while non-EEA immigrants’ contributions were almost 9% lower. 

&gt; Over the same period from 1995 to 2011, immigrants who lived in the UK endowed the UK labour market with human capital that would have cost about £49bn if it were produced through the UK education system, and contributed about £82bn to fixed or ‘pure’ public goods.

Le FN n'a plus grand chose de libéral. Yep. C'est ce que je dis, MLP est profondément étatiste, c'est écrit partout sur les programmes du FN depuis qu'elle est la patronne. J'ai dis le contraire ? Nope.

Mais il existe une tendance économiquement libérale dans le FN, elle a toujours existé, et c'est même par là que JMLP à fait ses débuts politiques, contre les impôts et la dépense publique. Je te concède que le terme ultra libéral est ici excessif et galvaudé. Mais prétendre que le FN n'est pas et n'a jamais été libéral c'est du gros bullshit. Va lire les programmes de 74 à 2002. Après bien sûr, le FN des débuts c'était un gros patchwork ou effectivement, Jean Marie en bon poujadiste fait un mélange bâtard et oxymorique entre libéralisme et corporatisme (Moins d'impôts, moins de dette, moins de dépenses, mais protectionnisme pour les commerçants, moins de concurrence de l'Etat, mais pas de concurrence par les grandes entreprises non plus, en gros populisme de classe moyenne). Ma deuxième erreur était de dire que  Gollnisch était l'héritier de cette tendance. En fait le vrai grand promoteur de la tendance libérale-pour-les-petits-commerçants c'était Mégret. J'ai mélangé l'un pour l'autre. Mea Culpa. Ça n'empêche pas que tu te gourres. 

Voilà en interview à paris match ce que Mégret à a dire du FN moderne :

&gt; PM: Le vote FN est-il aujourd’hui un vote d’adhésion, comme l’assurent ses dirigeants ?
&gt;
&gt; BM: Il y a une adhésion aux thèses traditionnelles sur la question de la sécurité et de l’immigration, c’est clair. Au delà, je ne le pense pas. Sur la question de l’économie ou celle de l’Europe, le projet du FN manque de crédibilité.
&gt;
&gt; PM: Marine Le Pen, elle, a développé un discours beaucoup plus étatiste et antilibéral…
&gt;
&gt; BM : Le FN actuel, c’est le discours ancien de Jean-Marie Le Pen réorienté à gauche sur le plan économique. Moi je pense qu’il faut s’intéresser surtout à la situation des classes moyennes. La France, ce n’est pas seulement les classes défavorisées du nord de la France. C’est d’abord une majorité d’artisans, de chefs de petites entreprises, de cadres, de membres des professions libérales qui créent la richesse et qui sont systématiquement pénalisés.

Mais même si Gollnisch aussi ce fait plus étatiste ces derniers temps (la mode que voulez vous). Il garde lui aussi un fond libéral, puisque c'est un vieux du FN qui a connait les programmes d'avant Marine la preuve dans cette interview très récente pour Atlantico :


&gt; Atlantico :Dans le programme actuel de Marine Le Pen il est question de rehausser le niveau des bas salaires, de baisser de 5 % les prix du gaz, de l’électricité et du train, d’encadrer les taux des crédits à la consommation et des crédits immobiliers, de réinstaurer le protectionnisme aux frontières, ou encore de rétablir  l’équilibre entre grande distribution et commerce indépendants. Adhérez-vous pleinement à ce projet, qui a l’air de donner davantage la part belle à l’étatisme qu’à une économie libérale ?
&gt; 
&gt; Bruno Gollnisch: Moi, je connais le programme du Front National. Cela ne veut pas dire que je ne fais pas attention à celui de Marine Le Pen, mais je préfère rester prudent, car les mesures que vous pourriez me citer pourraient dans certains cas n’être que des vœux, et ne pas encore avoir été chiffrées. A cet égard je regrette une chose, c’est que notre Congrès n’ait pas pour but de mettre à jour notre programme, même s’il est vrai – et c’est l’argument de Marine Le Pen d’ailleurs – qu’en moins de 48h ce serait assez difficile à faire. Pour le moment, le programme du FN reste inchangé.
&gt; 
&gt; Les propositions que vous citez me paraissent en tout cas raisonnables, et plutôt que d’étatisme je parlerais d’Etat régulateur, car nous nous prononçons en faveur de la restauration des libertés économiques pour supprimer un certain nombre de carcans fiscaux et bureaucratiques qui pèsent sur la libre entreprise en France.
&gt; 
&gt; Pour autant, nous ne voulons pas laisser les salariés sans aucune garantie face à des comportements capitalistiques absolument cyniques. J’ai bataillé toute ma vie contre l’arbitraire administratif et bureaucratique, y compris comme avocat, ce qui ne m’empêche pas de dire que le capitalisme français, qui est en réalité un capitalisme d’État lorsque l’on voit que les patrons sont la plupart du temps des hauts fonctionnaires politisés qui ont été nommés à leur place par la faveur du pouvoir en place, n’est pas sain.
&gt; 
&gt; L’idée consistant à faire six milliards d’économies en s’attaquant aux notaires ou aux pharmaciens ne rapportera en réalité pas un centime ; si l’on veut faire ces économies, il n’y a qu’à aller les chercher dans ce que les États-Unis viennent de voler à la BNP, dans le silence le plus total des autorités françaises. En revanche si on autorise la vente de médicaments dans les supermarchés, ce sera la mort de beaucoup de pharmacies installées dans de petites communes. Nous sommes pour les libertés économiques, mais un certain nombre de correctifs sont à apporter.
&gt; 
&gt; Atlantico : **Pourtant on trouve un côté très « planificateur » dans ce programme de Marine Le Pen. Cela n’est pas incompatible avec les orientations de Jean-Marie Le Pen, qui en 2007 s’inscrivait contre l’étatisme, et voulait supprimer 50 % des subventions publiques aux entreprises ?**
&gt; 
&gt; Bruno Gollnisch : **Si tel était le cas ce devrait être corrigé, mais ce n’est pas mon impression pour le moment. Je dirais que ses proposition s’inscrivent dans un colbertisme de bon aloi, mais il ne faut pas que cela aille au-delà, c’est certain.** 

On sent bien le mec qui est coincé entre deux discours, le vieux, contre la dépense et les impôts et le nouveau pour un Etat hyper interventionniste. 

Interview qui se résume en pratique à cette phrase : ""Nous sommes pour les libertés économiques, mais un certain nombre de correctifs sont à apporter."" Et effectivement c'est pas de l'ultra-libéralisme (Qui existe, c'est l'idée que l'Etat doit être complètement exclu de la boucle, c'est la traduction en France de ce que les américains appellent l'anarcho-capitalisme), mais que voulez vous, les temps changent. 

En gros, tu as semi-raison, raison quand tu dis que le FN n'est pas et n'a jamais été ultralibéral. Tord quand tu dis que le FN n'a rien de libéral (A côté de la plaque déjà sur la lecture de mon post qui comparait deux visions au sein du FN). Le FN à une tendance libérale, mais celle-ci est mêlée à du populisme pour leurs soutiens originaux les commerçants de classe moyenne-haute. Et comme je le notais moi même dans mon post que tu as du lire de travers, cette tendance à perdu la guéguérre en 2011, quand MLP à pris le pouvoir. Mais Jean Marie était toujours le mec qui prônait encore en 2007 dans son programme ceci : 

&gt; METTRE LA LIBERTÉ AU SERVICE
&gt; DE LA PROSPÉRITÉ
&gt; Notre objectif est d’assainir l’économie et d’obtenir une réduction du chômage, une
&gt; augmentation de la richesse et une monnaie nationale considérée. **Pour atteindre ce but,
&gt; il faut faire bénéficier les Français d’un allégement massif des ponctions fiscales et
&gt; sociales et réduire les dépenses publiques en prohibant les déficits budgétaires.**
&gt; Cela implique prioritairement une réforme fiscale d’envergure. Elle portera tant sur la
&gt; fiscalité des personnes physiques que sur la promotion de l’épargne du plus grand
&gt; nombre et la fiscalité des activités en tenant compte de leur taille (artisanat, agriculture,
&gt; PME...).
&gt; La poursuite des déficits budgétaires – encore supérieurs à 200 milliards de F. pour le
&gt; seul État – , a pour conséquences le maintien à un haut niveau des prélèvements
&gt; obligatoires et le recours massif à l’emprunt par le Trésor public qui détourne l’épargne
&gt; de l’investissement. En outre, le financement de la dette publique à hauteur d’un quart
&gt; par des “non-résidents”, est une menace sur notre indépendance nationale. **Le recul de
&gt; l’étatisme confortera la souveraineté de la France** dont la monnaie – le Franc – doit
&gt; demeurer un des symboles.
&gt; Jusqu’ici, les “privatisations” ont surtout consisté à transformer un monopole de droit

false,xu85,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Nobody said anything about kicking anybody out of the country. And this ""immigration is a net benefit since 2000"" figure comes about because migrants are young, fit and driven. When they get old they require a lot more spending, they have families, kids, need schools hospitals. The tax take isn't enough to build a new city the size of Birmingham every 4 years. Even if we built houses, they need jobs there, amenities, roads, schools, desirable location, etc etc. So what do we do then, import more migrants from new EU counties like Ukraine and Turkey? Plus, here's the kicker. It isn't all about economics and pure GDP growth. It's also about community cohesion. But hey, because I can't measure this with sources, statistics and evidence and link them to you on reddit, feel free to disregard this and stick to solid numbers like the autist you seem to be. This isn't about ""winning the argument"" either, you child. It's about numbers.

What's clear is that there is a disconnect between what one group of people want and what another want. You think the argument over immigration is something to be ""won"", like an argument about the reasons for the American civil war or the Great Schism. In order to support your argument, you provide ""sources"", namely studies that show that immigration has improved our GDP. OK, that's fair enough. Now you come up against someone who is against immigration, and when he wants to put forward his side all he has to say is ""my area has changed for the worse, it's harder to find work, housing costs are too high"". Suspicion is automatically cast on his points, and indirectly his character, because he hasn't provided you with quantitative data. Academically educated people always favour quantitative data over qualitative, but nevertheless you take him on on his points because you sympathise with his view. You provide a reputable source that says actually, unemployment has been falling for the last 36 months. You point him to government figures that say house building is up 20%. Because you have hard numbers at your disposal, you walk away thinking you have won the argument. But there is much, much more to this argument than GDP figures and other metrics. How do you put a value on things community cohesion? The really tragic thing is, because this can't be measured and quantified, it's dismissed in the national debate. Politicians don't like it - why? Because they can't point to a ""14% increase in community cohesion"" across the despatch box during PMQs. They can't use it as a metric to ""prove"" they are succeeding in their job. Their only concern seems to be how to look good in the short term and get re-elected for another term.

And if you don't mind .. you haven't addressed my point. We're at 260,000 a year, and in the immediate short term it's a net benefit to our economy according to your sources. Would you be OK with that number being 350,000 a year? 450,000? It could be done. Houses can be further partitoned, migrants can sleep 3 to a room. I mean, shit, if I was earning 8x my salary I'd put up with it. And .. at 450,000, David Cameron proudly points you to his growth statistics and says ""good news everyone, we've had 3 quarters of 2% growth"" and is all smiles..

In your opinion what point do you cap the inflow? I already know your answer. It's when you have children and want to raise a family and find you can't afford a nice place to live, even on your decent salary. It's when can't save enough to send your kids to a private school, so he gets put in a class of 35 kids, 40% of whom English is a second language, hampering his educational learning ability. It's when you have to wait 2 weeks to see a GP, and years to get surgery. It's when you see an increase in homeless on the streets *in your neighbourhood*. Of course .. if any of this information is given to you third hand via a newspaper, you can dismiss it as *stirring up xenophobia* or whatever.

Im Interview kommt die Forderung nach einem durchlässigeren Bildungssystem auf. Dem stimme ich zu. Aber würde das etwas an dem angesprochenem Problem ändern? ich bezweifle es. Ich verstehe das ""jeder"" versucht zu studieren. In technischen Berufen kann man noch recht gute Abstufungen machen zwischen Ausbildungsberufen und einem Studium. Das ist in vielen Bereichen aber nicht so möglich. Dort versauert man im schlimmsten Fall in seinem Beruf weil man kaum Aufstiegsmöglichkeiten hat. Oder es gibt sogar nichts vergleichbares zum Studium. Das betrifft die meisten nicht-technischen Berufe. 

Was sollen Menschen machen für deren Interessen und/oder Begabungen es keine passenden Ausbildungsberufe gibt? Wie gesagt bei technischen Fächern lässt sich das noch leichter machen. Statt Informatik wird man Fachinformatiker. Statt Elektrotechnik zu studieren lernt man Elektroniker, macht vielleicht noch seinen Techniker später. Wie sieht es bei Politikwissenschaft, Soziologie, Kunst, Geschichte, Geologie, etc. aus? Da wird es bedeutend schwieriger. Und jeder hat meiner Meinung nach das recht glücklich zu werden. Das geht nur wenn der Beruf passt.

Ein Problem ist meiner Meinung nach die Fixierung auf ""Abschlüsse"". Es sollte mehr Möglichkeiten geben das Menschen eine Stelle übernehmen können wenn sie die Fähigkeiten dazu haben. Jemand hat die nötigen Programmierkenntnisse für einen Job? Gebt ihm/ihr eine Chance und eine faire Bezahlung. Jemand hat sich Buchhaltung selbst beigebracht und kann das zeigen? Gebt ihm/ihr eine Chance und faire Bezahlung.

Das deutsche Ausbildungssystem hat viel Gutes. Aber es ist halt am besten auf Wirtschaft und Technik spezialisiert. Das lässt viele Menschen außen vor. Und da ist es kein wunder das diese ihr Heil im Studium suchen.

There are huge gaping financial holes growing and suicidal policies being taken. There is no growth nor prospects of growth and capital is being siphoned out by the billions. The Union should be called the German Empire, because that's what it is. A realization of German ambitions and designs.

And from there, Europeans will return to their natural state, either foxed in a trench somewhere or in some concentration camp. 

As for your questions, wealth will be wiped almost overnight in some countries. Massive damages will be inflicted to European societies, starting in the periphery but progressing inwards. Other countries will take off with ownership of the goods and profit immensely, shielding themselves from the starving hoards. This will lead to conflict with other foreign powers competing for debt repayments. A sort of picking off spoils from a corpse. Conflict and tension afterwards. Whoever is left will never forgive and forget.


&gt; Would European nations currently outside the EU make any gains?

I expect countries outside the financial black hole Europe to be hugely affected to the brink of intervention, probably setting up higher global tensions. From there to military escalation will be a natural step. 

The wealth gap will rise and is rising in all European societies, particularly between countries. This will reopen old wounds. After that, war and terrorism. Now on different scale. More urban and much more violent.

Eastern and Northern Europe will disappear crushed under Russian tanks and boots. Probably even irradiated by then. Nobody will do a damn thing, other than bickering and growing further apart. The US won't care about it because caring would mean global annihilation. Sure, the war will stop eventually between East and West but the tensions and a cold war will follow, *after* the Russians get what they wanted in the first place.

What reunion? The hatred that's brewing will never go away! Once this begins (again) it will not stop, ever! It will be filmed and broadcast in glorious 4k! Countries and security will disappear as quickly as food off their supermarket shelves. Violence and terrorism will be daily occurrences. Think of something similar to Germans bayoneting babies in Belgium during WWI, except now on liveleak and in 2020. Core countries will want buffer zones and will go to brutal lengths to insulate themselves. But nevermind that, they'll go as well. The future is Asian. Not American, Russian or European.

false,EB3031,native,native,"On the top of my head I can't think of any other verbs that do this but I'm pretty sure they are there. The difference is that in your first example the verb *schaffen* is a 'weak' one (it doesn't have the power to change its core when put into past or participle form). When applying the second meaning the verb is 'strong', which is why its core/the ending of the past/participle form doesn't use the normal formula.

Something similar that comes to mind is the difference between Zustandspassiv and Vorgangspassiv with certain verbs.

One I know is ""[schleifen](https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/schleifen)"".  
*schleifen/schliff/geschliffen = to sand/to polish*  
*schleifen/schleifte/geschleift = to drag something (over the floor)*  

There are most probably others, I cannot think of any though right now.  


Then there are words that change when used transitively or intransitively.  
e.g.: [erschrecken](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/erschrecken).  
*erschrecken/erschrak/erschrocken = intransitive, ""ich erschrak""*  
*erschrecken/erschreckte/erschreckt = transitive, ""ich erschreckte dich""*  
(It's a bit more complicated, but that's the gist of it.)  


Then there are words that are in varying states of changing from regular to irregular or back:  
*senden/sandte/gesandt* (""old"") = *senden/sendete/gesendet* (""new"")  ([Wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/senden))  
""backen/buk/gebackt* (""old"") = *backen/backte/gebacken* (""new"") ([Wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/backen))  
*winken/winkte/gewinkt* or *gewunken* ([Wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/winken))  


And then there's regional dialect, where quite some words are strong instead of weak, or vice versa.  
For example: *""schneien/schnie/geschnien""* instead of *""schneien/schneite/geschneit""*  ([Wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/schneien))

Peut être qu'on ne se pose juste pas la même question ;)

Donc, à part l'emploi mal à propos du terme ""libéral"", et l'emploi de cette insulte à l'intelligence qu'est l'expression ""ultra-libéralisme"", je n'ai rien à redire à ton post. 

Il y a bien une évolution au sein du FN, mais je crois qu'on est pas loin d'être d'accord sur le fait qu'il n'a jamais été un parti libéral, puisque toute entrave à la libre circulation des biens et services (travail compris) pose un problème en faussant les repères de valeur sur la base d'une limite arbitraire (frontière ou taxe).

Because the first amendment (specifically protection of the press) tradionally trumps national security law.

However, there have been plenty of calls to arrest and lock up Greenwald, as the U.S. grows increasingly totalitarian. In the UK, they would do this in a heartbeat. Greenwald's partner was arrested and harassed in London.

Greenwald didn't return to the U.S. for more than a year, fearing arrest and harassment. Several U.S. citizens have relocated abroad due to harassment. Laura Poitras and Jacob Applebaum come to mind.

Sarah Harrison can't return to the UK and now resides in Berlin together with Poitras and Applebaum.

So while we're not quite there yet, the totalitarian harassment is already happening.

Culturally is much more complex since everyone has their own definition of what European culture is. Most believe it means you must be a Christian Nation, which I don't. To me European means freedom of all types. Education, personal, social, media, religious, etc. 

Turkey is nowwhere near Bulgaria, let alone Greece on any of these freedoms. It is almost daily you hear of journalist being arrested, websites being banned, females being talked about as objects or non-humans, co-operation with Islamic terrorists who massacre all non-Muslims, etc

What is going on now is just the 1st stages of Turkey's spiral into a full  blown Islamic Era. Erdogan has set the ground-work for it and I can assure you that he does not see himself as ""European"". 

Also why didn't you just say ""Turkey is as European as Bulgaria""? That would have sounded more believable but still an idiotic thing to say if you have any concept of what European means historically to Modern times. 

Edit: I also like how you try to slander Greece in another post by saying they destroyed ""Bulgarian"" heritage sites in Greece yet you dismiss the over 5,000+ Greek/Armenian Christian heritage sites in Turkey that were destroyed and the fact they committed a genocide of over 3 million Greeks/Armenians and deny it like a sick joke. Most Turks deny the genocide because they are proud of it, not that they don't believe it never happened. 

As far as Mosques being banned . . . Greece is just ahead of everyone else, give it 50 years the rest of Europe will follow the same laws.

Moreover, I agreed with you on the issue of social impact.

If all your jobs and housing and people are in the South-East, then costs are going to be free-market regulated. The moment that becomes unsustainable then people will not get housing there, and move somewhere where they can get a better quality of life. 

However, if you want quality of life to improve, then you want immigration.You want more people to work, and produce things. If you have more things on a market then according to supply-demand, then everything will be much cheaper.Not to mention of any indirect benefits.

[magyar group announces it wants to leave government](http://www.romaniajournal.ro/udmr-quits-the-ruling-coalition-offensive-for-power-shift-officially-blast-off/) this means little for the government since the ones in power have majority. Siding with the victors is very common and we have local elections in 2 summers. I don't understand why they bothered to change culture minister. UNPR ( PSD satellite) might follow them into oppositon too and if they leave then we see change of power.

One of the excluded members has immediately started talking on TV for about 2 hours about the very crooked things Ponta's camp does. Much conflict followed after that. 2 of those removed said that the PM deliberately organised the elections badly.. this could mean prison.

Then they voted elsewhere. And despite the groupthink during the Maidan protest, Yanukovich wasn't much of a Russian lapdog until he realized that Ukraine is financially fucked without help which EU wasn't giving (and it was fucked before him, too, which is part of why he came into power). In the meantime (and before the war in Ukraine), e.g. Belarus, a staunch Russian ally, has twice the GDP per capita of Ukraine.

tl;dr: to these countries, EU is not an obvious alternative at all. They are caught in the crossfire and weak. This tears them apart.

Im Ancien Régime war auf dem Lande in Frankreich hauptsächlich die katholische Kirche für die Schulausbildung in den sog. *petites écoles* zuständig. In Übereinstimmung mit der Regierung sahen sie ihre Aufgabe darauf beschränkt, dem dritten Stand das Lesen beizubringen. 
Das war für das Empfangen von Indoktrination wichtiger als das Schreiben. 

Es war sogar erklärtes Ziel, die Hierarchie aufrechtzuerhalten, indem man die Massen weitgehend im Zustand des Analphabetismus bezüglich des aktiven Schreibens hielt. 

Die französische Revolution hat dann zumindest dazu geführt, dass die Bevölkerung während des 19. Jahrhunderts in die Lage versetzt wurde zu schreiben. Allerdings gab es auch da klare Vorgaben, auf welche Weise was zu schreiben war und was nicht. 

Die gegenwärtige Diskussion um die schärfere Kontrolle von Internetkommentaren erinnert an die Auffassung Richelieus, der das Chaos drohen sah, wenn das ganze Volk schreiben könnte und würde 

vgl. z.B. Richelieus Testament, Kap. 11, Sektion 10: 

""Ainsi qu'un corps qui aurait des yeux sur toutes ses parties serait monstrueux, ainsi un état le serait-il si tous ses sujets étaient savants; on y verrait aussi peu d'obéissance que l'orgueil et la présomption y seraient ordinaires..., le commerce de lettres bannirait absolument celui de la marchandise, ruinerait l'agriculture et désertait en peu de temps la pépinière des soldats qui s'élève plutôt dans la rudesse et l'ignorance que dans la politesse des sciences.""

But I disagree that this situation applies in France, partly because we don't have a biparty system, and also because France has reached a point where it doesn't think it needs to go more to the left. It's left/progressive enough for the most part. Anything more is seen as too much.

I think the left in France needs to shift to the right to broaden their votes to the center, or with other leftists who'd otherwise leave for the FN. The left already almost has the guaranteed vote of the far left, so it needs the center.

Strauss Kahn would have won on a landslide specifically because he seemed almost right wing. In France, we associate the right wing as the better party for the economy. Not saying it's true, I don't think it is, but that's largely how people see it. For overtly progressive arguments, people say ""that's nice"" - *pat on the head*. There's even rather a certain disdain for ""bobos"", ""bien-pensance"", and whatnot.

Overtly progressive people demonstrating for this or that may seem good and popular from your perspective, but I'd say the average Frenchman has at worst disdain for them, at best he finds them ridiculous and inadequate.

I keep talking about perspective because for me it was a shock a few years ago when I left university to the workforce. From the university, it seemed the left and progressive ideas were normal. Then I worked in businesses with people of all ages, young people too who seemed like your normal guy, many who didn't come from university, and damn, there's no comparison. And I'm not even mentioning how people feel in the countryside. Sometimes the latter may vote left in local elections, because it's better for them when it comes to social benefits, or maybe it's just that the local left wing mayor has been around since the 70s.

""Saartreue"" would be a reference to the Nazi regime's desire for the Saar area to be returned to the German Reich. After WW1 it was first put under the administration of the League of Nations, then in 1920 under French administration for 15 years, after which a referendum was to be held. At first, the Saar was all for returning to Germany until Hitler's election in 1933, when the left-wing parties changed their minds and decided they were better off with the status quo. The referendum was duly held, and ""only"" 90% of the population voted for the Saar to be returned to Germany.

The reason you won't now find Saartreue in Hamburg is that this was its Nazi-era name, and following WW2 would have been renamed (or its original name restored) along with all the Adolf-Hitler-Straße in every city.

Aggiungi +3 al fattore ""probabile inculata"" / roba caduta da un camion.

**Update:**

La partita IVA del primo sito corrisponde a Gruppo Editoriale Simone S.p.A.. (NA), [esistente](http://www.simone.it/) e che sembra tipicamente registri i suoi domini con Aruba.

Quella dell'altro sito corrisponde a Francesco Simone Acconciature, Borgomanero (NO), anche quello [esistente](http://www.francescosimone.it/).

Probabilmente hanno usato prestanome per i domini o semplicemente dichiarato il falso al Registrar.

Addizionalmente, gli indirizzi delle pagine ""Chi siamo"" non corrispondono con nessuno degli indirizzi di tutta la roba sopra.

Aggiungi +5.

**Update 2:**

Sembra che accettino Paypal per davvero, non che lo dichiarino soltanto.
Ipotesi:

* Sono niubbi della truffa
* Hanno integrato Paypal in modo che fallisca al pagamento ""Ci scusiamo per il disagio, Paypal ha dei problemi al momento, usa questo ALTRO METODO DI PAGAMENTO, ti facciamo anche uno sconto per la seccatura"".
* Stanno semplicemente raccogliendo indirizzi email e dati personali.
* Puntano sul tirare lunga la spedizione e prendere i soldi in contanti prima che l'utente richieda un rimborso a PayPal e sono contenti di prendere anche una sola vittima, ma non penso sia possibile.

**Update 3:**

Ho dimenticato di aggiungere che il nome del dominio passerà ad Apple due microsecondi dopo aver fatto un reclamo al NIC, perché viola più o meno tutti i punti del documento di risoluzione dispute.

**Update 4:**

Sembra anche che Awesome Projects SRL siano degli schifosi spammer

If you like being a social worker and organizer, ""pastor"" is *the* job, and unless you choose to reveal yourself nobody will ever know or notice you don't actually believe in the bearded guy.

Also, what I remember reading from a bishop in the Vatican about his believes sounds much, MUCH closer to what atheists would say than to what religious zealots would say. Basically, he talked about astronomy and physics, and ""god"" was a very, very ""meta"" concept based on ""god of the gaps"" (google Neil deGrass Tyson and that phrase), it had really *nothing* to do with what most religious people think. Any atheist could go out with that bishop and have no trouble with his believes.

Abstract:

&gt;Taking notes on laptops rather than in longhand is increasingly common. Many researchers have suggested that laptop note taking is less effective than longhand note taking for learning. Prior studies have primarily focused on students’ capacity for multitasking and distraction when using laptops. The present research suggests that **even when laptops are used solely to take notes, they may still be impairing learning because their use results in shallower processing.** In three studies, we found that **students who took notes on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than students who took notes longhand.** We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takers’ tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.

year still to be the first year since 1969 without issuing debts.

**Head of the Federal Bank opposes stimulus packages**

- At the Sueddeutsche Zeitung Economic Summit the head of the Federal Bank Jens Weidmann opposed stimulus packages in
the near future. The background is the hope that an improved economic situation in Germany would drag up the Eurozone.
Weidmann opposes such believes and believes spill-over effects to be minimal. The federal government announced investments
in the range of 10 Billion Euros. But neither Weidmann nor Finance Minister Schäuble call the investment a stimulus package
as its value is below 0.1% GDP. Both believe there is still more room for public investment in Germany.

**Administrative Court wants review of the changed asylum law**

- The Administrative Court in Münster wants the Constitutional Court to review the new asylum law as it has concerns that
Serbia could be considered a safe country of origin. Under asylum law a safe country of origin makes a asylum case very
difficult. The Administrative Court believes that Roma families would not return to a save environment there. With the
change in law Serbia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegobina have been declared safe countries of origin. Roma in Serbia may
be criminally prosecuted for asylum applications abroad. The concept of safe countries of origin was under heavy debate
in 1996 and may now be under new scrutiny again.

**Constitutional Court strengthens parental rights**

- In the case of a 1 year old girl the father got custody back after the child was placed in a
foster family. The parents separated recently and the mother is mentally ill and could not take
care of the child. The Youth Office judged that the father would rather use African educational methods
than Europeans and was therefore not eligible to parent his daughter. A family court upheld the decision,
but the constitutional court now ruled that the father was not met with due impartiality and that as long
as the parents do not jeopardize the physical, mental or psychological well-being of the child it was not
up to the state to interfere regardless of the preferred educational methods. The family court must re-examine
the case now.

Auch wenn wir in Vergleich zu den Amerikanern wesentlich weniger Probleme haben, ist die Gesamtsituation traurig.

Abgesehen von den Sonderrechten der Kirchen, ist es vor allem extrem schwierig sich öffentlichkeitswirksam religionskritisch zu äußern. 

Sobald sich jemand klar gegen Sonderansprüche der Religionsgemeinschaften wendet (Sonderarbeitsrecht, Kirchensteuer, Subventionen, Beschneidung, etc) muss er damit rechnen von fast allen Journalisten als entweder antisemitisch, rechtsradikal oder intolerant gebrantmarkt zu werden.

Alle Parteien, ausser der Linken, haben dezidiert kirchenfreundliche Programme oder starke parteiinterne Plattformen und es existiert keine einzige dezidiert sekulare Partei. 

Die einzige Partei die im Westen je einen strikt antikirchlichen Kurs fuhr war die FPD in den 1950 und 1960ern und auch die würden heute nie im Leben etwas gegen die Privilegien der Kirchen unternehmen.

Die Situation ist nicht wesentlich erfreulicher als in den USA und die offensichtliche demographische Entwicklung führt dazu, dass unsere politische Elite nicht etwa anfängt die Rechte der Religionen zu reduzieren, sondern im Gegenteil der zunehmenden Ausbreitung des Islam mit erneutem staatlichen Entgegenkommen reagiert. 

Öffentlich finanziertes Islamstudium und staatlich geförderter Islamunterricht in Schulen statt allgemeinverbindlichen Religionskunde- oder Ethikuntericht sind eine moralische Bankrotterklärung für jede aufgeklärte westliche Gesellschaft. Das damit begründt wird, dass man nur so Fandamentalisten in den Griff bekommt, sollte jedem rationalen Menschen die Galle schwellen lassen.

Not anymore, but when he worked for the Guardian, the Guardian was under quite a bit of pressure.

&gt; New video footage has been released for the first time of the moment Guardian editors destroyed computers used to store top-secret documents leaked by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.

http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/31/footage-released-guardian-editors-snowden-hard-drives-gchq

&gt; Cameron told MPs: ""We have a free press, it's very important the press feels it is not pre-censored from what it writes and all the rest of it.

&gt; ""The approach we have taken is to try to talk to the press and explain how damaging some of these things can be and that is why the Guardian did actually destroy some of the information and disks that they have. But they've now gone on and printed further material which is damaging.

&gt; ""I don't want to have to use injunctions or D notices or the other tougher measures. I think it's much better to appeal to newspapers' sense of social responsibility. But if they don't demonstrate some social responsibility it would be very difficult for government to stand back and not to act.""

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/david-cameron-nsa-threat-newspapers-guardian-snowden

In other words, he's saying: ""I'm a merciful man. I don't want to have to hurt you, so don't make me""

As for Greenwald, he could go to the UK, but there's no telling what would happen and he has said he won't ever go there anymore. So that means a voluntary exile from the UK.

&gt; There's only one country that has been consciously excluded from the tour – in fact, only one country in the world that Greenwald says he absolutely will not visit. It is the UK. The wounds left by the detention under the Terrorism Act of his partner, Miranda, at Heathrow airport last August, are still open and deep.

&gt; Miranda was detained on his way back to Rio on a ticket paid by the Guardian from Berlin, where he had met the filmmaker Laura Poitras, who worked with Greenwald on the NSA files. Officials claimed he was carrying 58,000 classified UK documents on a hard drive.

&gt; ""I don't trust them not to detain me, interrogate me and even arrest me. Their behaviour has been so extreme and offensive, and the political and media class was so supportive of it, that I feel uncomfortable with the entire atmosphere,"" says Greenwald.

&gt; He insists he has never had animosity towards Britain. ""But the more I've learned, the more troubling it has become.""

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/12/glenn-greenwald-uk-arrest-me-edward-snowden-nsa

Unfortunately, he's right. The UK has a history of hardcore Orwellian censorship:

&gt; English newspapers attempting proper reportage of Spycatcher's principal allegations were served gag orders; on persisting, they were tried for contempt of court, although the charges were eventually dropped. Throughout all this, the book continued to be sold in Scotland; moreover, Scottish newspapers were not subject to any English gag order, and continued to report on the affair. Quantities of the book easily reached English purchasers from Scotland, while other copies were smuggled into England from Australia and elsewhere. A notable television report at the time featured a reporter flying to Australia, then flying back into England with ten copies of the book which he declared to Heathrow airport's customs officers. After some discussion, he was allowed to continue his carriage of the books into England, as they had been given no specific instructions to confiscate them.

Contrairement aux systèmes magnétiques employées aujourd'hui, ces systèmes sont relativement peu coûteux et durable. A noter que la campagne de soutien du projet se termine bientôt sur Kickstarter.

Reste plus qu'a couvrir toutes les rues de matériaux conducteurs!

false,-_-Nope,BRUX,Brussels,"IMO, it is more than just a simple  ""communication"" / ""charisma"" issue. 


Hollande was elected as a left-wing candidate, from a left-wing party, after a left-wing campaign (albeit mostly ""center-left"" tbh). Sure, it was not his charisma nor his great ideas that got him elected, but mainly the rejection of Sarkozy.  Still. 


Yet, here we have a president doing the same things that Sarkozy did, on a social and economic level. The only two main differences being gay marriage and their respective ""styles"" (Sarkozy was particularly provocative in everything, Hollande is the opposite of provocative). 


Just like Sarkozy, Hollande slashed all public services budgets (healthcare, university, local authorities, you name it). Just like him, he handed out billions of public money to big corporations, without any counterpart from those corporations, and without any effective results. Just like him, he increased taxes on mostly everyone but the richest. Just like him, he follows blindly Germany or the US. 


Obviously, this doesn't sit well with the left-wing voters that wanted to kick out Sarkozy and his politics. They end up with a carbon copy of it. But it doesn't sit well with the right-wing voters either, for several reasons I'd guess: resentment for winning in 2012, thinking that he is not going ""far enough"", gay marriage, etc etc. I mean, Obama could hand out free guns and make bible study compulsory in schools, the conservative would still hate him anyway. 



**TL;DR:**Hollande hasn't been pursuing the politics most of his voters wanted, thus making him unpopular among the left-wing, and he is not able to gain popularity among those who didn't (and will never) vote for him either, thus staying unpopular among the right-wing.

On the other hand there are many classically trained guitarists in Italy, and they're good. Most of them will *not* play classical repertoire for a living, but will branch out in jazz and popular music.

Classical in Italy is relatively unpopular, even though there are many aficionados, *melomani* - i.e. opera fans - , orchestras and musicians.

It's hard to reach out the general public in the best of circumstances; now that musical institutions are fighting for their very existence it has become impossible.

That would be a great solution, but it doesn't happen. A few days ago for example a riot broke out in a refugees shelter here where refugees knived and stabbed each other. 

People started complaining that they shouldn't put different reglious people in one shelter as they can't live together(the fight broke out over relgious matters). Then that means they can't live here, yet some would say they should. They are not send back, and as a result the good suffer from the bad. I really can't fold my head around the idea how these people should live here in the future, while they can't even live together in a refugee shelter?

&gt; I think these ppl were trying to have a good and normal life, couldn't and then came here trying to have a better life.

Well that's in many cases not about safety and primary needs (food, clean water etc.) anymore. In my opinion, we don't have to shelter people that already have basic human needs where they come from (food, health, safety, clean water). Unless they actually make a chance here. So then we would need regulation, like only let people in who already learned the language, or have an education etc. 

&gt; Throwing them back to those places is a sentence to death in some cases. 

In some cases it is, but not in all. I'm not saying we should throw people into their dead, but a large proportion doesn't only flee for safety. And if we have to let everybody in, we might as well move the whole world here. Historically, countries remained rich and stable through contained border policies. Remove that, and a country will fall into poverty, unsafety, violence and instability, that is already happening in city;s like The Hague where ISIS for example is marching through the streets, and people start calling for an islamic caliphate in the Netherlands, and a sharia law.

It is not for fun that Stalin send colonists throughout the entire USSR to populate it with Russians, and that we used force in our colonies. Different cultures simply can't live in great numbers under the same roof. Small quantities can if they integrate in our society, but from the moment different cultural refugees cluster together and form their society within a society (something that's is happening in Europe) we better brace for bad things to happen.

&gt; Today, here is better for them, this is a fact.

But is this better on top off a sustainable life, a privilige or a basic human right? So is it a basic human right to have a flatscreen tv and a shiny car? Or is safety, food and water a basic human right? 

&gt; Even with the fortress idea you gave, I think they would risk to come back. 

Well we have guarded our borders for centuries. Now of all times it shouldn't be hard, a lot easier than 200+ years ago actually.

&gt; Actually, I think we have the conditions, technology and knowledge. I just don't know why we didn't achieved it yet. Or I'm just a dreamer, heh.

Good point, I think the world can not sustain 7+ billion people living like us. 

&gt; True. It is their future that is coming here. They should've invested in their younger generation (something EU leaders didn't at home).

Indeed, and if they can't, perhaps we should for them. A camp on the spot is just a part of that idea. As after the conflict they can go home and build the country, and not linger in refugee camps here or poverty here fr the rest of their lifes. 

&gt; Sad, but true. Here we have a problem with a corrupt and 'slow' government. It is a mess. Then, many refugees from Morocco and north Africa in general and we don't have conditions to put them in the workforce because our economy is at a slow pace. 

Indeed. And one way or the other, even if Italy would thrive now, it can not sustain entire North Africa living from it. We just have to accept the world is not the same everywhere, and we should set a clear framwork of what basic human rights are, and fight for that, but don't for ""Western welfare for all"". As we would make ourself poor to make them rich(er). And our wealth didn't fall from the sky, they can just as well build that, only they can't, or something.

The sex scandal, well, nobody cares about that, but the fact that his budget minister was frauding the fiscal administration hurt him, the controversial same-sex marriage law didn't help either, the fact that his executive and him are never on the same page makes him appear weak. He campaigned on being an exemplary person who will run an examplary governement (the famous ""moi président"" speech), on that part, he's failed completely.

I don't think we'll ever see a charismatic president ever again.

The issue isn't that previous presidents were much better but it was a different era : the government controlled the press, people had no real place to discuss things outside their friends, colleagues and family, it was hard to organize a protest if you weren't one of the biggest unions, you could silence journalists and there were so few channels that you could control everything by putting people you trust in key positions, politicians wouldn't talk much in the first place.

Nowadays you can't trust anyone, one of Sarkozy's closest advisor was audiotaping their conversation, judges are more independant than beforeand investigating everything he did, lots of sensitive informations are leaked to the press or on the Internet, people can organize a protest on Facebook, politicians are mocked on social media or twitter on a daily basis when they're not the ones posting stupid shit there and catching a lot of flak for it, everytime a politician says something, a video appears of them saying the opposite or there are dozens of journalists telling you exactly why it was stupid of him/her to say that.

Basically, they now appear as incompetent / corrupt as they have always been, they get caught with their pants down time and time again but they always come back for more, attacking their opponents instead of adressing the issues they raise, getting reelected despite having been proven guilty of corruption, they refuse to reisgn when caught in a scandal, they lie on national TV and every other politician acts like it's no big deal.

En gros, on compte ton nombre de papiers, mais les gens sont ils plus intelligents, plus performants qu'autrefois? Sans doute pas.  Simplement, *ils s'adaptent*.

On se retrouve (je suis en physique/Spi) avec des papiers cassés en plusieurs morceaux : l'information se disperse, le bruit monte, les papiers changeant juste ""alpha en bêta"" se multiplient. J'ai déjà vu des thésards chinois avec plus de 10 papiers à mi-thèse. Aha.

Si tu oses critiquer le système, les ""administratifs"" finissent par te regarder l'oeil en coin, sous entendu ""s'il critique, c'est juste qu'il n'a pas assez de papiers!""

Les experts du ministère (les ""juges"" pour les financements ANR par ex.), ceux de l'AERES (audit des laboratoires) ne veulent pas lire les papiers, c'est tellement plus simple d'avoir un indicateur : X papiers, c'est bon, Y&lt;X papiers, le labo sera classé ""B"" et n'aura que les miettes en financement.  

Le pire, c'est que maintenant on trouve des justificatifs dans la communauté. On reproche désormais la longueur des papiers jugés trop longs :""Personne ne les lit"", ""tu perds en visibilité"", etc. 
Les rapporteurs (qui jugent les papiers dans l'évaluation par pairs)  s'y mettent aussi!

Les articles passent préférentiellement dans des ""Letters"", c'est à dire un format court, pour publier rapidement un résultat. Mais ils ne sont plus jamais suivis du papier détaillé. 
Ces papiers n'expliquent plus grand chose, et se contentent d'être des rapports d'activité : ""on a fait telle manip, on a trouvé ça. Merci, au revoir""

--Digression sur le pourquoi--

En France, on sait bien pourquoi ça a été importé : on fait dire ce qu'on veut à un indicateur (alors que c'est beaucoup plus dur de critiquer un travail de fond) et on peut donc orienter le discours pour diminuer les crédits, supprimer des postes. 

J'ai assisté  à une réunion avec des politiques, qui tenaient des discours   d'une bêtise et d'un mensonge effarant à propos de la LRU devant une assemblée de chercheurs (aucun n'était dupe, et les politiques étaient contents de quitter la salle tant la tension était palpable). La mauvaise foi à l'état pur, un seul regret : que ça n'ait pas été filmé pour leur remettre devant le nez. 
Une année, le gouvernement avait annoncé +5% de budget pour les labos, mais n'y excluait pas la TVA :le budget était en fait en baisse de 15%. 

 
En cette fin 2014, des rumeurs de [non paiement des salaires en Décembre à l'université](http://www.letudiant.fr/educpros/actualite/les-universites-pourront-elles-payer-leur-salaries-en-decembre.html) circulent (après le gel des salaires depuis 2010).
Les députés ont finalement voté le versement de la dernière part, mais le défaut de crédit a été reporté à 2015, ce qui ne fait que déplacer le problème. 
On parle de sommes pourtant ridicules, la niche Copé ou le CIR sont 10 fois plus élevés, preuve que le gouvernement crée le problème de toute pièce, pour simplement appliquer à l'Université ce qu'il a fait  aux régions. 

 Les financements sur ANR ont  encore diminué par rapport au début. Les CPER (contrats état-régions) apparemment divisés par 2 ou 3 (!). 
Les crédits récurrents sont proches du néants (1000€ par personne).

Je n'ai pas vu un poste créé depuis 2007, et les labos tournent avec 3/4 de précaires payés au lance-pierre. Déjà que les salaires ne volent pas haut : un ingénieur d'étude titulaire est embauché à 1400€ (net hors prime). 
Paradoxalement, les chercheurs cumulent  beaucoup d'heures sup. en enseignement (à cause de la suppression des postes), ce qui réduit d'autant le potentiel de recherche. 

Certains doctorants ne sont même plus intéressés par les post docs, tant l'ambiance est devenue délétère dans les labos. 

Mais c'est bien connu, les banques sauveront la recherche grâce au [CIR](http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2013/09/12/la-cour-des-comptes-appelle-a-mieux-maitriser-le-cout-du-credit-d-impot-recherche_3476412_3234.html) (5.8 Md€ en 2014! Avec 6 % de ce montant, on résoud le problème de déficit de toutes les Universités.)

As a result, Hollande has suffered much more from his ""friends"" than from his enemies. The far-left deeply despises him, the Greens, more delusional than ever, openly plot against him, and even most of his fellow Socialists, like former Economics Minister Arnaud Montebourg, less-than-discreetly brief the press against him. His only powerful support in his own party right now is the current PM, Manuel Valls, whose own ambitions aren't a secret to anybody, least of all to Hollande, and who everybody (including Hollande) fully expects to stab him in the back at some moment in the next couple of years.

This lack of support has translated in legislative gridlock (does that sound familiar?) which in turn hasn't helped Hollande's popularity much.

Mind you, polls don't tell the whole story: while Hollande certainly isn't popular, he doesn't attract the same level of venom as other leading politicians. People don't like him, but neither do they loathe him, whereas Sarkozy, never mind Le Pen, are intensely hated by large portions of the population. French presidential elections are in two rounds: if nobody gets more than 50% of the vote in the first round, there is a second round between the two leading candidates. If Hollande manages to do the cut in the first round and faces either Sarkozy or Le Pen in the second, it isn't altogether unconceivable that he's re-elected. His main problem will be to get past the first round (or even to be a candidate in the first place).",0,1417351551,null,0,false,0,cmgwwdj,t3_2ntpue,t1_cmgwwdj,t3_2ntpue,null,1425757146,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

[Thread dazu in /r/syriancivilwar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/2nqo6v/isis_attacks_kobane_border_crossing_from_turkish/)

Es war ja bekannt, dass von türkischer Seite natürlich kein Finger krumm gemacht wird um den Kurden zu helfen, und dass der IS und andere Islamisten allenfalls halbherzig verfolgt werden, nicht zuletzt weil die Türkei a) Schiss vor Inlandsanschlägen hat und b) sich nicht die radikalisierten sunnitischen Gebiete zum Feind und damit zu No-Go-Areas machen will (da gibts einiges an religiös-kulturellen Hintergünden -zb heilige Stätten der türkischen Sunniten(Staatsreligion) im türkischen Ausland als potentielles Terrorziel-, aber auch ehemalige und mögliche zukünftige türkische Geiseln als Hemmfaktor).

Dass jetzt allerdings von türkischem (Grenz)Boden der Dschihad betrieben werden kann ist eine neue politische Eskalationsstufe. Es ist maximal inakzeptal und belegt die Ineffektivität und das letztendliche Scheitern der türkischen Strategie bezüglich des politischen Umgangs mit dem IS. Die Türken sollten schnellstmöglich ihre Engagement überdenken, Grenzen sichern und sich an Aktionen gegen den Dschihadismus aktiv und aggressiv beteiligen. Aussitzen und nun gar Appeasement erweisen sich als Sackgasse, wenn nicht sogar als kontraproduktiv. Wenn die Türkei nicht so blöd und starrsinnig wäre, könnte sie durch eine Allianz mit den autonomen kurdischen Gebieten im syrisch-irakischen Konflikt sogar einen langfristigen Frieden mit den Kurden einleiten.

Tl;dr: Die Türkei sollte aufhören sich mit Dschihadismus zu arrangieren. Es kann ihnen keine größeren Vor-, als Nachteie bringen. Der kurdisch-türkische Konflikt wird weder gelöst, noch wird der Dschihad die Türkei langfristig verschonen.

Ti fai un'installazione o due su macchina virtuale seguendo la guida ufficiale, e sicuramente cosi ti impratichisci con la CLI e impari i programmi/comandi più importanti.

Una volta che ti ""sei fatto le ossa"" su Arch in VM puoi fare un dual-boot con la distro che ti fare. Debian Testing è ottima, ma comunque si tratta solo di che packet manager preferisci (pacman &gt; zypper &gt; yum &gt; apt btw) e di quanto vuoi che i pacchetti siano stati testati prima di essere finiti nel repo.

Hai detto ch non hai voglia di perdere tempo ad installare Arch, ma imho è uno dei modi più veloci per imparare come funziona il sistema. Ti metti davanti al computer con una bella birretta in mano il sabato sera/la domenica pomeriggio, e se sai leggere in neanche un'ora hai finito.

Poi hai detto che ti interessa più l'ambito server, quindi inizia a giocare con quello. Puoi fare tutto in locale sul pi, oppure puoi comprarti una vps da pochi spicci al mese, come preferisci. Se non hai idee su cosa fare, prendi un servizio che usi spesso, controlla se esiste un'alternativa self-hosted e installa quello.

Americans seem to have a shared belief that merely adding viewpoints and stories to a discussion has inherent value, whereas - very generally speaking - Germans tend to think you ought to keep your trap shut if your contribution adds nothing new in the way of facts (as opposed to your personal feelings).

false,_chwax_,null,null,"Salut. Je suis de tout cœur avec toi. Je peux te donner quelques conseils relatifs à la curatelle qui ne constituent pas une consultation juridique et n'ont que la valeur de simple conseil amical entre redditeurs ;-)

On part de l'hypothèse que ta maman refuse toujours de se faire aider. On part également de l'hypothèse que tu ne mens pas sur son état de santé ...  sans quoi je te préviens que tu t'exposes à des problèmes devant la justice.  


D'abord il faut savoir qu'il y a deux régimes de protection possibles : la curatelle et la tutelle. En effet si comme tu le penses ta maman perd assez gravement la mémoire elle aura besoin d'une protection croissante de sa personne et de son patrimoine au fil de l'évolution de la maladie. Le juge décidera du régime à appliquer en fonction de la gravité diagnostiquée des troubles.

Tu dois t'adresser au juge des tutelles du tribunal de grande instance dans le ressort duquel se trouve le domicile de ta mère. 

Ta demande sera recevable puisque selon l'article 430 du Code civil la demande peut émaner d' ""*un parent ou un allié, une personne entretenant avec le majeur des liens étroits et stables*"". Donc en tant que son fils c'est bon.

Tu n'es pas obligé d'avoir un avocat pour ça (article 432 du Code civil).

Ta requête devant le tribunal doit être écrite et adressée au secrétariat-greffe. Tu dois y mentionner : 

 -&gt; l'état civil de ta mère 

-&gt; les raisons de ta demande 

-&gt; tes coordonnées 

-&gt; voire le patrimoine de ta mère à protéger 


Et surtout, attention : **tu dois envoyer avec ta requête un certificat médical établi par un médecin spécial qui n'est pas votre médecin traitant** en vertu de l'article 431 du Code civil. C'est INDISPENSABLE. C'est un médecin spécialiste inscrit sur une liste du Procureur de la République. Ca coûte un peu cher par contre. Tu peux demander à ton médecin traitant comment solliciter ce médecin spécial, il doit pouvoir le contacter par le biais de l'Ordre des médecins je suppose ... 


**On arrive au noeud du problème : ta maman envoie paître le médecin spécialiste**. Comme tu t'en doutes, la jurisprudence a déjà eu affaire à ce genre de cas ... 

Un arrêt assez ancien rendu le 10 juillet 1984 par la Cour de cassation a établi que 

&gt; S'il résulte des articles 490 et 493-1 du code civil que l'altération des facultés mentales ou corporelles d'un malade doit être médicalement établie et constatée par un médecin spécialiste, préalablement à l'ouverture d'une tutelle ou d'une curatelle, **la personne qui fait l'objet de cette mesure n'est pas fondée à se prévaloir de l'absence de constatation médicale de l'altération de ses facultés, lorsque, par son propre fait, elle a rendu cette constatation impossible en se refusant à tout examen médical**. Il appartient alors au juge des tutelles de relever les éléments rendant nécessaire le placement de la personne en question sous un régime de protection des incapables. 


Après un arrêt récent rendu par la Cour d'appel de Douai (11 janvier 2013) :

&gt; si le législateur a subordonné la recevabilité de la requête saisissant le juge des tutelles à la production d'un certificat médical émanant d'un médecin inscrit sur une liste établie par le parquet, c'est uniquement pour éviter des demandes de mesure de protection abusives, et non pas pour réserver les mesures de protection aux seules personnes qui acceptent d'être examinées par un tel médecin. En effet, **certaines personnes peuvent avoir un besoin impérieux de protection, tout en refusant de le reconnaître et d'accepter leur mise sous protection juridique, et en refusant de se rendre chez le médecin et/ ou de rencontrer le juge. Il serait fondamentalement contraire à l'esprit de la loi, qui est d'assurer une protection juridique à toute personne en ayant besoin, d'exclure ces personnes de toute possibilité de protection du seul fait de leur refus, qui peut d'ailleurs résulter justement de l'altération de leurs facultés mentales rendant nécessaire leur protection**.



**Attention cependant tu auras besoin d'un certificat médical de carence rédigé par le spécialiste**. A ne surtout pas négliger. Il ne suffira pas de produire une lettre du médecin spécialiste attestant du refus de ta maman de se faire examiner pour que votre requête devienne valable. le spécialiste doit rédiger un certificat qui précise pourquoi il n'a pas pu rencontrer ta mère et donc possiblement son refus. Le spécialiste va ensuite vérifier l'existence de troubles par tous les moyens dispos et tu vas certainement l'orienter : la requête doit donc être accompagnée de tous les docs possibles qui démontrent de manière objective les problèmes de ta maman. 
 =  rapports médicaux établis lors d'hospitalisation si violences grave (ex : ta soeur ?) 
 = témoignages de voisins et de collègues, du facteur, que sais-je ... 
 = le médecin traitant peut aussi donner faire un rapport médical qui sera pris en compte 

Avec le spécialiste tu vas en fait démontrer de manière objective que la protection demandée ne servira pas d'autre intérêt que celui de protéger ta mère de sa maladie. Voilà une page qui [renseigne le contenu du certificat](http://www.tutelleauquotidien.fr/Ouverture-et-levee-fin-de-la-mesure/tutelle-curatelle-produire-le-certificat-medical.html).

Indeed, he did not promise what the far-left wanted, and I never implied that much. He did run a left-wing campaign tho, until proven otherwise: 75% taxe on high-level incomes (as dumb as that was), ""mon ennemi c'est la finance"", fierce opposition to Sarkozy and everything Sarkozy did, support to the workers of Florange etc.

As it was said earlier, his track record spoke for himself. If anyone was convinced he would act as a socialist (not even as a ""super-socialist"" as you put it), they were sadly mistaken. But Hollande did everything he could to look ""more"" like a socialist, precisely.

Anyway, today it is not just the far-left that is unhappy with his politics like you seem to imply, it is also his own electoral base, his party, and its representatives (so, the left-wing in general). The socialist majority in the Parliament is hanging by a thread, with more and more socialist MPs openly disagreeing with his politics. The greens, who were once allies, gave up on him. The members of the socialist party are quitting massively.

Most importantly, they've never actually lived in Russia.

The Putin loyalists exist among the middle-aged ethnic Russian population, though. The people who remember life in the Soviet Union, which was de-facto life in Russia, and who are at least somewhat nostalgic for it because everyone had a job, because of a perception that it was safer or that the state cared about people, and so on. In this category you have people who would happily give up democracy for a guaranteed job, and they like Putin because he essentially offered Russians a growing economy in exchange for non-interference in politics.

Overall, I think this is why Latvia is going to be just fine.

Houlà, 2-3 articles/an, ça me semble déjà énorme en physique. Rien que de monter la manip, écrire/vérifier la théorie (biblio), vérifier les résultats, écrire le papier, échanger avec les rapporteurs, et entre deux, enseigner avec des services horaires surdimensionnés : je ne comprends même pas comment on peut en faire plus de 2 par an. À moins de multiplier les thématiques, et donc de multiplier les chercheurs (difficile en temps de pénurie). Ou de casser les papiers...
Et encore, un critère de citation peut aussi être utilisé : tu peux faire 10 papiers s'ils ne sont pas cités, ils comptent moins.

C'est vrai que la façon dont il est tourné n'est pas très juste. Pourtant, ça ne semble pas très compliqué de comprendre que  si 1) on ne révolutionne pas la science N fois par quadriennal,  2) la hausse bibliométrique est une connerie. 

&gt;Il vaut mieux tout donner aux entreprises, elles ont certainement des ""avancées concrètes et matérielles"" à apporter !

C'est la stratégie du gouvernement. Entre CIR et subventions à l'embauche de docteurs, on voit bien où ils veulent en venir. Les entreprises baissent en fait leur coût du travail sur les ""ingénieurs"",  le gouvernement privatise la ""recherche"". 
Le truc marrant, c'est qu'on fournit de plus en plus de prestations payantes aux entreprises : le gouvernement leur donne de l'argent, et baisse leurs coûts, les universitaires en récupèrent une partie en bossant pour les entreprises. Le pilotage des projets revient donc au privé.

The truth is that while southern European economies could definitely be doing a better job of being disciplined and efficient, that's not going to solve the problem. Quite the contrary.

The solution comes in two parts: 

1. We have to pump a whole shitload of money into these economies, to get them going again, to get people back in jobs, to get investment happening again. *Even if* this entails a certain amount of waste.

2. Once the economy has been revived, and you can see that it's stable again, *then* you need to start working on improving the discipline and efficiency. As the economy becomes more stable, you can start gently withdrawing the stimulus and increasing the austerity-like discipline, *but* you must not do this to much or too soon, or you'll again destabilise the economy and kill the patient.

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; So, I ask you: If austerity is not the answer, what is?

In the case of countries like Italy, Spain and Portugal? 

Writing off debts and go bankrupt. But that's a very bad idea for a country that's mostly reliant on foreign goods, as any currency proceeding is not going to be very wanted on the international market. So you'll need dollars and Euro's to import your stuff, and getting these currencies might be (very) difficult. 

We can say a handful of arguments against austerity, like JayKayAu did, and it all sounds well and logical, though if the government like Portugal or Spain has no room to keep borrowing money (considering their huge (relative) state debt) and doesn't have sufficient economic growth to compensate the relative burden of the deficit, only austerity or bankruptcy remains. Of which the former is a much better solution than bringing down the entire system. 

&gt; because it has been almost 7 years since the crisis started and we still are in a bad situation.

Before the crisis, a lot of economic activity on the iberian peninsula was based on foreign investment mostly from north-Western Europe. 

I think a proportion of the solution to the current situation in Portugal and Spain lies in the North starting public investments again, and hoping the private markets follow them. If people/companies start investing again in Portugal, there will be work, there will be money, consumerism etc. 

But right now the North (especially Germany) seems fixed on decreasing their debt first, and investing later. A policy for which a word or two can be said, both for as against, as it is draining the south at this moment. 

But Germany does seem to make a sway, and 2015 proofs to be an interesting year, Germany is throwing their wages upwards taking the stranglehold from it's neighbours (Netherlands among others, with much higher wages in the low paid jobs) and if the North starts catching steam the South will surely profit from that.",0,1417359816,null,0,1417360099,0,cmgysog,t3_2nufia,t1_cmgysog,t3_2nufia,null,1425756260,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Quello che ti suggerisco e' inventarti un progetto, e cercare di portarlo avanti con Linux. 
Per esempio, ti interessa il networking. A livello di applicazioni o a livello di infrastruttura? Se ti interessano le applicazioni, installa qualunque versione derivata da Debian (anche ubuntu, perche' no), installati un server web e un framework web a scelta, a seconda dei tuoi interessi: rails e' un po' passato, django e' piu' attuale.

Poi, scaricati gli strumenti di sviluppo che preferisci (git, eclipse, ecc..), un database (postgres e' eccellente) e inizia a spippolare.

Se invece ti interessano le reti come infrastruttura, disabilita networkmanager e impara a configurare la rete a mano: dhcpcd, iptables, DNS, ntp e compagnia. Se ti interessano le reti in generale, puoi imparare a configurare vecchi router Cisco con l'emulatore GNS3 (a me non piace, ma c'e' chi lo usa); puoi anche giocherellare coi protocolli di routing con Quagga &amp; co.

Se invece sei un matematico, puoi usare Linux come potentissimo schiaccianoci per ogni tipo di problema numerico (se non ti puoi permettere Mathematica); puoi imparare a usare e configurare TeX, sistema contrito ma potentissimo, e nel mentre imparare l'amministrazione di Linux.

Per finire, se ti interessa programmare, puoi dare un'occhiata a come si scrive un driver per il kernel di linux, e magari avventurarti un po' con qualche piattaforma embedded da basso costo (raspberry o - meglio - beaglebone e compagnia)..

false,SimonGray,DENK,Nørrebro,"[It's a classic problem in macroeconomics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cycle#Mitigating_an_economic_downturn). Until the 2008 crisis, Keynesianism was (at least rhetorically) seen as old-fashioned in most of the world after decades of neoliberal conditioning, teaching us to avoid government interference in the economy at any cost.

The 2008 crisis changed this in a matter of months, however, even with the return of Keynesian countercyclical spending around the world, the response has primarily been in the form of subsidies to financial institutions and too-big-to-fail enterprises (these subsidies are not actually called a [market failure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure), but I think it should be classified as such - it is basically rent seeking). The classical Keynesian response (think [New Deal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal)) is still nowhere to be seen, so what we're all left with are overburdened welfare systems in low-growth economies that have taken on debt to support the financial sector since 2008. And of course most countries now have _exceptionally_ well-off financial sectors since they have recovered much more quickly than the other sectors due to targeted investments from the government.

When people talk about austerity they are complaining that the countercyclical response only came in the form of subsidies to the sector of the economy that caused the crisis and it was paid for by cuts to the welfare systems around Europe (and by taking on more debt). The alternative would have been to regulate the financial sector more heavily rather than giving it cheap loans and then subsidising the people directly instead (by not making cuts to social programs in the face of increased demand caused by the crisis), but no one had the guts to do that anywhere. 

It might have been a bad solution to let banks fail and let the government buy all the remains for cheap, but we will never know since no one ever dared to do it. Instead, we rewarded the shareholders and administrators of these companies in the name of economic stability. Personally, I think we need some politicians that actually dare to fight for the people rather than always being intimidated by moneyed interests.

false,JayKayAu,AUST,Australia,"&gt; Isn't one of the big criticisms of Keynesianism that governments have basically never followed this principle? Why would they start now?

Well, Keynesian stimulus was used in Australia in response to the Global Financial Crisis in early 2009. It was a textbook-perfect execution of the stimulus. There were three parts: 

1. A cash handout ($900 per taxpayer, directly into our bank accounts) for immediate stimulus, 
2. Funding of a lot of ""shovel-ready"" light/medium infrastructure projects, 
3. Funding of long-term large infrastructure projects.

Our economy basically rode straight over the bump, we avoided recession, and it kept going stronger and stronger to this day. 

Did I mention that this worked perfectly? 

The problem, generally, with Keynesian stimulus is indeed that it's rarely *actually done*. The US did a half-stimulus job at the same time, and while it didn't work as clearly and obviously it did in Australia, it did at least staunch the loss to a great extent, and it looks like the US is more-or-less going again (with incredible levels of inequality, but that's a separate question).

false,Nyxisto,GERM,Germany,"&gt; That is Part 1 of the solution, yes. 

This is not a solution. All let's say, the US  for example, has done is blowing up their GDP *nominally*. Every dollar the central bank pumps into the economy is one dollar in growth *by definition*.

 Raising your college costs and increasing student debt is GDP growth. Setting a forest on fire and rebuilding it is Keynesian stimulus. It's a purely fictional number that doesn't say anything. 

Median household income corrected by purchasing power hasn't really risen significantly since the 80's in the Western World. Our so called GDP growth is nothing but the money press and enrichment of the top few percent. I'd rather be an unemployed person in Spain with health coverage and free education than somebody working two jobs to survive in the US.

It's not the German approach that's dogmatic, it's the economic view on nominal variables that have very little to do with what's actually going on in reality.

What the European countries are suffering from is the inability to turn the existing  capital into innovation and progress which in return results in profits for the investors. Real growth comes from real economic progress, not from the ECB. You can temporarily circumvent this by having the ECB pumping fantasy money into the economy to create useless jobs, but it's only delaying the problem.

There is a theory that claims that at the time the Illiad was created and became a part of the oral tradition, most people were not conscious in the modern sense of the world but rather had a ['bicameral mind'.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)) 

&gt;According to Jaynes, ancient people in the bicameral state of mind would have experienced the world in a manner that has some similarities to that of a schizophrenic. Rather than making conscious evaluations in novel or unexpected situations, the person would hallucinate a voice or ""god"" giving admonitory advice or commands and obey without question: one would not be at all conscious of one's own thought processes per se. Research into ""command hallucinations"" that often direct the behavior of those labeled schizophrenic, as well as other voice hearers, supports Jaynes's predictions.[1]

&gt;Jaynes built a case for this hypothesis that human brains existed in a bicameral state until as recently as 3000 years ago by citing evidence from many diverse sources including historical literature. He took an interdisciplinary approach, drawing data from many different fields.[2] Jaynes asserted that, until roughly the times written about in Homer's Iliad, humans did not generally have the self-awareness characteristic of consciousness as most people experience it today. Rather, the bicameral individual was guided by mental commands believed to be issued by external ""gods"" — commands which were recorded in ancient myths, legends and historical accounts. This is exemplified not only in the commands given to characters in ancient epics but also the very muses of Greek mythology which ""sang"" the poems: the ancients literally heard muses as the direct source of their music and poetry.",0,1417365679,null,0,false,0,cmh0vn2,t3_2ntu9e,t1_cmh0vn2,t1_cmgy1uz,null,1425755235,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt;**Germans find ancestry unimportant for being-German**

&gt;*What makes a Germans to Germans? German ancestors did not need it for, say, a clear majority of the population. For them, the language is crucial.*

&gt;Being-German is no longer a question of descent for most Germans. The definition of national identity has changed fundamentally in Germany, as is apparent from a study of the Berlin Institute for Empirical Research integration and migration from the previously cited Der Spiegel [magazine].

&gt;As a criterion for being-German comes first language: 96.8 percent of respondents expressed the opinion was German, who could speak German. The second most frequently mentioned condition (78.9 percent) was the presence of a German passport. Only 37 percent said a German must also have German ancestors.

&gt;At the same time the investigation also brought resentment to light, especially against Muslims. As indicated 37.8 percent, that could not be German, who wear a headscarf.

Reforming or abolishing the Euro until more of a political and cultural union between the countries can be achieved. Returning to floating-rate currencies to allow external devaluation with minimal pain or suffering at home.

An increased role of the nonprofit and charity sector (including religious institutions) in the provision of social services. This has been attempted with mixed results in the UK and Denmark, among others.

Abolition of the EU, which has proven very prone to lobbying and cronyism, and replacing it with a system that will defend social democracy.

Seeking greater economic and political independence from the US and a number of global markets (healthcare, for instance) that are built around the US system and not the social-democratic system.

Isolationism/withdrawing from global markets that have no respect for European values.

The alternative would have been to regulate the financial sector more heavily rather than giving it cheap loans and then subsidising the people directly instead (by not making cuts to social programs in the face of increased demand caused by the crisis), but no one had the guts to do that anywhere. 

Is anyone proposing the status quo of just maintaining the welfare state as-is? I take it that is viewed as a pretty radical proposition of the likes of Die Linke and Enhedslisten. In contrast, the US (as far-right as it is) actually has one party that is focusing on expanding benefits (see Obamacare, which unfortunately and perhaps not coincidentally came at the same time as the collapse of the Greek and Cypriot universal healthcare systems and the starvation by cuts of most others) and another party that is mainly focused on reversing them. The political spectrum in some ways is reversed from the US in that the centrist (Democrat) party is the party of change and the right (Repub) party is that of continuity while in Europe all but the hard left is supporting substantial changes to the welfare state.",0,1417367551,null,0,false,0,cmh1o4b,t3_2nufia,t1_cmh1o4b,t1_cmgz6yk,null,1425754865,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

In regard to the economic situation, which is not caused by austerity, or budget deficits, it's purely a structural issues with the euro.

Afterwards the ECB needs to start a programme of Quantitative Easing and pumping capital in the economies that need it the most, such as Spain and Greece.

Now that Austerity is officially over or soon over in Greece with the Troika/Greece currently in negotiations to complete the process right now, the next few years will have a huge economic stimulus program to bring down un-employment to around 15-18% by 2020. And to 10% by 2030.

Prossimo step, usa un dyndns per registrare dinamicamente IP su un dominio, e fai in modo che il tuo ""sito"" sia accessibile dall'esterno.

Fai tutto senza fare mai copia/incolla di comandi, e cercando di capire come le varie componenti interagiscono tra di loro. Lo step successivo e' familiarizzare con bash: la shell e' uno strumento estremamente potente, e ti permette di risolvere problemi anche complessi con pochi comandi opportunamente concatenati.

What you don't understand is how much these countries value the prospect of EU membership. How much they actually want to leave Russia and the past behind, so much that Ukrainians would rather fight the Russians for it. 

The political situation in Eastern Europe is not complicated at all. These are former communist countries that never truly saw independence with the exception of the last 25 years. Now Russia sees their independence as a mistake and wants them back, they understand this and they don't like it, that's why they reach to the EU for economic and political help. This also applies to former communist countries already in the EU. We know what Russia is capable of and we knew of their intentions all along, for all these countries joining the EU and NATO was a tremendous boost to national security. 

The EU will not make them members on the spot, no, but it will guide their political reforms, they will help them financially and in time will create real partners and eventually members.

---

&gt;__Betteridge's law of headlines__ is an [adage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adage) that states: ""Any [headline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headline) which ends in a [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark) can be answered by the word *no*."" It is named after Ian Betteridge, a British technology journalist,  although the general concept is much older.  The observation has also been called ""__Davis' law__""   or just the ""__journalistic principle__"".  In the field of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics), the concept, referring to the titles of research papers, has been referred to as __Hinchliffe's Rule__  since before 1988.

At best it's the EU being politically stupid, at worst we've actively thrown Ukraine into a civil war of our own doing and, despite it being our fault, are doing *nothing* to help.

If Ukraine wants to join the EU (which isn't something I support), and the EU is willing to have them, the EU should be protecting Ukraine from their neighbours on the other side who want to stop Ukraine from proceeding.

I understand perfectly, I don't think you understand me. My opinion on Ukraine in the EU aside, the EU has failed spectacularly at foreign policy here and brought huge suffering onto Ukrainians by inviting them to start the application process and then sitting on the sidelines as an increasingly one-sided war breaks out entirely because we gave Ukraine that hope.

• Some people masturbate and some do not
• Masturbation is not harmful, but should be done in private

• Many boys and girls begin to masturbate during puberty
• Masturbation does not cause physical or emotional harm

false,Alteryo,FRNK,Franken,"Ich liebe es, in diesen Threads zu posten. Das gibt mir immer die Möglichkeit, nochmal meine Woche Revue passieren zu lassen und ersetzt in gewisser Weise so ein Tagebuch.

**Monday**  
Die Woche fing damit an, dass erstmal meine Morgenveranstaltungen ausgefallen sind. Daher bin ich, nachdem ich erstmal ausgeschlafen hatte, trainieren gegangen: Trizeps und Brust. Ich merke auch schon langsam, wie ich Fortschritt mache, vor allem in Sachen Stärke.  
Von 17 Uhr bis 23 Uhr war ich dann doch noch an der Uni und am Ende des Tages dementsprechend auch fertig, vor allem, weil das Ganze die 6 Stunden durch ging.

**Dienstag**  
Nach dem Aufstehen bin ich erstmal in die Stadt marschiert und hab biometrische Bilder für meinen neuen Reisepass machen lassen. Da mein alter Pass nächstes Jahr im Mai ausläuft, hab ich den sicherheitshalber jetzt schonmal beantragen lassen: Fliege ja im April nächsten Jahres für 2-3 Wochen in die USA.  
Von 18 - 21.30 Uhr hätte ich zwar Uni gehabt, bin aber nicht hin weil kein Bock... Im Nachhinein vielleicht keine so gute Idee, weil ich die nächsten zwei Wochen kaum Zeit habe, das, was ich verpasst habe, zu nachzuholen.

**Miércoles**  
Mittwoch war erstmal ganz normal Uni. Am Abend dann auf ne Party, wobei ich mich dieses Mal mit dem übermäßigen Alkoholkonsum in Grenzen gehalten hab... nachdem ich am Samstag davor nen kompletten Absturz hatte. Die Party war ganz cool eigentlich. Beer Pong gespielt: Zwar am Anfang keinen einzigen Ball versenkt, aber dann im Stand-Off dann den entscheidenden gemacht (mit Ansage sogar!). Im Laufe der Party hab ich dann noch ein Mädchen kennen gelernt, hat aber nicht so richtig zwischen uns gefunkt, daher werde ich das auch nicht weiter verfolgen. Aber so ein bisschen Flirten tut auch mal wieder gut. Letzten Endes war ich auch nicht arg lang auf der Party und bin um halb 1 Uhr dann auch wieder gegangen.

**Þunresdæg**  
Am Donnerstag hab ich dann nur eine Veranstaltung gehabt, von 10 Uhr is 12 Uhr. Danach dann wieder trainieren gegangen: Beine und Rücken. Nach dem Training bin ich dann direkt nach Hause in meine Heimatstadt gefahren und war endlich mal wieder zu Hause in meinem guten alten Kinderzimmerbett &lt;3

**Biyernes**  
Früh bin ich als allererstes gleich mal ins Bürger Büro gegangen und hab endlich mal meinen Pass beantragen lassen. Danach hatte ich nen Termin in der Redaktion meiner Lokalzeitung und wurde dort wegen nem Projekt an der Uni interviewt. Das Ganze lief eigentlich ganz gut, bis auf die Frage: ""Du bist aber schon deutsch, oder?"" Die Frage war komplett unnötig und hätte mich fast aus der Fassung gebracht. Das hat nur wieder meine Vorurteile gegenüber dieser Zeitung bestätigt.  
Nach dem Interview hab ich mich dann gegen Grippe impfen lassen, bin Einkaufen gegangen und hab dann zu Hause erstmal richtig fett [Pancit](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancit) gekocht. Dadurch dass ich ja geimpft worden bin, war ich am Nachmittag aber so fertig, dass ich erstmal von 15 Uhr bis 20 Uhr geschlafen hatte. Dementsprechend war ich am späten Abend natürlich wieder fit und konnte bis 3 Uhr nachts nicht schlafen.  
Hab dafür aber das neue Haftbefehl Album gehört, was absolut pervers geil ist. Lange nicht mehr so ein Deutschrap Album gefeiert. [*Ich Rolle Mit Meim Besten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8ETnXrsaoM) ist Song des Jahres... der Beat ist [insert fire emoticons here], Chaftis Flow sitzt und Marten ist wie geschaffen für den Beat. Das Album als Ganzes ist auch krass und erinnert ein wenig and *Good Kid, M.a.a.d. City*, zumindest wenn man die reflektierenden Songs, wie die drei *1999* Parts, den Banger Tracks, wie *Ich Rolle Mit Meim Besten*, gegenüberstellt.

**Dies Saturni**  
Den Samstag hab ich eigentlich nur damit verbracht, mich auf die kommende Woche vorzubereiten. Deshalb ist da auch nicht sonderlich viel passiert, bin auch sogar vor Mitternacht ins Bett gegangen.

**Søndag**  
Nach so nem komischen Traum bin ich um 5 Uhr früh aufgewacht, war trotzdem aber relativ fit. Hab dann schonmal den Text hier geschrieben und dann weiter meine Uni-sachen vorbereitet. Daher kam mir das mit dem Frühaufstehen auch ganz gelegen. Jetzt muss ich nur noch wieder meine Sachen packen, ein bisschen lernen und gehe dann auch wieder früh ins Bett.

false,Reilly616,EURO,European Union,"Not really, but I think that needs to be explained to the EU's citizens more effectively. 

Let's just take one of the larger countries as a comparative example; the UK.

Many people complain that the European Parliament is the EU's only directly elected institution. However, the UK only has one directly elected national institution too; the House of Commons. Each institution is the Lower House of the Legislature. So, let's go through the comparative institutions:

* Lower House: Commons/EP - Both directly elected (but the EP is elected by proportional representation, and thus more democratic).

* Upper House: Lords/Council of the EU - The Lords are merely selected by the UK's Government. Their legitimacy is two steps removed (like judges), coming from the executive, which gets its legitimacy from the Lower House. The Council of the EU, on the other hand, is composed of Government Ministers, who get their legitimacy directly from their respective national Parliaments. Most of these members have also been directly elected at national level *to* their national Parliaments.

* Head of Government: Prime Minister/President of the Commission - In the UK the Prime Minister and Government are elected by the Lower House. In the EU, the Commission and its President are elected by the Lower House. In some EU Member States, the UK included, the PM must come from the directly elected Lower House. This is not the case at EU-level.

* Head of State: Queen/European Council (including its President) - In the UK, the Head of State is a monarch, and thus not democratically legitimate. The position is maintained by Parliament though, so you might see it as somewhat legitimated that way. In the EU, the Head of State is (unofficially) collectively the most powerful executive officer from each Member State. They are legitimated in different ways in their Member States, either via the Parliament, or directly from the People. They elect their President to represent them.

* Judiciary: The judiciary is not a democratic institution in either the EU or the UK, nor should it be, for obvious reasons. Judges at each level can be removed from office for serious breaches.",0,1417371224,null,0,1417377633,0,cmh3eco,t3_2nutt8,t1_cmh3eco,t3_2nutt8,null,1425754058,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Hardly enough people are going to pick to do vocational courses because they have this pointless stigma against them, even though a clever plumber is much more valuable and much more impressive than a stupid accountant. Schools are failing to provide one of their basic functions, which is to create a workforce well prepared for the nation's needs. 

People aren't naturally going to sort themselves out into the exact right quantities for the country's needs, but if we're to get a properly trained and specialised workforce, then we're going to need to *at the very least* incentivise students to go down non STEM paths. 

There's a lot which is wrong with the German system. It seriously undermines student choice, in order to create a well trained work force. But the UK system undermines the achieving of an appropriately specialised workforce by the over emphasis of student choice. The best solution lies somewhere in the middle, and possibly slightly to one side.

At the very least, the German compartmentalisation of the schools into various disciplines leads to each school being run efficiently for that discipline. Sticking a head teacher in charge of wood technology, food technology, chemistry, engineering, history, Spanish, Religious Education, biology, PSHE, geography and all the rest leads to a comprehensive which lacks the specialisation to adequately teach students to the best of the country's abilities. It doesn't totally fail, but it would be improved by further compartmentalisation. 

The Germans could possibly also learn something from the way we phase in choice over time e.g. by being given bloc choices at GCSE to pick from, and then more choice at A-level but with some reference to GCSE choices and success before them.

Atheneum is mostly the same as Gymnasium but without Latin and Greek so pupils know what they are getting in to when they choose to go to a Gymnasium.

Also, Gymnasium requires the highest CITO-score (A test you make during your last year of primairy school to determine your capabilities) so most students are advised and often by themselves eager to go to a Gymnasium.

The general bias at my school is that Latin can be somewhat useful and is slightly easier, whereas Greek is useless and difficult (partly due to a different alphabet) so most students choose Latin over Greek.",0,1417371896,null,0,false,0,cmh3qxp,t3_2ntu9e,t1_cmh3qxp,t1_cmh1t7f,null,1425753896,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The Greens are far-Leftists, and the members of the Socialist Party who oppose him now are those that feel close to the Greens or to the Far-Left politician Mélanchon and never liked Hollande to begin with, they just saw a chance to win the presidency back through him. Their opinions have no credibility, their candidate, Martine Aubry, lost the primary, it's Hollande the center-Left moderate who was elected, and now that he's been elected they just turn against him because they're huge idiots who only care about themselves instead of their party.

His only really Leftists propositions, outside of gay marriage, were just stunts, and were received as such by everyone. In today's world, the president can't do much. No one who wasn't delusional believed Hollande, a moderate nobody that had been incompetent at the head of his party and was dubbed Flamby, would suddenly head the anticapitalist crusade those who hate him for not being Leftist enough want.

Hollande was elected because people were tired of Sarkozy, not for his propositions or personality, and in the end he simply sucks just as much, period.

EDIT :
&gt; It's another debate, but I'll answer in the same constructive and argument-backed fashion you seem to appreciate: nope, it is absolutely not what is needed.

By business, I meant small companies more than huge corporations, but they absolutely need to be supported, they are choking on regulations right now, and the country's image in business around the world is terrible. Also, France has to cut spending. The state represents a ridiculous 58% of national spending. Not only does France spends enormous amounts of money, but a large part of it is wasted on an outdated, super-heavy administration, with multiple useless layers, such as those on the departmental scale, instead of being focused on healthcare or education, and even when it's spent where it should, it's so mismanaged it ends up being wasted anyway. Everything is too complicated, everything is too rigid, the government absolutely needs to manage this better and try to cut it back a little, so we don't choke on our own debt, while at the same time supporting companies so jobs can be created. 

Outside of the extremes such as Mélanchon, Duflot or Le Pen, everyone agrees with that, with more or less insistence on business on the Right and social services on the Left. To expect Hollande to do the opposite is being delusional, hence why his biggest critics are, by some incredible coincidence, the far-Left and the far-Right, who never cared about reality.",0,1417372034,null,0,1417375048,0,cmh3tlp,t3_2ntpue,t1_cmh3tlp,t1_cmgxdjy,null,1425753861,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

UK debt was/is cheap because investors have confidence in it, and they have confidence in it because they believe that government has a credible plan. 

All in all it's impossible to say what could have been.

Now, I agree with you in general with your analysis of the economic situation several years ago. Our growth was extremely sluggish and the UK did need a stimulus. But given that we didn't use a stimulus and we're now on the road to recovery anyway (later than we might have been otherwise, but also with less debt than otherwise), it seems a bit late to be calling for a stimulus now.
