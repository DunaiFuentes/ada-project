Israel is a flawed democratic nation-state.

Within ""Israel proper,"" Israel is no more discriminatory than Latvia or Croatia, which is to say that there is some institutionalized discrimination in favor of the ethnic majority.

 I remember we had several private rooms, with some children's, with cancer or any other oncological disease, that was inevitable his dead, for several reason, some incurable, some because the cancer spreaded to fast and already got all the organs, or some of them, the medication just didn't work, or did any good. 

 I'm talking of children's with 3, 4, 8 years old, or some of them, just born, children's taking kimio meds, some of them for 3 4 5 years or more, knowing that some of them are just waiting dead to come. Children's with brain tumor for example, while time pass, they start loosing the vision, ability to talk, ear, or even move and make any gesture, but, they'r probably conscious, can you fucking imaging this?! So, they are put in coma, and stay like this until dead comes. Children's with this age, they have a bigger regeneration that the adults, so they handle the quimio much more time than the adults, also, the psychological part of the treatment, just work much more! They can take quimio therapy for years! Even if is just to ""try"" or retard what is well known. 
 Did anyone see what a quimio therapy do to any adult? Imagine that for years... 

I remember been there, with my mom and dad, and meet other parents, getting out of there, and say goodbye to those same parents, I remember going there for 2 years every week, and those parents are there! I remember my last medication day, and those parents are there! I remember going out of there after 5 years with a smile on my face after the doctor tell me ""your cured now!"" And leaving the hospital, and those parents are there...


I'm sorry if I was to rude, but I saw this with my how eyes, and this was 18 years ago, I still remember those people like it was yesterday...

That said... I don't know if I was able to put a end in a kid life, becouse, I have been around that, but I was never in that position of parent. But I would like to have a option to. ",0,1392334909,null,0,false,0,cfeqtz9,t3_1xtoaj,t1_cfeqtz9,t3_1xtoaj,null,1432387407,17,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,17

Allora.. secondo me i tuoi amici ti hanno mal consigliato; se si tratta di un lavoro, i soldi devono essere menzionati PRIMA che tu inizi, altrimenti ti troverai sempre in posizione di svantaggio (leggi: o accetti, o attaccati).

Io chiederei un appuntamento, e imposterei il discorso cosi': hai dimostrato (coi piccoli interventi sui PC) di saper lavorare, ora per continuare colla rete wireless sarebbe necessario un accordo sui compensi, giusto per rendere la partita equilibrata: hai dimostrato di fidarti coi 'piccoli interventi' gratis, ora sta alla controparte fare una offerta onesta.

Per quanto riguarda i prezzi: la prima cosa da mettere in chiaro e' cosa e' compreso e cosa e' escluso nel progetto; altrimenti anche se rimedi i 500 euro sarai sempre suscettibile di essere chiamato la domenica mattina perche' ""il wireless e' lento"".

Quindi patti chiari: fatti specificare se vogliono solo piazzare un po' di accesspoints a giro per l'albergo, o se hanno bisogno anche di autenticazione, accounting e gestione degli utenti - nel qual caso, i prezzi salgono. 

Lo stesso per il supporto: puoi proporre un collaudo alla consegna, dove verra' verificata la connettivita' in ogni stanza, e finita li'; oppure puoi offrire anche assistenza, ma in questo caso devi specificare una tariffa di un qualche tipo, altrimenti non te li togli piu' di dosso.

Infine, per orientarti un po', un trucco utile potrebbe essere quello di vedere quanto le ditte della tua zone/regione farebbero pagare una simile istallazione.

Tieni presente che - per un albergo - la rete wireless e' ormai indispensabile; non e' un optional: se non pagano te (che conoscono) dovranno pagare qualcun altro (che potra' essere una fregatura).

L'errore marchiano e' vergognarti di chiedere un compenso per il lavoro che hai fatto e stai facendo.

A head of Government, in my view, should be able to be kicked out when the public comes to want that enough (I'm not talking impeachment), and that is far easier in a parliamentary system. 

The two party system is disappointing. A voting system of proportional representation would help alleviate this, as FPTP only serves to exacerbate it. When a legislature is composed of only two parties (especially where the Government can be of a different colour to the legislature), there is less compromise, less agreement, less working together in general. In a parliamentary democracy, Governments usually need coalitions to be formed. Thus, political stances are compromised, watered down, become more nuanced, and generally become more representative of the varied views of the population.

I dislike any system where the Head of Government does not have to defend himself in front of elected representatives day in, day out. Prime Ministers sit in a House of Parliament and have to publicly defend their positions in debates. They get their hands dirty and they do so publicly. They aren't turned into almost untouchable celebrities as seems to be the case with US Presidents. They are primus inter pares, and they are *inter* pares.

That should be enough for more science oriented courses. You can even write your thesis and publications in English if you find the right department and prof who is willing to support you.

[This map](http://taxfoundation.org/sites/taxfoundation.org/files/UserFiles/Image/Blog/ftsbs-large.jpg) shows US states' federal spending to federal tax payments ratio. These are fairly constant year over year.

Rich states pay far more federal taxes than they receive in spending every year, poorer states get far more federal money than they pay every year. This is just business as usual in the US. The US began as a Federation after independence. This was bolstered by the Revolutionary war where the colonies fought together against Great Britain. So even if they had their differences, fighting a common enemy likely had a unifying effect.

Si notre population avait commencé à décliner dans les années 80, on aurait probablement pas construit autant de centrales d'incinération, d'épuration, de centres de recyclage, etc, et finalement on polluerait probablement autant. Donc fail. Ce qui compte c'est de réduire notre emprunte écologique, pas de réduire notre population.

Ça me semble tiré par les cheveux. Il y a deux choses. La première, c'est que dire que ""si on était moins nombreux on polluerait plus individuellement"" c'est une hypothèse qui est tienne, sur laquelle tu rajoutes que ce surplux de pollution individuelle compenserait la différence de population, ce qui est une autre hypothèse. Je ne partage aucune des deux. Deuxièmement, je ne te parle pas du présent, mais du futur. Et dans le futur, la réalisation la plus probable, c'est qu'aujourd'hui les mentalités ont changé, et que la pression pour ne pas polluer qui est bien là ne va pas s'évanouir si la population stagne ou se réduit. Et donc si on pouvait éviter d'atteindre 10 milliards d'habitants, ça serait mieux, tout simplement. 

&gt; L'exemple typique est la Chine, où malgré leur dénatalité, ils se sont mis à polluer tellement que c'est bien l'irrespirabilité de l'air et la pollution de l'eau potable qui conduisent le pays à se bouger pour limiter son intensité énergétique.

Tu dis ""malgré leur dénatalité"". Mais enfin leur dénatalité elle est arrivée beaucoup trop tard ! Ils ne se sont pas retrouvé plus d'un milliard par magie ! Ils sont nombreux parce qu'ils ont une une forte natalité par le passé, qu'ils sont extrêmement nombreux aujourd'hui et la planète en paye le prix. Et heureusement que leur natalité est faible aujourd'hui, pour le bien des futures générations. La chine est justement *le* contre exemple flagrant de tes propres arguments.

&gt; Bref dire qu'être moins nombreux fera qu'on polluera moins c'est la même chose que dire qu'augmenter les impôts va augmenter les recettes de l'Etat, ce n'est pas du tout automatique...

Et bien non ce n'est pas la même chose du tout parce que (encore une fois - mais je t'en veux pas je t'aime) tu regardes le problème localement. Si augmenter les impôts en France n'augmente pas les recettes de l'État, c'est parce que les gros contribuables se tirent à l'étranger - ce n'est pas automatique parce que tu ne regardes pas un système fermé.

That's why in normal, casual conversation between Germans (or Austrians for that matter, since I'm from Austria which has quite a similar situation) it wouldn't come up as a topic very often I think. Only when talking to ""outsiders"", like here on reddit, would it become one.

Don't get me wrong though, I still think there's a shared feeling of obligation to keep the memory alive. In school, the topic is covered extensively (we dedicated the most part of 7th and 8th grade history classes to it), and it should. Memorials should be kept, built, and things like historical research and political gestures (eg. wreath ceremonies attended by politicians) should continue. This is where we might fare a bit better than Japan, with it's Yazukuni Shrine visits and tendencies for historical revisionism.

Where it gets interesting though, and this is especially true for Austria: I have the feeling that nowadays, the willingness to keep the topic an important one in contemporary intellectual discourse is only shared among declaredly left-wing intellectuals. And the fact that many parallels could be drawn between the economical problems and the situation of immigrants, especially Muslims, today and the situation Germany/Austria faced before WW2 is gravely overlooked.

We weren't in ""full hate mode"" about him we were just taking the piss but obviously, a 14 yo teenager can suffer from that as well if he or she is unsure about his or her sexuality and it took us until 9th grade to realise that some people might not be as comfortable with that as we were and could actually be bothered by getting their sexuality questioned by stupid jokes (we saw at as jokes, he probably didn't).

I don't think we were an ordinary class in that regard. For once, we were a pretty good Realschule. Usually, we ranked somewhere between the Gymnasiums. We had people in school that pretty much flew through from the Gymnasium to the Hauptschule because my school wanted to keep the reputation up and therefore demanded more from the students than some Gymnasien. 

Also, the typical homophobes are either old or religious. We had one Christian girl (typically, most people were Christians but she was actually taking that somewhat serious) that pretty much said that it's none of her business. We also only had 1 or 2 Muslims. A girl from Turkey who didn't really believe in anything and didn't eat pork because they were not used to it and therefore just didn't like it and a dude from Morocco who didn't care much either. So compared to the Berufskolleg where I did my Fachabitur, we were a pretty moderate class.

There weren't much influences one way or the other. We just thought his behaviour was funny and then we realised why it might be funny and just stop making fun of him. I'm not sure if the outcome would have been the same if we had some homophobes in class (as much as that's possible with 16 yo. It seems like teenagers usually copy their parents) that could promote such hateful behaviour.

Now, Berufskolleg was a totally different story. We had some people there that held the opinion that gay people are like animals and should be treated as such. Those people were in their 20s. Luckily, as much as those people became common, people that held the opposite opinion became common as well and the homophobes usually got a lot of shit for it from others.

Not to drag you down again :D

I'm certain there are a lot of nice people that snap out of it after high school. But it's certainly something I'd keep an eye on and something I think the German society has to give people shit for. Luckily, they usually do in my opinion. 

Edit: In case somebody is interested, the person we made fun of in school is now running around like Marilyn Manson and has no problem with his (homo)sexuality.

In questo modo, per cercare di aver 500, perdi anche il lavoro.

Quello che invece occore fare e' negoziare: a loro interessa il wireless (che per un albergo e' fondamentale), e a te interessa essere retribuito per il tuo tempo. Occorre trovare un punto di convergenza, perche' una rottura non conviene ne' a te ne' a loro.

Per questo occorre valutare la complessita' del lavoro, e quanto verrebbe a costare se qualcun altro lo facesse; cosi' a caso non e' possibile fare una stima (perche' 500 e non 300, o 700?). Poi, fai una offerta competitiva, magari con un robusto sconto visto che sei agli inizi; a loro converra' accettare, tanto dovrebbero comunque pagare qualcun altro. Se non accettano, chiedi di rilanciare; e se l'offerta e' troppo bassa, fai presente che la concorrenza chiederebbe di piu', e guarda come butta. Negoziare e' un'arte che si impara con l'esperienza, non si puo' spiegare in due righe; ma non perdere mai di vista il fatto che da un accordo beneficierete entrambi.

Infine, ribadisco il concetto: se si tratta di accesspoint a caso, forse il costo puo' essere pure minore di 500 euro. Se hanno bisogno di sistemi piu' complessi, il tempo e i costi possono salire di un bel po'; ma in questo caso considera anche quello che potresti imparare (e che potrai rivendere in seguito) su radius, captive portal eccetera.

Obama hasn't just been touched, he's been molested by Congress.  Obama only truly got to lead from early 2009 (when the Democrats got 60 Senate votes) until late 2010.  Since then, Congress has blocked basically everything he's proposed and has shit all over his public image.  The Republican public frequently mocks and harasses him (e.g., the Birther nut jobs who insisted that he wasn't born in America).

Regarding lack of compromise: there are several features of the federal government which make it hard to pass legislation.  A bill must pass in two legislatures (House and Senate) and then avoid a presidential veto, unlike in  parliamentary system, where bills must only pass through one legislature.  A bill needs 60 out of 100 votes to pass the Senate: a simple majority isn't enough.  Even if a bill passes all those hurdles, it might be struck by the Supreme Court, or various states might find creative ways to frustrate it.

The system was designed this way because the member states feared that the federal government would infringe on their autonomy.  The EU has even stricter limits on its power for the same reason.

This system used to produce compromise, because no bill could pass so many hurdles without it.  But now, the system produces gridlock because the Republicans refuse to work with Obama.

true,executivemonkey,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;There seems to be a sort of mythologizing of the democratic process and institutions.

Yes, that is a big problem, but mainly as it affects Congress.  The Presidency is the least flawed branch of government.

The House of Representatives has a problem called gerrymandering.  Long story short, the political parties create electoral districts that almost guarantee that their Congressional candidates will win.  The politicians get to pick their voters instead of vice-versa.

[Here](http://www.buzzfeed.com/qsahmed/the-10-most-gerrymandered-districts-in-america-dh45?s=mobile) are some examples.

This means that many Congressmen only fear a challenger from their own party, which pushes them towards radicalism and away from compromise with the other party.

The Senate gives disproportionate representation to small states, because every state has two senators, regardless of its population.  Tiny Rhode Island has as much say as California.  This lets little states with less than half a million people shut down proposals made by states that represent tens of millions.

Also, a simple majority isn't enough to pass legislation through the Senate.  A Senator can simply refuse to yield the floor and thus prevent all voting.  That happens constantly.  It's called filibustering, and it takes 60 out of 100 votes to override it.

The end result is a system that (purposefully) frustrates democracy and makes it hard to pass important reforms.  Originally, this was done to weaken the federal government so that it wouldn't infringe on the autonomy of member states.  Today it is a huge problem, because the federal government has vastly increased its importance and responsibilities, yet it still has these 18th century handicaps that people respect because they come from the Constitution.

But doesnt that logic also apply to the creation of the Euro itself? It removed the ability to enact monetary policy for all Eurozone countries on an individual basis. It was inevitable a monetary policy that was good for Germany would not be good for Greece at some point without some wealth distribution mechanism to counter it. In fact, recently leaked documents show it was a concern of the German government at the Euro's formation, yet it was pushed through anyway as-is. This was not an honest mistake as some think it was, concerns were brushed aside so Germany and France could realize their dream of a Federalized Europe. If that is not putting democracy on the back burner I dont know what is, and now a significant portion of the EZ population is paying for it. Please dont read this as me blaming Germany and France, today's troubled European nations were all too happy to join the club to substantially reduce their borrowing costs, but Germany and France had the power to keep them out until they were ready.

&gt;The Market consists of companies and they should abide our laws and be quiet. They have no vote, why should they determine the course of our sovereign republics?

I realize virtually all European nations do not want to turn over this power to the EU (and I think that is completely understandable). But take a look at [this map](http://taxfoundation.org/sites/taxfoundation.org/files/UserFiles/Image/Blog/ftsbs-large.jpg). These numbers are the ratio of Federal spending each US state gets in relation to the amount of Federal taxes it pays. These numbers are relatively constant year over year. Yearly, there is a *very* substantial wealth distribution from wealthy, urban, liberal states to poor rural states. This is even more acute with lower income territories like Puerto Rico, where Federal inflows make up 20-25% of their GDP. This helps smooth over discrepancies that would otherwise exist when a monetary policy that worked in New York might not be the best monetary policy for Mississippi or Puerto Rico. There is no mechanism like this in the Eurozone to smooth over discrepancies between monetary policy and fiscal policy. 

I am not sure I agree fiscal integration is a corporatist policy, but it certainly removes a *very* substantial amount of control from European nations themselves. That said, the current system seems a bit unfair in my opinion, although by somebody's metric any federalized system is unfair. I live in Illinois, one of the states that gets the least of its Federal taxes back. 30% of every dollar in Federal taxes I pay goes to lower income states, but it means they can use the same dollars as me without needing a Federal formalized bailout, so it has benefits as well. The current Euro situation forces low income countries with stagnant economies to be stuck with monetary policy that has mostly been appropriate for high income countries with expanding economies. 

&gt;The ""fiscal union"" is a force for the status quo, because it orients itself on the needs of multinational companies, not european citizens. But social progress means increasing self-determination of each individual citizen. Thus the ""fiscal union"" prevents social progress.

I can definitely see where you're argument is coming from here. But I think the current system is also substantially hurting a very large percentage of European citizens as well.

(La fuite de certains gros contribuables n'a qu'une influence négligeable sur les recettes)

Il y a donc un seuil, un point d'inversion où les recettes fiscales sont maximales. Savoir où il se situe est évidemment toujours en débat, certains disent que pour l'impôt sur le revenu, il serait aussi bas que 40%, d'autres (comme Piketty) qu'il pourrait être aussi haut que 80%. Ce qui n'est pas en débat, c'est que les gens adaptent leurs comportements aux différentes incitations ou désincitations à travailler ou consommer. Remplacer travailler par polluer, et tu vois bien que les gens adaptent leur niveau de pollution (leur travail) à la dégradation de leur environnement (l'impôt): si la dégradation augmente, ils vont diminuer leur pollution, et vice-versa.

Par exemple, on peut penser qu'une des raisons pour lesquelles les américains polluent beaucoup plus par habitant que les européens c'est parce que leur densité de population est beaucoup moindre, et donc que la pression qu'ils exercent individuellement sur leur environnement est bien plus faible. Moyennant quoi, il y a beaucoup moins de pression pour polluer moins aux US qu'en UE, et ils polluent donc plus qu'en UE.

Pour la Chine, la politique de l'enfant unique a commencé avant leur industrialisation. Ce qui s'est passé depuis montre donc au contraire que l'effet de la dénatalité est minuscule par rapport aux comportements des agents économiques, et en premier lieu l'Etat. Aujourd'hui la pollution atteint un niveau tel que l'Etat chinois est en train de changer de comportement, et on va voir, mais je suis sûr que dans les dix prochaines années, l'impact de ces nouvelles politiques sera bien plus colossal que l'effet d'avoir eu moins d'enfants par le passé.

C'est pourquoi la population est un faux problème, une sorte de distraction, qui, comme c'est quelque chose qu'il est impossible de changer drastiquement (contrairement à des politiques énergétiques ou de tri et de recyclage), est très pratique. On dit ""si seulement la population baissait"" et on ne fait rien pour diminuer la pollution *directement* par des politiques publiques ou par des initiatives citoyennes.

Also why you get shit like with McCain and Romney, they're too left before the primaries, too right during the primaries and by the time of the general election nobody really knows where they stand because they've done flip-flopped in every direction to secure a nomination and still seem viable to independents/the silent majority. 

Kinda ironic though, a decade ago it was the other way around, with the Republicans having the strong brand and leadership, with the Democrats being in disarray. All that changed after Obama though.

- lesdits membres des classes populaires se trouvent un peu partout, mais surtout dans les banlieues pauvres et dans les campagnes.

- ceux des banlieues ne votent pas le pen car ils voient bien (car ils vivent avec eux) que les populations issues de l'immigration sont dans la même merde qu'eux.

I'm not sure if, Poland got it, ""for teh lulz"" though. Poland received the region after the second world war, and was due to the geopolitical reasons of the Soviet Union didn't want to give up West Belarus and Ukraine which they took in September of 1939. Meanwhile Germany had lost that war and it was very easy to simply give the territory to the new Communist state of Poland. This gave Poland a larger access to the Baltic sea and a higher industrial capability. 

Germany ins't weeping over this because they're simply glad to be one state. You have to remember that until the 1990's Germany still was two completely separate states. East Germany was a puppet of the USSR and couldn't simply just state, ""hey this is German, we should totally have this back"" 

Even if there was any sentiment to bring back East Prussia you have to realize that the logistics is just improbable. Think of the news stories. ""Germans force millions of Poles from their new homes."" uhm...yah that doesn't look very good. Not to mention West Germany had a hard enough time reintegrating the East Germans economically. It took them a long and hard time to get back to full scale.

true,Alexander_Von_Stahl,null,null,"Several reasons. Germany isn't big on military spending, despite being an industrial giant and having a very proud and illustrious past (for the most part) when it comes to anything having to do with war. Nowadays though, a lot of Germans are skeptical of any military spending or military action. So, it's nice having other countries have garrisons in the country. Also, I hear it boosts the local economies.

I personally disagree with using American garrisons as an excuse for skimping on our military. I grew up in the US, and I didn't have shame hammered into me like so many other Germans. I *am* extremely ashamed of the second world war, but I think my people are much too hard on themselves. Our forebears fucked up, big time, but that was because of a long list of factors that could have happened to several other superpowers. I'm extremely proud of my country today, and I know for a fact that we'd be as responsible with a strong military as other NATO nations are. Heck, given our pacifism lately, we'd be more responsible than most other western nations. But I digress

I think that Germany has a duty to Europe, a duty that entails being powerful enough to shield our neighbors should we come under threat. We are an industrial powerhouse, and the virtues that are fairly consistent in Germans make for great soldiers and generals. I'm certainly no warmongering, but I think it's unfair to our smaller and less wealthy neighbors that we don't provide a truly powerful umbrella of protection. Hell, with the UK on the brink of leaving the EU (which might put the legitimacy of NATO in jeopardy) France might be the only superpower left in Europe with a first class military (not that Spain and Italy couldn't pull their weight).

Just to clarify to everyone reading this so we don't get into a petty argument, I'm NOT saying that we should pull a Reagan and build a military beyond our means or possibly needs. I just think that we should maintain a military that is at *least* as strong as France's. We're not far off, but there's still some aspects of our military that need work. Having excellent infantry and armor is useless if you can't deploy properly or if you can't dominate the air and sea around the war zone.

&gt;A bill must pass in two legislatures (House and Senate) and then avoid a presidential veto, unlike in parliamentary system, where bills must only pass through one legislature. 

A parliamentary system is not exclusively unicameral, and not all Lower Houses can overrule their Upper Houses.

&gt;Even if a bill passes all those hurdles, it might be struck by the Supreme Court

Well that's pretty much the same everywhere.

I've never thought about it like that, to be honest. That's quite an interesting concept.

I think one of the disadvantages the US has (and the EU at the federal level certainly has the same problem) is that the Constitution is simply too difficult to amend.

When things in a country are going badly, they want more foreign money into the country.

In order to attract people from outside, they lower their exchange rate, which ""magically"" makes everything cheaper for other countries.

When things are going good, they can raise their exchange rates, which makes it cheaper for your citizens to buy stuff from other countries.

It's a very basic little knob that can be adjusted, trimmed, and finely tuned, in response to things that happens in the world outside.

When you give up on having your own currency, you also give up control of that knob.

That means that when things are going badly, you need another form of control.

One form of control could be that those countries who wants to turn the knob ""up"" simply donate money to those countries that want to turn the knob ""down"".

That would make those countries who are doing badly able to buy stuff from the countries that are doing well.

(currently, the US does that inter-states - poor states and rich states donate and receive)

However, it's kind of hard for Angela Merkel to explain why Germany should freely give several billion Euros to Greece, for example, so that doesn't happen so much.

Currently, it seems to me we're in a bit of a shit spiral because of that problem, and I can't really see any clear way out of it.

A central authority that determines how the knob should be turned would not be solution enough, because the knob would need to be turned up in some parts of Europe, and down in other parts of Europe - and we can't do that as long as there's one currency.

----

This is why some of the people who criticize the Euro, say that it's not been thought through, that it's been implemented badly, and that now that we're in it, with no apparent way out, the only solution is to further break down our economical borders, so the different countries' economies can be further integrated.

 Es ist für Laien nicht einfacher zu verstehen, wenn man den richtigen Fachbegriff (Anfangsverdacht) durch einen anderen aber in diesem Kontext falschen Fachbegriff (dringender Tatverdacht wie er für einen Haftbefehl benötigt wird , oder auch Datenschutz- statt Persönlichkeitsrecht) ersetzt.  Eigentlich werden die Juristen so auf Begriffe getrimmt, dass das zumindest im eigenen Gebiet nicht passieren sollte. Es ist wichtig zu wissen, worüber genau man sich gerade streiten will :) 

Auch inhaltlich hatte ich den Eindruck, dass sie einiges durcheinander wirft. 

Ein Anfangsverdacht liegt nach der Rechtsprechung sehr schnell vor: bestimmte Tatsachen müssen im Zusammenspiel mit der kriminalistischen Erfahrung die Begehung einer Straftat möglich (!) erscheinen lassen. 

Der Schluss von einem legalen Graubereich (gewisse Formen von Posing Bildern, oder anderes Beispiel: du bestellst 50 Leuchtröhren für die ""Tomatenzucht"" und hochleistungs Dünger bei einem Headshop) auf die Möglichkeit eines strafbaren Verhaltens (die Erfüllung des sehr sehr weit gefassten KiPO Paragraphen wegen der persönlichen Neigung -  eine entsprechende Google Suche reicht, im Beispiel: Anbau von Gras) ist grds. zulässig und anerkannt. 

Die Staatsanwaltschaft muss gerade keine sichere Kenntnis von strafbarem Verhalten haben. Sie muss nur Tatsachen kennen, die den Verdacht dafür nahelegen. Es reichen auch Indizien. 

Die Frage ist hier, ob eine Durchsuchung verhältnismäßig war. Im Kern also: gab es also ein milderes (genauso  geeignetes) Mittel, diesen Verdacht zu erhärten oder auszuräumen. Dazu müsste man die Akten kennen. Man weiß ja gar nicht, wie die StA sonst noch ermittelt hat. 

Sollten die Behörden wirklich Journalisten informiert haben, ist das natürlich sehr problematisch. Es ist aber eigentlich eine zweite, von dem obigen losgelöste Frage. 

Es klingt eher so, als würde sie eine extreme Mindermeinung vertreten. Das sollte man in einem Radio Interview dann aber zumindest auch sagen.

The President would rather avoid having to use his full powers as a President and issue executive orders to make the privatisations possible, but it's possible, if it comes to that. He said he will uphold the memorandum to its full extend. 

This is what the minor coalition party objects too (while the opposition disagrees with privatisations as a whole: the SocDems want only partial privatisation, and Labour wants no privatisation at all).

So, I expect that the President will modify the law proposal to please the minor coalition partner, even if that means they will always need a thin majority in the Parliament to pass each privatisation individually.

Difficile dirlo, sicuramente il periodo in cui gareggiava Pantani è stato il più discusso degli ultimi 25 anni, a causa dell'uso sistematico da parte degli atleti della famigerata [eritropoietina](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritropoietina).

Even if the Poles and Russians were willing to give it up, which they aren't, then we'd still need that territory like a hole in the head.

That's fine, in my opinon, and it is somewhat fair. 

But after the [17th Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), senators are now voted popularly and this is undemocratic and just plain schizophrenic.  Instead of a Congress with representatives of the state governments and people coming together to decide federal law, we have basically two bodies elected by the people, with radically different proportion in representation, and on completely different election cycles.  Even if you disagree with the assessment that it is undemocratic, you have to at least agree that it is a formula to a dysfuntional legislature.  Not saying if we did things differently there would be sudden harmony, but it is very odd and I think there is a better way.  

Edit: Forgot to mention that before the 17th, senators were elected by state legislatures.  People felt that senators were bought and sold, bribing state legislators to be elected to this position.  And it should be noted that the USA was more ""confederationalistic"" (I don't know if that's a real word) at the time of its conception, meaning the states had far more autonomy.  But not it's evolved into an institution that we can all agree is more like dictionary definition of a federation, which is a *single* state with many self- governing entities within and a central government holding the thing together.  Ever since the 30s and the New Deal, this has made the federal government more important in the everyday lives of Americans.  

It should also be noted that several other federations don't have an upper house that is the ""states' voice"". Take the Canadian Senate which is like the British House of Lords.  Or does represent the states but don't have nearly as much power as the lower house, like the German Federal Council, while it does help shape German federal law, it doesn't have equal power like the US Senate does to the House.

Anche se, alla fine, sappiamo tutti che si trattava di EPO, per dover di cronaca c'e' da dire che Pantani **non fu mai** accusato di doping. Fu solo sospeso alla fine di un Giro d'Italia già vinto per via dell'eccessiva densità del suo sangue. Nessun tracciante trovato nel sangue, quindi ufficialmente non si puo' parlare di doping.

Venendo al perchè di tanto amore è fin troppo facile risponderti: Pantani era uno che pedalava per la gente. Uno che in cima allo Stelvio ancora si alza in piedi sui pedali e va via, quando magari e' gia' davanti tutto solo, solo perche' i tifosi intorno glielo chiedono. 

Uno che ha sempre dato tutto e che, purtroppo, alla fine ha svolto le funzioni dell'agnello sacrificale, perche' qualcuno volle cosi'. Non dico che fosse pulito ma, senza dubbio, era meno sporco di molti altri (ad esempio Gotti, che quell'anno vinse il Giro in seguito alla sospensione del Pirata, era sporco pure peggio di Pantani...) che sono venuti dopo.

Guardati le riprese delle grandi scalate di Pantani. Guarda quello che faceva e come lo faceva per i tifosi. Poi paragonalo, per dirti un nome, ad Armstrong (il piu' merda di tutti - e chi segue il ciclismo lo ha SEMPRE SAPUTO e sostenuto) e capirai perche' ogni appassionato di ciclismo ama Pantani e schifa la gente come l'americano.

true,dirkt,null,null,"I don't follow your counterargument. Germany lost against the US and allies in WW2, so the victors could dictate conditions. One condition was that they were able to station troops in Germany as Besatzungsmacht. In the very beginning to make sure that the Germans behave and don't cause trouble, but after that because it was strategically important against the Soviets and Eastern Europe in the Cold War, and now because it's logistically important for other US military operations, like in the Near East. For the same reason, the US has stationed troops all over the world, e.g. in Japan (which incidentally also lost WW2 against the US). But WW2 provided a nice opportunity to force it on the Germans.

The Germans don't mind; as someone else has said, they pay taxes and need local services, so that's good for the economy.

So for Germany to have garrisons in the US, (1) Germany should have won a war at some time in the past against the US, to be able to dictate conditions as the victor, (2) Germany should have an interest to influence the rest of the world by military means, (3) and Germany should have enough military to be able to do this in the first place. But none of these conditions is true.

Let me play devils advocate for a minute. 
First of all, I would say that it is because the referendum is a cultural vote. Scottish people, much like in the way the Swiss voted for fewer ties with the EU last week, voted with their heart. 

That's how all referenda work, a layperson doesn't know and shouldn't need to know the intricacies of geopolitics and economics. There's a state to sort that out, after all. 

Now remember it's both in the interest of the UK and EU to keep Scotland as part of the UK. The current situation is rather stable and any changes might cause disruption that's difficult and costly to deal with. 

So I think, while it's reasonable that the EU and UK might have certain demands if the Scots vote for independence. I do have a feeling those demands are there to make those who will vote with their heart think twice. Which I don't necessarily think is a bad thing, but it's hard to give an equal argument for the other side when that side is full of even more uncertainties. 

Tl;dr: While it's not bullying. The EU and UK governments do purposely instil doubt in those voting for independence (for cultural and personal reasons) by making them aware of the fact they don't and cannot fully understand the potential economic and political consequences.

Incorrect on both counts. The studies were conducted by an independent and impartial economic organization using accepted models and scientific methodology. They absolutely are grounded in scientific and hard data. The methodology has been scrutinized by leading global economists which approved the findings. 

Second, we absolutely are accountable for the numbers we publish. This has always held true. For example, a contracting firm responsible for constructing some of the satellites published a budget and a time-frame for completion. They failed to respect this timeline, and they have been fined a large sum accordingly. We aren't pulling out numbers at random here; if we don't fulfill our obligations, I can guarantee you that there will be severe consequences for the officials responsible for Galileo. 

&gt;I've quoted 70 million Euros of predicted direct income

Sorry, this was a typo on my part. But my point still stands: these fees to acess the commercial service represent only a tiny fraction of the overall expected gains.

&gt;Is it at least imaginable that space probes and/or scientific applications, which are truly cutting edge and reach into new spheres, literally, are able to deliver the same prestige gain? 

I never disputed this fact, and we are also launching high-visibility and high-prestige scientific space exploration projects. I even listed them for you: Gaia, which will map the known universe, Rosetta, which will land on an asteroid and collect data from its surface, and many more. These are excellent projects which will contribute to humanity's understanding of space and the universe. However, Galileo will directly contribute to facilitating our lives here on Earth in the immediate future, and will have enormous positive economic impacts. **We're not doing one or the other; we're doing both.**

&gt;stop tricking ordinary citizens into believing that the system automatically generates huge income or just an increased quality of service for their everyday nav applications. Both things are not the case.

With all due respect, you are incorrect and both of these things are absolutely the case. Galileo will contribute to expanding the European economy and will have direct positive benefits to citizens' everyday lives. Galileo will work in conjunction with GPS: **the two systems are not competing against each other; rather, they will serve to augment each other and increase performance for the benefit of people around the world.**

&gt;Still, to attach any assumed growth to the availability of a European system and bluntly promoting this estimation as a ""4 billion profit"" or ""a very attractive return on investment"" doesn't arise form knowledge but bias.

Incorrect again. Experts have extensively studied the benefits of having a more precise, more performant satellite system which offers guaranteed continuity of service which no other system offers and which will open up vast new applications in new industries, and have concluded that the benefits are immense. Galileo will completely outperform current GPS capabilities. Only the next-generation GPS, which won't be fully deployed until about 2025-2030, will compare with Galileo performance.",0,1392367823,null,0,false,0,cff2sko,t3_1xjvg6,t1_cff2sko,t1_cfegcr0,null,1432393161,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,liaisons_dangereuses,ITAL,Italy,"Letta's government had many problems: a troubled start, it's always been very precarious, many of its ministers were hit by *minor* scandals (two resigned), the right-wing component was over-represented after Berlusconi withdrew his support to the coalition, and as a result he was unable to cope with Italy's problems. 

In the past 2 months, Renzi became the leader of the democratic party and started a very ambitious reform project (new election law and a rewriting of the constitution that will abolish the elective senate and reform the regions' powers). It's a difficult process that needs long times and the support of all the main parties (including the always untrustable Berlusconi).  

Up until now Renzi's game was easy to understand, he supported Letta but criticized his lack of results, and at the same time tried to score some points on his own by reforming the political system in a way that would avoid the current *impasse*, so he could then go to new elections and be able to form a proper government. 

In the past weeks, Letta lost the support of the industry federation, now is under attack from every side and probably unable to survive for another year (needed for Renzi's reforms), the oppositions (berlusoni and grillo) are getting stronger, and Renzi's enemies inside the party kept asking him to get involved in the government instead of criticizing it (so he could lose his popularity and they have more chances to regain the majority of the party in the next round).  

Why did he do exactly what all his enemies (berlusconi, grillo, his party minority) wanted?  

Three things:  
- He's popular, but if he goes to elections without a new election law he won't still be able to gain the majority of the parliament, and there's the chance that his party will lose seats too.  
- The current government seems unable to survive for another year and that will sink his reforms plan    
- He's very ambitious and thinks he will be able to make it through, but the popular opinion is that he's committing political suicide. Now he has to deal with a coalition similar to the one that didn't work for Letta, a country that's still in recession, and will be under the constant attack of two populist forces (Berlusconi and Grillo) that have a really strong grip on the public opinion (with the help of Italian medias that love to throw kerosene on the fire and know that populism sells)

Incorrect. Here are the figures from the [UK government's own website](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Pages/Home.aspx):

- The UK’s EU exports for December 2013 total £11.6 billion.
- The UK’s EU imports for December 2013 total £16.7 billion. 
- The UK’s non-EU exports for December 2013 are £12.5 billion. 
- The UK’s non-EU imports for December 2013 are £13.9 billion. 

So if you compare the UK's EU and non-EU exports, we get 48% UK exports going to the EU (11.6 + 12.5 billion = 24.1 billion total UK exports, divided by 11.6 billion)

&gt;Irrespective, as part of EFTA trade would continue unaffected (negotiated according to Lisbon Treaty TEU Article 50 according to the EU ""law""). The growing supra-national entity that is the EU requires a vote on the political aspects of it's influence over the UK.

This is laughably wrong. First of all, the UK is *not part* of EFTA - it's an EU member state. The two are not the same. Exiting the EU would not mean that the UK would automatically join or revert to EFTA membrship - it would need to apply to join EFTA, which would take time.

Next, let's look at Switzerland and Norway, which are part of EFTA.

You do realize that both pay in to the EU budget proportionate to their economies, right? Norway currently pays about 340 million euros per annum, **making it the 10th biggest contributor.** In addition, EU members get money back, reducing their net contributions, while EFTA members don't. France for example gets roughly its contribution to the EU budget back via agricultural subsidies to its farmers. The UK also has access to billions of Euros in various funds, which it could tap into if it so chooses (i.e. to help pay for the flooding the UK is experiencing)
 
Rough maths tells us that, all things being equal, as the UK’s GDP is approximately 5.7 times that of Norway’s, **the UK would still need to contribute around 2 billion euros a year to the EU budget if part of the EEA/EFTA.** 
 
Second, both Norway and Switzerland also – without having any say in their formulation – **have to abide by 80-90% of EU rules and regulations in order to be part of the Common Market.**

So your brilliant plan to join EFTA would mean that, paradoxically, the UK would pay *more* (the UK's current contribution to the EU budget is €3.5 billion, not including the funds it gets back or has access to, like EU Solidarity funds), still need to abide by 80 - 90% of EU rules and regulations, yet **have absolutely no say in the creation of these laws**

true,emergency_poncho,EURO,European Union,"the whole question of referendums is very tricky. On the one hand, referendums appear to be the bastion and foundation of a democratic system, since it gives the people the ability to vote directly on important issues. Anyone who argues against a referendum is easily painted in a negative light, as anti-democratic, as an elite who doesn't want to give average people a say in political decisions, etc...

On the other hand, referendums are not so black-and-white, and can be very dangerous. The fact is that the average person doesn't follow politics very closely, and often has not spent the time and effort to get the facts and create an informed decision. I don't mean to disparage the intelligence of the average preson, but it's just a fact: most people are too busy, or aren't interested in politics, or simply have better things to do than read endless studies, articles, press stories, etc... So you have masses of people that make an emotional decision, rather than a rational one, and are easily swayed by fire-brand, populist politicians like Nigel Farage, UKIP leader.

Look at the French referendum to block the EU Constitution. The French have historically been some of the strongest supporters of the EU and further integration. The French benefit enormously from the EU: the Common Agricultural Policy accounts for €60 billion, of which €10.5 billion (roughly 20%) go to French farmers. So why did they vote No in the referendum? Simply because the French President of the time, Chirac, was immensely unpopular with voters (for reasons completely unrelated to the EU), and therefore EU voters wanted to punish him, which they did via the referendum (he had staked his political career on the vote, and resigned shortly after).

So in many cases, in a referendum, voters aren't voting rationally on the issue at hand, but rather make an uninformed, emotional decision, and often use the referendum strategically to vote on other issues.

By far the biggest problems with UK people who want to exit the EU is their absolute lack of alternatives or solutions. No person advocating an exit of the EU has ever proposed a viable alternative. I merely rebutted your attempt, by highlighting how wrong your factually incorrect statements about how Article 50 TEU states that the UK is somehow part of EFTA, and other incorrect trade figures really are.

None of your bullet points above mean anything. 

- Trade percentage of the UK with EU/non-EU? I just quoted the exact numbers, as published by the UK government.
- budget contributions are notoriously tricky to calculate, since they are so complex. It's true that the UK is a net contributor, but it has the famous 'UK rebate' (negotiated by Thatcher) worth £5 billion. At the end of the day, it costs every UK citizen less than £150 per year to remain a member (that's £12.5 a month) - a small price to pay for the enormous trade benefits the UK gets. Ever wonder why the City of London lobbies so aggressively for the UK to stay in the EU? Because it knows how lucrative being an EU member is.
- I'm sorry, EFTA contributions are not voluntary. What are you smoking? Wherever did you get this preposterous fact? This is categorically not true.
- your last point is also ridiculous. Norway and Switzerland **have ZERO say** on EU rules and regulations they have to follow. ZERO. 

Here's how it works. When the EU member states get together to create new regulations or laws, if a particular document is relevant to EFTA (80-90% are), then this is marked at the top of the document. These documents are forwarded to Switzerland/Norway, whose national parliaments transpose them into national law. End of story. No negotiations, no discussions, nothing.

http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/agendas/

avec en particulier [l'ordre du jour](http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/agendas/odj.asp) et un menu pas mal avec les feuilles vertes, feuilles jaunes et feuilleton. Et surtout [l'État d'avancement](http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/documents/index-dossier.asp) des dossiers. Un calendrier auquel je ne comprends rien [ici](http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/seance/previsionnel.asp)

D'un côté je suis content parce qu'ils bossent vraiment sur pleins de trucs, et que toutes les données sont disponibles. D'un autre c'est flippant parce qu'on n'en entend pas du tout parler...

Don't forget, UK leaders started this by saying the Scots aren't going to have the pound. Salmond is just reacting to this threat. And his logic is impeccable: ""no shared liabilities without shared assets""

Moreover, in the event of a yes-vote, both sides will sit down to discuss the terms of the currency union, there can be no doubt about it because it is in the interest of both sides. Thus, the announcement by UK leaders is to make (if you don't like the term bully) the Scots vote no to independence.

true,emergency_poncho,EURO,European Union,"3 out of 4 items in your list are directly related to the Crisis, which originated in the US and essentially hit every country in the world. It has nothing to do with the EU, as evidenced by the fact that non-EU countries in Europe and around the world also suffered terribly due to the crisis. It's quite silly to blame the EU for an international crisis which was caused by the US.

Countries which were particularly hit were those with irresponsible national fiscal policies, over which the EU has 0 control. Greece, Italy, Spain, etc... were borrowing irresponsibly for years, even well before their entrance to the EU. Similarly, certain EU countries like Germany, the Netherlands, the Nordic countries, etc... had for years very responsible fiscal policies, and were hit less hard and recovered faster. All of this has absolutely nothing to do with the EU -  these are national policies, determined 100% by national governments. I repeat, this is NOT an EU issue. National budgets are simply not within EU competence.

The lack of democracy in the EU is a tired old argument worth very little. Let's look at the 4 most powerful EU institutions: the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers, the European Union Council, and the Commission.

1. European Parliament: directly elected by EU citizens. Gained an enormous amount of power with the Lisbon Treaty.
2. Council of Ministers: national ministers convening to create EU policy. These national ministers are all elected, as they form part of their national governments.
3. European Union Council: composed of heads of state/government. Again, all are elected at the national level.
4. European Commission: least democratic institution, as its officials are not directly elected. However, the 28 Commissioners (one for each member state) are appointed by national governments, and must have approval of the European Parliament. In addition, Commission takes very few strategic political decisions: it merely conducts technocratic studies to provide data for the real decision-makers (the European Parliament and the Council), or they propose legislation, which once again is amended and decided by the European Parliament and the Council. If either of these 2 bodies opposes a Commission initiative, then the initiative is rejected.

So 3 out of 4 EU institutions are **directly elected**, and the 4th is a technocratic institution, subordinate to its political masters.

These people exist, I can regrettably say I know some of them. Same goes for politicians. It's the same people that will destroy a McDonalds because ""fuck capitalism"". 

It's the same people that will throw chairs at the police station in Ciutat Vella because ""Gamonal"".

They have no place in our society, and the police has the means to fight them. 

The big problem is that these people will often mix up with your regular joe protester, the police charges, people get hurt and shit.

This is not only the police fault. They fuck up sometimes, and the ""antidisturbis"" are often blood thirsty bastards. But you'd probably be if you had that amount of shit flying at you.

I don't think the police owning guns has led to any major problem, not one I can come up with, at least. And it has surely saved some lives.

Social inequality and poverty isn't the only factor leading to crime, which you will notice when you see all these people I'm talking about will go back home after throwing molotov's at the police, and they certainly have a roof and a hot meal.

1. It has always spent more than it has
2. Joining the Eurozone amplified problem 1; it did not create a new problem
3. The influx of money was taken away

This was the initial problem. They spent more money than they had, and then the money they could borrow stopped being available. I would definitely say that 'spending more money than you have' is part of your culture. Be it through the state of mind about priorities of quality of life over financial risks, or anything else. 

Later on the additional problem became that they would have to change this 'spending more money than you have'-problem, which is changing the entire culture of Greece (that is, changing their priority from quality of life to financial rightness). How is that not culture?

Obviously I picked Greece as an example because their 'spending more than you have'-culture has been the strongest. And hence, they are the only country still not rebounding. Seems that so far the 'culture'-argument suffices.

Well, the UK is not part of the Eurozone, so I don't really see the point. It's like saying that Argentina suffers the same problem (which it does, by the way). Then regarding France; why is it that their credit has not been hampered? Is it, perhaps, because the people lending money to these countries had more faith in France than Greece? And if so, why? Is it because France has never had any financial problems before, so it has proven that the country is able to secure the money? And if a country is able to prove such a thing, how is that not part of the country's culture?

Of course they are people, and I have huge sympaties for the ""good guys"" in there. Having to work within a broken system.

Destroying property is being done because it feels like a last resort. No one listens to you and then you have to hit them where it hurts, financially. I am of the opinion that destroying ""property"" is not violence. As long as it is targeted and not random, mom and pop stores. But I get that this is an issue that a lot of people view differently and I can fully understand that. 

Regarding ""bad apples in crowds"" you are right, there often are agitators who are there  simply to fight. They are usually in a very small number though. And it is also fairly common knowledge that police forces plant undercover agents to agitate things. This is a very normal tactic.

The problem is the system itself, that allows this to happen. And the problem with the people who actively fight to keep it running is simply that, they think they are just doing their jobs. But they are quite obviously working against the people. I would point to social inequality, global poverty, the fact that 85 people own as much has half the population, enviromental disaster, and the list goes on(I bring these larger issues in since economy is so globally intertwined now that it really goes from a local to a global level).

[Here](http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_gdp_gro_dur_198_200-gdp-growth-duration-1980-2000) is a link which measures GDP growth for the past 20 years.  

Apart from Romania, the **lowest** European country on that list, with only 18% aggregated GDP growth since 1980, is Switzerland - NOT an EU country. Romania only joined a few years ago, and accession was probably a mistake.

The 2nd lowest, with 34% GDP growth since 1980, is Greece. All other EU countries are well above that, and some countries (ireland, Luxembourg, and Cyprus) have more than doubled their GDP in the last 30 years. Decline of GDP? You must be joking.

According to [this document on the Internal Market](http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/publications/docs/20years/achievements-web_en.pdf), page 15 of the document, EU-27 GDP in 2008 was 2.13% higher (or €233 billion) than it would have been without the creation of the internal market.

In 1992, before the creation of the Single Market, intra-EU trade was €800 billion. This number has exploded to €2 800 billion in 2011, thanks to the Single Market. The Single Market has also made the EU more attractive to foreign direct investment (FDI), and has seen an explosion from €500 billion in 1992 to €730 billion in 2008.

[Here](http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/publications/docs/20years/key-points-web_en.pdf) is yet another source which confirms these numbers.

I am producing numbers and data to support my argument. You have yet to produce anything.

While I applaud your attempt (UK in EFTA), that argument was quite thoroughly disproved.

I think it's the opposite. If they become a monetary union without a fiscal union, then the UK will have control over Scotland's monetary policy without having to guarantee any of its debts. Scotland will then have the same problems that all the ""peripheral"" Eurozone countries have now.

true,modulus,EURO,European Union,"I generally agree with your line of argument, but there are some bits where you go too far imo:

&gt; Countries which were particularly hit were those with irresponsible national fiscal policies, over which the EU has 0 control. Greece, Italy, Spain, etc... were borrowing irresponsibly for years, even well before their entrance to the EU. Similarly, certain EU countries like Germany, the Netherlands, the Nordic countries, etc... had for years very responsible fiscal policies, and were hit less hard and recovered faster. All of this has absolutely nothing to do with the EU - these are national policies, determined 100% by national governments. I repeat, this is NOT an EU issue. National budgets are simply not within EU competence.

1) Can't speak for many other countries, but Spain before the crisis had a very low debt to gdp. This article from the economist, not exactly a pinko source points it out: http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2010/05/debt_crisis_7

2) To say that the crisis has *nothing* to do with the Union is also overstating matters. First, because capital inflows and the low interest regime from the ECB definitely have to do with the Union. Second, because the austerity strategy (as opposed to counter-cyclical keynesian stimulus) was agreed in Union institutions. Third, because the ECB's decisions had a significant role in the deteriorating fiscal and financial manoeuverability of member states until Draghi said they would do ""all it takes"". If it had been done in 2008 we wouldn't have a lot of the problems we do, as the deficit increases in Spain are largely related to increased rates on public debt. Fourth, there is a problem with having a common currency area without some form of fiscal transfers, and the ECB has been too obsessed by Germany's inflation fetish to stimulate growth in the more marginal economies.

3) To say that France and Germany were responsible in comparison is pretty funny considering that while they were violating the stability pact (in the mid 2000s) Spain had budget surpluses. The Union didn't scream about these violations the way it suddenly got worried about deficits after the crisis though.

4) National budgets are somewhat linked to EU competencies through the Maastricht criteria. However, enforcement and fuss about violation of these has been uneven, basically fine when France or Germany do it but not weaker states. Likewise, instruments like the fiscal pact come to decrease manoeuverability of already troubled states to very contestable benefit (if any).

&gt; The lack of democracy in the EU is a tired old argument worth very little. Let's look at the 4 most powerful EU institutions: the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers, the European Union Council, and the Commission.

This is also somewhat true but not to the extent you claim, in my view. The EP has acquired more power in Lisbon, but not enormously more power, though those changes are welcome. The council of ministers is fine.

However, the Commission and the EU Council are indirectly elected. There's a formalism, called Banzhaf power index, which shows that in such indirect methods of election democracy is diluted in that the power of citizens decreases. The EU Council contains heads of government that are largely the result of parliamentary processes in the member states, so the minorities have no representation to speak of, and the Commission is even more indirectly elected. Also you minimise the powers of the Commission, which has an effective monopoly on legislative initiative.

The truth is the EU's democratic setup is deficient. We have a parliament that cannot initiate legislation, that requires supermajorities to demand accountability from the EC, a government, the Council, that also lacks this initiative, and a civil service (the Commission) which practically controls the direction of the Union's policies. This not to speak of an institution you left out, the ECB, which is entirely beyond democratic control (whether you think this is a good or a bad thing is another issue).

In fact it is surprising that the Union functions as well as it does, and the Commission is a tremendously competent and capable bureaucracy, and we need something like it, but that doesn't make it a particularly democratic way to run things.

This... really isn't how currencies work. 

A country can't just devalue its currency like that and not expect to be severely punished by international markets. 

If Scotland goes for a currency of its own, it'll still have to take on its share of the debt denominated in pounds- it can devalue its currency relative to the pound all it likes, but markets will only accept payment in said currency if the exchange rate is sensible.

And it's not only the politicians of the countries that got the short end of the stick that are to blame. One also has to wonder why, say, German politicians told the Germans that there would be no bailouts when they knew the inevitability of all this.

No. I'm saying that the Scottish government has not asked the other member states. It is the other member states who will need to accept Scotland's membership of the EU.

Besides  there are many aspects in which Scotland can make life uncomfortable back such as, well, reneging on the debt, kicking the nuclear deterrent out immediately so not allowing time for a replacement base to be built, having no compunction about under-cutting the rUK on taxes*. That's before you consider the possibility of hundreds of thousands of economically maligned, highly educated Scots leaving behind the economy that Westminster trashed out of spite and moving in to England. Remember that, in all likelihood, they'll continue to be British Citizens and so have the vote and every right in the world to move South so there'll be not a thing they could do to prevent it. Not sure how that would go down with the electorate given the high levels of unemployment at the moment.

true,Orsenfelt,SCOT,Scotland,"Honestly I think Salmond, whilst being a little petty, has a point.

We've been told by this Tory government time and time again that we shouldn't leave because this union is like a marriage and how we built everything we have together. That we all have part ownership of all things British.

The YES campaign acknowledged that and accepted part ownership of the debt. We built it together, we'll take our fair share it's only right.

It was *assumed* that would be true of everything, we don't need to carve it up and change ownership but we aren't **abandoning** things we own 8% of, it's a divorce. There should be discussions and an honest attempt at deciding the best way for that 8% to be made available. 

There seems to be a general opinion that these types of things are owned by 'The British' and that the 'The British' are graciously allowing Scots to use it. Which is a bit patronising given the above, the marriage and togetherness crap they spouted at the start of every speech. I thought we were British? I guess I was wrong.

Should these 'British' things automatically revert to full English/Welsh/NI control after independence? We keep being told we built those things together *but* then told not to touch them because they don't belong to us when we're thinking about leaving. 

Pound Sterling (it's reputation as well as influence over it) is an asset built by the union, just like our roads or foreign embassies are. Nothing can be done about our split of the roads, it'd be nice to come to an arrangement on the embassies.. so why can't we discuss what happens to our 8% influence over Pound Sterling? Even if it turns out it won't work why take the harsh stance and flat out say it won't happen now, months before the vote?

So Salmond's position is if you won't allow us our 8% control, won't even talk about it.. then we won't discuss our 8% of the debt. There are two sides to this, there are things rUK could negotiate and just closing down/rejected completely isn't going to help either side. So if you want it all, take it.. including all the shite.

------

Not taking the debt is a terrible idea and nobody thinks a currency union would be easy but coming out and saying *""No it'll never happen, it's ours and you can fuck off""* isn't in the spirit of the Edinburgh agreement and doesn't show any respect at-all for the role of Scots in this union. It's such a sudden an extreme position, contrary to everything the NO campaign has said up to this point that Salmond is ridiculing it by taking his own. 

Salmond is just trying to play hardball, trying to counter the deafening cries of ""*Can't have it both ways*"" from the NO campaign by showing that rUK also can't have it both ways. Of course it is in a way hypocritical (He's claiming 100% ownership of the oil) but he's not the one out there every day trying to pal it up with Scots and claim we're all equal then kicking us out with nothing when we think about leaving.

Either everything Britain does is done by all 4 nations *or* Britain is just England with tag-alongs. Culturally the latter has been true for a very long time, it's now clear that the current government thinks it's the case politically too (Whilst also trying to get you to believe the former so you'll vote no)

Czechoslovakia was for some 40 years ruled by the communists. They believed gypsy problem is merely social and can be solved that way. Change their economical and social conditions and they will surely change their behaviour, in short.

Every gypsy had to be employed (everybody has to) and manual labour they usually did was (for ideological reasons) paid much better than e.g. technicians or teachers. The state even set up special projects fitting gypsy distaste of direct supervision by the gadje (e.g. massive drainage of agricultural land in 70's and 80's).

Their kids had to go to schools (massive change, almost none did between the wars). Antisocial behaviour was not tolerated. Criminality was kept extremely low. 

Ghettoization was not allowed. Subsidized flats were given in the middle of cities. Settlements were created where ethnic Czechs or Slovaks would live in harmony with the gypsies. Lunik IX was one such settlement.

An no, I'm sorry. You're wrong. That's not a confirmation bias, just the confirmation for the nth time of a widely know fact. Let's quote Milton Friedman about the “interest rate fallacy”:

&gt; “After the U.S. experience during the Great Depression, and after inflation and rising interest rates in the 1970s and disinflation and falling interest rates in the 1980s, I thought the fallacy of identifying tight money with high interest rates and easy money with low interest rates was dead. Apparently, old fallacies never die.”

But if you read [this interview](http://byznys.ihned.cz/zpravodajstvi/c1-57867400-jak-z-krize-dat-lidem-penize-a-oslabit-korunu)  with the new head of the CNB, Miroslav Singer:

&gt; “We talked about it in the central bank’s board about what the central bank can buy and put the money into circulation. What all can lend and – in extreme case - we can simply hand out money to citizens. Something that is sometimes referred to as “throwing money from a helicopter.” If it really was needed, it seems to be the easiest to move the exchange rate. It is logical for the country, which exports the products of eighty per cent of its GDP. If we felt that in our country there is a long deflationary pressures, the obvious way to deal with it is through a weakening currency.”

Miroslav Singer well understands that he is not out of ammunition – that is a refreshing view from a European central banker. Kudos to him and for his big success!

The NO campaign frequently conflicts with this viewpoint. It bends over backwards to tell us that 'Britain' is the union of 4, that we're equal partners, don't leave because you'll break up the union, destroy the thing we built together...etc etc etc. 

*Yet* when push comes to shove and an actual issue comes up suddenly Britain, as a concept, has absolutely nothing to do with the Scots and it'll just revert in full to England and carry on. Scotland? Oh they just left no biggie.

It's a union in name only, the political class as well as quite a large portion of the country don't actually think we have any claim to *any* of it but they'll still get up and make speeches to the contrary to secure a vote and keep the union together.

It's like.. say you and I baked a cake together. You put in ~8% of the effort/ingredients/etc and I kept telling you that your effort was appreciated and that it wouldn't be the same cake if you weren't there. Then when it was done and you wanted to take a slice home I said ""*No, this is my cake*"".

8% of the cake of Britain is ours, so we keep being told, that means you don't get to just decide what happens to our slice of it for us. You can't just say *""Nah I don't want the cake cut, doesn't work for me""* then shut the door in my face. Salmond is saying if you want to act like that then we're not going to give you the money we owe for the ingredients. There are consequences to not playing Salmond's nicey-nicey game, it's not all just about what the UK 'grants' to Scotland.

Like I said, a currency union might not work. That's fine but we should discuss it, find out what will work. Don't just swan up like you own the place and lay down the law.

I'm sorry but it simply isn't up to the Scottish people in this case! Its not up for discussion (according to the current UK government) That's it the harsh reality of independence, if you leave the Union you leave everything.

&gt;Don't just swan up like you own the place and lay down the law.

Don't particularly like the tone here. Its not about laying down the law, its just how things are. Not even Salmond is debating Westminster's right to reject a currency union because he knows they are totally within their rights to rule it out given a yes vote. They are the British government deciding what is best for the British people after Scotland leaves, it's their choice, not Scotland's.

On another note, I totally understand Scotland's attachment to the pound. Its more than just a currency, its part of your culture and national identity, something we all know the Scottish feel very strongly about. Which is why this news has touched so many nerves. But its important that the Scotts know that the loss of the pound is a legitimate outcome of independence. And they will need to take this into account when deciding which way to cast their vote. I personally hope the Scottish people chose to stay part of Britain.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm not sure the UK is exactly beholden to the ECB nor the monetary union I was discussing, seen as we're not part of the eurozone, in which case I'm not sure how your point applies. 

In the case of France, I wont dispute that their fiscal affairs are by no means perfect, however a) how much of that is down to the financial commitments they've made to the ECB and monetary union in regards to faltering PIIGS economies and b) If their financial affairs are now faltering, does it not then make all the more sense to cut off the crisis economies on the eurozones periphery from the monetary union so as to prevent this credit drain?

Of course, I'd ideally love to see a strong fiscal union with everybody involved, however I'm just skeptical of whether the politics of the EU can make that a reality.

&gt; This, incidentally, is the main reason why the acronym PIIGS magically ceased to be used since around 2010, once the global financial crisis made it quite clear that this problem wasn't connected with the prejudice shared by some

I'm not sure what your getting at here, but I hope you're not trying to insinuate my comment was prejudice simply because I use the term ""PIIGS"".

&gt;

&gt;**Ranibizumab** (trade name **Lucentis**) is a [monoclonal antibody](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody) fragment ([Fab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_antigen-binding)) derived from the same parent mouse antibody as [bevacizumab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab) (Avastin). It is much smaller than the parent molecule and has been [affinity matured](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_maturation) to provide stronger binding to [VEGF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor)-A. It is an [anti-angiogenic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-angiogenics) that has been approved to treat the ""wet"" type of age-related [macular degeneration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration) (AMD, also ARMD), a common form of age-related [vision loss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_loss).

&gt;Ranibizumab sells for a significantly higher price when compared to bevacizumab. Clinical trials have shown both to be equally effective; however there were some reports of infection after dividing bevacizumab into smaller doses.

&gt;Ranibizumab was developed by [Genentech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genentech) and is marketed in the United States by Genentech and elsewhere by [Novartis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis), under the brand name Lucentis.

I can see why it would appear that Osborne is playing hard ball. In fact it wouldn't surprise me if that was part of the motivation behind the announcement. 

However at the same time if they had already discussed the possibility of a currency union and then rejected it there would be no reason to not announce it. Its important that the Scottish people know this before they vote. What is equally important is how the Scots view this announcement. If it comes across as an attempt to ""bullly"" them into a yes vote, then I have no doubt that such a tactic would backfire. At the same time this does not mean that the announcement was meant to come across in this way. I think it likely that the Gov just wanted to move the debate along and inform the people of Scotland that they had already made a decision on rejecting currency union. While in the back of their minds I have no doubt they hoped it would help the no vote. 

So I see both sides of the argument in this case. The fact of the matter is, with a split on the table there was always going to be some conflict as the referendum grew nearer.

&gt;Fine, then Britain keeps the debt.

Either way, this retort is definitely pretty childish and unrealistic of Salmond.

In the post independence negotiations no politician would even entertain the idea of Scotland not taking their share of the debts.

When my parents bought olives they would sometimes offer me one and the first time I tasted one I was grossed out. The second time I was still grossed out. The third time I was still grossed out. The fourth time I thought 'man this one does look tasty with the filling and stuff'. I tasted it and was still grossed out. I have never been able to actually swallow one. I've changed my opinion on some food as I grew older but I am positive I will never like olives.""

Le fantastiche olive americane.

Insomma, a me pare evidentissimo che ci sia un deficit di cultura alimentare proprio grossolano, o forse, più probabilmente, l'ambiente americano procura cibi e ingredienti veramente scarsi, tanto che si viene a considerare l'aragosta ""burro fuso"", le olive una merda e il pomodoro una schifezza acquosa.

&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm not sure the UK is exactly beholden to the ECB nor the monetary union I was discussing, seen as we're not part of the eurozone, in which case I'm not sure how your point applies. 

It looks like you've missed the fact that the problem isn't the eurozone or sharing a common currency, but the way these countries have been run based on borrowing cheap cash.  The UK is being mismanaged just as the set of countries you've referred to as PIIGS have been (arguably worse, in fact) and this problem can't pin this mismanagement on the eurozone.  

Conversely, the eurozone is packed with members which have been managed better than the UK and whose finances are healthier.

So, it's quite clear that the eurozone isn't the problem, nor its cause.

&gt; In the case of France, I wont dispute that their fiscal affairs are by no means perfect, however a) how much of that is down to the financial commitments they've made to the ECB and monetary union in regards to faltering PIIGS economies and b) If their financial affairs are now faltering, does it not then make all the more sense to cut off the crisis economies on the eurozones periphery from the monetary union so as to prevent this credit drain?

Again, you've missed the fact that the problem isn't the eurozone or common currency.  Again, the UK is arguably in as bad a shape as France and worse than Ireland, and you can't pin that problem on the ECB or eurozone.

The cause of this problem is quite clear: there was access to cheap money, governments took advantage of this, but now that the money is no longer cheap these governments are forced to readjust, with all the economic impact which is associated with such a readjustment.

You're trying to pin the blame on an imaginary scapegoat which happens to fit your prejudice, but your scapegoat contrasts with reality.

&gt; I'm not sure what your getting at here, but I hope you're not trying to insinuate my comment was prejudice simply because I use the term ""PIIGS"". 

I'm not insinuating.  The whole concept of these ""PIIGS"" is based on nothing more than prejudice.  This fact became all too clear once countries such as UK and France started to experience the exact same problems pinned on the PIIGS acronym, and suddenly PIIGS ceased to exist and instead all there ever existed was a ""global financial crisis"", which was somehow unavoidable and somehow no one ever saw it coming, let alone the effects of running countries based on debt.",0,1392390486,null,0,false,0,cff7g6e,t3_1xvxt1,t1_cff7g6e,t1_cff6qmw,null,1432395356,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I finding really hard to believe that over 30% of Chinese live better than the average romanian.

Highway construction seems to be going OK also in Romania. 100 km/year is a good rate (at least in my opinion). This means that in 10 year Romania will have an OK highway infrastructure. 10 years is not that much.

China is able to build so much infrastructure because they don't care too much about quality/safety. Just google ""highway collapse china""",0,1392391333,null,0,1392391877,0,cff7rko,t3_1xw21m,t1_cff7rko,t1_cff7muh,null,1435500722,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Furthermore you are exaggerating it completely out of proportion, I said.

&gt; Finland doesn't focus on capitalism and shallow notions of ""economic growth"" as much as other nations do...


Which is true.


I never said in a capitalist world generic economic growth was a useless thing, it is simply useless to depict anything other than what it is, a capital-centric measurement which has no real bearing on what the situation is in the country as a whole in the real world, it is simply used as a buzz word within the limited sphere of capitalist interests, it has little meaning elsewhere.


You can take your high GDP and run your country as you will, it doesn't make your country prosperous even if it's through the roof, what is that GDP made up of? What kinds of benefits or social structure do you have? Who is it that contributes to that GDP, who doesn't, why? By how much? Why so much/little?
Is GDP relevant at all to the prosperity of the nation? Not much no, which is my point.


GDP means essentially nothing unless you supply all the other periphery information, which means the idea of using 'economic growth' is both misleading and frankly misguided.

So I ask, what other solution you see if immigration is bad for poor countries and open borders are causing issues for the other side? You also cannot intervene/help from the outside on how a country will manage itself internally because you cannot over-step your sovereignty. These are sometimes governments that are ripe with corruption, incompetence, nepotism and will have no desire or incentive to improve their people's status.

My argument is that problems caused by open borders are not immovable and can be somewhat controlled by the receiving country. Police needs to be prompt and fair, they need to do their jobs more actively than they are used to in a society with little to no crime - collect beggars, jail time for repeat offenders, harsh punishment for petty crimes, etc. Same for skilled immigrants - enforce minimum wages to protect local workers, prosecute anyone who tries to go around said wages, and so on. 

Of course this will create some ripples for the local population, but they can be mitigated, controlled, and I think this is the shortest route to minimising the gap between 3rd, 2nd and 1st world regions. With the current trend, I honestly expect for Europe to be economically homogenous within the next 20 years. That means there will be no difference or incentive to move anywhere within the EU except for personal preference - and though these 20 years mean a good chunk of my life, I'm happy that our children will be able to tap into the brain power of a much larger viable society. 

Closing your borders will not fix anything, it just sweeps the problems under the rug and moves them for the next generation to handle them. Instead, I suggest complaining to your gov about how they handle (or better yet, how they don't handle) these issues internally.

The internal economy isn't, as opposed to the common belief, reliant on large corporations to keep the nation running, this is an illusion made to focus governments to more lenient corporate taxes and laws.
Following that thought today most significant economic throughput revolves around large corporations making money from natural resources or sales of highly unnecessary or redundant products which nobody needs, the economic throughput is essentially majorly contributed to by irrelevant production and then in contrast virtually unpaid workers when looking at the actual figures involved.


Since prosperity is the important factor there is no need to increase this economic growth for a rational mind as all it does is artificially alter a number without benefiting the people much at all, simply equating economic growth to corporate profiteering can be made here.


You will gain more prosperity by actually focusing on humanistic and social areas instead of trying to increase the economic throughput and hope for something to trickle down on the citizens.


As such it does not follow the interest group of most Finns since the large focus is prosperity(not wealth as such although it of course is a part to a degree), as in physical well being; Hence the welfare system, healthcare, education and other things which are more important in Finland over private profiteering opportunities.


The notions of increases in how much money is in circulation within, essentially corporations within the nation's borders as a whole is largely an artificial statistic meant only for private economic interests who are looking for trends of capitalist friendly investment opportunities.
This economic growth is largely also meant for any lenders of money to depict the positive economic state of a nation in a business sense, there is little interest in real prosperity in this department.


Economic Growth/GDP, are things of largely inconsequential meaning for anyone who is focused on actual progress rather than profiteering.

Ricordo di aver letto (non sono sicuro al 100% se fosse vero) che una volta le aragoste le servivano ai carcerati nei posti dove ne avevano troppe, tanto che i carcerati si lamentavano del fatto che mangiavano sempre quello. Poi chiaramente il demand è cresciuto e le cose son cambiate.

Però il tutto mi fa riflettere su quanto la percezione del cibo sia anche influenzata da tanti fattori esterni al sapore del cibo stesso. Per esempio, hanno fatto diversi blind test dove hanno scoperto che la maggior parte della gente preferisce il sapore della Pepsi a quello della CocaCola perché leggermente più dolce. Ovviamente però poi tutti prendono la CocaCola, perché la CocaCola rimane la CocaCola. Ecco, mi chiedo quanto valga lo stesso col cibo ""di lusso"". Quanto viene influenzata la nostra percezione dal fatto che stiamo pagando una certa cifra piuttosto che un'altra? A me tanto per fare un esempio aragoste e capesante non fanno impazzire per nulla, sono ok, ma non mi sembra che valgano il livello di fama che hanno. Sarei curioso di capire in questo senso se sono l'unico che la pensa così.

With reports of even marginal increases in support for the Yes campaign, the Westminster parties got scared, not because one or two percent in the 30's signalled a credible threat itself but because the psychological effect of voting Yes being more acceptable as time goes on helps the Yes campaign.

So the Westminster parties all agreed that something needed to be done and they chose a key policy, something that is heavily linked to the most contested issues in the debate, they categorically stated that this option would not be allowed. This whole thing is very obviously an attempt to sew uncertainty in the voters minds, hoping that the increase in Yes supporters will be viewed in the future as an anomaly.

Do I think that a currency Union would be back on the table in the event of a Yes vote? Long answer yes, the Westminster parties would start to look at the whole issue in terms of the best interests of the UK, so they'd start talking about how they have miraculously came up with a way for such a thing to work.

Thing is, they are banking on *never* being called out on this, if they can present a dismal enough picture of Independence they can claim whatever they like with the assurance that they'll never have their assertions proven false.

The currency Union is a massive story right now and if they were to go back on it tomorrow there'd be ridicule, give it 7 months though and the position will be an accepted one that -while set- is more open to negotiation.

 A Yes vote would destroy the SNP, it has been an umbrella party holding together disparate ideologies under the banner of future independence and the achievement of that goal would leave everyone divided.

 With a No vote the SNP stands as a Scotish-centric party in a political arena devoid of actual opponents.

true,armyn1,BRAN,Brandenburg,"Hinter der ganzen Empörung ist dennoch anzumerken, dass immer noch die Unschuldsvermutung gilt! Hier gleich von ""Pädophilen"" zu sprechen ist fragwürdig. Es ist immer noch unklar, warum ein Spitzenpolitiker, der seit Jahren eine steile Karriere macht und gerade durch die NSU-Aufklärung im Fokus der Öffentlichkeit stand, mit seinem eigenen Namen und Kreditkarten-Daten fröhlich in Pädo-Shops einkaufen geht. 
Die andere Seite ist, dass Edathy  als äußerst scharfer Kritiker von Verfassungsschutz und Kriminalpolizei bekannt wurde und deren Leute hart in die Mangel genommen während der Untersuchungsausschüsse. Dieser Fakt wird unter dem ganzen Skandal-Geschrei in den Medien mehr und mehr verdrängt. 
Die Frage die ich mir stelle ist, warum warnte Friedrich die politische Konkurrenz? Sonst wird jede Schwäche genutzt, um Rücktritt beim Gegner zu schreien. Und hier riskierte Friedrich sein Amt um die SPD vor einem Skandal zu warnen? Das ist doch alles extrem merkwürdig. 
Würde ich mir meine persönliche Verschwörungstheorie zusammen basteln, würde die so aussehen: 
Wie alle Institutionen des Bundesrepublik gab es große personelle Kontinuitäten zu deren NS-Vorläufern. Beim Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz, dass 1950 gegründet wurde, war dies extrem ausgeprägt. Die Amerikaner nahmen sich Gestapo-Leute um gegen die KPD zu ermitteln. Zwar wurde auf eine Trennung von Polizei und Geheimdienst besonders wert gelegt, um eine neue Gestapo zu verhindern, allerdings ließ man deren Leute weitermachen, um gegen den Kommunismus vorzugehen. Heinz Fromm, Präsident des BfV, berief 2009 (endlich) eine Kommission um die braune Vergangenheit aufzuarbeiten. Bis heute gibt es laut Wikipedia keinen Abschlussbericht. Es ist bekannt, dass braune Eliten in transparenteren Institutionen der BRD lange weiter arbeiten konnten. Bei so einem geheimen Verein, wie einem Nachrichtendienst, könnte dieser Einfluss noch viel stärker gewesen sein, da viel mehr Dinge der Geheimhaltung unterliegen. Angenommen die Gestapo-Verfassungsschützer haben auch kurz vor ihrer Rente wieder Gleichgesinnte eingestellt, um den braunen Charakter des Amtes zu bewahren. Verbunden mit der Undurchsichtigkeit dieser Behörde könnte NS-Gedankengut bis in die 90er eine Rolle gespielt haben. Diese Leute steuerten durch das V-Mann System Neonazis für ihre Zwecke, um Deutschland in der Öffentlichkeit zu einem unsympathischen Ort für ""Nicht-Bio-Deutsche"" zu machen. Nun drohte durch den Selbstmord der Nazis alles heraus zukommen, deswegen wurden, wie allgemein bekannt, unzählige Akten in den Behörden vernichtet. Blöd nur, dass ein Beamter direkt an einem Tatort eines NSU-Mordes war und dies bekannt wurde. Und blöd nur, dass ein potentieller Zeuge, der beim LKA eine Aussage zu den staatlichen Hintermännern des NSU machen wollte, sich 1 1/2 km vor der Polizei selbst umbringt, indem er sich selbst verbrennt. (wtf!) 
Wenn wir es nun mit einer braunen Clique in dem Amt zu tun haben, passte es dieser Gruppe garantiert nicht, dass ein Sozialdemokrat namens Edathy ihren Mitarbeitern ordentlich in den Arsch trat vor den Ausschüssen und nie den Ehrgeiz verlor, die wirklichen Verstrickungen des Staates beim NSU heraus zu kriegen. Da kommt nichts besser als die Beschuldigung der Pädophile. Jeder Politiker, gegen den  unter diesem Vorwurf ermittelt wird, ist weg vom Fenster. Die perfekte Diskreditierung. Nun kommt Hans-Peter Friedrich ins Spiel. Als CSU-Politiker ist er nicht gerade prädestiniert dafür, ein kritisches Bewusstsein gegenüber Überwachungsbehörden zu besitzen. Als er aber in seiner Rolle als Innenminister eine leise Ahnung über die braune Clique in den Strafverfolgungsbehörden bekam, wurde es selbst ihm zuviel. An die Öffentlichkeit zu gehen und den Verfassungsschutz als braune Institution anzuprangern, ist politisch in Deutschland und als Abgeordneter der CSU sowie international unmöglich. Da er aber so schockiert war über die Vorgänge in seiner Behörde wollte er irgendwas tun und warnte den politischen Gegner SPD , um Edathy vor der unkontrollierbaren Clique zu retten. Auch Vizekanzler Gabriel wusste, dass es politisch unmöglich ist, den Verfassungsschutz als nationalsozialistisch öffentlich zu kritisieren. Er hat so hart für die große Koalition gekämpft, dass er diese nicht aufs Spiel setzten wollte. Also warnte er lieber heimlich Edathy, was nun heraus gekommen ist, um ihn vor den braunen Beamten zu schützen.

People like to pass around the *""cake and eat it""* stuff but the reality is that the SNP/YES campaign have never said they want an independent Scotland to immediately make decisions in a vacuum. They've repeatedly acknowledged that it will take decades to become truly independent and that we will still have to have just as much (if not more) political negotiations with rUK as the process goes on.

It's never reflected reality, Salmond does indeed speak in pie-in-sky ideaology but he's not an idiot, he knows this isn't going to be won (either way) by attacking the other side because there is too much at stake, too many weaved lives, too many personal issues involved.

Senators are appointed by the Prime Minister so whenever a party is in power it stuffs the empty seats with its partisans. 
The Senate gives X number of representatives to each Province (same # for all), but in practice it just means X hack 'from' X Province.

It is not uncommon for some old partisan to run for a seat in the Commons, lose by a major percentage of the vote and then be appointed to the Senate (if the party he ran for is in power). As we normally have a system that is effectively two party, despite other parties existing, all Senators come from either the Liberals or the Conservatives.

The Senate normally shows up on Canadian news twice a decade for a major political scandal involving it, then fades back to a lesser item in the news.

There are movements to either get rid of it or make it elected, but both of those proposals require opening the Constitution (which is a nightmare in Canada, essentially meaning it would be an impossible task to change the system).

Expecting the government to enter negotiations and allow Salmond to bleat about his successes (power gain) and fleet st to moan about loss of power is unrealistic. The government knows that however hard they play it they are not losing an awful lot of political points (particularly the Tories who always do shit in Scotland). Not to mention that permitting 'pre-negotiation' is a concession before the votes have been cast. It is simply not in there political interests to allow it.

In this case of political realism the UK government is simply attempting to increase the risk of voting yes; increase the uncertainty and they might just vote no.

So far Salmond has expressed a desire to retain the pound and received a response from Westminster. If Salmond continues to express desires or state how he believes things will pan out then he can expect nothing less than Osborne or whoever shutting him down if it is in the best interests of the UK (without Scotland) to do so.

Salmonds best bet is to continue to beat the nationalist drum and try to avoid a discussion of the specifics until it has been decided at the ballot box.

As for not permitting Scotland to ask the EU  about their status: there isn't a sovereign nation in the world that would permit a part of it to go about negotiating their departure before the vote is decided. Scotland possesses neither the constitutional right nor the mandate (votes) to do so. On this point Salmond would actually be ignoring the will of his electorate in doing so.

Why not? Scotland can of course make these threats. If this is Scotland's plan, they can and should be clear about it. I'm entirely happy for Scotland to make these threats and have never said otherwise.

&gt; the UK government can make threats to not take on shared institutions.

Yes, the UK can confirm that it will not enter into a currency union, after receiving independent advice from the treasury that such a union would be unbridgeable. If one of the parties to that currency union wants different levels of taxation, different levels of spending, different levels of borrowing and has indicated that it might itself pull out of the currency union at any time and set up its own currency or join the euro, then, surprise surprise, the other party might not want to join it.

Firstly the 'hypotheekrenteaftrek' which allows you to deduct the costs of your mortgage from you taxable income. This leads to higher mortgages and inflated prices. We have to totally get rid of that. There are currently plans for slowly decreasing it, which is a start. But as we've seen in the past, this might very well be stopped.


Secondly, investment banks and savings banks should be separated again. This will make savings safer again, without the need for bailouts. Investment banks won't be able to take even bigger risks because they can't piggyback on the stability of the savings bank. They also aren't to big to fail anymore. 


The national banks supervision is currently a joke. This institute should be able to properly check what the banks are doing.

I also believe that privatisation of certain sectors wasn't that good of an idea and should be reversed. For example the train company NS and perhaps some of the privatisation in healthcare (which might be responsible for increased prices). 

These are some ideas that popped into my head. Some of them might be awful. If so I'd love to hear about why and what the better alternatives are.There is of course a lot more that is structurally wrong in this country, such as the increasing inequality and some aspects of the education system.

Private debt is mostly mortgages.

A loss of net worth while not lowering debt( house prices falling) will have ( and is having) a significant higher effect here than in Germany, which is doing well, I think everybody can agree on that atleast. 

The economy was artificially inflated by private debt in mortgages for a while and now it's somewhat deflating, and now you want to artificially inflate the economy which government debt, which when you say it like that everybody on Reddit would go ""OMG economy isn't doing great it's just the government pumping money to artificially inflate the economy"".

So yes, I do think it has some effect on the economy, but I don't think that spending is the way out of it.

I think this is the disconnect, you can't *not join* something you are already in. Or more accurately you can't opt someone else out of something.

Salmond's position is that Scotland owns part of the Bank of England on the very same basis that it owns part of the national debt, independent Scotland wouldn't be a shiny brand new entity and wouldn't have to be gifted that percentage back for a currency union to take place. Instead it would take it's ownership with it and the new status quo's specifics would be negotiated, Scotland would have to be negotiated *out*. 

I also think there is a *lot* of slightly differing culture at play in these threads with this. Scots have grew up being told they are an integral part, co-owners, of the concept of Britain and I don't get that feeling from other people, instead we seem to be viewed more as lodgers. Osborne's announcement implies he's decided that's the case, that he can just refuse us access to something that we think partially belongs to us.

However, if you happen to already have an [integrated ticket](http://www.tmb.cat/es/abonaments-integrats) purchased elsewhere, you only need a single zone to cover your trip, which represents a significant cost savings.

Multi-trip tickets only valid on the Rodalies (such as the 10-trip Bonotren) typically cost less than the equivalent multi-trip integrated ticket (the T-10), but can only be used on the Rodalies.

Why is it?  Why have I never *ever* met anyone that acts like a news website comments section person in real life?  Why are they so extremely common all over the internet?  Why do they all have exactly the same views which they feel willing to repeat for years on end?  Why do they seem to completely drown out what we would consider ""normal"" comments with their hyperbole, total lack of historical perspective, and a complex I can only describe as ""I'm making predictions that will obviously be wrong in a month and I will just ignore it when it doesn't happen.""

Their thoughts are always of imminent collapse:  The collapse of the Euro, the exit of Britain from the EU, an upcoming mass violent revolution against bankers, or immigrants, or whatever.  Year after year collapse is right around the corner.

Scotland and rUK are not currently two separate countries in a currency union, sharing equally in a resource. They are a single entity owning a resource, a resource that has value partly because it is owned by a single entity. A currency union would need to be created, a whole new legal agreement. This new currency union, between two entirely independent states is not a continuation of the status quo. It is an entirely new thing, that would require the consent of both parties and be massively negotiated.

&gt; Scots have grew up being told they are an integral part, co-owners, of the concept of Britain and I don't get that feeling from other people, instead we seem to be viewed more as lodgers.

The English have also been told that they are co-owners of the concept of Britain. But the English are not the ones who are voting for independence and not the ones trying to end the union. Imagine if things were the other way round. Imagine if the English were having a vote on independence and were saying that they did not want to be in a country with Scotland, but that the oil should continue to be a joint asset and be owned joinly by England and Scotland after independence? How would that go down in Scotland?

&gt;  Osborne's announcement implies he's decided that's the case, that he can just refuse us access to something that we think partially belongs to us.

This isn't just Osborne. This is Balls. This is Alexander. This is the Treasury. This is the first minister of Wales. This is pretty much everyone in England. We weren't the ones wanting to end the union. You wanted it. Don't be surprised that we might not want to be liable to bail out your banks after you vote for independence. We already have to bail out our own banks.

true,Orsenfelt,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt;  Imagine if the English were having a vote on independence and were saying that they did not want to be in a country with Scotland, but that the oil should continue to be a joint asset and be owned joinly by England and Scotland after independence? How would that go down in Scotland?

The United Kingdom didn't *make the oil* though, it made the infrastructure around it and it should absolutely get its fair share of that infrastructure.

All 'Union' stuff should be split. Forget the potential political and economic problems certain assets being split might cause, can we agree that everything created (good or bad) as a union should be split if the union splits?

If you take the marriage analogy, you wouldn't say that a husband could just flatly refuse the house (or the car or whatever) to the wife simply because she initiated divorce proceedings. Wanting out of the marriage does not require abandonment of all shared assets.

So if we agree on that (Which I think we do because you do think we should get our share of the debt) then it's logically consistent that we get our share of the Bank of England. *Then* comes the discussion about how we actually realistically do that without harming either country. I'm entirely open to the idea it can't be done well, I believe Osborne when he says it should not be done and that rUK will oppose it at every turn **but** saying he won't even discuss and that the decision is final betrays the idea that  this is in any way a diplomatic process for the good of the people and it denies our 'property rights'. He's essentially dismissing our part ownership of it out of hand which is a very extreme position to take against a segment of your own population who will still live in the country you run if the vote goes NO.

That's all this is, saying a currency union is a bad idea and they don't want to do it isn't an issue. Saying they've already decided, won't discuss it and we just have to live with their choice is the problem.. that's not a way a government should act towards its population.",0,1392405172,null,0,false,0,cffdxzh,t3_1xvvcx,t1_cffdxzh,t1_cffdjwm,null,1432398481,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

It's true that Lithuania &amp; Latvia have significantly higher debt levels than Estonia (40.5 &amp; 40.7 compared to 9.8, respectively), this recent growth does not have much to do that with that. 

The Estonian debt to GDP ratio has actually come close to doubling in recent years, from around 6% in 2012 and hovering around 10% at the moment. 

Meanwhile the Lithuanian &amp; Latvian government debt levels are staying about the same, in fact they have even decreased to around 39% from 40% or so a couple quarters ago.

It's definitely true that the Estonian government is more fiscally responsible when it comes to this certain metric, but it's not as though there has been a recent jump in debt that may have caused this.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; If you take the marriage analogy, you wouldn't say that a husband could just flatly refuse the house (or the car or whatever) to the wife simply because she initiated divorce proceedings. Wanting out of the marriage does not require abandonment of all shared assets.

Actually, under English law, initiating divorce proceedings changes property ownership of property fundamentally. The husband and wife automatically stop being joint tenants, they become tenants in common. Joint tenancy is co-ownership, a bit like a currency union. Tenancy in common is an equitable division of the assets.

&gt; All 'Union' stuff should be split.

Of course, all union stuff should be split. But that includes the currency union. It should be split. I don't understand how you can argue that things should be split and not expect the currency union to be split too.

&gt; So if we agree on that (Which I think we do because you do think we should get our share of the debt)

Citation needed. I think this is an open question in fact. I expect that you will, for your own good, decide to pay your share. If you decide not to, I expect we will pay it for you.

&gt; I believe Osborne when he says it should not be done and that rUK will oppose it at every turn but saying he won't even discuss and that the decision is final betrays the idea that this is in any way a diplomatic process for the good of the people and it denies our 'property rights'. He's essentially dismissing our part ownership of it out of hand which is a very extreme position to take against a segment of your own population who will still live in the country you run if the vote goes NO.

As mentioned several times, this is not just Osborne's own personal intervention. This is the Treasury. This is Balls. This is Alexander. This is everyone in England. We're not saying you don't currently own the pound. The UK owns the pound. But if you don't want want to be in the UK, it is hardly extreme to say that you won't be in a currency union with the UK. After all the problems of the eurozone, to say anything else would be slightly irresponsible. 

&gt; we just have to live with their choice is the problem..

You are voting, not me. You make the choice. We're just telling you what that choice means.

true,Orsenfelt,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt; Scotland and rUK are not currently two separate countries in a currency union, sharing equally in a resource.

-- You, about 30 minutes ago.

&gt; Of course, all union stuff should be split. But that includes the currency union. It should be split. I don't understand how you can argue that things should be split and not expect the currency union to be split too.

-- You, just now

So which is it? The issue isn't about any current currency union, it's about inherited ownership of (a percentage of) the Bank of England. If Scotland has moral ownership of a percentage of this nations national debt then it also has moral ownership in the same ratio of all this nations assets.

One of those assets is the Bank of England and our ongoing ownership of it after independence puts us in a defacto currency union *unless we negotiate a different outcome*. The SNP openly stated that a currency union was their goal but that negotiations would have to take place. rUK is perfectly entitled to reject any offer put forward but it is *not* (or should not be) entitled to simply assume our owned percentage.

Which is *exactly* the point Salmond is making, rUK shouldn't be picking and choosing, if we have no moral ownership of the BoE then we have no moral ownership of the debt and you can pay it. It's not an *actual threat* to not take the debt it's pointing out that it's not solely up to rUK which pies we get slices of. If it's a union and we're all in it together we get the same slice of all pies *then* we talk about how those slices get delivered or if we'll pass on some to get more of others, we reach an agreement, that's how democratic negotiations work.

&gt; As mentioned several times, this is not just Osborne's own personal intervention. This is the Treasury. This is Balls. This is Alexander. This is everyone in England. We're not saying you don't currently own the pound. The UK owns the pound. But if you don't want want to be in the UK, it is hardly extreme to say that you won't be in a currency union with the UK. After all the problems of the eurozone, to say anything else would be slightly irresponsible.

I'm aware but since he did the talking and since I can't be arsed to type out a list of all the involved parties each and everytime I'll stick to just using his name as shorthand.

Yes the UK owns the pound but the UK is owned by the people and some of those people are Scottish. If you quit a job the wages you earned are still yours, they don't revert to the company with a ""*Well if you wanted them you shouldn't have quit*"" note attached. Everyone elses wages aren't yours and you aren't entitled to more but the company can't just decide to not give them to you because it wouldn't be good for the company or remaining employees.

&gt; You are voting, not me. You make the choice. We're just telling you what that choice means.

Are you not in the least bit disappointed that your own government is telling it's own citizens that if they don't vote *with* the government then said government will flatly reject attempts to come to an agreement on an issue? 

What if this was nothing to do with independence and the government said ""*Yeah you could vote Labour in the next general election but if we happen to win it we'll never listen to a registered lefty every again*"".

&gt;  While freedom of information is occasionally abused in some European Union countries, it is repeatedly and blatantly flouted in others. This is the case in Greece, which has plunged more than 50 places in the press freedom index in the space of just five years. This is a dizzying fall for the world’s oldest democracy.

&gt; The 2007 economic crisis hit the Greek media hard. The few wealthy shipowners and entrepreneurs who financed the national media have moved their investments into more profitable sectors. One news organization after another has announced layoffs. Many journalists are now unemployed. As well as economic difficulties, the Greek media have a bad reputation that is the result of years of clientelism. Reporters covering the frequent street protests against the austerity measures adopted by a series of short-lived governments have been the victims of both police violence and violence by demonstrators accusing them of colluding with the government. The security situation has been aggravated by the rise of the neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn, which won nearly 20 seats in the Voulí (parliament) in June 2012 thanks to euroscepticism and growing hostility towards foreigners accused of “stealing Greece.” Golden Dawn’s leaders and supporters openly target journalists. Physical attacks have become systematic throughout the country. Death threats are growing.

&gt; June 2013 was a turning point in Greece’s media history. In a race to cut spending, conservative Prime Minister Antonis Samaras took what was an unprecedented decision in a European Union country. Under pressure from the troika (the European Commission, European Central Bank and IMF) to reduce the budget deficit, Samaras closed the state-owned national broadcaster, ERT, consisting of four TV stations and five radio stations. Just hours after ERT was told of the decision, dark screens with the words “No signal” stunned Europe and the world. Under international pressure, the government finally announced the creation of a new state broadcaster to be called NERIT.

Firstly I wasn't suggesting inflation of the economy when raising government debt. I was criticizing some of the budget cuts, like getting rid of the subsidized jobs for handicapped people. 

Besides that, increased government spending doesn't necessarily lead to artificial inflation of the economy. When the money is invested in structural improvements like better infrastructure and better education, then the money isn't wasted. This is the reason governments always have a bit of a deficit. They expect to be making a profit out of the loaned money.

-Mountains: virtually none - you don't hear alpine skiers coming to Hungary for training

-Women: gorgeous

-Politics: Classic post-communist European situation. Half the people have no idea what's going on. The other half are dissatisfied with virtually all of the parties the country has to offer.

-Nightlife: Budapest definitely has one of the best nightlife scenes on the continent. This is helped by the fact that the busiest tram and bus lines run all night, so nobody's discouraged from staying out too late. In the countryside, it's the usual: one or two pubs per village, open til 9-10.

-Public safety: the eastern third of the country has more crime rates than the central/western regions (many villages in the east are populated by Gypsies; I'm not trying to sound racist, it's merely statistics). Budapest is safer than your average European city, though it obviously has shady spots.

-Balaton: Our ""sea"". Bigass lake with non-stop parties in the cities on the southern side (Siofok being the most popular). Mixed with family-friendly villages.

If Scotland has moral ownership of a percentage of this nations national debt then it also has moral ownership in the same ratio of all this nations assets.

&gt; One of those assets is the Bank of England and our ongoing ownership of it after independence puts us in a defacto currency union unless we negotiate a different outcome. The SNP openly stated that a currency union was their goal but that negotiations would have to take place. rUK is perfectly entitled to reject any offer put forward but it is not (or should not be) entitled to simply assume our owned percentage.

It's just about the ownership of the Bank of England is it? Tell you what. You can have 100 per cent of the Bank of England. All of it. Every single bit. You can have the entire asset. You don't just get your percentage. You get our percentage too.

rUK taxpayer (don't worry, we're not asking iScotland to pay for this) then pays for a new asset called Bank of rUK, prints a new currency, called rUK pound for which Bank of rUK has monetary policy, passes legislation saying that rUK pound is legal tender in rUK, passes legislation that all existing debts denominated in GBP will be redenominated in rUK pounds rather than GBP at the time of independence and confirms to the markets that it will repay the entire share of the existing debt issued by the UK.

Happy now? That asset that you want so much? You get to keep it.  We don't slice that bit of the pie. You can have the whole thing. No threats! It's yours. All of it. We're not picking and choosing. You have the whole thing to do exactly what you want with. That liability that we share? You don't have to repay it, we will repay all of it.

&gt; Are you not in the least bit disappointed that your own government is telling it's own citizens that if they don't vote with the government then said government will flatly reject attempts to come to an agreement on an issue? 

This isn't a regular vote. After independence they won't be your government any more. You won't be their citizens. That's what independence means.

&gt; What if this was nothing to do with independence and the government said ""Yeah you could vote Labour in the next general election but if we happen to win it we'll never listen to a registered lefty every again"".

Well can you give me other reasons? That's why I asked.

&gt;You do realise that selective and mutation breeding was the current way of increasing production and quality?

And? I thought you don't disagree with me that we already produce far more food than the EU needs. What's the need for faster breeding, besides more profits?

And the article is right that labeling can make consumers avoid GMO foods, but so what? Customers should be free to avoid any product for any damn reason? I know people who buy wine based on what label art looks the best. Should we make that illegal? Should we force all wine labels to be identical, so people don't make irrational purchasing decision like that?

- Politics: 10 different parties in the parliament (anti-Europe, liberal, socialist, christian, environmental, ...) Government is a mixture of the liberal party and labour party.
- People: Dutch people may appear blunt because they will tell you what their opinion is, it does not matter what the topic is, we all have an opinion. This results in the large number of parties. Oh and we like to complain about practically everything.
- Colour: The Royal House is named ""Van Oranje"" (Of Orange) and we have therefore adopted orange as our national colour.

As she retired last year, we will be celebrating ""Koningsdag"" (King's Day) on April 27 this year, a celebration of King Willem-Alexanders birthday. A lot of orange is to be seen then.

The body that signs the forms is the one responsible.
It's not a decision for English (I suppose you mean British or do you sign for the idea that Scotland is a colony?) law alone, as the forms are written (and signed) between UK and other nations. What you are actually doing is negotiating with the the debt holders for who handles debt. Sure, you can write that ""8% of United Kingdom debt is from now paid by Scotland"" but Finland could legislate that as well.
Perhaps the banks would then go to Scottish government and ask are you really paying this, and they may then say ""LOL NO"" and that's that then.

Perhaps you could tell me - did Irish Free State take part of UK debt when THEY left?

I don't mean British law, I mean English law. In case you didn't know, England and Scotland have separate legal systems. When it comes to debt, there is no such thing as British law. All of the debt issued by the UK is governed by English law and the courts of England have jurisdiction to decide disputes about it. Perhaps you are not a lawyer? As a matter of English law, the person required to repay Uk debt is the person that the UK legislation says is required to pay them.

Of course if Scotland refuses to repay its share, then England will likely pay it instead. But this will not harm England's credit rating. It will harm Scotland's. If Scotland wants a good credit rating, it will pay its share.",0,1392411662,null,0,false,0,cffgwv6,t3_1xvvcx,t1_cffgwv6,t1_cffg9gi,null,1432399880,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

In the face of the problems with the euro and Scotland's heinous non compliance with the fiscal requirements of the euro, the obvious route to go would have been a separate, new Scottish currency, freely traded on the international markets.

This would have entailed costs but it could have been viable if Salmon and his Nationalists had dared to have confidence in it but as is typical of the cowardice of any narrow, parochial, cocooned nomenklatura, they didn't.

And so, no one can expect any money market decision makers to have any confidence in the Scotch Groat, Buckfast, call it what you will, if the Scots themselves don't.

Not good.

They say they could peg it to the pound sterling.  

But you need to have something to peg it with?

You need foreign currency reserves to peg one currency to another and by the time Scotland has paid for its Glasgow neds and Edinburgh junkies there isn't enough money left.

When the money markets start to sell the Scottish buck, Salmon would need something to buy it back with to maintain the peg but you can't get a price on old mother Hubbard's cupboard.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Death of Marat is a great, great painting, it has fascinated me since HS. It seems so modern, particularly in it's ability to capture a moment in time, it is almost like the ultimate tabloid. Revolutionary France was a terrifying place. People were getting killed left and right. It was a carnival; one day you are King, the next you are Beggar (or worse). Up is down, and down is up, yet somehow Marat seemed to be a man making sense of it all and even having a vision and some control, within this chaotic void of a moment in history. Then he is killed, consumed by the flames he seemed to manage. Too close to the firestorm. 

The horrific inexplicability of events is finally evident in the Image. Words, spoken or on the page are meaningless (as the penned list of potential enemies he is holding tragically, ironically indicates). The harsh reality of Revolutionary fervor becomes crystallized in the stillness of the image. It is a reminder that Revolution is an act of imagination, of fantasy, and that true fantasies realized are always nightmares. It reminds us we must have a relationship to the Real, to the grotesque consequences of our revolutionary dreams. Dreams have consequences. We cannot let our drive get caught up and lost in fantasy. It becomes clear France was caught up in the game of desires and dreams, where primordial drive reigns over reason.

It seems to me as if the confused horror show that was Revolutionary France looms in the dark upper half of the painting. And the quiet, still dead body of a man who was so caught up in the Revolution, sits perfectly balanced below. The Real is finally accounted for in the finality of this balance. It is a very clear event, in the philosophical sense. Something has happened which, because its subjects relationship to our symbolic constellation is a certain way, seems to speak for more than just itself. A moment in time imbued with meaning.

Threaten stability? If stability is the path the UK is travelling just now then it's quite apparent that Scotland in *or* out of the union can do sod all about it. Our votes haven't mattered a jot in general elections since the 60's, *we* aren't the ones voting for Tories or UKIP but they are increasingly in positions of power where they inevitably try and enact their corporate-backhander or racist little-englander policies.

Nuclear weapons, taxation, wars, education, health, energy.. we differ. Not as much as the UK and France might differ but it's enough to make living together quite difficult despite the large amounts of separation that already exist.

&gt; It's ugly and it's childish, and I don't like it. I think after a few hundred years of being so fractured, we should grow the hell up and accept ourselves as being a Nation.

Of course you'd like that because *you* wouldn't have to change. It'd be awesome if everyone just became like me, we'd all get along and there wouldn't be any more strife! Well sorry but I'm not about to just wholesale adopt *your* national identity to make your life easier.

I'm Scottish, I'm proud to be Scottish. I'm not *bothered* by the fact I'm British too but because it's so incredibly dominated by English culture I choose to distance myself from it, tend to gravitate toward something I can identify with. I *like* bagpipes we aren't all just bearing it because we hate you.

Why don't you just become Scottish, we'll go independent and you can get yourself a patriotic Irn Bru addiction? No? You want to stay British? How childish, I don't like it.

It's not just us btw, large parts of the north of England are disenfranchised too and I'd love to take them with us but there simply isn't the unifying identity or the recent devolved history to do it.

Another good bet is another of the so-called ""Skagen painters"" (of the northernmost tip of Jutland), Michael Anker: [Vil han klare pynten?](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Vil_han_klare_pynten.jpg) meaning ""Will he round the point?""

Another painting that is famous in Denmark is H.A. Brendekilde's [Udslidt](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DW_dyBBaOTQ/TcvzKfbd0yI/AAAAAAAAIeA/2XnQ9f684sY/s1600/h-a-brendekilde-udslidt.jpg) meaning ""Worn out"". It's a powerful painting, probably my favourite as well.

*This richly coloured watercolour painting depicts the ill-fated lovers Hellelil and Hildebrand, meeting on the stone stairway of a medieval tower. The princess and her bodyguard had fallen in love but her father regarded the young soldier as an unsuitable match for his daughter and ordered his sons to kill him. The painting captures the couple’s poignant final embrace. Burton was inspired by the story of the ill-fated lovers told in an old Danish ballad.*

Though I suppose Ireland's most famous artist is probably Francis Bacon.

true,DV1312,null,null,"Was für ein Verschwörungsschwachsinn. Friedrich informierte die SPD-Spitze im Oktober letzten Jahres. Zu einem Zeitpunkt also, wo SPD und die Union bereits in Koalitionsverhandlungen waren und im Grunde feststand, dass sie die neue Regierung bilden. 

Die logischste Erklärung für etwas, ist immer diejenige, die am einfachsten von A nach B führt. Friedrich sieht, dass Edathy ein neuer Star der SPD ist, weiß aber gleichzeitig, dass er mit Kinderpornos zu tun hat. Selbst wenn er sich nicht strafbar gemacht hat, wäre das ein Riesenskandal für die neue Koalition, also steckt er es den Genossen.

Jetzt ein wenig Spekulation... Monate später wird das Kabinett vorgestellt. Verwundert reiben sich einige die Augen. Heiko Maas als Justizminister? Dabei sollte das doch mal Edathys Platz am Koalitionstisch werden.

Wen kümmert es, dass Heiko Maas mehr Probleme mit der Vorratsdatenspeicherung hat als Edathy? Immerhin wird bei ihm nicht zwangsläufig alles in die Luft fliegen! Ein Kinderporno- Justizminister wäre das schlimmste an Skandal in der Ära Merkel - wo es ja nicht gerade wenige Skandale gegeben hat.

Das alles noch viel besser zusammengefasst hat Kai Uwe Steffens bei telepolis: http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/41/41002/1.html

Das ist immer noch eine Verschwörung, aber weniger Verschwörungstheorie. Und um den Fakt, dass er tatsächlich in Kontakt mit Kinderpornografie war, kommt man da leider nicht herum - warum würde man das überhaupt erfinden, nur um sofort auf Ermittlungsergebnisse aus Kanada zu verweisen, über die man keinerlei Kontrolle hat? 

Und außerdem, das ist am wichtigsten von allem und die größte Lücke in deiner Verschwörungstheorie, wurden diese Ermittlungsergebnisse in Kanada schon erzielt, als Mundlos und Böhnhardt noch lange nicht verkohlt mit Schusswunden im Kopf in einem Wohnmobil gefunden wurden. Geschweige denn, dass Edathy den NSU Ausschuss leitete.

Also, sechs, setzen, zurück ans drawing board. Da macht ja die WTC7 Theorie mehr Sinn!

Edit: Wie andere hier schon festgestellt haben - richtig verschwörungstheoretisch wird es an der Stelle, wo wir hier mal ernsthaft Fragen, an welchem Punkt Merkel über Edathy informiert wurde und ob sie Friedrich das Go Ahead gab, die Informationen an die SPD weiterzugeben.
