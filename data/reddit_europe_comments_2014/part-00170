Sorry, i have to answer to that. Yes, that was the first major deployment of German military after WWII (before they were nearly only active at natural disasters like floods). And yes, what the Schröder gouvernment did was a break of traditions. And this is highly debatable. But i probably would do the same if i were in that position. 

The Bundeswehr went to this conflict together with the NATO to stop an ongoing genocide after many attempts through political solutions. It started around 1992 and Milosevic didn't stop. The main argument for the Greens was ""never Auschwitz again"". And hunted people don't know borders. It was still a massacre, which would have continued without a intervention.

I don't say the Bundeswehr should be free to operate everywhere they want. But this was kind of a emergency case. For Afghanistan, it was the first and only ""Casus Foederis"", so we had to operate there.

And why this lack of knowledge? The Moroccan Wars were, together with the Civil War, the most important event in XX century Spanish history. More Spanish soldiers died in combat in the Battle of Annual alone than in the entire Spanish-American War. And the Civil War itself was, to a great extent, sparked by the conflict in Morocco: from the social tensions caused by the draft and how the better-off could buy their release from the Army, to the birth of an entire generation of ambitious officers utterly devoid of any humanitarian scruples, like Millán-Astray and Franco himself, through the discredit on the monarchy caused by the meddling of Alfonso XIII in the military and his direct personal responsibility in the defeat in Annual, almost everything in the colonial wars contributed to the destructive fanaticism of the Civil War.

C) Select a spot some days prior to the run, and one that is easy to run because you are a beginner. 

D) Expect to be pushed away by other runners. Expect the floor to be messy and slippery.

E) The bulls run damn fast, much faster than a person. If you fall to the floor in front of them stay crouched in fetal position with your hands protecting your head and the back of your neck, don't look up, wait until they have passed.

I received the FAZ for free for a year as part of their cooperation with some website for students. They usually are conservative with their selection of news-worthy topics/incidents but the writing style actually is neutral, especially compared to ""Die Welt"" and ""Focus"".

While public broadcasters like the BBC seem to be liked in this thread, I can't say the same about ARD and ZDF. I tend to ignore them because their coverage often is not in-depth and doesn't have anything that's not offered by Spiegel Online.

true,NewBacon-ings,UNSA,United States of America,"I don't know if I would claim these sources are excessively neutral, but here are some from the US. I've market the sources that have limits to the number of articles you can read with a 'P.'

[Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/) - I like it a lot. *Not from the US, but has a large reporting base in the US.* Usually the first place I go for US news. Immaculately neutral isn't how would describe it. But for a free news source I think it's pretty good, I rarely feel like they are 'selling' a political ideology, in respect to US politics.

[Politico](http://www.politico.com/) -P- For US politics this is my favorite site. They really go a lot deeper into issues than nearly anywhere else, and I think make a pretty good pitch at trying to show the light and dark of both sides. 

[The Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/europe) -P- My dad always read this when I was a kid, so maybe I'm predisposed to liking it. I would say the reporters there are more 'center-right,' and the editorials can get a bit wonky, but I generally consider them to have pretty high journalistic standards. If they report something they usually have the facts straight. I also like they're pencil sketchings =D

[The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/) -P- I'm not in love with the New York Times, especially the cite. My campus had free copies available and I would read it about every day. It's good, the print version is better. They have a free mobile app that's pretty good too (and free!).

[Five Thirty Eight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) An offshoot of the New York Times. It's more numbers and stats based, and doesn't really 'report' on things so much as crunch data. Come here during the US elections if you want real reporting and not masturbatory articles with click-bate headlines. Seriously, come here during the US elections.  I'm quite fond of the guy that runs it, Nate Silver, but I have sort of a thing for statistics. 

I also really like Reddit. I wouldn't call it neutral, but I think (especially the local subreddits) have a lot of untapped potential for in depth issue exploration and finding articles. Participating in local subreddits during current events is a great way to expand your coverage on local stories and find articles in different languages from local news sources. You have to do a bit of work going through Google Translate, and then more work verifying claims and trying to sort through potential bias, but if you're willing to do the legwork there is really no other place I know of that can give you what it gives.

_edit:_ These are mostly for domestic news, most US sources aren't spectacular with international stuff, both in quality and in incidence. I wouldn't say stay away, but... diversify? They probably wouldn't meet your standards of neutral either...

Also, as a rule of thumb, if a US source is also a 24 hour cable news network, maybe just google whatever you are looking up. CNN is sadly a sinking ship of quality news. I've been out of the states for a while, so maybe things have changed. People often complain about  CNN (FOXnews, ect.) both to me when I'm abroad and online. It mostly deserves the flak it gets (especially Fox *cough* *cough* *cough*), it's not terrible, but it's not great either. Like Mcdonalds, I always get a little frustrated when people complain about it. Of course its terrible, but most of our parents love us and give us vegetables. Though sadly, it is consumed in disgustingly high amounts by certain people. 

More to your point on neutrality, I used to really be into it, and I think its important to know the subjective perspective of whatever author is writing something. Even without manipulating or misrepresenting facts, selectively leaving out information can lead to potential biased reporting, even if it is unintentional. I try to have a core group of sites that I rely on for quick information, but I only assume it has a higher chance of being more 'objective,' since outright report manipulation would harm the reputation they are trying to maintain. In the long run, there is really no substitute for going through large numbers of news sources from a diverse set of subjective biases, and then going through and trying to verify that information with other sources and reports. I try to maintain an approach of 'trust but verify,' trusting some sources more, and taking time to verify claims on others that I trust less. 

I'll stop my rant and get back to work. Good luck on your search, I'll definitely be checking whats written here, nice post OP! =)

&gt;

&gt;The __1984 European Cup Final__ was an [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) match between [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) of England and [Roma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma) of Italy on 30 May 1984 at the [Stadio Olimpico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadio_Olimpico), Rome, Italy. It was the final match of the [1983–84 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983%E2%80%9384_European_Cup) of Europe's premier cup competition, the [European Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League). Liverpool were appearing in their fourth final, having won the competition in [1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_European_Cup_Final), [1978](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_European_Cup_Final) and [1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_European_Cup_Final). Roma were appearing in their first European Cup final.

&gt;Each club needed to progress through four rounds to reach the final. Matches were contested over two legs, with a match at each team's home ground. Liverpool's matches ties ranged from close affairs to comfortable victories. They beat [Athletic Bilbao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_Bilbao) by a single goal in the second round, while they beat [Benfica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica) 5–1 on aggregate in the quarter-finals. Roma's matches were all close affairs, winning their ties up to the semi-final by two goal margins. They beat [Dundee United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundee_United_F.C.) 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-finals, although it was later revealed that Roma attempted to bribe the referee in the second leg of the semi-final.

&gt;As the final was held at Roma's home ground they went into the match as favourites, despite Liverpool's previous record in the competition. Watched by a crowd of 69,693, Liverpool took the lead in the first half when [Phil Neal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Neal) scored, but Roma equalised before half-time through [Roberto Pruzzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Pruzzo). With the scores level at 1–1 through full-time and [extra-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports\)), the match went to a [penalty shoot-out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football\)). Liverpool won the shoot-out 4–2 to claim their fourth European Cup.

&gt; ""mit der Hand oder technischen Hilfsmitteln geschriebene ___Zeichen___  auf Papier oder einem anderen Untergrund als Schriftträger (Brief, Nachricht)"". 

Da du den Satz scheinbar nicht verstehst, versuche ich ihn noch etwas simpler zu formulieren: 

Das Kommunikationsmittel ist das Zeichen (mit der Hand o. techn. Hilfsmitteln geschrieben) und der Schriftträger das Papier oder anderer Untergrund. Ein handschriftlich verfasstes Zeichen ist nichts anderes als das, was wir hier allgemein als Handschrift verfassen. War das jetzt so schwer herzuleiten?

Nun erklär mir bitte genau, was ich daran falsch zitiert oder verstanden habe? Wirst ja wohl nicht ohne Grund irgendwelche falschen Behauptungen aufstellen, oder doch?


Wenn du zwischen Medium und Kommunikationsmittel nicht unterscheiden kannst, tut es mir Leid für dich, jedoch solltest du dich an solchen Diskussionen künftig nicht mit einer derartigen Selbstgefälligkeit beteiligen, um irgendwelche falsche Behauptungen durchzudrücken.

&gt;Und dieses Mehr an Information geht unwiederbringlich verloren, wenn standardisierte Zeichen verwendet werden

Blödsinn. Hier ein kurzer Ausschnits eines Gedichtes von einem dir bekannten Dichter (Goethe):

Ach, was soll der Mensch verlangen?

Ist es besser, ruhig bleiben?

Klammernd fest sich anzuhangen?

Ist es besser, sich zu treiben?

Ob ich das nun in Times New Roman lese oder handschriftlich in superschöner Schreibschrift - sagt der Text dadurch etwas anderes aus? Nein. Soll der Inhalt des Gedichts durch die Art des Schreibstils beeinflusst werden? Nein. Genauso verhält es sich bei den meisten anderen Textformen, ob es nun ein Eintrag im Lexikon ist, ein Aufsatz in der Schule, oder oder.
Dass beispielsweise ein Liebesbrief anders auf einen wirkt, wenn dieser handschriftlich verfasst ist, ist unbestritten, jedoch tut dieser das immer noch, wenn die Benotung der Handschrift wegfällt. Es geht in dem Fall nicht um die Schönheit (die subjektiv ist) des Schriftsatzes, sondern um die persönliche Note, die dieser dadruch erhält.


Du redest die ganze Zeit von standardisierten Zeichen, frage mich jedoch, wo du das plötzlich hernimmst? Die Abschaffung der gesonderten Benotung der Handschrift bedeutet doch nicht, dass Kinder anfangen standardisiert zu schreiben. Ganz im Gegenteil, durch die Benotung der Handschrift forciert man diese doch eher einen bestimmten Schreibstil anzustreben, um eben gut benotet zu werden. Entsprechend müssten doch wichtige ""Metainformationen"" (um deine Begriffe zu verwenden) verloren gehen, die das Alleinstellungsmerkmal, persönliche Entwicklung und das ganze null-aussagende und pseudointellektuell-klingende Blabla, welches du noch aufgezählt hast, beeinflussen.

&gt;Handschrift ist deshalb Bildung, weil sie hilft, eine eigene Persönlichkeit herauszubilden und darzustellen. Sie ist ein Merkmal, durch das sich das Individuum von der Masse abhebt.

ein Grundschüler, der eine in den Augen des Lehrers schreckliche Schrift hat und von diesem mit einer 5 benotet wird, entwickelt auch seine eigene Persönlichkeit und hebt sich dadurch von der Masse ab, nur wird diese Person mti einer schlechten Note quitiert, weil seine Handschrift von irgendeiner ästhetischen Norm abweicht. Ist das der Sinn der Benotung? Reine Ästhetik?

&gt; Soweit ich weiß, wird der Umgang mit Worten und die Wortwahl bereits benotet - bei mir war das der Deutsch- und Literaturunterricht.

richtig. nur hast du scheinbar wieder nicht gelesen, was ich geschrieben habe. Um mich wieder selbst zu zitieren: ""Und wieso gibt es keine **gesonderte Benotung** für Eloquenz?""

Wenn ich gesondert schreibe, meine ich in der Regel auch gesondert. *Keine gesonderte Benotung* impliziert in diesem Kontext, dass eine Benotung vorliegt, nur eben nicht gesondert - um das Wort gesondert zum fünften Mal hintereinander zu benutzen. 
Aus dieser Implikation entstand ja auch mein Vorschlag - um mich erneut zu zitieren: ""Ließe sich das nicht mit dem Fach ""Bildende Kunst"" kombinieren?"". Warum soll also Handschrift eine eigene Note auf dem Zeugnis stehen haben, die Eloquenz jedoch nicht, wenn es deiner Meinung nach doch so ähnlich ist?


&gt;sie kann Auskunft geben über den Bildungsgrad des Schreibers, über die Sorgfalt oder die Muse beim Schreiben, über das Geschlecht, das Alter usw.

Das ist nicht richtig. Ein ungebildeter Mensch kann eine wunderschöne Schrift haben, der Professor in Mathematik hingegen eine nicht so schöne. Wie lässt sich da von einem Zusammenhang ausgehen? Und nein, dies ist sicherlich kein Ausnahmebeispiel, was du als (ich nehme an) studierter Informatiker sicherlich untersterichen kannst, da gerade in dem Fachbereich auch nciht viel Wert auf Handschrift gelegt wird! Oder willst du mir sagen, dass du anhand des Schriftbildes erkennst, ob jemand gebildet ist oder nicht? Kannst dich ja mal für eine Wette bei Wetten, dass anbieten...

Gerade der Inhalt sagt über die von dir genannten Punkte viel mehr aus. Wie bilde ich meine Sätze, welche Wörter benutze ich, ist meine Punktuation und Grammatik korrekt? Du kannst eine noch so schöne Schrift haben, den Inhalt wirst du damit nie ausglecihen können.

Das war es von meiner Seite zu diesem Thema, wenn du weiterhin der Meinung bist, irgendwelche aus dem Zusammenhang gerissene, schön klingende Begrifflichkeiten reinwerfen zu müssen, um blödsinnigen Argumenten Ausdruck zu verleihen, tu das weiterhin, ich werde da jedoch nicht drauf reagieren. Scheinbar gehörst du auch zu der Gattung Mensch, die es versucht inhaltsleere Texte in schöne Worthülsen zu packen - was nicht unbedingt für dich spricht.

On voit le résultat en [Grande-Bretagne](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatisation_de_British_Rail#Effets_de_la_privatisation) Toutes les justifications avancées pour la privatisation sont loin d'avoir été réalisé. En France aussi on a ""privatisé en partie"", avec par exemple France Telecom et EDF.

true,jeanralph,ZBSVUE,U-E,"Post intéressant (tout comme la vidéo), mais qui me laisse avec certains doutes et interrogations. Ca soulève de bonnes questions même si j'aurais tendance à penser que le libéralisme actuel y trouve déjà des réponses.

&gt; On est tous bercé à la religion du progrès et de la fuite en avant, l'idée que l'histoire à un sens, que le passé c'était pire et que l'avenir sera forcément mieux, on ne se pose pas la question de savoir si c'est ou profitable pour le plus grand nombre la société de demain

Je ne suis pas certain que ça soit la définition (même élargie à sa dimension ""culturelle"") la plus caractéristique du libéralisme. L'histoire qui aurait mécaniquement un sens et les lendemains qui chanteront en partie grâce au progrès, ça me rappelle certains pans du marxisme.

&gt; L'état étant axiologiquement neutre, respectant ""la morale personnelle"" des uns et des autres, ne reconnaissant que le statut de consommateur des uns et des autres c'est au final c'est le marché qui servira de régulateur.

Si l'état est neutre et consacré à la défense d'une société portée vers une logique de droits individuels (la ""morale personnelle"" dont tu parles), est-ce que ça n'est plus exact de conclure que l'état ne reconnaît que l'individu et ses singularités (plutôt que le citoyen ou que le consommateur) ?

Je comprends la logique selon laquelle la somme des volontés individuelles peut donner lieu au consumérisme même si je pense que c'est très très très loin d'être absolu (sans compter que gagner une coupe du monde ou se prendre un 11 septembre sur le coin du museau unit les citoyens d'un même pays probablement au moins aussi bien que le consumérisme ne le fait), mais du point de vue de l'état plus précisément ça ne me paraît pas évident de dire que celui-ci ne reconnaît que le consommateur.

&gt; Les rapports humains en dehors de l'argent n'étant régit que par la concurrence violente et l'opposition ""passive"" de tous contre tous, au final le libéralisme reproduit les phénomènes contre lesquels il avait été précisément créé, la coexistence impossible des hommes entre eux.

Peut-on montrer que c'est ce qui arrive quand on va au delà de la réflexion théorique pour aller regarder les chiffres ? Il doit y'avoir des indicateurs objectifs qui iraient dans le sens de sociétés occidentales plus fragmentées dont certains segments sont en conflit ouvert avec d'autres, mais ceux auxquels je pense (taux de criminalité notamment) ne me paraissent pas aller dans ce sens. Le taux d'homicide de nos sociétés post industrielles est une fraction de ce qu'il était pendant le siècle des Lumières, lui même étant une fraction de ce qu'on pouvait trouver dans les sociétés médiévales et ainsi de suite jusqu'aux tribus de chasseurs cueilleurs. La multiplication spectaculaire des conflits (interpersonels, régionaux ou internationaux) n'est pas à l'ordre du jour.

Better-written than other newspapers, more international news, more objective coverage of pretty much everything imo. Which isn't hard because the other newspapers really suck. The website has a nice fact-checking section and lots of interesting (for some of them) blogs. It's far from perfect but it's one of the best newspapers I know of.

* [Arte](http://www.arte.tv) : French-German public channel. Their evening news segment is by far the best in France, with much more international news and much less sensationalism than other channels. Few people watch it for that reason, and also because it also dwells a lot on German politics, which nobody cares about. Apart from news, they have a ""cultural"" schedule, it's sometimes boring but I'm glad that it exists.

Tu ne peux pas te loger, tu déplacer, bouffer, t'éduquer, te soigner etc. Tout ça passe bien évidemment avant la ""liberté"" de s'assurer contre le chômage et pour la retraite...

&gt; J'habite en Australie, un des pays les plus libéraux du monde. Les ""pauvres"" (= classe moyenne française) ont plus de liberté qu'en France, vu qu'ils ont la liberté en matière de retraite.

Justement l'Australie est un des pays [les plus inégalitaires de l'OCDE](http://www.inegalites.fr/spip.php?article990) et les plus pollueurs.

&gt;les ouvriers au SMIC sont forcés de cotiser au régime général, et donc de renflouer les régimes spéciaux de gens qui gagnent le triple (cheminots) ou qui travaillent deux fois moins (intermittents du travail)

Et vice versa. Les ouvriers sont largement gagnants quand tu comptes la santé, l'éducation, le transport, le logement etc.

&gt;Bref, pas très égalitaire. 

Au contraire... C'est bien plus égalitaire que le système australien qui est individualiste.

Mais de toute façon l'Australie est un pays peu peuplé, d'occupation récente et où il y a pénurie de main d'oeuvre. Rien à voir avec la France. Appliquer des schémas salariaux de pays de colons à des pays d'histoire ne sert à rien.

&gt;Et comme les retraites sont versées au compte goutte (tous les mois), ils profitent moins de leur retraite puisque le type qui s'est cassé la santé dans une fonderie ou au fond d'une mine a une espérance de vie beaucoup plus courte qu'un fonctionnaire ou un cadre qui a passé sa carrière dans un bureau.

FTFY! :p

Explanation: The monarchy does not raise money and is a huge expense. Visit Britain (the UK tourism agency) make no special consideration of them. The top monarchy related site in the UK is Windsor Castle at a mere 17th place on the top UK tourist attraction, ten places behind Legoland Windsor.

As mothers ran out of milk for their children, protesting migrants blocked the highway with upturned rubbish bins and Lucano threatened to go on hunger strike.

&gt;Locals admit that goodwill towards migrants is partly linked to the government funding they bring – €25 to €30 per migrant per day – and the social service jobs they generate. ""Many people here are unemployed, so this means work for us too,"" said Monica Audino, who works for an agency helping new arrivals file asylum claims and find accommodation.

No, non sono affatto mad perché so di avere ragione e, una volta esposte le mie motivazioni, ora non devo provare più niente a nessuno.

Quello precedente, più elaborato e più in topic, è sempre diretto agli altri, non volevo che la gente si facesse idee distorte, e non era rivolto a te in particolare, dato che non c'è sordo peggiore di chi non vuol sentire.

Ora chiunque legga il dibattito può farsi un'idea di chi parla con cognizione di causa e di chi invece ne fa una questione personale e vuole avere per forza ragione.

Se il mio interlocutore parte da questi presupposti, posso stare fino all'infinito e oltre a fornire dati e spiegazioni metodologiche, che non sarebbero accettati. Un esempio:

&gt;Forse perché l'idea che non puoi infilare dentro una nuova categoria dei vecchi concetti mi sembra assurda.

A me sembra assurdo dire far rientrare nella stessa categoria cristianocentrica, che il cristianesimo ha usato per definire se stesso, fenomeni culturali diversi.

Però se per te è lo stesso, le nostre posizioni sono inconciliabili e la cosa può finire qua, per quanto mi riguarda.

Però ripeto, secondo me è fatica sprecata entrare ancora nel merito perché la questione è a monte: sembra che tu voglia fare delle gare o provare chissà che cosa, e io non ci voglio avere a che fare.

Pas que les constats soient complètement mauvais, mais la défiance affichée et ruminée de ces vieux fossiles n'offre rien. Il me semble qu'ils réagissent à la chute brutale d'un système comme s'il s'agissait d'une attaque contre leur propre personne, leurs valeurs qui n'ont plus cours et leur propre expérience. Ce sont des ""philosophes"", des ""littéraires"" qui expriment le rejet de la technique et de ce qu'ils ne comprennent pas comme les luddites du temps des premiers métiers à tisser. 

Mais ce qui est très, très drôle, c'est que ce qu'ils dénoncent, le relativisme, est précisément ce à quoi ils ont succombé car c'est leur propre expérience et leur propre subjectivité qui leur fait encore croire à des vérités qui ne sont désormais plus vraies. Un prof, un médecin, un politicien ne sont plus des titres respectables, un quidam a accès à la même connaissance. La mondialisation n'uniformise pas les cultures, elle les défend en les rendant accessibles partout sur la planète. La consommation n'aliène pas, elle émancipe toutes les catégories de la population et leur ouvre des portes qu'elles sont libres de prendre. 

L'attrait du libéralisme ou plutôt d'un humanisme de l'individu réside surtout dans sa plasticité, sa facilité à être de toutes les époques et de tous les pays car les individus sont de toutes les époques et de tous les pays, contrairement aux petits privilégiés nés Français et serviles à la République et se déchaînant sur ses radios et siégeant dans ses Académies. 

Peut-être que je vois trop loin et que ce ne sont pas encore vraiment des sujets majeurs mais comment les individus comme Michéa peuvent-ils se dire que leur pensée a quelque chose à dire sur l'âge de la donnée omni-présente et sur les avancées majeures que cela permettrait/permet d'accomplir en matière d'écologie, d'équité sociale, de santé, de gouvernabilité alors qu'eux-mêmes se sont arrêtés de penser en 1970 sur des faits divers ridicules. Ils est certain qu'on se dirige vers un mur inévitable sur les questions d'utilisation de la donnée : Est-ce qu'on devrait rendre leur collecte obligatoire, sur la santé, les résultats scolaires tous azimuts, les activités, les déplacements et ceci afin d'atteindre un optimum sociétal et une réduction/réallocation des coûts. Je ne vois pas où se trouve le marxisme, le capitalisme et l'étatisme là-dedans, on se dirigerait plutôt vers un totalitarisme type Brave New World. 

Qu'est-ce qu'ils ont à dire lorsqu'ils retirent leur lunette marxiste et ne bavent pas les mots d'élites, de xénophobie et de racisme sur les millions d'immigrants qui rapprochent de manière intime certains pays mêmes très éloignés et les conséquences que cela a sur la notion d'intérêt national et d'intérêt général ? 

Qu'est-ce qu'ils ont à dire quand ils parlent d'écologie alors que leur analyse n'a rien de réaliste et oscille entre l'apocalypse telle qu'envisagée pendant la Guerre Froide et le retour à la terre.

An I wouldn't even say Italians invented it; I would say such a organizational structure and system is actually one of the most human and natural things out there. Fluid, organic &amp; free-flowing. 

The Romans institutionalized such a thing and made it formally apart of their government &amp; economy with their Patron-Client Relationship, and I've always been curious if the cultural imprint is what led to the precedence and influence of today's Italian Mafia. I'm not ragging on Italy or saying it's solely a Italio-centric problem. Although I am questioning if there is a connection in there with Ancient Rome, and if there is, whether it crafted a strong predisposition in Italian society for such criminal organizations to grow and become as influential as they are *(and by extension, bring corruption with them)*.

But from the Yakuza in Japan, to the Triads in China, to the Cartels of Mexico &amp; the mafia in Russia, this type of thing can sprout and spread anywhere &amp; everywhere. With the American Italian Mafia I would even say that our society here actually made it *easier* for such a thing to foster &amp; grow *(and we shouldn't forget that the Irish &amp; Jewish Mobs flourished right alongside the Italian one here in America; helping each other and making money with each other right along the way no less)*.

Funny thing about Rome though is that they took such a system, and despite it being so organic &amp; free-flowing, made it into one of the most stable, organized &amp; centralized systems out there. One of things I love most about Rome to be honest. How counter-intuitive their system seemed in reference to a continent-spanning Empire, but how effective they made it work.

The coverage of the EU election was a complete and utter failure though that made me lose a lot of trust in SR/SVT. Very little coverage and at Agenda they chose to have their ''traditional party leader debate'' with the national parties right before the election instead of focusing on the EU. Then they post-poned the EU debate until the day before election. I think this gained Swedish democrats a lot of vote since they are represented nationally but not in the EU (this not allowed in the EU debate but in the party leader debate) and lost a lot of votes for the Pirate Party since the opposite is true for them.

true,SorinCiprian,ROMA,Romania,"&gt;Ceauşescu’s political independence from the Soviet Union and his protest against the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 drew the interest of Western powers, who briefly believed he was an anti-Soviet maverick and hoped to create a schism in the Warsaw Pact by funding him. Ceauşescu did not realise that the funding was not always favorable. Ceauşescu was able to borrow heavily (more than $13 billion) from the West to finance economic development programs, but these loans ultimately devastated the country’s finances. In an attempt to correct this, Ceauşescu decided to repay Romania’s foreign debts. He organised a referendum and managed to change the constitution, adding a clause that barred Romania from taking foreign loans in the future. The referendum yielded a nearly unanimous “yes” vote. In the 1980s, Ceauşescu ordered the export of much of the country’s agricultural and industrial production in order to repay its debts. The resulting domestic shortages made the everyday life of Romanians a fight for survival as food rationing was introduced and heating, gas and electricity black-outs became the rule. During the 1980s, there was a steady decrease in the living standard, especially the availability and quality of food and general goods in stores. The official explanation was that the country was paying its debts and people accepted the suffering, believing it to be for a short time only and for the ultimate good.
The debt was fully paid in summer 1989, shortly before Ceauşescu was overthrown, but heavy exports continued until the revolution in December.


I'm quite tired to hear about ""Ceausescu paid all of Romania's debt"". He didn't. The Romanians paid Ceausescu's debts with their own sweat and tears and not the other way around.

Some of it comes from the readership not being critical or very knowledgeable about the respective political situations or processes in the respective countries, and a large absence of common international norms and dispute settlement mechanisms. Also, I feel like international news (when it's not involving any type of military or international security involvement) in excessively boring for most people. Nobody wants to read about relative changes in anti-dumping charges through the WTO framework, financial intricacies of IMF loans, or how LIBOR manipulations affects the global anything. When it comes to international politics, you really just need to wait for the dust to settle (especially due to the opaqueness of international proceedings), and then approach sources that are less interested in 'current' news, and will analyze situations more historically. For current information in international news you sort of just have to wade through the mud. If you think there is one place you can go for a neutral or true opinion you've already failed.

As I said before, I'm not that crazy about it. But for me it's not a bad place to start before going to more focused news outlets, NGOs, interest groups, or press releases. I feel it's definitely better than most other popular US news outlets that try to cover that scale and provide that amount of depth. OP wanted a neutral news site, and as I said in my comment, i'm not sure if I would define these as neutral. To your point I think it has been more pro-government, but I think that is the result of common interests with the current administration. I think there is a difference between bringing attention to issues that are existing, and deliberately manipulating the printed material. My opinions don't always align with what they print, but they're articles are in depth enough and disciplined enough that I can take that information from a source that covers a wide variety of sources and further research the topic, and not come up with large amounts of suspect source material, at least compared with other outlets.

You should.. there is nearly zero risk (I've seeded to 100+ Private Trackers for 6+ years with no issues)

Copyright Trolls/etc tend to go after the lowest hanging fruit possible (Publicly Tracked Torrents, Usenet, etc)

They use automated methods to send DMCA/letters/etc (like with Google and other torrent meta searches)

Anti-Piracy/etc tend to go after large sweeping action (six strikes, three strikes, etc)

Anti-Piracy/etc tend to go after ""example"" cases.. where they target an entire tracker and attempt to shut it down

Usually, this is done via ""legal threats"" or other methods, but it isn't always successful

..and the ones that have been successful, are rare at best (bG, UG, TheBox, Torrent-Damage, etc)

In the past year, most of the trackers that have closed are from hardware failure, staff decision, lack of upkeep, etc

* https://opentrackers.org/tag/shut-down/

Oink and other trackers are often brought up, but Oink was 6 years ago.. the others aren't any time recently

Since then, most of the top-tier private trackers have closed invites and/or restricted invites to a user-class

&gt; WCD, BTN, PTP have all been around for years, and this has never happened. Additionally there are automated systems in place to flag/disable any user who is downloading an abnormally large number of .torrents but never actually downloading content.

But it's a weird angle for a conversation. I discovered ""multiculturalism"" and ""diversity"" as bad words here on Reddit. I have absolutely no problem starting a conversation about how Europe could deal with fluxes of immigrants or how to deal with newly arrived people and the problems caused by those who are not willing to integrate. And nobody has ever called me a racist. But I don't joke about ""it should be 10 saved out of 300 instead of 300 rescued and 10 drowned"". I don't think ""diversity"" as such is a bad thing, and I don't think there's a conspiracy trying to impose ""diversity"".

I know that /r/Europe can be some kind of a hivemind sometimes, the Ukrainian conflict is a good example, basically anything that doesn't suggest Kiev is 100% candyland may be downvoted because people are afraid you're a Putin shill. But I still say what I think I don't need to go full Putin-defender.

I wish there could be some constructive conversations about how Europe should deal with this problem (and so far it's basically Italy picking up corpses on its beaches and most of Europe pretending the problem doesn't exist). But I'll always disagree with people saying ""I'm disappointed the Italy coast guard rescued them, they should have died"" or the full retarded ""we should shoot down their boats, that will teach them"".

I can't believe that the only alternative to ""shoot them down"" is ""you're a tree-hugging libtard"". 

Anyway, I'm not even sure you and me disagree on that many levels, but it started with something like ""racist comments are massively upvoted but it's not surprise because our European social systems are massively abused by fake refugees who have a negative contribution to our economy and the people in Brussels won't do anything because they are afraid of being called racists"".

Basically, setting up an account as an overseas resident (before you leave) is quite easy, then when you arrive, you need to go to the branch, show your ID and get your bank card.

Then when you have an apartment you can change the address with the bank when you have proof (a rent receipt or power bill)

1. You need the form, copies of your passport, possibly a copy of the job offer (though I didn't need this)
2. I use HSBC and they have a dedicated English support line, English speaking staff and their website is in English (for the most part)
3. The best is to do a telegraphic transfer - this does cost to both send and receive but is the safest. Stay away from western Union type services
4. Your account should already be open before you arrive if you give it enough time in advance

I used Paris attitude - they were very expensive and offered no service - they charge a month's rent to you the tenant for putting you in touch with the owner and then it was up to me to sort everything out (in French).\

I recommend Paris Rental Connections - they gave crazy good service for a recent rental http://www.parisrentalconnections.com/

The 1/3 of your rent thing is more a guide - the market is so competitive and so extremely tenant protective, they want to be sure you can pay the rent.

That being said you will find it very difficult to get an apartment without history (but it can be done with a good agent) - can you get your new employer to help? You do need a deposit - it is 1 month rent maximum.

Documentation is payslip (or confirmation in writing of your monthly salary from your employer) and lots of ID, bank account details.

Hope this helps!

Though, of course, if the US does not intervene, [Iran will beat them to the punch.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/14/iran-iraq-isis-fight-militants-nouri-maliki)

A big thing that's happening now though is that Shia Muslims all across Iraq are flocking to the fight, because if ISIL takes control of their neighbourhoods they're either gonna kill or expel all non-Sunnis living there.

Nice. Didn't they just uh lost at 20'000 vs like 1'500 ? So much for hardware alone... Ukrainian soldiers did better with 10% of that, russian officers everywhere in the chain of command and rusty kalashnikovs as their main weapon.

&gt; we may bomb ISIL to the stone age, but that doesn't solve the underlying issues that are allowing such a small force to plow through Iraq.

Agreed, treating the symptoms is what the coalition did since it went in, and hasn't fixed anything. 

The current guy in power, Maliki, i heard he had an habit of stepping on the Sunni to consolidate his power and kicked out anyone remotely looking they had any counter power over him, and that the americans looked the other way because they had nobody else to put in power. Is that true ? Because as long as that kind of thinking keeps running, he won't stop and that's just going to end up worse. If Baghdad wants to survive and modernize they'll have to unite and not start throwing kerozene on ethnic conflict and go back to good old saddam's way of nepotism and centralized tyranny. At the very least we occidentals should keep him in line and especially not quietly kicking sunnis and making himself new ennemies every days (but not yet push him out since that could make things worse, yes).

Because otherwise the sunni harassed by baghdad and maliki will just (continue to) tacitely support ISIL rampaging against what they think currently is a worse issue to their lifestyle. And when you have the entire population against you in an area, you loose it easily. The americans/the coalition might have had some local support (if only because they sweat and lived amongst locals for a decade), but now they're gone, and i doubt the average northern iraqi gives a shit about some shia he never saw giving orders from afar to suppress him. They might realize extreme islam is bad, but a bit late.

Then the ISIL won't probably go further than north of baghdad because they simply don't have the popular support and firepower to do so there; but they could easily become another festering civil war and taliban-afghanistan-II (i.e a place where the gov controle some towns and the rest is bumfuck rural taliban land). A nice way to stop that would probably making sure life improves for them and that the iraqi gov gets the credit for it (hearth &amp; minds stuff) , but that's probably asking too much.

Edit : I forgot the part where they should prolly fire or yellow (reassign to a closet) the entire commanding staff of the iraqi army. It's not just conflicted loyalty, it's just gross beyond-the-impossible incompetence. The gov probably replaced 6 month ago any competent soldier with a party random paperscrapping corrupt lackey, to ensure that the army wouldn't be too strong nor risk a coup, defying them or any form of independancy/counterpower if some previous similar situations are anything to go by.

true,TheDukeofReddit,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;He was a product of the US. He was made by the US to punish Iran for kicking out another murderous cunt (the Shah).

That isn't true.  He became the leader of Iraq months after the Shah fell and things were still unsettled as to how it would turn out.  The Ba'ath party had been ruling ten years prior to that. Saddam had been second in command until he became leader, although he effectively ran the country. The British and Americans probably helped in the coup that brought the Ba'ath party to power though.  They were turning communist and what not.

&gt;Saddam got loads of weapons from the US to kill Iranians.

Iran got a load of weapons to kill the Iraqis too.  A list of countries just in the region that got US arms include Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Israel.  Although Saddam did receive direct U.S. assistance via intel when he went to war with Iran.  Apparently, we were using spy satellites to tell Iraq about Iran's movements and military operations.  A pretty big advantage.

&gt;And wha are you talking about?

*why* these things occurred.

&gt;US foreign policy is one bloodbath after another.

This is why 'why' is important.  It wasn't the U.S. that created unstable countries.  it wasn't the US that drew the lines on the map.  It was literally done semi-randomly while drunk in some cases. It wasn't the U.S. that put religious zealots in power in Saudi Arabia.  It wasn't the U.S. that caused the events (world war 1 and 2, colonialism) which brought the conditions for these things to happen.  It isn't even the U.S. that has 'benefit' from this.  The US was the largest oil exporter in the world during most of this time and still does not import all that much in way of natural resources from the region.

The U.S. actually advocated self-determination after World War 1.  If the US had its way, the map would look much different.  How does a country run when a third of the people do not even want to be part of that country and another third hate the others?  This was actually a deliberate and patterned policy in European colonialism.  Divide the population, create a favored class based on ethnic or religious lines, then use this portion of the population to help govern the territory.  It divides the country, making it more manageable for the European powers to rule without having heavily occupy a country with military forces.  Things flair up? They have their favored peoples with European arms and training to put down.  Get out of their control? Then send in forces.  This policy had the effect of highlighting the differences between groups and breeding deep resentment.

Out of all this comes a fractured and unstable Middle East.  Why did the U.S. get involved? You might say its 'bloody' but I think that is naive.  Europeans are so comfortable in their own countries they cannot imagine that similar models simply cannot work.  It is forgotten that millions upon millions of Europeans died in religious wars. Millions more were forced to flee their countries. The religious peace that exist did not come easily.

Don't forget the ethnic wars though.  Both world wars had strong ethnic tones to them.  Russia, defender of the Slavs, swore to protect the Slavic Serbia.  After the Germanic Archduke was assassinated in the name of pan-slavism with the hope of creating Slavic state.  The idea of a master race may have been associated with Hitler, but the Kaiser was no stranger to using language and imagery glorifying the German people.  To do things in the name of bringing greatness to them... such as becoming its own colonial power and antagonizing the British and French in the process.  The Brits and French? These are the people that believed in the 'white man's burden' and launched 'civilizing missions.'  World War 2 shouldn't need that much explaining.  

But even more recently, Soviet ethnic policies can be blamed for much of the tension and instability in former soviet states. Such as Ukraine! they purposely resettled people elsewhere and brought Russians in, much like the British and French used to elevate a people to favored status in their colonial possession.  The Soviet Union even ranked the different ethnicities in how much they could be trusted.  Based on this, they decided who could settle where and who needed to be resettled.  In the 90s, we witnessed the break up of Yugoslavia.  That was pretty terrible.  

But yes, if you are in France, Germany, Sweden, the UK, the Netherlands, or so on, you live in a country that has religious tolerance (and often has an overwhelmingly dominant religion) brought by centuries of war.  You live in a country that is predominantly one ethnic group and most minorities share a large cultural heritage. You probably live in a country that predominantly speaks one language throughout and where its not, most people still speak that language as well.  Even in the more Western countries that have a clear divide, such as Spain (Catalan) and Italy (North vs South), the governments of said country generally function in a way that it is better for all to be as one.

To get to the point, the US foreign policy isn't so bloody.  The blood and violence are a legacy of European colonialism.  You can find this pattern in India (look at how much peace they've had with Pakistan) to the Middle East, to Africa.  Even in South and Central America you can see legacies left from how the nations were colonized in their conflicts today.  

I think it is unfair to say that the US goes from 'one bloodbath' to another.  A lot of the time, countries become more safe, more stable, and more peaceful. That isn't to say the U.S. acts like an angel, because it has certainly done a lot of disgusting things.  But the environments in which it has acted in this way are generally already dangerous, are already unstable, are already violent.  It is disingenuous to pretend like blood baths in Vietnam and Iraq would not have happened.  Vietnam now is stable and growing.  South Korea is stable and prosperous. Most of Europe was able to rebuild, is relatively prosperous, and relatively peaceful.  Despite the reputation, the Middle East has largely avoided major wars and many of the countries there are stable, peaceful, and prosperous.  Even in Central and South America, where US policies have been far more self serving, there are several success stories too--such as in Chile and Panama.",0,1402884697,null,0,false,0,ci8k933,t3_284n5n,t1_ci8k933,t1_ci8g6a0,null,1434256388,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

People in favour of a federation do not want to give more power to the council/commission/EUParl just like that - they want to reform the whole system from top to bottom. Try reading the link you posted under, it contains explanation of what they want to do. [This page](http://www.towardsfederaleurope.eu/federal-political-union/) about the political system they propose is slightly more detailed. This excerpt might help:

&gt;We would transfer to the European Commission most of the executive powers now held by the Council.The size of the Commission should be reduced, with its members nominated by the President – elect and elected by the European Parliament. Taking decisions by qualified majority vote would become the norm. The task of the European Council should be to steer and manage the Council of Ministers.

This would lead to a directly elected Parliament electing a parliamentary supported government, like any constitutional republic. The end-result of removing most powers from the Council is exactly what you want - remove power from the current national governments (who end up following the strongest few, Germany and France), and then split it up more equally among the Union and among the populace.

Finally, nothing is set in stone. Part of what they want to do is [convene a constitutional convention and have an open EU-wide discussion on the subject](http://www.towardsfederaleurope.eu/treaty-change-convention/), and if all goes well draft a real EU Constitution that's much better than the one that was show down a few years ago.",0,1402887519,null,0,1403817364,0,ci8llqr,t3_28329t,t1_ci8llqr,t1_ci795dd,null,1434257031,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The difference between you and OP is that your mother was born in Canada. Your mother had thus both Canadian citizenship and German citizenship by birth. Your mother got German citizenship by descent from her parents and Canadian citizenship by being born in Canada.

Since she held both citizenships by birth, she passed both citizenships on to you. 

OP's mother however was born in Germany and immigrated to the US. When she became a US citizen by naturalisation later in life (between immigration and giving birth to OP) she had to give up her German citizenship.

The top 3 countries currently have 32% stake in the eu parliament, any issues will be heavily influenced by their interest and ideological nuances will be purely symbolic.

I don't want a european union at all cost, and the past crisis and recent eusceptics have scared federalist into going for the quick and easy solution that is undemocratic.

My propositions are strictly regarding the parliament: make it representative within measure, every country above 35 milion people gets the same number of EMPs, (the same applies to countries between 10 and 35, 2 and 10, and 400 000 to 2), make EU poltical parties separate from national parties, make overlapping membership illegal make campainign budgets fixed/per each candidate. Establish a way for people(even within a single country) to suspend the passing of a certain legislation and ask a EU wide referendum over it.

Yes, these sound quite crippling, but the purpose is not to make it simple or easy to govern, but rather to make it fair and to make abuse extremely unlikely.

Corruption is what preserves itself. Judges are both paid and scared of assassination. Politicians too. Corrupt politicians don't pass laws which are effective against corruption.

And lastly, time by itself is not related to corruption.  Some times laws that fight corruption effectively are adopted suddenly. And they work. Sadly most of the time they are not adapted. And simply waiting a few decades does not make it more likely for them to be adopted. 

The countries which have effectively fought corruption are exceptional. They are the ones that are special.

There is nothing special about corruption preserving itself. It's common all over the world. The right question is, how could countries effectively fight corruption? How specifically, when the oligarchy in control of the country resists, both openly and secretly? How do you force effective ant-corruption reforms on them?

""His name forms the key part of the Czech, Flemish, Dutch, Scandinavian, and German colloquialism; ""I know my fellow Pappenheims"" (""ich kenne meine Pappenheimer""). It is used to imply tongue-in-cheek that someone has, is or will be acting in a way that is completely expected. The sentence originally held a positive connotation and referred to the determination of Pappenheim's horsemen. Friedrich Schiller used the modified sentence ""Daran erkenn' ich meine Pappenheimer"" in his ""Wallenstein"" trilogy.""

Yes, that Pappenheim is where the guy came from who's still widely referred to today, ~400 years later.

Hamburg is underrated but it has a wonderful Harbor that is huge and is located on the Elbe river which is the 3rd longest river in Germany. 
It also has one of the most happening red light districts in the St. Pauli neighborhoodand is really fun on Friday and Saturday nights. There is also a really cool bar neighborhood called Schanze that has a bunch of graffiti and posters everywhere with a hundred different bars and restaurants.The Alster is also a great area where a lot of people go running and sit around. During the summer there are a lot of sail boats! 

Since Hamburg was mostly destroyed during WWII, the architecture is fairly new and more modern than your typical German cities. Hamburg is fairly easy to navigate and you can walk from one end the other fairly well! But it just depends on how comfortable you are (I felt much safer in Hamburg than ever do in Cincinnati). Hamburg is one of Germany's richest cities and when you are near the Rathaus and cross the bridge, there is a street where there are just cars upon cars parked on there that are absolutely gorgeous (i.e. I once walked by 3 Porsche 911s parked next to one another).

If you're looking for cool architecture, just a 30 minute train ride away, there is a city called Lüneburg that is really charming (and actually where I lived). It has some of the oldest standing architecture dating to over 1000 years old. It's not too big of a city, about 70,000 people, but it's really nice and has the a street called Am Stint that is nothing but bars making it the highest concentration of bars per capita in Northern Germany.

Russia is not going to be just a simple member and just vote...it will try to dominate, infiltrate and hijack any democratic process to serve it's own interests, like any other big country with huge resources and a powerful military.

Da sind wir ja beim eigentlichen Problem: Bei allen Debatten dieser Art fällt man sehr schnell in diese grundlegend falsche Logik der Gewalt rein. Ich habe den Eindruck, dass es häufig folgendes Muster gibt: Erstmal ist da eine Gruppe deren Gewalttätigkeit in einem ersten Schritt dokumentiert und als einziges Erkennungsmerkmal herausgearbeitet wird. In einem zweiten Schritt werden Gegenmaßnahmen angekündigt und dann auch durchgesetzt, d.h. Waffen werden gegen Waffen eingesetzt. In einem dritten Schritt debattieren wir hier über das für und wider solcher Aktionen und kommen - in meiner Wahrnehmung - häufig zum Ergebnis: ""Ja, die Gruppe deren Gewalt am Anfang dargestellt wurde ist doof, weil gewalttätig. Ja, der Gegenschlag ist schon angemessen und notwendig, aber so richtig superklasse finde ich die anderen auch nicht.""


Vergessen wird dabei häufig, dass Krieg immer auch die Zivilbevölkerung trifft und das auch in der Regel viel schlimmer als diejenigen Gruppe die ursprünglich bekämpft werden soll. Das schürt den Hass und die Gewalt weiter; bestes Beispiel wären dafür Vietnam oder Afghanistan. Es geht dabei nicht nur um Wohnhäuser die bei Bombardements kaputt gehen, sondern auch um Flucht, Vertreibung, systematische Vergewaltigungen, Kriegsverbrechen, Umweltzerstörung, Verseuchung durch uranhaltige Munition und chemische Kampfstoffe, Traumatisierungen ganzer Generationen undsoweitert undsofort.

C’était prévisible puisqu'il s'agit de ""Petit frere"" d’Éric Zemmour, roman inspiré du meurtre de Sébastien Selam. C'est un récit à la première personne d'un journaliste partisan de la gauche anti-raciste qui va changer d'avis durant son enquête.

Le début de l’enquête est juste chiant mais l'on sent rapidement que l'auteur s’identifie à son personnage et que le roman à un coté autobiographique.

Puis vient un chapitre complétement surréaliste ou l'auteur/personnage nous parle de son mariage qui bat de l'aille et comment il ramène une collègue de travaille chez lui et commence à la culbuter copieusement sur une commode. L'auteur/personnage nous épargne les détails de ses exploits mais pas les commentaires de sa conquête, je cite de mémoire:

""Oh la la j'ai jamais rien connue d'aussi bien, y'en a marre des câlins et des caresses, je suis pas lesbienne moi, moi je veux de la grosse queue et que ce soit violent"".

If the pay slips look like everything was done correctly (tax was deducted and so on), the *Finanzamt* should be able to help you out.

Si j'ai raison, tu auras des résidences universitaires qui te reviendront pas trop cher (entre 100 et 200 après APL à Bordeaux).
Je te conseille les résidences qui te permettront de profiter à fond de l'école. 

Ensuite, tout dépend de ce que tu veux faire, le RU est à 3.80 par exemple mais c'est quand même plus sympa de se faire à bouffer. Tout dépend ensuite de tes goûts et du quota de cuisine que tu es prêt à faire. Je te conseille de faire une tour sur auchan drive/chronodrive/etc et de faire un ""panier type"" pour une semaine. Ca te permettra d'avoir une bonne idée du coût de la bouffe. 

Ensuite pour les sorties, tu auras très surement des tarifs très préférentiels ""à la maison"", tout dépend de ta conso d'alcool. La question est différente si tu veux aller dans les bars en ville.

Par exemple à Bordeaux : 
Demi bière : 3.50€-4€
Cocktail : 6€-8€
Entrée boite : 10€-20€
Ciné (étudiant) 5€-7€
etc ....

And instead of being threatened it could stop and think why it was happening. On top of that they could read the actual NATO agreement, which would reveal the shocking plot twist that NATO is strictly a defensive alliance. If USA attacked Russia, the rest of NATO would not be in any way obliged to join.

true,LordGravewish,PORT,Portugal,"&gt;My propositions are strictly regarding the parliament: make it representative within measure

You're defining representative as ""every country has the same number of MEPs"". You're ignoring the fact that the EUParl is supposed to represent the *people* of Europe, **not** the countries. Countries that have more MEPs like Germany and France already have much fewer MEPs per person than other countries, and you're making it much worse. 

Ideally the EUParl should have a constant number of MEPs per person everywhere in Europe - but that is only feasible if the EU were split up into NUTS2 level or something similar, in each every member ""state"" would have a very similar population size. (Similar how to the German Federation works - states are redrawn every few years in order to keep the population count the same so that the Parliament is linearly representative).

The Council is what you want - a house in which *countries* (**not** people) are represented, since every country - no matter their size - gets the same number of votes, very similar to the US Senate. If you want to make something more representative, try enlarging the council so each country has more ""senators"" (the US has 2 per state, for example) and make them directly electable instead of the current system of back-room deals within each national government.

&gt;make EU poltical parties separate from national parties

If you'd read the manifesto (and the more detailed links at the bottom of it), you'd know this is exactly one thing they suggest (pan-european lists, instead of national ones).

&gt; Establish a way for people(even within a single country) to suspend the passing of a certain legislation and ask a EU wide referendum over it.

I hear that a lot and don't know why people keep saying that. Is it because they usually write bad things about the FPÖ and the Black'n'Blue Coalition?

Being against the far right doesn't make you less objective. Objectively the far right is bad. And there is plenty of objective reasons to report on the misdoings of Black-Blue.
And it's not like they don't attack the SPÖ - more now because they are part of the government.

Anyways, I think there is a legitimate point to be made in pointing out that EU-skepticism is Europe-wide at the moment. It is clear that the EU has lost a significant chunk of European support.  We used to be able to say it was a result of the financial crisis, but now things are starting to recover that can no longer be the reason.

Personally I believe the real issue is the democratic deficit and distinct lack of organisation.  Why does the European Council have a stronger say on who gets to be president than those elected to represent Europe? Why do MEPs get away with being so absent at Europe-wide decision making processes? Why are we wasting money trying to maintain governance in both Strassbourg and Brussels?  Why are we not taking tougher stances on cases of corruption in EU member states? Why do certain countries get more sway and leniency than other countries?

true,CafeClope,ZZZZZZvin,Vin,"En résidence universitaire tu as plusieurs choix, le moins cher c'est la chambre simple avec chiottes/douches/cuisine sur le palier. De mémoire c'est moins de 200€ mais ça doit dépendre des CROUS et il faut aussi qu'il y en ait pas trop loin de là où t'iras étudier. En tout cas si t'es prêt à vivre en chambre, ou si tu n'as pas le choix, je pense que c'est le moins cher (tu trouveras aussi des chambres simples dans le privé mais bon, pour le coup j'aurais moins confiance, à part peut-être chez une petite vieille ou un truc du style).

Il ne faut pas oublier qu'au CROUS (en tout cas là où j'étais il y a un an) tu payes l'électricité toi-même (en studio, en chambre peut-être pas ?). Donc +50€

Ca te laisse 150 de bouffe par mois. C'est jouable mais ça demande de l'organisation : acheter en grande surface, grands volumes. Je pourrais pas te dire exactement combien j'achète en bouffe par mois parce que je me démerde autrement (càd je squatte beaucoup chez ma copine...) mais 150€ ça me semble ok si tu comptes bien ton argent. 

Le restau U en fait, c'est plus cher que si tu t'organises bien pour faire à manger des trucs simples chez toi (c'est plus cher que 100g de riz, 300g de ratatouille et une pomme) mais c'est moins cher que la plupart des pizzas surgelées. Donc tu vois le dilemme. A mon avis c'est complémentaire, sauf si t'es un bon cuisinier, moi au bout d'un moment je pétais un câble de manger tout le temps la même chose... et aussi c'est pratique quand t'es avec des potes et que vous voulez manger ensemble quelque part, c'est moins cher qu'un kebab ou même un sandwich de boulangerie (et bien plus nourrissant/sain)

Pour Internet il y a très peu d'offres ""single-play"" (internet only), de mémoire Free et B&amp;You, ça a peut-être changé. La ligne fixe c'est pas pour avoir un téléphone fixe, c'est obligatoire qu'Orange réactive ta ligne (physique, genre les cables) pour que tu puisses te connecter à Internet. Normalement c'est gratuit si tu réactives dans les 6 mois après la désactivation (fin de contrat) précédente, sinon c'est ~60€. Mais j'ai peur de te dire une connerie parce que j'ai pas pris d'abonnement Internet cette année. Quand j'étais en résidence U il n'y avait pas de prise téléphonique mais une prise ethernet et il fallait s'abonner auprès du CROUS (10€/m). C'est clairement moins cher qu'une box.

Given that speaking English normally heads lists of skills required by those who like to define the British way of life, it is amusing that a document originally written in Latin, before it was translated into French after four years, is being exalted like this. Here was a charter imposed by powerful barons – hardly nascent democrats – on the weak King John to prevent him trampling on their rights: it didn't satisfy them, and they rose in revolt anyway. It meant diddly squat to average English subjects, most of whom were serfs.

And I've personally seen it done successfully in another setting. Because it was handled intelligently, the presence of a child made the workplace more natural, more human, more fun even.

Although what most people see is the sympton(the abuse of a drug, gambling, whatever), what is usually the cause is something deeper. 
Harvard recently published a ten year study trying to find a link between Psychosis and Marijuana, and could not find evidence to support that thesis.

On the other hand we know that alcohol can lead to psychosis.

Mathematics don't matter, you can have 1 to 100000 in a country and 1 to 100000 in another, votes are what matter, and plurality is not achieved by the precision of mathematics.

That is why the council should prevail over the current parliament. The EU is a association of (equal)countries, yes this makes it inefficient and somewhat useless, but that should be the starting point, upon that we should build. Not due away with like they are currently proposing.

What links? Also, paneuropeana lists are again undemocratic, a powerfull party can impose (let's say) all swedish representatives on the ideological basis of free internet for all, but after that can vote for a law that requires all finns to always wear hats when in public.

That is to ""propose"" which is kinda pointless, a simulacrum of direct democracy if you will, my point was that the citizens of ONE country should be able to suspend a law that they feel is against their interest(yes this will lead to local abuses) but that is why the final judge should be the whole of the european electorate.

I fully support absolute integration, I dispise my local politicians and I consider them the principal reason why romania is fucked up as a country, but as long as nations exist, national issues will find a way in supra national politics and people will suffer based on their national identity, if you remove any form of national defence, that abuse will increase immensely.

It's under the Austrians that we've got the Transylvanian School and managed to enter the enlightement as a people and basically invent modern Romanian. After that things got better after the Horea, Closca and Crisan revolt and during 1848 we fought for the emperor whom we kinda' liked... until the 1860's that is. 

The Austrians invented the Greek Catholic religion which was a huge step in accepting the Romanians now that they were also under the Pope. And that was important because only that way we were able to put together an intelligentsia and stay a nation with its own culture and values. '

It was also extremely important for other Romanian countries as well mostly Moldova which, because it had its northern part ""Bukovina"" as a part of the Austrian empire managed to have pretty good relations with the Empire and send some of its young man in the Empire to study at Cernowitz and Wien and that's how we've got Mihai Eminescu and Junimea which was also an important part of the Romanian national awakening and its culture.

No... It's mostly driven by corruption, bad policies and ignoring the people.

I agree, it is more complicated than that, but my point stands that the main obstacle to a federal EU is the UK and that without the UK in it the EU will continue to exist. That's why I think your question, a choice between federation and non-existence, is a false dichotomy.

&gt; And anyway, probably the first question one has to ask is WHAT is a federation, what are the differences among the different types, what weight these differences have on different issues, and what does it entail for each specific country.

I agree, this is logically the first question. But I cannot conceive of a single answer to this question that will satisfy both mainstream public opinion in the UK and mainstream EU-federalism. To start with, the UK would never consent to a unified foreign policy. And really what is the point of a federal EU without a unified foreign policy.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"There isn't any way that the EU can become a federal Europe unless that's wanted by a very solid majority of EU citizens (and politicians). At the moment, it's the preference only of a very small minority, so it's effectively irrelevant to the EU as it stands. The current EU is a joint action framework for the member state governments, not an entity separate from them. It is *never* superior to the member states as a group - the powers it has above *individual* member states are those of a referee where the member states have agreed on pooled decision-making. 

As such, there's no reason to oppose the EU on the basis of something that might never happen, and which, if it does ever happen, will happen only because it's desirable or acceptable to the majority of Europe's people. It would be more sensible, surely, to support the EU as it is (in principle, given its many imperfections), and to oppose federalism as a tendency within that?

Not that there's much to oppose, really - mostly Belgians.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; The UK was a very strong promoter of a Common Defense and Security Policy.

In general terms, common defence and security is in the UK's interests. The UK, as a big military spender, is likely to continue to co-operate closely with the EU on matters of security and defence whether or not we are in the EU. [But there will still be red lines we will not cross.](http://euobserver.com/defence/113569)

&gt; I cannot imagine it against a Common Foreign Policy.

The current UK government is against it:

&gt; [Above all, we cannot outsource parts of our foreign policy, for example to the European External Action Service as some have suggested. Indeed the breadth and depth of the FCO is a great asset for our success in the European Union, and along with other European countries’ Foreign Ministries is crucial to our ability to project collective influence. There is not and will never be any substitute for a strong British Diplomatic Service that advances the interests of the United Kingdom. We can never rely on anyone else to do that for us.](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-best-diplomatic-service-in-the-world-strengthening-the-foreign-and-commonwealth-office-as-an-institution)

But I know this:

&gt;It is an agenda based on the twisting of British history too. Magna Carta – an English, rather than British document – will be the centrepiece of the values campaign. David Cameron wants ""every child"" to learn about it. Given that speaking English normally heads lists of skills required by those who like to define the British way of life, it is amusing that a document originally written in Latin, before it was translated into French after four years, is being exalted like this. Here was a charter imposed by powerful barons – hardly nascent democrats – on the weak King John to prevent him trampling on their rights: it didn't satisfy them, and they rose in revolt anyway. It meant diddly squat to average English subjects, most of whom were serfs.

**The implication behind that is bullshit.**

The idea that the Magna Carta isn't a *""real""* British document and that it's significance on British society &amp; culture, given the context of when it was drawn up, as being mute is...well....bullshit.

Mon assurance santé est une mutuelle (c.a.d. une organisation a but non lucratif), mais elle couvre beaucoup plus de choses qu'une mutuelle en France.

Pour le reste, je ne suis pas un expert de la question mais voila en gros ce que l'on peut dire. Il y a deux types de services de santé : celui qui se ""consomme"" (check-ups, bobologie, etc.), et ce qui relève de l'assurance (fracture, etc.)

Dans le premier cas, certaines assurances/mutuelles ont leurs propres cliniques ophtalmo, dentaire, visite médicale, etc. pour réduire les couts. Dans tous les cas elles ont des conventions avec certains hopitaux/cliniques.

Pour le reste, c'est de l'assurance classique. Les couts sont élevés aux états-unis car il n'y a pas beaucoup de concurrence chez les fournisseurs. Il y a un problème de capture régulatoire. Les lobbyistes poussent les sénateurs et les agences de réglementation a adopter des règlements extrêmement stricts, ce qui limite la compétition dans le secteur. Du coup, le moindre pansement aux normes sanitaires américaines (FDA) coute la peau des fesses.

Je pense que ce problème est plus limité en Australie.

Un autre truc c'est que les Américains paient plus cher tout simplement parce qu'ils ont de meilleurs services. Les plus gros labos pharmaceutiques sont américains, donc les américains ont accès en priorité aux nouveaux médicaments (le taux de survie aux cancers est l'un des plus élevé au monde). Forcément, cela a un cout. Mais bien sur il y a aussi le point évoqué plus haut.

Je n'ai jamais vu personne contester l'existence d'un harcèlement ""de rue"" a priori sexuel et a priori majoritairement à destination des femmes.

Ce qui est contesté, à mon avis à juste titre, c'est l'idée qu'il s'agit d'un phénomène unique (alors que je le considère comme quasiment indissociable des autres harcèlements de rue a priori gender-neutral du type ""t'as pas une cigarette"" et autres violences non crapuleuses), et surtout là où je dis bullshit c'est à propos de l'idée selon laquelle ce serait un comportement banalisé par la société en général.

Comme tu le dis, je pense que c'est presque uniquement lié au milieu culturel et socioéconomique, et même là ça reste circonscrit à une minorité d'individus qui a mon avis multiplient déjà toutes les autres formes ""d'incivilités"".

Certaines formes très mineures (et là ça dépend de l'interprétation de chacun, on a déjà eu ce genre de débats et il y'a des usagers sur /r/France qui considèrent que dire à une fille qu'elle est charmante constitue du harcèlement, j'y crois pas une seconde mais bon, admettons) sont sûrement tolérées et pratiquées même par les classes moyennes et par des lourds bourrés en retour de soirée, mais je pense que cela se limite à ça.

The demographic this would hit the worst would be the people who'd buy a ticket on a charter bus which would drive directly to the parking lot of a large supermarket or a mall, and then people would do their shopping, and then the bus would drive back. Another demographic hit (probably partially converting to the previously-mentioned) would be the emerging middle class, which would pack the family to the compact car (e.g. a Nissan Micra) and drive to Finland for a vacation. These two are probably responsible why there's so many large supermarkets in southeastern Finland.

In Finland, one of the companies probably suffering is actually a former part of Nokia (that is, the company formerly known as Finnish Rubber Works): Nokian Tyres. Russia used to be a major market for them - and funnily enough, while Nokian has a factory in Russia, the Russian customers were quite strict that the products they'd get had the ""made in Finland"" stamp, believing that those were of higher quality.

Merah and peoples like him can whine and pretend they have been given no chance, I don't buy it. For me most of these guys never even tried and now they are just trying to blame France as a whole for their own failures.

I am a bit tired to see articles such as this one blaming France for everything, the article itself says it : absent mother, violent father who dealt drugs etc... Does racism exist in France? Of course it does, every single country on Earth has its part of racist or bigoted peoples, **every single one**, whatever you do racist will never be eradicated because there will always be bigoted peoples with simplistic views. 

Maybe it would be good to start just living with them instead of always complaining that 90% french peoples are racist skinheads. The most funny part is when he says ""especially when you are Algerian"", yeah because it is totally written on your face.

But it is far from being the majority of peoples and comparatively France is probably much more welcoming of foreigners than the countries most muslim peoples originally hail from.

Also : 

&gt;This must have been especially satisfying because of how present the police were in Mohamed’s life: they harassed him regularly, imprisoned his father, jailed Mohamed twice, and when he was a minor, charged him in juvenile court more than a dozen times

So Police putting criminals in jail is harassing them? The words are pretty poorly chosen here.

The author is not opposed to the restriction of executive powers by laws granting rights, and is unlikely to be unaware or disapproving of the Magna Carta's historical significance in that respect.

There is not such a dicotomy between nuclear energy and coal/fossil.

Not only the green sources, like solar, wind or tides but also the fusion one.
People complain how expensive ITER is, but a single country spent twice as much in the Manhattan project, twice as much as the whole world for a unlimited, clean source of energy.

true,barsoap,SCHL,Sleswig-Holsteen,"&gt; Is there any kind of restriction to facist/far-right parties in germany or other eu country like this one? Because that could help alot.

Yes, there is, quoth the Basic Law:

&gt; Article 21  
&gt; [Political parties]  

&gt; (1) Political parties shall participate in the formation of the political will of the people. They may be freely established. Their internal organisation must conform to democratic principles. They must publicly account for their assets and for the sources and use of their funds.

&gt; (2) Parties that, by reason of their aims or the behaviour of their adherents, seek to undermine or abolish the free democratic basic order or to endanger the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany shall be unconstitutional. The Federal Constitutional Court shall rule on the question of unconstitutionality.

&gt; (3) Details shall be regulated by federal laws.

Similarly about associations in general, Article 9:

&gt; (2) Associations whose aims or activities contravene the criminal laws, or that are directed against the constitutional order or the concept of international understanding, shall be prohibited.

Currently forbidden parties are the NSDAP and the KPD, both practically for as long as the federal republic exists. The SED (Socialist unity party of Germany) didn't get outlawed during unification because they switched out the complete upper echelons and switched programme and branding to be the PDS (Party of democratic socialism) while the GDR still existed. After a merger with the SPD split-off WASG they're now called Die Linke.

There's already been an attempt to outlaw the NPD, which failed not because they were judged to adhere to the constitution: It didn't even come to that because there were so many moles in too high positions so that the court couldn't actually tell whether the NPD was controlled by itself, or the [Verfassungsschutz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Office_for_the_Protection_of_the_Constitution).

(Which gave rise to the chant ""Without the Verfassungsschutz you'd only be ten [people]"" in counter-demonstrations)

There's again discussions about whether a second attempt at outlawing them should be made, and one thing is for sure: If it's attempted, then it should bloody well succeed, or it's a propagandistic victory for them nutjobs.

At the same time, the NPD is doing the best it can to shoot itself into various limbs, organisationally and financially.",0,1402923575,null,0,false,0,ci8uhur,t3_289o3v,t1_ci8uhur,t1_ci8u2lv,null,1434261280,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Naturally smoking anything leads to a higher risk of heart attacks in the following hour, your veins contract. I´d wager you´d see something similar for coffee as well as it kicks the heart into high gear.

This is also targeting one form of administering cannabis, not cannabis itself. Which is just silly. 

The cannabinoids in cannabis itself are completely non-toxic and rather beneficial, both as CB1 and CB2 receptor antagonists and as antioxidants.

Here is a good videointerview with Dr. Christina Sanchez who works at the lab in Madrid doing groundbreaking research on the potential treatment of cancer with cannabinoids.

About driving, you said as bad as alcohol, what how much more likely are drunk people to be in an accident? There was also a recent study that concluded that regular smokers drove on par with non smokers, but once in a while smokers where much worse than both. (Which is evident to anyone who has been a regular smoker, you do become ""immunized"" towards the high after a while).

Although it should be common sense not to drive when under the influence of anything, your in a metal death machine after all.

Here is an overview over several studies with summaries: http://norml.org/library/item/marijuana-and-driving-a-review-of-the-scientific-evidence#Summaries

The short term memory loss from Cannabis is during the high, and regained as the high dissapears, so if your always high, you do forget certain things. ""you wont remember shit"" is you jumping to conclusions.

What cannabinoids can actually do though, is stimulate neurogenesis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1253627/), the birth of new braincells, which makes it a very interesting plant in regards to brain degrading diseases.

To really have this debate though you must at least have a certain understanding of the endocannabinoid system and its relation to bodyfunctions. (And cannabis is not the only plant or method of stimulating this system, however for now, medicinally it seems to be the best equipped. A runners high is actually extremely physiologically similar to the high one gets from THC, because the endogenous cannabinoid amandamide is activating the CB1 reseptors in the brain).

Edit: here is a great resource for studies relating to cannabis

They named them after Stepan Bandera, a Ukranian who is painted by the anti-Maidan movement as some kind of uber-Nazi.  I think there was some collaboration to get an independent Ukrainian state, however:


&gt;In 1941 relations between Nazi Germany and the OUN-B soured to the point where a Nazi document dated 25 November 1941 stated that ""... the Bandera Movement is preparing a revolt in the Reichskommissariat which has as its ultimate aim the establishment of an independent Ukraine. All functionaries of the Bandera Movement must be arrested at once and, after thorough interrogation, are to be liquidated..."". On July 5, Bandera was arrested and transferred to Berlin. On July 12, the president of the newly formed Ukrainian state, Yaroslav Stetsko, was also arrested and taken to Berlin. Although released from custody on July 14, both were required to stay in Berlin.

&gt;In January 1942, Bandera was transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp's special barrack for high profile political prisoners Zellenbau

So yeah, their word choice is a bit confusing.

Yes, he implies there would be popular support on the continent for the UK to join the Federal Union.   This is a recurring trend amongst British anti-Federalists, and I don't understand it.  If you can avoid much smaller sovereign concessions; Schengen, the Euro, the charter of fundamental human rights, you can *certainly* avoid being absorbed into a full-on federation requiring a referendum.   I never considered UK to be part of this movement at all and so get frustrated when I hear Brits against an idea they should not be part of.

Anche se ha fatto bene a Chicago e piaceva molto ai tifosi. Però Chicago è un palcoscenico molto particolare, i fan di San Antonio chiedono più solidità e pacatezza che spettacolo fine a se stesso.

Nelle finals non ha brillato e ha avuto anche qualche difficoltà nella finale di conference, ma i play off sono praticamente un campionato a parte. Durante la season, invece, è stato uno starter per parecchio tempo e ha fatto davvero grandi cose.

When did I say that NOWADAYS Germany does not use fossil fuels? Please, enlight me.

 &gt;and to say fussion research is not funded as it should be is an uderstatement,

Again, you and your problems of comprehension. I am saying that the ITER is the third most expensive experiment in the whole fucking history. Could you please tell me where do I say it is not founded? Please, enlight me again.

What I say is that the USA ALONE spent twice the money in less than a decade for developing the nuclear bomb (which lead then to the actual fission energy) than the amount spent by WHOLE developed world to create an endless source of completely clean energy in far more than a decade, which makes the ""effort"" of the USA even tougher in comparison with the ""effort"" we are putting right now.
Priorities.

So when people complain about how expensive ITER is, and it is, I just like to remember how expensive was to develop the current fission energy, a reminiscence of the Manhattan project (not even close to be the main goal) or the explosion engine, which development has been happening for many years with A LOT of money. We can't just say ""let's put the same money in the development of the fossil fuels and in the green sources, and let's hope the green sources catch up!"". This is not going to happen, for the historical gap has to be skipped.

I am saying that if there were a REAL effort in the development of those clean energies, 10 years ago we would have the same technology that we have today. If we don't have them is because we prefer to keep using fossil fuels, carbon and nuclear energy. So I am all in to eradicate all those three groups to make mandatory the development of the clean sources.

As you said,
&gt;Plain and simple.

true,Tom1099,POLA,Poland,"I'll write about late Austria-Hungary, precisely its northern part, because I have heard about living there from my grandfather. 

In late 19th century the country, especially Galizia (now Southern Poland) was very poor. Country weren't industrialised and any land reforms were coming very late. Adding demographic boom to this, there was a ""hunger of land"" - there was not enough land for many people living in rural areas. That caused hunger and strong emmigration (especially to USA). From economical point of view, Austria-Hugary was a disaster. After the war it started to change for better.

The ""Good Kaiser Franz-Joseph"" were generally considered as someone who cares about his country and his fate, but doesn't have an idea how to improve the situation. 

Politially, Poles of course wanted to create their own country, but on the other hand they were granted freedoms that they couldn't expect elsewhere. That's why they weren't too active in fight against Austrians and one of reason ""Polish Legions"" supported Austrian army in WW1. Ukrainians also were satisfied with political situation. Both nations had their representation in parliament, one of royal family members were called ""King of Ukrainians"". That ended, when the war started, and many Lemkos (East Slavic highlanders from Carpaths) and some Ukrainians were imprisoned in concentration camp, because of ""mosscalophilia"" - there was a movement among Slavs (except Poles) to unite under Russian rule. This changes the view on Austria-Hungary as politically liberal state, but my ancestor said, that there was a wartime, and those ""mosscalophils"" who caused that were idiots. But still, in the peactime, Austria-Hungary were for Ukrainians and Lemkos more liberal than the Polish state. Other important thing to remember is, that the country have united many nations. You could walk from Cracow to the coast of Adriatic freely, and the same was achieved again only 7 yrs ago. It was good for simple people who were not engaged in any politics and only wanted to not be bothered, like an old man from my grandfather's village, who were annually selling horses in Hungary and in 1918 couldn't understand why he is arrested on the border. When the country have fallen, the real conflict between nations started.

That's how I see the empire as someone of Polish, Ukrainian and Lemko descent.

I don't. This is a historical explanation of why the British state is structured in the way that it is, it is not an integral part of the way British citizens live their lives.

Traffic: smaller cars are more efficient than big ones. (use less fuel per km) Ships use less energy per kilo per mile for transporting a product than trucks, and trucks less than planes. Newer cars are usually more efficient than older ones (with an equal mass).

Industry: Industry is large and not monolithic, and I know only a few examples: waste heat from metal casting, food pasteurization and chemical processes can be used to heat homes and offices. Lower material use often also means lower energy use because energy is needed to make most materials. Recycling often uses less energy than making new materials.

Business: I'm guessing most direct energy use of offices is in computers and lighting. So the examples of led lights and laptops work here too.

New prime minister! [Alexander Stubb](http://imgur.com/hDaj2Lz) was elected by the National Coalition Party as the successor for the recently resigned former PM. His domestic policies are still a bit of a mystery since he has mostly worked in foreign affairs, most notably as the minister for foreign affairs (2008-2010), and minister for EU affairs in the current government. He is the first PM to actively support joining NATO.

What is known about his domestic policies is that he is certainly much more economically liberal than his successor, and he has consistently stood for lower taxes. Other than that he's mostly famous for his active twittering, fanatical athleticism, and his glorious teeth.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"This is one of those questions which is bedevilled by the issue of definitions. A ""federation of nation states"" is a hugely vague concept which does, as you say, have some support - vague concepts often do. If you count ""totally agree"" plus ""tend to agree"" as ""support"", then this particular vague suggestion has support of 44% overall (11% totally, 33% tend). I admit I would not in general accept ""tend to agree"" as ""support"" or ""tend to disagree"" as ""opposition"". And even on that basis there is nowhere with a ""super-majority"" - the countries where (total+tend)&gt;50% are Czech Republic (55%), France (55%), Cyprus (54%), Austria (54%), Poland (63%), and Slovakia (52%). I guess if you excluded the Don't Knows as well as counting both ""Total"" and ""Tend"" as support, you could claim better figures.

Personally, I'd only accept the ""totally"" on each side as ""support"" or ""opposition"" respectively, because ""tend"" doesn't translate into political action. On that basis I'd say the idea of even so vague a form of federalism as ""developing further into a federation of Nation-States"" has 11% support across the EU. Looking at the recent elections to the EP, we find that 62 MEPs have signed a [federalist pledge](http://www.moveurope.eu/newly-elected-meps-who-pledge-to-support-a-federal-europe/), which is 8.25% and very much in line with the Eurobarometer's ""totally agree"".

What confuses the matter is support for further integration (in some areas, where desirable), which is much wider, and opposition to a United States of Europe, which is not actually something that fits under ""a federation of Nation-States"".

Anyway, does that answer the question?

&gt; In September 1944 Bandera was released by [the German authorities] which hoped that he will incite the native populace to fight the advancing Soviet Army. With German consent Bandera set up headquarters in Berlin. Germans supplied OUN-B and UIA by air with arms and equipment. Assigned German personnel and agents trained to conduct terrorist and intelligence activities behind Soviet lines, as well as some OUN-B leaders, were also transported by air until early 1945 

And postwar activity:

&gt; According to Stephen Dorril, author of MI6: Inside the Covert World of Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service, OUN-B was re-formed in 1946 under the sponsorship of MI6. The organization had been receiving some support from MI6 since the 1930s. One faction of Bandera's organization, associated with Mykola Lebed, became more closely associated with the CIA.

Right Sector is pretty much the heir of Bandera, if you take a look at their Ukrainian facebook, you can see they consider Russia as a some sort of a sub-human Asian ""race"". And then, you have the PM [making such declarations:](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/15/world/europe/ukraine-crisis/?hpt=hp_t1)

""They lost their lives because they defended men and women, children and the elderly who found themselves in a situation facing a threat to be killed by invaders and sponsored by **subhuman**s,"" he said. ""First, we will **commemorate the heroes by wiping out those who killed them and then by cleaning our land from the evil.""**

But you are presuming that:

1- What the EU would say will be dramatically different than what the UK would say.

2- That the UK could not drive that voice.

Records until now say the opposite: the UK has a great chance to be the leading voice in the EU for foreign relations, since other countries would gladly follow its lead.

Also, its intentions tend to align with a strong majority of other European states.

All I wanted to do was call you out on your ""very small minority"" claim.  Can we agree that that was an exaggeration?  Outside of the British isles there are a lot of people that think this is a good idea.  I'm not going to pretend that there are millions ready to march on the street in support of it, but I am claiming that in many EU member states there are more people in favor of it than against. 

(Warning: anecdotal evidence incoming) Maybe it's because I stay inside Benelux for the most part but I have never heard opposition to the idea on the street, and in politics primarily from the ultra-right anti-Islam party.  Even nationalists in Flanders believe some federal decisions should be made at the EU level.  I cannot take seriously the idea that this is a minority opinion.

Just signed up today and spent maybe an hour with it. I am excited about the vocab depth - 6000 words is really impressive. My current course runs to about 2000 and I need something to help me extend past that now.

A few quick comments:

1. Prepositions, like others have said. Multiple meanings / contexts - you do need to cover them all. Maybe separately (like, meaning (1) for one card - and spell out that it is (1)? It might be too much to absorb like, 5 all on 1 card!

2. Verbs - the past tense conjunctions are helpful, but might be good to have listed if the verb has a ""sein"" auxillary. (ist geworden, etc). The seins are fewer in number than the haben.

3. Some UX flow problems that I found (a little) irritating. So I am skipping quite a lot of the words which I already know (brilliant feature btw). But whenever I hit ""continue"" for one I want to keep in review, then it straight away takes me into a mini-test with all previous words I've added to review. This seemed to happen *every* time I pressed continue. It felt a bit intrusive and really broke the continuity. Would be better if it happened once you have stacked 10 (or 5) words. Or if you had that option.

4. Also, I thought add this to r/startups if you want (brutal, but fair) reviews on anything UX or design related. I think they will say the design could use updating. But honestly, it looks good enough.

5. On the journals - it is not clear to me when I get ""English"" results, whether that person is learning English or native English. You would think the former but some natives appear to be journaliing in English! Would be good to have ""native"" and ""leaning"" tags by the person's profile, so you can id who might benefit from your help, and also, who might be a native in your target language, who is worth getting to know.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"&gt;You didn't use the word ""meaningful support"", you used the term ""preference"". Come on now, you don't think ""tend to agree"" equates to a ""preference""?

Well, no, not really (sorry!). I'm not just doggedly defending a bad choice of words - like I said, I'm in the ""tend to agree"" category, but would oppose a ""federal Europe"".

And I think this comes back again to the question of definitions. I have no problem at all with the idea that there are more people in favour of ""more Europe"" than are opposed to it - even during the crisis, and despite all the noise about euroscepticism, that's been a steady preference. 

What I have a problem with is the idea that this equates to support for a federal Europe. It doesn't in my case, and while you could call that anecdotal, it's actually meaningful, because it means that the category of people who answer ""tend to agree"" to the question about ""evolution towards a federation of Nation-States"" includes people who are opposed to a federal Europe. Unless I'm unique, that means you cannot use ""tend to agree with the idea of evolution towards a federation of Nation-States"" as a proxy for ""preference for a federal Europe"".

Which leaves the question of how one can ""tend to agree with the idea of evolution towards a federation of Nation-States"" while opposing a federal Europe. Easy enough - I support going some way down that road, some way along that path of evolution, and stopping before we get to a federal Europe.

The definition of ""federal Europe"" I'm using here is probably the tricky bit. What I mean is an EU whose ""federal centre"" is constitutionally and/or practically no longer subject to the member states.

Also...it's best not to refer to Ireland as part of the British Isles, in conversation with Irish people.

Otherwise, there really isn't much of a difference between ""ein"" meaning ""one"" and ""ein"" meaning ""a"" (the indefinite article). ""Ein"" must always follow the same declension rules according to the case system, etc.

3. [Nuclear Power and Sustainable Development](http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/sustain.pdf)

The abstract from the first, and most salient, academic study: 

&gt; A study was conducted to compare the electricity generation costs of a number of current commercial technologies with
technologies expected to become commercially available within the coming decade or so. **The amount of greenhouse gas emissions
resulting per kWh of electricity generated were evaluated.** A range of fossil fuel alternatives (with and without physical carbon
sequestration),were compared with the baseline case of a pulverised coal,steam cycle power plant. Nuclear,hydro,wind, bioenergy
and solar generating plants were also evaluated. **The objectives were to assess the comparative costs of mitigation per tonne of
carbon emissions avoided,and to estimate the total amount of carbon mitigation that could result from the global electricity sector
by 2010 and 2020 as a result of fuel switching,carbon dioxide sequestration and the greater uptake of renewable energy.** Most
technologies showed potential to reduce both generating costs and carbon emission avoidance by 2020 with the exception of solar
power and carbon dioxide sequestration. The global electricity industry has potential to reduce its carbon emissions by over 15% by
2020 together with cost saving benefits compared with existing generation.

It looks like the synthetic, crude-based plastics used in building solar panels leave an impressive carbon footprint behind. Based on cradle-to-grave evaluations of carbon emission--from the initial resource extraction phase to land remediation--nuclear power boasts one of the lowest levels of carbon emission. 

Not to stoke the nuclear boner *too hard*, but nuclear power also has the best [""deaths to kilowatt hour""](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/) ratio among conventional energy sources.

&gt;Prepositions, like others have said. Multiple meanings / contexts - you do need to cover them all. Maybe separately (like, meaning (1) for one card - and spell out that it is (1)? It might be too much to absorb like, 5 all on 1 card!

You're absolutely right here. Having multiple cards for this would be a good solution. Thanks!

&gt;Verbs - the past tense conjunctions are helpful, but might be good to have listed if the verb has a ""sein"" auxillary. (ist geworden, etc). The seins are fewer in number than the haben.

Yeah, you're right that the auxillary verbs would be helpful on these. I think this kind of fix is possible in the next revision of the site.

&gt; Some UX flow problems that I found (a little) irritating. So I am skipping quite a lot of the words which I already know (brilliant feature btw). But whenever I hit ""continue"" for one I want to keep in review, then it straight away takes me into a mini-test with all previous words I've added to review. This seemed to happen every time I pressed continue. It felt a bit intrusive and really broke the continuity. Would be better if it happened once you have stacked 10 (or 5) words. Or if you had that option.

Thanks for the feedback on this. I'm glad you like the ""Already know it!"" feature. Halfway through the project I was worried that intermediate (or even advanced beginner) learners would get annoyed at the repetition which is why having that kind of ignore button would be good. I looked at different kinds of memory algorithms and determined the best one that worked for me was one where I would see some words, get quizzed on them, see more, get quizzed on those and the previous ones, etc. I can see what you mean about being annoyed about the feeling of break in continuity of the words and can take a look and see if there's a way to have more words at once. I think, though, based on what you've said, once your review queue is ready (which should be in 24 hours or so), you won't see this same kind of break. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts then.

&gt; Also, I thought add this to r/startups if you want (brutal, but fair) reviews on anything UX or design related. I think they will say the design could use updating. But honestly, it looks good enough.

Thanks for the suggestion. Yeah, I think I'll post this on r/startups in a couple weeks when I have some more user data from the German learners.

&gt;On the journals - it is not clear to me when I get ""English"" results, whether that person is learning English or native English. You would think the former but some natives appear to be journaliing in English! Would be good to have ""native"" and ""leaning"" tags by the person's profile, so you can id who might benefit from your help, and also, who might be a native in your target language, who is worth getting to know.

That learning tag is a *great* idea. Definitely want to include this in the journal feature.

I haven't figured the charging mechanism in its entirety. I want as much as the site as possible to remain free and then think of some extra features people might want, but I don't think it will be for a while. Right now I'm focused on getting feedback on the site, get those fixes made and start adding some other languages.

Au 19ème siècle, l'actionnariat était très concentré. En gros, une famille possédait une usine.

Aujourd'hui, même si ce modèle existe encore, le capitalisme s'est beaucoup plus démocratisé. Grâce aux fonds de pension et autres fonds d'investissement, les salariés possèdent littéralement leurs entreprises. C'est certes un concept assez étranger en France, mais assez répandu dans d'autres pays.

Quand les américains sont prêt a crucifier ou pendre en place publique les patrons des entreprises du S&amp;P 500 rendus coupables d'escroquerie, ce n'est pas comme en France par anti-capitalisme ; c'est au contraire parce que ces patrons sont responsables de leur pognon ! Cela explique les très lourdes peines pour Madoff, les dirigeants d'Enron, de WorldCom, etc. Les américains ne plaisantent pas avec le capitalisme, puisqu'il s'agit de leur capital.

En France, la plus grosse partie de l'épargne est ""détournée"" (légalement) par l'État envers les obligations du Trésor (ce qui contribue a augmenter la dette publique). Ce qui n'empêche pas les discours du style : ""les étrangers possèdent ou achètent nos entreprises, c'est un scandale !""

Considering one of the discussions will be on the british-china handover agreement in HK, this is basically Beijing telling the UK not to meddle in HK or else with the usual lack of tact that is Chinese politics. 

Some background: Saying China is worried about HK is an understatement since HK is supposed to be a model for how Taiwan could integrate into China. Unfortunately, what was supposed to be a 50 year integration process was sped up. China is now ramming bills and laws willy nilly through their puppets down HK's throat.

like 3 times the people?

To explain I'll pull these easy numbers out my ass, and try to show you why it's wrong to use numbers of the MAB and mix it with those of the city:

- 25 out of 300 (the bigger area, more people) = 8.33%
- 25 out of 100 (the city, less people) = 25%

The first would be the real number (and by coincidence it's close to the real number, and although it be higher than other European countries, it's not the 25% with which the right tries to scaremonger).

A chacun son expérience de la vie et n'étant pas une femme (encore moins une jolie jeune femme) je ne peux pas forcément me représenter cet aspect là des choses aussi bien que d'autres.

Pour prendre un exemple, j'avais une amie proche qui était particulièrement jolie, souvent habillée ""légèrement"" et qui habitait dans une cité d'une grande ville (j'imagine donc que c'est le profil à risque typique de la victime d'harcèlement de rue). Autant c'est vrai qu'elle ne pouvait pas mettre les pieds dehors sans attirer au moins un peu d'attention masculine, autant la grande majorité de cette attention était plutôt positive (hommes polis et propres sur eux, verres offerts par le serveur, ""je vous dépose quelque part mademoiselle ?""); bref le genre de choses qui ressemblent plus à un bonus qu'à une galère et d'ailleurs son plus gros souci était la jalousie des autres filles. A aucun moment elle ne m'a fait part de 15 mecs au regard lubrique/jour qui lui parlent de manière dégradante, c'est resté des évènements rares pour elle même si bien sûr 1 seul c'est déjà trop.
