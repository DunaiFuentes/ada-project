true,_luca_,toscana,,"Domanda molto interessante.

Dunque, ci sono situazioni e situazioni. Per esempio, se hai già un figlio disabile, una situazione familiare complicata, e ti pronosticano un altro figlio con gravi disabilità, allora ben venga l'opportunità di abortire.

Se a me venisse detto che mio figlio avrebbe con ottime probabilità la Sindrome di Down non abortirei mai e poi mai. Prima di tutto perché non è per niente detto che una persona disabile sia più infelice di una persona ""normodotata"" (anzi, spesso i ragazzi con la Sindrome di Down sono persone molto più felici della media). E poi perché se uno prende la scelta di fare il genitore, deve essere pronto a tutto: se abortisci un figlio con la Sindrome di Down perché non ti senti pronto a crescerlo, allora secondo me rischi di incontrare tante altre situazioni da genitore dove sarai comunque inadeguato a crescere tuo figlio.

Detto questo non sta a me scegliere per gli altri, quindi non sono contro il diritto di aborto, semplicemente non condivido la scelta di abortire in certe situazioni.

Relativamente alle malattie genetiche dipende. Per stare sul solito esempio, la Sindrome di Down non è ereditaria, quindi non è che abortendo tutti i Down togli il rischio che persone abbiano figli Down: semplicemente non nasceranno più Down. Personalmente non trovo che abbia molto senso: è come dire che per eradicare l'AIDS ammazzi tutti quelli con l'AIDS, poi grazie al cacchio che scompare (no, non sto paragonando l'aborto di un feto all'ammazzare la gente, però il concetto di base è lo stesso).

In generale l'approccio di aborto selettivo mi turba un po', perché temo ci sia il rischio che venga applicato sempre di più man mano che aumentano le nostre conoscenze di genetica e la precisione dei test pre-nascita che si fanno. Rischia di diventare l'engineering della specie perfetta, e non trovo che l'aborto sia il metodo migliore per far questo.",0,1393521475,null,0,false,0,cfq6b15,t3_1z2vfw,t1_cfq6b15,t1_cfq5czz,null,1432585168,4,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,4

Much more likely, the US could say to hell with NATO and focus on Asia. The outgoing US Secretary of Defense said the US may pull out of NATO given how few countries are meeting their contractual obligations. 

He admitted that the political and financial climate wont allow most NATO members to meet their obligations any time soon, but pushed for integration to avoid redundancy. 

The commonly held belief on /r/europe that the US would prevent any EU integration of military resources. This is blatantly false, the US is pushing for integration, going so far as to threaten to leave NATO if European forces dont integrate. (although you guys and France are off the hook). 

He blasted every single NATO member voting for intervention in Libya, then hardly any contributing. He stated the US is sick of providing 75% of NATO's capability, and derided European forces for running out munitions while fighting an unarmed enemy (US knocked out Libyan anti-air defenses). 

He derided Europe for not being able to handle fighting an outgunned enemy that was a ""European issue in Europe's neighborhood"". Most European defense ministers were aghast he would come to Brussels and say such hurtful things. But he's right, the US is sick of spending so much money on a continent that should be capable of handling its own affairs. 

A couple days ago, the Pentagon recommended deep cuts (by American standards) to defense spending. Going forward I would not be surprised if the US is much more selective where it expends its military resources. Giving China's rise, Japan is expanding its military and Taiwan and SE Asia are a bit skiddish. 

Given the fact most of the US resources in the Middle East protect European energy resources, I would not be surprised to see a shift to Asia over the next decade or two (although much of those energy resources go to Asia as well). Regardless, the US is making large investments in renewable energy and has its own oil and natural gas resources (with some export restrictions, so price spikes will not be felt as much in the US as elsewhere). I think it would be extremely dangerous for European nations to assume the US will always be there to make sure gas and oil are flowing freely. 

So far much of the Defense Secretary's recommendations (some might call them demands) have been ignored. European defense ministers largely seemed to think he was a crass American and went back to business as usual. If the US pulled out of NATO and Europe, many redditors on /r/europe would probably need a moist towelette and a cigarette, but I can almost guarantee European governments would be less thrilled.

**TL;DR: I dont think a meteor shower is necessary. People very high in the US government have told Europe to get its shit together for years or the US would stop militarily backing it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Prima di tutto perché non è per niente detto che una persona disabile sia più infelice di una persona ""normodotata"" (anzi, spesso i ragazzi con la Sindrome di Down sono persone molto più felici della media).

Per me è un'argomentazione inutile. Non valuto quanto una persona sia felice ma come far sparire la malattia (non mi ricordo se è classificata così). Per esempio una sterilizzazione volontaria (prima ho dimenticato di aggiungere questo termine) è a mio parere l'unico modo conosciuto oggi per combatterla. Ciò non significa che una persona affetta da sindrome non possa avere figli (Anche se va valutato la capacità di una persona di poterlo crescere, cosa che andrebbe fatta anche nelle persone non affette da sindrome) ma semplicemente far preferire loro l'adozione o altri metodi.

&gt;E poi perché se uno prende la scelta di fare il genitore, deve essere pronto a tutto: se abortisci un figlio con la Sindrome di Down perché non ti senti pronto a crescerlo, allora secondo me rischi di incontrare tante altre situazioni da genitore dove sarai comunque inadeguato a crescere tuo figlio.

A mio parere crescere un figlio in due è sbagliatissimo, ma qui entriamo in un altro discorso.

&gt;Relativamente alle malattie genetiche dipende. Per stare sul solito esempio, la Sindrome di Down non è ereditaria, quindi non è che abortendo tutti i Down togli il rischio che persone abbiano figli Down: semplicemente non nasceranno più Down. Personalmente non trovo che abbia molto senso: è come dire che per eradicare l'AIDS ammazzi tutti quelli con l'AIDS, poi grazie al cacchio che scompare (no, non sto paragonando l'aborto di un feto all'ammazzare la gente, però il concetto di base è lo stesso).

Sicuramente non elimini del tutto eventuali malattie, ma riduci la manifestazione nella popolazione. Non bisogna ammazzare nessuno, quello non l'ho mai pensato.
Ma riguardo l'AIDS, finché non si trova una cura, non vedo perché uno dovrebbe far figli con il rischio di trasmettergli la malattia. O anche averli insomma :/

&gt;In generale l'approccio di aborto selettivo mi turba un po', perché temo ci sia il rischio che venga applicato sempre di più man mano che aumentano le nostre conoscenze di genetica e la precisione dei test pre-nascita che si fanno. Rischia di diventare l'engineering della specie perfetta, e non trovo che l'aborto sia il metodo migliore per far questo.

Occhio però, io non intendo sicuramente l'eugenetica, piuttosto un modo per fermare l'insorgenza delle malattie finché non si trova una cura efficace; anche perché intendo la sterilizzazione VOLONTARIA.",0,1393522684,null,0,false,0,cfq6wme,t3_1z2vfw,t1_cfq6wme,t1_cfq6b15,null,1432585451,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

This is an interesting argument. Wouldn't it be fair to open our borders to Third World farm produce in order to help poor countries earn export revenue? It isn't that simple. It is basically the all-out-free-market-globalization argument. Who is the winner of globalization? The industrial nations! Farming countries are the losers. There is a reason why, according to the Morgenthau plan, Germany was supposed to be converted into an agrarian nation after the war. Deprived of its industry, the country would have sunk into poverty, like any agrarian nation invariably will. By selling cabbages and potatoes you just can't earn the kind of revenues that will pay for all the imports a country needs. 

Hence, it is a poisoned gift that will impoverish the Third World even further. An all free for farm produce will start a race for the lowest price benefiting the consumers in rich countries and driving small farmer in poor countries into ruin. Having driven the farmers off their land into urban slums or emigration, the international corporations will exploit the land to produce food for the rich while the poor go hungry.

No, I'm afraid that's not a good idea. Food is not a commodity like any other. Food security can only be achieved by keeping food business local. In industrial countries that means subsidies.

For me, I don't care, if they would want pictures or videos of me jacking off they could just ask me and I'll send them some. But if it doesn't concern me, I just shouldn't give a fuck?

true,_luca_,toscana,,"&gt; Per me è un'argomentazione inutile. Non valuto quanto una persona sia felice ma come far sparire la malattia (non mi ricordo se è classificata così). Per esempio una sterilizzazione volontaria (prima ho dimenticato di aggiungere questo termine) è a mio parere l'unico modo conosciuto oggi per combatterla. Ciò non significa che una persona affetta da sindrome non possa avere figli (Anche se va valutato la capacità di una persona di poterlo crescere, cosa che andrebbe fatta anche nelle persone non affette da sindrome) ma semplicemente far preferire loro l'adozione o altri metodi.

Si certo, questo si, per le persone con Sindrome di Down è molto rischioso a livello genetico avere figli, infatti è sconsigliatissimo. Io pensavo tu parlassi di sterilizzare una persona non affetta da Sindrome perché non rischi di avere un figlio Down: in questo caso non va bene, perché non è una Sindrome ereditaria (quindi qualunque genitore potenzialmente potrebbe avere un figlio Down) e l'unica cosa che puoi fare è abortire se sai che tuo figlio sarà Down.

In altre parole, la SdD non puoi farla scomparire, perché se anche abortisci tutti i figli potenzialmente Down, c'è sempre lo stesso rischio che due nuovi genitori concepiscano un figlio con la Sindrome.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; This is an interesting argument. Wouldn't it be fair to open our borders to Third World farm produce in order to help poor countries earn export revenue? It isn't that simple. It is basically the all-out-free-market-globalization argument. Who is the winner of globalization? The industrial nations! Farming countries are the losers. There is a reason why, according to the Morgenthau plan, Germany was supposed to be converted into an agrarian nation after the war. Deprived of its industry, the country would have sunk into poverty, like any agrarian nation invariably will. By selling cabbages and potatoes you just can't earn the kind of revenues that will pay for all the imports a country needs. 

I'm afraid I disagree with you here. There is a huge amount of academic literature on how the CAP damages developing nations. The EU ends up exporting food to Africa, because the EU, which subsidises food, is able to undercut Africa, which cannot afford to subsidise it. Differently an African farmer is unable to export to the EU because the EU places tariffs and also subsidises its own famers. Of course African famers with less efficient technology struggle to compete against French farmers. But asking the UK to pay French farmers to give the French an even better advantage is a bitter pill.

&gt; Hence, it is a poisoned gift that will impoverish the Third World even further. An all free for farm produce will start a race for the lowest price benefiting the consumers in rich countries and driving small farmer in poor countries into ruin. Having driven the farmers off their land into urban slums or emigration, the international corporations will exploit the land to produce food for the rich while the poor go hungry.

Currently the third world has a very bad agricultural sector. If we should be subsidising agriculture somewhere, it should be Kenya and Ethiopia and not France and Italy. Those third world famers would like to be able to access our markets, believe me. It is shameful that we exclude them.

&gt; No, I'm afraid that's not a good idea. Food is not a commodity like any other. Food security can only be achieved by keeping food business local. In industrial countries that means subsidies.

Not really. New Zealand does fine without subsidies. Nobody thinks New Zealand doesn't have food security.",0,1393524899,null,0,false,0,cfq80dt,t3_1z1ach,t1_cfq80dt,t1_cfq79cj,null,1432585971,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Where I live it's very common for friends to get together for a day at a spa, especially on occasions like bachelorette parties...

Unlimited access without access to streaming sites may be more convenient than data caps. I don't see why ISPs shouldn't be allowed to offer such a service.

How? Assume you are new to the internet and never heard of of anything else than Google. Your buddy installed and explained NoScript and told you Google is fine. How can you assess whether any of the sites you find online are trustworthy?

&gt; Noscript is usefull because most attacks come through external sites which are just included in a side one way or another. Trusting the local site and mistrusting any other site is a good policy for the usage of NoScript. 

Almost any modern site loads external scripts. That's simply how the WWW works. You don't need to put all the code on one domain. And the only information NoScript gives you about scripts from other domains is a name. That's barely an indicator for security.

La tendance a commencé en 2007. Le FN rebute beaucoup de gens, légèrement moins qu'avant mais autour de 50% de la population. Par contre ce qui change c'est qu'il se fait rattraper par la concurrence...

&gt;D'abord, il ne s'agit pas seulement de ""réprendre"" des électeurs, mais de mobiliser les abstentionnistes. Ce dont je pense que Sarko est parfaitement capable (dans les deux sens). 

La rupture ne marche qu'une fois. Sarko n'est pas Superman et si on regarde la sociologie du vote de 2012, il a perdu chez les classes populaires non urbaines qui votent plus FN et surtout s'abstiennent souvent définitivement.

&gt;en réalité, le ""libre-échangisme mondialisé"" ne déplaît pas tant que ça: les gens ont bon râler, mais ils (y compris les électeurs du FN) achètent des meubles d'IKEA, avalent la malbouffe du McDo, et s'arrachent les gadgets ""Made in China""...et discutent de politique française sur reddit.

OK le commentaire bobo... [Les usines ferment](http://www.capital.fr/bourse/actualites/le-rythme-des-fermetures-d-usines-ne-ralentit-pas-878236) quasiment tous les jours, et le chômage augmente, et c'est en lien direct avec la mondialisation. Il suffit de lire [Guilluy](http://www.lagazettedescommunes.com/213826/les-elites-sont-obnubilees-par-les-metropoles-christophe-guilluy-geographe/) pour s'en convaincre. La pauvreté augmente et les pauvres ne vont pas acheter des meubles à IKEA mais souffrent bien de la mondialisation.

D'ailleurs le chômage va continuer à augmenter en 2014 car la croissance sera inférieure au seuil de création d'emplois (1,2%). Je ne sais pas où tu habites mais loin des villes Sarko et Hollande n'ont aucune chance.

&gt;Les jeunes, immigrés ou non, sont très majoritairement en faveur du mariage homosexuel

Je ne déconne pas, la gestion de cette loi a fait perdre des voix au PS. Les jeunes ont voté très majoritairement à gauche en 2012, les sondages ont montré une nette baisse après cette loi. Et chez les immigrés - musulmans ou non - qui sont plus attachés à la religion, le PS a également baissé. 

&gt;je doute beaucoup que le fantasme de la ""théorie du genre"" ait eu un grand impact.

1. Ce n'est pas un fantasme. [Quand on regarde les faits montrent](http://www.reddit.com/r/Politique/comments/1yz2xi/théorie_du_genre_dix_liens_pour_comprendre/cfp4epl) que le genre est utilisé pour avancer une rhétorique [de féminisme libéral](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9minisme#F.C3.A9minisme_lib.C3.A9ral) visant à l'indifférentiation sexuelle et donc à la négation du biologique.
2. Encore une fois on a observé une baisse chez les immigrés dont le vote allait majoritairement vers la gauche.

&gt; Quant aux dieudonnistes, tu surestimes beaucoup leur importance, sans compter avec le fait que Dieudonné doit recruter surtout chez ceux qui n'ont jamais voté, ni PS ni rien d'autre. 

Ce ne sont pas simplement les Dieudonnistes, mais l'affaire a suscité une réprobation plus large notamment chez les jeunes, avec également les mesures de surveillance d'internet, les limitations et censures diverses.

&gt;La différence est que (malheureusement, par ailleurs) les idéologies n'ont qu'une importance toute rélative dans ces partis. C'est pourquoi Copé peut se permettre d'aller à la pêche de voix musulmanes avec le ""Tous à poil"" seulement quelques mois après le ""pain au chocolat"" sans que personne (dans son parti) s'en offusque trop: il fait juste son boulot.

Le ""Tous à poil"" n'a rien d'un sujet délicat. Justement, c'est à l'UMP où ça se fritte dès qu'il faut prendre position sur un sujet important. D'ailleurs, ça fait bien longtemps qu'ils n'ont pas pris position.

&gt;Par contre, je pense qu'au FN les passions peuvent être plus fortes, et les baffes pourraient commencer dès qu'il s'agira de se prononcer sur un sujet ""délicat"".

Pour avoir été dans pas mal de partis, c'est exactement l'inverse : le sectarisme est incroyable dans les autres partis, vu la compétition qui y règne les gens te sautent dessus dès que tu n'es pas dans ""LA"" ligne, ou alors ne prennent position sur rien (le symbole étant la [boite à idée](https://www.facebook.com/boite.idees.ump)).

You seem to place the free market part on the ISP. One has to remember, the ability of competition is essential to the free market principle and markets where monopolies/abuse is inevitable must be regulated, perfectly in accordance with capitalism and market principles. An example of this would be roads or postal service.

Now, imagine a privately owned free-market road, where every driver pays a regular fee based on the weight of his vehicle. The owner of the road notices heavy vehicles makes more wear on the asphalt. Different types of heavy traffic goes on the road, let's say transport trucks, tank transports and large private cars. As he thinks of the private cars as useless wear on his road he decides to crack down on those. Adding an extra weight-fee on that type of traffic only would be questionable already, but he wants to go even further. As he realizes the ability to drive on the road affects the customers decision on what brand of car to buy, he sees potential to charge - blackmail - the car manufacturers for permission for their cars to drive on the road, with the excuse of them being heavy (which is, of course, already paid for once by the road customer permit's weight-fee). Of the current heavy car manufacturers most will opt out of this road, and only a few paying large sums to the road owner will be left. As different car manufacturers get deals with different roads, you are now left with a broken inconvenient infrastructure. There won't be any new aspiring car manufacturers either, because due to fees out of their league these won't have roads to drive on.

""Today, there are more English words on the walls of Paris than there were  German words during the Occupation."" - Michel Serres

Just a few days ago I tried tuning to ~100 French radios, you had American music on 80% of them. I don't dislike American music, but why aren't we hearing Russian, German, Spanish, Brazilian, Chinese, African music ?

Why is France obsessed with film festivals like Deauville and Cannes filled with anglo-saxon movies while completely setting aside the one in Ouagadougou with non-French people actually shooting movies in French ?

And as for the TV shows, seems like the French can't get enough of TV reality shows, that's not much better...

&gt; And, honestly, as a French person, both in citizenship and ethnicity, I don't think its appropriate to criticize the USA for its atrocities considering we have committed far worse....

That's the French-bashing going around in your media speaking. Sure, France had her fair share of atrocities, but contrary to what the French are being fed, she's not ONLY that.  She's also the country of the Human Rights, the Lumieres, the emancipation of the peoples, and the world expects from her to take a stand against imperialism, be it Nazi, Soviet, or American.

So not only can she criticize the USA, that's also her duty. People all over the world lined up to learn French after De Villepin's speech at the UN Security Council, because she showed that one could still have hope for France, she showed that there could be another Western world, one showing something other than the cult of money.",0,1393534583,null,0,false,0,cfqcvcb,t3_1yzles,t1_cfqcvcb,t1_cfq5qwq,null,1432588328,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The only issue with video streaming is data throughput, which is handled by data caps. If the customer wants to download 200GB of data a month, it's reasonable that they pay more, but it is essential that they can then download from whichever website they want.

The issue is not just video streaming. For instance, many telecoms companies, including AT&amp;T in the US, and Deutsche Telecom in Germany, have put restrictions on Skype, so that their own products are not impacted. Alse, it's well known that very small differences in website response times have huge impacts on customer satisfaction. Delivering quick response costs money as well, there's no reason why the rule could not be expanded so that Facebook or Google loads half a second faster than the rest of the internet, which would have an enormous impact on their competitive position.

true,tcvok,null,null,"As far as the popular trope of Parisians hating Americans, just be a decent, polite human being and you'll be totally fine. The classic advice, always say Bonjour, and Au Revoir. From my experience, Paris is like any big city. Some people will be very friendly, some will be jerks. 

If you're really concerned about being too ""American"", just try to watch how loudly you speak. Americans, and specifically large groups of American girls, are almost always speaking (see: shrieking) conspicously louder than everyone else, especially in places like the metro or restaurants. Seriously, though, I'm an American and for about my first two or three months living in Paris I had to constantly remind myself to lower my volume. 

Please do not worry about speaking English when you're there, I think that's pretty silly advice. If you're mostly in touristy places doing the classic sight-seeing, there will be plenty of people speaking plenty of languages. The people who work at restaurants and other locales that are frequented by tourists will often automatically speak to you in English (when they see you're not French), not because they're being rude, but because it's the language that most tourists will be able to understand and it makes life easier for everyone.

The only things I can think of that you should not do:

1) Do not have a purse that's easy for a pick pocket to get to. Be diligent, especially on the metro. Keep it on your front hip, get in the habit of having your hand on it at all times, or something like that. Pick pockets are impressively sneaky, and rampant in the touristy areas, notably the Champs Elysée. Tourists can make easy targets because they're looking around, looking at maps, talking to their fellow travelers, etc.

2) If someone (from what I've seen, always women or teen girls, always ethnic. Not sure if they're Roms or not, a Parisian can correct me here.) comes up to you with a clipboard and asks if you speak English, tell them no. Or ignore them, or walk away. You'll find groups of them in places like the Champs de Mars at the Eiffel Tower. After asking if you speak English, they'll give you some sob story about crippled children or a husband stuck in their home country. They're hoping that either you're a shmuck and will give them a donation, or that they can distract so that another one of them can pickpocket you. They will be relentless, and the easiest way to get them to leave you alone is just to be really rude. Unfortunate, but true. 

3) On a similar vein, if you go to Sacre Coeur (which you should) avoid the guys on the steps trying to tie strings around your wrists. (They're around other places I'm sure but this is most dense and most touristy) This is a pretty well known scam, but I was caught off gaurd by how aggressive they can be. One time I went with a guy friend who was visiting Paris for the first time, and one of the guys literally grabbed my wrist and wouldn't let go as I told him to laisse-moi and tried to pull my arm away. My friend had to remove the guys hand from my wrist because I couldn't. 

Now that all sounds kind of intense but Paris is wonderful and you shouldn't worry. Just be smart and you'll be safe and have a fantastic time. ",0,1393536551,null,0,false,0,cfqdw8q,t3_1z46ss,t1_cfqdw8q,t3_1z46ss,null,1432588810,1,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,1

true,HenryHill123,IREL,Ireland,"&gt; It damages innovation because it is inherently monopolistic, that really isn't difficult to grasp.

ISPs offering plans without access to streaming sites. I find it difficult to grasp what the issue is with this. If people don't want this option, then they could go with an ISP that offers a data cap. 

&gt;  but it is essential that they can then download from whichever website they want.

Why is it essential? Surely it should be left up to the customer to decide if they want it or not? 


&gt; The issue is not just video streaming. For instance, many telecoms companies, including AT&amp;T in the US, and Deutsche Telecom in Germany, have put restrictions on Skype, so that their own products are not impacted. Alse, it's well known that very small differences in website response times has huge impacts on customer satisfaction. Delivering quick response costs money as well, there's no reason why the rule could not be expanded so that Facebook or Google loads half a second faster than the rest of the internet, which would have an enormous impact on their competitive position.

This is seperate to what i am arguing though. This is clearly wrong. An ISP offering a package where certain sites are blocked is transparent. 

&gt; There is fundamentally no reason why we would want this

There may well be. A customer may not be interested in streaming. They may not like the idea of a data cap, for whatever reason.

Our banks weren't magically fixed, they're still trying to sort out who among the claimants really owns our biggest banks even years later. Our social programs weren't spared, we've seen consistent cuts in education and health which look like they mean to go on. We didn't spare the everyman, a lot of ordinary citizens lost a lot of money in unguaranteed accounts or in loans which spiked.

There's also the other side, which says Iceland fixed its economy by robbing pensioners...which is absurd, nothing the banks had was made government property, the government took the reins but didn't claim the banks property. You still have the banks holdings and property being divided among claimants whom the bank owed money, among them the British government who've already gotten the amount the bank did guarantee (Much later than demanded), and a EFTA ruling declaring the handling of Icesave by the Icelandic government legal. (Ethical is another question, but essentially the ruling found the Icelandic government could not possibly be expected to save every single banking subsidy in such a massive crisis and so the decision to let Icesave go under but save the main branch was legal, and thus they weren't found to be discriminating against foreign depositors as the distinction was made between main branch and subsidiary, even if almost all of the depositors left out were foreign).",0,1393536879,null,0,false,0,cfqe2hb,t3_1z2vs6,t1_cfqe2hb,t1_cfqdi8f,null,1432588892,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

That's not a free market. A free market would be allowing ISPs to offer plans to people which exclude certain high usage sites and allowing people to opt for these plans if they choose.

People with bigger cars already have to pay more tax. I never hear anyone complaining about that. It makes perfect sense. Why should people with smaller cars be forced to subsidize those with bigger ones?

[Bob’s Kitchen](http://www.yelp.fr/biz/bobs-kitchen-paris) is a nice laid-back vegetarian restaurant (veggie smoothie mmm), [La pointe du groin](http://www.yelp.fr/biz/la-pointe-du-grouin-paris-3) is a very cheap french sandwich restaurant where they have their own currency. If you didn't try those before: [Tartiflettes](https://www.google.fr/search?q=tartiflette&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Oq4PU9C6FaLb0QX37oCQCQ&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1242&amp;bih=607) in the [Quartier Latin](http://goo.gl/maps/02qNn), Moules-Frites at [Leon de Bruxelle](http://www.leon-de-bruxelles.fr/), [Berthillon](http://goo.gl/maps/u6oDq) has the best ice creams in Paris. Also go to the Mouffetard quarter if you didn't try it before.

For culture, you should check the many theatres (you'll find the affiches in the metro). For a original experience, you should go the very small and cozy [Au Petit Théatre du Bonheur](http://goo.gl/maps/asbvT).

For walking, go to the Quais de la scene which are renovated. Le Marais is a nice Jewish and Gay artsy quarter too.

If your grandma loves to dance and party, there's [Le Mohito Bar] (http://www.mojitolab.com/) that serves, guess what, Mohitos and [Caveau de la Huchette](http://goo.gl/maps/4y8PD) for amazing Jazz Swing nights (you're grandma gona sooo much fun)!

You should definitely cycle through Paris at night, from Montmartre to the Invalides (this will leave you with a lasting impression of Paris). Again, depends on the weather.

Also check those sites [CityVox](http://www.cityvox.fr/guide_paris/AccueilVille), [Paris Expo Porte de Versailles](http://www.viparis.com/viparisFront/do/centre/paris-expo-porte-de-versailles) for events that will happen in Paris

Well then i disagree with these proposals, but i would agree with proposals where they are allowed to offer plans to customers without the option of movie streaming. 

&gt; By your standards

They're not my standards. I have no issue with laws stopping ISPs blocking certain content. Access to the internet is a public good. 

I don't mind Governments having higher VAT on alcohol or fast food, i certainly have an issue with them striking deals with certain companies over others. Likewise, have higher taxes on bigger cars, that's great. It would be wrong to strike deals with individual car companies. 

The issue of streaming taking up huge amounts of bandwith seems reasonable to me - certainly with HD streaming and maybe even more demanding forms of streaming on the way. I don't see the issue of allowing ISPs to allow plans without streaming. That seems fine if it's across the board. Allowing them to offer plans with google allowed, but yahoo blocked doesn't appear top have any merit to me. It's pure profiteering. Yahoo is necessarily any more demanding of data than google.

true,xetal1,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;That's not a free market. A free market would be allowing ISPs to offer plans to people which exclude certain high usage sites and allowing people to opt for these plans if they choose.

Did you even read what I wrote? Free market is not the same thing as jungle of the law. It has regulations for reasons. For reasons of sustaining a market as free and competitive as possible. The nature of internet infrastructure - just as with roads - renders it impossible to have an unregulated market on it, especially as these can intercept other markets - free markets - which are depending on that backbone, such as internet content providers.
 
Also, how do you justify excluding arbitrary content? How would that not kill the free market sphere that internet is?

&gt;People with bigger cars already have to pay more tax. I never hear anyone complaining about that. It makes perfect sense. Why should people with smaller cars be forced to subsidize those with bigger ones? Clearly, a Government (or whoever owns the road) shouldn't be allowed to make tax deals with certain car manufacturers, but that doesn't mean that Governments shouldn't be allowed to have higher tax on bigger cars in general.

Of course they should be allowed to tax bigger cars. Just like ISPs should be allowed to bill larger connections.

Because that is what the EU is about, and it is what it is heading towards. As /u/cbr777 points out, the EU has been an 'ever closer union' since its founding and the governments of the UK knew this. They knew it for the Maastricht, they knew it for Amsterdam, and they knew it for the Lisbon Treaty, but fuck any idea of a referendum until it can be used as a political bargaining chip.

I know the UK has acquired a fair amount of opt-outs but I think it has to be agreed here that the UK is going against the flow of the EU in securing these, and with the idea of the 'ever closer union' it was, or is, a time bomb.

E questo avendo comunqe un ritorno in termini di coppia piuttosto poco sfruttabile. In ogni caso avresti comunque sempre a che fare con un tank sotto pressione, che è l'esatto motivo a causa del quale le auto a gpl (che è ben più economico della benzina e ben più energetico dell'aria) -non- possono venir parcheggiate in garage pubblici. La benzina, di contro, non ha questo difetto.

Quindi, certo che si può fare, ma se avesse avuto senso farlo in larga scala ed industrialmente, lo s sarebbe già fatto. Pensa solo a come sarebbero interessati i mercati emergenti.

true,HenryHill123,IREL,Ireland,"&gt; Like I say Its very easy to decry all violence by protestors as immoral when sat on a keyboard on the other side of the world. But as the wounds still present in Ireland show, Might does not right at all, and violence doesn't just happen in a vacuum.

The protestors in Ukraine overthrew a democratically elected Government. They could have waited for elections, which they most likely would have won, but they did not.

The Government had a responsibility to act against these protests. They certainly did not have a right to shoot protestors, but they had a right to protect business and law and order. People should be allowed to protest, but in every country, there are limits put on protests. 


 It's just so hypocritical. People support actions like this in other countries that they would never support in their own countries. The flag protestors in Northern Ireland were stopped with violence because they were blocking roads. I never heard one person suggest that the police in Belfast were wrong to do so.

true,delenda_east,null,null,"&gt;How do you justify not allowing people to purchase plans without access to streaming sites? It wouldn't kill the 'free market sphere' of the internet. That is just hyperbole.

  Because people can already choose to take data caps, as already stated, and then choose not to access streaming sites. 

  The benefits is that we don't differentiate between types of information, so if some other high-bandwith service comes along we don't have to negotiate separate circumstances. People can just buy the limits that are compatible to their favorite usage. This lack of categorization allows alot of liberty into how the internet is used, both by content providers and consumers.

Basically we are trying to avoid the method currently used by cable companies, as said by /u/ruskyandrei, which would be the best example of a non-neutrality internet. That of creating bundles, monopolizing streams, and forcing all or nothing situations on the customer.


&gt;Allowing them to offer plans excluding a certain type of site would be reasonable if that type of site is very high usage seems ok. 

The site already pays for the server maintenance needed to access it. So there already is a cost of scaling up. On the customer ISP end it's about the customer's usage, not any specific site. The current differentiation makes logistic sense, each pays for their specific usage requirements. The suggestion of adding an extra artificial fee on the content provider, despite the provider already sorting out their end of the logistics, makes no logistic  and physical sense*.

edit:*to clarify what I mean by this is: The extra fee would not incentivize the ISP to improve infrastructure for that service, since it has no access to that end of it. 

edit2: My apologies, forgot to add, though i should have, that people with servers already pay the ISPs to have connections with high upload speeds. So in other words this is already the case, but the restriction is again on the amount of data/second not on the specific service.

Also, you know that the American Imperialism was about Evangelical Christian zealotry, right? Some crap about Israel, the Messiah and ushering in the age of the Lord by the Sword. 

That weird as fuck belief went mainstream for a while, it was what got George Bush elected president. Bush was a radical Evangelical himself, his top advisors were bat-shit crazy preachers. 

But somehow the American left fought that shit back and got the country to elect Obama, twice, even though he publically supports gay marriage and abortion. So. idk, America is weird and its culture changes at ridiculous rates compared to Europe...

Peasant uprisings could also be seen in ancient China, it was even incorporated into the mandate of heaven, here are some examples:

""The Zhou Dynasty used the idea of the Mandate of Heaven to justify the overthrow of the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600-1046 BCE). Zhou leaders claimed that the Shang emperors had become corrupt and unfit, so Heaven demanded their removal.

When Zhou authority crumbled in turn, there was no strong opposition leader to seize control, so China descended into the Warring States Period (c. 475-221 BCE). It was reunified and expanded by Qin Shihuangdi, beginning in 221, but his descendants quickly lost the Mandate. The Qin Dynasty ended in 206 BCE, brought down by popular uprisings led by the **peasant** rebel leader Liu Bang, who founded the Han Dynasty.

This cycle continued through the history of China, as in 1644 when the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) lost the Mandate and was overthrown by Li Zicheng's rebel forces. A shepherd by trade, Li Zicheng ruled for just two years before he was in turn ousted by the Manchus, who founded the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), China's final imperial dynasty.""

The latter is not about liberty and, in effect, it would have no real effect on the freedom of the internet. 

I can certainly see why large sites would like to conflate the two. The former sounds alot more frightening than the latter. 

If streaming sites are placing an excessive strain on ISPs' resources, much more than other content providers, and if their particular business (off of which they profit considerably) is placing considerable costs on the network that would not exist if their sites were not utilising it, i would at least listen to a proposal to put an extra charge, fee, tax, whatever you want to call it on these types of businesses.

&gt;You're willing to suffer through fighting (or more likely, you're willing your children to suffer through fighting)

Did you miss the part were i explicitly stated that absolutely no one has anything to gain from war, and its a financial suicide? The second you start a war, every sane business who wants to stay in business will transfer to another currency thats stable. When you have a government on the other hand, they simply force you to use their currency, and  force you pay for these wars through taxes.

&gt;with the assorted famine and shit just to get back to where you basically are?

Why would there be a famine? And no, were not going back to were we are, we are moving forward.

&gt; And who would benefit? Anyone who SEES benefit!

Ummmm Everyone. A person gets caught with the wrong type of grass gets threatened with so much prison time that he has no choice but to accept a plea of reduced sentence. A bank gets caught laundering billions of dollars? They simply get a million dollar fine. The Justice system creates victims and punishes them. Those who are really criminals never end in jail. Look at Yanukovitch. Hes fine. And Rich.

&gt;Someone owns something someone else with more means of keeping armed forces wants is probably going to end up losing it and everything else.

Once again, war is financial suicide. If a company wants something i have, they offer me something in exchange. If we are both happy, we make the exchange, if we are not happy, we dont make the exchange. If company tries to use force to take it from me (kind of like the government), they will get bad publicity, and no one will do business with them.

&gt;You're willing to throw EVERYTHING to the wind on the off-chance it might possibly become slightly better for you personally?

Several things. 
First, Yes. The Greeks risked everything when the Persians invaded, the Americans risked everything when British oppressed them, the French risked everything once the nobility abused them.
Second. Its not slightly better, and its not for me. Its for everyone. We have a world were no one is forced to pay taxes, forced to fight wars, forced to finance organizations they dont support. The list goes on and on. I want Justice and Freedom.

Closing Remarks: You think the way government wants you to think. They raise you to believe you need them to protect you, feed you, shelter you. Slaves in Rome were raised with the same mentality, as were the people of Europe during the middle ages. You dont need anyone to rule you, you are perfectly capable of making life decisions on your own. If you would rather life as an obedient little slave, go ahead, thats your choice.

QUICK EDIT: Here is an example of how the situation in Ukraine would end up with my system.

People in the west want to do buisness with Europe? They do business with Europe.
People in the east want to do buisness with Russia? They do business with Russia.
See how simple that is? No need to fight, protest, get thrown in prison ect.

Instead we have an oppressive government which makes a decision the people dont like. The people protest, the government uses force to solve the problem, the people fight back, the government gets overthrown. Now Russia is using this uprising as a Cassus Beli(however you spell that) to exert its power of Crimean.

L'idrogeno è un media energetico, cioè una sostanza chimicamente dotata di una certa capacità energetica. Devi immaganizzarlo sotto pressione perchè altrimenti, essendo un gas, avresti una densità di trasporto risibile.
L'aria compressa è, per l'appunto, aria, e non ha capacità calorica (se escludiamo il mero contenuto di ossigeno, azoto e tracce di altri gas). La sua 'utilizzabilità' deriva solo ed esclusivamente dal fatto che la usi per immagazzinare energia sotto forma di pressione, ed alla stessa precisa maniera potresti usare qualsiasi altro gas, col vantaggio che però l'aria è un po' tutto attorno a te.

Le ibride, perdonami il francesismo, non c'entra un cazzo, e qualsiasi corso di Fisica1 te lo potrà confermare.

Potresti comprimere l'aria direttamente a bordo dell'automobile, con un compressore elettrico, e togliendoti così la necessità dell'avere delle pompe di gas/aria. Ma l'efficienza col quale lo faresti sarebbe probabilmente pessima, e non potresti comunque farlo on-the-go, in quanto spenderesti più energia elettrica per comprimere l'aria di quanta ne potresti produrre grazie all'aria immagazzinata (seconda legge della termodinamica, ancora Fisica1, altrimenti avresti inventato quantomeno una macchina a moto perpetuo,  meglio avresti risolto i problemi energetici del globo). Saresti però nella stessa medesima situazione dell'idrogeno, che potresti tranquillamente produrre onboard (ammesso che tu metta l'acqua), ma anche qui avresti una efficienza pessima.

Mi permetto poi di dirti che le opinioni sono, per l'appunto, opinabili e personali: a me delle donne piacciono le gambe ed il culo, mentre tu magari preferisci le tette. La mia opinione/gusto vale quanto la tua, e viceversa. I fatti scientifici no, o dici quella che è la verità scientifica (nel senso epistemologico della verità, s'intende), o stai solo sparando orrende cazzate da idiota, cosa che grillo è bravissimo a fare, non so però se per calcolo o per pura e semplice ignoranza da capra.

I suppose my problem with that is that this isn't really what the UK is advocating. I find it hard to envisage a time in the near future where the UK would be willing to have over more power to the EU, so it would likely just be 'one step back', and then a return of the opt-outs again the second most of the EU (certainly the Eurozone) gets back on track with its ever closer union

I'll happily admit though that a big reason I couldn't personally support your notion of a rethink is that I don't trust Cameron in the task and suspect it would merely be used as an opportunity to gain more support by looking tough on the EU (on topics such as sovereignty, or immigration) whilst trying to fuck over workers rights

It is pretty common in developed agricultural economies to massively subsidize farming. Better technology also helps. For instance, subsidies that were normal in Canada and the US have severely hurt farming in Mexico. Trade agreements between highly disparate economies will often have winners in some industries and losers in others. 

Personally I think agriculture should have been excluded from NAFTA. It is a sticking point between US/EU trade negotiations, Canada/EU trade negotiations, and almost every trade deal inked in this day and age. The US, Canada, and several EU countries can undercut many producers from smaller, and usually poorer farmers, and can often put them out of business. 

The argument for free trade with subsidized agricultural economies is consumers in import countries get cheaper food. But it can cause a lot of havoc, especially to local agriculture communities. 

US food aid was making it difficult for farmers in the poorest parts of the world to compete. Recently the US announced a change in policy to buy locally grown food from farmers instead of shipping its own food to help counter the damage US food aid was doing to local economies (although in all fairness it did help people not starve, I am not completely disparaging it). Obviously corruption will be a new variable. Money is much more coveted than rice by governing elite, even in the most desperately poor countries. But if done properly, I think it is a good change. A Danish shipper that delivers US food aid is aggressively fighting this change and essentially making it sound like the global shipping industry is going to collapse because of this, but what can you do. Every action will piss someone off I guess.

""( Trois anecdotes: Robocop a été tourné entièrement à Houston, Texas :D ; Detroit songeait très sérieusement à ériger une statue en hommage à l'acteur sous l'armure: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWdA9kIOQCU ; et il y'a eu deux séries télé  Robocop - coucou M6 - avec là encore, dans certains épisodes, d'effrayants aperçus visionnaires du futur) 
 
ED 209 peut effectivement être vu comme une prémonition des drones tueurs entre autre chose; vous avez ensuite la méga corporation qui privatise la police de fait [c'est déjà fait pour la guerre] et le triomphe de la puissance financière privée sur les pouvoirs publics en déliquescence; les bulletins d'infos aux catastrophes naturelles ou technologiques épouvantables tellement banales qu'elles sont entrecoupées de pubs; le crime organisé qui prospère  et qui est de mèche avec les élites [cf les petits soucis judiciaires de l'UMP :o]; la pauvreté et le chômage généralisé; les progrès fulgurants en science, notamment technomédecine, implants et prothèses...; et le maître mot de l'univers cyberpunk de Robocop: le decay, superbe terme anglais qui s'applique si précisément aux conséquences de la crise de 2007 (et qui peut se traduire en français par ""pourriture / corrosion / délabrement"" ); 
 
Rappelons également que Robocop 2 a une scène de téléthon dans laquelle les citoyens sont  invités à appeler pour sauver les finances de la ville [une idée à creuser en Europe, et en béta test ces temps-ci à l'UMP], , et que même jusque dans une scène effacée, il trouve le moyen de préfigurer le réchauffement climatique et l'impact écologique de nos sociétés... http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x [...] &amp;start=226 
 
Ah, c'est obligé, vous allez revoir ce WE ou pendant vos congés d'été Robocop 1 et 2, Terminator 1 et 2, Mad Max 1 et 2, Alien 1 et 2, Gremlins 1 et 2, et tant d'autres, et peut être même étendre à la trilogie Die Hard, les films de John Woo, Predator 1 et 2, Running Man, Total Recall, les Dirty Harry, les trilogies BTTF, Indiana Jones, Evil Dead... 
 
Et ce ne sera pas seulement par nostalgie, ou par envie de testostérone... 
 
Mais parce que - probablement - la dernière fois que vous avez regardé ces perles, vous étiez ado, et vous le regardiez en VHS tout pourri censuré ou raccourci ou abîmé sur une télé cathodique mono. 
 
Vous êtes maintenant adulte, ce qui vous donne le bagage culturel, politique, et d'expérience de la vie pour comprendre la satire ou ce qui ce dessine en arrière-plan de ces films (pour certains :o), apprécier encore plus les histoires d'amour et de cul, les émotions, le stress, les efforts physiques, la douleur, les malentendus et quiproquos, la bande son et les poursuites en bagnole... et vous avez maintenant accès aux Blue Ray - 1080 p - THX 5.1 DTS Dolby Surround Director's Cut - Extended Definitive Edition Restaurée - Scènes Effacées/Prolongées qui étendent l'histoire, la profondeur des personnages et de l'univers histoire de faire saigner vos yeux et vos oreilles de bonheur.""

There is a difference between traditional spying targeting government or military institutions and mass surveillance of an entire population that is the precursor of a total control.

Also, this pretense a reciprocity of spying is absurd. If the German secrete service where to tap Obama's phone from its embassy in Washington and collect the private data of tens of millions of American citizens there would be an uproar. It is simply not imaginable. 

Moreover, the pretense that you spy on allies is equally false. You don't spy on the UK but you spy on continental Europe like on enemy territory. 

The US deserves every bit of sh*t that's been thrown at it over the spying affair.

And no, we certainly should not sign any trade deal until we are absolutely certain that our laws are not violated by the US.

true,3dom,RUSS,Soviet Reunion,"TL;DR: Russian military forces have seized control over two airports in Crimea to prevent arrival of Kiev officials

Note: I've traced [original article on Interfax website](http://www.interfax.ru/world/txt/361733) - they've corrected it: these are ""Crimean self-defense"" forces. However they have military equipment and training and there is no way civilians could acquire military weapons in Ukraine - it's nearly impossible to have even hunting weapon (as you could see during protests in Kiev there were just few low power weapons among protesters).

[+ link](http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/belbek/): Ukrainian minister of internal affairs is blaming Russia for military invasion [on his Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/arsen.avakov.1/posts/597469000343210?stream_ref=5).

\+ 1 link (this time in English): 150 Crimean ""Berkut"" officers are [blocking traffic to/from Crimea on Perekopsky isthmus](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/report-crimean-berkut-police-on-perekopsky-isthmus-to-prevent-armed-invasion-337859.html).

And one more link: [Russian parliament is readying laws to accept Crimea into Russian Federation](http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/cometous/).

And to remind you: [in September Russian officials clearly stated they won't guarantee peace and stability in Ukraine](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/22/ukraine-european-union-trade-russia) if it will accept EU trade agreement. Quote from Mr. Glazyev: ""Ukrainian authorities make a huge mistake if they think that the Russian reaction will become neutral in a few years from now. This will not happen ... Signing this treaty will lead to political and social unrest,"" said the Kremlin aide. ""The living standard will decline dramatically … there will be chaos."" It sounds like promise - which is being fulfilled now.

update: Russian lawmakers to allow Ukrainians to get [Russian citizenship instantly](http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/passports/) - without leaving Ukraine, without living in Russia, without source of income confirmation, etc. etc. For me it looks like obvious preparation for invasion to ""protect Russian citizens"" - just like it happened in Georgia in 2008.

note: Russian political elite is partially prepared for conflict with the West as [they have accepted a law which forbid them to have accounts in foreign banks](http://izvestia.ru/news/562716) - as recently as in December, 2013. I.e. many of them transferred at least some of their money back into Russia.

update: [Russian naval forces had blocked Ukrainian border guards in Balaklava](http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/rus/) (+ [link to official Ukrainian site](http://dpsu.gov.ua/ua/about/news/news_3401.htm)) +10 Russian military helicopters have crossed Ukrainian borders ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TVyPiHVZ1A&amp;feature=youtu.be)). They don't hide anymore.

update: [during conference in Rostov-on-Don Yanukovich demanded to leave Crimea within Ukrainian state](http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/krym/). It seems Kremlin want to negotiate his restoration in exchange for Crimea (which is impossible) - or just convince public Russia isn't going to invade eastern Ukraine despite they are clearly going to ""protect Russian citizens"" asap. Probably Kremlin need timeout for couple days to hand out at least few passports in Kharkiv and Donetsk - before actually sending tanks there.

update: Kremlin refused to talk with Ukraine over situation in Crimea as it's ""[inner Ukrainian situation](http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/note/)"" and Russian military in Crimea is just protecting itself.

update: Yanukovich said he is against invasion into Ukraine. It seems he doesn't know about situation in Crimea.  (no link, I'm listening to live translation)

edit: thanks for the ""gold"" for this dark comment!

edit: and thanks again for second gold! However I hope I won't become Reddit-rich from commenting military conflicts...

update: [militants have abandoned airports](http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/simfer/) + [Crimean population has created petition to Putin to avoid using military forces in Crimea](http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/nowarplease/). Yet the laws (possibility to accept new regions + Russian passports for Ukrainians) remain in the work + invaded military helicopters are still in the region.

[Russia is starting to give away passports in Ukraine](http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/pass/) - to disbanded Crimean ""Berkut"" officers.

It looks like Ukrainian army has awoken and [closed space for airplanes in Crimea](http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/closed/), flights are being relocated elsewhere. [Zhirinovsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Zhirinovsky) stuck in there.

&gt; 10 zł per kilogram young dog , 12 zł per kilogram cat - but is ready to pay one of the companies . The offer received shelters throughout the country. Environmentalists intend to notify the prosecutor's office about the possibility of committing a crime .
On the mailbox Municipal Animal Shelter in Bielsko -Biala came yesterday 's offer Exotic Meat Poland . The company offers shelter to cooperate. "" It would consist of acquiring the Exotic Meat Poland healthy animals and transporting them to countries in Western Europe and the Far East. Can receive 40-50 animals per month "" - we read in the mail.

&gt;According to animal rights alone company - Exotic Meats - and buying up animals kilograms testify to the fact that they are intended for slaughter.

&gt;Exotic Meat Poland offers 10 zł per kilogram dog having less than half a year , or 6.50 zł per kilogram of older animals . The company is also interested in buying cats - proposes 12 zł per kilogram of animals less than half a year , or 8 zł for the elderly.

&gt;The suspect mail alerted us one of the vets shelter. It turns out that such an offer received in the last days of youth throughout the country , including in Korabiewicach , Celestynow , Milanówek . Some considered it a stupid joke or provocation either organization fighting for the rights of animals . The offer is given a phone number to Mr. Andrew, sales manager of the company. We called , pretending to be interested in the offer .

&gt;- What's next for these animals will happen ? Why even buys them ? This is a legal activity ? - Try to find out.

&gt;- It's a matter of our counterparty . Why would it be illegal ? For us it's business activities , we believe that we can be competitive in this market - we heard from Mr. Andrew. - Are you interested in entering into this ? - Asked .

&gt;Under the given phone number in the mail also called Anna desire of Positive Change Foundation . - I was hoping it was a joke , that no such number exists . I did not want to believe that such a thing is possible. Associations I such that I felt poorly . Animals of our shelters are expected to be good homes , they should not be exported abroad somewhere - says Mrs. Anna .

&gt;Jacek Bozek , head of Klub Gaja , already passed the matter to lawyers cooperating with the organization . Next week, environmentalists submit to the prosecution notice of a possible crime . God advises that there are situations where youth are taught by people for whom the profit , not the welfare of the animals.

&gt;- This offer creates the possibility of massive fraud - says Bozek . No wonder it outrage people, but points out that , unfortunately, other animals do not have such luck .

&gt;- Dogs and cats are closer to our hearts . Sorry, but if someone wants to buy up pigs, cows or horses who cares little , hardly anyone wants to lift a finger - adds ecologist .

Or maybe Russia will just circumvent that problem by secretly arming pro-Russian Crimeans and have them do the dirty work, without Russia needing to take the risk of an actual military intervention and potential blowback from the West. 

Edit: The Ukrainian parliament just voted to ask the signers of the Budapest memorandum to fulfill the treaty obligations. In this case that means that the US and UK are obliged to defend Ukraine from aggression. It will be very interesting to see what happens next... If the Russian military is actively involved in the aggressive takeover of Ukrainian territory, then this has the potential to escalate enormously.

Even so we can still choose to have a high degree of devolution internally (which has a solid base in the EU due to the subsidiarity principle). We do need to present a united front to the rest of the world though, at least until the big states elsewhere have crumbled.

Mostly because Russia is the only threat to Sweden militarily and they are viewed as bullies by a lot of Swedes thanks to the history we have.

It is a tricky relation though because they also appreciate that Russia is a country that has historically challenged the US though and other things, also Russia isn't the best of pals with the EU, and nationalists dislike EU.

I think in Ukraines case it's pretty clear that the far right movement in the Ukrainian opposition (or former opposition) is very big and it has a long history, predating WWll.

Debatable. 


Romania along with most of the countries of that ""half of Europe"" weren't occupied by the soviets a generation ago. 

And Ceausescu was not a russian puppet. His actions - especially not invading Czechoslovakia - and his relations with the west also say that about him. If he did that ""to fool"" the west into thinking that he wasn't a puppet or not, is debatable.

True, Italy has the third ""non-elected"" PM in a row. Italy isn't on the verge of a civil war though. And non of these PMs have decided on a drastic change of direction like leaving the Euro or leaving Nato, for example.

That, however, is at stake in the Ukraine. I don't believe that the pro-Russian part of the country is fairly represented in the current government. If the pro-Western forces were to use the non-elected government to decide such fundamental issues, that would sow the seed for future conflicts when resentments rise again, as they undoubtedly will. And the EU would be blamed for any such future conflicts.

Anyways, why are the pro-Western forces in such a hurry to create a *fait accompli*? Waiting one month or waiting two months doesn't make a great difference.

Ukraine and Russia both have modern armies, they both have modern and ""western"" like society, this wont be like afghanistan where russia fights vs some insurgents in a cave for 10 years. Whatever happens in Ukraine if Russia wants to do something is that it will be over fast as hell, and Russia will succeed. 

i bet Russia has learned from history, they would only want territories where Russians live, because the local population wouldnt feel oppressed and they might even like being part of Russia, its a secure investment, not like the soviet expansion.

anyhow, if Ukraine and Russia play this smart very little bloodshed will be had, Russia gets part of south east Ukraine, Ukraine gets rid of their Russian opposition.

C'est évidement bobo de considérer que *les gens* vont à IKEA, et cela témoigne d'une méconnaissance de la France, [caractéristique des élites](http://www.lagazettedescommunes.com/213826/les-elites-sont-obnubilees-par-les-metropoles-christophe-guilluy-geographe/) ( je remets le même lien car si tu l'avais lu tu n'aurais pas insisté).

&gt;ces deux enseignes se distinguent notamment par leur implantation très forte dans les zones périurbaines que tu vois comme réservoir de voix du FN...

... Donc tu n'as absolument pas compris ce dont il s'agit. C'est exactement l'inverse. IKEA est justement uniquement implanté dans les zones qui profitent de la mondialisation, mais qui ne représentent que 40% de la population.

&gt;Tu peux bien te plaindre des fermetures d'usines, mais force est de constater que le peuple, quand il s'agit de voter avec leur portefeuille, vote pour la mondialisation.

... Non. Ton raisonnement occulte 60% de la population. Avant de voter avec son portefeuille, il faut avoir quelque chose dans son portefeuille.

La colle tient car il y a un projet commun pour la France. La politique extérieure est la même : indépendance de la France.

Of course, American governments don't have gas chambers (although they do commit war crimes, and [that's coming from an American)](http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2013/08/26/syria-another-western-war-crime-in-the-making-paul-craig-roberts/).

In fact, the US have passed through phases of great liberty, and great oppression (ex: McCarthyism)

De Gaulle himself was grateful for the Americans' opposition to the Soviets, but warned that an American hegemony over the world would be as dangerous as a Soviet one if not even worse; he was vouching for a balance of power. 

Here's a quote from Mitterrand, the longest standing French president (14 years), not long before his death: 

""France doesn't know it, but we're at war with America. Yes, a permanent war, a vital war, an economic war, a war without deaths apparently. Yes, Americans are very though, they're voracious, they want power uncontested over the world. It's an *unknown* war, a permanent war, without deaths apparently but apparently a war to the death.""

And indeed, De Gaulle was right, as Americans are not stupid like the Soviets, they aren't sending tanks within their own sphere of influence.

The British demanded that the EU support them in their war, even though the EU is not a military alliance. 

The Spanish and Italians were much more sympathetic towards Argentina. The French were sort of in between.

And the Germans, who had lost about a third of their national territory after WWII, couldn't understand why in this day and age a country could go to war because of rock on the other side of the planet. To them it seemed like a relic of the colonial past.

Publicly, the US didn't take sides because they didn't want to sour their relations with South America, but secretly they provided substantial material and intelligence support to the UK.

Half a league, half a league,

Half a league onward,

All in the valley of Death,

Charge for the guns' he said:

Into the valley of Death

Rode the six hundred.

    Some one had blunder'd:
    Theirs not to make reply,
    Theirs not to reason why,
    Theirs but to do and die:
    Into the valley of Death
    Rode the six hundred.

Cannon to right of them,

Cannon to left of them,

Cannon in front of them

Volley'd and thunder'd;

Storm'd at with shot and shell,

Boldly they rode and well,

Into the jaws of Death,

Into the mouth of Hell

Rode the six hundred.


    Flash'd all their sabres bare,
    Flash'd as they turned in air
    Sabring the gunners there,
    Charging an army while
    All the world wonder'd:
    Plunged in the battery-smoke
    Right thro' the line they broke;
    Cossack and Russian
    Reel'd from the sabre-stroke
    Shatter'd and sunder'd.
    Then they rode back, but not
    Not the six hundred.

Cannon to right of them,

Cannon to left of them,

Cannon behind them

Volley'd and thunder'd;

Storm'd at with shot and shell,

While horse and hero fell,

They that had fought so well

Came thro' the jaws of Death,

Back from the mouth of Hell,

All that was left of them,

Left of six hundred.

    When can their glory fade?
    O the wild charge they made!
    All the world wonder'd.

That is not correct. Internationally, there was more sympathy for Argentina than there is for the pro-Russian camp in the Ukraine today. Most of the Latin world, especially Spain and other Spanish speaking countries, but also Italy, etc. had sympathies for Argentina. Even though the Argentine case was hopeless due to the military junta.

Today, most in the West only consider Western media and disregard Russian reporting of events. Even though there is a lot of manipulation and rumors distorting Western reporting, almost nobody is willing to admit this.

3. Some soldiers spotted having nightvision gear and grenade launchers attached to their guns

4. Some reports from yesterday indicate the soldiers speak Russian, today they are completely silent

5. ALL insignia are removed from clothing, trucks and APC's. That's some damn dedication by a hastily formed militia

6. All soldiers act professionally and the same, news reports say they  carry themselves as actual soldiers. This suggest these are trained, and not random citizens.

**DO NOT:**

1. Don't be loud. 
2. Don't stare at people on the metro. 
3. Don't get upset when you ask for your steak to be ""bien cuit"" (well done) and they tell you no. The customer is not always right here, and you're actually better off for it (at least at restaurants)
4. Don't stop driving through an intersection when it changes yellow. The people behind you will honk. They expect you to fill the gap. Yes it's weird, but that's how it's done here. 
5. Don't buy the little tiny Eiffel Towers from the people at the tower, or anywhere else. Don't let them put bracelets on you. 
6. Also, don't sign anything at the tower or at trocadero to help the orphans or whatever it is. 

**DO**

1. Do say hello when you enter a shop. These places are an extension of the owners home, and they appreciate the politeness. Some will consider it rude if you just walk in and start looking around without acknowledging them with a hello. 
2. Do watch your pockets at the tourists places. Sometimes they will bump into you or hide their sneaky hand with a map in your face. Just give them some distance.

All along the conflict we have had very aggressive Western moves destined to take over the Ukraine and eventually move Nato forces right up to the Russian border. What would the US do if the Russians sponsored a regime-change in Canada and move its forces to the US/Canadian border? All hell would break lose. 

Considering this, the Russian response has been very moderate. The Russians don't want a civil war on their doorstep, they don't want an invasion of the Ukraine. And only a few weeks ago Putin was in Brussels to propose closer economic relations between Russia and the EU. The Russians suffered a serious setback with Yanukovych's failure. But that doesn't change the fact that there is a substantial pro-Russian population in the Ukraine and economically both highly intertwined.

You don't hit a guy when he is down. The West is unnecessarily provocative. Do Western war mongers really think it is a good idea to risk a military confrontation over the Ukraine?

Il-y-a un IKEA à [Hénin-Beaumont](http://www.ikea.com/fr/fr/store/henin_beaumont/), un autre à [Vitrolles](http://www.ikea.com/fr/fr/store/marseille/), et un autre à [Toulon](http://www.ikea.com/fr/fr/store/toulon/). Tiens, ces noms-là me sont familiers...

Et ""près"" des villes, c'est tout relatif. L'IKEA ""Paris Ouest"", par exemple, est à Plaisir, à 40 km de route de Paris et, j'en suis certain, pas une grande métropole...tu ne peux pas compter les périurbains dans le 60% de la population qui ""vit en dehors des grandes métropoles"", puis tenter d'ignorer que pratiquement tous ces gros magasins sont, justement, en zone périurbaine.

Et finalement, tu peux garder tes ""ad hominem"" sur ""les élites"" pour toi.

true,GolemGorgor,ZZZZZZcamembert,Camembert,"J'ai eu la chance d'aller au théâtre des Champs Élysées pour assister à un concert classique. Au programme :  

 * [Fantaisie pour violon en ut majeur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wbwnMFvwqo) de Schumann, c'est vraiment magnifique, je ne peux que vous recommander de l'écouter ;  
 * Michigan trio de Manoury, là je suis resté assez neutre, je ne sais pas vraiment quoi dire. Je n'ai pas un connaisseur mais je ne comprends pas la démarche du compositeur ici, je ne sais pas ce qu'il cherchait et je ne sais pas ce que je peux y trouver en tant que spectateur ignare ;  
 * [Concerto pour violon en ré mineur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLod6Ra6f08) de Schumann, j'ai beacoup apprécié le premier mouvement, la suite un peu moins ;  
 * [Symphonie n°1 «Le Printemps» en si bémol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m239buRzHPg), encore de Schumann. Je ne suis pas fan du printemps de Vivaldi, mais celui-ci je vous conseille fortement de l'écouter.  
C'est stupide à dire tellement c'est évident, mais c'est fou ce que ça change d'écouter ça en ""vrai"", face à un orchestre. Le son est incomparable, on a l'impression qu'il y a un vrai volume et surtout on entend vraiment bien mieux les différents instruments. Ah, j'allais oublier, l'orchestre était l'Orchestre de chambre de Paris, dirigé par Thomas Zehetmair. Je m'attendais d'ailleurs à ce qu'il n'y ait que 4 ou 5 musiciens sur scène, j'ai confondu orchestre de chambre avec musique de chambre.  

Transition douce vers la partie plus brute, celle où je balance toutes les musiques qui m'ont bien plu cette semaine :  

 * On continue un peu dans le ""classique"" avec le [Concerto pour violon en si mineur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF9zI33Oass) de Dvorák. Je pense que c'est le compositeur que je préfère, et pas que pour sa [barbe](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Dvorak1.jpg) ;
 * Allez, on change de style avec [God save your soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIspXBkmdEg) du groupe Sycamore. Encore un morceau bien tranquille, histoire de ne pas trop m'éloigner de ce que j'avais pu poster la semaine dernière ;
 * [Zimbabwe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXCogIF4aX4) d'Alex Kunda, un peu plus énergique déjà, je vous laisse l'écouter ;
 * [The Invader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UBmKPuyXkc) du groupe The Space Walkers, toujours avec du synthé et de la guitare électrique ;
 * [No place for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omONI3nONsw) de The Baby Ruth, vous pouvez télécharger leur album gratuitement sur [leur bandcamp](http://thebabyruth.bandcamp.com/), je dois avouer que je ne l'ai pas encore écouté ;
 * [Bad boy turns good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PorrnnvJyOk) du groupe Fresh Blueberry Pancake, morceau aussi rafraichissant que le nom de leur groupe ;
 * [To harvest the storm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1lQQZBaIlQ) de Landskap, tout en douceur, simple mais efficace, le morceau dure un peu moins de 12 minutes mais c'est bien trop court. Leur album est également disponible gratuitement sur [leur bandcamp](http://landskap.bandcamp.com/), il est cependant un cran en dessous de ce morceau.  

Je vais terminer, rapidement je l'espère, par les films que j'ai vus cette semaine :
  
 * [Confessions d'un homme dangereux](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0270288/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) de, et avec, George Clooney et également avec Drew Barrymore et Sam Rockwell. J'ai plutôt bien apprécié ce film et j'ai réussi à apprécier Clooney dans un autre film que [Burn After Reading](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887883/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (que je vous conseille fortement également). Le film est assez bon, et surtout il y a Sam Rockwell (qui joue également dans le très bon [Moon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)) que j'aime beaucoup en tant qu'acteur, le ton du film est globalement assez léger ;
 * [Detective Dee: Le mystère de la flamme fantôme](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1123373/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) qui nous vient droit de Chine. Il possède un côté assez délirant avec des scènes de combats un peu du style de [Tigre et dragon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190332/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), des effets spéciaux parfois un peu moyen et une enquête policière au sein de je ne sais pas quelle époque de la Chine. Je l'ai bien apprécié, lui aussi est assez léger mais j'ai eu l'impression que la fin était un peu longue à arriver.  

Pendant que j'y pense, quelqu'un a-t-il lu Solaris ? Je n'ai pas particulièrement apprécié le film mais j'ai eu l'impression qu'on pouvait faire quelque chose de mieux avec.

It is not unlikely that this is Russia's way of showing some muscle, so that Ukraine's new government declares it will honor the agreements surrounding the naval base. And Russia is completely able and willing to invade a country to make a point, as we saw in Georgia. They know Europe or the US will not intervene militarily.

&gt;Arms need to be handed over, armed gunmen need to leave the streets and buildings and squares “unblocked”.

&gt;He says the west “connived with the EuroMaidan forces” and must bear responsibility for what has happened there.

&gt;He’s now stopped speaking but is taking questions.
&gt;Yanukovych begins by saying it is high time for him to announce his decision “to fight for the future of Ukraine against those who use fear and power”.

&gt;He says he was forced to leave Ukraine because of the threat to his life and his relatives’ life.

&gt;Ukraine has been taken over by fascists, representing a minority of the Ukrainian people, he says.

What would the consequence for the economy be if all these houses were nationalized? If everyone who had nothing would just be given one? The value of houses would plummet massively. 

But most people have mortgages on their house. They would be forced to pay a loan for something that had gone down in value drastically. Those who own a second house for vacation, to rent out or just as an inheritance, would lose a very large chunk of what is basically their pension savings. 

You cannot fix a social problem by destroying the economy. Because that's how we can afford to pay for social policy. 

Most homeless people have issues. Debt, mental problems, health problems,... they need treatment and assistance. They need to be re-integrated into society, get a job, have real relationships.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; Over a year after the rejection of the EU Constitution by French and Dutch
&gt; voters, the EU remains directionless. This is in large part a result of France’s
&gt; abrogation of its leadership role in the EU. France is now the principal roadblock
&gt; to reform in the EU. France is more and more openly unwilling to accept the
&gt; culture of co-operation and fair-play upon which the EU relies or to uphold the
&gt; legal obligations that bind its membership of the EU.
&gt; •
&gt; French rejection of the spirit of Community co-operation can be seen across
&gt; many areas of its dealings with the EU:
&gt; • France repeatedly fails to transpose EU directives into French law.
&gt; • France shows a strong reluctance to implement EU laws and ignores the
&gt; threat of sanctions.
&gt; • French high-handedness undermines the authority of the EU institutions.
&gt; • France is systematically undermining the four economic freedoms that
&gt; underpin the operation of the single market.
&gt; •
&gt; This behaviour by the French government has far-reaching consequences:
&gt; • It destroys the level legal playing
&gt; fi
&gt; eld upon which European co-operation relies.
&gt; • It undermines the authority of the EU and sends the message to new member
&gt; states that they do not have to ful
&gt; fi
&gt; l their treaty obligations.
&gt; • It damages the operation of the single market and makes vital economic
&gt; reform impossible.
&gt; • It creates distrust between member states that undermines the spirit of
&gt; co-operation vital to stability in Europe

However, if we go by your definition of just sympathizing with them, then I can agree on there probably being hundreds of thousands, but in that case it is only dangerous if there's enough of them to get a parliamentarian majority.

&gt;

&gt;**Honour** (also **honor** in [American English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#-our.2C_-or); from the [Latin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language) word honor) is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or corporate body such as a [family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family), [school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School), [regiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment) or [nation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation). Accordingly, [individuals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual) (or corporate bodies) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific [code of honour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honour_code), and the moral code of the [society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society) at large.

&gt;Honour can be viewed in the light of [Psychological nativism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_nativism) as being as real to the [human condition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition) as [love](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love), and likewise deriving from the formative personal bonds that establish one's personal [dignity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity) and [character](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_character). From the point of [moral relativism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism), honour is perceived as arising from universal concerns for material circumstance and status, rather than fundamental differences in principle between those who hold different honour codes.

&gt;[Dr Samuel Johnson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Johnson), in his A Dictionary of the English Language (1755), defined honour as having several senses, the first of which was ""nobility of soul, magnanimity, and a scorn of meanness."" This sort of honour derives from the perceived [virtuous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue) conduct and personal integrity of the person endowed with it. On the other hand, Johnson also defined honour in relationship to ""[reputation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation)"" and ""[fame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity)""; to ""privileges of rank or birth"", and as ""respect"" of the kind which ""places an individual socially and determines his right to precedence."" This sort of honour is not so much a function of moral or ethical excellence, as it is a consequence of power. Finally, with respect to [sexuality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexuality), honour has traditionally been associated with (or identical to) ""[chastity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chastity)"" or ""[virginity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginity)"", or in case of married men and women, ""[fidelity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity)"". Some have argued that honour should be seen more as a rhetoric, or set of possible actions, than as a code.

Its not a problem endemic to the ukraine, and its not new either. Many former soviet countries suffer from this shit, especially russia itself.

Those movements are usually ""supported"" by one faction or the other to push their goals. Putin has fostered (or catalyzed, depending on perspective) the russian nazis to promote a strong russia sentiment. (Count the days till that specter bites him in the ass again...)

Que ce soit dans la vraie vie ou sur le web, je me fais incendier à chaque fois que j'explique avoir été déçu par un Tarantino. Ca ne m'est jamais arrivé pour aucun autre film et ce refus très fréquent de tolérer un avis dissident m'interpelle. Ca me laisse penser que Tarantino flatte son public et que donc tout avis différent devient in fine une critique du spectateur lui-même.

Je ne déteste pas ses films, mais je ne les aime pas spécialement. 

Les sujets abordés sont trop faciles (des Nazis et des esclavagistes, pourquoi pas une nana qui part à la chasse aux pédophiles cannibales dans un prochain film) et le choix de la musique ""décalée"" est plus que contestable.

Le poncif qui veut que tous les méchants soient toujours ultra charismatiques et celui d'alterner entre scènes de baston et scènes de vie quotidienne m'avaient fait leur effet dans Reservoir Dogs, mais depuis ils sont tous deux usés jusqu'à la corde.

Tarantino est maître dans l'art de faire des films de série B (qui sont je le rappelle ses principales sources d'inspiration, il l'avoue lui-même) tout en flattant le public en lui faisant croire qu'ils voient un grand film se faisant ironiquement pour un film de série B.

And since when would you like to know? It's really, really complex, cause all depends on what level you'd like to see it. One of most recent events on a plane of economy was Poland pushing for European energy policy and making EU more independent of Russian gas and natural resources (ie. next to UK Poland is most active in trying to get the shale gas extraction). On more military-related topics: Georgia and (failed) Anti-missile shield come first into my mind.

Let the people decide that in plebiscites. It's pretty obvious that in Crimea most people would likely vote to join with Russia or to form a new state, and some other parts of eastern Ukraine might go along the same lines. If it prevents full-blown civil war, it would be worth it. 

Again, it's important to remember that the present borders were drawn-up during Soviet Era.  From 1793 to 1954 Crimea was part of Russia, not Ukraine.  Also, how those ethnic Russians got there is largely beside the point (mostly by displacing Tatars, for the record) regarding the present crisis, as those people aren't going anywhere, and they have a right to determine their own future.  So long as rights of minorities are protected (at least in law to begin with) then a fracturing of Ukraine is unfortunately probably region's best option.   After all, people have a right to self-determination, don't they?
