Même à coup de 8h/jour, c'est un peu léger 6 mois pour décrocher un taf dans le milieu en tant que dev. Et surtout il faut avoir la motiv' pour y arriver tout seul ! 

Les tutos c'est bien beau, mais pour bien maitriser son sujet rien ne vaut un bouquin (O'reilly par ex) qui explore le sujet à 100%. Sans cet approfondissement, on se retrouve à faire des trucs qui fonctionnent juste parce qu'on a suivi un tuto, et dès que l'on touche à une ligne plus rien ne marche et on ne comprend pas.

Après pour les langages, je suis pas sûr que node.js ça rapporte du taf, autour de moi (en province) c'est plutôt php/mysql. 

Tout ce mouvement de framework js, ça me fait penser à ROR à l'époque, tout le monde voulait s'y mettre et ne jurait que par ça, mais au final ce qui rapportait des projets et de la thune c'étaient les languages ""chiants"" (php, java).

Sinon, rien ne vaut l'école à mon avis, cela permet d'avoir des bases dans des domaines liés auxquels on pense pas vraiment (typographie, image, écriture, scénarisation, algo etc) et qui sont super utiles dans le milieu même si on est juste dev (pour mieux communiquer avec les designer et les intégrateurs).

  Les DUT sérécoms sont remplis de gens passionnés, même si le côté geek pas trop ouvert sur le monde  peut saouler parfois, on est bien encadré  et on a vraiment un sentiment d'appartenance. Si on veut, on peut continuer jusqu'en M2 voire doctorat dans certains IUT (shout out pour ma formation à Montbéliard), sinon y'a des écoles d'ingé mais je peux pas commenter dessus.

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"It won't survive. There are no core values to the European Union left, only capital is valued. The Union is growing more decadent and rests solely on the political whims and greed of the North, which dictates all policy. These are now interested in a two-tiered EU, for the sake of personal profit and clearly not thinking long term. The currency is an absolute disgrace and a suckers trap, designed by financial tricksters to gangrene countries much like a pyramid scheme. This will only be made irrelevant because the world economy will soon grind to a halt or collapse spectacularly. There is such a thing as non-negotiable natural  limits and we can't keep borrowing from the future. When we realize there are no futures capable of sustaining this worldwide ecofootprint and social asymmetry, it'll all crumble.

Also, we have no good leaders, or charismatic and uncompromised/untainted leaders by party favorings/sponsorships/lobbies. Frankly, the system can only output these mediocre puppets and the people have lost the ability to elect good leaders or choose objectively. It's not just the system that has become a corruption swamp, the people themselves are apathetic and mediocre by design. This is because Banks and Corporations hold too much power over government. And we're no ""great generation"". We know it deep within and still do nothing. Becoming cynics at best. 

We had it easy and now it decays as it always does in evolved societies. But this is a global phenomenon and a result of our global societal model. As long as we are defined by selfishness and how much we consume or own... we'll get mediocre leadership along with it, or else growth stops and the economy tanks. 

Peripheral countries will eventually secede or be made irrelevant because there won't be a solution, only a prolonged agony. And it will be bad. Much worse than now. The growing sovereign debt is unmanageable, for all countries. 

Russia won't have it easy also. It's too big of a prize for a resource and ""lebensraum"" starving Southeast Asia. The US will weather this by feeding off the European carcass.

* I came expecting Juncker vs. Schulz, ended up with Schulz vs. Verhofstadt. Was not disappointed. Schulz was great, Verhofstadt was awesome. You have to give it to them, their back and forth was the highlight of the debate. They were engaging, fun and had great points to share. More.

* Kudos to Ska Keller, I honestly expected her to be swallowed by the other three more experienced candidates, but she held her ground (yes, I agree, a bit naïve and 'flower-power' sometimes, but what do you expect) and even got her few moments to shine. Didn't bite as much as she could have when the questions went to dependency on foreign gas/oil, hopefully this will get corrected in the next debate.

* I found kind of refreshing hear Juncker refer to the EU as a soft power and explain the limitations of it. Also kind of supported gay rights! Yes, Keller and Verhofstadt quickly went out of their way to point the hypocresy of the People's Party on that subject, but I'm going to applaud Juncker for separating himself from his more conservative colleagues... that said he could've stayed at home and we wouldn't have lost much.

* It was a debate, so I shouldn't even get bothered by this but... oh, man, sometimes one of the candidates would suddenly go on a very interesting tirade and the moderators would just jump in and move on to the next candidate or the next topic.",0,1398745876,null,0,false,0,ch4swbx,t3_247ir6,t1_ch4swbx,t3_247ir6,null,1433568731,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"I understand you are saying the US is starting off at a higher point, so socialism would be more easily workable. But there is something to be said about profit motive. During Soviet times, there was a Norwegian logging company that never cut down a tree. All it did is dredge a river and harvest logs that sunk from the Soviet inefficient logging method. Dont confuse this critique of this one instance with me comparing what you're saying to the entire Soviet Union, I'm not. But if you look at the micro level you see instances of incredible waste by state owned companies in closed markets. 

You could bring up state owned companies today, but they typically have to compete with market players, and have to be efficient to stay solvent. You can look to China for examples. Their state owned entities consume the strong majority of the country's capital but only produce 1/3 of the output. They're less efficient, which is part of the reason China is so protectionist about its internal market. If exposed to efficient outside companies, their state owned enterprises would require even more state funding than they do now. 

[This instance in Maoist China](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/01/20/145360447/the-secret-document-that-transformed-china) illustrates why people respond to an incentive. In this case it was not money, but rather, to work hard so they could eat. 

You bring up ""workplace democracy."" I think it is a really cool concept, and there are companies utilizing it now. But the difference is the employees have an incentive to make the company profitable. These companies almost always (dare I say always) have a profit sharing plan. The profit motive is what motivates them to make sound decisions for the company.

I see what you're saying when you say capitalism enslaved billions to develop society. But I dont see other systems that dont do the same. I dont dispute the fact that most capitalist societies are originally built with cheap labor. But I do think capitalism is the fastest way to get people out of poverty. If you look at Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and now China, they all followed the model of ""exports first"" that China is now following. This, almost by definition, will rely in cheap manual labor. But look at where they started and how far they came in only a few decades. It is absolutely incredible. I would make the argument that workers are voting with their feet by moving to cities during these capitalist movements. Even if they are being exploited by Western standards, they would not continue migrating to cities if life there was worse than sustenance farming. I have been in several countries where people rely on sustenance farming. They're often extremely malnourished, sickly, and live in horrific conditions by Western standards. Although I will be the first to say the exploitative state plays a partial role in that. 

I would like to make one last point. You mention the quality of life in Cuba, but every year many many Cubans risk their life, often using no more than a piece of wood or makeshift boat, to get to Florida. Cuba may be doing socialism right, but many people clearly dont prefer that system to the system in the US. In fact, unless they're a fugitive, I would bet virtually no Americans make the opposite trip. 

Also, dont you think perfect equality significantly stifles talent. If a person has a great idea, but gets no benefit from working hard to see it come to fruition, it seems like that person's talents would be greatly wasted. Immigrants come to the US and start businesses in higher proportions than native born Americans. So its clear some people are unhappy with the business climate at home, and prefer the one in the US. Dont you think these people would always feel disenfranchised in the system you describe, and therefore, would cause unrest?

Dont you think these people would always feel disenfranchised in the system you describe, and therefore, would cause unrest?

No. If you look at the fields which bring out the most in raw talent - the arts, sciences, creative endeavours - none of these fields depend on a profit motive instilled in the workers. The vast majority of workers employed in these fields get a kick out of fulfilling their endeavours to the best of their ability, rather than making bank. If you look at it in the context of a communist utopia, you must remember that there is no money. 

The people born into this society have no concept of money as a reward. They are not associated with the idea of a reward being equal to another reward. This is part of the problem with money: the workers in a commune work for the good of society. There are no ""moochers"": every able person is allowed to pursue their interest. Let's be real, no one is going to want to sit around and do nothing, make no money, and live a relatively subsistence-level life whilst everyone else is doing great things. They are motivated purely by having natural desires, rather than having a separate influence (the need to make money to survive) interfering with that.

If they have a great idea, they are able to pursue that. 

Regarding immigration to the US: again, look at it in a broader context rather than blurring lines between ideologies and actual countries.

Pretty much every country that these immigrants are from are going to be significantly worse-off than America, right? Of course. Much of the success of the US and the West came off the backs of the ancestors of these immigrants, but that's another topic that isn't especially relevant to this specific topic.

America presents a broader scope of opportunity than the home countries of these people. Again, these countries have almost all emerged from literal subsistence life, where a bad season could be the death of a person. They are engaged in survival, rather than living as humans in a developed society. Compare this with capitalism. You have much economic growth, some opportunity for a job, able to earn keep for oneself, et cetera. Better conditions overall. 

Remember that Cuban immigrants are not comparing the system in Cuba with that in the US, for example, but rather the opportunity that they perceive to exist. Many of those immigrants will end up having to work extreme hours for an average wage, and experience only minor upgrades in overall quality of life. They will, most likely, become a part of the American bottom 30% or so, and only a select few will experience the ""American Dream"", for various reasons. Not all of these people are going to have it a lot better, especially when you consider the level of support that the US gives to poor people (not much, esp. compared to Cuba).

Again, Capitalism is a fantastic upgrade for everyone except the bourgeois (who lose some of their influence, while retaining much of it). It's a much better way to live and develop in the years from farming to modern society.

Don't confuse this with, for example, a Socialist United States. Socialism implemented there would be an upgrade for everyone there, except the 5-1%. The wealth (means of production, factories, etc.) that those people do not need, and have utilised to oppress all of the workers, are given to the workers. Although it may sound unfair, you *must* look at this from the perspective of a worker. They spend all of their day working menial jobs that do not benefit society, in order for capitalists to indulge. This is not the fault of this worker. They were born into this system and have no opportunity to better their life.

It's really important to make the distinction between and ideology and actual countries. This is why referencing things like Holodomor when talking about the good and bad of Communism is an academic crime. Would you not find it ridiculous to make critique of Capitalism by referencing events such as the genocides in the Belgian Congo, the Trail of Tears, and more? Capitalists are responsible for those things, but you won't hear any Socialist or Communist use it as an example of why the USA is bad.

That's the view of your typical socialist / communist. Don't try to contrast it with what pre-existing views, just evaluate it on a purely academic level. It's incredibly difficult to come up with coherent responses to socialists and communists (not bagging on your comments, just giving general advice to anyone reading this) by looking through the capitalist lens. It won't make sense, because we live in capitalism and have been taught that socialism and communism is totalitarian dictatorship and killed 100 millions people (all verifiably untrue).

I personally dont agree with the notion that people's drive would remain unabated if you removed the incentive. I posted an example of the Chinese farmers above. You brought up artists, etc. You are right, much of their fulfillment comes from self achievement. I am not sure a company like Tesla or Google could be founded and ran by a collective. Not only could a founder with a strong vision not found the company in the society you're describing, but he or she could not could not exert any more influence than an assembly line worker that might not have experience directing a high tech startup. 

So in that sense I disagree. Entrepreneurs would not be able to run a company if every decision was put to a popular vote.

true,atlasing,ANAR,le flag waver face,"Not every decision must be put to a popular vote though, that is the beauty of this kind of democracy. The workers may elect a leader in whom they trust, and give him a term of 5 years if they like. Then, the leader can be evaluated and voted on again by the workers.

This is the great thing about it. Since the cooperatives are independent of the government (another common misconception - obviously regulations are decided by the workers via democracy at elections) there's no set system on how they must operate. One factory might like deciding things together, and one programming company might prefer electing a competent leader who has proven their trust to them.

Another thing to consider - why do you question the desire to improve things? If there is a clear opportunity to be had, a worker is allowed to start their own cooperative and lead that themselves. Since there is no need for workers to leave their current job (there is no oppression - workers decide where they want to work purely out of interest), only workers who truly trust in this entrepreneur decide to work for her. The company is run, owned and operated on the basis of voluntary existence.

Don't fall into the trap of thinking that there or no incentives - if a worker is at his job and finds a new tree while surveying, he can start up a new cooperative and plant 100 of these trees if he likes. If it benefits the commune, it will attract workers and suddenly 10 apples per tree are being produced rather than 3, and everyone benefits.

Now substitute money into that equation. In the current system, would you not start the new apple farm purely on incentive benefit?

The government and the authorities can be very far away in the US, partly because of the size of the country, partly because the USA were build on the idea that the people care from the themselves - after all the country was build by adventurous settlers - and that the government should interfere as little possible. So naturally US citizens tend to take (safety) matters into their own hands, and they fiercely defend that freedom. 

And that's okay. It's the same in Canada, Australia and maybe parts of Scandinavia as well. But because of their weak social systems, the ineffective educational system and the fucked up penal system they suffer from (almost) runaway crime rates and have created a serious threat scenario, and many people think that having a gun is the only answer to that. Which might even be true. I don't think you can blame the single US-citizen for having a gun. The gun laws are not the problem. The social instability is, and the solution cannot start with stricter gun laws, it has to start with better social systems and a better penal system, that does more for integrating people into society rather than satisfying the urge for justice and punishment.

I think the real problem of many US-citizens is that they have no sense for the bigger picture. They care only about what is happening inside the fences of their property, which is understandable given the mindset that was passed on them over decades and centuries. They don't see how a proper health-care system would improve their society. They only see the ""attack on their personal freedom - and their loan checks"". They don't care what happens to criminals as long as it happens far away from away. But they don't realize that when all citizens think that way, criminals have no chance to return to an ordered life and likely remain criminals. And they don't care, if the kids in the neighborhood receive a proper education (which they might have to pay more taxes for), ignoring that people who don't receive proper education are more likely to live in poverty and maybe even crime.

I sometimes wonder how many US-Americans really believe that ""bad people"" were already born as bad people. I think I don't want to hear the answer.

However, the next time you look at your loan check and see, how much money ""Vater Staat"" has taken from you, remember what the money is used for: Strong social systems, health-care and proper education for everyone, thus making life better, easier and safer for everyone, including you. Yeah, I know, a very socialist thing to say, but some features of ""socialism"" actually make sense and are healthier than the ""everybody on his own, and don't fuck with my loan checks!""-kind of freedom many US-Americans seem to dream of.

Oh, and the icing on the cake: Many US-Americans seem to have a strange relationship with gun-ownership and gun-usage. Take Michael Kaarma as example: He thought it was okay to set up a trap in his garage to catch a thief, shot a guy, who probably just wanted to help (or take the wallet, but a trap is a trap) and then hide behind the ""castle doctrine"", that allows people in that state to shot trespassers on their property. Michael Kaarma is of course not you average US gun-owner, but I'm sure that there are millions of US-Americans who think, that Michael Kaarma did nothing wrong and that charging him with murder would be an attack on the personal freedom of US-citizens.",0,1398751357,null,0,false,0,ch4uohn,t3_247c77,t1_ch4uohn,t1_ch4b3es,null,1433569571,10,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,10

The Nazi movement (and its predecessor Fascist) are very influenced by Socialism. But they emerged specifically to counter the growing threat of Socialism. The main enemey of Fascists were Socialists. Once in power Fascists supported all right wing sectors of their country- the nobility and land owners, big business, the church, nationalist societies, the army. 

Compare this to when Socialists come in power- the nobility is killed, big business is nationalized, church is often outlawed.

The concept of big government is left wing is a modern concept. It is in the 1970's and the growth of neo-liberalism that we started viewing a smaller government as a tennant as being right wing, it wasnt always the case. And the size of government is not the only way to judge left/right wing. For example Anarchists who are the furthest left dont want any government atall!

So yes, left/right wing spectrum is wrong. But it is very hard to argue that Nazis are left wing just because they wanted big government, once in power the Nazis supported all conservative right wing elements of society, while on the other hand they attacked Socialists and left wing elements. Finally, its only recently that this concept of big government is viewed as left wing, it wasnt always the case.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Note I'm not a supporter of criminilization but there are rational arguments. 

It goes like this- 

1. Large majority of prostitutes are victims. There are maybe some people, lets say 5% who actually enjoy to give their body for money, but those who support criminalization believe that those who are in prostitution were somehow forced into it. They are often comming from a situation of abusive parents, where raped as children, are illegal immigrants, where drug addicts etc. Now while this is true, alot of prostitutes dont like themselves being seen as ""helpless"" victims. Many say they know what they are doing, and they support laws protecting their safety, but not criminilization. 

2. Criminilizing prostitution reduces the amount of people who go look for it. Studies show that where prostitution is illegal, less people end up resorting to it which results in less prostitutes

So for those who support criminilization, the argument is that there are less prostitutes on the market, and therefor less victims of prostitution.

Now personally I dont agree with this. I think the government should try to protect prostitutes, instead of banning them. Banning them puts them in the black market, so while there may be less prostitutes, they are less safe AND those who do prostitute are now illegal and often at the hands of the mafia. 

Secondly, wanting affection from another person, even if its paid, is a need every human wants. The government imo should not be there to put a moral code on what is prostitution or not. Going to a club and buying 10 bottles of champagne to impress young girls to come back home with you is OK, a rich old man marrying a super model is ok, a man going to Africa and marrying a girl from an isolated village is OK, but prostitution is not? There is hypocrisy in that and the government should not impose its molarity on us. 

Thirdly, most prostitutes are against banning it. Banning prostitution gives them less customers and makes their jobs more difficult and dangerous. 

For me the solution is protect the prostitutes, dont ban the practice. And most of all, dont be a hypocrite and impose your morality on the rest of society.

And I am worried that Sweden is trying to fight prostitution on moral grounds, rather than righteous grounds. I can understand trying to fight it to help protect women.

It was technically the Communist threat that Nazis grew to oppose, and whom eventually became their main enemy. The SPD were the socialists in Germany and they weren't the ones having near civil war levels of street fights with the Nazis in the 20s. 

There were elements of purging the nobility in the Night of the Long Knives, and it was disillusioned members of the nobility who were noticeably involved in the July 20 Plot. There were members of the nobility who believed Hitler was ruining what Germany used to stand for in the Kaiserreich. 

Also the Nazis weren't pro-religion except for maybe some sort of Neo-Paganism. Bormann was indisputably an early 20th century left wing militant secularist though. 

But I guess beside that I'll agree with you. My views in the previous post focused more on Nazi economic policies.

Hitler even admired Islam, which he considered more ""masculine""- 

&gt; The Mohammedan religion too would have been much more compatible to us than Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?

&gt; Hitler said that the conquering Arabs, because of their racial inferiority, would in the long run have been unable to contend with the harsher climate and conditions of the country. They could not have kept down the more vigorous natives, so that ultimately not Arabs but Islamized Germans could have stood at the head of this Mohammedan Empire.

Some useful quotes:

&gt;Since DPA is sprayed on fruit after it is harvested, USDA tests of apples find it more often and at greater concentrations than most other pesticide residues. (DPA is regulated as a pesticide, but it does not kill insects, weeds or fungal growth.)

&gt;The first DPA-based pesticide chemical was registered with the U.S. government in 1962. The World Health Organization has evaluated the safety of DPA several times since the 1960s, with a particular focus on impurities that could be more toxic than DPA itself. Most recently, WHO said that long-term exposure was “unlikely to present a public health concern” (WHO/FAO 2007). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reviewed the safety of DPA in 1998 and concluded that its use posed no unacceptable risk to people or the environment (EPA 1998). Today, the EPA allows maximum concentrations of DPA of 10 parts per million on apples and 5 parts per million on pears.

&gt;European regulators, to the contrary, ascribe the absence of evidence of harm to poor investigation.  They concluded that the manufacturers of DPA had not provided enough testing to prove that their product and any chemicals formed when it broke down were safe (EFSA 2012).

&gt;Of particular concern to EC officials was the possible presence on DPA-treated fruit of nitrosamines, a family of potent carcinogens. Nitrosamines contaminate food, cosmetics and latex rubber. They cause cancer in laboratory animals, and some studies have found that people eating foods with nitrosamines have elevated rates of stomach and esophageal cancers (NTP 2011). Nitrosamines form when nitrogen-containing compounds combine with amines, which are compounds derived from ammonia. Since the 1970s, government agencies have regulated foods and consumer products to limit concentrations of chemicals that can serve as building blocks of nitrosamines.

&gt;European regulators theorized that nitrosamines could be generated if DPA combined, either during storage or when fruit was processed, with a source of nitrogen, an element ubiquitous in the environment.  They had little hard evidence that this chemical reaction was, in fact, occurring.  Beginning in 2008, they pressed makers of DPA for test data that showed whether nitrosamines or other harmful chemicals formed when containers of DPA sat on shelves, when fruit was treated with DPA and stored for a long time and when DPA-treated fruit was processed into juices, purees and sauces (EFSA 2008).  The industry provided one study that detected three unknown chemicals on DPA-treated apples at concentrations greater than 50 parts per billion, but it could not determine if any of these chemicals, apparently formed when the DPA broke down, were nitrosamines. It did not study whether nitrosamines were being formed on DPA-treated apples made into apple juice or applesauce.

&gt;In 2012 the European Food Safety Authority, a government body that evaluates the risk of pesticides for the European Commission, concluded that the industry had not provided sufficient information and that the many data gaps made it impossible to confirm the safety of DPA (EFSA 2012). The full Commission banned the use of DPA on European apples and pears in June 2012 (EC 2012), and it followed through with a binding regulation, to take effect in March of this year, which reduced the allowable level of DPA on imports to 0.1 part per million (EC 2013).  It  did not set the permissible level of DPA at zero because untreated apples can sometimes acquire traces of DPA when warehoused in storage facilities which have also held DPA-coated apples. The regulators reasoned that people would not be at risk from an amount as small as 0.1 part per million.",0,1398762720,null,0,false,0,ch4wxr8,t3_248vyx,t1_ch4wxr8,t1_ch4vg09,null,1433570704,27,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,27

That sort of thing always made me smirk. I get that the FN would likely shut out regionalism. But you should understand/appreciate the gesture. You're a nationalist, or at least a patriot, for your region, just like the FN people are nationalists, or at least patriots, for the country as a whole. You're the same.

I've never really understood why regionalists in Brittany are so painfully leftists. Corsican regionalists are far-right leaning. That makes sense to me. 

That Bretons regionalists are leftists, that doesn't make sense to me. You're regionalists because you rightfully think you have your own identity and whatnot. Yet you're leftists, so presumably pro-mass-immigration and open borders, with the classic universalism sentiment that we're all part of one humanity and whatever. So why this separatism coupled with universalism? You probably feel regionalism will give more democratic power to you and your region..etc. But what about the EU? Unless you're anti-EU far-left, the EU as an overseeing, ""foreign"" political power is the same as the nation of France. Well actually, France cares more ultimately, as it carries Brittany in its heart considering almost everyone in Paris claims to have Breton origins and Brittany is a beloved/trendy region. Also, with the typical pro-immigration stance the left wing has... Let's just carry the argument a step further. Is there some point, some threshold, when leftist Breton regionalists might consider that immigration should be limited, because at some point, if a threshold of foreigners is reached, Brittany will loose its specificity? And there would thus be no point in considering that it's in any way different than all the neighboring melting-pot regions where people come from all over, where it's all just a huge mix of everything and anything? How would Brittany feel like Brittany, or be different enough to claim regionalism, under a scenario where immigration is so massive that the Bretons in ancestry and culture are relegated to some folklore, and a few untouched villages?

PS : I understand historically why Irish Republicans (who were thus regionalists within the British Empire) were left-leaning. First off, it was back in the day when mass immigration wasn't particularly part of left wing ideology. Also the Irish were actually oppressed by Imperialism, so the left-wing political thought made sense. That's hardly the case for the Bretons nowadays.

&gt;It's frightening how much you've lost touch with reality. A generalization like that is on an otherworldly level.

So you think a dozen people holding more wealth than 3 billion is good?

You think widening inequality is good?

You think exploitation of people is good?

Because that's what Capitalism is. Greed, driven by the incessant need to perpetually increase profit margins. 

&gt;Tell me how the capitalist economic model requires any of that.

Colonialism is a byproduct of Capitalsim, where states invaded and subjugated weaker states in order to exploit them for wealth. 

But that's not what we were talking about. You said this was Communist ideology, when it *factually* is not. It is USSR Imperialist policy.

&gt;I understand what communism is, and I like it in theory, but the world isn't clay that we can mold into an idea that someone forms.

But you don't. You know what Stalinism is, maybe a bit of Leninism and Maoism, because it is those branches of Communism that can possibly lead to dictatorship. The rest of them are designed as ground-up movements which involve either dissolution of the state or extreme decentralization. 

&gt;Point proven. I haven't lived in the Gaza strip, so I won't take a fucking side.

You didn't *prove* anything. All you did is show me that you have no capability for abstract thinking or empathy.

&gt;If you think people are too selfish and power hungry to live well in a capitalist society, how do you think they would do when a control system is put into place, and the only thing keeping the system running is good will and honesty?

Because it isn't just run on good will. It's run by a democracy and constitution. Secondly, when the vast majority of the population is benefiting, there's no reason they would want to compromise it.

There's a distinct difference between living in a society that encourages selfishness and exacerbates greed and one that focuses on community and sharing.

&gt;Also, we already have effective capitalist systems in the world. 

Sure do! And I would nonetheless remove it, because even if the conditions in these Capitalist systems were better than other Capitalist systems, they're still Capitalist and still exploiting the workers. 

&gt;The social-capitalism practiced by the Germans, Swedes, and French for example works well

For who? The homeless? The working class barely scraping by? Those living in the banlieues?

2.Some netizens in Taiwan are saying it's hypocritical because while Germany strives for a nuke-free nation, you guys purchase nuke-powered electricity from France. Is that true?

Yes and no, you can not describe it that way, germany also exports electricity, also Nukes can not be shut down that easy, so you can not say that when the wind in germany is low the french nukes jump on, factually its a continous give and take.

Aiuto a FCA? Nonostante FCA abbia la fetta di mercato più grande in Italia (28/30%), devi guardare a quante automobili della gamma FCA rientrerebbero nei criteri fissati per gli incentivi:

1) Yes, our energy prices have risen - but it's not sure if this can be attributed to becoming nuke free, because Germany at the same time tries to reduce fossil fuel (especially brown coal) as well - and is highly subsidizing solar and wind power - costs, that drive the price for energy as well.

2) Somewhat true. Germany buys and sells energy constantly. AFAIK, europe has connected power grids that are market driven and trade power on short notice. I've visited a power grid control center once - it was very impressive, while I have to admit that I didn't fully understood what exactly they control there.

3) As a power consumer in Germany, I get a mix of power-sources delivered to my plugs - but I can decide which company gets payed by my power bills. So, somewhere in europe renewable energy (water mainly in my case) is fed into the grid, bought and ordered by myself - while technically the eletrical power I get is produced by all sorts of means, including foreign nuclear plants. So, I decide about the market share of renewable energy, while always getting a mix of all sources. Switching your power provider is thus very easy.

4) Nuclear energy looks cheap on the first look - since many costs aren't included in its price yet, while nuclear energy is going to cause massive costs many generations into the future. AFAIK there is only one country in the world that has already a longtime storage for nuclear waste: Finland: An installation named [Onkolo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository)... (Searching for such a place in Germany is a constant political battle - it turns out, no one wants such an installation in the neighbourhood)

So, nuclear energy is way more expensive than admitted, because a lot of taxpayers money goes into it. I guess, investing in renewable energy will pay off, even if it must be heavily subsidized - because nuclear energy is subsizided as well.

To me it seems that getting rid of nuclear plants alone is no problem at all - but we face a huge challenge due to two conflicting goals: On one hand, we don't want nuclear fuel (because trouble) - and we don't want fossil fuel either (because CO2 and other emissions). But right now it is technically very difficult (if not impossible) to produce affordable energy with true renewable sources only.

2. It is true that germany is importing french nuclear electricity. We bought just under 3 TWh of them in 2013. On the other hand we also sold them 12.5 TWh of our energy in the same time frame. That is because the demand for electricity in certain regions is shifting for short times and the international electricity market is a fine way to compensate for that. All in all Germany exported 77 TWh in 2013 and imported only 43 TWh.  

3. There sure as hell are complications. People are complaining about wind energy harvest sites in their neighbourhood just as they complained about nuclear power plants. The problem about storing harvested energy for when you need it is not entirely solved yet. Also, the decentralization of energy production requires new infrastructure to carry the energy to where it is needed. People ae demonstration against those new power lines when they are ment to be built on their ground. I imagine territorial problems to be a problem in Taiwan too since you guys have over a quarter of our population on just under a tenth of our land. On the other hand Taiwan has lots to Water around it to built things...  

4. This topic is very controversial. It depends on what costs you factor in. There are subventions for both types of energys. There are costs for initial research and development of renweable energy sources and setting up suitable infrastructure. There also are costs for maintaining nuclear power plants and even bigger costs for storing used nuclear power elements and removing nuclear power plants. Also a lot of risc asessment has to be factored in. Mass production of solar panels and wind harvesters are certainly able to drop their prices. It is really hard to tell what will be cheaper on the long run but i thing renewable energys can be competitive costwise in the near future.

true,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"What is being discussed is slightly different. The speculation is not that Scotland would gain automatic entry but that it would be seamless. The idea behind that is there is 18 month between the referendum and 'Independence Day'. In that time frame, negotiations, now with the consent of the UK, which it doesn't currently enjoy, are to take place that means, on that day Scotland leave the UK, it's membership via the UK expires but, with no gap, Scotland's membership, in its own right, would take place. 

It is in everyone's best interests that that take place. Moreso Scotland's than the EU's, but still. Scotland has 5million EU citizens, it has nearly 200,000 non-'Scottish' EU citizen who would lose their residence rights, without a change in the current laws. Even if they retained the right to reside, they could well lose access to various government programmes which they currently enjoy. Scotland also contains a lot of the EU's natural resources, like 37% of the most valuable fish stocks and 60% of the oil resources. 

The former is an interesting one, does Spain 'set an example' with a country that will inevitably become a member of the EU and thus gain voting rights which it might rely on to get what it wants, and also lose the access right their sizeable fishing industry has to some of the richest fishing grounds in Europe, or do they do as they've said they would. Make their decision based on the prevailing mood in Westminster. 

In terms of what is politically expedient, allowing the above proposed procedure to take place, bearing in mind the fact that it wouldn't prejudice future vetos (e.g. on Catalonian accession), then it seems like the 'Spanish threat' is a little overblown. It strikes me as unimaginable, diplomatically speaking, to, in effect, punish foreign citizens to fight a domestic battle. Legally possible but liable to stoke resentment that would come back to bite them in the ass for no real gain in legal rights.

Tu vois, c'est avec ce postulat que je ne suis pas d'accord. Pourquoi un Alstom racheté par GE serait autre chose qu'une entreprise française? Ca serait toujours un fleuron français avec du capital américain, rien de plus. Il faudra toujours un siège en France, un management français, de la production en France etc. Il y a un paquet d'entreprises françaises et étrangères qui sont aux mains de capitaux non-nationaux, et ne sont pas à la solde d'intérêts étrangers.

On ne peut pas comparer Alstom et ArcelorMittal, tout simplement parce qu'Arcelor produisait de l'acier, un produit ""brut"" sur lequel il est inutile d'essayer de concurrencer les indiens ou chinois. Les produits d'Alstom nécessitent un vrai savoir-faire d'ingénierie, et la France est encore assez avancée là-dessus pour maintenir l'activité sur le territoire.

Et puis, admettons que tu aies raison. Dans ce cas, en quoi la vente à un Allemand plutôt qu'un Américain rendrait la situation meilleure?

In that regard, yes, absolutely. I really can get in their shoes. The situation, however, isn't completely parallel as Brittany is a region of France, thus the french identity isn't threatened by regionalism but the opposite is true. I support as much human diversity as possible, so I support regional identity over french identity because the last one isn't going anywhere regardless of what a few regions decide to do.  

About the rest, well, leftism self-defines according to its stances on economic matters rather than immigration, unlike the national front, which considers it a core issue. I'm not in favor of massive immigration, but I'm not opposed to some either, if measures are taken to ensure we don't create an unstable and economically stratified society. If immigration doesn't happen *too* fast, I believe we can absorb and assimilate it without too much trouble. I support opening the borders with countries whose standart of living isn't very different from ours for the same reasons.  

If our identity was ethnic and unable to make people who come here into bretons, we would really be disappearing, though. Most of my friends and acquaintances aren't of breton descent.

It has certainly not appeared in my wallet or bank account – nor has it fattened yours,  unless you happen to be a bond trader or banker. The fact is that all the new money has been spent on buying bonds. QE has thus inflated bond prices and boosted bank profits, but achieved little else.

&gt; Suppose the new money created since 2009, instead of propping up bond prices, had simply been added to the bank accounts of all U.S. and British households. In the U.S., $2 trillion of QE could have financed a cash windfall of $6,500 for every man, woman and child, or $26,000 for a family of four. Britain’s QE of £375 billion is worth £6,000 per head or £24,000 per family. Even if only half the new money created were distributed in this way, these sums would be easily large enough to transform economic conditions, whether the people receiving these windfalls decided to spend them on extra consumption or save them and reduce debts.

1) Basically the government/electricity dealers are deciding how much power costs. see the [circle diagram retail price](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strompreis) 24% is production costs and another 23% distribution.

2) Import/Export is often meaningless because of the connection of the UCTE/ENTSO-E grid compromising of many different electricity nets. 
You can add the flows over time and then Germany is still exporting electricity.

3) Industrial subsidies are largely useless because every country in Europe is implementing their own and is indirectly blaming other countries in order to try to compete internationally. The fear of abstractly losing industry prevents advancing renewables. Spain has problems with their electricity market [""The shocking price of Spanish electricity""@ElPais](http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/01/01/inenglish/1388590410_230748.html) - they subsidied it because of competition too...

4) That question really depends on your view of the world and economics. Scientific studies and reports were made about

- Environment effects on Water, Air (Greenhouse)
- ""Cost"" of CO2 

Renewables and nuclear reactors are different in their management and the grid design involved. You can just buy some small potion of Solar Electricity Production while that is not possible with nuclear.
New reactor designs that are being built right now all cost way more than intended. see [Finland Olkiluoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olkiluoto_Nuclear_Power_Plant)
Don't forget bad management/ppl working at the plant. Human Errors were responsible to some extent in Tschernobyl. Is it ""obvious"" that nuclear power in an earthquake area is ""safe"" since we learned all that is to learn from Fukushima ?
This scenario could lead to insight that the price to pay is simply too high from an ethical point of standing.

Also, this argument is against the deeds of current European institutions, it doesn't counter the need for a united Europe.

true,Galactic_kitten,SWED,Sweden,"You should really look inte different beer types, it's really interesting and can help you pinpoint what types you like. I'll start you off:

Beer is usually divided into two categories, ale and lager, based on how they are fermented. Pils falls under the lager category while bier can apply to both. 

IPA is India Pale Ale, which was made to stay fresh during shipping to India and thus has a pretty high alcohol content. Usually not impressive in taste imo. APA is American Pale Ale and is usually a bit more balanced in taste.

Dry hopping is adding more hops post fermentation, and brings out more freshness. I like this. 

Stout, Porter and Brown Ale are varying degrees of dark beer.  Also nice, although perhaps an acquired taste.

A ""Dark IPA"" isn't pale anymore, so perhaps it should be called IDA instead?",0,1398768961,null,0,false,0,ch4xx2m,t3_248vyx,t1_ch4xx2m,t1_ch4wj79,null,1433571168,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

By definition, what you're saying is that in order for some countries inside the euro to have a competitive advantage due to an ""artificially low"" currency *some* countries have to be doing badly, *some* countries have to have an artificially *high* currency for their needs. 

Which inevitably leads to a crisis where those ""rich well managed"" countries end up having to prop up those countries not doing well. You know, that euro crisis we had a few years ago, the one that hasn't really finished?

Your main selling point for being in the euro is something that isn't intended to exist, it's an aberration, the euro isn't intended to be ""artificially low"" for the Germans because the rest of the euro area countries &amp; Germany were meant to converge to the point where the euro was fairly priced for all of them.

true,webhyperion,GERM,Germany,"&gt; People are complaining about wind energy harvest sites in their neighbourhood

Most people complain that the ""beautiful"" landscape is destroyed with wind farms. Windfarms are actually pretty loud and for that reason they are build far enough away from civilization so that they won't disturb anyone. So typically, nobody will have a windfarm in front of his porch.

Another fear people have is ice being thrown off from the rotor blades due to their momentum, even in winter. So, as I already said windfarms are usually not build near civilization and for that matter the fear of being hit by ice is unreasonable.

Another criticism of windfarms is that it kills birds and bats which they really do.

According to this article here though 1 wind turbine kills only 1-2 birds per year.

j'ai lu ton AMA avec interet, mais je ne peux m'empecher d'y lire une certaine confusion, particulierement lorsque tu parles des differentes technologies Javascript.

Tu cites Nodejs a plusieurs reprises, mais a aucun moment tu ne fait reference a la programmation fonctionnelle, qui est la pierre angulaire de nodejs.

La meme chose avec Angular &amp; backbone, leur premiere vocation n'est pas d'amener la programmation orientee object dans javascript mais d'apporter une suite d'outils complete pour creer une SPA (single page application) se reposant sur une architecture MVC communiquant avec une JSON API (RESTful).

Le javascript moderne (MVC frameworks) tends a faire oublier les outils comme jquery (spaghetti callbacks) et a forcer un style de programmation plus structurer et a forcer une distinction tres claire entre le front et le backednd. Par defaut AngularJS recommande de ne PAS utiliser jQuery.

En ce qui me concerne, avoir une bonne connaissance de javascript m'a pris plusieurs annees.

Certains element que tu as ommis:

* Apprendre a utiliser un VCS, Git est fortement recommande.
* Apprendre UNIX (GNU/linux ou OSX) et arreter de developper sur windows.
* Etre sensibilise au TDD (test driven development), c'est-a-dire tester un minimum son code.
* Apprendre un language serveur si possible utilisant un framework MVC: PHP/Laravel, Python/Django ou Ruby/RoR...

true,drakeisatool,DENK,Denmark,"Actually, I think pimping should be legal.

In Denmark prostitution is legal, pimping is illegal and trafficking is illegal. The reason for upholding the ban on pimping is ostensibly to prevent trafficking and sexual slavery. However, both of these things are already illegal in themselves.

The ban on pimping makes it problematic for prostitutes to have an organized workplace (brothel/massage parlor) because the anti-pimping law makes it explicitly illegal for anyone to profit from the prostitution of anybody else. This effectively means that it's illegal to demand rent from a person that rents a room to use for prostition.

As it is, the prostitutes in Denmark who work in massage parlors all have status as self-employed, they each own a part of the parlor and they each chip in for employing a secretary. But this is not an ideal arrangement as they are regularly harassed by the police, are vulnerable to extortion by criminals and don't have any of the normal protection offered to the rest of the work force.

If pimping were legal in some way, it would be possible for prostitutes to establish themselves and be protected by all the laws afforded regular employees. In addition, it would be easier to prevent trafficking because regulation makes it easier to for the authorities to keep an eye on what's going on.

I don't care for the rest of the arguments about prostitution. IMHO the real outrage is that people who for whatever reason have decided to prostitute themselves are denied the protections afforded everyone else because some people have an interest in keeping prostitution illegal.",0,1398771983,null,0,false,0,ch4yiit,t3_247eza,t1_ch4yiit,t1_ch4w46s,null,1433571446,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt; In 1994, in response to public health concerns over pathogenic E. coli in beef, the founder of BPI, Eldon Roth, began work on the ""pH Enhancement System,"" which disinfects meat using injected anhydrous ammonia in gaseous form, rapid freezing to 28°F (−2.2°C), and mechanical stress. The anhydrous ammonia sharply increases the pH and damages microscopic organisms, the freezing causes ice crystals to form and puncture the organisms' weakened cell walls, and the mechanical stress destroys the organisms altogether. In 2001, the FSIS approved the gaseous disinfection system as an intermediate step before the roller press freezer, and approved the disinfected product for human consumption, as an additive. The FSIS agreed with BPI's suggestion that the ammonia was a ""processing agent"" that did not need to be listed on labels as an ingredient.

NZ is, as you might recall, on the southern hemisphere and thus it's harvesting season there when it's lull here. Transporting apples via ships is *very* efficient, in fact, more efficient than cooling them for half a year.

The EU as a whole contains 28 countries, so obviously it's difficult for all of them doing well at the same time. It's a fairer comparison to look at either individual countries, or smaller blocs (i.e. Western Europe, or Central Europe, or Nordic countries).

Also, the EU (or at least Western Europe) is already a very advanced, mature economy, and once economies reach that stage it's normal for growth to slow down. If developing countries have low growth, that's obviously bad, because everyone is poor and there's a lot of potential for growth that the country isn't tapping, but an advanced, industrialised country can absorb low growth much better.

Lastly, you need to consider demographics. China needs to maintain at least 4 or 5% GDP growth just to create enough jobs for all the new people entering the workforce - anything lower, and even with positive GDP growth unemployment will climb. Demographically, the EU is not experiencing any sort of rapid population growth, and so the demand for new jobs isn't there. Therefore you can have an economy with lower growth and still have low unemployment.

Obviously the crisis disrupts all of this, and the EU's first priority is to claw itself out of the crisis, which it is - albeit slowly - doing.",0,1398778703,null,0,false,0,ch50gd4,t3_249jnm,t1_ch50gd4,t3_249jnm,null,1433572361,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

You are also really oversimplifying the whole hops thing.  Sometime tons of hops is amazing.  Take Heady Topper, its malt bill is as chewy and bready as anything from the UK, and then they dump a ton of hops in it.  It comes out perfectly balanced and is amazing.

The traffic flow over that barrier **dwarfs** those from Scotland to the Schengen area and those flows are all via airports. More journeys would require a passport with Scotland in Schengen than with Scotland in the CTA. That's completely counterproductive to the European ideal and the ideals behind Schengen. 

Besides, passport free travel is, except for some edge cases, only beneficial with large land borders. RoI and UK are island nations, each with a land-border with the other. There is almost no benefit to giving up that 'sovereignty'. Not joining Schengen isn't being a bad European, it's jut abjuring integration for the sake of integration. Technically, that's the ideal that the EU is built on: subsidiarity. The common travel area between the RoI and UK is best handled on that bilateral basis (plus others). Bringing the UK and Ireland into the Schengen area would actually be contrary to that parts of the EU's ideals.

Realistically, being a good EU member is about more than jumping on every bandwagon on the go. Compliance with EU laws is also an important point, and non-compliance is a de-facto opt-out. The traditionally-perceived-to-be-good EU members, like Germany and France, have far worse compliance records than the UK. What's worse? Breaking the law or negotiating yourself opt-outs so you remain within the law? I think that answer to the question is clear, if only (but it isn't) because one is more honest.

For example, I believe a Danish (?) woman was raped when she tried to get a lift from a truck full of men at 3 am.

I'm a man, I wouldn't do that even if I were armed.

Am I blaming the victims? No, certainly not: situations *shouldn't* be this unsafe. But they are, and the perception is that foreigners - especially the inexperienced tourist kind - tend to disregard common sense.

Personal example: I was at this bar with a few friends (female), who eventually said they didn't feel safe. It was just a feeling; I couldn't notice anything, frankly. So we left. There was an American lady at a table there, and she seemed quite at ease - I remember thinking that it couldn't be all *that* unsafe.

In what way exactly would the UK have benefited had the UK government taxed more pounds than it spent through those years?

I mean, how does having the issuer of the pound ""save pounds"" benefit anyone exactly?

Here's a thought. What if a currency-issuer doesn't benefit from saving its own currency, and what if the UK had not, in fact run out of pounds? Why then everything you've done since then has been madness - you could have simply lowered taxes when the economy needed it, and all you'd have shown for it is higher employment, higher growth, and a better off society. Instead you cut cut cut, all on the falsehood that there was no other choice.

A lot of completely unnecessary harm was inflicted by that decision.

Sweden could never do any of that, and most certainly would not want to. It is easy to talk when you have no responsibility as Sweden does. And it is easy to be loved. And we love Sweden.

true,Vive_la_France,YAFrance,France,"J'ai habité plus de temps à l'extérieur de la France qu'en France, visité la majorité des pays de l'Europe de l'ouest, et j'ai des amis et des connaissances un peu partout en Europe. Il est évident que les peuples d'Europe ont des valeurs communes, des valeurs qu'on partage avec la majorité des Homo Sapiens (des valeurs universelles), cela ne fait pas un peuple. Mais on a aussi des valeurs différentes; sur le fonctionnement du marché, sur la place de l'Etat, sur la place de la religion, des niveaux différents d'impôts/sécurité sociale, sur le régime politique, et ainsi de suite, pour ne pas dire une langue différente et une histoire différente. Le nationalisme n'est pas isolationnisme, il faut arrêter de faire cet amalgame. Nationalisme ne veut pas dire chauvinisme, comme socialisme ne veut pas dire communisme. Le nationalisme est une tendance politique qui défend le droit des peuples à disposer d'eux-mêmes (donc l'existence d'Etat-nation). Si le peuple français regagne sa souveraineté, cela ne veut pas dire qu'on arrête de voyager, de faire du commerce, de coopérer avec nos voisins. Se sentir différent des autres n'est pas une mauvaise chose. J'adore la différence entre les peuples, c'est ce qui rend notre espèce intéressante. Imaginez s'il n'y avait plus de nation, plus de culture différente, qu'on avait tous les mêmes coutumes, habitudes, références, quel triste monde! Quand je voyage, c'est bien pour profiter de toutes les différences culturelles, et quand les étrangers visitent la France, c'est bien pour profiter de ce qui est français. C'est grâce à mes expériences avec d'autres cultures européennes que je me rend compte à quel point il est important de rester libre, souverain, différent.

J'aime bien mes voisins. On peut collaborer pour réparer la clôture, s'entraider pour faire des travaux, se prêter du sucre. Ce n'est pas pour autant que je souhaite que mes voisins décident de ce qui se passe chez moi. Avec ma famille, on décide où vont les meubles, dans quel couleur peindre les murs, s'il faut ou non installer une alarme maison, quelles fleurs avoir dans le jardin.

Definitely assault rate (which includes rape there), because murder is something that's so rare it almost doesn't exist and has no impact on average citizen.  
You have an enormous incidence of rapes with a rising trend, while Poland has a very small rape incidence with a decreasing trend. If the trends continue, in a few years you will have more rapes than Poland with its much bigger population. That's probably the biggest issue.

Se di quelle 1000 persone in più che si iscrivono al primo anno anche solo 100-200 riuscissero a passare ad anni successivi, la facoltà collasserebbe. E non soltanto per il problema aule e risorse materiali (che è la prima cosa che viene citata in supporto del numero chiuso, perché è la più lampante), ma anche e soprattutto per l'impoverimento della già scarsa qualità della formazione.

Mi spiego: un qualche giornalista del Fatto Quotidiano potrebbe campare di rendita fino alla pensione a forza di articoli indignati se scoprisse che uno studente può laurearsi in Medicina e Chirurgia senza aver eseguito una sola iniezione nel corso di 6 anni. O, peggio, se venisse a conoscenza che ci si può laureare senza aver visitato un solo paziente uno. Eppure è così.
Questo dipende dal fatto che durante i tirocini obbligatori, i professori puntualmente non riescono (o affermano di non riuscire) a gestire al meglio, dal punto di vista formativo, i gruppi (generalmente da 15 studenti) che eseguono le turnazioni, col risultato che nella maggior parte dei casi si torna a casa dopo aver aspettato invano qualcuno per un paio d'ore in corsia, tutti carini e col camice stirato, e senza aver fatto molto altro. 
Sta al singolo studente avere la volontà di superare da sé queste lacune, ma questo non sempre è possibile.

Per gli internati pre-laurea è ancora peggio: numeri eccessivamente alti di studenti che chiedono la tesi in determinate Specializzazioni ha fatto in modo che i Professoroni ponessero degli standard di ingresso assurdi (es: media del 30 per la tesi in Cardiologia). Per non parlare del fatto che la preparazione della tesi stessa consiste in: 2% preparazione della tesi, 98% lavori di bassa manovalanza per il Professore, che vanno dalle caffè alle fotocopie, sempre per il motivo che ""scusate, non ho tempo di seguirvi tutti"".

Insomma, per farla breve, io ritengo che sì: più studenti di medicina = medici meno preparati.

Because if they had cut back, employment and growth would have been lower. And for what? So that the UK government put some pounds away in a safe somewhere? How does that help anyone?

&gt;Instead of wasting that money on pointless, unnecessary expenditure we could have saved it and tried to create a surplus

Full employment and price stability should be the goals of a free-floating currency issuing government, not a bloody surplus. If taxing your citizens more pounds than you're paying them means that you'll end up with an underemployed society *don't do it*. It's as simple as that.

&gt; or increase our exports

You're clearly stuck on fixed exchange rate thinking. This is understandable - the pound's only been floating since the 90s.

Here's the deal with a free floating pound. *Exports don't bring in more of them*. What they do instead is make the pound higher valued so that it buys more imports.

So I'm not quite sure why you're arguing that the UK needs more exports, but if it's because you feel that ""would bring more pounds in to the country"", you're mistaken. Since the pound freely floated, it won't.

&gt; Underemployment is not that much of a problem, yes more workers are part-time but that means a more productive workforce. Better them being underemployed than unemployed.

The most productive society is one fully employed, where everyone's producing as much as they can. For that, you simply need the government to lower taxes or increase spending. Unfortunately it won't, because it's afraid if it does so it'll run out of pounds. It's this madness that keeps you from being where you could be today.

UKIP are supposed to be a classical liberal, middle-ground of British public opinion party.

Whether you agree it does... that's another argument.

But otherwise they support things like reducing tuition fees, not taxing people earning less than 12K a year or earning minimum wage. Nigel Farage has said that he personally thinks drugs should be decriminalized.

[2013 meat adulteration scandal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_meat_adulteration_scandal)
&gt; There is also speculation that some horse meat from the United States, where phenylbutazone is commonly used, may have entered the food chain via Mexico and then been exported to Europe.[69] One reason for this is that Spanghero had purchased meat from a company, Draap, whose owner, Jan Fasen was previously convicted for fraud; as long ago as 2007, Draap had labelled horse meat imported from Mexico and South America as Dutch or German beef.[35] The primary concern is horse meat from the United States: up to 15% of horses sent to slaughter in Canada or Mexico are former racehorses that have been given drugs during their racing career, such as phenylbutazone, which are approved for use in horses but not humans and carry the warning ""Do not use in horses intended for human consumption."" Further, they are given medication at levels that led a research veterinarian to call them ""walking pharmacies"". These animals may have meat too toxic to eat safely.[70]

Take Independence off the table and the vast majority of people want devo-max (all powers devolved except defence, and foreign policy). I'm talking nearly two-thirds here, at the last poll.

If all they say is 'aye right, Eck, you're deluded', that's going to wear very thin before referendum. It's already worn thin. People want ideas, they want concrete promises on what powers are going to be devolved. If there's even the slightest idea that there will be no forthcoming powers I imagine there'd be a swing to the yes camp. 

Even aside from that, let's be serious. They might be the No camp but they chose 'Better Together' for a reason. They're supposed to be projecting the positive case for the union. They're not doing that, even though what they're talking about is basically the flipside of the same coin. Why is it 'Scots will be £1000 off if independent' instead of '£1000 more per Scot: That's the Union Dividend'. Or something along those lines. (Just an example, I don't believe Scotland will be £1000 worse off if independent but you get the idea). 

Jut on a final point, if you read their white paper and economics papers, they do identify cuts in spending. They also identify revenue boosting techniques, and cost-neutral tax cuts (like APD, which only makes any kind of sense in a UK-wide perspective). Their approach is far more nuanced than 'Spend Spend Spend, but tax cuts too'. Scotland can balance its books, and retain a similar quality of life, but difficult decisions will have to be made.

That's not at all what I am saying. I allowed myself to get distracted from the core issue. Whether Europeans deny it or not is irrelevant, this style of Presidential debate had it's genesis in the United States and is much more associated with the US political system than any other. You guys can deny it, but when did Britain hold it's first US style televised presidential? When did France hold one? And Germany? You can argue that this is some universal cultural thing, but it is a lie. This is part of American culture which Europeans adopted. I don't understand why no one is willing to admit the obvious truth. Europe is so keen to claim things as European in origin.

edit: to add to the story. Some environmentalist group had gotten some idea of what was happening. They didn't know exactly what was being  dumped though. Just that they were barrels, who dumped them and that it happened secretively. They took water samples near those dumps and contact them to get them sampled. What she discovered was not radioactive stuff leaking in the water but traces of some containment substance which was leaking that was found in the double wall of barrels for that kind of stuff.

She was mentioned name, fame and picture at a convention in Canada which had this discovery as it's focal point and got formal felicitations from a French ministers but never knew neither of those things because her boss never informed her thinking she'd get a big neck or something.

On a side note people should read up on what Eurasian Union represents and what ""Eurasianism"" means since its the basis for Eurasian Union http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/06/putin-eurasian-union_n_4911258.html

&gt;It's a strategy to pull former Soviet satellite states back into Moscow's orbit through a combination of incentives and threats. And embattled Ukraine, a huge country of 46 million people, has lain at the center of the game plan.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Union


&gt;International response United States — The United States has expressed its opposition to the Eurasian Union, claiming it is ""an attempt"" to re-establish a USSR-type union among the former Soviet republics.[22] In December 2012, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed ""It’s not going to be called that [USSR]. It’s going to be called customs union, it will be called the Eurasian Union and all of that, but let’s make no mistake about it. We know what the goal is and we are trying to figure out effective ways to slow down or prevent it"".[22]

&gt; In the geopolitical sense, Eurasianism isn’t much more than a policy orientation, a belief that Russia is better served by building its own coalition instead of aligning with the economies of the West. Where observers get worried is who, exactly, is carrying the flag for it now—in particular a thinker named Aleksandr Dugin, founder of Russia’s Eurasia Party and the figure most closely associated with what has come to be known as Neo-Eurasianism.

And neo-fascists that are behind the idea like Alexander Dugin close friend of Putin and Kremlin

&gt;leksandr Gelyevich Dugin (Russian: Алекса́ндр Ге́льевич Ду́гин, born 7 January 1962) is a Russian political scientist, traditionalist, and one of the most popular ideologists of the creation of a Eurasian empire that would be against the ""North Atlantic interests"". **He is known for his proximity to fascism**,[1][2][3][4] and had **close ties to the Kremlin and Russian military**.[5] **Dugin serves as an adviser to State Duma speaker (and key member of the ruling United Russia party) Sergei Naryshkin**.[6]

true,1_048596,,Haltern,"So, /u/backw0rds , if you already got tired of those long and repeating answers concerning your main questions, I still recommend you to check out Answer #4 below. You might be interested.

1. The costs have risen, as they did before our ""Energiewende"". Just as the cost of fuel/gas, food and so on. This has been a thing for years and was never the subject of green technology. (""Energiewende"" means basically ""change of energy sources and related politics"".)
The problem in making out whether the ""Energiewende"" is responsible for the *most recent* rise of cost (remember: correlation isn't causation) is Germany's powerful Nuclear-Lobby. While the main party in-charge (CDU) stands for (slightly regulated, but still mostly) free capitalism, it refuses to let the industry adapt to the changes of politics (which would be ""free"" capitalism in my understanding, ... well...). Being anxious that the economy might suffer and that many companies/whole industries had to go broke facing higher costs (the argument being: ""the industry needs power just as the public does and it has to pay too high a price!"") the CDU decided to free those companies (and many others) from these higher costs. In the meantime falling stockprices, civil wars in middle east and the misfortune of their favorite soccer team losing some matches (just pointing out their arbitrariness), lead most power companies to the conclusion that they were rightious when rising the costs of provided energy. All these costs have been influenced by lobbys, by the blatant goodwill of politicians towards German industries, by monopolies, by the greed of power companies and by too silent citizens, in such a way, that you can't really distinguish whether the real rise of costs represents the net cost of our ""Energiewende"".

2. The point of buying energy or rather importing it, is that you can look for cheaper alternatives. Many say that Germany will additionally need to look for foreign providers in order to secure its basic steadiness of energy supply (the argument being that green technologies are way too unreliable). This lack of free choice will force Germany to pay higher prices and being the laughing stock of nuclear-power ~~fanatics~~ supporters. That is if you want to believe highly influenced politicians, economists and ""experts"". These statements don't hold to actual scientific arguments and scientific progress whithin green technologies consider the opinion of people who *really know the issues of green technologies and the dangers of nuclear power supply*, not the opinion of those who are paid to say certain things. The current problem of Germany's Energiewende is the task of ""how to install a sufficient network"" since new technologies demand new ways of supply. In fact many green technologies are dealing with the problem of *overproduction*.

3. Complications? This is merely a political debate. Until now not much has happened. You noticed that tons of money were flowing from these guys to that company and such. One recognizable fact is a higher percentage of roofs equippedwith solar-power units ... and there's a rising fear of new-build electrical power lines ... mostly among the older population.

4. This is about true... if you want to check out *real* efficient and cheap powersources from the future then just google [""fusion reactor""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power) and [""helium 3 isotopes""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-3).
No Sci-Fi, just distant future.

The point is that the number of corporate motherfuckers who don't want to pay someone a real salary for a real job is too damn high. 

I'm sorry I can't provide you a more constructive answer. Beware, since you can also find crooks who will ask you for money in exchange of papers (I googled ""université bidon pour convention de stage"" and there are actually sponsored results).

Edit: bingo, the result I had is mentioned in [this article](http://etudiant.lefigaro.fr/les-news/actu/detail/article/haro-sur-les-conventions-de-stages-bidons-4746/) about illegal practices. The headline also said that after june 2014 there would be a law indicating that you have to actually study for 200 hrs to get your convention, but I don't know if the bill has been passed yet and how it is enforced. 

I would be reeeeaaaaaaallly prudent with that, since if you are in a fraudulent situation the enterprise will deny everything, everything will be your fault and you might end in a bad position (no job, no monies, no nothing).

The Americans saying that, are not any better than the Euros crying about hops.  If they could put it better, what these Americans should be saying is that we try to develop every style here, and don't just focus on one style.  Germany is really the only country that has no variety.  Look at Chouffe, they make a Belgian IPA, that is innovative.

Our Belgian styles are top notch.  I'm not going to say were are at the level of Rochefort, but we are getting closer.  There are certain dark Belgian beers that have some kind of indescribable smoothness that I have not tasted in ours.  But we are getting closer.  Obviously Duvel has lent their expertise to Ommegang (their Three Philosophers Quad is OUTSTANDING), and many other breweries have partnerships with Belgian breweries.  Allagash uses coolships, just like in Belgium.

Personally I would say Belgium and the US are the best beer countries on the planet.  I love English styles as well, and have not had a fresh cask ale, so I suppose they might be up there too.

In regard to Euro/Americans talking trash in this sub, if you are talking beer, cars, or anything other topic which is not the specific domain of the sub, it gets real stupid, real fast.

Every single person that's ever bet that the Japanese government will run out of yen has lost their money. It's called the [widowmaker](http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/2011/06/06/japans-widow-maker-bond-trade-still-looks-lethal/) for a reason.

Thing is, the Japanese government's going further than anyone else, and they're still yet to run into any kind of financial difficulty. Political difficulty sure, but actual financial difficulty? Nope.

Now considering that they're going further than any other, how can you claim ""it has been shown you can only go so far""?

&gt; Especially as them deflating the value of their currency is drawing more and more criticism.

You mean depreciating their own currency, and you'll note that nowhere have I suggested that as policy. I believe it terrible policy.

If you need more spending, rather than depreciating your own currency (which is effectively giving foreigners your money below market rates), simply give your own people more currency eg by lower taxes or higher spending. This way rather than foreigners *you* get to keep the stuff you produce.

The only reason Japan doesn't do this approach is a) they feel more debt is politically unfavourable, and b) because the central bank spending newly created yen on buying foreign currencies does not show up on the government's books as debt. But personally, seeing as the Japanese government isn't going to run out of yen, I'd simply take the more debt approach.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"This is a pretty interesting article about the situation in Spain, and whether or not the numbers coming from the Bank of Spain are inaccurate/misleading. Here's some bits and pieces from the article that may be interesting:

&gt;In fact, the EDP accounting measure is becoming an increasingly blunt instrument for measuring the extent of Spain government spending and the dynamic of its debt obligations. According to Bank of Spain data there were something like 1.35 trillion euros of Spain government debt obligations in circulation at the close of 2013, as compared with the 961 billion euros worth which count as debt under EDP rules. I dealt with this issue at some length a couple of years back, but leaving aside the details – groso modo – it is clear that there is much more Spanish debt out there than many are assuming. Even more surprising is the fact that total debt obligations rose by some 14.5% during 2013, and that 56% of this increase came under headings which don’t count towards the EDP measure.

&gt;[Spain General Govt Debt: Eurostat vs. Bank of Spain](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HlIATnLY_PU/U1p_xL2qRxI/AAAAAAAAVX4/JpfvqA_Q7m4/s1600/201404-24_181104.png)

&gt;The argument here is not to suggest that Spanish gross sovereign debt is 132% of GDP (which a superficial reading of the headline number would suggest) – the reality is more complicated – but that it is certainly significantly higher than the 93.9% of GDP reported to Brussels under the  EDP criteria. But even more importantly – and this is really the argument I want to get across – in order to achieve a positive GDP quarterly growth figure at this point it is almost impossible to really reduce the scale of the fiscal deficit, whatever Herculean efforts you make. The rest is simply smoke and mirrors. 

cont.

&gt;Lets take the case where nominal GDP grows by 2%, and deflation is 1% – then real GDP grows by no less than 3% (you have to add the deflation number, not subtract the inflation one, if in difficulty ask the Japanese for help, they have been doing this for years). Now lets imagine a case where quarterly nominal GDP growth is zero, but the GDP deflator is estimated at minus 0.4% (aha, now you see where I am going). *Then in this case real GDP grows on the quarter by 0.4% (precisely the current Spanish result).* Supposing that later you revise this estimate to minus 0.2%, then GDP growth is halved at a stroke, since it also becomes 0.2%

This article is pretty wonkish, but it's worth the read. It doesn't seem like anyone knows what's really going on Spain at this point. Luckily, it seems a lot of Spaniards (at least the ones here), don't believe everything the gov't says, and doesn't believe that a robust recovery is right around the corner.",0,1398795759,null,0,false,0,ch58d3m,t3_24an9e,t1_ch58d3m,t3_24an9e,null,1433576154,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

With modern productions in mind that could be argued.

&gt; Germany is really the only country that has no variety. Look at Chouffe, they make a Belgian IPA, that is innovative.

To be fair their lack of  innovation seems to be based on their Holy Roman Empire era Reinheitsgebot.

2) They punish the ordinary people but not the leadership.

Or is that just because the moment they start to show signs of growth, they step on the brakes? If you're trying for growth, why keep on hiking taxes as Japan has consistently done, including in this past year?

The first introduction of their [VAT lead to a recession](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Japan#Japan), for instance. One has to ask - if it hurts them when they do that, why do they keep on doing that?

&gt; When Jean-Luc De Haene when he came into office in '92 had to turn back our fiscal policy and stop the ongoing growth of Belgian state debt we were not bound to a common currency yet.

So far as I know Belgium has never had a floating currency. It's moved from one peg to another, from Reichsmark through to USD through to Euros.

Now that is very significant. When your currency is merely a proxy for another, you have to put aside whatever the currency it is a proxy for in good times if you are to be able to spend it in sufficient quantities in the bad. This was Keynes' advice, as he was similarly constrained by convertibility to gold.

That's where the surplus logic comes from. You need to save the currency your currency is pegged to in good times, forming a reserve chest of funds to spend through the bad. Under these regimes, exports literally bring in ""more money"", as they bring in more of whatever your currency is a proxy for, allowing you to put it aside to spend at a later date. It's under these regimes that mercantilism (that a country should aim to export more than it imports) was popular policy.

And it all bears zero relevance to a country that has its own free-floating currency. They're just two **completely** different regimes.

Maybe they're not trying for growth. But purposefully going for economic contraction is definitely something you don't do either in a democracy. Have you considered them hiking taxes isn't due to them not wanting growth but out of necessity? 

&gt;So far as I know Belgium has never had a floating currency. It's moved from one peg to another, from Reichsmark through to USD through to Euros.

As far as I know since the collapse of the latin monetary union  it only pegged it's currency back to an other in the 90's to the German mark. (After which we were finally able to pull the aforementioned reduction of debt.)

&gt;And it all bears zero relevance to a country that has its own free-floating currency. They're just two completely different regimes. One is a true currency-issuer, the other is not.

I'd argue it's not as long as you try to retain as relatively stable currency of your own.

Les frameworks MVC sont des composants qui aident à structurer, qui sont des compléments de son propre code (ni l'un ni l'autre ne fournisse quoi que ce soit *out of the box*). Je trouve qu'on a tendance à vouloir tout faire avec jQuery, mais il n'est selon pour que pour certaines choses : manipuler le DOM (et donc Sizzle.js peut suffire tout seul) et simplifier l'AJAX (même si plein d'autres possibilités existent, jQuery a l'avantage d'être simple à l'usage et bien documenté). Après pas mal de plugins de qualité peuvent servir pour l'UI (jQuery UI, le caroussel de votre choix, les systèmes de validation client-side pour les formulaires).

La chose à apprendre avec jQuery, c'est de s'en passer : par des frameworks plus complets ou en apprenant le javascript de base (selon sa politique de support des navigateurs plus anciens). Mais comme tu le dis, ce sont des années, pas 6 mois qu'il faut.

Pour les omissions : 

* CVS/Git : Je pars du principe qu'on apprend dans son coin. Le CVS restant très utile dans le développement en équipe ou sur des projets communautaire, ce n'est pas une compétence critique pour un niveau débutant.
* Unix : idem, on peut très bien s'en sortir avec des panels pour gérer LAMP et un client FTP. Le gain de productivité à maitriser UNIX est indéniable, mais dans une *crash-course* c'est moins important.
* TDD : Tu entends bien approche par les tests unitaires, à savoir des tests automatisés sur des processus défini ? Sensibiliser oui, mais je pense qu'apprendre le *Quality audit* à la dure est plus important dans un apprentissage.
* Nodejs et Express reste un langage serveur + un framework. Ce n'est pas le plus répandu ou simple, et il est reste jeune, mais les problématiques sont très globalement les mêmes (suivre une méthode de code/organisation de fichier).

They continue to get the world's cheapest lending on newly issued debt, so no. That's not it.

&gt; As far as I know since the collapse of the latin monetary union it only pegged it's currency back to an other in the 90's to the German mark.

According to [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_franc) it was then pegged to the pound, and then gold. Neither is free floating.

&gt; I'd argue it's not as long as you try to retain as relatively stable currency of your own. If you don't then you'll also be dealing with the consequences of that and might pull some kind of Weimar if shit would really go down the shitter.

Weimar's war reparations were importantly not denominated in Papiermarks, but rather real goods such as gold. Zimbabwe was the same case - despite having a free-floating ZWL, they owed huge sums of *USD*.

Having your own free-floating currency does extremely little to protect you from the dangers of borrowing something you have no jurisdiction over. If you print it to buy what you owe, you'll simply buy up that supply curve and tank the value of your own free-floating currency. This happened to both of them.

It too, bears no resemblance to the situation the UK, Japan or the US find themselves today, where all the debt they owe is denominated in the same free-floating currency they issue.

Um, that was true in the 1990's but not now.  Every major grocery store has artisan bread now.  I can walk down to Walmart right now and can even get some Polish-style pumpernickel bread or German-style black bread that was baked on site or nearby, as well as a dozen other varieties.  Challah makes awesome French toast btw.     

&gt;I'm really confused, because I'm generally under the impression that America doesn't have much food culture. In a recent AskReddit thread it was the general consensus that the national dish of the US was PBJ. I hardly think that that's culture.

German Dude, my city, a small metro, has 500-750 different food carts for a population of 350k.  Ever have a Korean Bulgogi Burrito with extra kimchi, do you even have Korean/Mexican fusion food?  We have 10+ different German carts and [our local best bratwurst](http://www.yelp.com/biz/altengartz-portland) is better than anything I had in Germany since I first visited in 1992, and I know it sounds gay but I fucking love a good sausage in my mouth.  

&gt;I definitely disagree but I'm probably biased. Which countries have you been to that have supposedly better food than Germany? I usually miss the German cuisine when I'm abroad.

It isn't bad, it is just not that innovative.  It needs more fusion with other food cultures.

Dude. It's been pointed out to you that it was done long before. Public debate between political figures happened in ancient fucking Rome and many times more in many forms since and probably before then.  We're not attributing this as some creation of European genius. We're just pointing something out and you come in here as if we've attacked a trademark of Americanism in some wave of hypocrisy. What the fuck? And even if it weren't. Then what? It happens in most modern countries at a national level. Should we really specify it as a borrowed American tradition for you? Should we start to have discussions on how driving cars is a thing borrowed from the French and how hot dogs are purely a German thing?

J'en profite pour donner mon avis sur Rails/Ruby au passage : j'ai du effectivement choisir entre forger des compétences en PHP ou dans le langage hype à l'époque qu'était RoR (web 2.0 et compagnie). J'ai vite senti que RoR n’apporterait que des gains aux développeurs (par les Gems par exemple), ce qui libérerait du temps pour bosser les problématiques ""hype"" de l'époque (ex : AJAX pour des UI qui claque, SASS pour de l'intégration plus rapide). 

Ce n'était qu'une question de temps avant que les autres langages rattrapent leur retard technique (exemple respectif : PHP avec Composer, Nodejs et NPM // Less qui est plus orienté JS ou même Stylus). Comme dit plus bas, RoR reste très efficace pour bootstrapper un projet, mais selon moi son echec à détroner PHP comme le langage *de facto* du web en général rendra son adoption toujours marginale et soumise aux nouvelles technologies qui sortent (dont nodejs/python, cf le nombre de projet web 2.0 arrivés à maturité qui ont convertis tout ou partie de leur infrastructure dans d'autres langages).

Deutsche Bank is a banking whorehouse of the Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst intelligence operation headed in Dachau, Bavaria.

The global banking derivative debt equals at least $1.7 quadrillion now and it increases by the day. This debt alone can never be paid; it far exceeds the World Gross Product. Derivative trading was aided by the removal of the Glass-Steagall Act by Bill Clinton and Robert Rubin. Derivative debt has been used to aid major debt creation so the people of Earth can be further enslaved and forced into a new economic Marxist prison system. If the interest rates rise at the Central Banks then the derivatives market will collapse and take down the whole economy. I believe they plan to crash the current economy around April/May of 2015 and at the very most by 2017. The only logical way out of this fake debt is to have a debt jubilee and remove it all from the system. They may just do this but with a catch and this is why they want you all in debt so you have to fall for the catch. The catch will be you will have to wear an electronic bracelet (eventually a microchip implant) and do exactly what you are told in the new Marxist hell hole that replaces our current system. When they say you have to take vaccine A to be able to continue buying then you will have to take it or no food will enter your belly. A good way to understand how this will work is to deeply study the Obamacare from hell act.

I should remind you that New Venice (Britain) stole the U.S. Navy’s carbon trading software exchange from Cantor Fitzgerald based in the World Trade Center during the 9/11 attacks organized by the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators and the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath. This carbon trading exchange was worth back in 2001 a massive $73 trillion a year and it all went into the City of London (British Empire/New Jerusalem/ancient Londinium) and then so much of this eventually wound up in the hands of the Black Prince’s (Prince Philip) puppet Al Gore, Jr. with his Generation Investment Management.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; Still don't you think the market critics will compare and judge regardless as they did with the British debt during the crisis.

They can say and critique as much as they like, but the simple truth of the matter is that if you have pounds to invest there can be no safer place you can put them than with the government that issues them. As a result of this, no matter what credit rating agencies say, currency-issuing governments simply get the risk-free rate - which for short term debt, is simply the rate their own central banks set.

That is, currency-issuing governments, through their intermediate the central bank, set their own interest rates on debt. They also set their own ""debt ceilings"". If you set your own credit card limit, and your own interest rate, would you worry about how much debt you had outstanding? Of course not. But unlike the government you can't set either of those - your bank does - and so you do rightfully worry.

&gt; Besides. Where would you put the limit then.

Ah, this is the interesting bit. Where are the constraints then, if not revenue?

Well, **all** governments are constrained by how much their economies can actually produce. If you ever allow demand in the economy to exceed that, the outcome can only possibly be inflation and/or shortages. This is one of the reasons that Norway doesn't lower taxes despite that nobody questions they have the financial capability to do so - because they're concerned the economy could not rise to meet the increased demand this would cause. That they'd lose price stability as a result.

Currency-issuing governments are still constrained in the same manner. They can aim for full employment with price stability, but trying to spend beyond that's only going to serve to bid up prices. There's no point. What this means is that when the economy is underemployed the government has the *greatest* capacity to spend/lower taxes - the exact opposite way around to a revenue-constrained government, which is inherently procyclical.

Revenue constrained governments are constrained in much the same way as currency-issuers, just with the *additional* constraint that they have to make their books appear to balance. This only removes from their policy space, putting them in situations like the south finds themselves today - where there's work to be done, people that want to work, but you cannot connect the dots for a shortage of money. Fortunately currency-issuers do not find themselves forced into such a position, although it does not stop them from acting as if they are, eg Cameron for the past several years.

&gt; Regardless I still edge towards eurofederalism and would rather see a common European fiscal policy and debt then a return to the days of old which regardless of what one says were not always as rosey even in the countries with an unpegged currency.

A united Europe with a government at the same level of the ECB would be the best possible outcome I believe. Like the UK, like Japan, such a government would not be revenue constrained - it could simply spend Europe out of any recession. Full employment could actually be the norm, rather than a goal that seems almost impossible for many nations.

It's either that, or a complete break up of the Monetary Union, imo. Something has to be done one way or another though - the current system's most wasteful.",0,1398801332,null,0,false,0,ch5ba7f,t3_249jnm,t1_ch5ba7f,t1_ch5agrz,null,1433577595,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Why paste? It makes no sense to transport water from the generally rather arid regions where tomatoes grow well (think spain) to, say, England. Them Island Apes have enough water, no need to import any, and when the tomato growers squeeze all that water out of tomatoes to make paste, they can go right ahead and use it to water the next batch.


Of course, if you grow your tomatoes in-season in a small unheated greenhouse in your backyard, go right ahead. Also works on a farmer's market scale, but supermarkets won't bother.",0,1398802056,null,0,false,0,ch5bnk2,t3_248vyx,t1_ch5bnk2,t1_ch54uos,null,1433577770,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

For example the EU has places like Austria with 4.8% unemployment, but on the other end places like Greece with 27.5% or Spain with 25.6% unemployments. that's 20+% difference.

But in the US: http://i.imgur.com/tNFh6E9.png the State with the lowest unemployment rate is North Dakota with 2.6% and the highest is Rhode Island with 9% that's only a 6.4% difference between the highest and the lowest.

Also if you look at GDP per capita figures: [US states](http://i.imgur.com/LxPDj7b.png) and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita the EU has Bulgaria with around $7,000 GDP per capita as the lowest, and the highest Luxembourg at $110,000 GDP per capita, or if you don't want to count basically a city-state in the statistics, there's still Denmark with $56,000 GDP per capita. That's a difference of $100,000 and $49,000 dollars respectively. 

But if you look at the US, the lowest is Mississippi with $33,983 GDP per capita, and the highest is Delaware with $71,952. Now the total difference might be similar, but the highest is only little over twice as wealthy as the poorest while in the EU even if you don't count Luxembourg, Denmark is still 8 times wealthier than Bulgaria.

&gt; Worum geht es bei der Energiewende?
&gt; 
&gt; In den vergangenen Jahren ist der Anteil der Erneuerbaren Energien stetig gestiegen – hauptsächlich aufgrund des Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetzes (EEG). Es legt bisher drei wichtige Dinge fest: eine feste Vergütung für das Einspeisen von Strom aus Erneuerbaren Energien, eine garantierte Abnahme dieses Strom durch die Großkonzerne und eine Vorrangstellung gegenüber konventionellem Strom.
&gt; 
&gt; Das EEG ist eine beispiellose Erfolgsgeschichte, dem es zu verdanken ist, dass Erneuerbare Energien ausgereifter und preiswerter geworden sind. Mechanismen aus dem EEG sind daher von zahlreichen Staaten weltweit übernommen worden.
&gt; 
&gt; Leider hat schon die schwarz-gelbe Regierung diese Dynamik beendet. Besonders negativ ist die Entwicklung bei der Solarenergie: 2013 ist der Zubau von Solaranlagen auf den niedrigsten Stand seit fünf Jahren gefallen. 2013 wurde so viel Strom aus Braunkohle produziert wie seit dem Ende der DDR nicht mehr – ein alarmierendes Signal. Daher ist es wichtig, dass der Zubau Erneuerbaren Energien nicht gedeckelt wird.

I personally would recommend a guided tour anyway, because you might miss a lot of things when roaming around on your own (like the remains of the roman city gate in the underground parking garage next to the cathedral) - but that might be th efficient and always prepared german in me :-)

In addition to the archeological museum there is another roman excavation at the Praetorium (residence of the Imperial Governor of Cologne). Information in english can be found [here](http://museenkoeln.de/archaeologische-zone/default.asp?s=4380&amp;tid=474&amp;kontrast=&amp;schrift=)

Don't do what the Bavarians do when they come to Cologne and order 5 beer at once. It gets stale way too fast and if you're in a traditional brewery, the server will exchange your empty glass for a full one, without being asked to do so, anyway :-)

true,njlkmnb,null,null,"&gt; Semplicemente ci tenevo a sottolineare la distanza tra lo stalinismo quello vero e ciò che è stato il comunismo in Italia (due cose piuttosto distinte, a metterle sullo stesso piano quello sì è revisionismo).

Ritornando ai commenti di stefantalpalaru, lui criticava infatti un comunismo (non necessariamente stalinista) che in Italia non è mai esistito, cioè il comunismo al potere:

&gt; Purtroppo, o per fortuna, l'Italia non ha conosciuto il comunismo.

Ok sul fatto che il comunismo si è realizzato storicamente in modi diversi.

Ma se giochiamo per un attimo alla ""fantastoria"" (facendo finta tra le altre cose che gli americani non esistessero), e immaginiamo che in Italia, dopo la caduta del fascismo, fosse partita una rivoluzione sociale vera e propria, e che il partito comunista l'avesse alimentata e fosse riuscito a cavalcarla e prenderne il timone... secondo me non si può escludere, sulla scorta di ciò che era il partito comunista, che il nuovo ordine non sarebbe stato simile a quello di altri regimi comunisti autoritari.

Il seme di una qualche forma di autoritarismo di stato (se non di totalitarismo) insomma c'era. E rimase poi riconoscibile anche nelle dichiarazioni sui fatti di Budapest, nelle reticenze fino all'ultimo (e oltre) sullo stalinismo sovietico, eccetera.

E davanti a chi fa notare queste cose secondo me non ha senso rispondere così:
 
&gt; Va bene avere l'anticomunismo con la bava alla bocca sempre, ma almeno oggi chiudete i libri di Pansa e tenetevi il revisionismo per voi, dai.

Non ne so abbastanza sull'argomento (il bello di 'ste discussioni per me è proprio questo, che mi spingono a fare ricerche e colmare vuoti), ma mi piace pensare che nel movimento partigiano ci fosse molto *ideale* comunista, in senso non dottrinario: un comunismo sincero ed eterogeneo che forse il comunismo di partito, quello del centralismo democratico, della disciplina, dell'ortodossia, della menzogna per il bene della causa, non sarebbe riuscito a soggiogare.",0,1398807345,null,0,false,0,ch5ed7w,t3_23xkuc,t1_ch5ed7w,t1_ch41dd8,null,1433579048,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

C'était une autre époque. Je m'y oppose à l'échelle européenne. Et je n'y vois pas un paradoxe. J'aime la France, j'aime aussi les autres nations européennes, et je les défends. L'organisation de la société à l'échelle d'une ville ou d'une région est démocratique, en effet, les habitants partageant des intérêts communs, mais ça donne des Cité-Etats impuissants. L'organisation au niveau européen devient ingérable. Des centaines de millions d'habitants ne partageant ni langue, ni culture, ni géographie, c'est ingérable. On a déjà l'exemple de la Belgique que je connais bien, deux nations (Wallonne et Flamande, avec chacun leur culture et langue) dans un pays est ingérable.

Il est vrai que surtout la République, mais aussi la monarchie absolue, a centralisée le pouvoir, par plusieurs instruments, ce qui a donné la nation française. La nation est à mes yeux la bonne échelle: assez grande pour avoir un poids (politique, économique, militaire), assez homogène pour que les citoyens partagent des intérêts communs, une langue commune, un sentiment d'appartenance et de fraternité. Il est bien sûr possible de créer une nation européenne, sur des siècles, en utilisant soit le français, l'anglais ou l'allemand comme langue officielle et commune, en créant un enseignement commun, en homogénéisant tous les aspects de la société; économique, social, politique, culturel. Mais en faisant ceci, on ne perd non seulement la France, à laquelle je suis attaché, mais aussi ce qui à mes yeux fait la force de l'Europe: sa diversité. Le continent européen est tel qu'il est, au centre de l'histoire du monde, de la civilisation, de la philosophie, des sciences, grâce aux rivalités, par fois guerrières, souvent politiques, entre les différentes nations européennes.

Ce qui ce passe, aujourd'hui et depuis que les USA ont créé l'UE*, au niveau européen n'est pas un effacement des cultures nationales, cela aurait un impact négatif immédiat, car les européens tiennent à leurs nations. Ce qui ce passe ressemble plus à la Belgique, mais avec 28 entités (ou plus) au lieu de 2. On verra bien vers où ça nous mène, mais je ne pense pas que ce soit un voyage bénéfique pour le commun des mortels. Le bilan jusqu'à présent reste en tout cas plutôt négatif.

Only the NRA. They are pretty much the most powerful non-governmental political body in the US. I own guns, but will never get an NRA membership until they change their views. After Sandy Hook, something like 93% of Americans and 85% of gun owners (myself included) agreed common sense changes needed to be made. They weren't passed because the NRA threatens so oppose any candidate who supports laws they feel are anti-gun. So politicians that supported it, one by one, backed out. Although this has caused some backlash against the NRA, so they might have went too far this time.

Former NYC mayor Bloomberg started a political group that he wants to be ""as ruthless as the NRA"", but for anti-gun legislation. The NRA can be pretty ruthless. Unfortunately there are not really moderate gun rights groups. A lot of gun owners are obsessed with safety and making sure their firearms are safely stored so they dont fall into the wrong hands. 

I can see how people in rural areas support the NRA. Out there they dont deal with the problems New York, Chicago (where I live), Detroit, etc. deal with.
