and/or regions

I duno though. I think as far as everything modern goes we're not so far of. (main-stream music and the like) again depending on where you are. (I noticed a number of French versions of American/English songs on French radio)

As far as individual political viewpoints go you'll find some similarities though it also depends.

As far as the history, and a few fundamentals of each country's mentality, politics and outlook goes you'll find some big differences.

A different thing to note is that the inherited culture, festivities and whatnot due to mixing and whatnot tends to gravitate towards the bigger nations/immigrant subgroups.
This due to both people picking out the cultural aspects they like/know and higher generation immigrants (for lack of a better term :/) just having a higher chance of being mainly German as opposed to mainly Latvian if you know what I mean.

With German ancestry you do some Oktoberfest stuff, Irish some marginalised Saint Paty, Italian you try to make some pasta or pizza, etc but the smaller nations and actual smaller or regional holidays/ festivities/dishes/clothing/... tend to fall a bit more out of scope whilst the major and known ones can get magnified and sometimes distorted.     
This doesn't take away though that some American subcultures have formed on that varied and large basis so as far as cultural differences go I'd agree we vary more which has been preserved mainly by linguistic, territorial and media borders.     
**But** I wouldn't say they're all just plain Americans, with a single American mentality, lack of local food, events, accents, etc. 

That's just plain wrong and I can imagine the culture jokes falling out of place.

true,sparklytomato,NETH,The Netherlands,"I spent several years living in the US and have visited most states. I spent the rest of my life living in Europe and have visited most of Western Europe and some of Eastern Europe. 

The US is far from a homogenous entity. I think a lot of people don't realize the regional differences within the US. When I lived in the US it was on the East Coast, close to New York - very modern, liberal, urban. Then last year I traveled to the heart of Appalachian coal country in West Virginia, pretty much the antithesis of New York - rural, conservative, religious, community-focused. The difference between those areas is pretty huge in every aspect - environment, people, culture, politics. You might feel like you traveled to a different country. 


But at the end of the day, you didn't travel to a different country. State laws may vary, but you're still subject to the same federal government. When you turn on the TV, there's the same channels and the same shows. The same restaurant chains. People speak the same language, and have a strong sense of national pride for the same country, even if they express it differently. Driving along the highway, there are landmarks that pay tribute to the national history of the same country. You see that star-spangled banner flying on every flagpole from Florida to Washington. When you go to the supermarket, they sell the same products. You even get the same forced enthusiastic service in shops and restaurants (which, by the way, is not meant negatively at all; I wish we had more of that enthusiastic service around here, even if it's not sincere).

European peoples have had thousands of years to develop their national identities and attitudes. Some European countries have a history of communism, most have a history of monarchy. Some governments are corrupt, others are transparent. Some countries are poor, others are wealthy. Many countries are strongly influenced by their religious history; some still experience internal strife as a result of religious differences. Some countries want to leave the EU while others want to join it. There are peoples within Europe that harbor deep-seated animosity towards each other, while others enjoy close-knit alliances. All these things contribute to an enormous variety in culture and regional attitudes that is simply not comparable to the US. And then of course the different languages only contribute to the sense of alienation from one another. 

When people say that the US is less diverse than Europe, it's not meant to be an insult or an attack. It's not better or worse. It's just different.",0,1396837425,null,0,1396839647,0,cglxcbd,t3_22dpi7,t1_cglxcbd,t3_22dpi7,null,1433241664,51,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,51

I think it sort of depends on what you relate to when you hear the word ""culture"". Does Europe have more regional/local traditions, customs, architecture styles, historical landmarks etc? Incredibly so, America and Canada don't come even close to that. However, from my experience America is very close in terms of real diversity. Let me make my case.

Where in Europe you have local concentrations of customs, in the US and Canada you have local concentrations of world views, and the towns reflect that. The food, the local amateur sports leagues, the transportation, the architecture(not in the baroque/gothic sense, but in the 90% suburbs or condos and high rises) everything reflects that. You have towns and cities where the dominating demographic are factory workers, hippies, hipsters, IT professionals, rig pigs, writers and journalists or bankers. Towns and cities where 90% of the population are yuppies or retirees. This completely transforms each place into its own. While they may look the same from the outside, one is world centre of live country music, while the other of outdoor sports. If you are in the right place, you can walk into a Starbucks and if you are outgoing enough easily score some connections in film, IT, publishing etc. How do you think Harrison Ford made it big? Working as a carpenter he was hired to build cabinets for George Lucas.

In Europe, every town has everyone, but they all follow local customs, think that &lt;insert alcohol beverage&gt; made in their town is the best in the world, and that people from &lt;insert geographic area&gt; are worse than them in every way. They eat &lt;insert local food&gt; and talk about soccer all day long. And every year they have an &lt;insert local festival&gt; that is just the greatest. From my personal experience, the city that stood out the most on some fundamental level out of everywhere I've traveled in Europe was Berlin.

I don't think one is better than the other, but I do think that Europeans overestimate their diversity.",1,1396846344,null,0,1396854761,0,cgm0yxz,t3_22dpi7,t1_cgm0yxz,t1_cglt86r,null,1433243378,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

If you've been to the Bodensee area I'm guessing a few hours of travel are okay? If so, you could go see places like Frankfurt (one hour by train) or Cologne (two hours) or Munich (three hours). Or if you really want something different, try France. :P You can take the TGV to Strasbourg (less than an hour) or to Paris (three hours). Or rent a bike and ride it to Lauterbourg and back (it's just across the border), not too interesting as a destination but it's something different to do too.

If ""family"" includes children, [Europa Park](http://www.europapark.de) is not too far, but try to go there by car, public transport is confusing at best and it's way too easy to miss the last bus back to the train station. (If there are no children, it's socially acceptable for adults to go there too :P). 

There's tons of old towns and cathedrals and castles. I'm guessing you already know about those, so I'm not going to list them. But here's a few museums that are different in some way or another:

* [Unimog Museum in Gaggenau](http://www.unimog-museum.com), because if Daimler relocates production of some truck to some other city, *of course* the one that had it first would build a museum about it

* [Technikmuseum in Speyer](http://speyer.technik-museum.de/en), if you want to know what kind of leg room people used to have on a 747 and compare to a submarine

* [ZKM in Karlsruhe itself](http://www.zkm.de), in particular the Museum für Neue Kunst, because there's no way I'm not going to plug a museum that has old video game consoles on display and used to have PCs running playable Warcraft 1 as a modern art exhibit (although the museum's focus really seems to be ""confusing interactive installations"")

* Speaking of old games, [RetroGames in Karlsruhe](http://www.retrogames.info/ausstellung) with their unfortunate opening hours

* The [Indianermuseum in Bretten](http://www.indianermuseum-bretten.de) might be amusing if you're American

true,OWKuusinen,FINL,"Terijoki, Finland","&gt;That last ""light news"" was unnecessary. 

Which is why I marked it as light news. I had been thinking on the subject for some time and when this came out I cobbled it up with great enthusiasm. I found it very interesting how the piece showed both racism (perhaps we need this law for Muslims and immigrants), cultural exceptionism (naturally this wouldn't apply for Jews) and then completely absurd escalation (this thing is important enough that we will all leave the country) and name-calling (anti-semitism). I thought that this would be something /r/europe might enjoy.

But perhaps this wasn't the right place.

&gt;Makes you look like a ""persu"" (Basic Finn -party member). 

The official translation of the party name is ""The Finns"" (which portrays the other parties as not-Finnish) or if you want a 1:1 translation, ""The True Finns"" (as in, they are the silent majority). I don't really care what people think of me based on one sole message. I wrote the above mainly for the cabinet-news (as I considered that to be something that SOMEBODY should write, and I didn't see anybody else jumping forward), but then thought that perhaps I should collect some more interesting tidbits as well. 

&gt;We have much, MUCH more serious problems ahead than that.

Yeah, like shuffling of the deck of ministers. To which I devoted most of my time.

&gt;Like the Russian Nuclear Power Plant. Should we take it?

Should have added that. Alas, I didn't come across it when I skimmed through the weekly news. 

Didn't really help that I skipped this news item in Finnish as the whole discussion is pretty much FOR OR AGAINST, NEVER MIND THE FACTS, so haven't really followed the latest development. 

&gt; Oh, and that ""muslim women police"" -thing was also almost a April joke, ""wtf-who cares"" kinda story.

I found the criteria for the police entrance exams to be shocking. It shows that ""neutral policeperson"" means the same as ""native Finn"", which isn't really something you would expect from an organisation that's supposed to be neutral and uphold the peace in multicultural communities. Also, published 3rd of April.

&gt;Young people don't give a fuck about that kinda shit, nor the ""spring-hymn"" news. 

What's this about ""young people""? 

And I think that while ""spring hymn"" by itself isn't very important, it's a flashpoint which we will someday use to judge what is religion and what's tradition. As Finland's non-Lutheran population grows, this will stay on the agenda till it will one year be removed. In some areas of Helsinki non-Lutherans are already the majority. 

I also think it interests foreigners.

&gt; Makes me wonder that how old a you and what's your agenda?

Old enough that I can't use age as an excuse and young enough that I can't use age as an excuse, if that makes sense. 

And my agenda was to write down the piece about cabinet which I beefed up with stuff that interests me as a person. You will note that what I wrote above is very much in line with my comment history. It might not be what everybody else considers as worth writing, but then, I wrote the post, you didn't. 

By custom you were supposed to add the missing news items as it's own post underneath mine and if necessary critique me on false or lacking information (such as forgetting to mention the Green Party). Instead you attack me as an person (I expect the ""makes you look like a True Finn"" and ""how old are you"" were meant as an insults). 

&gt;To make Finland look like an ass?

I'm not the tourist board.

Second, you claim that the posts I put worth are insignificant and uninteresting, then you go on to say that I'm damaging Finnish national image? If nothing else, writing about ""uninteresting"" stuff shows that things are well (no news are good news, as they say). 

Third, the austerity policies are baffling (and the biggest story of 2014, thus far). Everything else compared to it will look insignificant and uninteresting. ",0,1396850730,null,0,1396850916,0,cgm299g,t3_22c0zt,t1_cgm299g,t1_cglu8qd,null,1433244059,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

They did all the paperwork on the boat and he was set up with a job through the Catholic church. At no point in his story did he indicate that there was a chance he could have been sent back. It was quite clear that the west was willing to take as many as possible.

So to answer your question: During the cold war, no. It wasn't done because 1. Those people would face certain jailtime just for even escaping and 2. It was an easy propaganda win for the west.

However, the one exception I know is that the US will stripe you of refugee status (and even citizenship) and deport you if you lie on your refugee/naturalization paperwork (covering up unsavory activities). I used to live next to a lithuanian who ended up being a war criminal who killed tons of innocent people in WW2, but he left all of this off of his refugee form when he got to the US.

But some areas that have a highly visible minority might then lead to the reasoning that this would somehow justify a high visibility across the entire United States, or to equate ethnic (or superficial culture differences) with some other diversity, for example political ideology. By this I mean a true differences in how the world is perceived and your role in it, not lifestyle.

I think it is this ideological diversity that is in danger of being overestimated by Americans and European alike, in part because both continents have everything you want. Maybe the US has more of a form of high-visible, high-noise political discussion that would make you believe there is massive divergences along the political spectrum across the US. Europeans make the same mistake about certain European values, which can be easily detected by the fact that there are arguments about whether they even exist.

The best way to see what's true is to venture outside your home country, and then outside the US/Europe and see for yourself.

&gt;And of course there was decreased violence. You pit a bunch of people who hate each other and want to kill each other, than keep the peace. They can't rise up to fight you because they hate each other.

&gt;Dude...this shit is like Divide and Conquer 101....or did you think a bunch of small European countries no bigger than some U.S. states were able to conquer most the world by sheer military might and numbers?

You're putting up a huge strawman here. I never said it wasn't manipulated in the colonial powers' favour, I just said the Germans and Belgians weren't the ones that 'caused' the ethnic hatred in Rwanda. The Tutsi had been lording over the Hutu from as far back as Rwandese history goes, especially considering 'Hutu' and 'Tutsi' are rather distinct economical classes than ethnic races. 

&gt; Oh, and what happens when you suddenly leave and those two groups who hated each other no longer have a strong-man keeping them from each other? Well, they usually slaughter each other and a strong man gains power.

Your lack of knowledge of Rwandese history is very telling. Belgium spent a lot of money and effort in the decolonization of Rwanda, and attempts in the fifties to increase Hutu political enfranchisement vis-à-vis the traditional Tutsi elite actually led to a full-scale revolt and proto-ethnic civil war which Belgium put practically all its military resources in ending. Belgium didn't ""suddenly leave"", it left after over a decade of devolution, referendums, and 'preparing' the country's administration for independence.

I'd argue the genocide was mainly caused by the tensions because of the massive rise in the Rwandese population since the 1930's, when Belgium began direct rule in Rwanda and Burundi and started seriously investing in infrastructure, education and health. If you read accounts of the genocide itself, and analyses of the prime motivators of the slaughters, it seems land shortage was way more of a reason that imagined fourty-year-old grievances. 

&gt; Actually, it's not arrogant.
It's completly accurate.

Are you justifying your arrogance by acting even more arrogant? 

&gt; Are you forgetting about the Suez Canal Crisis? The so-called ""Death Nail"" of colonialism? Or the moves Franklin Roosevelt made to get Winston Churchill, the Imperialist himself, to acknowledge the principles of de-colonization in exchange for American aid and support during WWII?
I mean, it's a rather well-accepted notion just how hard it pushed it's Western allies to dismantle their colonial empires?


Is that what they teach in American schools nowadays, that European powers decolonized because the Americans told them to? 

That's like saying the US ended slavery because the European powers told them to... Sure, there was pressure; but the economical, political and moral motivators were A LOT more important than outside pressure.

Also, who the hell calls the Suez Crisis ""the Death Nail of Colonialism""? De-colonization had been going on for years by then, with every single African and Asian country (except Portuguese colonies and some French overseas departments) either independent or on a definitive roadmap to independence. 

There's apparently some major historical revisionism going on in the USA, when it comes to their influence in European politics. Not surprising, really, as according to the US version of history practically everything we did and do in Europe is 'because the US told us so'.

&gt; We did this not only because it was in our national interests economically and militarily, but also because we were in a fierce competition with the Soviet Union to win over the newly-independent regions.
 
Yeah, we're all paws on a chessboard, aren't we? 

You're seriously overestimating the USA's influence and power in European affairs, and vastly underestimating European agency.

&gt; Well it depends, many here supported the Irish uprising for independence, the recent Ukrainian uprising and a number of other revolts, but when talking about a African rebel group which had not only just shaken off colonial oppressors, but now had ethnic oppressors, they're in the wrong?

I don't have a clue what you're talking about here. Suddenly the Rwandan genocide was a liberation and/or emancipation movement? Really? 

&gt; The death of the President might've been the spark, but you don't pick up your machete and murder your neighbor without a little tension going on before that.

Oh god. The ignorance. IT'S ASTOUNDING.

Why in the world would you comment on the history of Rwanda, and even assign blame and agency, when you're so obviously blissfully unaware of even the slightest smattering of Rwandese history? What drives you to do those things? Did you once hear a soundbite about Rwanda on the news, or read a small exposé on Rwanda in a magazine, and suddenly consider yourself a great authority on the subject? Did it not, before meddling yourself into this discussion, dawn on you that there's a pretty big possibility there may be people here that *actually* know about Rwandese history and current politics? And that you'd look like a tit?

&gt; I mean....would you say a Jew caused the holocaust if he killed Hitler in the 1930s, but it still happened anyway? 

You think Kagame and the RPF were the **VICTIMS** of the genocide? You think they're comparable to the jews in WWII? Oh my fucking god, at least read a fucking Wikipedia article of something before wasting my bloody time!

&gt; Personally, compared to the other African leaders, he seems to be pretty god damn competent and able, and to top it off, well-liked by both ethnic groups in a country only twenty-years fresh from a massive genocide.

I said who was in charge. The Chairman of the Rada, who under the constitution, has been appointed acting President. Or do you mean the MPs that were all voted in in 2012?

&gt;The government (containing neo-nazis elements btw) was formed in an unconstitutional manner[1] and despite the February 21st deal signed by Yanukovych and the opposition

The title of your source here says **""Vitrenko: USA And EU, With Ukrainian Terrorists, Establish Nazi Regime""**. You think I'm going to take that source as valid? Regardless, it's not unconstitutional - it's in a very grey legal area. Yanukovych was witnessed agreeing to immediately revert to the old constitution, but he fled before it could happen. The parliament voted *unanimously* to impeach him. Yes, it didn't reach the required quota (it required 338, they had 328), but the new constitution which set that requirement was forced through by the corrupt authoritarian strongman Yanukovych to cement his power. As I said, it's not clearly legal, but it's in a grey area, and at least morally I see it as a net-good.

&gt;Victoria Nuland's tape, where we can hear she wants Yatsenyuk as Ukraine's top stateman.[2]

In the same tape, they very clearly also state that it's up to the Ukrainians who they want. There's nothing wrong with expressing an opinion over who you want running a country. Regardless, the west *did* leave it up to Ukraine. As to the five billion, that's in loan programs over the last 20 years, it's not as if they pumped in 5 billion dollars since November last year.

&gt;Considering the National Security and Defense Counsil of Ukraine[4] secretary is a member of the neo-nazi movement Svoboda[5] , that he was responsible for Maidan's logistics and that he refuses to investigate, this does raise interesting questions.

Svoboda is not a neo-nazi movement. This is the kind of bullshit claim that comes up time and time again. Yes, it is a nationalist movement, but to call it neo-nazi is just flat out bonkers.

&gt;but since immediate elections was part of it, the leader of Right Sector Dmitri Yarosh called for an armed coup d'état.[7]

And what's wrong with that? 

I know that psychotherapists help husbands to ""reduce the attraction they felt for somebody"" else than their own wife, or other random people reducing attraction to someone of the opposite sex. Simply because there are logical reasons not to get into romance with that person yet he (or she) is very much attracted to her (or him).

For me it looks like someone is trying to make a scandal from something that never was a scandal at all. Some people can't handle their emotions and need help with that - whatever it's directed at opposite sex or not - there's nothing wrong either with people looking for that help or people providing it!!!

Sure climate is a contributing factor, but in my opinion it's a pretty minor one compared to all the other things I listed in my comment.

I don't go to Italy much, but I do spend a lot of time in the south of France, and I can tell you if the south of France was just The Netherlands but warmer I would find another place to go. 

On a political level, there is even more diversity. In my country we have about seven or eight major political parties, how is that less diverse than US politics in any way? Moreover, comparing Dutch politics to, for instance, Italian politics is even more contrasting. I'll grant you that the differences on the political spectrum are maybe not as stark as they are in the US, but the variation in governing style makes a pretty big difference. You really can't compare a transparent government system like the Danish one to the corrupt government system of a country like Ukraine. 

If you were to think of it from a climatological point of view, then sure, both continents are equally diverse - the US probably even moreso than Europe.

I think that's a good point. The US has been successful in integrating a large geographical area into an empire of sorts in part *because* it really was an integration process. Even though there are pockets of immigrants, the vast majority of U.S. Americans shares one primary culture, they feel they're Americans first. (If we're talking about diversity, then there's also that while communities like the Chinatowns and Little Italies and so on do exist, they're not exactly a local phenomenon; they exist all over the place.) 

Americans have largely been speaking the same language for a while now, have been able to move around freely in the US, have been using the same currency in the entire US, and so on. It makes sense that differences would slowly erode away with the country making it so easy to live wherever you want.

No European empire has ever managed to do the same thing in Europe, even though we've had a few that controlled very large parts of it (the Romans, the Holy Romans, France, Austria-Hungary, and so on). They didn't integrate, and eventually broke up into nation states. We've even had cases like the Roman Empire where any existing integration undid itself after the empire fell, to the point where separate cultures emerged that had different ideas of where to take Latin as a language and so on. And the best/worst part is, this lack of integration is still going on in some European countries today.

polizia municipale - if it´s like here, it´s  not real police at all. It´s kind of security guards hired by the city administration to handle small matters, like parking or noise levels or trash things. They can write fines, but anything else they have to call the real police.

finance guard - usually they might be a division of police/gendarmerie, and they only look into financial fraud matters, though being real police, they can of course arrest, and are supposed to help any citizen in any emergency. regular police/gendarmes are not really trained into the intricacies of the tax code and regulations. 

polizia penitenziaria - I guess prison guards, though I think you won+´t  see them on the streets. you got to have this in finland as well, right?

and there is more we have:

military police - a military institution, made of military which polices the members of the military on military bases and eventually everywhere they are stationed. they check also for enforcement of military regulations. Civilian crimes are passed on to the relevant civilian police force.

""policia maritima"" - probably more unusual. The navy is technically in charge of all the beaches and harbours, and this is kind of a gendarmerie police force belonging to them. Mostly to do with ships but might have to do with regular citizens as well on beaches and things. If your wallet gets stolen on a beach on call the police or guards. If a water bike is coming to close to land or something you call whoever is nearest but it will be the policia maritima who can impound it. they would be the one responsible for closing beaches due to weather and all that.",0,1396862861,null,0,false,0,cgm4jet,t3_22cs8g,t1_cgm4jet,t1_cglplra,null,1433245134,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

as it's your second trip, I'll go on and recommend some different things to you.

Firstly I would agree with /u/hakwood to skip Frankfurt. It's an interesting city but it's not a nice one. Hard to get to and very expensive. 
In exchange, I'd say go to east germany, Dresden in particular. It has a shitload of history and is absurdely beautiful. Also, Leipzig.

eastern Germany is generally cheaper than the west (yeah, the wall still has its effects) and the people are somewhat different. They're more direct and speak worse english :P 

When you're in Hamburg and Berlin go to squats. In Hamburg the ""Rote Flora"" and in Berlin the ""k9"" or ""Bethanien"". All of them have some sort of bar that is open unregularly, just look it uo in the internet. It's something different but nice to see, in my opinion. Also, it's very cheap.

  - caffè jamaica blue mountain, 200€/kg, sarà che non avevo la mia consueta attrezzatura, ma secondo me era vecchio, sapeva di caffè della macchinetta

So the people never voted for him.

&gt; The title of your source here says ""Vitrenko: USA And EU, With Ukrainian Terrorists, Establish Nazi Regime"". You think I'm going to take that source as valid? 

You should consider this statement comes form someone who worked **against** Yanukovych. 

&gt; Regardless, it's not unconstitutional - it's in a very grey legal area. Yanukovych was witnessed agreeing to immediately revert to the old constitution, but he fled before it could happen. The parliament voted unanimously to impeach him. Yes, it didn't reach the required quota (it required 338, they had 328), but the new constitution which set that requirement was forced through by the corrupt authoritarian strongman

So:

* The law requires he president's presence for the constitution to be changed, but the constitution can be changed despite him fleeing because of protest leaders calling for an armed coup d'etat

* The law requires a quota for the constitution to be changed, but changing it despite the quota not been reached is fine

Dura lex sed lex - how can you expect others to respect the law if you don't respect it yourself ?

&gt; In the same tape, they very clearly also state that it's up to the Ukrainians who they want. There's nothing wrong with expressing an opinion over who you want running a country.

Precisely, you forgot the Ukrainians didn't get to vote for him, and he's already signing things left and right.

Also, there is something wrong when the events line up to her scenario, that's called interfering in another country's affairs and goes against international law.

Imagine Sergey Lavrov distributing hotdogs to Occupy Wall Street protesters and saying in a leaked call that an American runner-up for the presidency who scored only 7% in the previous election should be president, and later indeed becomes president.

&gt; Svoboda is not a neo-nazi movement. This is the kind of bullshit claim that comes up time and time again. Yes, it is a nationalist movement, but to call it neo-nazi is just flat out bonkers

Svoboda was created in 1991 and its name at that time was [Social-National Party of Ukraine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social-National_Party_of_Ukraine). It's logo was an SS rune. Take a look at its current leader [quotes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleh_Tyahnybok). [His friend and adviser created a political research centre named Joseph Goebbels.](http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?lng=en&amp;id=137051). [Svoboda marched in support of Stepan Bandera](http://www.les-crises.fr/ukraine-oaodvd-3/), who fought next to Nazis.

Meanwhile New Republic publishes [Letter from Donetsk - ""Busloads of People Are Coming From Across the Border of Russia, Armed With Bats""](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116960/letter-donetsk-not-pro-russia-its-menaced-russian-tourists)

&gt; But Crimea is not the only place where we see Russians. Here in southeastern Ukraine they come as what we like to call “tourists.“ This means busloads of people are coming from across the border of Russia, armed with bats and other unpleasant things, who come to beat Ukrainians who support their new government. They came to Kharkiv and beat the students there, and now they have come here.

&gt; I never imagined waking up in the morning, looking out the window and seeing armed people wearing masks outside, or knowing that they are somewhere near. It's absolutely beyond my peaceful and non-violent reality.

true,anarquistos,LITH,Lithuania,"""Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité"" was the motto of French revolution and it is not the rallying cry of liberalism and especially libertarianism. Liberalism (especially the American kind, which in Europe would definitely be called some form social democracy) concerns itself with positive freedom - the kind you described perfectly. In order to live a free and happy life you need certain things - health, safety and some form social security. 

Negative freedom is freedom from intervention by other actors. In political context it usually means governments. The best expression of negative freedoms is the American bill of rights. Negative freedoms are formulated as ""the congress shall make no law... the right to bear arms shall not be infringed"" and so on. 

The libertarian approach is that if you want freedom, do not make a thousand and one laws and regulations on how people can conduct business. You want equality, make no laws that give privileges to some group of people (rich fucker, politicians and so on). You want fraternity, do not make barriers for trade and ensure that contracts are kept (i.e. stop cheating). A libertarian government should not concern it self with giving people what they want. It should protect peoples lives and their property and that's it. It should make people free by not controlling them and allowing them to live and work.

I'm not saying that this is the best way, and that EU should become a libertarian federation, or should follow USA (which in some regards has even less freedom), but a guy that suggested that EU could have Libertarian party to participate in the democratic process and offer a contrary opinion to the social democrat/progressive/moderate nationalist circlejerk, should not be downvoted to hell and called a fifteen year old.

In the Inglehart scale, a secular-rational self-expressioner is someone who does not even think one minute of opposing something like gay marriage, it is not even a question. So it is a kind of social, lifestyle liberalism, it is the idea of respecting other people's private sphere and lifestyle choices.

But when I mentioned as masculinist and American-styled individualism is **entirely the opposite**. It is about being rugged, tough, not needing help from others, and not really offering a lot of help to others eithers, rather giving them helpful hints to man up and grow a pair of balls and deal with their problems on their own. This kind of individualist - the kind of individualism someone on a Harley-Davidson could adopt - would actually be neutral with social issues with like gay marriage or even hostile to them. Their individualism would be about solving their problems alone, which is a form of ruggedness or toughness, and not really offering a lot of help for others for the same, expecting them to tough up.

This is what I meant that it doesn't fly in Scandinavia. Nor in many, in fact most other European countries or regions, I could only name a few exceptions. So what is a tough guy do, when he has to accept the spirit of you help, me I help you, we help each other spirit of the country? He tries to define ""we"" narrowly and exlusively (nation, race) in order to score some toughness points out of the imagined conflict with the Other. 

Because, this is how toughness points are generally scored - in a symbolic way, in an age and period where actual masculinity is getting out of demand. Either you get toughness points from facing hardship of life without help (rugged individualism) or from facing an enemy along with your mates.

Again I mean it entirely in the symbolical-psychological sense, nobody is actually getting tougher because of it. They are not running marathons or something.

Fair enough. But his comment doesn't add much to the discussion as it would be interesting to know why we would need a libertarian party, ~~never mind the fact that I haven't seen any actual libertarian party in Europe, making it hard to have **more** of them.~~ I can't read properly...

Eh, come investitore posso fischiare via Eataly dal portfolio (cioe' chiudere il libretto di risparmio alla coop), visto che - nonostante i ritorni - penso che danneggi alla lunga la qualita' della gastronomia italiana; e a questo punto preferisco investire nell'industria chimica tedesca..

Come consumatore, posso semplicemente rifiutarmi di spenderci un euro..

&gt; mentre qualcuno tenta di proporre la ""stessa qualità"" in modo più ""moderno"".

Be' confronta Eataly con Ikea, per esempio. 

Anche Ikea produce mobili che - confrontati con quelli degli artigiani piu' eccellenti - sono di bassa qualita'; eppure serve benissimo il suo mercato, senza accampare fumose pretese di cultura e di qualita'. E - in questo - senza danneggiare nessuno; se un artigiano vale i soldi che chiede, avra' sempre e comunque successo.

Ikea offre si' un prodotto simile in modo piu' moderno, ma non ha la puzza di disonesta' di Eataly, con tutte le sue celebrazioni fasulle della cultura gastronomica Italiana.

&gt;The __Costa Brava__ (Catalan: [ˈkɔstə ˈβɾaβə], Spanish: [ˈkosta ˈβɾaβa]; ""Wild"" or ""Rough Coast"") is a coastal region of northeastern Spain, consisting of [Alt Empordà](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_Empord%C3%A0), [Baix Empordà](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baix_Empord%C3%A0) and [Selva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selva), in the [province of Girona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Girona). The Costa Brava stretches from [Blanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanes), 60 km (37 mi) northeast of [Barcelona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona), to the French border. In the 1950s, the Costa Brava was identified by the [Spanish government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_government) and local entrepreneurs as being suitable for substantial development as a holiday destination, mainly for [package holiday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_holiday) tourists from Northern Europe and especially the United Kingdom and France. The combination of a very good summer climate, nature, excellent beaches and a favourable foreign exchange rate, which made Spain a relatively inexpensive tourist destination, was exploited by the construction of large numbers of hotels and apartments in such seaside resorts as [Blanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanes), [Tossa de Mar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tossa_de_Mar), and [Lloret de Mar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloret_de_Mar). Tourism rapidly took over from fishing as the principal business of the area.

But that said, your understanding of European-American Cold War relations or the extent of American influence on the continent is just as pathetic as my understanding of the intricacies of the Rwanda situation-** 

&gt;Is that what they teach in American schools nowadays, that European powers decolonized because the Americans told them to?

No, but it was a very, very motivating factor. Or are you just going to ignore the influence of a world superpower over a devastated and torn Europe? 

&gt;That's like saying the US ended slavery because the European powers told them to... Sure, there was pressure; but the economical, political and moral motivators were A LOT more important than outside pressure.

No, it's like if Europe helped defeat the North, rebuild a war devastated South and garrisoned soldiers along the border to protect from Canadian communists from half-a-century. 

Then used all that leverage to help push for and motivate de-colonization. Oh, and they also have a economy and industrial base that absolutely dwarfs America.

So yeah, I think European influence on the matter would be *a little pronounced* if that was the case. 

&gt;so, who the hell calls the Suez Crisis ""the Death Nail of Colonialism""?
 
&gt;De-colonization had been going on for years by then, with every single African and Asian country (except Portuguese colonies and some French overseas departments) either independent or on a definitive roadmap to independence.

&gt;There's apparently some major historical revisionism going on in the USA, when it comes to their influence in European politics. Not surprising, really, as according to the US version of history practically everything we did and do in Europe is 'because the US told us so'.

Oh fuck off with that *""there must be some serious revisionism in U.S. schools""* alright, it's such a cunty, cunty thing to say especially since you don't know where the fuck I learned it from. 

I'm not here implying you're stupid or that Flanders has a shitty fucking school system or that Belgium indoctrinates it's population. For fuck's sake, **can you be anymore smug?** lulz 

And you're right, American influence on Europe was nill. Minuscule. The Marshall Plan didn't really do much, NATO was a non-factor and there was no reason to garrison troops at the Fulda Gap for half-a-century.

And even if we did do all that shit, I'm sure our influence would've been completely insignificant like you say. 

**My apologies.** 

And really, thank god the Suez Canal Crisis wasn't a watershed moment in European colonialism and the Cold War in general. It totally didn't have a effect on future colonial endeavors when the United States, after the threat of the Soviets going nuclear, stepped in prevented the French, British and Israelis from going any deeper into Egypt, thus also establishing America has the *de facto* hegemon of the Western World...which for some reason...you think didn't have a significant effect on Europe or a sign of heavy American influence? 

&gt;Yeah, we're all paws on a chessboard, aren't we?

&gt;You're seriously overestimating the USA's influence and power in European affairs, and vastly underestimating European agency.

Yes, we are, and no, I'm not. 

What European agency are you talking about by the way? The European Coal &amp; Steel Community? The European Atomic Energy Commission? What pan-European sentiment existed then? 

Europe was divided and still recovering. It couldn't even stop France from leaving in the 1960s; which, mind you, only led to increased American influence on the continent...which I guess...*didn't happen*? Who was Belgium going to rely on first if Soviet tanks came rolling down the street; you would've been one of the first targets, West Germany is basically fucked as is and France is no longer in NATO; yet, you don't think that, combined with NATO, the Marshall Plan and our general participation in WWII didn't give us some pretty heavy fucking leverage?

In 2010 855.000 voters opted for Jobbik, now 985k did. While the 130k new voters are not nothing, generally a sense of apathy and disappointment has spread amongst them and the party leaders and I personally thing this will be yet another step towards people finally realizing how fake and unrealistic the entire party and their expectations are. 

In the first half of the campaign, their critics were pointing out their total ineffectiveness in the past 4 years, and while that could be attributed to the Fidesz supermajority and them pushing everything true, Jobbik was still really learning the ropes in the first half of the previous term and in the second one, they were just...there, with not doing anything meaningful beside the usual hate speech-y stuff every now and then. 

Until now they were the 13 year old teenage boys, who comment on forums saying they could beat up anyone. Now they were beaten up a bit.

In reality, life for the vast majority of Americans is identical to life for the vast majority of Brits. 

Also, there's a tendancy to attribute any action seen as ""uncultured"" to Americans. For example, an Italian guy in this subreddit automatically assumed Americans put ketchup on pasta, even though it's unheard of in the USA (hence why it was parodied so heavily when done on that show about the fat girl). 

Finally, understanding of American politics is *very* shallow, especially when it comes to state/federal differences, etc. I've had to correct a lot of my British friends when they attempt to discuss American politics: I think since political stories in the US are covered in British media but not at a very in-depth level it leads to lots of people having a false sense of overconfidence when discussing those issues.

It is not even military intervention, they had more or less seal the border with Russia.

Now this slicing can reach NATO borders on Romanian side. Will NATO get involved then? In some sort of peace-keeping operation?

The problem with such a procrastination though... that when (hopefully IF) Russia will move beyond Kyiv there will be little regular Ukrainian forces left to conduct face/speech based control to prevent further incursion into still independent Ukrainian territory.

NATO (probably) may bomb shit out of regular Russian army, but can/will they bomb the mob that supposedly consists from Ukrainian citizens (even if only partially)?

Is it new type of warfare that NATO will not be able to handle? Or will NATO will get eventually involved Kosovo style?

And to any objective person reading this those reasons are nothing more than petty excuses. The very same arguments could have been made when Kosovo declared its independence, yet back then the OSCE was more than eager to send in observers.

&gt; It can be objectively judged that democratic standards were infringed even solely by time schedule of the referendum and all the events around it

Which to me seems like even more reason to send in people documenting any potential breaches in democratic standards. And so far there is not yet any *objective* judgement possible that such democratic standards were infringed in the case of Crimea. Those Russian troops were after all officially requested by both the legal government of Crimea and the legal president of Ukraine, which means the whole event was a major legal and democratic grey zone. The situation is not as clear cut as either side would like to make it seem.

&gt; (like putting leader of party with 4% support as a Prime Minister).

Typical propaganda obfuscation of truth. [Of the 100 elected members of the Crimean parliament democratically elected in 2010, 92 belong to outspoken pro-Russian parties.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Council_of_Crimea). [The current prime minister belongs to the third-largest pro-Russian party in the parliament.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Council_of_Crimea#Presidium) The reason his party got a mere 4% in the election is that the Party of Regions, the one the ousted president Yanukovych belongs to, got 82%. Not picking a chairman from a party currently highly controversial in the country seems to be a rather sound political move.

But those facts really don't conjur the strong negative images of a Russian coup that so many Russophobes wish to spread, so they're *conveniently* left out of the narrative.

&gt; None of the parties holding their military forces in Iraq or Afghanistan ever wanted to annex even 1 sq meter from it's territory. Your comparison is ridiculous.

Là, on est dans un cas où des personnes demandent l'intervention de l'État pour je ne sais quelles raisons, probablement reconnaître leur union et s'octroyer des droits que ceux qui ne sont pas mariés n'ont pas. Il ne s'agit pas simplement de liberté. En résumé, pas de loi = pas de mariage.

Pour revenir sur les conditions d'octroi de ces droits, dans le cas du mariage, tu ne peux pas te marier avec quelqu'un de [trop proche](http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/particuliers/F802.xhtml) : soit lien de parenté, soit lien d'alliance.

I agree, but the precedent was set by NATO in Kosovo that any region has the right to self-determination despite the wishes or laws of the parent country, and can use foreign aid to force this issue, so unfortunately were stuck with that instead.

Also note that Russia's actions carry the full support of the legal and democratically elected president of Ukraine. As I said before, the whole thing is a major legal, moral and democratic gray zone.

&gt; OSCE cannot observe a referendum that it doesn't recognize, and in the case of Crimea they were right not to recognize it.

Disagree, since it is so blatantly obvious that the lack of recognition is purely because it does not suit the political needs of the majority of OSCE members.

true,SkyPL,SILE,"Poland, Lower Silesia","&gt; And to any objective person reading this those reasons are nothing more than petty excuses. The very same arguments could have been made when Kosovo declared its independence, yet back then the OSCE was more than eager to send in observers.

http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22ez51/next_crimea_local_legislators_in_donetsk_declare/cgm5z1q
+ google: Differences between Crimea and Kosovo. There are dozens. All of which combined give you a picture why OSCE agreed to send observers there and they did not to send them in Crimea. (And what's your source to justify usage of word ""eager"" anyway?)

&gt; Which to me seems like even more reason to send in people documenting any potential breaches in democratic standards.

But they **did send observers for that**. And they were forced out of the Crimea by Russian forces!

&gt; Typical propaganda obfuscation of truth. Of the 100 elected members of the Crimean parliament democratically elected in 2010, 92 belong to outspoken pro-Russian parties.. The current prime minister belongs to the third-largest pro-Russian party in the parliament.

What you are saying is an obfuscation of truth. Party of Regions was a country-wide winner, the same party that expelled former Ukrainian president and the same party that still has a majority in Kiev. Qurultai-Rukh is clearly anti-russian party. Soyuz pro-communist party, they never went to elections with any ""reunion with Russia"" headlines.

Russian Unity is a new party that never had any chances for large support, regardless who won country-wide elections. People are not stupid, they won't vote on a party led by Russian ex-mafia leader.

And you're the one accusing me for *conveniently* leaving facts out of narrative? Typical hypocrisy.

It's a critical issue that basically makes or breaks the whole thing. That's how you recognize democratic standards from authoritarian standards. Last famous example of referendum in very similar situation was Anschluss of Austria when German troops came with arms before the referendum and were present through the voting.

true,ITALIANCOLOGNE,NRHW,"Italy and Germany - fuck yeah. ","Believe me I'm not a person who uses the term ""fascism"" lightly. It's definitely an overall fascist party by the original definition of fascism - an Italian nationalistic and militaristic movement.  
It's not an actively racist party but fascism doesn't have to incorporate racism, only nationalism.   Due to the Italian history a party that is for nationalism tends to be incredibly near fascism. The Italian nationalism and xenophobic attitude tend to make the Lega Nord's agenda very similar to the one of Mussolini. You'll find ultra-nationalist sentiments just as much as the idea of claiming Dalmatia and other completely insane ideas. While the party tries to distance itself from neo-fascism (just like the German NPD which is an obviously national socialist party) it acts a lot like a fascist party. The main difference between the Lega Nord and Mussolini's fascism is probably the fact that Mussolini regarded Northern Italians as well as Southern Italians as one people while the Lega is more about regionalism and a division between the white North Italians and the ""terun negher"" (black Southerner).  The interesting thing about the Lega Nord is that it's not only xenophobic towards non-Italians but also draws a line between the South and the North.  The often heard ideas of restoring pre-WW2 Italy are very similar to Mussolini's idea of restoring Italy (Dalmatia, all mediterranean islands etc.).  I'd say that the leaders try to act ""moderate"" (I'm exaggerating) and in that regards they try to be like Fronte National but their ideas are actually more similar to fascism. Imagine Le Pen fighting for seccession from Occitane and annexation of former colonies while sending all Afro-French citizens back to Africa. I'd put them somewhere between FN and Golden Dawn.   
Also don't forget that fascism doesn't have to negate the holocaust and that it doesn't automatically means racist. There were many fascist movements in the past that were only ultra-nationalistic without having ties to the Third Reich.   
I'd say that the Lega Nord is highly xenophobic and nationalistic as well as being anti republican/democratic. They are less populistic than Le Pen who tries to gather votes from across France. Lega Nord basically denies half of Italy the right of calling themselves Italian. That's also why they are only present in Northern Italy.

I feel like the difference between (some) regions of the U.S. is probably approaching the differences between Germany, Austria, and German-speaking regions of Switzerland, obviously not to that level, but somewhere along that line (and probably more profound in some ways).  They largely share the same language (I realize in my example the dialects can be quite different), but have significantly different historical perspectives, differences in how they view and identify themselves, different religious, social, cultural views, norms and customs.

There are dozens. All of which combined give you a picture why OSCE agreed to send observers there and they did not to send them in Crimea.

None of this changes the fact that observers were requested to monitor the fairness of the referendum, and were refused by the OSCE. Now I'm not a specialist in international law and I couldn't honestly care less about how much legal foothold a comparison between Crimea and Kosovo is. Russia seems to think they have a suitable case, and the only opinion I care about is what the Crimeans want. Just like back then all I cared about was what the Kosovans wanted. And thanks to the OSCE stubborness, we'll never know if the reported opinion is the real one this time.

&gt; But they did send observers for that. And they were forced out of the Crimea by Russian forces!

Citation required. The OSCE did try to send observers monitoring the military situation, but as far as I know none were sent to monitor the referendum or any other democratic matter, as my earlier source documented.

&gt; Party of Regions was a country-wide winner

Seperate election for an independent government, so irrelevant.

&gt; the same party that expelled former Ukrainian president

Not really, given the armed mob outside the Kiev parliament and the fact that of the 449 members of the Kiev parliament, a mere 328 were present. I'm willing to bet a lot of money that of the 121 MPs not present that day, the vast majority belonged to the Party of Regions (127 seats total). Do you have a list of who was present and who wasn't during that vote?

&gt; and the same party that still has a majority in Kiev

You mean the party that has now been pushed into the opposition, together with the Communist party?

&gt; Qurultai-Rukh is clearly anti-russian party.

And also got a mere 4% of the vote.

&gt; Soyuz pro-communist party, they never went to elections with any ""reunion with Russia"" headlines.

I called them pro-Russian, I never stated anything about their election program. Also, that was back in a time when the country was not on the brink of civil war and disintegration due to the Euromaidan coup.

&gt; Russian Unity is a new party that never had any chances for large support, regardless who won country-wide elections.

Country-wide doesn't matter, what matters is what they did in Crimea. And in Crimea, they were the third most popular party last elections.

&gt; And you're the one accusing me for conveniently leaving facts out of narrative? Typical hypocrisy.

Not hypocrisy, merely irrelevance. If you want to make the point that it is somehow relevant, prove its relevance.

&gt; while the one on Crimea was only ""yes for independence"" or ""yes for joining Russia"" with no option to tick for current status.

Ignoring your invocation of Godwin for its utter sillyness, here's where you once again conveniently ignore some facts. The referendum allowed Crimea to choose between Russian annexation and a return to the 1992 constitution.

Anyway, if you're wondering what to say to a girl who thinks you're exclusive, well, you need to make that clear from the very beginning. Exclusivity is pretty much assumed here in most cases, and even when it's not it's usually not a spelt-out decision. Just make it clear (TACTFULLY) on the first or second time you meet her that you don't intend to be exclusive and watch for reactions.

The joke you told her probably had the opposite effect. She must have thought you announced your intention to ""get"" with her, as in exclusively. I've never been in a similar situation, so I can't tell you what to do to salvage the situation, if you intend to.

Personally, if I wanted to go abroad, I would consider the whole world.

I'd say go to Germany, Austria or France. While Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece etc might be wonderful countries, their economies are still very shaky and I expect you might find it hard to work there. (Though perhaps the violin teaching market is a separate one from the wider economy.) While it might be much easier to work in Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden, those languages are not spoken widely and also they have strong EUsceptic movements. The languages in most of Eastern Europe would present a significantly harder challenge and (generally) you would encounter far right political movements that are much more extreme than anything in the UK and also the job prospects for you might be somewhat harder.

I think your comparison to Germany/Austria/Switzerland is pretty interesting. Obviously those countries are still separate from each other, with their own governments, and woe be unto you if you confuse an Austrian for a German - but while the difference in level of diversity is still quite high, at least it is a more fair comparison than that between other European countries. 

I have to say, by the way, that this is not a bad thing at all. I love traveling in the US; being able to drive from one ocean to another and still be aware that you are in the same country.

Again: they **did** send observers documenting any potential breaches in democratic standards - which is what you asked about. They were refused to perform their duty. Yes, it wasn't during referendum.

&gt; Seperate election for an independent government, so irrelevant.

Oh for fuck sake. Everything that's in line with your point of view is relevant, everything that's not isn't. You've got to be fucking kidding me.

&gt; Not really, given the armed mob outside the Kiev parliament and the fact that of the 449 members of the Kiev parliament, a mere 328 were present

Ex-president was kicked out of his party during it's own country-wide congress where there was no Maidan protesters outside.

&gt; I'm willing to bet a lot of money that of the 121 MPs not present that day, the vast majority belonged to the Party of Regions (127 seats total). 

It wasn't a vote made through MPs but rather an internal vote of a party members. Like in every other democratic country parliament doesn't have a power to kick out people from an independent party.

&gt; Do you have a list of who was present and who wasn't during that vote?

Do you have a list of all the people that voted in Crimean referendum?

&gt; Country-wide doesn't matter,

Really? You did it again? Really?

&gt; Not hypocrisy, merely irrelevance.

That makes it 3 times.

&gt; prove its relevance.

Hands down I don't know what to say. It's like you're arguing that 2+2 &lt;&gt; 4 and I'm suppose to prove you it is equal to 4. Countries interested in an annexation of a territory never ever can have any of their troops deployed on it during the voting process, period. And that's why presence of international troops in Afghanistan is vastly different from a presence of Russian troops in Crimea.

&gt; invocation of Godwin 

WTF?

&gt; here's where you once again conveniently ignore some facts. The referendum allowed Crimea to choose between Russian annexation and a return to the 1992 constitution. This is in effect the constitution that the Crimeans repeatedly voted for in the early 90's, but was suspended by force by the Kiev government in 1995.

I'm very well aware of the situation. It changes exactly nothing. People weren't given a fair choice. It was either join Russia now or become independent - and that means that Crimean parliament controlled by Russian citizen from a Russian Unity party could vote it's own annexation into Russia any time. There was no option to vote for current status of Crimea.

Also one more fact you very conveniently ignored about constitution from 1992:

&gt; In June 1992 the parties reached a **compromise** and Crimea was given the status of **""Autonomous Republic""**.

Then they broke earlier compromise:

&gt; In May 1994, the Crimean parliament voted to restore the May 1992 Constitution.

and in a response Ukrainian parliament abolished the 1992 Constitution within it's own jurisdiction. In 1994 Ukrainian parliament was ruled by Communists of Ukraine which obviously you consider a pro-russian party. So look! Pro-Russians were against Crimean constitution!

* Language: Since you stated you had many Dutch and Belgian friends i would recommend learning dutch, why dutch you ask? Germanic. While Dutch is considered a very hard language to master you will have friends to help you along. The difficulty comes from many exception rules, but after a couple years in Flanders or NL you will grasp dutch well enough to start hearing similar words or even understand other Germanic languages. I can personally listen in to the conversation of a well spoken German or Dane without ever learning a single bit of it (although German is supposedly an official language) Also don't let the trilingual country bit scare you off. The language barrier is thick enough that many people of Flanders never set foot in the french part or even speak French. ([map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Belgium_provinces_regions_striped.png))

* Location: Look at it, no seriously go to google maps and see how far Flanders is from Paris, Berlin or Amsterdam. 

* Politics: The only bullshit you will ever hear coming is independence talk for the Flemish. All around Belgium is a very pro EU country and you can say that you live in the country that has EU's capital.

* People: Both people from the cities in Flanders and NL are very, very accepting of foreign people. Especially towards people from the UK.

* What sets the Flemish apart from the Dutch and why should you choose Flanders: Good food and fine beer and the price you will pay for either. And only the sexiest of Dutch accents.

* I'm glad i convinced you but i'll tell you about some of the cities:

-Antwerp: Very modern, Very accepting of people, Lots of international students

-Ghent: Authentic looking European city, Lots of Flemish students, Good location so you could easily be available for smaller cities around Ghent for violin lessons

-Bruges: [If you grew up on a farm, and were retarded, Bruges might impress you.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780536/?ref_=ttqt_qt_tt) But in all seriousness, Bruges is fucking gorgeous, small river canals, boats, old architecture.

Um welchen Preis?

&gt;heisst für mich noch lange nicht das die Gesellschaft untergehen wird

Du weißt schon, was nach den Wirtschaftskrisen Anfang des 20Jhr passiert ist, oder haste in Geschichte gepennt? xD

Weiß nicht, hab da nich so Bock drauf..

Kannst dir alternativ einfach ma Südeuropa angucken, was die abgekackte Wirtschaft da mit der Gesellschaft macht.

&gt;Aber glaub Du nur weiter deinen Massenmedien und lass dich weiter verarschen.

Ja sicher, gib dir weiter deine populistische, alternative Verblödung. Sagt viel über jemand aus, wenn er sich ständig über ""Massenmedien"" beschwert =)

V.a. wenn man auf BILD-Niveau (-&gt;Massenmedium!) labert. Aber trotzdem danke für die Realsatire!

**Btw, nur zur Klarstellung:**

&gt;Den Ursprung des Übels kann man nicht rückgängig machen

Kann man sehr wohl und die [Lösungsansätze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail#Solutions) sind ja mal bitte 5x besser als systemrelevante Banken fallen zu lassen, was ja mal bitte krass unrealistischer Schwachsinn ist.

Sind zum Teil einfachste Überlegungen, vielleicht einfach mal realistisch und seriös bleiben ;)

Jeder weiß, dass unsere Lahmarschpolitik von Lobbyisten abgebremst wird und Basel nur der Anfang sein muss.

Die Konsequenzen eines ~~Bail Out~~Fails systemrelevanter Banken sollten aber eigentlich jedem vernünftigen Menschen einleuchten und deshalb keine Option darstellen. Man hats ja mit Leeman Brothers versucht, hast ja gesehen was bei diesem ~~Bail Out~~Fail bei rumkam ;)

 No, sparklytomato, not all black people the USA or Belgium or the Netherlands share a culture separate from the white people. Sure, they will (obviously) face racism more than white people do, but that doesn't suddenly mean that makes them all a culture distinct from the rest?

Saying they're a different culture because (racist) people treat them as if they're different isn't really fixing things, you know. It's perpetuating it.

On the same weekend there will be three more votes: [Gripen referendum](http://www.nzz.ch/dossiers/schweiz/neues-kampfflugzeug-2.47670), [paedophile initiative](http://www.nzz.ch/dossiers/uebersicht/eidgenoessische-abstimmung-vom-18-mai-2014-2.49155), [primary health care initiative](http://www.nzz.ch/dossiers/uebersicht/izinische-grundversorgung---abstimmung-vom-18-mai-2014-2.49163)

* The minimal wage is just as polarizing as the anti mass immigration vote. Contra arguments are that it will destroy jobs, increase immigration, prevent young people from educating themselves. Pro arguments are that it will protect people from the negative effects of immigration on salaries, make all jobs worth doing, decreases the wage gap between men and women, decreases costs of social welfare. Currently it's about 50/50, but it will be rejected.

* The Gripen referendum decides whether we allow the government to spent 10 billion CHF in the next ten years buying 22 Gripen fighter jets and extending the air police duty beyond business hours. Very controversial.

* The pedophila initiative is about for automatically banning anyone convicted of abusing children, addicts and impaired persons from working with them ever again. This is bullshit as it is unconstitutional and we have a much tougher law in place which is not automatic. Not as controversial as it should be, as (almost) nobody wants to defend the basic rights of paedophiles.

* The primary health care initiative is the one that nobody knows about. However it is rather important since it wants to codify into the constitution that the ""Hausarztparixs"" (family practice) will always be the primary health care provider, i.e. when you are sick you first go to your family doctor, who then will refer you to the hospital/specialists as necessary, obviously in emergencies you still go to the hospital.
  
* We voted for a ""new"" executive and legislative in the canton Berne. ""New"" because we kept status quo with a left majority in the executive and a center-right majority in the legislative. Noteworthy is however that the youngest national/governing party, the BDP (they are the former moderates of the Swiss People's Party), has lost a lot of votes, which indicates that they will have a hard time in the national elections next year as the canton Berne is their most important canton.

* Our 'Bundesgericht' (highest Swiss court) has decided that Swiss universities are not allowed to turn down foreign students from one of the Lisbon treaty countries if they have all requirements to enter an university in their country. This is rather important as so far the autonomy of universities was seen as more important than mobility. 

* The parliament oversight committee has publicised a report on the ""free movement of persons with the EU"". It says that the immigration was handled poorly and that about 8% of the people who immigrated as workers did not actually work. Another 13% immigrated without an employment agreement but found work within 2 months, but you actually need an agreement to get a permit for immigration in the first place. And there were huge differences between the cantons. It also shows that most immigrants come here for work and will therefore not be hindered from immigrating because of the mass immigration vote. The report was already finished before the vote, but it was only now publicised because the proponent of the mass immigration vote delayed it.

* In the canton of Lucerne they want to introduce regulated student loans from private investors. The trade unions, socialists and the student association have successfully initiated a referendum and there will be a cantonal vote on it on may 18th. Ironically the private company that would handle these contracts went bankrupt this week, reinforcing that this is a bad idea.

Again, citation required.

&gt; Oh for fuck sake. Everything that's in line with your point of view is relevant, everything that's not isn't. You've got to be fucking kidding me.

Then prove how the elections for the Kiev government are relevant to the elections of the semi-independent Crimea government. Until you do, it's irrelevant. 

&gt; Ex-president was kicked out of his party during it's own country-wide congress where there was no Maidan protesters outside.

So there were no violent riots in Kiev when Yanukovych was kicked out? Definitely going to need a citation on that.

&gt; Do you have a list of all the people that voted in Crimean referendum?

There is this tiny difference between an election and a parliamentary vote, you might want to read up on both concepts.

&gt; Really? You did it again? Really?

Yes, because you still haven't how any of it is relevant.

&gt;  Countries interested in an annexation of a territory never ever can have any of their troops deployed on it during the voting process, period

Says who?

&gt; And that's why presence of international troops in Afghanistan is vastly different from a presence of Russian troops in Crimea.

Yeah, one was extremely violent and the other one extremely peaceful. Guess which one any sane objective person would condemn more?

&gt;  People weren't given a fair choice.

The people seem to be happy with the choice they were given, but I guess some random Pole would know what's really in their best interest instead.

&gt; Also one more fact you very conveniently ignored about constitution from 1992:...and in a response Ukrainian parliament abolished the 1992 Constitution within it's own jurisdiction

So basically what you're saying is that it doesn't matter what the people voted for.

&gt; That's the whole story that you so conveniently try to twist into your own point of view painting a picture of an evil Kiev parliament.

The only person mentioning an evil Kiev parliament is you. My point is that both sides in this issue have done a lot of things they shouldn't have done, and which certainly have doubtable legality, but that the main issue at this point is to make sure the people get what they want. Your point so far is ""Kiev == good, Russia == bad, who cares what the people want"", with the inevitable comparison to Hitler's Anschluss thrown in for good measure.

true,Aemilius_Paulus,RUSS,Russia,"Maybe Putin is further escalating the situation only to walk off in the end and sorta say 'see what an amiable and generous chap I am? I could have taken half of Ukraine, but only had the modesty to take Crimea'. 

That way he can maybe try to play off any meaningful sanctions. The West will be so relieved to see him back off that they might overlooked Crimea. After all, Crimea is a done and done deal, international geopolitics are practical, and sanctioning Putin isn't. He won't back down and the sanctions will only hurt trade that benefits both sides. 

Only real solution to containing Putin is expanding NATO... ...Which is the very same problem that led to Putin's mindset in the first place, as he was very bitter to see US break the promise of no post-USSR NATO expansion into the Warsaw Pact and the creation of bases even closer to Russia, removing Russia's sphere of influence. 

The fundamental problem is that nobody seems to recognise that Russia needs a buffer zone. China has one, US claimed two entire continents as its own, but Russia has to be content with NATO bases right on its border, apparently... Obviously it is morally wrong in relation to the independent polities around Russia, but spheres of influences are never fair, the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must -- this is what Putin sees, and to be fair, that is what Russia got in 1990s-early 2000s.

Nicht nur die Theorie widelegt dein lächerlich populistisches Gelaber, sondern auch die Historie mit dem aktuellen -daher vergleichbaren Beispiel- Lehman Brothers.

Lehman Brothers war die erste systemrelevante Bank in den USA, die damals nach Rettung meherer anderer banken nicht gerettet wurde. Was passiert ist, haben wir gemerkt und Südeuropa/Amerika merkts jetzt noch.

Du laberst hier, man sollte einfach mal eben ""ein paar Banken"" failen lassen. Wie ignorant und krass unvernünftig irrational bist du eigentlich? Wir reden hier nicht von der Saarbrücker Sparkassesnfiliale, sondern Banken, die **explizit als systemrelevant angesehen** werden. Frag dich mal, wieso das so ist anstatt die Verschwörungstheorie zu pullen ""ehhhhh alle Eliten verarschen dich, gibt gar keine Systemrelevanz!!!111""

Wenn systemrelevante Banken (laut Wikipedia alleine in DE 36) anfangen zu fallen, gibts ganz einfach ne Kettenreaktion durch die globale Vernetzung (deshalb auch **""systemrelevant""**, was hast du denn gedacht?) und deine Wirtschaft kratzt ab. Ende. So einfach ist das.

Die Tatsache, das du einer antielitären und ""Massenmedien sind so shice und desinformativ!!""-Haltung ablenkst, statt ökonomisch zu erklären wie man systemrelevante Banken ohne einen totalen Systemcrash fallen lassen kann, zeigt nur, dass du einfach sowas von keinen Stratz Ahnung hast.

Jedem ökonomischen Laien könnte demnach schonmal auffallen, wieso man nicht mal grade ""n paar Banken"" fallen lassen kann. Dass du das noch nciht kapiert hast, spricht für deine Stammtischkompetenz.

Das System an die Wand zu fahren und riskieren, dass aus diesem System ein noch schlechteres erwächst ist garantiert nicht die Lösung und erfodert zu viele menschliche und finanzielle Opfer. Du würdest über Leichen gehen.

true,Aemilius_Paulus,RUSS,Russia,"&gt;It's some imperialistic bullshit created by bastards like Hitler or Putin.

TIL Hitler and Putin predate the [Monroe Doctrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine). US gets antsy when Russia sent a cruiser for [naval exercises with Venezuela](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7759892.stm) in their and international waters, Cuba doesn't have the right to self-determination, but when Russia protests military bases being built on its border, it is [le]terally Hitler. 

And US gets two massive oceans protecting it, whilst Russia gets only regular 50-year-interval (or sometimes less) invasions on its territory. You have to understand history, after getting invaded by Westerners with clockwork regularity, it isn't hard to see why Russians want a buffer zone. 

Once again, China and the US get their buffer zones, but Russia isn't allowed one. I have no idea why the West was surprised by Putin, he is a very bitter and proud man who isn't very good at accepting the reality of the modern situation. Or perhaps he thinks he can change it.

Given your flair, I can understand your perspective, Lithuania and the rest of the Baltic States got the shite end of the stick from USSR. But as much as you can bury your head in sand, the concept of buffer states won't go away, it is a reality of geopolitics. Imagine if Russia sets up a military base in Mexico. US will flip its shit. But if US does the same to Russia, it's OK. Last time USSR set up a base in Cuba, US nearly plunged the world into a nuclear doom.

I have mosly heard Westerners talk about Asia and Africa in such a general context. I will agree that in most contexts, Europe is too diversified to generalize (except with very broad strokes, like ""same-sex marriage is making significant headway in Europe.""). 

But Asia is *far* more diverse, and so is Africa. There is a much greater difference between Phnom Penh or Hanoi and Seoul than there is between even very different European cities like Paris and Riga.

I will give you that, European Unionian does sound very weird.

Are you just being wilfully ignorant here, because you sound more like an American who never heard of geopolitics rather than a Brit who probably should read more about foreign policy than an American who doesn't need to on the account of superpower status. 

Cold War did not change anything, US will not stand for a military base on its borders. It did not stand for this ever since its creation, once again, I have to remind people of the Monroe Doctrine and the American perception that the entire North and South Americas are basically their backyard and nobody is allowed in with their toys. 

US and China still maintain buffer zones. You may have heard of North Korea for instance, everyone hates it and yet China enthusiastically props it up because it doesn't want ROK/US bases on its border? Well, Russia is likewise interested in not having a NATO base right on its border, seeing how we only get invaded, oh, like every 50 years and lose, oh, like, several million people each time. I'm sure there is more rationalisation for our buffer zones than the American one. And we aren't asking for two continents either. 

Gorbachev could have sent in the tanks and crushed any rebellion in 1991, but after talks with the US President and promises not to expand NATO into the Warsaw Pact, Gorbachev chose to peacefully diassemble the USSR.

Laut [wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers) einen direkten wirtschaftlichen Schaden von 50-75 Mia. Dollar durch die Insolvenz, plus einen ""Schuldenberg von über 200 Milliarden US-Dollar"", direkt 25.000 Arbeitsplätze durch Kündigung

uuuund (das war nämlich nur der Anfang hehe)

indirekt durch die Bankenkrise dannach gibt es mehrere Angaben, aus verschiedenen Jahren:

Die [Konrad-Adenauer Stiftung](http://www.kas.de/wf/de/71.7075/) spricht auf ihrer Website von ca. **4 Billionen Dollar** Abschreibungen von Banken, **4,7 Billionen Dollar** globaler volkswirtschaftlicher Verlust und  **50 Billionen Dollar** weltweiter Entwertung von Vermögensgegenständen.

Alles in allem:

+ 250Mia. + 25.000 Arbeitsplätze direkter volkswirtschaftlicher Schaden durch die Insolvenz

+ 4 Billionen Dollar indirekter Schaden für die Bankenwirtschaft
 
+ 54,7 Billionen Dollar realwirtschaftlicher (!) Schaden im Zuge der Bankenkrise.

Kosten für eine direkte präventive Rettung angeblich [""wenige Milliarden""](http://www.deutschlandradiokultur.de/lehren-aus-lehman-gezogen.1008.de.html?dram:article_id=261511).

Merkste was?

&gt;die zuständigen Banker komplett zur Verantwortung zieht und deren Milliarden dafür verwendet das wett zu machen.

Das ist ne andere Ecke und sollte auch so geschehen, kann deine Position des Bankencrashs aber nicht befürworten; hat ja auch nix damit zu tun.

Niemand streitet ab, dass ""Privat""haftung vor öffentlicher Haftung steht, ich wage jedoch zu behaupten, dass wenn man die Kosten vergleicht, es im öffentlichen Interesse liegt, stabile Verhältnisse zu bewahren und im Notfall öffentlich zu haften.


&gt;Vor allem was bringt es sie zu retten, wenn sie nur einfach so weiter machen. Der große Crash kommt trozdem, sie machen das so lange bis es das Geld nicht gibt um sie zu retten.

Das ist absolut kein Argument. Wenn man sich genügend Zeit für notwendige Reformen kauft, muss nämlich gar kein Crash (durch das mit Reform gelöste Problem) kommen. Das ist exakt das, was weltweit gemacht wird und das ist richtig so.

Es geht zwar gewohnt langsam voran, aber besser als der Totalcrash. Niemand wird einen Crash besser finden, wenn du mal ernsthaft die Wahl stellst.

Nehmen wir mal hypothetisch einen gewollten Systemcrash an:

Wenn ich das System failen lasse, dann dannach notdürftige, übereilte und unreife Reforme mache um die Bevölkerung zu beruhigen, vielleicht noch  Radikale Kraäfte ins Parlament kommen und ihren Shit dazugeben, wieso sollte diese ""Lösung"" auch nur ansatzweise besser sein?!

Mal davon abgesehen, dass es im Schlimmsten Fall so schlimm mit der Wirtschaft geht, dass die sozialen Unruhen so stark werden, dass in Europa wieder Bürgerkriege und Revolutionen aufkommen.

Jeder lacht zwar über die Floskel ""Alternativlosigkeit"" und das ist ja auch berechtigt in den allermeisten Fällen, aber manchmal stimmt das einfach so. Was gemacht wurde war und ist einfach die beste Lösung, weil es keine andere ""Lösung"" gibt.

However, you still miss on several crucial points, that I stated in my last post but you intentionally didn't see them. So, again:

First, the time of Western world annexing a territory just for the Putin-type lulz is over. It's done. Gone forever. British claim over French throne? Gone. French claim over Rhine? Gone. Netherlands still mad about Belgium being independent? Lol, nope. Lithuanians having wet dreams about Kiev and Smolensk? Only if someone makes a bad joke. Western world even left their majority colonies in third world alone. Gone forever. British have as much claim over still-existant India as they have over no longer existant Kingdom of France, and that is 0. Less than 1, but more than -1.

Second, Russia is still governed by power-hungry imperialistic assholes. The only time it was not was... Uh, never, I guess, unless you count Novgorod as one, but I know barely anything about history of Novgorod. So, as long as Russia is governed by murderous tsars, NWO general secretaries, or 'presidents' who have 104 percent people in a region voting for them, it will be regarded as a threat, and rightfully so, proven twice in the last decade and many more times since 1990s, regarding the policy with minorities. 

And now I'll just comment on your post.

So, now you have what you have. Why on Earth should ANYONE want to be a part of buffer zone of a ruler who has no problem murdering thousands of his own people and speaks alike his predecessor, who murdered tens of millions? That's just dumb, Russia DOES NOT have that right, and will not have it ever until shits like Putin reign. Yes, natural advantage like two oceans is pure luck, but that doesn't give any leverage to Russia. The fact that USA is one of the most awesome countries in this world doesn't mean that Russia has any claim to be in that list.

I see examples that many Europeans are giving as examples based on cultural differences and more specifically political differences.

It's not terribly scientific, I admit.

When most Americans are asked about ""diversity"" they will reference racial diversity. Just google for ""diverse workforce"". And that is how Americans will reference it as that's how it's mostly used in American vernacular.

So to me, it's just a difference in regional application of a word.

Both of our personal experiences are annecdotal, but I know many Asian immigrants. They have always prefaced their stories with ""in China"" or ""in Vietnam"", etc. never ""in Asia"" but I suppose it does happen. 

&gt;Not really a good example. In most it does, in some parts it doesn't (notably: Russia).

That was my point. Overall you can see an upward trend even if its not universal. This also points out inherent shortcomings of making universal statements, they almost always have outliers. Marriage is typically a state issue, but you could make the same argument that in the US same-sex marriage is seeing great progress. But some states are most definitely lagging. 

&gt;I'd argue with that (especially the ""far"" part).

I will admit the degree of difference is subjective. Despite being only a short flight, the difference between Phnom Penh and Hong Kong is striking. It feels like more than a country change, but an entirely different world. Maybe it was partially because of the culture shock of being in such a different culture, but I felt more difference between Asian cities than European. But again, I will admit this is my own opinion and is subjective. 

&gt;As if it'd be the first or last case when statistics are incorrectly labelled. There is no reason to pull out any far-going reasoning out of that.

&gt;The Austrian Yearbook for 1956 reveals that the US accepted the largest number of Hungarian refugees (19,655), followed by Great Britain (13,018) and West Germany (10,934). However, according to the official statistics there were still 87,725 refugees in Austria at the end of 1956. Another source tells us that by summer 1959, the US had taken in 38,058 refugees, Canada 25,513, and Great Britain 20,690. According to these figures 11,471 refugees remained in Austria at this time

The UNCHR has a short article on it too, but it's rather unspecific:
&gt;Twelve days later on, on 4 November, the Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest. The city endured days of heavy shelling and street battles, and Hungarians started to flee at the rate of thousands a day to neighbouring Austria. By the time the borders were fully sealed, some 180,000 Hungarian refugees had made their way to Austria and 20,000 had headed south into Yugoslavia.

&gt; Within days of the exodus starting, an extraordinary operation sprang up in Austria, not only to care for the refugees, but to move them out of the country almost as fast as they arrived. In the end, 180,000 were resettled from Austria and Yugoslavia to a total of 37 different countries – the first 100,000 of them in under ten weeks. The performance of the Austrians, the aid agencies and the resettlement countries was truly remarkable.

As additional fun fact, the right-wingers online have been calling for students to live on loans after they have exhausted their allowance-months, apparently missing the fact that you can only get student loans on top of the allowance. And after allowance is gone, so is the chance for student loans.

The end-result is that students will get more depressed and less likely to get medical help with those problems.

Hast schonmal was von [Basel](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_III) gehört, ja? Ich brauch also nicht an was zu *glauben*, sondern weiß, dass es anfängliche Reformen gibt und weitere geben wird.

Glaubst du ernsthaft die Politik hat Bock sich die Bürger(=Wähler) zu vergraulen und immer höherer Belastungen der Haushalte wegen Rettungspaketen zu haben und sich damit ihr eigenes politisches Grab zu schaufeln?

No – in fact, these figures can tell us very little about the impact of EU-policy-making.”*

&gt;*There are areas like competition policy where the Commission has far reaching decision-making competences derived from the Treaty and does not need to go the cumbersome way of influencing national legislation. Thus here our methods cannot adequately spot the European influence in national legislation. The same holds true for national budgeted policy where we cannot identify the impact of the stability and growth pact in national budget acts.*

&gt;*The famous 80 per cent could be reality in fields like agriculture, environment or regulation of the financial market. Yet, rule production on EU level has been on the retreat since the late 1990s – so far we do not know if this will be reflected in less Europeanized national legislation. There are, however, areas in which there is a major European impact which we cannot measure. With the recent new policies for the stabilization of the European Currency at least for Euro-Countries the field in which Europeanization is not adequately reflected in national legislation is growing.

true,my_baby_ate_dingos,IDF,Ile-de-France,"Il y a peu de commentaires sur ce fil, donc je vais poster une 2e fois pour rajouter mes 2€:

La France soutenait ouvertement le régime hutu de Juvénal Habyarimana, le président rwandais dont l'assassinat à provoqué le génocide. L'armée et la gendarmerie françaises étaient sur place pendant la période de paix entre la rebéllion tutsi et l'assassinat d'Habyarimana, surtout à travers des instructeurs militaires et policiers. Alors oui, ils ont fourni de l'entraînement à des unités des forces rwandaises dont une certaine partie se sont retrouvés du côté des génocidaires. De là à dire que la France à aidé à préparer le génocide, il y a un gouffre.

L'opération Turquoise a établi une ""zone humanitaire sûre"" au sud-ouest du Rwanda qui a eu un effet salvateur et un effet pervers; d'un côté, il y a eu moins de massacres dans la zone sous protection française (il y en a eu, mais la force Turquoise était trop réduite pour établir un réel contrôle, surtout sur un terrain aussi impraticable que la région des grands lacs africains). En même temps, la politique française de ""Vous vous tuez pas, on se fout du reste, ok?"" a permis a des responsables génocidaires de se placer sous protection française. En tout cas, c'est ce que le gouvernement Kagame allège aujourd'hui.

En plus, la force Turquoise a gravement manqué de coordination avec la MINUAR, ce qui a fait grincer certaines dents (celles de Dallaire, le général canadien de la MINUAR, en particulier) et fait désordre pour un membre du conseil de sécurité de l'ONU.

Certaines personnes accusées de génocide au Rwanda sont réfugiés en France, et ne sont pas inquiétés par les autorités françaises. Il ne s'agirait pourtant pas de les renvoyer à Kigali se faire torturer, mais de les remettre au Tribunal Pénal International pour le Rwanda. C'est clairement pas à l'honneur de la France, surtout que beaucoup de ces personnes sont sujettes à des mandats d'arrêt internationaux.

L'intervention française, je le redis, a fait du bien et du mal, mais les personnes qui accusent la France d'avoir aidé les génocidaires jouent à ""corrélation vs. causation"": Ils voient les conséquences de l'action française et concluent que c'était voulu depuis le début.

Pour finir, parlons de Kagamé. N'oublions pas qu'avant d'être élu président, il était chef de guerre des rebelles Tutsi du FPR. Les rebelles qui tenaient une partie du pays selon les termes du cessez-le-feu avant la mort d'Habyarimana et qui ont rompu ce cessez-le-feu et franchi les lignes de l'armée rwandaise le lendemain de sa mort, ou presque. On a tendance à croire que, pour simplifier, ""les Tutsi sont les victimes du génocide, donc ils sont gentils et 100% innocents"". Mais il faut garder à l’esprit que Kagame, bien que tutsi, était un chef de guerre, et donc pas au-dessus de manipulations politiques.

Also, the UK leaving the EU isn't really the main reason I'm leaving; It's more than that.

true,yrdqk,null,null,"&gt; Basically, there are perfectly good reasons why a married man with kids who suddenly feels attraction to men does not want to destroy his marriage and would rather like to reduce that feeling.

It doesn't make any more sense than a straight married man wanting to reduce his attraction to all women except for his wife.  However, what the patient wants is irrelevant if it isn't achievable.  A few decades ago, when the consensus was that homosexuality was some kind of behavioural disorder that needed to be fixed, there were major efforts to find a ""treatment"" for homosexuality.  People tried all kinds of horrific approaches, from aversion therapy and verbal abuse to drugs, electroconvulsive therapy, and castration.  None of it had any effect, and we ended up with a consensus that sexual orientation is highly immutable.  Ignoring all that and pretending that you can turn gay patients straight is extremely unethical, regardless of what your patients want.

&gt; On the other hand, traditionally oppressed minorities tend to get very, very offended at anything that suggests that they may be inferior. Because there is no such thing as the opposite (therapy for gay people to be more fully gay and not feel any attraction for the opposite sex) this sounds like an inequal, inferior evaluation.

Ahhhhh, natürlich. x'DD

Stimmt. Man kann, wenn man den Crash und volkswirtschaftlichen Suizid will. Du sitzt hier in Deutschland, einem der einzigen europäischen Länder das einigermaßen gut wegkam, und nutzt das aus um die Wirtschaftskrise zu relativieren. In welcher Welt lebst du bitte? Geil.

&gt;Und wenn Du als Beispiel für Reformen echt den Umweltschutz anführen möchtest, dann sagst Du doch selbst schon das die Reformen zu wenig und zu spät kommen werden um was zu helfen.

Unsinn, ich hab die Langsamkeit in der Politikgestaltung hervorgehoben, für was kommen Reformen in der Bankenwirtschaft **zu** spät?

Für die ausgebeuteten Bürger, den Staatshaushalt? Denk mal nach was bei nem Crash mit denen passiert. Dasselbe, nur viel schlimmer und länger schlimmer.

&gt;Ich bin der Meinung man kann sehr wohl Banken Konkurs gehen lassen ohne das gleich alles zusammenbricht, und Du hast bis jetzt kein einziges Argument gebracht das zu wiederlegen.

Ist das dein Ernst mit den Argumenten? Dude, selbst die Realität hat dich widerlegt x'DD

Die Realität hat mich bestätigt, wenn ich sage, dass die Verflechtung der Banken so groß ist, dass bei der Insolvenz systemrelevanter Banken ein ganzer Schwanz mit realwirtschaftlichen Unternehmen, anderen Banken usw mit draufgehen, weil die ihr angelegtes/verliehenes Geld nicht wiederkriegen, was sich in einer Kette fortsetzt, mit unterschiedlichen Schweregraden, je nachdem wie systemrelevant eine Komponente ist.

&gt;Oder im Fall Islands, die Banken einfach verstaatlichen.

Inwiefern ist das keine Rettung? Was passiert mit Islands Staatshaushalt wenn es einfach Bullshitbanken in sich aufnimmt? Die müssen auch abgewickelt werden und kosten auch.



&gt;""Um einem Staatsbankrott vorzubeugen übernahm die isländische Regierung im Oktober 2008 die Kontrolle über alle drei Großbanken und erließ Notstandsgesetze.[18] Jedoch konnte die Regierung bereits am 15. Oktober 2008 einer Zahlungsaufforderung über 750 Millionen Euro nicht nachkommen, **wodurch der Inselstaat für zahlungsunfähig erklärt wurde.** https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirtschaft_Islands

Nur nochmal zum mitschreiben:

Die Schlussbilanz kann also massiv negativ werden, je nachdem auch nachhaltig negativ, bei Island glücklicherweise nicht nachhaltig wie sich später zeigte. Kann deine Befürwortung der Konkurse systemrelevanter Banken trotzdem nciht backen, weils leider auch ne Form der Bankenrettung durch die öffentliche Hand ist.

Jetzt bist du mal dran mit Argumenten, im Gegensatz zu deiner Darstellung hab ich nämlich ne ganze Menge erklärt und **du** dagegen gar nichts :)

Klären wir die Sachlage:

Was willst du? Systemrelevante Banken konkurs gehen lassen?

Gut. Erklär mir wie du dir denkst, dass dabei keine Kettenreaktin entsteht und wie man bei einem Konkurs billiger rauskommt als bei einem Crash. Bitte. (Wieso sind auf diese geniale Idee eigentlich ncoh keine führenden Politiker gekommen? Ah ne, sind sie ja bei der Lehmann-Aktion xD)

Other than that, dude: this is not a French thing. This is a flirting thing. Sometimes a girl will flirt with you just for fun and then decide that she's not interested anymore - might be something you said or just her getting cold feet - so she'll say she has a BF.

Das auf ewiges Wachstum ausgelegte Finanzsystem wird früher oder später zusammenbrechen. Besser einzelne Banken Konkurs gehen lassen, dann lernen die anderen das sie so nicht weitermachen könnnen.

Natürlich wird es Kosten verursachen wenn einzelne Banken kollabieren, und es wird einiges mit sich ziehen, aber besser alls das ganze immer weiter zu führen und die Schäden die dadurch entstehen immer weiter wachsen zu lassen.

Das es jetzt schon zum Dominoeffekt kommt ist reine, populistische Angstmache. Es sind im letzten Jahrzehnt schon einige systemrelevanten Konzerne Konkurs gegangen und die Weltwirtschaft hat es überstanden. Das wird aber nicht auf ewig so weitergehen.

An die Reformen glaube ich nicht. Da kannst Du mir das Blaue vom Himmel versprechen, ich glaub's nicht.

&gt;My feeling was that they would be glad to give up the ""Italy"" name and cut bridges with Rome, and just call their state ""Padania"". Am I wrong?


That was indeed the idea back in the '90s and early '00s. The idea was to form a new country so that the North wouldn't have to be bothered with the South. Since the proclaimed republic of Padania actually goes down all the way to Umbria and Marche it's not especially ""Northern"" Italy anymore.  Since the Lega Nord isn't liked in many regions of Italy anymore (Emilia, Southern Lombardy) the actual idea of Padania is much smaller. This has also something to do that only the Northern part of Lombardy votes Lega Nord and that some provinces of the South are more PD oriented rather than PdL.   [This graphic](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lombardia_2013_Coalizioni.png) shows it pretty well. While it looks like the Lega Nord candidate got a lot of votes (the Lega itself didn't win that much) the bigger cities voted against him. He still won with 48% to 42% though.
The idea however is the same: How to cut ties with the South. Since you can't simply kick out the South it would be easier to form a new nation.   

I think they simply shifted towards Veneto because the Lega is really strong there while they wouldn't even come close to win elections in Lombardy.  
The graphs for the Lombard election in 2013 ([here](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lombardia_2013_Partiti.png)) and the map for Veneto 2010 ([here](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Veneto_2010.PNG)) show this.   


&gt;Why do you say that? I'm curious. I realise I'm more familiar with the dumbass bigots who only speak Veneto to me and are nostalgic for the Marco Polo years (like if they had lived them) than with real leghisti.


I just realized that you are actually from Veneto and that you probably knew most of what I wrote. Oh, well.... doesn't hurt for other people to read this. 

The LN is xenophobic because of their ideas about Southerners as well as other the political stunts (Like the one with the boat). Anti-republican might sound a bit harsh but I think that the reason why the Lega is for a federal state (which is actually great imho) is to undermine the democratic aspect. A federal republic would give local governments the possibility to enact own laws and I think that the Lega would pass some crazy laws. So anti-republican is probably wrong. However the idea behind a federal state can also be to gain, and hold, more power in regions where the Lega has already a strong presence. I'm sure that if somebody would be a new region ""Bergamo"" that they'd love that idea because it would give them a majority in the new parliament.  I doubt that they actually favor federalism because of decentralization of power.   
 I totally agree with you point on Marco Polo. It's one thing to have a cultural identity because of an actual culture, language or century long movement. The idea that people like the Serenissima makes just as much sense as people in Ancona thinking about the Papal States.  I think that they also often forget that Venice had more of an international culture since it had so many religions and languages. You don't hear anybody in Greece talk about how great the Turkish Empire was.   
They can obviously like their region but to compare Venetian with Catalan or Scottish is kind of absurd.

Du bist dir sicher, dass es irgendwann...nun ja... nicht einfach unterm Strich aufhören wird zu wachsen...ähm...anstatt zusammenzubrechen?

Oh Gott... und jetzt kommen so viele abgefuckte Kausalitäten, dass es fast schon gar nicht den Erklärungsaufwand lohnt:

&gt;Besser einzelne Banken Konkurs gehen lassen, dann lernen die anderen das sie so nicht weitermachen könnnen.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail#Historical_examples

Hat ja gut geklappt mit dem Lernen...nicht.

&gt;Natürlich wird es Kosten verursachen wenn einzelne Banken kollabieren, und es wird einiges mit sich ziehen, aber besser alls das ganze immer weiter zu führen und die Schäden die dadurch entstehen immer weiter wachsen zu lassen.

Also lieber jetzt super viel Schaden, als immer ein bisschen Schaden? Welchen Schaden eigentlich? xD

Vergleichen wir unsere Szenarien:

1. Nehmen wir an, du rettest die systemrelevanten, kaputten Banken nicht. Sparst dir 500 Mia. Euro. Ok.

  Was ist mit deiner Wirtschaft passiert? Sie ist um ca. 20 Billionen Euro geschädigt. Ok.

  Bilanz: 19,5 Bio Euro Schaden.

2. Du rettest die systemrelevanten, kaputten Banken. Latzt ca. 500Mia Euro.

  Deine Wirtschaft wird wegen entgangener öffentlicher Investitionen die in die Rettung gesteckt wurden um wenige Milliarden geschwächt, die kaputte Bank ist ""gerettet"" und macht nur -sagen wir- 2Billionen Euro kaputt.

  Bilanz: 2,5 Billionen Euro Schaden


Was ist also tendenziell besser? Richtig, die Rettung.

Was muss getan werden? Richtig: Verhältnisse schaffen, dass Banken einfach nicht mehr systemrelevant sind und ruhig kaputt gehen können ohne sie zu retten.

Ist das im Moment so? Nein. Wessen Methode ist im Moment besser? Meine. Also was eigentlich so ziemlich überall auf der Welt zu so ziemlich jeder Zeit mit systemrelevanten Banken gemacht wurde. Aber du bist ja cleverer als die anderen, haha ;)

&gt;Es sind im letzten Jahrzehnt schon einige systemrelevanten Konzerne Konkurs gegangen und die Weltwirtschaft hat es überstanden. Das wird aber nicht auf ewig so weitergehen.

Sie hat es überstanden, es gab aber Riesenschäden die auch nur wegen massiver Investitionen eingeämmt wurden. Hätte bei ner Rettung weniger gekostet.


Nebenbei widersprichst du dir in einem Punkt selber:

Du sagst, es geht so schon seit eh und je und man hats immer überstanden. Das impliziert, dass es auch in Zukunft so sein wird und man systemrelevante Banken kaputt gehen lassen kann, weil mans ja immer überstehen wird. Im nächsten Satz sagst du es könne so **nicht** ewig weiter gehen.

Entscheid dich mal.

&gt;Kurz um, wenn wir so weitermachen, dann wird's zum ""totalen Systemcrash"" führen. Darum bin ich dafür jetzt einzelne Banken und Konzerne crashen zu lassen, anstatt ihnen dabei behilflich zu sein so weiter zu machen.

Jaja, das Gelaber vom großen Systemcrash. Wie sieht der denn aus? irgendwelche Theorie dahinter, oder nur heiße Luft um die es sich nicht zu reden lohnt? Wo kommt der Crash her, wieso ist er der endgültige Crash und wieso unterscheidet er sich von anderen historischen Crashs??

Essentiell sagst du ""Lieber jetzt Crash als später"". Kein Argument wieso dein Crash jetzt besser und billiger sein soll, als der Spätere.

Um sich das mal vorzustellen: Die Historie zeigt, dass der Mensch von einem Crash zum anderen kommt (auch wenn die Wirtschatf unterm Strich immer stärker wurde *bis jetzt und in nahe Zukunft*). Macht es nicht mehr Sinn die Abstände zwischen den Crashs durch herauszögern zu erhöhen, damit ein bestimmtes Wirtschaftsniveau einigermaßen stabil zu halten, statt die Abstände zu verringern und krasseste Konjunkturkurven zu erhalten?

Du fickst gerade ein Primat der Finanzpolitik, nämlich Stabilität.

Das -und dein seltsames, formloses Hirngespinst ""Totalcrash"" (wth soll das sein? Wieso sollte unser System wenn wir es so belassen nicht einfach weiter so crashen wie jetzt? Wieso crasht es irgendwann endgültig ? xD)- zeigt, dass du dir noch nie richtig Gedanken um Ökonomie gemacht hast und einfach nur bissjen gegen den Strom schwimmen willst und krasses Zeug reden willst, obwohl du gar nix von dir unterbauen kannst. Alles heiße Luft.

&gt;Das ist meine Meinung.

Schön. Aber argumentier mal, statt nur unhaltbare -da unfundierte- Meinungen abzugeben.

Gathering information from an unnamed senior official in France’s intelligence community, Le Monde certified that the DGSE and US intelligence sources had established a method of data exchange as early as late 2011.

&gt; In the realm of electronic data transfers, France and the DGSE hold a strong position. Submarine cables carrying data from locations such as Africa and Afghanistan are affixed in Marseilles, France and Penmarc, Britain, allowing the DGSE to intercept and record most of this internally transferred information.

&gt; According to the same unnamed source, “This is a trade established between the management of the NSA and the DGSE… Entire blocks are given in these areas, and in return, they give us parts of the world where we are absent.” Even more interestingly, the source noted that “the negotiation was not done at once, the scope of sharing widens over talks that still persist today.”

That said however, this is the thing. 

**The European Union wasn't a thing then.** 

Europe was divided; it's military framework on the continent revolved around the United States and Great Britain *(which not only had a special relationship with the United States, but was loosing it's colonial empire to draw upon, thus making it that much more indebt to the United States if it wished to retain it's prominence)*. France, as I mentioned above, had left NATO during this time period. Half of Germany was in Soviet hands, as was all of Poland *(two VERY IMPORTANT states, both militarily and economically, when talking about the European Union)*. 

There was no Schengen Area, there was no Euro or Common Defense Policy or Maastricht Treaty. Sweden was still neutral, Austria was/is neutral, Finland was/is weary as fuck and Switzerland still had every international bridge/tunnel crossing rigged to blow, with fallout shelters required in every home. 

Fuck, Soviet invasion plans from the 80s actually revolved around rushing the Low Countries first and completely ignoring France to try and keep them out the war, while cutting off the Americans, West Germans and British soldiers in Germany from their supply ports there *(your country really does get fucked by the same general plan in every World War, huh?)*. 

So, before the 2000s, the economic and political might of a unified Europe was all but non-existent. The soft power of Europe was all but non-existent and the effect of American influence over the continent can not be under-stated during this period. 

And even now, chronic under-spending on your militaries has resulted in shit like Libya, which required extensive American logistics, intelligence, and first strike aircraft *(B2s &amp; Tomahawks to hit SAM sites before the other bombers come in)*. I mean, one European military was reduced to dropping cement training bombs on Libyan targets because of inadequate national supply-lines. 

Now, you'll be fine in a total war scenario, you're one of the wealthiest and technologically advanced regions on the planet. But here's the thing, we live in a *nuclear age*. Total war might not happen, the next war might be short, decisive and limited...decided in the first couple days, not the first couple months/years. 

If you want to defend France or Germany from a modern-day Russian attack where you have a rather manageable timetable? By all means you're capable of doing it independently. 

Want to defend Estonia where power projection is key *(hence dependent on logistics, intelligence and first-strike aircraft)* and will require a rapid response? You won't be able to do it without the United States. This affords us more influence through hard power.

So to this day American soft &amp; hard power is still significant on the continent, but not hegemonic. But before the EU formed, Germany united and France re-joined NATO?

Everyone here casually misses the fact that this ""promise"" is worthless and damn well illegal. You can't just give something that is not yours to give. People are not meat to trade and be split away in areas of influence, not in this region and not anymore at least. That shit will not fly in the 21st century. 

NATO may or may not have expanded on it's own will if this would not have happened, but governments of ex-soviet countries have insisted **heavily** and lobbied for their integration under pressure from their constituents and fear of ""mother"" Russia. It went as far as governments giving away many industrial and mineral assets over to US and Western Europe ownership in exchange for NATO integration. The people of Russia have no idea the kind of hate and fear their country have seeded through-out these states and cannot understand that Russia was an enemy and an oppressor for decades in this region rather than a protector.

§ 823 BGB handles the liability if you are at fault ( Verschuldenshaftung). It basicaly says that if you fulfill 5 requirements you are at fault. These are:

* causality
* illegal
* monetary harm
* fault
* damage to someone

If you fulfill every of these 5 then you are liable. If you do not fulfill these a car driver also has § 7 StVG (Gefährdungshaftung) and is liable because his car poses potential harm. This law is not about fault but there to protect potential victims and basicaly in case of an accident between a car and a pedestrian, the pedestrian is most likely always the victim.

Of course any damage to the vehicle might have to be paid by the victim if he fulfills the requirement of § 823 BGB.

Am 5. Juli 1943 begann die letzte ~~große~~(because too many ""groß""s here) deutsche Großoffensive an der Ostfront. Sie wurde Unternehmen Zitadelle genannt. Das Ziel war die russische Großstadt Kursk.

Im selben Jahr kam es zu ein Bogen (do you mean ""Wendung"" in the sense of 'change'?) an der sowjetischen Grenze in der Nähe von Kursk, einer Großstadt zwischen Orjol und Charkow. Der Plan war, die Gefahr einer sowjetischer Offensive in der Bogen (?) zu zerstören und *eine große Menge von Gefangenen für Zwangsarbeit zu machen (not wrong, but a little better: eine große Anzahl Gefangener für Zwangsarbeit zu gewinnen)*. Hitler und seine Kommandanten, Generalfeldmarschall Erich von Manstein und Generalfeldmarschall Günther von Kluge, planten aus dem Norden und dem Süden mit einer klassischen Kesselschlacht anzugreifen. Die Wehrmacht bereitete mit 700.000 Soldaten, 2.500 Panzern~~,~~(no comma, the rule is: ""und"" replaces the comma) und 7.000 Geschützen ihren Angriff vor.

Der sowjetische Geheimdienst warnte die Militärführer vor der kommenden deutschen Offensive. Marschall Konstantin Rokossowski und Generaloberst Nikolai Watutin wurde der Befehl gegeben, Kursk zu verteidigen. Die Sowjets hatten gewaltige und komplizierte Wehranlagen errichtet, bestehend aus Bunkern, Schützengräben und über 400.000 Landminen, die von fast 2.000.000 Soldaten, 5.000 Panzern und 30.000 Geschützen verteidigt wurden.

Als die Schlacht begann, wurde das XLVII Korps der 9. Armee schon 9 km jenseits der Grenze aufgehalten. Minenfelder zusammen mit der Zähigkeit der sowjetischen Soldaten konnten ~~sie~~ **es** (because you are refering to ""das Korps"", if you don't want that you can replace sie/es with *die feindlichen Soldaten* or something like that) zurückhalten.

Die Panzerarmee von Generaloberst Hoth an der Südflanke war erfolgreicher im Kampf gegen die 6. Gardenpanzerarmee. Sie führten einen Angriff mit enger Speerspitze und eroberten die Städte Butovo, Gertsovka~~,~~ (no comma) und Mikhailovka. Die drei Divisionen des II. SS Panzerkorps – SS Panzergrenadier Division Liebstandarte Adolf Hitler, 2. SS Panzergrenadier Das Reich, und die 3. SS Panzergrenadier Division Totenkopf - schoben sich weit in die sowjetischen Verbände hinein.

SS-Gruppenführer Paul Hausser leitete sein II. Panzerkorps an, das Dorf von Prochorowka am Morgen des 12. Juli zu besetzen. Ohne die Kenntnis des II. SS Panzerkorps plante die 5. Gardenpanzerarmee einen massiven Gegenangriff. Die sowjetischen Panzer tragen (? don't know what you mean either, can you explain in English?) Infanterie angegriffen und überraschten die deutsche**n** Soldaten. Als der Nachmittag anbrach, war der sowjetische Panzerangriff zwar gescheitert, hatte aber einen deutschen Durchbruch nach Prochorowka gestoppt.

Hitler brach das Unternehmen Zitadelle vier Tage nach der Schlacht von Prochorowka ab. Die Alliierten waren in Sizilien gelandet und die Wehrmacht musste Truppen von der Ostfront abziehen. Das Ende der Schlacht wurde von zwei großen sowjetischen Gegenoffensiven zum Norden und Süden des Kursker Bogen begleitet.

Erstmals im Krieg hatten die Sowjets eine Großoffensive am Durchbruch gehindert. Die Rote Armee verlor 863.000 Soldaten und über 1.000 Panzer. Die Deutschen verloren etwa 305.000 Soldaten und 700 Panzer.

Von diesem Punkt ~~im Krieg~~ an hatten die Deutschen im Krieg (various positions possible, but the ""von diesem Punkt an"" is a common expression/idiom that sounds weird when interrupted by something else) nie wieder die Initiative. Sie konnten sich nur zurückziehen, bis zur schicksalshaften Schlacht um Berlin.

**Grob zusammengefasst**

Absatz 1, Satz 1 und 2 sagen dass man Steuern und Sozialabgaben vom Einkommen abziehen darf (Netto statt Brutto).  
Absatz 1, Satz 3 und 4 sagen dass man Pflichtversicherungen (KfZ Versicherung z.B.) und extrem sinnvolle Versicherungen (private Altersvorsorge bei nicht gesetzlich versicherten z.B.) abziehen darf.  
Absatz 1, Satz 5 sagt dass man Kosten zur Ausübung der Arbeit absetzen darf (Pendelkosten, Berufskleidung, etc.).  
Absatz 1, Satz 6 sagt dass in Absatz 3 noch ein paar Freibeträge stehen.  
Absatz 1, Satz 7 sagt dass Unterhaltszahlungen auch nicht angerechnet werden (Kindesunterhalt, Ehegattenunterhalt etc. pp.).  
Absatz 1, Satz 8 befreit Unterhaltsleistungen nach BAFöG, soweit ich das verstehe.

Absatz 2 beschäftigt sich mit diversen Sonderfällen die diese Rechnung nicht betreffen.

Absatz 3 ist das eigentlich interessante. Laut diesem werden vom bereinigten Erwerbseinkommen (= Lohn oder Gehalt abzüglich des Zeugs aus Absatz 1) folgende Anteile nicht berücksichtigt:

* Die ersten 100 € vollständig
* Vom Verdienst zwischen 100 und 1.000 € 20 %
* Vom Verdienst zwischen 1.000 und 1.200 € 10%, es sei denn man hat minderjährige Kinder im Haushalt, dann zwischen 1.000 und 1.500 €

**Die Rechnung**

Unser Aufstocker verdient also 1.428 €, von denen nach Satz 1, Absatz 1 und 2 die Lohnnebenkosten und Einkommenssteuer abgezogen werden. Es verbleiben 1.059 €. Ich gehe davon aus dass unser Arbeitnehmer keinen anderen Freibetrag nach Absatz 1 geltend macht, also bleibt es dabei. Von den 1.059 € verbleiben nun:

* Die ersten 100 € vollständig
* 20% vom Verdienst zwischen 100 und 1.000 € (900 € * 0,2 = 180 €)
* 10% vom Verdienst zwischen 1.000 und 1.059 € (59 € * 0,1 ~ 6 €)

Vom ALG II Anspruch (851 €) wird das Einkommen abgezogen (1.059 €) und die Freibeträge addiert (286 €). Formelhaft:

ALG II - Einkommen + Freibeträge

Falls das unverständlich aussieht kann man die Formel folgendermaßen umstellen:

ALG II - (Einkommen - Freibeträge)

Setzt man die Werte von oben ein, ergibt sich folgendes:

851 € - ( 1.059 € - 286 € ) = 851 € - 773 € = 78 €

Das ist die Aufstockung die der Arbeitnehmer von der ARGE erhalten würde.

I live there but I'm not Italian, so it sure doesn't hurt. I only know that kind of stuff from a few years of experience, I don't have the long perspective, thanks for developing.

Using cultural and historical arguments to legitimate being an autonomous political entity definitely makes sense, but if it is the only argument it is kind of weak. You can't just dwell on historical facts (8 generations is getting old) to explain what your political vision is. Most people that wave the Serenissima argument seem to be doing it to hide their xenophobia and feed their ""new things are most often bad"" mentality. It's typically what's hurting Padova at the moment, and giving people the impression it is the right way would be a terrible mistake in my opinion. I can't imagine what the Veneto could look like in 20 years if Luca Zaia was the new Doge, but good luck with making it a competitive country.

This is all fairly hypocritical given how Southern nations were treated during the debt crisis. I guess when Germany and France cant follow the rules, they just change them. That sets a far worse precedent than allowing France longer than 2015 to curb its deficit spending.

It also doesn't have a mesh topology on every level. Say, you and your neighbour have connections to a different ISP. A packet from one connection to the other is probably going to travel quite some while, generally at least to the next [IXP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_exchange_point), where your ISPs can exchange packets, and then back again. Same would generally happen with a physical letter, too.

However, it's not like you can get to everywhere just through the mesh of IXPs: If your ISP doesn't have itself a connection somewhere directly with the destination ISP, theiy also have to have a contract with people who sent your packages from one IXP to another to be able to send packages into the whole internet. This is where upstream providers come into play, they're the ISPs of ISPs. They own huge, huge pipes between important points, and can deliver data practically everywhere. If they can't do it themselves, they have contracts that allow them to send it over someone else's network.

Those people might a) be US owned, and thus dodgy, or b) even if that wasn't dodgy in itself, they could, at least occasionally, not route something via their connection from say Frankfurt to London, but, that line being clogged, go twice across the Atlantic as that pipe happens to be free at the time.",0,1396895105,null,0,false,0,cgmfovg,t3_22f6lc,t1_cgmfovg,t1_cgmb2bk,null,1433250452,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

true,Aemilius_Paulus,RUSS,Russia,"&gt;I kind of thought that was his game plan in Crimea to begin with. First he'd occupy it, only to magnanimously give it back to Ukraine under very favorable terms (for Russia), but keeping those pro-Russian voters within Ukraine. Now I don't know anymore.

Hehe, if you thought that, then you really lack a perspective of someone who has lived in both Russia and Ukraine :P Putin would never back down once having done something that big, that would make him look very bad. And he still has the pro-Russian voters within Ukraine, he never lost them. 

The idea is that he will maybe posture at the Eastern Ukrainian borders and then ease off, but posturing isn't the same thing as actually invading. He invaded Crimea, but perhaps he won't invade the East, well, most likely. Or maybe he really likes to follow Nixon's school of international diplomacy &gt;_&lt;

&gt;To be fair, I think the West recognizes this, for the most part. There is zero serious desire to expand NATO to Ukraine or Georgia. That said, Western Ukraine definitely wants to move West, not East, economically and politically. It's what precipitated this whole crisis and Russian tanks won't change that.

They do, but so much has already been done that it cannot be turned back, Putin has a victim complex coupled with an inferiority complex and with nationalism and conservatism thrown into the pot. Not a good mix. 

If you look at Georgia today, you will probably see the 'right' way to go to the West. Corruption was being cut since the Saakashvili days and now Bidzina Ivansvhili's block is still heading West, but in such a manner that still leaves a place for Russia to be an important partner. Ukraine isn't doing any of that, corruption there is significantly higher than even Russia's and their way of heading West is to tear up everything with Russia, despite Russia always having been a crucial trading partner. Stupid. 

&gt;You don't see the U.S. forcing Cuba or Venezuela to join NAFTA at gunpoint.

Cuba is a bad example, why in the world would you mention them? The blockade US has been carrying out on them is illegal according to international laws and it has been hurting Cuba rather desperately. What US did with Cuba makes Russia look good, Christ, why would you even bring that up? 

Russia is 'threatening' and Ukraine with 'economic warfare' as Yatsenyuk said, but he knows he's making empty talk because Russia is merely cutting the subsidies that Ukraine has been getting on gas prices. If fair market price is suddenly 'economic warfare' then charging money for food in restaurants is 'forced starvation in concentration camps'. 

It is interesting, however, to note that my father knows Yatsenyuk personally, he worked in UkrSotsBank in Chernivtsi in the 90s, Yatsenyuk was a big shot there. A very smart, educated fella who is rather amusingly hiding his Jewish upbringing lest his antisemitic voter base of Western Ukrainians turns against him...

It's because my ancestors came from Westphalia to the United States in the 1850's and lived in the Midwest while their ancestors came against their will as slaves sometime between ~1600 to ~1830. Our country has also struggled immensely with racism until relatively recently, and it has affected us. White people stuck with other whites, blacks with blacks, and so forth. It wasn't long ago that even amongst whites people divided along Irish, Polish, Italian, and German lines. People segregated whether consciously, against their will, or unconsciously, and it affected how our cultures developed. It's no different from Flemings living north of the Walloons, so they developed different cultures.

There's a noticeable difference between Americans from the East Coast, West Coast, South, and Midwest. That's not racist, it's just how life works. 

In American cities and social situations, blacks and whites tend to stay with others of their race. It may be unfortunate, but something in our culture drives people to ""stay with their own."" Because of this, there are cultural norms unique to African American communities and unique to white communities. The dividing line between cultures is often blurred - nowadays there are fewer neighborhoods with strictly one race, so in those areas cultures are blending. But there are still *real* differences in culture between most black people and most white people.

Look up ""ebonics."" It's a sort of accent unique to most African Americans to varying degrees. That's not racist, it's just how it is.

Yes, there are white and black ""exceptions"" to culture - I know plenty of white people who speak in a way similar to ebonics and plenty of black people who speak English the way most white people do.

It's sort of like Gypsies in Europe. They have a different culture - it's not based on their race, but it *does* exist, and it comes from having a distinct heritage (and having intense racism in centuries past).

- They have weapons of mass destruction. Really, where?

- I think there (shows a dot on the map; two days after another dot; another two days later another dot etc.)

Default of the borrower

(1)To the extent that the borrower is in default in making payments owed on the basis of the consumer loan contract he must pay interest under section 288 (1) on the amount owed. In an individual case, the lender may prove that the damage was greater or the borrower may prove that the damage was less.

(2)Interest incurred after default has occurred must be booked to a separate account and may not be paid into a current account together with the amount owed or other claims of the lender. In regard to such interest, section 289 sentence 2 applies, with the proviso that the lender may only demand damages up to the amount of the statutory rate of interest (section 246).

(3)Payments by the borrower which are insufficient to repay the entire debt due are credited, notwithstanding section 367 (1), first, towards costs of litigation, then towards the remainder of the amount owed (subsection (1)) and finally towards interest (subsection (2)). The lender may not reject instalments. **Limitation of the claims for repayment of the loan and interest is suspended from the date when default begins under subsection (1) until they are determined in a manner described in section 197 (1) nos. 3 to 5, but not for more than ten years from the date when they come into existence.** Section 197 (2) does not apply to claims for interest.

But you must to keep in mind that beyond Polish vision of the purpose of the NATO, there are at least 4 other position about NATO raison d'etre:

1. USA's: NATO is a policy tool to keep EU in somewhat subjugated position, encircled Russia (so it will not get any funny ideas) etc.

2. Western Europe's NATO... why do we need that? Wars are over... may be we should dismantle it eventually

3. Eastern Europe's NATO ? Cool, we'll get protected from Russians, they ~~weak~~ sort of civilized now, but still just in case, let's get in

4. Russia's: NATO promised us not to expand, now they do, and what a hell against whom do they need ant-missile shield over Europe? They are lying and encircling us, we need to resist

I worded poorly this part:
&gt; So while these countries did join (on their own accord??)

While Eastern Europe joined willingly, the master plan was there all along (should USA for some reason be unwilling to expand.... no amount of desire on the Eastern Europeans part would change anything)

Realistically, the only country that could resist Russia now by itself (at least for some time) is Poland. The rest of the expansion is not spending and realistically are just possible liability. Poland though understands that by itself it is not enough (and I guess you guys remember British-French guarantees of 1939) so Poland pushes through Visegrad battle group formation. 

&gt; To recap my main point: NATO expansion is not against Russia, unless being immune to military bullying by Russia is considered to be against Russia's interests.

I do believe that this is a valid vision by Poles (as I said there most likely is a bunch of other reasons for NATO actions), but Russia (feeling lied-to, betrayed and encircled) wish to take no risks. So this god-damned anti-missile shield Poland wish so badly, was/is never seen as an insurance for Poland, but as an encircling by NATO.

My best guess is.. after current Russia's expansion will stop, they will collapse after some time under burden of administering all these territories.

Also, US did plenty of its land-grabbing and also ethnic cleansing of the natives, something which Russia never did (in fact, they weren't even forced to assimilate). But that's besides the point, arguing pre-20th century history is silly, both nations have heaps of dirt.

Russia has a lot of energy reserves, a large landmass and still a more capable military than China, although that is quickly changing. That's not the point though, I don't care what you think of Russia's power rating and personally, I don't care either, I am not about to measure dicks, knowing full well that ours isn't exactly up right now. But the point is that Russia is still a power. EU isn't unified enough to create the foreign policy impact it deserves. US and Russia and China are the three primary players in this multipolar world. 

Of course, US is the most powerful by far, China and Russia don't compare. China is also far too dependent on the US to risk conflict with it.  And Russia just isn't growing like China is, so its power will only recede in the coming years. But Russia still feels that it should have a buffer zone, you cannot get around that point and tell it that it cannot have it when Russia still has the military force to demand it.

Dans la région, c'est quand même trop vrai.  P.e. la France est aussi accusée d'avoir soutenu le génocide des Hutus par les Tutsis au Burundi en 72; et je peux garantir que ce génocide était dans tous les esprits au Rwanda en 93 quand le président -- Hutu -- Melchior Ndadaye a été assassiné par sa garde tutsie, entrainant la fuite vers le Rwanda d'un certain nombre de réfugiés hutus, compliquant la situation au Rwanda qui avait déjà une bonne partie de sa population -- on parlait d'un million de personne à l'époque -- déplacée, des Hutus fuyant le FPR qui arrivait du nord et des Tutsis fuyant à la fois le FPR et les Hutus se vengeant sur eux -- il y avait déjà des massacres locaux en 93.

A ce sujet, je me souviens d'un Tutsi qui m'avait dit en substance ""pour le FPR, nous [les Tutsis restés au Rwanda] sommes des traitres et ils veulent nous faire massacrer par les Hutus, pour les Hutus, nous sommes la cinquième colonne du FPR"".  L'idée étant dans l'air du temps dans le milieu que je fréquentais, j'ai jamais su si ça correspondait à réellement à son analyse ou s'il me disait ce qu'il pensait que je voulais entendre.

Now I do realize that this is the right sector who is shouting this but there are many supporters with the same kind of view that I encountered.

About the false information spreading everywhere... 
First of all I dont watch Russian TV. What I do is read reddit, publics in VK, pikabu and besides that various news sites and this is the picture that I get:
Both sides (Russia/Ukraine) are lying, twisting facts, change the perspective like there is no tomorrow. Lets take the Євромайдан Україна in VK for example. There is so much false or not confirmed information about ridiculous statements and actions thats its getting hilarous to watch. Again, its not just the Ukraine side spreading misinformation in their favor.

But the picture that I got from all of this is that a lot of people participated in the Maidan to get rid of the corrupt government they were so sick off. This was accompanied with provocations, sniper fire from **unconfirmed** side and a bloodbath. Now groups, among them the Right Sector, used this oppurtinity to gain leverage in the government and assign their own ministers and deputys.
I do not recognize(as Obama likes to say) this to be legitimate. There was somewhere a nice youtube video of the VR where a woman was bringing up some good points about how the new government is acting wrong but was instead just booed and shout down.

true,Bezbojnicul,ROMA,Internetistan,"&gt;Once again, being Roma is fine, but statistics can't just be overlooked just because it doesn't sound good to these ""ultra-modern, cosmopolitan"" people who have never interacted with Roma people in their lives.

People are not arguing about statistics. Most people aknowledge that criminality is higher among the Roma than the general population. What people argue about is other factors and their influence on the situation. Things like the effect of past injustices, family cohesion and family values, policy and its effectiveness, degree of assimilation possible and desirable, livel of education, poverty, explicit and implicit racism and so on, and how all this shit fits together.

&gt;But being poor does not excuse theft.

Again, I don't think people try to excuse things, as much focus on larger group dynamics rather than simple individual personal responsibility. Sure, punish a thief, but when one group of people has a higher criminality rate, the question arises if the explanation for that is largely internal to that group or largely external. People who focus on external factors are often accused of making up excuses.

&gt;I will: as far as Hungary is concerned, 9 out of 10 cases of violent crimes are committed by Roma people. It's a statistic, not something that can be argued.

Since it's statistic, do you have some source?

&gt;This author should move to the eastern border regions of Hungary for a year, then we'd see how different this article would look.

How bad is the situation there? Any comprehensive articles on the issue? Also, I'd be interested to some statistics that compare criminality in western Hungary to that in Eastern (so I can further compare to Western Romania, where I live).",0,1396901065,null,0,false,0,cgmiryz,t3_22fuog,t1_cgmiryz,t1_cgmhvfg,null,1433251973,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

They have not killed or even attacked a single person for being Russian, or especially for speaking Russian (I explained the ridiculousness of the latter in a previous post). A few dozen people sang a song about moskali. If this is what you notice among the many things happening in Kiev these days, including tons of gestures of friendliness on Maidan towards like-minded Russians, some of whom came to Maidan, you have a very serious case of tunnel vision.

&gt;Thats wrong and not justified. Just imagine people in Germany/America etc. jumping around and shouting:""We are not Jews/French/Polish etc."")

There are **tons** of such instances, including far-right marches, in every country you mentioned (Germany, France, the US, Poland, etc.). There are such marches in Russia, but I do not have a burning desire to request that anyone save the non-Russian population there. That is because I understand how small a minority those people are in their countries. Except Russia, where racist killings are commonplace enough that an Indian friend of mine studying in Moscow does not leave his dorm on soccer match days, because that's when the neo-Nazis are on the hunt for ""chornye"".

Of course that is all wrong, but it does not make the governments of those countries illegitimate. Likewise, none of the people in these videos are in power.

&gt;Now I do realize that this is the right sector who is shouting this but there are many supporters with the same kind of view that I encountered.

Where did you encounter them? Was it in person and if so, please provide some context.

&gt; I do not recognize(as Obama likes to say) this to be legitimate.

That's your right. There are still plenty of people who do not recognize the dissolution of the USSR to be legitimate. Heck, there are even people who do not yet accept the outcome of the US Civil War.

true,boskee,UKGB,PLUK,"&gt; 1. Polish doesn’t have a word for “years”.  Now a Polish person will argue with you that they do, namely “lata” and that “rok” is the singular (i.e. “year”).  But lata is in fact the plural form of “summer” – “lato”. Therefore if you want to say “3 years ago” the Polish is “3 lata temu”, and if you want to say “3 summers ago” the Polish is also “3 lata temu”.  As you can see there is no distinction.

&gt; 2. Polish doesn’t have a word for “sleet”.  It strikes me as very odd given that Polish winters can be very cold and snowy that they don’t have a word for “sleet”.  Instead they call it either “rain with snow” or “snow with rain”.  So when the TV weather presenter says “there will be rain, sleet and snow tonight” she has to use the awkward looking phrase “będzie deszcz, deszcz z śniegiem i śnieg wieczorem”.

How exactly has Ukraine been 'tearing up everything with Russia'. Earlier you claimed that Ukraine's government revoked the lease extension of Russia's naval base in Sevastopol ""so Russia just took the matter in its own hands"", when it was in fact RUSSIA that nullified that agreement. After invasion, occupation and annexation of Crimea Russia unilaterally denunciated the Kharkov Pact March 31. To me it seems it's Russia 'tearing up everything with Ukraine'.

&gt; Russia is merely cutting the subsidies that Ukraine has been getting on gas prices. If fair market price is suddenly 'economic warfare' then charging money for food in restaurants is 'forced starvation in concentration camps'.

The $485 is simply ridiculous price as European average Gazprom price is $380 including transit costs. Look at map and the transit distances involved and compare to the distance between Ukraine and Russia. Russia's unilateral price hike is certainly not 'fair market price', it's a silly price, and with the reverse flow Ukraine could get Gazprom gas much cheaper rerouted from the European hubs than directly from Russia.

Not really.

Most of EU defense spending goes to pensions and pay, not troop numbers or equipment.

In fact, the German Army fields a WHOPPING 280 tanks, the French field 240 tanks, the Italians have 240 or so, and the British have 300.

The RUssains have 2,000 on active duty, and another 5,000 on reserve.

Most EU militaries are tiny, having devolved into Infantry only armies barely better than paper tigers.

*Don't get me started*. Scrissi dei lunghi post qua tempo fa. Sono andato indietro nella mia cronologia ma non riesco ad andare oltre 4 mesi fa, quindi cerco di farla il più breve possibile.

Per dirne una: rifarsi a di Giordano Bruno come figura di riferimento, il quale si rivolterebbe nella tomba, perché tutto era fuorché ateo, vuol dire o essere ignoranti della complessità del personaggio, e/o essere incoerenti.

Poi prendi l'intervista di Augias a Odifreddi, la trovi su youtube: lì quest'ultimo parla a sproposito di cose che non sa con una sicumera che mi lascia basito.

Tipo questo ""ragionamento"": l'ultimo capitolo di Marco parla della resurrezione, ma siccome è un'aggiunta successiva, allora Gesù non è mai esistito. È ridicolo, ma ciò che dice è proprio quello: una frase con errori madornali, sia fattuali, sia di logica elementare.

Errori fattuali: l'ultimo capitolo di Marco è vero che è un'aggiunta successiva, e non è un mistero, è una cosa che si sa; il fatto è che non parla della resurrezione!

Errori di logica elementare: anche se fosse (ammesso e non concesso) come dice lui, ciò non è automaticamente una prova che gli avvenimenti narrati siano inventati. E non faccio un discorso di fede, questo ragionamento si applica a qualsiasi testo.

Il primo errore denota, nel migliore dei casi, estrema superficialità, tant'è che basta leggerlo, anche in italiano, per rendersi conto che non si parla della resurrezione; nel peggiore dei casi, invece, è malafede.

Il secondo errore, di logica elementare, compiuto da uno che la logica la insegna all'università, beh, mi fa tendere decisamente alla malafede, perché, per quanto non lo stimi affatto, non penso sia così incompetente, lo spero per lui.

&gt;Perche' in linea di massima sono fra i pochi che mi stanno ancora simpatici.

Eh allora mi sa che dovrai eliminarli dalla lista. Di loro, personalmente, non mi fido: non sono quello che dicono di essere, cioè razionalisti, ma hanno delle motivazioni IMHO puramente anticlericali/politiche e che sono per loro più importanti dell'obiettività e della razionalità.

Poi magari ci sono persone serie, visto che generalizzare è sempre sbagliato, ma i loro portavoce dànno impressioni veramente pessime.

Well I'm glad you admitted as much, it takes an honest person to do so. I just don't understand how you could draw the conclusions you drew, given the many thousands of hours of footage available for viewing and the many articles from neutral sources describing in detail what took place on Maidan. You took away those three videos of a few dozen far-right idiots shouting something about killing ""moskals"" - what a wonderful illustration of selection bias.

Well, she has valid points, but it is important to view this in context. She is an MP of the president's party, which is why other MPs are chanting ""murderers"" (plural). They bear the lion's share of responsibility for the fact that Crimeans were afraid of these mythical ""banderivtsi"" that never came, a fear which was exploited cynically by Russia (don't forget that opinion polls placed support for joining Russia at 42% in early February, and leave aside the fact that no legitimate referendum actually took place). So I do not approve of shouting anyone down in parliament (though unfortunately it happens in all parliaments), but calling politicians from that particular party ""murderers"" I cannot object to - they do have blood on their hands for not stopping Yanukovych before he ordered the full-scale massacre.

##LA MIRABOLANTE STORIA DELLA PATATA

# LA NOIA

Martedì grasso dei primi anni 2000. Io e tre coinquilini, che per rispettare la privacy chiameremo il Metallaro, Rocco, e TP (noto vip del punk italiano) passiamo una serata noiosissima in casa guardando fiction. Neppure una bottiglia di vino. Niente. Noia totale. Palla de fieno che rotola.

Le vicine di casa, dirimpettaie di finestra, invece fanno festa per il carnevale. YEAH YEAH tutte mascherate con i loro amici vanno verso piazza maggiore a festeggiare non si sa cosa. Questo innervosisce non poco il mio coinquilino Metallaro, che affacciandosi alla finestra decide per scorno di lanciare loro una cipolla. Purtroppo il lancio non va a buon fine, e non solo non le colpisce, ma loro manco se lo cagano perché non si accorgono di niente. Scorno.

Niente. Palla di fieno, e guardiamo la fiction di canale 5, che non so ma forse era Ultimo con Raoul Bova. Noia totale. Misantropia.
Alle una sentiamo per strada i rumori dell’allegra combriccola mascherata delle coinquiline del cazzo che ritornano dal loro festeggiare non si sa cosa con un buonumore non si sa perché, e l’infastidimento precedentemente manifestatosi con la cipolla si ripalesa ma di grado estremamente superiore. Dunque il Metallaro dice “tiriamogli qualcosa”, ma mentre Rocco cerca un oggetto qualsiasi, la carovana già è entrata nel portone davanti al nostro e sta già salendo le scale verso casa.

# L’IRREPARABILE

Cazzo, frustrazione. Ma: ecco che il Metallaro si pone a cavalcioni del davanzale della finestra della cucina (rischiando la vita, secondo piano, 60% del corpo fuori dalla finestra sullo strapiombo) mentre io ho trovato nella credenza una patata di all’incirca 1 kg con le dimensioni di un grosso sasso.

Porgo la patata al Metallaro, ignaro di quello che sta per succedere.

Le vicine entrano in casa, si vede dalla finestra accendersi la luce.

Il Metallaro scaglia con una potenza inaudita a 200 km all’ora la patata-sasso che frantuma il vetro della finestra delle vicine facendo schizzare tutti i vetri sulla parete opposta.

Il gelo.

TP guarda con occhi pallati Rocco.

E’ immediata la consapevolezza di doversi ritirare dalla cucina, spengendo la luce, fuggendo in un'altra stanza per decidere il da farsi.

#IL SUMMIT

La riunione al buio del corridoio verte su due punti: la paranoia di aver ucciso qualcuno e la necessità di mantenere una linea di difesa da qui all’eternità dei tempi, senza contraddizioni.

La paranoia si basa sulla certezza che arriveranno le teste di cuoio e verremo incarcerati per mille anni come pena esemplare per scoraggiare eventuali imitatori di chi ha inventato il fenomeno teppistico del 2000, cioè (dopo i sassi dal cavalcavia) la patata nella finestra senza alcun motivo.

Per la strategia di difesa, decidiamo all’unanimità di non confessare e di negare l’evidenza in stile noi non abbiamo fatto niente, maccosa io dormivo. E’ altresì vero che possiamo essere stati solo noi a lanciare la patata, in quanto davanti alla finestra delle vicine c’è solo la nostra finestra e quella di una vecchia di 89 anni, e che per sfondare un vetro dalla strada ci sarebbe voluto Hulk sbronzo che però dà il giro all’ortaggio facendogli compiere una traiettoria balisticamente improbabile attorno ad un albero con caratteristiche da medaglia d’oro delle olimpiadi, per violenza e parabola.

E’ necessario intanto chiudere la finestra della cucina che è rimasta aperta: Rocco striscia come un marine in cucina al buio e con manine segrete chiude le persiane, peccato che ovviamente se c’era qualcuno affacciato di fronte avrebbe visto una stanza buia vuota con due manine spuntate non si sa da dove che chiudono le persiane pianissimo. E’ necessario in secondo luogo nascondere sotto le coperte il coinquilino TP che già suda senso di colpa dagli occhi, essendo incapace di fare cose che comportino malafede.

Ma soprattutto è necessario, per dindirindina, nascondere l’arma del delitto, in questo caso TUTTE le patate presenti nell’appartamento, ma la modalità con cui farlo è discutibile. E viene discusso, sottovoce in una tempesta di paranoie:

1. mangiamo tutte le patate? No, se entrano le teste di cuoio ci trovano all’una e mezza di notte che mangiamo 5 chili di patate ci colgono in flagrante
2. nascondiamo le patate nelle giacche negli armadi? No, in caso di perquisa delle forze dell’ordine saremmo parimenti spacciati.
3. nascondiamo le patate nelle buche delle chitarre e rimontiamo le corde? Maccosa.
4. diamo la colpa alla vecchia di 89 anni lasciando il sacco di patate fuori dal suo pianerottolo? Non credo che i Ris di Parma ci cascherebbero.
5. buttiamo le patate nel water?
La mozione e) sembra a tutti la più convincente. Solo che le patate non vanno giù nel water, ci tocca tagliarle a pezzi sulla lavatrice, ma ancora non vanno giù, non passano dallo scarico. Cristo.

# LA SOLUZIONE

E’ evidente: tutte le patate debbono essere sbucciate velocemente sulla lavatrice, masticate una ad una crude per essere ammorbidite, dopodichè sputate nel cesso e tirare l’acqua. E così viene fatto, io, Rocco, il Metallaro e TP (nel panico) mastichiamo le patate e le sputiamo nel cesso fino alla nausea, certi che questa sia la mossa migliore per passarla liscia con quelli di C.S.I. che stanno arrivando.
Purtroppo, giunti a due patate dalla fine, dobbiamo arrenderci allo schifo e decidiamo di nascondere le ultime due prove della nostra colpevolezza. Ma dove?

#L’IGUANA

Al tempo un nostro coinquilino abruzzese (quel giorno assente) possedeva un’ iguana che viveva in un televisore svuotato adibito a ternario, da cui il nome della bestia era Grundig. Non stupitevi, aveva i rasta. (Il coinquilino, non l’iguana). Noi comunque decidiamo che le ultime due patate vanno nascoste dietro al tronco di legno dove dorme Grundig, e cosi facciamo.
Ecco fatto, adesso è il momento della fase b, cioè mettersi a letto e simulare di stare dormendo dalle ore 21. Io divido la camera con l’inquilino TP, che trovo mummificato e sudante sotto le coperte, non proferisce parola e sta già pensando al pigiama per il carcere. Passiamo qualche minuto a immaginarci il clamore mediatico di questo nostro gesto, e i commenti di Umberto Galimberti su questa gioventù priva di valori. Passiamo qualche altro minuto a temere l’imminente arrivo delle teste di cuoio.
Quand’ecco.

# IL NAPOLETANO

Dlin dlon.

Suona il campanello. Sono ormai le due e un quarto. Vado in pigiama a chiedere “chi è”, simulando di essere stato svegliato. “siamo le ragazze, le vicine di fronte”. Argh. Apro. Entrano due ragazze e un tipo vestito militare, taglio parà, accento direi partenopeo.
“Che è successo?” dico stropicciandomi gli occhi dal sonno. Arrivano anche Rocco e il Metallaro, TP rimane nella cripta.
“Ci hanno sfondato una finestra con una patata”

“Eeeeh?”

Simuliamo incredulità. Forse siamo davvero increduli, il gesto che abbiamo fatto è effettivamente incredibilmente senza senso. Iniziamo a sproloquiare cose tipo “Ma chi è stato? E soprattutto perché? Ma potevano uccidervi! Ma è assurdo! C’era qualche messaggio con la patata? Avete dei nemici? Noi troveremo i colpevoli! Ma soprattutto: che senso ha tirare una patata in una finestra” eccetera.
Facce a culo così, viste poche volte nella vita. Diamo loro anche del cartone da imballaggio per coprire la finestra. Il napoletano non è tanto convinto, noi siamo anche un po’ offesi perché hanno pensato a noi come colpevoli, dato che facendo tutte le ipotesi del caso, potremmo essere stati solo noi.

Le salutiamo raccomandandoci di tenerci informati su questo incredibile caso.

Passa mezz’ora, e verso le 3 suona il campanello.

Rocco chiede al citofono chi è, ma una voce già di qua dalla porta dice “apra: carabinieri”

Argh.

Entrano due carabinieri, uno che fa le domande e uno che si guarda attorno (secondo noi cerca tracce di patate) prendendo appunti. Noi aggrediamo subito:

“Agenti venite per quella cosa della patata? E’ una cosa incredibile, assurda, ma chi può essere stato?”

“Ehm, ragazzi.. c’è stata una festa qui stasera?”

iniziano a cercare tracce di spinelli, bottiglie di vino o resti di festeggiamenti e baldoria.

Non c’è niente.

Niente.

Sono basiti, vedono solo 4 stolti in pigiama che si arrampicano sugli specchi, ma non hanno prove. Vedono anche tanti poster dei Dimmu Borgir e degli Immortal. Il Metallaro è amico di Attila Cshar dei Mayem. Proviamo con la tattica “In effetti possiamo esere stati solo noi: ma agente, mi dica: per quale motivo? Non c’è alcun motivo sensato per un gesto del genere!”

Era vero.

Il Metallaro tira fuori a questo punto la perla:

“Vede, agente, in questo quartiere succedono cose strane. Pensi che l’altra settimana qualcuno ha lanciato un portacenere a della gente che cenava sul balcone. Incredibile, no?”

Era stato lui.

I carabinieri se ne vanno. Li sentiamo dalla finestra dire alle ragazze, in strada, qualcosa tipo “Possono essere stati solo loro, ma non c’è traccia di niente”.

Passa la nottata, con sogni strani a base di tribunali e inquisizioni. TP è immobile. Gli provo la febbre, ha 31°. E’ ormai di marmo.

#IL GIORNO DOPO

Nessuno crede di averla scampata. Usciamo di casa dopo ore di tentennamenti, ma usciamo a scaglioni e tutti con gli occhiali scuri. Io e il Metallaro, in un bar, vediamo avvicinarsi due poliziotti.
Ansia.

Penso alla fuga modello tetti di palazzi in film americani.

I poliziotti ordinano un cappuccino.

# L’IGUANA 2

Torno a casa, verso sera suona il campanello. Sono di nuovo le ragazze. Argh.

“Siamo venute a SCUSARCI per ieri. Vi abbiamo dato la colpa subito, ma voi siete stati cosi gentili verso di noi. Non capiamo chi possa essere stato, ma vi volevamo invitare a cena per scusarci.”

Ah-ah. Il crimine paga.

Arrogantemente, mi dichiaro un po’ offeso ma so perdonare, e gli mostro la nostra casa.

“venite di qua, vi mostro la nostra iguana Grundig”

Musica di Simonetti.

Spunta una patata da sotto il tronco.

Prendo di forza le ragazze per il braccio, le trascino via dalla stanza dell’iguana, e dico

“Ma no, venite di qua: vi mostro la cucina.”

true,[deleted],null,null,"BERLIN—German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is quietly pursuing a more conciliatory course with Russia, a shift that reflects a strategy to protect national business interests and assuage a public increasingly wary of antagonizing Moscow.

While continuing to warn Russian President Vladimir Putin against threatening Ukraine, Ms. Merkel—who earlier said Russia could face massive political and economic damage for its annexation of Crimea—is now emphasizing the need for more dialogue with the Kremlin.

In recent days, the German leader and other senior government officials have repeatedly stressed that de-escalating tensions with Russia, rather than provoking it with a more forceful response, is their top priority. Berlin has also pushed back on pressure from Poland and other Eastern European countries to station more North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops along the security alliance's eastern flank. And German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he saw no way for Ukraine to join NATO.

""I work every day to ensure that we continue to speak with Russia,"" Ms. Merkel told a meeting of her conservative party over the weekend.

On Monday, Ms. Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said it was disappointing that Mr. Putin hadn't withdrawn Russian troops from the Ukrainian border as he had pledged to do during a phone call with the chancellor last week. In response to the latest tensions in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Seibert said all parties needed to avoid a further escalation.

The chancellor's stern rhetoric earlier in the crisis was heralded in Europe's capitals as a sign that Germany was finally asserting its regional leadership and willing to risk its decadeslong rapprochement with Moscow.

Berlin's softer approach suggests that Ms. Merkel may not be ready to heed calls for Germany to take on a more forceful role in international affairs and will instead maintain the country's reliance on the U.S. to take the lead.

Before the Ukraine crisis, several prominent German leaders, including President Joachim Gauck, said Germany needed to move beyond the shadow of World War II and assume more global responsibility. In a landmark January speech, Mr. Gauck called on Germany ""to do more for the security that others have guaranteed for decades.""

German leaders were caught off guard by Russia's willingness to use military might to achieve its strategic aims in Ukraine. That miscalculation, German political observers say, unnerved the German public and helps explain Berlin's realignment of its strategy.

""This response is reflexive rather than reasoned,"" says Josef Joffe, co-publisher of German weekly Die Zeit and a senior fellow at Stanford University. ""There is a permanent détente impulse built into German foreign policy."" ""

That impulse was born out of West Germany's so-called Ostpolitik, a strategy of engagement with the Eastern Bloc that began in the late 1960s. Many Germans believe those policies, first championed by Social Democrat Chancellor Willy Brandt, helped prevent an armed confrontation with the Soviet Union and allowed for German reunification.

That legacy is one reason all three of Ms. Merkel's living predecessors as chancellor— Helmut Schmidt and Gerhard Schröder of the Social Democrats and Helmut Kohl of her own Christian Democrats—have expressed sympathy for Russia's actions.

""There's been a lack of sensitivity in dealing with our Russian neighbor, especially President Putin,"" Mr. Kohl said in an interview the German daily Bild last month.

When Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, one of the more conservative members of Ms. Merkel's cabinet, recently compared Mr. Putin's Crimean move to Hitler's invasion of the Sudetenland, he was attacked by politicians of all stripes who accused him of destabilizing Germany's relationship with Russia.

Even Ms. Merkel distanced herself from her senior minister, saying that the she viewed the Crimean situation as a ""singular event.""

As much of Europe has focused in recent days on what steps to take if Russia refuses to withdraw its troops from the Ukraine border, Germany has debated whether Mr. Schäuble's comments went too far.

""We've gotten caught up in navel gazing,"" says Joerg Forbrig, a senior program officer in Berlin with the German Marshall Fund, a think tank. ""We've lost sight of the issues at hand.""

Polls suggest most Germans want their country to maintain equal distance between Russia and the West and act as a mediator. Yet most believe Ms. Merkel has firmly aligned Germany with the West, according to a poll released last week by infratest dimap. More than 60% of Germans surveyed oppose sending the country's air force to strengthen NATO's eastern borders, the poll found.

The German public's aversion to confronting Russia is one reason for Ms. Merkel's change of course. The other is business.

In addition to Germany's reliance on Russian gas, many of the country's blue-chip companies, from Siemens AG SIE.XE -2.50%  to Volkswagen AG VOW3.XE -1.04% have major investment in Russia. Though Germany's overall trade with Russia is fairly modest—Russia accounts for just 3% of overall exports—the companies active there count among Germany's most influential.

Within days of Crimea's annexation, Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser visited Mr. Putin at his official residence outside of Moscow and stressed the importance of Germany's economic ties with Russia. The public visit, which Mr. Kaeser said Ms. Merkel's office was informed about, was seen as an attempt to signal to Russia that commercial ties needn't suffer amid what the Siemens chief characterized as ""temporary turbulence.""

The head of Deutsche Bahn AG, Germany's state-owned railway, Rüdiger Grube, is also planning a trip to Russia. Deutsche Bahn, which has large freight and logistics arms, does a lot of business with Russia's state railway.

""For us, the top priority is de-escalation,"" Mr. Grube said at a recent news conference.

The chief executives of Adidas AG, Thyssen-Krupp AG TKA.XE -2.01%  and DHL parent Deutsche Post AG DPW.XE -2.72%  have all recently criticized the West's handling of the Ukraine crisis, arguing that Mr. Putin was forced into a corner. All three companies have substantial operations in Russia.

Ms. Merkel's supporters argue that she has succeeded in striking a balance between protecting German interests and meeting its international obligations within the European Union and NATO.

Wolfgang Ischinger, the head of the Munich Security Conference and a lobbyist for insurance giant Allianz SE, ALV.XE -1.86%  rejects the criticism leveled at Germany by Arizona Sen. John McCain and others who have chided Berlin for being too soft on Russia.

""We are by far the country that would suffer the most"" from a worsening of the crisis, said Mr. Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the U.S. ""Not a single dollar will be lost in Arizona.""",0,1396908984,null,0,false,0,cgmmphg,t3_22gpme,t1_cgmmphg,t3_22gpme,null,1433253825,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

Because older people are dramatically less likely to emigrate.  
Also, there's big pressure for everyone to study.  

&gt;Can you cite research showing correlation between emigration and lower crime rate?

It's obviously correlated in case of Poland because crime was constantly dropping since accession to eu. But, there's no need for correlation study when there's direct causation. Unemployed people have both more time and motivation for crime. Emigration reduces unemployment. Therefore, emigration reduces crime. At the same time, unemployed people, especially long-term unemployed, are on average the most worthless parts of society.

Qu'est-ce que je déforme ? Je ne  fais que demander une citation.

Dans ce cas tu n'as qu'à citer ce qu'elle dit dans le contexte. Pourquoi tu ne le fais pas ?

Parce que tu es malhonnête, tout simplement.

&gt;Elle est assez grande pour savoir comment seront interprétés ses propos dans ce contexte.

C'est à dire ? 

Dans ton cas : ""elle s'invente une exigence des musulmans d'interdiction pour tous du porc"" ou ""il faut comprendre oui mais attention quand je dis on rétablis je dis on change rien?"". Rien de tout ça n'est dit, tu viens d'être pris en flag et tu essaies de détourner la conversation.

Ça a un nom : de la désinformation pure et simple.

Et le FN en sort grandi. Ça valide entièrement la thèse des merdias qui mentent et diffusent de la propagande anti-FN.

&gt;Sinon ta these c'est quoi?

Ma thèse c'est que ses propos sont irréprochables. Elle ne fait que répéter que la loi s'applique : ""Nous n'accepterons aucune exigence religieuse dans les menus scolaires"", et que si les maires précédents ne l'appliquaient pas, les maires FN l'appliqueront.

À aucun moment elle ne stigmatise une communauté, à aucun moment on ne force quiconque à manger du porc. Il suffit de citer ce qu'elle dit pour s'en convaincre.

I totally agree with you on the EU, also a fan of that and I oppose the eurosceptiscism, but I don't think that it is as widespread as you would think. Most politicians would only support it because they think there might be a couple of votes in it, but that number is in freefall since UKIP started taking the more right-wing voters away from the tories. Even Cameron said he would rather we stayed in the EU. The eurosceptics arent even a majority, the latest YouGov poll (and all the ones I've seen actually) show that the population has a majority pro-eu leaning. It's just that the eurosceptics are more vocal (and there was a whole thread in /r/unitedkingdom about why that is).

In an official statement giving their grounds for the acquittals, the judges emphasized that a court ordered independent expert review had discredited DNA evidence key to the prosecution case, while Knox and Sollecito's accounts failing to completely match did not constitute evidence they had given a false alibi. Discounting testimony from a homeless man who said that he had seen Knox and Sollecito out on the night of the murder as self-contradictory, the judges observed the witness was a heroin addict. Having noted that there was no evidence of any phone calls or texts between Knox or Sollecito and Guede, the judges concluded there was a ""material non-existence"" of evidence to support the guilty verdicts, and that an association among Sollecito, Knox, and Guede to commit the murder was ""far from probable"".[27][33][34] Knox returned to the US.

Elle est stupide elle ne sait pas répondre aux questions?

'Semantiquement elle est irréprochable. Le contexte ne sert a rien. a question du journaliste n'a pas été répondue et Marine Le Pen n'a jamais dit ""Je refuse toute pression de groupes religieux"" en parlant de l'absence de porc a la cantine, ni dit "" exactement"" quand on lui demande si elle changera l'état établi (qui est bien d'avoir 2 repas).

Le contexte c'est important dans une interview, c'est important dans une analyse. Tu t'acharnes a vouloir retirer le contexte, la question du journaliste parce que c'est le seul moyen pour démontrer que ""sémantiquement"" elle est irréprochable. C'est malhonnete. C'est aussi prendre les gens pour des cons. 

Maintenant plutot que d'utiliser ta tactique habituelle de ne rien vouloir démontrer en reposant tout le temps la même question sans vouloir débattre des arguments des autres, tu montres bien que tu n'as aucune réflexion personnelle. Tu ne fais que rabacher la ligne du parti. C'est bien camarade.

Just because they helped overthrow the old government doesn't give them the right to be the new one. Let wait till the new government is voted in!


&gt; Well I'm glad you admitted as much, it takes an honest person to do so. I just don't understand how you could draw the conclusions you drew, given the many thousands of hours of footage available for viewing and the many articles from neutral sources describing in detail what took place on Maidan. You took away those three videos of a few dozen far-right idiots shouting something about killing ""moskals"" - what a wonderful illustration of selection bias.


I just took these videos from a quick google search since I didnt wanted to refer to online comments who arent exactly a reliable source. I'm fully aware that this are just some extremist but they are used by foreign propaganda to paint a false picture. At this point it raises a question why they arent being reprimanded? There was this director of a TV station beaten up and the act recorded and put online and that was clearly politically motivated. Are these people arrested? If not, why?

&gt; Such shows are a dime a dozen in every country. Making fun of Paralympics? Classy. The pitiful and disgusting parroting of Moscow propaganda (5 bn dollars for revolution in Ukraine - oh wait no, that's spread out over 22 years and includes every imaginable NGO on every imaginable social issue, as well as support for independent media). Independent, my ass.

Yes this is a satirical show and doesnt show the picture from a neutral standpoint. But it points out a few things which are quite interesting. I dont know about the 22 years timespan. But since you put it as a counter i would like have the source on that. Oh and please ZDF is one of the most independent TV stations in Germany. Just because they showed something critizing the Maidan doesn't necessarely mean that they got bought by Russia.


Im not trying to force some view here. I only state things that I read and the picture which is drawn here.
