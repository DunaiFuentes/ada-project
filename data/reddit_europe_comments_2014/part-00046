Die Grenzen zwischen Kategorie 1 und 2 sind extrem fließend. So fließend, dass nicht davon auszugehen ist, dass einem Kunden schon beim bestellen  immer zwangsläufig klar sein muss, ob die Ware jetzt gerade noch unter 2 oder doch schon unter 1 fällt. 

Selbst jemand, der sich aktiv darum bemüht, sich nicht strafrechtlich relevant zu verhalten, kann das demnach niemals zu 100% sicherstellen. 

Man muss sich klar machen: 1 Bild, das unter die Kategorie 1 fällt reicht. Selbst wenn es nicht bewusst bestellt (oder zunächst fälschlich für eines der Kategorie 2 gehalten) wurde , aber halt behalten worden ist. Eine Google Suche, die auf Bilder der Kategorie 1 abzielt kann reichen. 

Ist der Gedanke, dass bei jemandem, der über verschleierte Wege Bilder von nackten Jungs bestellt, einer der obigen Fälle vorliegt wirklich so willkürlich und fernliegend? Die StPO zwingt die Staatsanwaltschaften nicht, sich künstlich dumm zu stellen. 

Das Problem ist mE nicht die konkrete Durchsuchung. Die Probleme sind das schwammige materielle Recht und die skandalös niedrigen Anforderungen, die hierzulande für extrem grundrechtsintensive Ermittlungesmaßnahmen ausreichen. 

Solange die StPO aber so ist, wie sie ist , erscheint mir ein nun mal ausreichender Anfangsverdacht sehr naheliegend. 

Das sind im Übrigen beides Felder, bei denen Herr Edathy nicht gerade durch eine besonders starke politisch Neigung zu Verbesserungen aufgefallen wäre. Eher im Gegenteil.

While the exam itself does not require academic knowledge (Fachwissen ist nicht erforderlich http://www.goethe.de/ins/de/ort/ber/prf/daf/deindex.htm), I would argue that it still tests academic aptitude to an extent because of the type of text and audio material it deals with. While they are not excessively complicated, they still require a certain amount of thought beyond linguistic skills to understand them fully. However, preparation courses and DAF books will definitely train this skill as well. It's all about taking the time to answer tricky questions and looking for clues in the text.

Portati separati in stanzette, picchiati da uno che pareva pagato per farlo (mi hanno spiegato di come entrasse tranquillo e si mettesse i guanti per picchiarti come se dovesse timbrare il cartellino).

Fatto firmare fogli senza poterli leggere (conditi con altri schiaffi).

Accusati di aver distrutto un bancomat con tanto di associazione a delinquere (o qualcosa del genere) col tedesco di cui sopra. C'era pure un testimone, che ha testimoniato per decine di casi diversi a Genova in quei giorni.

EDIT: The reality is that animals are more intelligent than we previously thought. And the idea that we can abuse them whichever way we want to, because ""they don't have souls"" or because ""god put them here for us to do whatever we want with them"" is absolutely wrong and stems from ancient, barbaric religions.

Recent research points to the fact that there are varying levels to which an animal can be concious or even self aware. Dolphins, Chimps and Elephants can recognize themselves in the mirror without fail.

EDIT2:

Both dolphins and humans begin to recognize themselves in a mirror at about the same age of 2.

It's more of an ingroup/outgroup kind of thing.

If you're around on Sunday El rastro in La latina is a cool flea market to check out. I'd recommend going to one of the markets, either Mercado de San Miguel near Plaza mayor or Mercado de San Anton in chueca for some food or drinks. 

For me, Madrid was always a place that was better to just relax and enjoy than to sightsee. Some of the cooler areas in my opinion are Malasaña (very trendy with lots of restaurants coffee shops and bars), la latina (more upscale but nice tapas restaurants) lavapies (a bit more rough or sketchy, but a great mix of cultures with good food -  Bar Melo's zapatillo may be my favorite sandwich ever) Moncloa /Arguelles (near a university area, a lot of people close to your age probably) 

I could probably go on for awhile but the best thing to do is explore, find a nice table outside in the afternoon and relax just like the madrileños do. Also, I'd recommend taking a da trip to Toledo, Ávila, or Segovia.  All can be done via bus or train.

Sì, i carabinieri che stavano chiamando. Ad ogni modo non è che quel qualcun altro fosse un Godot che arrivava da chissà dove, Benjamin lo stava tenendo.

&gt;(questo io lo chiamo fregarsene, e credo lo chiamino così tutti) 

Beh no, io lo chiamo distrarsi. Fregarsene significa essere consci che il ladro sarebbe scappato.

&gt;discutono (ma su cosa? La situazione è chiarissima) invece di agire

Non hai capito il senso del mio messaggio, perché io mi riferivo al dopo. Sto dicendo di come fregarsene significava ""andarsene senza pensarci"", se hanno gestito male una situazione però poi ci discutono sopra mi pare tutt'altro che menefreghismo.

&gt;quello che fa il gesto di trattenere il motorino, e che fino a poco prima teneva la mano mollemente adagiata sul portapacchi è lo stesso che ha aiutato lo scippatore a rimettere in piedi il motorino stesso. 

Esatto, vuol dire che PRIMA pensava fosse un povero tizio caduto e POI ha capito la situazione. 

&gt;  (sfido chiunque a dire che lo stesse trattenendo) 

Ma se fai caso ai ""ruoli"" nella vicenda, non era lui quello addetto al trattenere il motorino, era Benjamin. Lui è stato passivo perché non si aspettava che Benjamin lo lasciasse andare e infatti dopo prova un ultimo disperato tentativo per agguantarlo.

&gt;E' lo stesso, che, guarda caso, si è distratto prima. 

Stai dicendo che si è distratto di proposito? Davvero?

- [Giraffe-gate](http://i.imgur.com/6qLppAF.jpg) (yes i just named it that):

(WARNING: HEAVY SCANDINAVIAN BIAS BELOW)

Denmark took international headlines the past week when Copenhagen Zoo decided to euthanize a young giraffe named Marius. There was initially protests at home, however, after the Zoo explained the reasons for the euthanasia, protests quickly died down at home. Suddently the story gained traction abroad especially from cultures with heavy influence of puritanism (UK, USA, Canada, Australia) and thus the stage was set for the battle between Scandinavian pragmatism and English puritanism. The proests were mainly that you cannot:

1. Kill a cute giraffe humanely even though the zoo needs the resources for genetically fitter specimens.
2. Kill a cute giraffe THAT HAS A HUMAN NAME HELLO!?!?!?!
3. Dissect a giraffe in front of children: [LOOK HOW TERRIFIED AND EMOTIONALLY ABUSED THEY ARE!](http://i.imgur.com/Z1bqe49.jpg)
4. Feed the carcass to canivores. The better solution is obviously to destroy the meat and feed the lions minced beef from tubes like they do in murica.

Following articles in major english-speaking media outlets, the Copenhagen Zoo Facebook page suffered tens of thousand 1 starred reviews with [very angry comments](http://i.imgur.com/fsaSRef.jpg) from [not-so-informed people](http://i.imgur.com/vSjVCmb.jpg) wishing for the director and his staff and their children to be killed and fed to the lions (lolwut?)

Because of the wording used in the English press-release (that Marius wasn't genetically pure enough to fit in the European Breeding Programme), [Godwin's law](http://i.imgur.com/orBNmDg.png) was fulfilled in approximately 37 picoseconds.

Also unlucky staff and directors from Odense Zoo, who are completely unrelated to Copenhagen Zoo, suffered death threats from english-speaking persons.

The natural history museum in Aarhus that weekly dissects animals for educational purposes with children in the audience, also received strongly written e-mails.

After the online petition to spare the Giraffe failed, protesters soon began a petition to have Bengt Holst, the director of CPH zoo [whose channel4 interview was featured on /r/videos in the past week](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuxgAC0dWK4), fired.",0,1392546568,null,0,1392547513,0,cfgm6fa,t3_1y1w4w,t1_cfgm6fa,t3_1y1w4w,null,1432419804,51,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,51

* Former Socialist MP Gábor Simon [returned his mandate](http://www.politics.hu/20140213/simon-returns-parliamentary-mandate/) after stepping down from all political positions the previous week because of an unreported 780.000€ bank account in Austria. His [newly updated income report](http://www.politics.hu/20140210/simons-updated-asset-declaration-gives-no-answers-on-origin-of-austrian-funds-says-committee-chair/) again failed to account for the funds in question and has been playing a ridiculous hide-and-seek with journalists all week. With his mandate returned, [his case became a general tax investigation](http://www.politics.hu/20140214/detectives-visit-simons-house-and-socialist-headquarters/). He's pretty much putting his head in sand, this case got really ridiculous.

* [Orbán went to Beijing](http://english.cntv.cn/20140213/105456.shtml), scored trade deals including [one with Huawei](http://www.politics.hu/20140213/hungary-signs-agreement-with-huawei-during-chinese-visit/), but the more important part was the discussions about possible Chinese investment in the Hungarian railroad system.

The party was well aware of the place's history as they switched venues to another one in 2010 after similar protests.

* [The last session of the Parliament wrapped up](http://www.politics.hu/20140213/parliament-wraps-up-four-year-cycle/), the next time they'll convene will be after the elections, after cutting down the MP number by almost half to 199. The meeting hall will be refurbished accordingly in the coming month.

* [We slipped in World Press Freedom Index to 64th](http://www.politics.hu/20140213/hungary-slips-in-world-press-freedom-rankings/). In 2010, before the current government took power we were place 23rd and have been steadily dropping ever since. Papua New Guinea, Niger and Haiti are steadily ahead of us for the 3rd year now.

* The embassies are making it ridiculously hard for citizens with Hungarian resident addresses to vote abroad ([Hungarian source only](http://index.hu/belfold/2014/02/15/igy_szivatjak_azt_aki_kulfoldon_el/)). Registration forms are rejected for the tiniest of mistakes, even though the law specifically notes that minor issues should be no ground to reject the registrations if the applicant can be identified without doubt, they still do it anyways. One of the rejections was for a person with a doctorate degree: they rejected her registration because she didn't list her Dr. title in her birth name, while others were rejected for writing their names without Hungarian accents on the letters. Since those without Hungarian resident addresses tend to be ethnic Hungarian living in Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Ukraine and everyone else is thought to simply be an ex-pat, Fidesz is playing a very questionable act with this. The ethnic Hungarians barely have to do anything and can vote by mail, while the ex-pats have to travel hundreds or sometimes thousands of kms just to vote.

* [The economy grew by 2.7%, ahead of analysts expectations of 2.3.](http://www.bdlive.co.za/world/europe/2014/02/14/central-europes-economies-finish-2013-with-faster-growth)

What happened is that Canadian law enforcers took down a child pornography site and tipped off local authorities on the customers. High ranking German politician Edathy (an SPD party member) is one of the alleged customers, so when German police saw the name they informed the minister of domestic affairs (a CDU party member) about it. Now, the scandal arose because when CDU and SPD were negotiating about forming a coalition for the current government, Friedrich tipped off the SPD leadership about the investigations on Edathy, who might in turn have been warned and proceeded to destroy evidence.

* [ADAC president Meyer steps down](http://www.dw.de/embattled-adac-president-peter-meyer-resigns/a-17421735): 
ADAC, the german car drivers association, is the largest lobbying organization of Germany, perhaps even of Europe, representing 19 million members. Every year, they handed out ""Car of the year"" prizes based on votes by their members. As it turns out, those numbers had been completely faked by the organizations communications chief, leading to a return of the prizes by the car makers this week. After an initially arrogant response to the exposure, the ADAC has taken a more humble stance towards ongoing reveals, such as the use of government financed rescue helicopters operated by ADAC to travel. Meyer was reluctant to step down claiming no knowledge of the wrong-doings until finally the pressure got too big.

Hallo, ich heiße _______, und heute bin ich hier am ______, um ein Interview über Dressur zu führen.
Bitte, wie heißen Sie?
Und ist das Ihr Pferd? Was ist sein Name?
Er ist sehr schön. Er ist ein Dressurpferd, ja? Ist Dressur denn ihr Lieblingssport?
Ist er ein deutsches Warmblut?
Warum Niederländisch?
Wie oft in der Woche reiten sie?
Ich merke, mit ihren Ritt für heute fertig sind. Was streben Sie an?
Und was sind Ihre Pläne für das kommende Jahr?
Wirklich? Haben sie zuvor Intermediaire geritten?
Das ist gut für den ersten Versuch! Es ist nicht so ganz einfach! Was sagen Sie zu den Menschen, die denken Dressur ist einfach?
Ja, ich weiß, es ist sehr schwierig. Aber es lohnt sich. Und so warum reiten Sie Dressur? Warum lohnt es sich für Sie?
Was ist ihrer Meinung nach, der Zweck von Dressur?
Ist Deutschland der besten Ort, um für Dressur zu trainieren?
Sind sie mit einem der „Meister“ geritten? Walter Zettl, Klaus Balkenhol, Axel Steiner?
Walter Zettle hat Mimi einmal eine Kuh genannt, weil eine Schecke und faul ist!
Wie hat Deutsch zu sprechen ihnen beim Reiten geholfen?
Und würden sie in Deutschland trainieren, wenn sie könnten?
Eines Tages möchte ich vielleicht dorthin reisen. Und Sylvano möchte die Niederlande besuchen, ja?

There are two points to be made about this Danish ban:

1. If animal rights are the reason for the ban, those animal rights should be applied uniformly to all cultures which have traditional practices which violate the Danish idea of animal rights.

2. If protection of traditional lifestyles is the reason the Faroese and Greenlanders are allowed to continue their hunts, Jews and Muslims should be allowed to continue their slaughtering methods for the same reason.

The Danish ban is applied selectively, making it discriminatory. 

There is an argument (made by /u/Ioun in another comment) that the difference is that the Greenlanders and Faroese were already living there before Denmark became sovereign, grandfathering in their rights, while Jews and Muslims immigrated there knowing that Danes had different sensibilities.

Hallo! Wie geht’s?  Das ist mein deutscher Blog. Ich habe zwei Jahre lang ab und zu Deutsch gelernt, und jetzt finde ich, dass ich genug Übung habe, um einen Blog zu schreiben. Im Voraus möchte ich mich für meine vielen Fehler entschuldigen. Wie mache ich mich bis jetzt?  Gut?  Schlecht?  Weiter geht’s! 
Seit 2012 habe ich die Website „Duolingo“ um zu lesen, zu übersetzen, und Wörter, Sätze, und Ausdrücke zu schreiben, genutzt.  Vor kurzem habe ich **den deutschen Baum** (I don't understand this, I think ""Deutschkurs"" instead of ""den deutschen Baum"" would be better) auf Duolingo fertiggestellt. Obwohl ich mit „Rosetta Stone“ begonnen hatte zu lernen,  habe Duolingo ich nützlicher gefunden, besonders im Bezug auf das Lernen von Adverbien, abstrakte Objekte, und den schwierige Präpositionen.
**Rosetta Stone Bilder verwendet, was gut für Dinge ist.  Es kam eine Zeit, dass ich würde Inhalt brauchen.** (Again, I don't understand what you mean, sorry.)
Scheiße ist das schwer!  Stimmt doch, oder?  Lesen und Verstehen ist einfach. Ich kann beides mit Leichtigkeit machen. Viele deutsche Wörter sind ähnlich den Englischen.  **Manche Wörter werden kleinere Wörter zusammengesetzt.**(Again, I don't understand this)  Ich habe Probleme beim Schreiben.  Ich kann gut buchstabieren, und ich kann schreiben was ich höre.  Meine eigene Gedanken entwickeln und sie vermitteln? Das ist schwer.
Vielleicht sollte leichtere Sätze üben?  Ich muss integriert sein, von Deutschen umgeben sein.  Irgendwann ich will nach Deutschland oder in die Schweiz Schweiz reisen.  Diese Länder sind schön und interessieren mich sehr. Ich würde es lieben, in das Ausland zu reisen. Das einzige Land in dem ich tatsächlich gewesen bin, ist Kanada.  Und dort, sprechen sie Englisch oder Französisch. Meine Muttersprache ist Englisch, was ich daher fließend spreche, im Gegensatz zu Französisch was ich kaum kann.
Ich weiß nicht, ob ich für eine Reise nach Europa bereit bin. Ich würde es gern sein. Vielleicht bin ich es ja? Trotzdem, eine Reise muss warten. Ich habe keinen Zeit.In einem Jahr oder zwei, wer weiß das schon?

Mein Kopf tut weh. Meine Grammatik ist schlecht. Mein Wortschatz ist klein.  Ich muss üben, wieder und wieder. Oder, vielleicht könnte ich dies noch mehr zu tun.  Nächstes Mal werde ich mehr zu sagen haben.  Hoffentlich.  Ich werde immer besser. Vor zwei Wochen, hätte ich dies wahrscheinlich nicht schreiben können.  **So gibt es, dass.** (Sorry)

Hat es Spaß gemacht das zu lesen?  Nochmals, es tut mir leid für meine schlechte „Grammatik.“  Ob auch Sie Deutsch sprechen und mir helfen könnten?  Danke im Voraus!

Even if it makes it to the parliament, the opposition stated that will reject this law proposal. If it comes to that, it's possible that the President will invoke executive orders and bypass the Parliament all together [[CM]](http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/02/13/cabinet-approves-privatisation-bill-amid-protests/)

* Semi-State Power company went on a strike on Friday, to protest privatisation plans which they consider poorly put together and that it punishes the wrong people (that the fault in fact lies with the administration, not the workers). With the power plants operating with minimum staff, rolling blackouts ensued, lasting an hour.

true,PM_ME_YOUR_VAGINA,null,null,"Auf dem Blog mimikama.at wurde ein Artikel geposted, der WhatsApp als Wanze darstellt, die vertrauliche Informationen “klaut” und die totale Kontrolle ueber ein Handy hat. Dass WhatsApp nicht gerade die sicherste Messaging-App ist sollte jedem bekannt sein. Das will ich auch gar nicht dementieren. Eher die Anspielung, dass die App totale Kontrolle auf das Handy hat und viel zu viele Berechtigungen hat.


Ich selber bin Entwickler fuer Android- und iPhone-Apps sowie fuer Webapplikationen im Backend-Bereich, wobei hier nur das Anwendungsgebiet Android von Relevanz ist. Ich selber, habe eine App entwickelt, die ledeglich News anzeigt und diese auch cached und nur fuer diese “simple” Anwendung brauche ich bereits 4 Berechtigungen. Nun aber um auf WhatsApp zurueckzukommen folgendes.


Hier die List der “WhatsApp”-Benachrichtigungen kopiert von mimikama.at und anbei beschreibe ich, warum diese Berechtigung notwendig ist.


Ihre Konten  
Konten auf dem Gerät suchen  
Konten auf dem Gerät verwenden  
Konten hinzufügen oder entfernen  
Konten erstellen und Passwörter festlegen  


Grund: Wenn Sie mit dem Android-Phone in die Einstellungen gehen, sehen Sie dort Ihre Konten (z.B. Facebook, Google, Shazam etc.) – Damit eine App das tun kann, braucht sie den Account Manager. Zum Beispiel um den zu checken ob ein WhatsApp-Account besteht ist die Funktion “getAccountsByType” notwendig, die die Berechtigung “GET_ACCOUNTS” benoetigt. Um ein Konto hinzuzufuegen braucht die App die Berechtigung “MANAGE_ACCOUNTS”, also Kontenverwalten. Das gleiche gilt auch fuer Kontos hinzuzufuegen und zu loeschen.


Gibt es denn da ein Risiko? Nein, im Grunde genommen nicht. Will eine App also beispielsweise ihren Google-Account abfragen, dann brauchen Sie eine explizite Berechtigung da dann auth token benutzt werden muessen um Zugriffe zu gewaehrleisten. Wie man jetzt gut sehen kann, ist die Liste bereits um 5 Berechtigungen geschrumpft.


Google-Servicekonfiguration lesen  
Standort  
Ungefährer Standort (netzwerkbasiert)  
Genauer Standort (GPS- und netzwerkbasiert)  


Grund: Mit der Google-Servicekonfiguration werden die neuen Google Play Services benutzbar gemacht, also: Google Maps, Google Play In-App Billing, Google+, Google Wallet, Google Cloud, Google Analytics, Google Cloud Messaging, Google Mobile Ads. Google selbst sagt, dass fuer die Android API diese Berechtigungbenoetigt wird. Der ungefaehre und genaue Standort KANN genutzt werden, ist aber nicht notwendig. Hier nochmal zum Nachlesen.


Ich denke, kann aber nicht mit hundert prozentiger Sicherheit sagen, dass es sich hierbei darum handelt, anderen Usern seinen Standort mitzuteilen.


Ihre Nachrichten  
SMS empfangen SMS senden  
Telefonanrufe  


Grund: Erinnert ihr euch daran, dass ihr WhatsApp das erste Mal installiert habt? Was musstet ihr machen? Genau, eure Handynr. angeben, damit WhatsApp entweder eine SMS senden oder einen Telefonanruf taetigen kann um euer Konto zu bestaetigen. Das geht sogar meistens automatisiert, ohne, dass Ihr den Bestaetigungscode manuell eingeben muesst. Und wie? Genau, indem es auf die SMS zugreift.


Netzkommunikation  
Daten aus dem Internet abrufen  
Zugriff auf alle Netzwerke  
Netzwerkverbindungen abrufen  
WLAN-Verbindungen abrufen  
WLAN-Verbindungen herstellen und trennen  


Grund: Ich denke nicht, dass ich hierzu etwas naeher erlaeutern kann. Das WhatsApp Internetzugriff braucht ist klar, dass es checken muss ob eine Internetverbindung vorliegt ebenfalls (immerhin startet die App ja nicht, wenn keine Internetverbindung vorliegt). Fuer die WLAN-Berechtigungen hier eine offizielle Antwort vom Support


&gt;We stated in the new update for the permission of configuring Wi-Fi as we added a new feature if a user connects to a unstable Wi-Fi connection, WhatsApp will notify the user that in order to connect, we suggest the user to turn off Wi-Fi. WhatsApp should not be turning on your Wi-Fi connection without your permission and we do not have the ability to turn in on automatically. We also do not automatically turn off your Wi-Fi connection unless the user acknowledges the notification.


Kontaktkarten lesen – Lesen der Kontakte um zu checken, welcher dieser Kontakte auch WhatsApp besitzt  
Telefonstatus und Identität abrufen – Damit kann die IMEI und Telefonnr. abgefragt werden, also eine Berechtigung die es praktisch WhatsApp erlaubt euch im System wiederzufinden.  
Telefonnummern direkt anrufen – Wenn ihr im Chat mit einer Person seid und euch die Optionen anguckt, habt ihr folgende Moeglichkeiten: Kontakt anzeigen/Medien/Suchen/Anruf/Hintergrund/Mehr. – Praktisch gesehen also, erlaubt diese Berechtigung die Funktion einen Kontakt direkt ueber das Kontextmenu anzurufen. Beim ersten Mal werdet ihr auch gefragt ob ihr das wirklich tun wollt da Kosten anfallen koennten. Ein User auf stackoverflow.com sagte ausserdem dazu:  

&gt;Another possible reason is so they can mute audio events if you’re in the middle of a call. This is why apps like Pandora, Spotify, etc need the permission – so they can mute themselves when you get a call.


Speicher, Zugriff auf geschützten Speicher testen &amp; USB-Speicherinhalte ändern oder löschen – Simpel: Speichern von Medieninhalten und selbst Caching! braucht diese Berechtigungen. Also erlaubt es einem Programm, oder aber ladet die Daten jedes Mal neu hinunter und speichert nichts ab.


Systemeinstellungen ändern – Damit koennte gemeint sein, dass WhatsApp ja in den eigenen Einstellungen viel aendern kann. Also die LED-Farbe bei Benachrichtigungen, den Ton, die Vibrationsdauer. Das sind alles Systemeinstellungen.


Verknüpfungen installieren &amp; Verknüpfungen deinstallieren – Beim Installieren und Deinstallieren werden Verknuepfungen auf dem Home-Screen erstellt/geloescht. System-Tools gehoert uebrigens dazu, daher find ich das ziemlich unfair, wenn man das als eigenen Punkt darstellt, obwohl es nur die Oberkategorie von den Verknuepfungen ist.


Beim Start ausführen – Damit wird die App einfach nur beim Start ausgefuehrt. Das sorgt dafuer, dass ihr sofort die Nachrichten erhaltet ohne, dass Ihr die App immer zuerst starten muesst.


Informationen zu Ihren Apps – Aktive Apps abrufen – Auch hier wieder sehr unfair. Informationen zu Ihren Apps ist ein Oberbegriff, dass heisst, wenn man aktive Apps haben moechte, braucht man definitiv auch die Berechtigung Informatinen zu Ihren Apps. Das hat dabei nichts damit zu tun, dass es mehr Berechtigungen sind.

Kamera  
Bilder und Videos aufnehmen  
Mikrofon  
Audio aufnehmen  


Grund: Sollte hier, denke ich auch klar sein. Man hat die Moeglichkeiten Sprachnachrichten zu senden und direkt ein Foto aufzunehmen und es zu senden. Nichts besonders.
Ihre sozialen Informationen, Kontakte lesen &amp; Kontakte ändern – Wieder eine Oberkategorie, die als eigenstaendige Berechtigung verkauft wird. Was damit gemacht wird ist auch klar. Damit kann WhatsApp ebenfalls Kontakte hinzufuegen und veraendern.


Auswirkungen auf den Akku – Kann ich mir nur damit erklaeren, dass WhatsApp Statistiken ueber den Akkuverbrauch pflegt. Im Grunde genommen aber nutzlose und unnoetige Berechtigung fuer die Nutzung der App


Ruhezustand deaktivieren &amp; Vibrationsalarm steuern – Wird genutzt um Push-Notifications zu aktivieren.


Synchronisierungseinstellungen, Synchronisierungsstatistiken lesen, Synchronisierungseinstellungen lesen, Synchronisierung aktivieren oder deaktivieren – Wie man hier nachlesen kann, ist das Wiederherstllen eines Verlaufes nur mit Android und iPhone moeglich. Um das zu gewaehrleisten werden Synchronisationseinstellungen abgefragt. Dieses “Feature” bemerkt ihr, wenn ihr WhatsApp neu installiert. Dann checkt die App die Synchronisationseinstellungen. Je nachdem wird die Synchronisation dann aktiviert oder nicht. Anschliessend fragt die App ob ihr den Verlauf wiederherstellen wollt.


Fazit: Wie man sehen kann ist der Artikel von mimikama.at teils Kaese. Zwar stimmt es, dass die App unsicher ist, das liegt jedoch nicht an den vielen Berechtigungen, sondern eher an den schlechten Verschluesselungsalgorithmen, die eigentlich gar nicht vorhanden sind und somit Nachrichten komplett unverschluesselt uebertragen werden.",0,1392552292,null,0,false,0,cfgmzt2,t3_1y20gc,t1_cfgmzt2,t3_1y20gc,null,1432420189,10,false,de,t5_22i0,10

There is no point in choosing either the one or the other. On the contrary, trying to force a federation is likely to result in dissolution. Dissolution will reduce Europe to insignificance. It may not matter from a political point of view, but not being able to determine its own destiny, Europe will also slip into poverty.

The EU is in constant flux with a dynamic balance between federation and member states. This is a dynamic and creative process. To try to impose a static unchanging status would be counterproductive.

Military power is based on economic power. Without an economic base, military power will collapse under its own weight. By choosing neutrality, Europe can very well survive as economic power without being a military power. China's ascent is economic not military. China will not be able to challenge the US militarily for another 50 or 100 years, if ever. Europe needs to match this economic power not any military power.

Sterling is not an option according to London; the scottish pound would be OK, if there wasn't RBS with its debt overhang way above scottish GDP.

here´s a rough translation:

""The exposed sandstones on the side of the path are 225 million years old river sediments from an era called ""Zechstein"".
They are assigned to the ""Stauf"" layer, named after the castle rock of Stauf near Eisenberg in Palatinate.

They are lushly red or rust-brown colored, allmost debris-free and very fine sandstones with only a very low solidity.
In some places they are bleached or have dark spots. Black, earthy[couldn´t find a better translation for ""mulmig""] parts contain much iron and manganese.

At the time of their sedimentation, the sands consisted of rounded Quartz grains, Feldspars and up to 50% stone fragments.
The sand grains mostly are covered by a thin layer of the iron mineral Hematite, whitch causes the red color.

The amount of fine grain of these sandstones came into being afterwards by the decomposiotion of grains from Feldspar and instable stone fragments in the course of hundreds of milion years.
Fine flaky or fibrous clay minerals formed in the spandrels between the Quartz grains.

The ""adhesive"" feature of these clay  minerals is also the reason why the sandstones of Stauf layers were mined to be used as ""green sand"" for sand casting in the iron casting industry - among others at the Heidenberg and at the Kiefern-Kopf near Schwelbach.""",0,1392558308,null,0,1392565368,0,cfgnz3y,t3_1y1zct,t1_cfgnz3y,t3_1y1zct,null,1432420651,11,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,11

La Santé améliore l'état de la société, mais n'est pas indispensables. On vivrait moins vieux et moins bien sans, comme on vivrait moins bien sans films, mais ce n'est pas à stricto sensu indispensables. D'ailleurs dans beaucoup de pays du tiers monde c'est un luxe reversé aux riches.

Si il n'arrive pas à avoir du public c'est peut être qu'il n'est pas aussi intéressant que ce qu'il croit. Un patron qui invente une bricole inutile qui ne se vent pas, il fait faillite. Un artiste qui fait quelque chose dont personne ne veut cela doit être pareil, sinon on se retrouve vite avec de grands penseurs qui subventionnent ce qu'ils pensent qu'on devrait entendre et on se retrouve au mieux avec de la soupe au pire avec de la bienpensance.


Et si certains artistes pourtant bon n'arrivent pas à trouver le public qui les apprécierait, cela veut dire qu'il reste du travail à remplir dans le management et la publicité des artisles, mais comme tu le vois ce n'est pas un boulot créatif qu'on fait en dilettante par bonne volonté grâce au basic income, mais un vrai boulot dans son bureau ou il faut chercher des solutions.

ahahahha. Pour avoir eu des problèmes de dents récement et avoir rigolé idiotement devant pendant des années, croit moi, le jour ou t'as vraiment mal aux dents tu regrettera de ne pas avoir considéré ca indispensable. 

Rends moi service et n'oublie pas de te brosser les dents tous les jours parce que le jour où t'as une infection, la douleur d'une dent cassée/rage de dents tu t'en souviendra *longtemps*.

Bien sur que si. Un employé en bonne santée est un employé bien plus productif que s'il est en train de gémir sur sa jambe cassée.

&gt;  On vivrait moins vieux et moins bien sans, comme on vivrait moins bien sans films,

""Du pain et des jeux"" ca te parle ? Le film est une des distractions acceptées socialiement de nos jours. Un défouloir parmis tant d'autre actuellement utilisés pour empêcher que la population ne craque trop vite.

&gt;  D'ailleurs dans beaucoup de pays du tiers monde c'est un luxe reversé aux riches.

* Spring is already here. 

* Two weeks ago a baby elephant, first in the country, was born in ZOO Ostrava. They are still trying to convince it to ~~suck~~ suckle its mother. In the meantime it is fed by a substitute. [Online cameras](http://www.zoo-ostrava.cz/cz/sloni-denik/kamera/).

* One of the bosses of organized crime was taken into custody. [En](http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/court-bans-accused-businessman-rittig-from-leaving-czechrep/1043467). He started his career during the communist regime when he embezzled money from a supermarket. Got 9 years in prison, was freed after 4 on president Havel mass amnesty. Quickly caught the new winds, made many friends  among the top politicians and participated in bank frauds and giant contracts for the state. To avoid paying taxes he became resident of Monaco. After two days in custody he was set free. The authorities keep his passport.

* Mayor of Brno, the second largest city in the country, ordered Facebook to shut down a very popular page criticising (by using satire) corruption and incompetence among city authorities.  He claimed copyright violation by using city logo. Two other critical pages were shut down too. 

 * An aside: this mayor is a very lucky chap. Few years ago, in a dancing ball lottery, he won second prize - a luxurious tour to Egypt. The first prize  - a car - went to the boss of South-Moravia region. Out politicians are truly fortuitous people.

* Highest court (one of several we have) decided that vaccination of children is mandatory. Avoiding it will result in small fine.

* The next day after referendum in Switzerland a newspaper asked top Czech politicians whether they would like to set up similar limits in the Czech Republic. Answers of the politicians were thoroughly evasive, pointing out that the Brussels blocks any individual action. In online questionnaire under the article 88% people voted for immigration limits.

Questo esclude l'autocertificazione, giusto?

Io ho letto un paio di articoli ma non ho minimamente capito come funzionerebbe il meccanismo. Un bonifico dall'estero diventa identico ad una fattura di prestazione occasionale con ritenuta d'acconto del 20%? Quindi devo portare tutti i bonifici al CAF per la dichiarazione dei redditi, a quel punto la mia banca fara' qualcosa per decidere se e' reddito o patrimonio (cosa fanno? mi chiamano? mi controllano?) e se e' patrimonio mi ridaranno il 20% l'anno successivo?

Now, actually I agree that slicing their throats while alive and conscious is not ""humane"". But how can killing ever be humane? Killing is inherently savage and inherently painful. The captive bolt method is notorious for failing to kill the animal. It's an all-too-common occurrence that an animal wakes up after stunning. Sometimes they wake up while being skinned. Sometimes while being eviscerated. 

If you had ever seen a hog hanging from its rear legs, skin removed, struggling and screaming, you may well change your mind and consider desanguination to be a far more preferable method.

When we killed a hog or lamb for our own consumption, we either shot it through the head--which often failed until a second shot--or hung it and slit its throat. We tried guns because some people thought it was more humane, but the knife was always faster.

I would like to see what your experts say on the matter though; it's been more than a decade since I've had any involvement.

Personally, I'm a fan of nitrogen asphyxiation for slaughter. From what I've seen, it's incredibly humane.  Does require special facilities and is more expensive, though.

* So about sports first of all Greece is the birthplace of Olympics games.The biggest sport event in the world.We had Olympics happening since 776 BC.We also have stadiums that existed since 329 BC and lasted till today and you can visit them.Today the most famous sports in Greece are football and basketball.In football our national team won the Euro 2004 participated in euro 2008 and made it to the quarter finals in euro 2012.We will also participate in the upcoming world cup in Brazil.As for the clubs the two biggest clubs are Olympiakos and Panathinaikos.AEK and PAOK are also worth mentioning.Olympiakos is participating almost every year in the champions league and this year we are in the top 16.Panathinaikos also participated in the 'champions league' final in webley 1971.The derby of the eternal enemies Olympiakos and Panathinaikos is the biggest and has amazing atmospheres by the fans.Atmospheres that cannot be seen in many countries but many times we had big fights with the fans.This led to a roule that only the home team will have fans in the stadium.As for basketball the national team has won the Euro 2 times at 1987 and 2005.2nd place at euro 1989 and 3rd place at 1949 and 2009.We also have a 2nd place at the world cup of 2006 beating USA in the semi-finals.USA with the NBAers is probably the best national basketball team in the planet their last lost was by Greece in 2006.For clubs again Olympiakos Panathinaikos are the biggest and also Ares.Instead of champions league we have Euroleagues.Panathinaikos has won the euroleague at 1996, 2000, 2002, 2007, 2009, 2011.Olympiakos 1996-97, 2011-12, 2012-13 and Ares at 1993.The fans are also really passionate in basket too.

* About politics the latest years Greece is facing an economic crisis which led us to loaning money from other countries.The crisis was caused by many reasons mainly because of the corrupted political system and embezzlements of money.The people are really angry with our government and our loaners because they acted like loan sharks.Also we are very dichotomous as what the solution should be.",0,1392563850,null,0,false,0,cfgpa6e,t3_1xx9ht,t1_cfgpa6e,t1_cfgbqao,null,1432421268,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Ideally, you could consider both mortality rates and survival rates in conjunction and control for various factors, such as incidence, time of detection, etc.  Other measures, such as the average time it takes to get an appointment with a specialist, average wait times, etc., are also useful when comparing the quality of heath care systems.  The US fares better with those types of measures as well.  But I think the most important measure is how well the system identifies and treats disease and extends life.

Dall' altra parte, c'è probabilmente un motivo per cui io sono scappato e tu (e quelli che mi insultano perchè sono scappato) sei ancora in Italia. Sarà che io sono pazzo.

Senza cattiveria, e con un filo di amarezza da parte mia, ti dico: il problema è il tuo. Sei tu che ci dovrai vivere in quel paese disastrato che è diventato l' Italia. Se tu credi che i grillini siano dei benaltristi antidemocratici ti dico ok, non cerchiamo neanche di difenderli - però, cosa si fa? Si lascia tutto in mano a Renzi, a Letta, a Napolitano e a Berlusconi?

Io una risposta non ce l'ho davvero. Ma tu, che mi sembri così sicuro e convinto del fatto che i grillini siano il male, credevo che tu una risposta ce l'avessi. Perchè se non ce l'hai, non capisco proprio questa passione nel bastonare chi, per quello che vedo io, nel modo approssimativo in cui lo fa, cerca di aprire una strada alternativa nella palude che è diventata la politica italiana.

The porn filters essentially do not exist. You have to check a box when you start a new subscription. Current subscriptions with ISPs are not affected by the filters. The filters are not new, they are the same as the old opt-in filters and are managed by ISPs, not the government.

The government coerced ISPs into making the extremely insignificant change of introducing an easy opt-in-or-out in the subscription process so that computer illiterate parents could try preventing their children accessing porn. This was done bilaterally by the administration without an act of parliament.

Calling this internet censorship is ridiculous and the misinformation that has been spread on reddit (claims like ""you have to call your ISP and ask to watch porn"") is fucking absurd. People above are *actually comparing this* to 1984. are you fucking joking?

true,kmjn,GREE,Greece,"Greece: I would say generally positive. Diaspora is a Greek word, after all, and has a fairly positive meaning going back to ancient Greece, referring to Greeks who went abroad as merchants or colonists. And in general Greeks have always had a large portion of the population outside the country; in the 19th century, for example, the four big Greek cultural centers were Constantinople, Thessaloniki, Athens, and Alexandria, and only one of those (Athens) was within Greece at the time. Large Greek populations have in the past also been present in places like Trieste, Beirut, Odessa, and Vienna.

The main modern dynamic, which does lead to some tension, is that the diaspora is both larger and wealthier than the domestic population, at least if you count diaspora broadly. If you count only people who still speak Greek and have a reasonably close connection to Greece, the diaspora is smaller than the domestic population, but still wealthier.

If someone abroad of Greek descent does anything of note, it will be in the newspapers and people will be happy to point out that this was done by a Greek. Especially in this case, there is no question whether the person is a ""real Greek"": if they've done something famous, someone who is 1/8th Greek of 3rd generation and speaks no Greek is still a Greek and their achievement is a Greek one. ;-) Among less famous people, I would say people are still relatively open to ascribing ""Greekness"" if the person speaks Greek, though the connection gets weaker if they don't. If anything the opposite is a bigger sticking point: as a Greek-American myself (who speaks Greek) I find people are happy to call me Greek but really don't like it if I refer to myself as an American. To many people this comes across as ""choosing"" America over Greece, or even implying that America is better than Greece.

This comes as they were investigating why a Garda Informant had all charges dropped after being caught with millions of euros worth of drugs to sell. Garda Commissioner Callinan denies that there was any Garda surveillance, authorized or unauthorized, of GSOC. Meanwhile, Minister for Justice says there is no cause for investigation of GSOC's claims, but later redacted that statement, saying that in a 3 hour meeting with GSOC's chairmen that surveillance had never been brought up.

* A series of unprecedented storms has ripped across the country, resulting in a Red Weather Warning, leaving at its peak over 250,000 houses and businesses without power, and leading to evacuations all along the West Coast as well as infrastructure damage reaching the hundreds of millions, however Ireland has been denied access to the EU Disaster Fund. Insurance companies have also denied payout to thousands of effected people. An engineer died while repairing phone lines during the storm.

Halal requires the animal being alive before butchering. Stunning prior to slitting animal's throat is acceptable, and indeed widely practiced in many countries. For example in Malaysian or Indonesian 'halal rules' animal can be stunned with electrical, mechanical or pneumatic stunner.

You may find some muslims who for some reason oppose stunning by claiming for example that stunning kills the animal, or that the act of stunning itself causes more pain and suffering to the animal than slitting its troat and letting it bleed to death in agony. But the fact is that 'not stunned' is not a requirement for halal, and for example in Denmark and also in Finland muslims butcher stunned animals just as the local animal welfare laws require.

&gt; How does bringing their own priest help?

There's actually not a 'priest' present (and, btw, islam has no priests).

 As from the date of the passing of this Act, the Island of Rockall (of which possession was formally taken in the  name of Her Majesty on 18th September 1955 in pursuance of a Royal Warrant dated 14th September 1955 addressed to the Captain of Her Majesty's Ship Vidal) shall be incorporated into that part of the United Kingdom known as Scotland and shall form part of the District of Harris in the County of Inverness, and the law of Scotland shall apply accordingly

Is the quote, it clearly states incorporated into the part of the United Kingdom, if Scotland is not in the United Kingdom it stands to reason the act is void.

Now it obviously also states the Law of Scotland applies. Which is why I think there will be a fight over it, way too much territory to vanish to go down without argument. Especially as Scotland is already taking a huge portion of the oil and gas, and Rockall holds a lot more.

The first two generations (emigrated ~1850) were exclusively Swedish-speaking, living in a Swedish-speaking farming town in the middle of Kansas. Around the 1900s-1920s many people moved to urban areas. That generation was generally bilingual, but still strongly congregated in the Swedish community, in particular marrying only within the Swedish Lutheran Church. There was actually a big controversy in the 1920s at many Swedish Lutheran churches over whether it was acceptable to introduce English-language church services, for example. My grandmother went to [this one](http://www.trinity-chelmsford.org/history/chrono.htm), which held its first English service in 1920, over objections.

The generation born after World War II, however, tended not to learn Swedish, saw themselves as just ""Americans"", and was more likely to intermarry with other ethnic groups. So, growing up, my grandmother spoke Swedish with her older relatives, though it became increasingly disused after older relatives died, but she spoke English with younger people.

pretty much the same. turks and kurds who emigrated to germany (and to various other european countruies) are not liked in turkey. the first and second wave who went to germany were from poor rural areas of anatolia. while nobody has a problem with their poverty they were mostly ignorant, conservatist people who never left their villages even to see their city centre let alone another country before. therefore the culture shock was inevitable when they came to europe. many people in turkey still look at them with disgust when they come back to turkey for vacation for their inconsistent and downright rude behaviour: the ones with dual citizenship vote for left parties in europe but right in turkey; they show off with their money; disobey some simple laws just because they can pay the fine ""do you know the fine for this in germany? but it's nothing here!""

This law seems to cover two very different areas. 

* sites that link to pirated material.

* link aggregation sites.

In regard to link aggregation sites, I would assume Reddit will not fall foul of this? Since the amount of information reproduced from the site (the heading) would have to be considered a ""non-significant fragment"". Sites like Google News (or Digg, I had forgotten all about Digg)

I had always wondered how Google News got away with taking pictures and text from other sites without permission. 

Surely Google can just make News an opt-in service for news websites?

Also, how will this affect RSS reader sites (like Feedly)? They are serving other peoples content, with their own ads.

Like, here in Minnesota there is a subculture that is distinct from the rest of the US because of its Swedish &amp; Norwegian components. While its not a Swedish culture, it definitely is Swedish compared to the rest of America so I think thats why we think of ourselves as Swedes: because we are more ""Swedish"" than our neighbors around us; even though we are indeed less Swedish than people from Sweden.

Also, we are very proud of equality and tolerance. When word got around that Sweden was taking in Somali refugees, we were like ""okay, we need to do that too. If the Swedes are doing that means its the right thing to do."" And now we have the largest Somali community outside of Somalia, and we are proud of them. We are also very proud of our Vietnamese and Hmong communities. We are proud that our black community is doing vastly better than most black communities in the US. And, we are ashamed that our Native American communities live in such poverty :(

The first thing anyone will tell you on r/bitcoin is not to invest money that you can´t afford to lose and that´s for a reason. Second thing would be to do your research to know what you´re dealing with. That is a pretty reasonable approach and if someone sees benefit in bitcoin he or she might start using it. If not then not.

But believe me, a lot of people all over the world see benefits in bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general. Remittances might be the most obvious one. Once the infrastructure is there people working all over the world can send money home for 1% fees instead of 11% (around this is what WesterUnion etc. charge on average is of the $550 Billion dollar market - $414 Billion of which go to developing countries.)

This is going to put more money direcltly into the hands of those who most need it. This is the most obvious benefitious usecase scenario, but there are many more. 

I agree bitcoin is not in a stage where you can seriously rely on it with your fortune or even at all for most people. At the same time it´s not getting all this attention for no reason and the technological innovation behind it will proof quite disruptive in a lot of ways.

A note on Business and Protocol:

Germans never use the first name unless one is at a nearly friend-like level with the person.

&gt; Support: ""Hello, my name is John Doe, HP Business Support, how is your day today, Firstname?""

And within two sentences he is on a-sort-of personal level while as a German, one never reaches this level this quick, most times never.

When calling a German corporation, while I know most given names of my contacts, I would never dare to address them any different than Herr Mustermann or Frau Mustermann.

Despite the fact that our ancestors mostly emigrated from Scotland in the early/mid-1800s, they have a lot of pride in being half-Scottish. I'm sure my family possesses some of the ugly stereotypes that you real (in the cultural sense) Scottish people despise: they absolutely love their clan tartan; they love pointing out the things the Scottish invented -- like golf, curling, and the likes; they blame certain family characteristics on their Scottishness; and they don't really have a good idea of where all of our family came from in Scotland. 

I generally don't remind them of the fact that they're half-English, too, though. For some reason, English pride never really travelled down the line. Yes, a lot of my family's pride comes off as a little Braveheart-esque, but their pride did actually travel down their Scottish lineage. My grandfather loved his Scottish ancestry, and his fathers before him. Basically everyone from the first immigrants all the way down to the present have very Scottish names (at least to these ears -- there are a lot of Jameses, Alexanders, Donalds, Davids, Roberts, and Williams). 

I think my family, though, is pretty good about their love of Scotland. A lot of it is kind of tongue in cheek and in good fun. Like, they love making fun of how ugly their clan tartan is, despite their love for it. One of the things they blame their ""Scottishness"" on is how cheap some of them are. A lot of self-depreciating humour. 

I apologise for the wall of text. I just find it a bit disheartening when I hear Scottish people being pretty disapproving of the diaspora. I don't think Europeans, in general, understand the importance that our society places on being bi-cultural. In Europe, it's pretty much a given that your family comes from where you are -- or close to it. In nations like Canada, our society is a mosaic of different cultures/ethnicities. You're a bit bi-cultural in that you like Canadian values, but take pride in where you came from, because Canada just doesn't have the history that Europe does.

Some do, some don't. Some are sharp as a scalpel, some are an intellectual landfill. I don't dare making up random percentages, but of course things could always be better.

&gt; Do people think their leaders are corrupt?

Some do, some don't. There are people who treat their eternal non-voting like a badge of honour, or whose whole existance seems to be based on politician-bashing in the comment sections of newspaper websites. I would say it's quite easy to find people willing to rant excessively about politicians.

I don't think corruption is what the majority of people think of when they hear ""politics,"" though. Others might think differently, of course. My personal problem with German politics is rather an exaggerated culture of Grand Coalitions and almost consociationalism-style compromise . I don't want Germany to resemble the US, but a bit more political contrast would be nice. But I digress.

There is a general, vague, not-at-all-reliable-with-respect-to-specific-measures consensus that it is a necessity to protect the evironment.

No, I just explained how disliking the religion is necessarily a generalisation; it is so because the religion doesn't exist as a unique set of traits, but as many different sets of traits in many different human beings. As such, it's impossible to judge a religion as a set of traits without generalising.

&gt; If it's inherent in a religion, and literally written in the book, then I do not see why it is wrong to dislike it.

&gt; There are no interpretations of Islam that do not follow their book. Those many ""muslims"" who do not abide by it are being good people but not acting in respect of their religion.

This is false. Not only for Islam: just like Christians can be Christians without accepting many things written in their book as truth, or even acceptable morality guidelines (in the New testament it's made explicit that everything taught by the Old Testament keeps being valid, but you won't find many believers wanting to apply those teachings to today's society). It's just the reality of religions: it's a guise that people wear over their own personal principles, which depend on their society, their uprising and their life experience, disregarding the parts that are contradictory with them. All interpretations of Islam (that I know of) follow their book, just like all interpretations of Christianity (that I know of) follow the Bible, it's just that different people interpret the same letters in different ways, and choose to disregard different parts of their books.

In the end, the only requirement to be part of a religion is to genuinely believe that you form part of that religion, because if it was necessary to interpret those books in the exact same way that the people who wrote them did, then we can safely say that none of today's major religions have even a single follower.",1,1392591913,null,0,false,0,cfh0be0,t3_1y1noe,t1_cfh0be0,t1_cfgzhvo,null,1432426602,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Viele Betroffene quälen sich jahrzehntelang, gerade weil das Thema vielleicht das letzte große Tabu in unserer Gesellschaft ist, ohne dass es zu Übergriffen kommt.

Genau die Pflichtlektüre, die du gepostet hast, spielt ja darauf an, dass den Betroffenen in unserer Gesellschaft weitestgehend blankes Unverständnis für ihre Situation entgegenschlägt und ich persönlich finde es daher sehr positiv, dass es daher mittlerweile für fast alles Ansprechsstellen gibt, an die man sich in seiner Not wenden kann.

Ein schöner Post, den ich die Tage hier auf Reddit gelesen habe ging in diese Richtung: Wir akzeptieren jede körperliche Beschwerde als Krankheit, aber Probleme mit unserem komplexesten Organ werden ignoriert, abgetan und belächelt.

That's correct. I support LGBT rights, but I don't want to tell other nations what to do, especially if I'm not of their race. I'm not going to go travel to Saudi Arabia, protest for them (for their rights), then get arrested. That's idiotic and I have no rights for doing that.

And that's interventions worked out so well, didn't they? If a huge majority backs the government, then we have no reason to try and force a change. These interventions were backed by the majority of the people (and they still didn't work out well), so that's a complete different story to Russia's anti-gay discrimination.

Well, from reading the title, (I can't read the article, not in my language book), I got the hint that she traveled to Russia just to protest.

You can see 4 levels:

* Lowest:  Basque territories. This can be explained by fiscal privileges(foral fiscal system),  a controled real state sector, and higher qualified specializations. 
* Remainder North and the Capital: includes some regions that aren't doing very well but they have aged populations and high emigration rates: Galicia, Asturies, most of Castilla - León,  Huesca and Teruel in Aragon.

the 18th/19th century emigration was unique for variety of reasons, and their increased activity was as exceptional as was their aim. to keep alive the non-existing country and bring it back to life fully when opportunity presents itself. you can't really measure them and their importance by the same methods you'd use for today diaspora. and I've never met a Pole who thought of them as diaspora in today's meaning of the word. those were the people who'd have been in the center of events, hadn't it been dangerous for them. the political refugees forced to emigrate for their deeds and/or the ones who chose the life in exile to be able to actually do something. the [Hotel Lambert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B4tel_Lambert#The_political_salon) comes to mind. [and to some extend the government in exile during and after WWII.]

Kościuszko and Puławski aren't seen as emigrants here, and for sure they're not considered something that *America gave to us*... it's totally the other way around. and a source of pride at that.

besides, we're not talking about the 18th century heroes here. just regular present-day people and the American Polonia are mostly the ones considered so out of touch they look like Poland 20 years ago. in their political views, in showing their *polishness*, musical taste judging by visting Polish artists, and the belief how poland looks today...  
not to offend anyone but en masse the American Polonia is perceived by *Polish Poles* as they themselves are by Americans. one huge stereotype. not favorable in the least.  
and, what's important, when talking about the American Polonia we generally have in mind at least the second generation Americans, more often the third or more. and majority don't really bother to visit to see how's Poland today. that's why they're mostly out of touch. for comparison the Poles in UK are either the first generation from the last decade or the second/third from after the WWII but they tend to be more in touch and more willing to visit, i.e. there's no Atlantic in the way.

personally, I think that people who left the country for good and have been abroad for five years and longer, and have no intention to go back, shouldn't have the right to vote in Polish elections.

The indifference is manifested by a complete lack of understanding that maybe, just maybe, Danes abroad don't keep up with every little bit of boring Danish news that's going on in Denmark. They frequently have to be reminded of this fact, as otherwise they will continue to try to make jokes that aren't funny, and statements that only make sense to other Danish people.

The outright hatred is probably mostly political. There's a general view that people shouldn't leave Danish society, because it helped them grow up, and supported them and all that (even if they didn't grow up there) and that if they leave, they can go to hell and die and should lose their citizenship (or shouldn't have gotten it in the first place).

On the other hand, there's a lot of encouragement from the scientific community that we have to go abroad to work, so there's usually a lot of understanding and encouragement from that side of things. However, they expect you back, probably due to the aforementioned political pressure.
