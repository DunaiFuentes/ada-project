- numbers to ten, up to twenty if you feel ambitious. Now you can order simple things easily, e.g. ""Zwei Bier, bitte!""

Brötchen is little buns, usually eaten for breakfast -- you can save lots of money on breakfast if you just get some cheese, Nutella, meat, etc from the store and buy fresh buns each morning. You say it something like 'broatchyen'. The word has sounds not used in English, but point and you should be understood.

- bitte can mean a lot of things. It means please, but it also means you're welcome/my pleasure, so you can expect to hear it if you tell someone 'danke'. If you walk in to a small shop or approach a counter, someone might greet you with ""bitte"" or ""bitte schön"": they mean ""hi, how can I help you?"" Say bitte like the English word 'bitter', except stop and swallow the R.

However- Germany seem to have a political deadlock - everyone just randomly are against it, so no solutions can be found. 

Finland are storing their too for hundred of thousands of years. Not like we do, but a Finnish solution. I think that Germany can get that too - but the politics is somehow paralyzing the science.

Bien sûr que non, comme je l'ai dit, cette généalogie n'a aucune valeur littérale.

&gt; Dommage qu'ils soient anonymes pour 3 d'entre eux sur 4 alors. À moins que ? L'Église a peut être prétendu par le passé que les évangiles sont nommés d'après leurs auteurs, mais il me semble qu'aujourd'hui elle ne le fait plus ?

Un peu de précisions : Jean l'évangéliste est bien Jean l'apôtre, certitude historique. Jean l'auteur de l'Apocalypse est probablement le même, pas de certitude historique.

L'évangile selon saint Luc et les Actes des Apôtres ont été écrits de façon certaine par la même personne, que l'on nomme traditionnellement Luc, sans le relier à l'un des personnages contemporains connus. La personnalité de l'auteur transparaît clairement à travers le texte, cependant, comme celle d'un païen (non-juif) converti, originaire d'Antioche (toujours d'après ses propres textes).

Saint Marc, nommé également Jean, est mentionné dans les Actes, c'était un disciple de Pierre qui est assez bien identifié et on est à peu près certain qu'il est l'auteur principal de l'évangile éponyme.

Enfin, l'évangile selon saint Matthieu n'est probablement pas majoritairement de Matthieu l'Apôtre, mais il a peut-être été rédigé par un ou plusieurs de ses disciples. En tous cas, le rédacteur a clairement le même profil que Matthieu l'Apôtre : c'est un juif orthodoxe, probablement un lévite, connaisseur de la numérologie hébraïque et de la liturgie du Temple.

Morale de l'histoire : on connaît très bien l'origine historique des évangiles, même si les identités des auteurs ne sont pas forcément claires.

&gt; On est d'accord pour dire qu'elle s'est bien plantée dans le passé ? 

Obvious troll, je passe. Si tu veux un débat constructif, évite ce genre de chose.

&gt; Du coup on est en droit de se demander s'ils ont assisté à la moindre des chose décrites dans les évangiles.

Il y a un gros pas entre ""oui, les éléments relatés dans les évangiles sont majoritairement des témoignages de seconde main"" (excepté pour Jean comme je l'ai expliqué), ce qui est évident et ne pose de problème ni à moi ni à l’Église, et ""bon ben du coup ça n'a aucune valeur"". Marie a vécu plusieurs années parmi les Apôtres après la mort de Jésus, elle a clairement eu des contacts avec ""Luc"", elle a pu lui relater l'histoire de l'Incarnation (Annonciation, Visitation, Nativité, enfance de Jésus) qui constitue le début de l’Évangile de Luc. Ce n'est pas comme si on avait attendu des dizaines de générations pour fixer une tradition orale : là c'est du témoignage de seconde main, max. Sauf la généalogie.

&gt;The effect of Survation’s weighting, predictably, has been to increase the estimated No lead considerably. Before the data were weighted at all (including to make sure that the sample matches the demographic profile of Scotland), the Yes tally stood as high as 43% (after the Don’t Knows are excluded).  The weighting has knocked as much as five points off that figure. It looks highly likely that if Survation had followed the same practice as most other pollsters, the reported Yes vote in this poll would have been over 40%  – just as it was in last weekend’s ICM poll and is in this weekend’s TNS BMRB poll.

That's a little confused. The EU doesn't have any foreign policy except what's agreed by the member states, on an intergovernmental basis.

true,TheClawyer,null,null,"Sorry for the delay in responding here. I agree with the commenters (including yourself) who have said one doesn't need to believe in any kind of religious or spiritual power to appreciate La Comedia or any of Dante's writings, however my own religious views certainly did influence my initial and ongoing interpretation of his work. 
I read it in college and it blew my mind how comprehensively it covered the politics of his time, sweeping theological ideas, Greek and Roman philosophy, and certain aspects in the history of Italy and Europe. In that first reading it affected me most significantly because of how amazingly intricate it was and how it seemed to me, even though I knew how much nuance I missed, that many people read it very superficially. That was reinforced when I took a course later in college by a professor who I feel did a fantastic job walking us through Inferno and Purgatorio (sadly not enough time in the semester for Paradiso) using a less 'orthodox' reading of the work. This professor saw Dante as more following the teachings of Aristotle and other Greek and Arabic thinkers more so than Catholic theology. The professor had a very thorough grasp on the Bible, all the Greek works Dante references, etc. so it made the reading a lot of fun and very interesting.
The second time I read all of La Comedia I went through much more slowly to try and pick up on some of the things I missed when I read it the first time.
I wrote my Honors thesis on Dante, focusing on his ideas of the proper relation between the Church and Empire of his day.
The third (and current time) I am reading it in Italian. My Italian is still limited but this is a fun and worthwhile exercise for me.
I went to Florence a few years ago and spent the summer studying the language and Dante in general, visiting places he references in Florence, taking way too many pictures of his statue and empty tomb in Santa Croce, and then going to visit his burial site in Ravenna.
So to sum it up, because this is probably way more choppy and roundabout of an answer than you wanted, through my readings of Dante I have learned a lot not only about theology and Christian thought from that time period, but also so much more history, philosophy, politics, etc. It's introduced me to other monumental works like the Aeneid and Ovid's Metamorphosis, and it compelled me to travel to Firenze and Ravenna to learn more. I guess I got a little obsessed. I even have a small Dante bust on my desk.

However, my main Dante cred comes from having read the Dan Brown book. ",0,1391734307,null,0,false,0,cf8zqme,t3_1x4dnb,t1_cf8zqme,t1_cf8gj6x,null,1435502867,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

Whoa whoa whoa. Do you even remember what the Rumsfeld quote is? It's [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Europe_(politics\)):

&gt; Rumsfeld: Now, we rarely find unanimity in the world. I was ambassador to NATO, and I -- when we would go in and make a proposal, there wouldn't be unanimity. There wouldn't even be understanding. And we'd have to be persuasive. We'd have to show reasons. We'd have to -- have to give rationales. We'd have to show facts. And, by golly, I found that Europe on any major issue is given -- if there's leadership and if you're right, and if your facts are persuasive, Europe responds. And they always have.

&gt; Now, you're thinking of Europe as Germany and France. I don't. I think that's old Europe. If you look at the entire NATO Europe today, the center of gravity is shifting to the east. And there are a lot of new members. And if you just take the list of all the members of NATO and all of those who have been invited in recently -- what is it? Twenty-six, something like that? -- you're right. Germany has been a problem, and France has been a problem.

&gt; Q: But opinion polls --

&gt; Rumsfeld: But -- just a minute. Just a minute. But you look at vast numbers of other countries in Europe. They're not with France and Germany on this, they're with the United States.

Rumsfeld was merely saying that Europe is something more than France and Germany. Thinking ""France and Germany"" as a synonym for ""Europe"" is the old way of thinking about Europe. The ""new Europe"" is one that has many different actors and the power of Germany and France has been diluted. His point was that you couldn't paint the diplomatic conflict as ""US against Europe"" because most of the countries in Europe were on board with the US: it was the big countries like France and Germany that were not. Or at least, that's what he's claiming, which is what is important in the context of his quote.

Now, I don't really agree because France and Germany still hold a controlling share of the influence, but it's certainly much less Franco-German-centric than it was in the ECSC.

&gt; Nations/people don't like to to used and that is what the US does on a daily bases now.

&gt;If all politicians truly are tyranical and self interested (which personally I find hard to believe) then they wouldn't be interested in things so trivial as money.

Money is critical to politics. On the extreme side of things, in the US congressmen spend about 75% of their time begging for money in various ways (fundraisers, calling lobbyists, meeting with them, listening to their opinions, accepting their suggestions for legislation, etc). I know the EU countries all have campaign finance spending laws, and I don't know too much about the political system in, say, Germany or the UK. However, I do know that in Canada (where campaign financing is heavily regulated) fundraising still plays a huge role and there are tons of ways to circumvent the laws and ""give"" more generously to the right politician.

All of which is simply to say that:

a) money is central to politics everywhere

b) those who give money regularly will always have more access to the ears of politicians.

&gt;But I think to argue that right up the highest levels of power are being dictated by some random Ukrainian politicians and oligarchs is just not likely.

The thing is, what are those ""highest"" levels of power? Oligarchs don't need to reverse any policy decision, just slow down its implementation. With the EU being a bureaucratic mess that it is, they don't need to get all the way to the top to accomplish this.

And something that I like to point out .. a stat that I found interesting when I first read it: The Jewish population of Germany was 500000 people out of 65 million Germans.  That is less than 1% of the population.

That means there must have been many Germans who just didn't have a lot of contact with the Jewish population, right?

I just think that the west tells so many tales of the tragedies that we get the impression that every German saw Jews disappearing left right and center .. and did nothing.  But it really wasn't as obvious as that.  And concentration camps were thought of as being more like prisons.   That's how they were shown.

There was blatant racism, sure.  But if we go back to the 1930s you could find a lot of racists in the world.

So yes .. people could have done something.  But everything happened so fast .. and then the war was on.  And suddenly bombs are falling and they are supposed to be aware of why and how Jews are disappearing?  Some yes.  But I can really imagine that not everyone knew what was happening to this small group of Germans .. or were even interested.  And what should you do?  Complain?  Organize a coup, Mr Shoemaker?

How interested are you in what is happening to Indians?  Or how much am I going out of my way to stop any of the atrocities that are happening in the world right now?  Don't bother me with that!  I gotta feed my kids!

.. y'know?

So I don't know if I agree with the idea that all Germans were responsible for what happened.  Some .. yes.

Chiefly because empathy with the party that was wronged should evoke some sense of justice and accommodating remorse. At times, all that people can muster are actions related to empathy (voting for reparations, learning about it, giving to charity, etc.). That's not ideal and should not even be a resting point, but it's a good start. When it's been a very long time, it shouldn't stop people from emphasizing with people who were wronged. They just need to cultivate the belief that empathizing with really old atrocities is good for promoting togetherness. 

Also, modern day versions of those things for most Americans are the Asian internment camps of WWII in the US, civil rights clashes of the 50 and 60s where racial minorities and women were abused and killed nearly every day just because they were protesting for equal rights, wars we killed half a generation of people for that were unwinnable and made up to sell arms, and even the civil rights cases now concerning sexual orientation.

Bon, donc Dieu est bien intervenu dans le processus. Que ce soit hors du temps, de façon éternelle, de façon ponctuelle, il y a d'après la croyance catholique, plus que les processus naturels connus en jeu pour arriver de la première cellule au premier humain.

&gt; Bien sûr que non, comme je l'ai dit, cette généalogie n'a aucune valeur littérale.

Du coup, Adam, il se situe où ? Si on donne à l'église une machine à voyager dans le temps, elle saurait trouver Adam ? 

&gt; &gt; On est d'accord pour dire qu'elle s'est bien plantée dans le passé ?

&gt; Obvious troll, je passe. Si tu veux un débat constructif, évite ce genre de chose.

On n'est donc pas d'accord ? Je n'ai jamais rencontré de catholique qui prétende l'église infaillible. Et c'est un peu le coeur de la discussion: tu dis qu'il faut faire confiance à l'église pour avoir fait un tri correct entre l'erroné et l'absolument correct, ça me semble raisonnable du coup de regarder si l'église a été fiable quand elle recherchait des vérités vérifiables.

Donc désolé, je sais que ça fait râler les catholiques, mais je vais reparler de Galilée. L'Église aime bien rappeler que cette affaire n'était pas une guerre contre la science, mais un manque de tact de la part de Galilée et querelle politique entre deux personnes. Le problème c'est qu'une de ces deux personnes était pape, et que l'église a prouvé qu'elle pouvait être entraînée dans une querelle. À l'issue de cette affaire, les plus hautes instances de l'église disent, dans un document signé de plusieurs cardinaux, formés en tribunal religieux et sous l'autorité directe du Saint Siège que ""La proposition selon laquelle le soleil est le centre du monde et ne bouge pas et absurde et philosophiquement et formellement hérétique, car elle est expressément contraire aux Écritures. La proposition que la Terre ne soit ni le centre du monde ni immobile, mais qu'elle se déplace, de plus avec un mouvement diurne, est également absurde et philosophiquement faux et au moins faux d'un points de vue de la foi.""

Je peux te retrouver les documents explicitant la discussion qui a précédée et qui montre qu'ils ont décidé d'interpréter littéralement le passage de Josué parlant d'un arrêt miraculeux du soleil. Il y est dit explicitement que l'interprétation correcte de ce passage est l'interprétation littérale et que ne pas l'accepter c'est refuser la doctrine de l'église.

&gt; Il y a un gros pas entre ""oui, les éléments relatés dans les évangiles sont majoritairement des témoignages de seconde main"" (excepté pour Jean comme je l'ai expliqué), ce qui est évident et ne pose de problème ni à moi ni à l’Église, et ""bon ben du coup ça n'a aucune valeur""

Il n'y a pas un gros pas, il y a une ou deux petites étapes. Laisse moi les expliciter:
1. Les éléments relatés dans les évangiles sont majoritairement des témoignages de seconde main
2. Certains de ces éléments sont faux (la généalogie de Jésus, le massacre des Innocents)
3. Certains de ces éléments sont invérifiables

On est donc en droit d'avoir des doutes sur chaque élément non vérifié. La doctrine catholique est de dire qu'on peut se passer de ces vérifications, car l'église guidée par le Saint Esprit est capable de déterminer la vérité. Sauf qu'elle s'est régulièrement plantée dans l'histoire avec des interprétations littérales de choses fausses.

&gt; Marie a vécu plusieurs années parmi les Apôtres après la mort de Jésus, elle a clairement eu des contacts avec ""Luc"", elle a pu lui relater l'histoire de l'Incarnation

C'est tout à fait possible, et ça renforcerait le récit que l'auteur indique que ses infos proviennent de Marie directement, ce qui n'a rien d'une évidence. Du coup, tous les événements entourant la naissance de Jésus n'auraient plus quatre mais un seul témoin. Et on peut supposer que tous les événements concernant Joseph, Zacharie et les rois mages passent par le seul témoignage de Marie et deviennent donc au minimum des témoignages de troisième main. 

Donc, sur la naissance, on a un seul témoin mais quand même des versions différentes en fonction des évangiles, ça montre que les gens qui retranscrivaient avaient soit très peu de rigueur, soit se situaient en fait plus loin des témoignages de première main que tu ne le dis. Dans les deux cas, ça impose d'avoir beaucoup de méfiance envers ces sources pour la suite.

&gt; Ce n'est pas comme si on avait attendu des dizaines de générations pour fixer une tradition orale

Les historiens les plus optimistes parlent de 30 ans après la mort de Jésus pour le plus vieux des évangiles. C'est un peu comme si on commençait tout juste à fixer les mémoires de la guerre du Vietnam. L'Église explique comment ce délai ?

Absolutely. I agree. Though I wouldn't even say ""feeling sorry"" really cuts it.

I think what separates what I meant from the notion of original sin and actually being responsible for doing something is that, in my notion, it's a choice you're taking upon yourself to *feel* responsible. You're accepting the sin basically. It would be mandatory within the mantle of being an American (which is the choice to be or not). And the institution is constant, as long as that endures, its actions shouldn't just wash away.

Having said that, don't know if I really consider blood on our hands through inaction as a thing *here*. Look at it this way - if we go toe to toe with Russia, and Gazprom starts messing around with the gas supplies to Eastern Europe, I can pretty much guarantee you that more people will die than have died in the Ukraine. And those people will be EU citizens, and the Ukrainians aren't. We don't owe them just because they'd like to get into the EU - we owe our own people.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"Sure. The EU (as a bloc) isn't intervening, which is what the US thinks it *should* be doing, that's all. 

Intervention - active, and immediate - does tend to be the US reflex when their interests are concerned, and is always justifiable under those circumstances. Note that I'm not saying it's the US reflex under *all* circumstances, because it isn't. Another US poster brought up the point that the US intervention in Libya and Mali wasn't US-driven, but French-led, and to some extent the same with Syria. That's part of my point - those countries are not US interests, but traditionally French ones, and the somewhat over-extended US had no interest in intervention, while the French did.

Ukraine, however, seems to be a US interest. The only obvious explanation for that is that it is a Russian satellite state. The US didn't care about Mali or Libya, nor much about Syria, but Ukraine starts wobbling and suddenly the US is terrifically interested, and hacked off that the EU won't join in. But people don't seem to join those dots the same way I do.

Is there another explanation why this Russian client state is of more interest to the US than Mali, Libya or Syria? I'm open to suggestions as to what US interests are involved here *other* than weakening Russia.

If you attend a German uni as an exchange student through an American university (usually limited to a one year stay), you avoid the problems of having Abitur equivalency (since uni makes up for it) and will be allowed to study without having the required German skills.

Political reality is accepting that there is and there will be demand for ivory, just in the same way there is demand for gold or any other luxury. You can't change that, people still wear fur coats. Regulating its trade is, in my opinion, a much wiser decision than leaving it in hands of well-financed poachers, hoping that somehow people will stop finding ivory valuable and/or pretty just because ""poor elephants"".

Solution? Have countries invest on developing cheap vat-grown ivory. There would still be a (illegal) market for REAL ivory, but the prices would drop till it's no longer that profitable.

The Camino Francés (yellow trail) is probably your best shot. It's the most walked by far, and also has the most albergues built up along it, which typically charge around 15 euros a night, sometimes less. That makes it easy and cheap to travel.

I purchased a small guide with maps of the trail beforehand. It was extremely helpful because it included where the albergues where on the trail, and how many beds each of the albergues had. 

For example, if you arrived to an albergue at 4pm, only having walked 15km. If you wanted to bang out an extra 10km before the end of the day, it was great to look at the map and see that there wasn't another albergue for another 15km.

Invece che tenermi con se mi ha sbattuto a casa dei suoi genitori, con appunto i miei nonni e gli zii.

true,mizhoda,BOSN,Bosnia and Herzegovina,"The protests started in Tuzla on thursday. Main reason is that privatization of factories was corrupted. Workers of  ""Dita“, ""Konjuh“, ""Resod guming“, ""Polihem“ i ""Poliolchem“ have really bad working conditions and some of them did not receive paycheck for 14 months. Another reason is general dissatisfaction with local governments that were really corrupt over years, people have just now started to wake up. On Thursday 27 people were arrested including the young leader Aldin Širanović. Everyone has been released. On friday around 4-5k people were in Tuzla and protests spread to Sarajevo, Bihać, Zenica, Kakanj and Mostar. None of these town had more than few hundred people on streets but it is expected for that number to rise today. My major concerns are that there are a lot of young hooligans that are on streets aside workers and I personally think their main goal is just to destroy. That may not necessarily be a bad thing if the politicians get a little scared. Another thing is that these protests have occured only in cities with predominantly Bosniak people, there hasn't been protests in towns where Croats and Serbs are majority, even though the situation is the same in those cities when it comes to corruption and these protests are solely against local governments, there is no nationality or anything else. At least for now.
Edit: I should mention that protests are not peaceful, yesterday in Tuzla there were 102 policeman in Tuzla hospital, but I think that number is exaggerated. One policeman is in critical situation, but he is getting better. There were dozen injured people, mainly in Tuzla. The local government building in Tuzla is completely ruined by rocks and the politicians run away. In other towns protesters were throwing eggs and occasionally rocks at the government buildings.

Have a look at the map. Finland, Estland and Latvia already have direct borders. Lithuania and Poland too, if you count Kaliningrad. Belorussia is, at least geostrategically, a Russian satellite. Then comes the Ukraine, then the Black Sea, then Turkey.

I don't think that's an option. It's EU accession or Russian satellite. If there was a third option, we wouldn't have this situation in the first place.

&gt;

&gt;The **Lombards** or **Langobards** ([Latin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language): Langobardī, Italian Longobardi), were a [Germanic tribe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples) who ruled [Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) from 568 to 774.

&gt;The Lombard historian [Paul the Deacon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Deacon) wrote in the Historia Langobardorum that the Lombards descended from a small tribe called the Winnili  who dwelt in southern Scandinavia (Scadanan) before migrating to seek new lands. In the 1st century AD they formed part of the [Suebi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suebi), in northwestern [Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany). By the end of the 5th century they had moved into the area roughly coinciding with modern [Austria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria) north of the [Danube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube) river, where they subdued the [Heruls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heruls) and later fought frequent wars with the [Gepids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gepid). The Lombard king [Audoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audoin) defeated the Gepid leader [Thurisind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurisind) in 551 or 552; his successor [Alboin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alboin) eventually destroyed the Gepids at the [Battle of Asfeld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Asfeld) in 567.

&gt;Following this victory, Alboin decided to lead his people to Italy, which had become severely depopulated after the long [Gothic War (535–554)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_War_(535%E2%80%93554\)) between the [Byzantine Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire) and the [Ostrogothic Kingdom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogothic_Kingdom) there. The Lombards were joined by numerous [Saxons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxons), Heruls, Gepids, [Bulgars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgars), [Thuringians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuringians), and [Ostrogoths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths), and their invasion of Italy was almost unopposed. By late 569 they had conquered all the principal cities north of the [Po River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po_River) except [Pavia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavia), which fell in 572. At the same time, they occupied areas in [central](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Italy) and [southern Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy). They established a Lombard Kingdom in Italy, later named Regnum Italicum (""Kingdom of Italy""), which reached its zenith under the 8th-century ruler [Liutprand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liutprand,_King_of_the_Lombards). In 774, the Kingdom was conquered by the [Frankish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franks) King [Charlemagne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne) and integrated into his [Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francia). However, Lombard nobles continued to rule parts of the [Italian peninsula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_peninsula) well into the 11th century when they were [conquered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_southern_Italy) by the [Normans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans) and added to their [County of Sicily](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_Sicily). Their legacy is apparent in the regional name, [Lombardy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy).

&gt; First, one should keep in mind that a devaluation would increase dramatically the prices of imported goods, which still dominate the Greek market. This would translate in an instantaneous impoverishment of the Greek population, which would be unable to purchase even basic goods. This development would come after three years of income reductions and profit deterioration for Greek employees and entrepreneurs respectively and while a large part of the population (currently estimated at 27%) finds itself in unemployment.

This is saying ""inflation is bad"" rather than ""deflation is good,"" but the article can be seen as an argument in favor of status quo policies - and the status quo in Greece is deflation.  No discussion of the problems of deflation appears in the article.  In fact, the word ""deflation"" doesn't even appear in the article.

If a devaluation would result in ""an instantaneous impoverishment of the Greek population,"" then wouldn't an upwards revaluation result in ""an instantaneous enrichment of the Greek population?""  Maybe Greece should reintroduce the drachma as an even stronger currency than the Euro (pegged to the Euro) and completely choke off exporters in order to raise the purchasing power of its citizens.  Of course, this might cause some jobs to be lost.  And the market would immediately punish this move by depleting Greece's currency reserves.  Well, the market is finding other ways to punish Greece now.

http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/7ec.asp

I think the last sentence may be particularily relevant to your situation:

&gt; Je ne veux pas juger au fond la thèse qui a été apportée ici et qui n'est pas autre chose que la proclamation de la primauté de la force sur le droit ; l'histoire de France depuis la Révolution est une vivante protestation contre cette inique prétention.


- In French history, a classical event of epic bullying was the Dreyfus affair. If she never heard about it, it could be good to talk about it. Unfortunately, the very famous retort ""J'accuse"" from Émile Zola is pretty hard to read without knowing the context of the affair.


- The last speech of the movie ""Ridicule"" could very well apply if you have time for a viewing. It relates the games of influence and intrigues at the court of the king Louis XVI where the goal was to ridicule your enemies. It shows bullying used as a political tool, leading to deaths and drama. The hero is a small lord who traveled to the royal court to advance the very local cause of unhealthy swamps that need to be cleaned in his fief, as they are causing epidemics. When he is finally defeated, ridiculed with a nickname that would make hims impossible to continue his lobbying efforts, he made a short speech. I could not find the script in French, but it was loaded with the feeling of harm that petty wars among the elite can cause :

&gt; Children will die tomorrow... because you ridicule me today. You envy Voltaire's wit. He would have wept. He was ridiculously compassionate. Whose turn is next? Who gets lashed with wit so sharp his whole family reels? 

&gt; You? 

&gt; You, perhaps? Unless you get the chance to lash your neighbor first.

&gt; Monsieur! Take off your mask! We all want to know who coined ''Marquis des Antipodes.'' I'm going back to my swamps... where I belong. I'll build my canals and dikes. I'll dig mud with my bare hands. Wit was the very air we breathed! Now the bloated rhetoric of Danton... rules in place of wit.

- Slightly less on topic, there was also this song, by Graeme Allwright:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1q1WHqg9l4

who talks about chains of responsibilities. ""Qui a tué Davy Moore ?"" is a song about a sport accident: The boxer Davy Moore died during a boxing match. He lists all the people who could be responsible and then makes them talk about why they can't be accused of anything. All of them end up their argument with ""I wasn't the one to hit him, you can't accuse me!"". He then finished the list with his opponent, who also explains that he can't be held responsible. This can serve as a good exercise to study the way small unethical wrongdoings can collectively build up to the death of someone. 

This can be a subtle way of saying ""sure, the girl you bullied won't kill herself just because of that, but how will you feel if you learn that she attempted suicide in six months?""",0,1391766678,null,0,1391766871,0,cf9ahxc,t3_1x7th0,t1_cf9ahxc,t3_1x7th0,null,1432292867,6,false,france,t5_2qhjz,6

Alright, it may have been a broad claim to just state ""Patriarchy"" and I apologize for using it too broad and oversimplified. What I meant was the dynamics of two groups. 

1) Teachers and Students

While growing up in the social context of the school I had quite some troubles fitting in. Because I'm male some teachers would approach me with a specific mindset, you see. They'd think of me as a troublemaker, not able to learn properly. This in turn influenced the boys all around me to fill in this stereotype. I think this is what /u/gruntmeister/ meant. I often had the feeling that teachers (male and female) would let their stereotypicial views influence grading and day to day interaction.

2) Students and students

This is where the game changes. Now being male gave me boni instead of mali. You see, in the age of roughly 12 I felt as if the need for me to be ""a man"" rose. That meaning having to be strong, never cry, don't show feelings etc. The school I was in was female dominated (8 to 18 in my class) so the smaller group of males constructed their gender even harsher to seperate themselves better, thus leaving no gray area for softer masculinity.

When things are going well, everything seems to be fine, but as soon as conditions change for the worse, countries which have not prepared for it all of a sudden are in very, very dangerous situations.

Since the late 1990s or so, global capital was extremely abundant, and there were historically low rates to borrow capital. So countries could borrow and borrow, and barely pay anything to finance their debt. Many countries, including France and Italy, borrowed enormous amounts of money, mostly to finance their public spending, and didn't really have to worry about financing their debt. 

Then all of a sudden, the credit dried up, and all the creditors wanted their money back. The countries which had borrowed during the good years were in deep trouble. 

On the other hand, countries like Germany used the good years to enact painful reforms. Everybody knows how well Germany is doing now, but 20 - 15 years ago, Germany was labelled the 'sick man of Europe.' During the global boom of cheap credit, instead of borrowing to finance expensive welfare state policies, Germany actually reformed the labour market, which was quite painful. Now it is reaping the benefits of these painful reforms, and is the leading economy in Europe.

If you take the case of Spain, it's the exact reverse. 15 years ago it was the 'golden boy of Europe.' It had high growth, low unemployment, and a booming economy. But this was masking the unerlying reality, which indicated that Spain was in a very precarious situation. Private companies, specifically developers, borrowed enormous amounts of money to build apartments, office blocks, and other buildings. Some of the projects literally made no sense: huge apartment complexes in the middle of nowhere, that they couldn't even fill with tenants. But hey, money was cheap, so why not? Then all of a sudden the money ran out, the projects stopped, and everybody was fired.

Ideally, countries should run their economies in a counter-cyclical way. When times are good, countries should focus on paying off their debts, raising taxes, and enacting policies which, in a counter-intuitive way, *slow down* growth. Then, when times go bad (which they always, inevitably do), countries are in a better position to do things like pay unemployment benefits to people that are laid off to stimulate consumption, lower taxes, and have high public spending. They can afford to accumulate debt at these times since they paid it off during the good times.

Of course, politicians typically have very short time-frames (4 years, 8 years max), and often can't resist the temptation to pursue pro-cyclical policies. When times are good, they think they will be good forever, so they borrow and spend lavishly. Then when the crunch happens, they find they are over-extended and over-leveraged, with huge debts to finance, and no money to spend.

Le PS prenait pour acquis le vote des diplomés, le vote jeune, le vote musulman, et le vote des femmes. 

Sauf que la limitation des libertés et les affaires (comme Cahuzac ou l'aéroport de Nantes) ont fait baisser le PS chez les diplômés.

Le mariage gay et autres études de genre ont fait baisser le PS chez les musulmans.

true,skgoa,GERM,Germany,"&gt; the whole world wants to be as powerful as America

This is actually an intresting tangent to look at a bit closer. Because this is what I see as the main point of misunderstanding between europeans and americans. Thing is, this is just what *americans* believe. I.e. in the US there is a strong ""king of the hill"" view on geopolitics/economics. They/you believe it's a zero-sum game and that for others to gain something you have to lose that. Obviously that means foreign intervention is *necessary*, even though nobody might like it. It also follows logically that no matter how small or insignificant it seems, you always have to look for your own advantage, becase surely the other s will do so, too. (I.e. you have to keep getting an ever higher advantage or soon you will find you have ever less.)

Europeans however generally don't supscribe to that worldview at all. We belive in cooperation and that the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts. Trade makes both sides richer. Helping others and giving up (economic) power in the short term garners goodwill and will result in advantages for all of us down the line. Potential enemies shouldn't be struck down before they become powerful enough to challenge us, they should be turned into friends for our common benefit.

We look at the US and think ""why could someone ever want to meddle all that much and be that paranoid?"" while americans look at us and think ""how could you ever be that care-free and apathetic?"" 

I have my own opinion on which of those worldviews is the correct one but more important is that these two vastly different perspectives exist and lead to strife.

Listen, no one forced any of the countries to join the EU. Joining or staying out of the EU is an extremely important decision for any nation. These sorts of decisions aren't taken willy-nilly, on a whim. Countries dedicate years of time and conduct hundreds of different studies, by some of the most intelligent people on the planet. They exhaustively comb over every single factor, and spend years debating the pros and cons of joining, and weigh the costs versus the benefits. 

In every single case, bar none, if a country has decided to join the EU, it was because after years of painstaking research and studies, it was proven beyond a doubt that the benefits of joining the EU were greater than not joining. Likewise, certain countries deemed the costs of joining higher than the benefits, and did not join. But oddly enough, those countries are in the minority. And for many of those countries, not joining was not done for economic reasons, but historical ones (Switzerland and to a lesser extent the UK, have long had policies of detachment and isolation, and are very wary of joining any international organization). So they decided not to join, or to join only partially, more for historical and political reasons, rather than real, concrete economic cost/benefit analysis. 

I do know that the City of London, basically the financial hub of the UK which generates the majority of the UK's profits, have intensely lobbied for the UK to stay in the EU. They ralize that they would lose untold billions of Euros if the UK were to leave the EU. So that in itself says a lot.

I'm not an academic scholar, and I can't really go into the deep details of the hundreds of studies. And neither can you. What we can agree on, though, is that men far, far smarter than us *have* looked at the numbers and done the math, and the vast majority of them realized that it was in their country's best interests to join the EU.

In other words, there is no money involved and the challenge is much greater -- so of course the US doesn't actually want to put forth a serious effort.

The US is greedy and wants countries under its influence. I don't dispute this all. But has it ever occurred to you that the most effective way for the US to influence others is for them to democratise and liberalise said countries? Look at their closest allies: the overwhelming majority are liberal democracies, more often than not with heavily American political involvement historically.

And for what it's worth, Ukraine borders multiple US treaty allies and the leaders of those countries have all publicly called for American involvement.

It really amazes me that the European Union can demand that Yulia Tymoshenko be released and all these other conditions of a trade agreement, but when the Ukrainian government goes into full authoritarian mode, starts squashing the voice of the people and completely takes any agreement at all off the table, when all bets are off and there's nothing to lose, the European Union doesn't do fucking shit, but murmurs of condemnation of the government that don't actually mean shit or help solve the crisis at all.

Washingtonian here (and expat in Brussels):

I study international relations in Washington DC, and live in Brussels. I can say that in american policy circles, there is a distinct feeling that the European NATO powers should pull their weight more effectively within the alliance. I've heard it said by experts on both sides of the atlantic, that there is resentment that European allies may be free-riding a bit on their alliance (vis-a-vis America's asian allies for example). 

In particular, this refers to

1: military contributions are usually very tiny, and unable to act independently, even in the European neighborhood. (e.g. Libya, Kosovo).  France showed that they can go it alone when they need chase Al-queda across the Sahara, but I think that's about it for the moment. 

2: Open provocation of the Russians. This increases defense costs for the alliance (which are borne mostly by the US), and complicates US relations elsewhere. It is really not appreciated when Eastern NATO countries provoke Russia. in 2008, they basically demonstrated that they have the military capability to cause some serious trouble in their near abroad, and wrap-up hostilities *before american forces even arrive*. SO please....DON'T PISS THEM OFF. 

3: Be nicer to Turkey. They are the no. 2 military in NATO and they occupy a really strategic piece of geography. We all need their strategic cooperation. It's is really is really not appreciated when countries like Denmark provoke Turkey. If they would decide tomorrow to declare either a neutral stance, or a pro-russia stance, it would severely complicate international matters in three separate regions of the world. So frankly, America needs Turkish cooperation waaaay more than Danish cooperation. Denmark should not be making the alliance more difficult to hold together.

You talk all this shit about the evil United States, but we're talking to the Ukrainian President, and we're talking to the Ukrainian Opposition Leaders, and we're trying to bring them to the table to negotiate and to give the opposition a voice in the government. 

And you think that's wrong? This isn't just realpolitik, it is, but it's also morally right. It's helping the Ukranian people maintain their voice, maintain their say in government so it doesn't end up like another bullshit authoritarian dictatorship under Russia's sphere of influence. 

And if you looked up the sanctions, and were actually knowledgeable about them, you would know they directly target the people in power who are pushing for this authoritarian bullshit. It's not a broad sanction again the entire Ukrainian nation, as that would be fucking stupid, and you're misrepresenting the process completely in a attempt to peddle your Pro-Russia propagandistic bullshit like you have been.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"My prediction for this legal advice is:

(1) The starting point will be customary international law on succession of states.
 
(2) Customary international law distinguishes between (i) the case of the break up of USSR (in which Russia was viewed as a ""continuator"" state, taking on the former USSR's treaty obligations and rights while other successor states such as Ukraine were viewed as new states, not taking on the former USSR's treaty obligations and rights) and (ii) the case of the break up of Yugoslavia, in which all the successor states were viewed as new states, even Serbia which wanted to be viewed as a continuator state.

(3)  Assuming the UK breaks up into (a) Scotland and (b) rUK, while Spain breaks into (a) Catalonia and (b) rSpain, in both cases (a) will be viewed as a new state, while (b) will be viewed as a continuator state. That is to say the model that will be followed will be the break up of the USSR rather than the break up of Yugoslavia, on the basis of size of population and size of territory. The consequence of this is that rUK and rSpain will maintain the treaty rights and obligations that UK and Spain had, while Scotland and Catalonia will start again from scratch.

(4) The consequence of this will be that neither Scotland or Catalonia would automatically be members of the EU while both rUK and rSpain would.

(5) Both Catalonia and Scotland already apply EU law on their territories and their citizens are already EU citizens. Therefore the accession arrangements could be entirely different from the accession arrangements of other acceding states (e.g. Macedonia and Serbia). Rather than a lengthy process of accession, the process could be an extremely speedy one. It would be possible, for example, to time Scotland becoming a member of the EU with Scotland becoming independent from rUK, so in practice there would be no time in which Scotland would not be part of the EU.

(6) In order to become member states, every other existing member state would have to accept Catalonia and Scotland into the EU. Thus, rSpain would have a legal right to reject membership of the EU by Catalonia. (Of course rUK would have a legal right to veto Scotland's membership, but it is inconceivable that rUK would use this right as Scotland being in the EU would be in rUK's interests. What rSpain would do in the case of Catalonia is much less certain, though there would be a lot of geopolitical pressure put on them not to veto.)

(7) As a new state, Scotland would not automatically inherit the UK's existing opt-outs (of most interest its opt out of the euro and its opt out of Schengen), whereas rUK, as continuator state, would automatically inherit those opt-outs. In order for Scotland to benefit legally from those opt outs, it would need to negotiate them with the EU and get every other Member State to accept them. (I expect that Scotland might succeed in negotiating these opt outs and rUK in particular will be keen for them to get the Schengen opt out. This is all a bit uncertain though.)

(8) Even if Scotland does not get de jure opt outs of the euro and Schengen, it might well get de facto opt outs (like Sweden has in relation to the euro). Though obviously this statement of fact will not be in the legal opinion.

Obviously, this is the EU we are talking about and also a sensitive political issue as well as being a question of law. So perhaps they will deliberately not be completely clear. However, I would be surprised if the advice contradicts what I have written.

EDIT - I made a few edits....

Perhaps it will, hell, to be honest it probably without a doubt will, you're right, but it will effect the people it sanctions more, so there's also a damn good chance, or at least a damn good hope, it will bring them to the negotiating table with the Opposition and actually get them to concede some *actual* reforms.

Because I wanted to know more I looked up the curriculum for history in my Bundesland.

The first time it's done here is the 9th grade.
&gt;Thema 25 Nationalsozialismus und Zweiter Weltkrieg

They assigned 15 hours to it. (that's about 1/3 of 1 school year)

At the end of the 9th grade there are two topics the teacher can choose from to do, one of them about the history of jews in Germany (which begins in the middle ages I guess).

&gt;Längsschnitt 9/1 Medizin in der Gesellschaft

&gt;ODER 

&gt;Längsschnitt 9/2 Geschichte der Juden in Deutschland 

Both of them with 8 hours.

Then again in grade 12 there is half a year dedicated to the parlamentary democratic system and the NS regime.

Désolé d'aller à contre-courant, même si je suis quand même très concerné par les libertés numériques, je pense que tous les articles qui critiquent les juges se plantent complètement. Critiquez la loi si vous voulez, mais le juge l'a vraisemblablement appliquée, et correctement.

1. Bluetouff (que j'aime beaucoup par ailleurs) a trouvé des documents via Google. 
2. Il les a parcourus.
3. Il a compris qu'ils n'auraient pas dû être accessibles.
4. Il les download en masse.
5. Il en publie des extraits sur son site.

Contrairement à ce que plein d'articles disent, il n'a pas été condamné pour 1 et 2, choses tout à fait légales. Là où il a merdé, c'est qu'il a plaidé que 3. n'est jamais arrivé. Il a joué la mauvaise foi devant le tribunal, et ça, c'est jamais une bonne idée. Le tribunal a compris qu'on les prenait pour des cons, et ça, pas besoin de connaitre beaucoup de termes techniques. 

Il a donc été condamné pour ""maintien frauduleux dans un système automatisé de traitement d'information"" mais pas pour ""intrusion"". La chose est possible car il y a eu incompétence des sysadmins du coté ANSE. 

Je pense également qu'il doit commettre une chose illégale en publiant des documents qu'il sait confidentiels.

D'un point de vue éthique, il assume un rôle de poil à gratter de journaliste technique mais je trouve qu'il n'a pas été réglo en ne signalant pas, avec d'assez mauvaises excuses (""ils s'en foutent de toutes façons"") aux admins de l'ANSE la faille. Il l'aurait fait, il aurait pu défendre le principe selon lequel ça entrait dans la mission d'information journalistique. Il aurait peut être été condamné quand même, mais là, l'éthique aurait été de son côté. Et je pense que dans ce cas là, la condamnation aurait été plus symbolique...

The EU is partly hamstrung by the fact that if its component countries can't agree on a course of action, then it can't act as a bloc, while the individual countries of the EU prefer not to be seen to undercut the possibility of such action by openly acting individually. 

But, again, there's kind of an assumption that the EU *should* be actively engaged, and that it will lose something if it is not, or that the EU should get engaged because a proportion of Ukrainians want it to be engaged. I'm not sure that interference in the Ukraine is what's best for the EU, either with respect to itself, or with respect to its dealings with Russia. Ukraine isn't a prize the EU can necessarily win at this point, or necessarily even a prize at all. It's unstable, poor, and corrupt - sufficiently poor that it will be a drain on Russian resources, not a gain, and Russian/domestic economic management isn't about to turn it into some kind of Eastern Wirtschaftswunder. 

I'm not sure who gains from helping push things in the direction of a severe east-west divide in the Ukraine. I don't see that the EU does, and I don't see that Ukraine does either.

As to Russia flexing its muscles in its former colonies - well, why wouldn't it? What's France doing but the same?

Where and when? 

&gt;The thing is, we know climate change. We know what we can do about it and we are doing it. But we don't know what to do when shit goes downhill. When there is an accident, there will be hundred thousand up to millions of deaths, and there would be nothing we can do about it.

Do you know how many people died in Fukushima due to radiation? Zero. Not a single person died due to the radiation. Yet Fukushima was essentially the worst possible scenario that could happen. At best, a couple of hundred people will die in the following decades due to increased cancer incidence. Most of the people who died in Fukushima died in the panic and evacuation afterwards. Yet even that number is only in the thousands. 

According to WHO, only around 4000 people died in Chernobyl. 

The more significant things are the clean-up costs, not the deaths: Decommission and clean-up of Fukushima is estimated to be around 100 billion USD.

I don't know where you have heard such fear mongering, but I can assure you, severe accidents are virtually impossible in German nuclear plants, and unless someone goes blow up a nuclear bomb inside the reactor or something like that, nothing that is even 1/100th of Chernobyl can happen.

Meanwhile, in Europe alone, 22 000 people die prematurely every year due to pollution from coal plants. The deaths from climate change will be even higher.

It is of course ultimately the choice of the German people. If they want to not have nuclear energy, then democracy says that there will be no nuclear energy in Germany. In that case the German people must understand that this will mean that Germany has to be prepared to pay the likely high prices of using renewable energy to replace not only fossil fuel energy, but also nuclear energy.",0,1391778038,null,0,false,0,cf9ccmx,t3_1x63gv,t1_cf9ccmx,t1_cf8x8wm,null,1432293740,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

In '73, in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War, [OAPEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_Arab_Petroleum_Exporting_Countries) resolved to cut oil production 5% monthly ""until the Israeli forces are completely evacuated from all the Arab territories occupied in the June 1967 war...."" The embargo would last for some five months before it was lifted in March 1974. This was a decision of countries whose economies relied mainly on income from oil. The aftereffects of this decision lasted for the rest of the decade and it was one of the main reason for the end of the [Golden Age of Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_economic_expansion).

Russia could place an oil/gas export embargo on the EU and use its oil/gas production as political leverage too. And I think such a decision would create far worse damage to the economy of the EU than the economy of Russia. IMO, Russians have the upper hand.

1. Hätte der Täter wissen müssen, dass der Kinderwagen der Familie gehört. War das überhaupt der Fall?

2. Wenn er diesen Fakt wusste, dann wohnte er wahrscheinlich auch dort. In dem Haus wohnten mehrere Familien und jede von denen hätte durch den Brannt sterben können. Eine Akute Gefährdung bestand meiner Ansicht nach für jedem im Haus, lebte der Täter selber dort hätte er sich mit Absicht selbst in Gefahr gebracht. Deswegen ist es für mich auszuschließen, dass die Absicht den Kinderwagen anzuzünden direkt in Verbindung stand, die Migrantenfamilie zu töten.
&gt;Fünf weitere Personen wurden schwer verletzt, weitere 26 Personen wurden mit leichten Verletzungen in Kliniken eingeliefert oder im Großraumrettungswagen ambulant behaltet.


3. Außerdem müsste das Ziel des Anzündens gewesen sein die Migranten die dort wohnten überhaupt zu schädigen.

4. Wahrscheinlicher ist es, dass sich jemand wegen dem sperrigen Kinderwagen im Hausflur störte, die Nerven verlor und seiner Meinung nach eine gerechtfertigte Beseitigungsmaßnahme vollzog (das Anzünden des Kinderwagens). Es gab schon genug Streitigkeiten wegen solchen Sachen, die sogar vor Gericht landeten.
http://www.mietrecht-az.de/doku.php/themen/kinderwagen

5. Wahrscheinlich ist es auch, dass Kinder die dort im Haus lebten mit Feuerzeug oder Streichhölzern gespielt haben. In ihrer Leichtsinnigkeit und wie Kinger eben sind, haben sie versucht den Kinderwagen anzuzünden. Aus einem Spiel entwickelte sich Ernst und ohne es sofort zu Erkennen, haben sie einen Brannt ausgelöst. Möglich sind auch Silvesterkracher, die in den Kinderwagen geworfen wurden und dann zum Brannt führten.

6. Ganz unwahrscheinlich ist es natürlich nicht, dass es sich tatsächlich um rassistische Motive handelte. Aber wie erhält man zu einem Mehrfamilienhaus um 20 Uhr Zugang? Postboten oder jegliche Dienstleister sind da nicht mehr zugange. Der/Die Täter hätten entweder einen Schlüssel haben müssen (was dann bedeutet, dass sie dort wohnten), die Haustür war offen oder sie haben sich gewaltsam Zutritt verschafft.

Ich halte es für sehr Gefährlich, sich bei solchen Dingen direkt für die sich selber einfachste und passendste Lösung aussuchen, die wohlmöglich noch dem eigenem Weltbild entspricht. Man sollte an solche Sachen objektiv rangehen und keine voreiligen Schlüsse ziehen.

It is a problem created in Westminster and is unique to Scotland (must admit to complete lack of knowledge as to the situation in N Ireland and Wales). No other EU member state has a *much larger* neighbour who speaks the same language and has such a divergent policy on the level of student tuition fees. Belgium has the much larger France to contend with, however the difference in fees is minimal as [the table in this article](http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2013/03/04/paying-for-higher-education/) shows (figures slightly out of date). Similarly Austria has Germany as a neighbour, but again the level of fees are minimal in both countries. So the impetus for French or German students swamping the Belgian or Austrian university systems to take advantage of lower fees just does not exist. It is England that is the outlier with respect to the level of student tuition fees.

My guess is that this will be a major part of the EU membership negotiations. Scotland's share of the EU rebate will be probably have to be conceded; the EU giving some opt out for this may be the compensation sought and the EU may be quite willing to give this up.

Personally I think that in the end, rUK would accept a currency union with Scotland. There would be lots of complaints and arguments, but I think in the end rUKers (I suppose I can't say English here...) are pragmatic and it is likely that poundzone would be a sensible solution.

There are other possible solutions too though - like the quasi poundzone that UK and Ireland had for a while.

If rUK and Scotland do negotiate a currency union, with the Bank of England being shared by rUK and Scotland then it would need to be very tightly managed. If the Bank of England was ultimately responsible for the liabilities of Scottish banks and perhaps also Scottish sovereign debt, then Scotland and rUK would need to agree a policy on budgets and deficit levels (a bit like the eurozone now has with the fiscal compact, though probably even tighter and more managed).

And, really, what is the point of Scotland disolving the union England only to enter immediately into another union with England in which once again England controls what Scotland spends? Its not very exciting!

and the object and purpose of the treaty, the participation of any other State in the treaty must be

Nee, hätte er nicht. Da in dem Haus laut Artikel ausschließlich Migranten wohnen, würde es bei einem rassistischen Brandanschlag in jedem Fall ""die Richtigen"" treffen. Damit erübrigt sich auch zweitens.

Zu drittens: wenn man einen Brand in einem Haus legt, hat man wohl in der Regel die Absicht, die Leute dort zu schädigen... (außer es waren z.B. Kinder).

Zu viertens und fünftens: wie kommst Du darauf, dass Nachbarschaftsstreit wahrscheinlicher ist? Das müsste dann ja jemand aus dem Haus gewesen sein. Dass jemand in seinem eigenen Haus Feuer legt, ist natürlich möglich (genauso wie es Kinder gewesen könnten), aber nicht unbedingt wahrscheinlicher als ein rassitischer Anschlag.

Zu sechstens: auch z.B. ein Pyromane hätte sich Zugang verschaffen müssen. Wenn ein Postbote morgens reinkommen kann, würde ich mal vermuten, dass das auch abends geht. Außerdem kann man einfach klingeln (hab mich ausgesperrt, will was abgeben, ...) oder jemanden abpassen, der gerade rausgeht etc.

Dass es ausgerechnet ein ausschließlich von Migranten bewohntes Haus getroffen hat, legt ein rassitisches Motiv natürlich nahe. Wie man alleine aufgrund dessen sich der Sache aber so sicher sein kann, dass zu einer Demo aufgerufen wird, ist mir allerdings auch schleierhaft... es gibt ja durchaus noch andere Möglichkeiten.

Aus bitterer Erfahrung: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-lGpu1h4D0 

Außerdem ist es bei der Brandserie in von Flüchtlingen bewohnten Gebäuden seit letzem Jahr nur eine Frage der Zeit bis dort Menschen sterben. Auch wenn dieser Brand einen anderen Hintergrund hat (und niemand stellt in Frage dass dies der Fall sein könnte), es zeigt was bei jedem dieser Brände hätte passieren könnte und in Zukunft auch immer wieder passieren kann. 

&gt;Hätte der Täter wissen müssen, dass der Kinderwagen der Familie gehört. War das überhaupt der Fall?
&gt; 
&gt; Wenn er diesen Fakt wusste, dann wohnte er wahrscheinlich auch dort. In dem Haus wohnten mehrere Familien und jede von denen hätte durch den Brannt sterben können. Eine Akute Gefährdung bestand meiner Ansicht nach für jedem im Haus, lebte der Täter selber dort hätte er sich mit Absicht selbst in Gefahr gebracht. Deswegen ist es für mich auszuschließen, dass die Absicht den Kinderwagen anzuzünden direkt in Verbindung stand, die Migrantenfamilie zu töten.

In dem Haus leben knapp 40 geduldete Flüchtlinge, Obdachlose und andere in Not geratene Menschen, direkt dahinter noch mal 80. Wieso meinst du dass ein Täter irgendwas über den Kinderwagen wissen muss? Die ganze Spekulation macht für mich keinen Sinn.

But they only one who is doing something is Russia. That's the difference. Also, the division itself is mostly the result of Russian propaganda. Until 2004 nobody felt it really. It was first brought up by anti-Yuschenko black PR team from Russia who decided that it was the most effective way to mobilise voices for Yanukovich, by creating 'us vs them' notion (it's not a conspiracy, it's a fact, those guys were pretty vocal on this occasion afterwards).

You see, the United States was specifically bombing military units that were partaking in ethnic cleansing, while trying not to target civilians, although like I said, collateral damage happens. 

The military and paramilitary units were partaking in ethnic cleansing, where their entire intention was to kill and massacre civilians. 

So NATO bombings can't be considered massacres, at all really, in the context we know it. :)

It's the Human Rights Watch number, see e.g. http://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/nato/Natbm200-01.htm . I'm giving it because it was actually admitted by NATO officials. Yugoslavian sources give a higher count.

&gt; And I don't think you quite understand the difference between collateral damage, and ethnic cleansing. You see, the United States was specifically bombing military units that were partaking in ethnic cleansing, while trying not to target civilians, although like I said, collateral damage happens. The military and paramilitary units were partaking in ethnic cleansing, where their entire intention was to kill and massacre civilians. So NATO bombings can't be considered massacres, at all really, in the context we know it. :)

Yes it does. Massacre means ""an indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of many people."" Dropping explosive material on people's heads is pretty brutal, and when you end up killing both civilians military, it's quite indiscriminate. Indiscriminate + brutal = massacre. *I don't fucking care* that yours was politically-motivated and theirs was ethnically-motivated. A slaughter is a slaughter.

""Collateral damage"" is really no different from ethnic cleansing. Both of them refer to people being killed by other people for the only crime of having been in the wrong country at the wrong time.

It's also pretty fucking presumptuous to call it ""collateral"". Collateral damage is when you kill a bunch of dudes and your mom gets killed in the process: that's why it's collateral -- you killed a lot of dudes (so the other side griefs), but you also killed your mom (so you're not thrilled about it, either!). NATO bombings killed no NATO personnel, so none of the damage was collateral. If NATO actively cared about not killing civilians you'd think it would have been better at, you know, not bombing houses.

&gt; But dude, you're right, I'm sure the U.S. getting involved through NATO had absolutely no effect in stopping any of that shit. You're totally right dude, they just stopped and worked out their differences one day because of their own free will, not because of any outside influence, specifically from the United States. :) Ah, you're so clever. lol

Ah, yes, of course. Thank God we have the US to stir fire with the sword. Had it not been for the divine intervention of democracy, Latin America and the Middle East would have been ravaged by civil and international war instead of being the peaceful, corruption-free  paradises they are now.

Yeah, maybe, the left are famous for their infighting. Still more likely than in Russia.

&gt; CNN is just the intersection of both, not an alternative.

So? American media consists of 3 TV stations, that's what you think? Do you even realise what website you are on?

&gt; How likely is it for an independent to become president, yes even mentioned in the media?

Yes, I remember how all our independents got to debate Merkel and Steinbrueck in our last election. Not to mention all the TV debates Putin had to endure. Really tough to run for office there.

&gt; When media destroys Bachman's career, is that an actual political act or showbiz? Had anyone cared about Clinton getting head if it wasn't for his too social leanings?

What the fuck does this have to do with freedom of media in Russia?!

&gt; Imagine the whole German media landscape consisting of two Bilds, one for the SPD and one for the CDU.

Except, that's not how the American media landscape looks like. And Democracts and Republicans in America are much more diverse than CDU and SPD are, you know? Romney, a Republican, introduced a universal healthcare system to Massachusetts while Democrats scrapped some parts of Obamacare that were passed in MA.

&gt;Get rid of all other parties through the electoral system (which'd be unconstitutional, in Germany), turn the dial to right.

a) I think you misunderstand Duverger's law: two parties in a district doesn't mean two political options nation wide. In the UK, the two parties can be Tories vs. Labour or Labour vs. LibDem or whatever. In America, it's usually but not always Republican vs. Democrat and even then it's R vs. D normalised to their location: the race in Texas is different from the race in Maine.

b) No shit, other countries' laws might be unconstitutional in ours. It's almost as if they were written to comply with another constitution that isn't ours.

&gt; That's, roughly speaking, the US.

No, it's not, you're just completely clueless. The political system in America is completely different from ours and their parties as organisations are not anywhere near as important as ours.

Wanna know how the Russian system is like in contrast? Putin and his buddies run the show! Everything else doesn't matter unless it doesn't contradict what Putin and his buddies want. The end.

...and you sound like you get your Russia fix from Fox News.

&gt; So? American media consists of 3 TV stations, that's what you think? Do you even realise what website you are on?

It's about the general landscape. Noone who reads the wsws would buy into the mainstream, anyway, they have a tiny audience, so why bother with them, they're inconsequential. Such media exists plentiful in Russia, too. It's about controlling whatever media the population that is necessary to stay in power watches. The rest is unimportant in the grand scheme of things. In that sense, the media in Russia is no less concentrated on the Kremlin as it's on the two parties / big business in the US.

And, no shit, Russians can access Reddit, too (though most use Russian websites) The Kremlin is no worse than the CSU, in this case.

&gt; Too many still believe in the need for a strong leader.

And they're right. Russia would devolve into a complete Mafia state if it wasn't for someone trying to keep some notion of government alive. The possibilites are the communists, who fucked up royally, the Mafia is hilariously bad idea, the military too, what's left is the intelligence service. Who are, right now, in power. They care more about Russia prevailing than pesky, short-sighted moral issues, though. They certainly won't give up power in favour for people who can't ensure Russia's survival. Like, random example, the Pirate Party, who are a joke when it comes to power basis, and would be putsched away by other forces the second they'd be elected into government.

Getting sick from using air conditioning, changes in temperature is not true in my opinion. The only thing it can cause is that your body gets some sort of a sudden heat shock if you get into hot air out of your too cold air conditioned car. This heat shock causes a sudden drop/raise in your blood pressure and can make you faint if your circulatory system is in a bad shape or if you have drunk too less water and your body is a bit dehydrated.

If my sore throat is serious I always went to the doctor to get meds or a diagnose. For the usual ""Halskratzen"" I would get some ""Hustenbonbons"" and maybe drink some hot tea. Hot tea is actually good for your body and it can contain helping herbals which can be therapeutic for your throat or your respiratory system, sometimes even for your stomach.

The interferrence in a sovereign country? The Americans are pissed off we're not all gungho in picking a ""team"" and supporting a ""side"". 

Fuck that, just because it's in relation to Ukraine makes it no less of a disrespectful, arrogant, typical cold-war attitude slur 

Maybe the EU top officials would rather play the long game which is working - portray the EU (rightfully) as a reasonably prosperous place with arguably the most freedoms and human rights in the world rather than take the US/Russian approach of black mailing/arming whichever faction that may or may not bite them in the arse later. If you noticed all the other ex-communist countries were begging to join the EU. The perception of prosperity and wealth is already at the back of the minds of people in Russias satellite states. 

Here's a hint: The Cia funded the Muhjadeen and Osama Bin Laden against the Russians and later basically merged into America's biggest threat - al qaida. 

Maybe ""indecision"" should not be confused with patience or not being reckless. The Ukrainians in the west generally see the EU as something to aspire to. The long game of hearts and minds is happening by the EU simply existing. Advocating interference and implementing interference will work against this mindset and is why the Ukrainians are protesting so hard - because they see Russia as interfering in their country. 

You do not play Russias game when trying to bring ex-communist states into the fold.

Non, juste parce que c'est un être humain.

&gt;Dans une démocratie la liberté des uns s'arrête ou commence celle des autres. En ce qui me concerne je trouve que la liberté des rwandais de faire leur deuil dans la dignité est plus importante que celle de Canteloup de faire une blague débile.

Je ne vois pas en quoi Canteloup empêche qui que ce soit de faire son deuil. Si des représentants du peuple Rwandais souhaitent critiquer le sketch de Canteloup ils sont libres d'écrire une lettre ouverte et de la transmettre à un grand quotidien pour exprimer leur propre opinion sur le sujet et je la lirai avec intérêt. 

&gt;Ils sont mieux placés pour savoir si la blague est drôle ou pas.

Bien au contraire ils sont les plus mals placés pour juger de ça. Il y a une raison pour laquelle on ne fait pas juger un meurtrier par la famille de ses victimes dans une démocratie.

&gt;Je pense qu'un humoriste est capable de faire rire avec tous les sujets mais encore faut-il pour ça avoir du talent, ce dont manque beaucoup les humoristes français d'aujourd'hui.

Oui, et je suppose que tu es l'étalon ultime à l'aune duquel on juge ce qui est drôle ou pas ? L'humour est quelque chose de hautement subjectif. Je ne trouve pas Canteloup drôle, cela ne m'empêche pas de considérer qu'il n'a pas à s'excuser pour son sketch.

So here is *my take* on **Germany**:

according to the [latest polls](http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/europawahl.htm) about 7% would vote for the AfD (that is our euro skeptic party). But it is save to say that there is a lot more skepticism on how things are going that just those 7%. 

The big banking crisis of 2007 and later sacred a lot of people and although Germany recovered quicker than many others, People are still very afraid that we could return to that situation. 

Many sensationalist newspaper articles and some populist parties (like the AfD) sow a lot of  distrust in the government. It does not help that the current Euro crisis is hugely complex and the government has failed on many occasions to explain why they are taking the steps they are taking.

People either get very confused and scared, or they seem to pretend nothing bad is going on at all and pretend everything is fine. 

But there is a very wide consensus, that the European Union and by extension the Euro is a positive thing that benefits us and that should be kept intact. 

There is no way in hell Germany will leave the **EU** and many people feel it is essential for keeping good relations with our neighbors (France and Poland especially). There is no essential criticism of the EU, but people do want reforms to prevent the same mess happening again.

Angela Merkel and her past government is often criticized for not taking the necessary steps towards these reforms. They are fixing the symptoms not the core problems. 

Things are a bit different when it comes to the **Euro**. Many people wish we still had the Deutsche Mark, but I think most realize that we can not easily go back to it now. 

The bailouts for Greece are hugely unpopular but there is no alternative in sight. 

Merkels support for austerity is somewhat popular, because Germans in general seem to have a big fear of debt and inflation. Many historians argue that that goes back to the economic crisis in the 1920s.

The Social Democrats campaigned during the last legislative period to move away from austerity and grant more economic stimuli to southern Europe to get the economies there going again. But they still voted along the governments discussions in parliament out of fear that doing nothing would be way worse. 

I think their suggestion to move away from austerity had only very limited success with the voters. 

People do realize that something needs to be done to help Southern Europe, but they are afraid that Germany would end up paining for all of it, and that would cost German workers some of their income, which did not see any big raises in the last couple years.

It is interesting that German voters have lately been against (!) tax breaks in Germany out of fear the government would fall into too much dept. Instead higher taxes for the very wealthy are still somewhat popular. I think it is possible to interpret this as austerity that Germany and the German voters inflict on themselves.

Angela Merkel's previous coalition partner, the Free Democrats (FDP) campaigned for lower taxes for working people in the election 5 years ago, but instead lowered taxes for big hotels once they were in government. This has been seen as breaking election promises by many people and as a result they did not even make it into parliament after the last election. 

I personally thing we need Europe-wide solutions but Europe is too busy fighting and critiquing each other to come up with any. 

Now the new course of the CDU/SPD government does not seem clear yet, at least to me. 


**EDIT**: Holy shit that got way longer than I intended. Don't take what I wrote here as absolute fact, it is just my take on it and I am sure that some people will disagree. But feel free to reply if you want me to clarify some of these ramblings :)

**EDIT 2**: here is another [link to a poll about the upcoming European Election](http://www.infratest-dimap.de/uploads/tx_nosimplegallery/SF_Europawahl_03.png)

**Edit3** I added another passage about the German discussion about tax levels and the Free Democrats  because I think it is somewhat relevant to this. That's it, not touching this post any more.

I get that much. However, should Europe push yanoukovich out of the gov; What do you suggest happens next ?

I suspect the main reason Europe doesn't move is they want their usual plan with a planed exit, and publicly known so they'll be able to play ""cards on table"" and won't get blamed for foul play.

- Tymoshenko is still in of jail, and even if she was freed she'd probably need some time to get back to speed. You don't just jump from the dungeon to the olympus, it doesn't work.

- Klitshko is inexperienced and lacking a serious continuity/fixing plan or a serious number two. I mean is opposition colleagues are fine, but none of the opposition top dogs are presidential material, you know it. They'd be decent minister but alone they are screwd

- Who else ?

The plan seems to be to let the protest calm down, wait for elections, kick out yanou' and vote for the 2nd name the ukrainian will pick in the election behind or before him and/or use Tym' if they can get her out of jail, which doesn't seems likely either now.

You seems to regret they don't pressure, yeah, so, who or what should they aim for in the end ? Revolutionario are something but you need a plan for continuity instead of just asking the gov to get kicked out like spartaaaa. And lets be polite there's just no clear cut plan offered there. 

Why don't you pick a plan/candidate/whatever ""evident"" choice and wave it below the EU leaders instead of just wondering why they don't violate half a dozen convention, standing international agreements (which you underlined yourself), to interfere one way or another and more or less openly override another country on their inner politics when they're half at loss and want to avoid too pissing off the russian for no good reason ?

&gt;I napoletani invece non gesticolano, per una volta,

ahahah, è divertente perché sei uno stronzo :)

C'erano pochissime persone nei dintorni, solo un tizio si avvicina con calma. Un ragazzo, in alto a destra, sembra muoversi a passo spedito verso la scena e tutti si precipitano subito fuori dal bar (?) dove si trovavano. La signora subito si rialza.

Hai ignorato praticamente tutto il commento di /u/liaisons_dangereuses

&gt;e gli astanti si guardano attorno con l'aria da ""eh, che ci vuoi fare, è capitato, nessuno ci poteva fare niente"". 

Come evidenziato, il ragazzo di colore prova a fermarlo e poi anche un uomo che lo stava tenendo si distrae (perché convinto che l'altro lo tenesse sotto controllo) e prova ad afferrare il motorino all'ultimo. L'anziano signore davanti a tutto discute con l'altro per ciò che è successo (cosa un po' distante dal tuo ""eh è capitato"", come se nessuno se ne fregasse).

Personally I have no problems being asked about our past or be associated with it. It's a simple formula, either the other person is an idiot and a response is futile, or the other person is just uninformed and I can correct him/her.

No big deal. I've heard from exchange students (Germany -&gt; USA) that they were asked if Hitler still reigns over Germany or if it's really ok for her german parents that she's going to prom.. with a black dude. Most people have no mean intentions or are wilfull ignorant. Correct them, move on and make it a non-issue.

It was meant to be a comic response, with serious points. The point about Booth's article as satire btw, I would argue would be more valid if it had been published in the comment section rather than the ""international news"" section. 

Regarding its comic intent, the article as a whole had far more jokes than the Norwegian section, which began by bringing up a mass murderer and linking him in lazy fashion to the new government and then Nowegians xenophobia in general. (ha ha?!)

I mean, I guess one could call that satire, but regardless it reinforces existing misinformation that the British public were fed after the Norwegian election. 

Thing is, and this is why I thought it demanded a semi-serious response, small countries get little press coverage in the UK, so those articles that people do read, constitute disproportionately to peoples' knowledge about particular countries. 

And there were huge numbers who read Booth's article seriously. Reading tweets, there were incredible numbers who wrote stuff along the lines ""OMG I will never think of Scandinavia the same again"". Already in the UK, since the election, people ask me frequently what its like to live in such a racist country.

Second, the indivisibility of the Spanish state is stated in the constitution. 

PSOE has not stated what exact changes would it propose, nor has anyone else, the general idea is to change the State of Autonomous Communities into a Federal State, which would change many of the current competences, giving some new ones (referendum included) and taking away some others.

There are recent changes in the discourse of CiU nationalists, watering down their claims, calling for all Spaniards to vote, specifically after they had asked for a 10Bn € loan from Spanish Treasure last week to be able to pay payrolls and suppliers.

It is likely that ""no"" will win the day in the referendum, so therefore the question will not even arise. 

If Scotland does decide to vote for independence, it will definitely be in rUK's interests for Scotland to be in the EU. There is a small risk that another member state (perhaps Spain) vetoes Spanish membership, but I think this is very unlikely.

The terms of Scottish membership are the really interesting question here. Will Scotland have to give up its share of the UK rebate? Will Scotland get an opt out of Schengen?

I disagree with you here because Scotland already has some very well established and successful companies that already export a lot to the UK and to the EU. Scotland also has most of the oil. Provided Scotland negotiates sensibly and makes sensible policies, there is no reason why Scotland wouldn't be a very successful strong economy immediately after indepence a bit like Norway, Sweden and Denmark are, or how Ireland was briefly and how it would have stayed had they not joined the euro. (!) Having England next door actually benefits Scotland and will stay a benefit whether or not Scotland votes for independence.

If I were Scotland, I think the best way for them to succeed would be to reduce corporation tax rates (like Ireland has done) to encourage a lot of inward investment that might otherwise have gone to rUK.

Well, if ya can, tell me more.

&gt; They'd think of me as a troublemaker, not able to learn properly. This in turn influenced the boys all around me to fill in this stereotype. I think this is what /u/gruntmeister/ meant. I often had the feeling that teachers (male and female) would let their stereotypicial views influence grading and day to day interaction.

Why are males in Germany seen as troublemakers?  Here the stereotypes like that are broken down more by race, unfortunately.

&gt;This is where the game changes. Now being male gave me boni instead of mali. You see, in the age of roughly 12 I felt as if the need for me to be ""a man"" rose. That meaning having to be strong, never cry, don't show feelings etc. The school I was in was female dominated (8 to 18 in my class) so the smaller group of males constructed their gender even harsher to seperate themselves better, thus leaving no gray area for softer masculinity. 

Oh yeah I get ya.  The problem is, women don't want a man who isn't a stoic warrior, but admittedly I act more feminine at times than masculine, and people have even made assumptions I'm gay in the past because of it (I'm straight as an arrow).

true,MartelFirst,IDF,Ile-de-France,"C'est extrêmement grave en effet. C'est une grande différence qu'on a avec les pays anglo saxons. Les meilleurs comédiens anglo saxons ont souvent comme fond de commerce l'humour noir, et offensant. C'est génial, surtout lorsque l'on comprend bien que leur intention n'est pas raciste, ou sexiste, ou quoi que ce soi. Parfois en regardant ces sketchs anglo saxons, je pense à quel point leurs blagues feraient scandale en France, et ça me fait de la peine que la plupart des français n'ont pas l'expérience de ce type d'humour, parce que peu de comédiens français oseraient aller dans ce sens. (quelques exemples : [Anthony Jeselnik](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAUUSHpUYrg), [Louis CK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CJkiwXcvaA)... et j'en passe).

On avait peut être Coluche, Desproges, ou les Inconnus à l'époque. Mais encore, c'était gentillet, et plutôt de la parodie du racisme (ou autre), que du véritable humour noir. Et depuis en France on s'est vraiment coincés du cul.

Dans le même genre de censure contre l'outrance qu'on a en France, le débat sur les religions. Si on veut bien critiquer l'église catholique occasionnellement pour des raisons historiques, en général c'est super mal vu de critiquer les religions. Autrement, dans les pays anglo saxons, des scientifiques ou ""militants athées"", comme Richard Dawkins ou [Sam Harris](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDMOxjHIt0U), peuvent facilement attaquer une religion (dont le judaïsme et l'islam), sans provoquer un scandale national. J'ai l'impression que si un intellectuel public disait les choses qu'eux disent, mais en France, les médias réagiraient de manière tellement scandalisés, qu'un Manuel Valls serait contraint de faire un discours mentionnant à quel point c'est ""dangereux"", et qu'il faut respecter les ""religions de paix"", qu'il combattra ""l’intolérance"" et j'en passe. 

Il y a un an ou deux, je me souviens qu'il y a eu scandale parce que quelqu'un a dit que certaines civilisations sont meilleures que d'autres. Bien sûr que c'est vrai! La civilisation occidentale est meilleure que, disons, les Talibans. C'est plutôt dangereux de les mettre à un niveau d'égalité! Aux USA par contre, même les gauchistes sont prêts à le dire : [Bill Maher](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhvhNZC51gY)

Well, once it became clear that every representative in every state and federal government got it, there would be a rush as to who could deal with it first. Nobody wants to be ""the guy who got reports of abuses and never acted on it:"" ask the Catholic Church.

&gt; Or ""patriotic"". You know who's action were also called ""treason""? The actions of the American founding fathers...

The founding fathers tried to reconcile the British motherland with increased autonomy for the colonies before turning to demands for independence (i.e. ""treason""). They didn't jump straight from ""loyal subjects of the Empire"" straight to ""we're our own country fuck you.""

&gt; You should be far more upset about the NSA. Which is actually committing crimes against you.

From what I can tell from over here it's purely economic (the situation hasn't been all that great in Bosnia for a long time). And the tipping point has apparently been reached in parts of the country. The reason it's mostly Bosniaks protesting is IMO that even though the three ethnicities aren't exactly segregated or anything but they do tend to gravitate to their own group more, especially when it comes to reaching a consensus on these bigger stuff. So far only Bosniaks have critical mass (worth mentioning they only have Bosnia, whilst Croats can get Croatian citizenship and Serbs can be kept obedient/quiet by making them think about other stuff such as independent Republika Srpska and Serbia etc...). Bosniaks seem to be in the worst situation (or a situation most likely to make them act), but they can't really blame the other ethnicities for it, it's just how things are. As for whether the protests will spread to other parts of the country or not I don't know, but I don't think it will lead to ethnic tensions (unless some hooligan does something unrelated to the protests*, and even then probably not) in fact it might unite all the people of Bosnia against their politicians.

true,SirEdwardCat,null,null,"Hola! I'm an American in my junior year of college who just arrived in Madrid for a study abroad semester earlier this week and absolutely love it here! 

I know this may seem like a crazy thing to be considering after such a short time here...but I've met some Americans who moved here after graduation and teach English. They can afford to live in Madrid through this work (which is apparently in abundance) and claim its the best decision they've ever made. As someone entertaining writing aspirations, afraid to get ""stuck"" in a soul-sucking 9-5 job in an American city, this seems like an insanely attractive option--the opportunity to live in a wonderful city, actually afford rent (compared to NYC, where I'm from, Madrid rent seems dirt cheap), and split my time teaching English and focusing on my writing. 

So my question: Am I wrong in thinking of this as a viable post-graduation option? I'm sure there are many factors I'm not considering, but it seems to me that this opportunity would be fantastic. Also, considering I'll be living here for the next 5 months before entering my senior year, are there some particular things you think I should pay attention to prior to making this life-changing decision a bit down the road?",0,1391808568,null,0,false,0,cf9p4za,t3_1x8tb4,t1_cf9p4za,t3_1x8tb4,null,1432299900,1,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,1

true,GolemGorgor,ZZZZZZcamembert,Camembert,"Commençons doucement par un peu de lecture : j'ai donc lu *La huitième couleur* de Terry Pratchett et j'ai... En fait je n'ai pas vraiment d'avis définitif sur ce livre. Je m'attendais à autre chose, un peu plus drôle peut-être, je ne sais pas. En même temps, cet univers était vraiment très intéressant, délirant mais jamais vraiment ridicule, au final j'ai apprécié ce livre mais il n'était pas du tout ce à quoi je m'attendais. J'achèterai probablement sa suite plus tard histoire de me faire une meilleure idée de la série à laquelle il appartient.  
Niveau films, assez calme également, j'ai regardé [Super](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1512235/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), en gros c'est un l'histoire d'un mec, normal, ~~blanc quoi~~ assez banal et sans grand intérêt. Sa femme le quitte pour aller dans les bras d'un gangster/trafiquant de drogue joué par Kevin Bacon. Le type banal dont j'ai d'ailleurs déjà oublié le nom est un peu taré sur les bords et après un rêve à peine bizarre il se décide que finalement ce serait super d'aller punir les méchants qui trainent dehors. Après s'être fait un costume bien ridicule il part tabasser des gens avec une clé à molette et est vite rejoint par une fille d'une vingtaine d'années, tout aussi tarée que lui. Bref, c'est un film de super-héros sans pouvoirs et bien plus trash que ce à quoi je m'attendais, bien plus trash que Kick-Ass et finalement il n'est pas vraiment mauvais, mais il n'est pas fabuleusement bon non plus. Il n'est pas non plus vraiment drôle, c'est assez étrange parce que le sujet en soi nous donne envie de rire mais tout le film ainsi que ses personnages sont relativement sérieux. Bref, je le recommande si vous voulez regarder un film assez bien fait, mais ne vous attendez pas à vous poiler avec ce flim.  
Niveau musique c'est plus chargé, comme d'habitude :  
 
 * [La Fiesta De Los Cuatro Fantasticos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvURTY1yQnc) du groupe Argentinien Paissano. Du bon son comme je l'aime, ça donne la pêche ;
 * [What I'd Say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT5wkWxBkP8) de Hound Dog Taylor &amp; The Houserockers, je ne sais pas quoi dire sinon que ça passe tout seul, encore une musique qui donne la patate;
 * [Ubalwa Ne Chamba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q9G5kWB5K8) du groupe Zambien The Peace. C'est un mélange vraiment très surprenant entre ce que j'imagine être des instruments traditionnels de la Zambie et des guitares électriques ce qui donne un très bon son;
 * [Sonder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHbiu_Jdx0s) du groupe britannique Nomadia;
 * [The Snowstorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1FtL4uIQ0c&amp;list=PL20AFBBA826803494&amp;index=1) d'un compositeur dont je n'avais jamais entendu parler avant, Sviridov. C'est vraiment une excellente découverte;
 * [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM4y_QLnXsk) du groupe finlandais Kingston Wall, j'ai l'impression de n'écouter presque qu'un seul genre musical, mais quand j'entends ce genre de choses je ne peux pas arrêter de chercher dans cette direction;
 * [La Gran Batalla Del Mediterráneo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YGPzqs9km0) du groupe Salvadorien El Ático, on aura bientôt fait un tour du monde avec tout ça, il ne me manque plus qu'un groupe d'Océanie, d'Asie et d'Amérique du nord et je suis bon;
 * The Groove du groupe Stone Giant, qui viennent des US, on est bon pour l'Amérique du nord;
 * On finit par un groupe français, La Femme, avec l'album complet [Psycho Tropical Berlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y_nP8GGGdY), je ne peux que vous le conseiller, une très bonne découverte.

Dere is also in Danish, but seldomly used. We do use the genitive form of it though, ""Deres"", which is more or less our version of ""ваша"", meaning it's very formal, or used for 3rd person plural.

Buuuuuuut I think my Slavic grammar troubles could be settled by getting some actual education in either Polish or Russian(those are the ones I know most of).

And we got our own endings, present tense, add -r to the end of the verb. Trouble is it can be hard to actually hear, whether or not it needs an -r for some words like, ""køre"" or ""høre"", basically the words that ends on -re in the infinitive form. A trick many learners use, is to substitute the verb with a verb that doesn't end on -re in infinitive. Usually it's easier to look at it and say ""do I say ""at"" or ""jeg"" before?"" though.

Resultat	Victòra catalana i establiment de les repúbliques militars del Ducat d'Atenes i el Ducat de Neopàtria

Years 1305, 1307:

the war was on Bizantine empire's land and it resulted on the foundation of the militar republics (since we were like that, founding republics before it was cool) of [Athens Duchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Athens) and the [Neopàtria duchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Neopatria) (literally, neo-motherland), basically conquering them for the Aragonese Crown.

The war was a pillaging and exterminating venjance for the treason of the empire and murder of Roger de Flor, the general of the Companyia Catalana d'Orient (a bunch of [badasses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almogavars) that roamed around doing mercenary stuff, but always loyal to the country)

I agree on the tourism part, but I feel your point is a bit contradicting? Shouldn't a country that would appreciate the tourism host it rather than a country that can host, but doesn't appreciate it? 

On the other hand, why should now Norway host it? We're a small country, and the Olympics our second time in 1994. Your country had it in 1992. Germany in 72. Switzerland? Sweden? Austria? Is it really our turn?

get mad. see if my heart rate deviates from the norm. i guess at the end of the day you're right. you do have to live with the stress of russian tanks rolling down the street claiming ownership of your life. i will go to sleep in my comfy, comfy bed.
