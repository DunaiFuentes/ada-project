You may condemn the above posters, but they truly have your best interests at heart - Germany is, at the moment, one of the most liberal countries in the whole of Europe. The CDU are more liberal and, arguably, left-leaning than the Democrats in the USA.

They're not Sweden, but they're not far off - essentially, the Nordic model is just German principles applied on a smaller scale, plus a few additional values.

Whether you ""fail"" or not, trust the above commentors: You will be miserable here, coming here as an immigrant yourself (something you heavily condemn) on schemes you oppose that have been implemented by the German government and which have little-to-no opposition from the German people; as well as realising that few to no people here share your views.

Let me guess, you heard about the little village of Jamel and decided you'd make it your home, am I right? I can't see any other reason why someone of your disposition would move to Germany, a country where they will be (rightly) openly ostracized for expressing their views.

___

&gt; Only liberal turds and muslims immigrate to that shit hole.

Germany has a large Turkish diaspora, and Berlin has a reputation for being one of the most ""hipster""/liberal/bohemian cities in the world.

I don't know why, but it's somewhat reassuring to see someone of your kind who doesn't automatically assume that Sweden is a so-called ""homogeneous"" country, but Germany is far more heterogeneous than you imagine it to be (particularly Frankfurt, the business capital, and the place where a so-called ""overqualified"" person like yourself is more likely to want to go rather than Berlin).

___

&gt; Sweden is the best example of the failure of feminism and political correctness.

Give examples, and I will give examples where Germany has adopted similar policies.

On that note, Mr Overqualified, provide quantitative indices to back your points, and we will respond by empirically proving your position as invalid. If you'd prefer, I could provide many such indices in favour of Sweden not being a failure in any sense of the word, if you want me to start.

___

Once you put your rich upper-class bitchiness and arrogance away, maybe it'll sink in that maybe, just maybe, we aren't saying this to make your life difficult because we are so-called ""liberal turds""; we're saying this because someone of your disposition is actually not going to fit in very well here, and will make themselves miserable living here.

---

&gt;

&gt;In the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), __stand-your-ground law__ removes a duty to retreat from the elements [self-defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense). The concept sometimes exists in [statutory law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_law) and sometimes through [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law) precedents. ""Stand Your Ground"" laws effectively extend the [Castle Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Doctrine) to any place someone has a right to be.

&gt;Forty-six states in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) have adopted the [castle doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_doctrine), stating that a person has no [duty to retreat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_to_retreat) when their home is attacked. Twenty-two states go a step further,  removing the duty of retreat from other locations. ""Stand Your Ground"", ""Line in the Sand"" or ""No Duty to Retreat"" laws thus state that a person has no duty or other requirement to abandon a place in which he has a right to be, or to give up ground to an assailant. Under such laws, there is no duty to retreat from anywhere the defender may legally be.  Other restrictions may still exist; such as when in public, a person must be carrying [firearms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms) in a legal manner, whether [concealed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concealed_carry_in_the_United_States) or [openly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_carry_in_the_United_States).

Talking about Spain the entry level for software engineer with some brains and English  is 1,500 euros/month before taxes at Valencia. And around 2,000 euros/month at Barcelona(the rest of Catalonia is at the lower threshold), Basque Country and Madrid. And lower At Southern Spain. It goes to 1,200 euros/month at Extremadura and Andalusia. That's before taxes, people tells his income after taxes often (/u/justgohomealready may be doing). But the salaries at Portugal are the lowest in Western Europe.

If you are thinking about moving to be a software developer in Europe you will be better off at Romania than Portugal or Spain.

However, the things that he says about the public servants being mostly true need to be taken with a grain of salt.

* That pension is the maximum pension paid by the government(similar to the Spanish one) to non-politicians. Reserved for university tenured professors doctors.. and people at the the highest possitions of the public services. Many public servant retirees are paid less. The ones with high salaries get high pensions, the ones with low salaries get low pensions. And they have seen pension freezes and stuff, but way less that the current workers or jobless.

In the last year around 85% of our small clients closed their business and the big ones merged their portuguese offices with the spanish ones, lefting us with not enough income to pay for all the taxes that our business had to pay, so we had to close.


I know a lot of people that used to work in architecture or design jobs that are facing the same situation, and the only solution we have, is to go fing a job somewhere where our talents are needed and we are payed accordingly with our skills and experience, the portuguese marked is this areas is full and the companies use a lot of unpaid interns fresh from college.


Also because we both were the owners of the company we dont receive any kind benefits for being unemployed.

1. [Amsterdam Canal Belt](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/KeizersgrachtReguliersgrachtAmsterdam.jpg)

Amsterdam, capital of the Netherlands, has more than one hundred kilometres of canals, about 90 islands and 1,500 bridges. The three main canals, Herengracht, Prinsengracht, and Keizersgracht, dug in the 17th century during the Dutch Golden Age, form concentric belts around the city, known as the Grachtengordel. Alongside the main canals are 1550 monumental buildings. The 17th-century canal ring area were placed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2010.

2. [Delta Works](http://www.dutchtouristservice.nl/contents/media/delta_works_private_tour_1.jpg)

The Delta Works is a series of construction projects in the southwest of the Netherlands to protect a large area of land around the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta from the sea. The works consist of dams, sluices, locks, dykes, levees, and storm surge barriers. The aim of the dams, sluices, and storm surge barriers was to shorten the Dutch coastline, thus reducing the number of dikes that had to be raised. Along with the Zuiderzee Works, Delta Works have been declared one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

3. [Limestone Caves in Limburg](http://www.vakantieparken-limburg.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/grot_valkenburg.jpg)

I'm not entirely sure about the history of the Limestone Caves, but as far as I know, they were places where limestone was dug up. The caves are about 250 km long. After that they were used for various kind of activities and these days it's a tourist attraction in a unique landscape for The Netherlands! :)

4. [Flower Fields: Keukenhof](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8w2GYaK7Trw/UWVlifufdNI/AAAAAAAAXl4/4O06Kx45Hjg/s1600/3+Keukenhof+Garden+Amsterdam.jpg)

Keukenhof is an unforgettable experience for people of all ages. The historic park with more than 2700 trees covers an area of thirty-two hectares, full of tulips, hyacinths, daffodils and all the other spring bulbs. The floral displays in the park and the unique flower shows in the various pavilions are a glorious visual feast. The world famous Keukenhof Gardens in Lisse are opened from mid-March until mid-May.

5. Royal Palaces:

6. [Strijp-S](http://www.coenensaettele.com/files/2513/8495/5696/CoenenSaetteleArchitectsSAN540.jpg)

Strijp-S aims to become the 'creative heart' in Eindhoven. Eindhoven is also known as Holland’s design city. The area consists of several historic buildings and used to be owned by Philips, still a major Dutch corporation. The terrain was transformed into an extraordinary urban area accommodating a unique mix of facilities for living, working and relaxing in creative surroundings. It has an imposing, robust and industrial look and feel.You will find creativity and culture all over Strijp-S, which has become a place for artists, designers, theatre-makers and musicians to showcase their work. Eindhoven also hosts the yearly Dutch Design Week.

7. [The Windmills](http://www.rvdaalenfotografie.nl/uploads/9/3/0/0/9300854/1733295_orig.jpg)

Ofcourse I need to include the dutch windmills. The first windmills were invented in antiquity, but it was the Dutch who really hit it off with this wooden giant. In a flat country, where the wind always blows, windmills sprouted from the ground like mushrooms. They were used to mill, saw, pump and press. The production of boards, paint, oil and paper, as well as bread and mustard – among other things – depended on windmills and wind. In addition, windmills were used to pump the water out of lakes and to keep reclaimed land dry.

Italian manufacturing [maintained competitiveness](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/10/competitiveness) since the crisis.

Lower wages, low value of euro, and the frugal german mentality, has meant lower German demand. Overall in the euro there is very low aggregate demand. Before the Euro crisis the excess aggregate demand was absorbed by American debt, this is no longer the case. The peripheries cannot trade their way out of the crisis if their is low demand for their products. As Germany is a free country. you can neither force them to spend, or raise wages.

The conventional way to deal with a competitiveness problem was currency devaluation (usually natural). Debt decreases, cost become more competitive, export increase which off sets restructuring. The UK have been very successful with this.

Portugal does not have the option to devalue. Cutting will be counter productive. For this reason all monetary zone (in accordance with Optimum Monetary Area theory) have outright monetary transfers as a stability mechanism to ease readjustment. The euro-zone is the abnormally.

Fakt ist: Das [ukrainische Parlament](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werchowna_Rada), welches die [Übergangsregierung Jazenjuk](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabinett_Jazenjuk) gewählt hat, kam bereits 2012 zusammen. Des Weiteren war bereits im Vorhinein _überall_ die Rede von einer **Übergangsregierung**. De Facto war die Übergangsregierung Jazenjuk vom 26.Februar bis zum 24.Juli im Amt - also knapp vier Monate. Neuwahlen sind für den Herbst 2014 angesetzt.

Die *russische Propaganda* des Faschistischen Putsches machte aus 3 Sovoboda-Ministern dieser Übergangsregierung eine gesamtfaschistische Regierung. Das hatte zum Zweck die ukrainische (Übergangs-)Regierung in ihrer bloßen Existenz zu illegitimieren, um wiederrum die Krim-Annexion -ein militärischer Gewaltakt- zu begründen.

Es ist halt schon clever, eine Regierung einfach faschistisch zu nennen. Denn da niemand Faschisten mag, kann eine faschistische Regierung ja kaum volkslegitmiert sein. Und da eine ukrainische faschistische Regierung die russische Minderheit diskriminieren würde, wäre es einem anderen Staat natürlich erlaubt einen solchen Zustand zu beheben.

tl;dr: Die Faschismus-Propaganda diente nur dazu, die [Territoriale Integrität](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territoriale_Integrit%C3%A4t) der Ukraine kurfristig anzuzweifeln um auf der Krim Fakten zu schaffen.

Nachdem die paramilitärischen rechten Kampfverbände bei dem Putsch von Janukowytsch als Mittel zum Zweck benutzt wurden und letztendlich eine große Rolle bei der Maidanrevolution spielten, war es auch selbstverständlich dass diese Milizen sich nicht ohne Probleme mit geringerem Abspeisen lassen, da sie doch als Mittel zum Zweck die Basis des Putsches bereiteten.

So, what do? Na ganz einfach: Gib den Faschos ein paar unbedeutende Ministerposten in der Übergangsregierung und sie halten die Fresse - wie wenn man einem Baby einen Schnuller gibt. Das wurde schon gut gedeichselt ich muss schon sagen. Statt in die nächste Regierungs-/Staatskrise zu schlittern und ein handlungsunfähiges Parlament zu erzeugen -geschweige denn Russland den blanco-scheck zum Einmarsch zwecks Staatstabilisierung zu geben- nutzt man einfach die Rechten und ihre Einfältigkeit aus. Das ist echte Krisen-Realpolitik! Respekt, dass das so gut geklappt hat.

Jedenfalls: Es war allgemein bekannt, dass die Faschisten eine signifikante Rolle bei dem Maidanprotest spielten und jeder der sagt, die ""Mainstreammedien"" hätten nicht über den rechten Sektor der Ukraine berichtet, der lügt. Das ist schon seit der rechten Beteiligung an der Maidanrevolution in den Nachrichten.

Man darf sich imho auch gerne über die schwachsinnige und sinnlose Einziehung von rechten Soldaten beschweren, gar kein Problem. Ich denke die Ukraine hat solche Kämpfer nicht nötig, aber vllt sind die auch ganz froh, wenn die in den Kämpfen mit draufgehen... ein paar Neonazis weniger...

Wer sich aber über die [""*Faschisten in Kiev*""](http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/2d8l7f/ukraine_neonazis_im_h%C3%A4userkampf/cjnb9i0) mokiert, der muss mit seiner endgültigen und maximalen Diskreditierung rechnen.

**1** [Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore](http://teatriemusei.ovest.com/_img_key/527-prodotto_grande-cattedrale-santa-maria-del-fiore.jpg), 160 meters long and 91 meters high at the wonderful [cupola](http://www.foliamagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/La-cupola-di-Santa-Maria-del-Fiore-1024x657.jpg). A [photo] (http://www.architetti.san.beniculturali.it/image/image_gallery?uuid=bd93df55-8c4b-47ef-895e-5a44e41b4c58&amp;groupId=10304&amp;t=1339080687778) of the facade and I just love the [floor](http://www.foto-blog.it/img/pavimenti-duomo-firenze_eos-30d_48289.jpg)


**2** Staying in Florence, we have [Palazzo Vecchio](http://gaiaspia.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/palazzo-vecchio.jpg) (bet ya climbed that on Assassin's Creed II, too), that was home of the priory of Florence, of the short lived parliament of the Republic of Savonarola and from 1865 to 1871 of the Italian parliament. It has the beautiful [salone dei cinquecento](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Firenze-palazzo_vecchio_24.jpg) and a lot of other [rooms](http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/37404798.jpg) that I don't remember.


**3** Just [Venice](http://www.titianinn.com/files/titianinntv/themes/titianinntv/html/imagebank/photogallery-2/333.jpg), I hope I will go there someday...


**4** What do we have for Rome? We have A LOT of things! But not Vatican city (since it is not Italy). So, let's take something I think is gorgeous: the [Altare della Patria](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Piazza_Venezia_-_Il_Vittoriano.jpg) also called the Vittoriano, in honour of Vittorio Emanuele II, the first king of Italy.


**5** Now, a moment for nature. Going south in Puglia, we have [Santa Maria di Leuca](http://www.salentoreview.it/wp3/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/VA0V2214-santa-maria-di-leuca-cmykPicc.jpg); however what is beautiful about it is not the hamlet, but the [creeks](http://www.viaggi-lowcost.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/coste-del-sud.jpg), the [caves](http://static.turistipercaso.it/image/l/la-grotta-degli-innamorati/la-grotta-degli-innamorati_q9wse.T0.jpg), the [things](http://www.bebsantalucia.it/foto_animazione/7.jpg) and the fact that people make blurry photos that would otherwise be perfect for this.


**6** [Alps anyone?](http://www.collezionedatiffany.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/trentino-alto-adige_2fk7k.T0.jpg) Just look at how badass these [flowers](http://www.guida-turistica-trentino-alto-adige.it/trentino/images/trentino/paesaggio-montano-della-Val-di-Fassa.jpg) are! (Honeybadger don't give a shit) Also the 40 meters high [piramidi di terra](http://www.hoteldolomiten.com/img/slider/erdpyramiden_01.jpg) formed from alternating periods of rain and drought on the terrain. Thanks erosion!

Let's do this: you choose your number 7! I want to know new wonderful places (and I don't have enough time to search something else)

Edit: oh yeah, and we have a city that is called ""San Pietro in Bagno"", which translates into ""Saint Peter in the bathroom""

**Bigger Edit:** Since my choice regarding number four isn't well percieved, I will ask you to feign that, instead, there is [Villa Farnesina](http://www.grupporemimmobiliare.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/farnesi.jpg), it has beautiful [rooms](http://dseuropeanvacation.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/dsc_3529.jpg) painted by Raffaello and his school; on the ceiling is depicted the [horoscope of Agostino Chigi](http://www.foliamagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Baldassarre-Peruzzi-Loggia-di-Galatea-volta.jpg) (the first owner). There is a legend on that one room I linked: it is said that Michelangelo went there and chose to show off to his rival by painting [himself](http://ciaotutti.nl/wp-content/uploads/Michelangelo-Villa-Farnesina.jpg)... though it is not true. It was made by someone else.

Another room of this villa is the [loggia di Amore e Psiche](http://www.artemagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/loggia.jpg) (I think it is Cupid and Psyche in english), where is [depicted](http://www.foliamagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Raffaello-Loggia-di-Amore-e-Psiche-volta.jpg) the famous latin story and symbolizes the love story of Agostino Chigi and Francesca Ordeaschi: she went from being a courtesan to marrying, in this very same room, the rich banker.

Last but not least, the [perspectives room](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HC-9HjEIrTE/U5VXXQ-xmsI/AAAAAAAADUc/85a8bx7X1bU/s1600/sala+propsettive+farnesina.jpg) where there also is a [writing](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pR8fQ4gQ7MQ/UW0JUUHSRBI/AAAAAAAAAH0/mfDXbMiYOBs/s1600/DSCN5087.JPG) made by a lansquenet in 1528, during the Rome plunder, which says ""1528- why shouldn't I, the writer, laugh?

Most important is that you make your situation clear. If you need any kind of visa or work permit make an offer that you will fill out all needed documents. 

Otherwise, you should get your CV professionally translated. There should be no mistakes in it. And language should be adapted into a form that works in the foreign tongue.

Also consider that not all companies are willing to employ people that cant speak German. Investigate beforehand if the company you are applying for is actually fine with it.

Also Im not sure how common it is in your line of work, but youve been job-hopping a bit since 2010. Thats something German employers dont always like. CV itself also has too much text in each part. Short bullet points that explain what you did under each employment are generally better. Some people prefer a small text block in front, but that is more modern. (im guessing that should be fine for web dev work)

Though, since I never actually interviewed for a job in a foreign language, other than the ones I can speak, I am torn on whether its actually better for you to use a German CV. As I said above you will only get jobs that accept non-German speakers anyway and a job like that should also generally accept English CV's.

Jacques Bainville - Histoire de France (1924)

Both of them can be considered as quite conservatives writers, as their description of the events were the oppropriate version of the history toward the ruling regime at their time.

It will give you the telling of the national novel as it is mostly and officially admitted today.

However, if you consider that ""To trust the official history is like to believe murderers on words"", you might will to read more about, especially from Henri Guillemin, a great french (counter-)historian, who died in 1992.

Here is a small text where he insisted on the dark side of the events that has been voluntary hidden.

The french revolution was ruled by the recent wealthy mens from towns (bourgeois) manipulating the poorest part of the population to achieved the overthrown of the ancient aristocracy, using it as a wild beast, but very concerned that this beast should stay heavily muzzled right after the ""coup"" succeed.

4 [Peterhof](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Grand_Cascade_in_Peterhof_01.jpg), the palace of Peter the Great built to outbling Versailles and any other European palace.

Get out.

Everyone makes the stuff in Slavic/South-East Europe, and no one is claiming that Serbia invented the stuff.

However, it's culturally more important to Serbs, than it is to, say, the Czechs. I think this is why some people are very elitist about the stuff.

Ce peuple s'était vu promettre par la France et le Royaume-Uni au lendemain de la Première Guerre mondiale, un Etat, dont ils sont privés depuis des siècles. La campagne victorieuse de Mustafa Kemal contre les Alliés a mis fin à cette espoir avec la signature du Traité de Lausanne en 1923. 

C'est une minorité ethnique très solidaire et organisée, avec une diaspora influente. Ils sont présents en Turquie, en Irak, en Iran, en Syrie et en Arménie. Avec la chute de Saddam Hussein (qui les abhorrait tellement qu'il a gazé plusieurs villes kurdes dans les années 1990, débouchant sur la création du premier *no-fly zone*) en 2003, les Kurdes ont accédé à l'autonomie dans le Nord du pays. Autrement dit, ils ont déjà un embryon d'Etat. Alors que l'Irak est dans une situation de délitement le plus total, la région contrôlée par les Kurdes fait figure de havre de paix. 

Contrairement aux islamistes, les Kurdes ne luttent pas au nom d'une idéologie, mais au nom de la liberté et de leur indépendance. Il ne s'agit pas d'une vulgaire tribu à l'allégeance douteuse comme en Libye, mais un allié de poids. Les Kurdes peuvent être perçus comme un moyen de combattre le prétendu *Califat* sans envoyer de soldats au sol. Leurs armées sont entraînées et aguerries au combat, après des décennies de clandestinité et de guerre avec les autorités Turques et Irakiennes.

En revanche, si jamais nous armons les Kurdes, j'attends avec impatience la réaction de la Turquie et de l'Iran. Les Kurdes sont 15 et 10 millions dans ces deux Etats, et la perspective de voir une minorité souvent remuante être armée par des Etats occidentaux n'est pas forcément positive.

Anyhow, now maybe you learned something about the region. Israel is only there to keep Saudis in check, that is why US is supporting and turning blind eyes to Pakistan vs Israel ordeals.

* Positif: la population accueillante, dynamique, marrante, jolie... La bouffe en général: viandes, empanadas, pizzas. Le pays: Buenos Aires est vraiment une ville à vivre, Iguazu est l'endroit qui m'a le plus impressioné par exemple jusqu'à présent, Salta/Jujuy/Bariloche sont à voir.
* Négatif: il ne faut pas y travailler. Gouvernement hyper populiste, qui parle généralement uniquement aux patriotes et aux populations mal éduquées. Je me rappellerai toujours d'un 14 juillet que j'ai passé à l’Ambassade de France à voir des petits vieux me raconter qu'ils avaient perdu le travail de toute une vie sur des décisions à la con du gouvernement. Bouffe : c'est toujours la même chose, aucune originalité. En plus, j'ai pris 10 kilos là-bas.

Angleterre:

* Positif: j'y ai un avenir professionnel que je n'avais plus vraiment en France. La qualité de mon environnement de travail est aussi très bon. Les transports en commun que je prends pour faire les trajets maison-boulot sont largement meilleurs qu'en France. J'ai accès à toute la culture imaginable à Londres. J'ai même le luxe de me loger beaucoup mieux qu'à Paris - le comble. De bons parcs assez agréables. Les impôts sont beaucoup plus simples qu'en France. De manière général, je suis beaucoup moins stressé ici même si je n'arrive pas à pointer la raison exacte, peut-être parce que tout est plus simple et les gens plus sympas. La bouffe rapide est bonne : sandwichs excellents, petits dej anglais, bouffe à emporter en général. De même, elle est généralement beaucoup moins chère qu'à Paris. Les supermarchés ouverts quasiment tout le temps. Il y a un vrai respect de l'autre ici, probablement hypocrite. Mais c'est agréable de savoir que tout le monde se fout de la manière dont tu te comportes dans la rue si tu emmerdes personne. Avoir un accent tout pourri ne fera pas que tout le monde se moque de toi contrairement à la France. M Pokora et les autres merdes musicales françaises ne passent pas à la radio. L'élite aristocratique est très cultivée et généralement avec un humour pinçant très sympa.
* Mitigés: les trains peuvent être vraiment mais vraiment nazes. Par contre, j'ai de temps en temps le choix entre plusieurs compagnies de différentes qualités. Ça permet d'en choisir une qui fait bien son boulot. Les Anglais n'invitent jamais chez eux (compensé par le fait qu'il y a peu d'Anglais à Londres). Dans une certaine mesure, l'architecture chaotique est à la fois moche et une source d'opportunité pour des projets dans tous les sens.
* Négatif: A part Londres, il n'y a quasiment rien en Angleterre qui me fait envie. J'ai habité à Sheffield et c'est un trou insupportable. Contrairement à la France où la province peut être super sympa, ici seule la Cornouailles ou l'Ecosse me tente, ce qui est assez loin de Londres. Il n'y a quasiment aucune plage sympa dans tout le pays alors qu'il s'agit d'une île ! Les restaurants : ils peuvent pas arrêter de bouillir les légumes ?

In that case, you need to do your research. I'm going to cite to you the statistics of Auslander (Foreign-born) individuals as of late-2013, as percentage of the population, in a number of major German cities. If you have doubts, you can look up the updated figures for yourself, found easily on the [German Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Hauptseite). If you want larger figures, you can also find the statistics for people with a migrant background, which likely spans so-many generations:

* Hamburg: ~30%
* Berlin: ~13.5%
* Frankfurt: ~39.5%
* Munich: ~22%
* Cologne: ~19%
* Stuttgart: ~40%

If you are looking for some ethnically ""homogeneous"" place where immigration is scarce, your best bet is East Germany, which is also coincidentally politically dominated by *Die Linke* (""The Left"").

Then again, you might say, this may just be a short-term trend, in decline following the 2008 Wall Street Crash. [Wrong](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/the-new-land-of-opportunity-for-immigrants-is-germany/2014/07/27/93464262-7eff-4931-817c-786db6d21ec8_story.html) - as the Washington Post notes, Germany has been releasing a large host of new pro-immigration measures to make migration to the country more feasible in recent years, whilst other countries have been cutting back.

But surely there is a eurosceptic, anti-immigrationist party in Germany, isn't there? Yes, Alternativ für Deutschland, and even that is softly eurosceptic. Is it popular, like all the others? Nope - in a system of proportional representation, it still has 0 seats in the Bundestag, and a mere 7/96 seats in the European Parliament. There is no indication that Germany is going to curtail its pro-immigration policy any time in the foreseeable future.

[Germany is home to the third-highest number of international migrants worldwide, and the most predominant minority ethnic group is that on the Turkish, approximately triple the size of the second largest group, which are the Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Germany#Migrant_background_and_foreign_nationality). This is followed by Italians, Greeks, Croatians, Romanians, Serbians and Russians. In other words, few to none of your so-called ""civilised"" migrants.

&gt; Sweden probably is more like Swedes + muslims + niggers.

Again, a simple search of the figures could go a long way. [Sweden's African diaspora is ~0.8% of the population, compared to Germany's ~0.6%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_diaspora#Estimated_population_and_distribution); whereas, when it comes to the Muslim population, [~5.4% of Germans are Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Germany) compared to [~5% of Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Sweden).

&gt; People in the real world don't behave like the mindless libtards on reddit.

I know, and generally most people see that as a bad thing. Here in the ""real world"" we need to put up with anti-vaxxers, people claiming that their country is something special, and racists marching about calling for genocides. 

If I'm honest, I'd rather put up with the Reddit community than try to put up with some of the uneducated masses. I'm not a Marxist, but even Marx called these idiots *lumpenproletariat* - generally, people who are so stupid, that trying to convince them of anything rational is pointless and a waste of time. People who, even if proven wrong, are too proud to ever admit that they're wrong, and would rather wallow in their wrongness than be right. I certainly hope that you aren't one of those, minus the fact that you're not a member of the proletariat, because you certainly haven't left the best first impression.

Guns are not bad, guns are tools, you either use them in a good way (like in the pictures and how 99.999% of all gun owners in Switzerland do) or you don't. You are actually blaming a simple tool and projecting your own fears into it, just think about that for a second!

Discussing this issue with people like you, that just look at this hobby by using emotions is totally useless and just a waste of time, since by being ignorant you won't change your opinion at all.

Besides, your argument is false. Everything I've seen indicates that the Ukrainian army is responsible for far more civilian casualties than the rebels are, although if you could prove me wrong I'll accept your contention. Just by logic alone, the rebels can't do as much civilian damage. They do not have much in the way of artillery, they do not have an air force and, even if they did, they have far shoddier supply lines than the Ukrainian government.

Just by that logic alone, combined with the fact that the Ukrainians have been on the offensive using antiquated Soviet battle doctrine, which has no problem with creeping artillery barrages over densely populated civilian areas, means that the Ukrainian army is most likely responsible for most of the civilian casualties.

**How do I nuclear deterrent?**

1. Have nukes.
2. Establish doctrine on how you plan to use it.

We have:  
1. Russia having nukes.  
2. Russia establishing their military doctrine regarding nukes.  
3. Russia saying so.

Ergo, Russia's nuclear doctrine is what they claim it to be. No your use of scare quotes nor attemps at false equivalences will change that fact.

The band has been active in Italy since 1980, and perform regularly in concert.

&gt;Elio also graduated on December 20, 2002 from the [Politecnico di Milano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politecnico_di_Milano) with a M.Sc. degree in [Electronic Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Engineering), after having dropped out several years previous to his successful return.

&gt;The texts of his songs are eclectic, hilarious, and sometimes political. Belisari lists Frank Zappa as a primary influence and this reflects itself in the variety of both lyrical and musical stylings.

true,Mazertyui,YAFrance,France,"&gt; most books on the revolution seem to have been written by Marxists, people arguing with Marxists

Well, you wanted a typical French look on the Révolution, you have two options:

- The liberal, Jacobin, republican, bourgeois, romanticized fairytale of the people bravely taking over the evil, useless dictator and fighting against all nations of Europe for their freedom (Michelet, that's pretty and all, but nothing to do with History) until mid 19th century.
- Then the Marxist right of reply over that.

I'll recommend the second as, historiographicaly speaking, that's the closest to what ""a modern French point of view on the Révolution"" look like. The problem is not that they are Marxist, but that for most part of the 20st century that may likely means strict respect of the Soviet dogma i.e. Robespierre is not at all a bloody dictator taking over the people revolutionary forces to ensure a personal power run by terror to accomplish his rousseauist ideology even if it's mean beheading every resistance, therefore the same can be said of Lenine, it's all but bourgeois propaganda, etc... 

I don't have an authority book on the subject on witch I could say ""this is the historical truth about French Révolution, take it as it is"" because it's still a very discuss and ideologically determinant question to date. 

EDIT: About these books specifically: the Gauchet one is a very specific one, not a big historical look-back on the period. Plus, it's a borderline philosophical essay, good luck if you want to read that in French!

I don't know the other two. By quickly looking at it, Furet was a communist and Richet a Liberal, sound like a good balance.",0,1407792584,null,0,1407793912,0,cjnghsb,t3_2d8p3a,t1_cjnghsb,t1_cjnfg8f,null,1435187946,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

They took it as a challenge, for there was a tacit consent (at least according to them) that the former USSR is a Russian sphere of influence (except tha Baltics).

The EU negotiating an association agreement with the Ukrainians was like throwing down the gauntlet to them, it was an open challenge to Russian (economic and political) influence over Ukraine.

Statement about homosexuality in the US, contains only anecdotes:

* Friend got married to her long-time fiance in a very ""rednecky"" Alabama state. The town is very country but it's close to a progressive city with a lot of regional, national and international transplants. Like Austin, but smaller.

* Girl getting married comes from a very ""country"" family. She works at a coffee place and invited her co-worker (also a mutual friend of mine) who is openly gay. He came with his date who is his boyfriend. They weren't over-the-top affectionate but were on par with most couples. Holding hands, smiling at each other, etc. It's obvious they're gay.

* This was in a Southern Baptist Church that had been around since the early 1800s. Deep roots in a rural community. Openly gay couple in a church for wedding and reception.

Nobody cared.

They got some looks... sure. They didn't get lynched. And that's a step forward from 50-100 years ago for sure. That would have *never ever* happened in a rural Southern town 100 years ago.

true,Haaveilla,Zespagne,Espagne,"Je suis à Barcelone en Espagne/Catalogne.  
**Le mieux :**  
- Le cadre de vie. La ville est moderne, très riche en culture (musées, festivals, fêtes de quartiers, artisans...). Je suis à 5 minutes à pied de la plage. Je peux prendre le métro jusqu'au terminus et faire une sortie à VTT dans les collines environnantes. Les Pyrénées sont à 1h30 de train. La météo est un bonheur (surtout venant de Paris), il fait tout le temps soleil, et en hiver  l’après-midi il fait rarement moins de 15 degrés.  
- La taille de la ville. C'est une grande ville mais qui n'est pas encore asphyxiée par sa population. Je suis rarement debout dans le métro, il n'y a pas de bouchons dantesques comme sur le périph. Du coup pas besoin de s'exiler à 1000km du centre pour vivre. le réseau de transports en commun est très efficace.  
- La bouffe catalane est très bonne et variée, et puis la proximité avec la France fait que l'on trouve absolument tout les trucs typiques français dont l'on a besoin.  
**Le moins bien :**  
- L'économie. 25% de taux de chômage, ça laisse des traces. Voir des mamies faire les poubelles pour chercher quelque chose à manger, ou des pères de famille frapper aux portes pour demander un paquet de pâtes, ça fait mal au coeur. Il y a des institutions et associations qui sont la pour aider, mais elles sont débordées. En visant le profit à court terme, le gouvernement a privatisé le gaz et l'électricité, résultat les prix ont quasi doublé en quelques années et les gens en souffrent. Les perspectives d'emploi pour les jeunes sont désastreuses. En dehors de Barcelone ou de la Catalogne il y a des zones complètement naufragées ou tout le monde a été expulsé, personne ne travaille, il n'y a plus de tissu économique.  
- La vie politique. Au niveau national, c'est tout simplement une succession de scandales divers. La vieille frange franquiste/ultra catholique qui se fait toujours entendre, bien qu'elle soit minoritaire. La récente loi sur l'avortement en est un bon exemple. Presque tout le monde est contre, mais le gouvernement fait plaisir aux extrémistes. Au niveau local c'est ""Catalogne versus Madrid"", indépendance matin midi et soir. Au delà du pour/contre, ça monopolise les débats et c'est lourd.  
- Il y a trop de français. Je sais que je fais partie du problème, mais quelque soit le lieu, il y a toujours un français dans le coin. Travailleurs ou touristes. Dans le métro, dans les magasins, au bureau, ça parle français non stop.  
- Le côté latin avec les gens qui sont ouvert et chaleureux, faciles à aborder, tout à fait. Mais si le premier contact est facile, il est dur de convertir l'essai, il y a beaucoup de fausses amitiés. En France comme dans certaines cultures nordiques, il est plus difficile de nouer contact avec quelqu'un, mais c'est durable. En exagérant, ci tu te pintes la gueule avec un collègue toute la soirée, il t'ajoute sur facebook, et le lendemain il te calcule à peine.

E' la seconda volta nel giro di pochi anni che ai vertici del calcio italiano c'è un'elezione di questo tipo: accadde all'AIA poco fa, ora succede in FIGC.

Dinamica: presidente uscente/favorito anziano, esperto, maneggione, comunque con un'esperienza non di poco conto e un buon curriculum, però che sa di vecchio e di antitesi al CHANGE che tutti vogliono nel mondo libero dal 2008. Sfidante grillino - ""fuck the system"" ""vecchio merda"" ""cambiamo tutto"" ""guarda dove ci hanno portato"" sono le argomentazioni migliori, figuratevi che i pro Albertini li chiamavano NoTav(ecchio). Tra i due candidati sceglierei sempre il primo, anche se mi fa le figure di merda, è uno che il suo lavoro bene o male lo sa fare; con l'altro è un salto nel vuoto che già parte da cattivi presupposti.

Poi c'è il discorso di chi va a favorire il candidato: Albertini avrebbe buttato tutto sul recupero del prestigio internazionale, spostando mari e monti per favorire le squadre in Champions e ranking e blabla; questo si traduce in tornare alla Serie A a 18. Quattro minuti dopo, Sky lo avrebbe sonoramente inculato e lui avrebbe dovuto rinunciare, perché non ci sono le basi oggi per imporre a Sky un accordo del genere. Fine dell'epoca Albertini.

Tavecchio, da politicante navigato qual è, probabilmente sa molto meglio come bilanciare tutti gli interessi in gioco in modo da portare a cambiamenti graduali; c'è da dire che oggi il calcio italiano è già in una fase virtuosa e di risanamento, con le società che falliscono molto meno, le grandi squadre che fanno i soldi con i pacchi tirati agli arabi all'estero, e sempre più capitali esteri che entrano ad aiutare; oggi serve solo guidare la ricrescita in modo calmo e adeguato.

I guess I'm forgoing my ""I'm staying out of this one."" comment with this one but all in all I don't think there's a single man around that doesn't have an ancestor or countrymen to be ashamed of. I don't think there's reason to fight and hate about most of the different approaches to that especially since so little of it is dictated by us personally. I just think it's important that we remember and at least strive to not repeat hence the only reason I disliked his comments was due to the 'whataboutism' which can definitely distract from this.

true,otterbaskets,NETH,The Netherlands,"I kind of disagree, I don't think it is a boring country at all. It is true that, due to the high population density, there is relatively little actual nature. Also, *everything* is planned out: Every single forest in The Netherlands has been planted and it's hard to find wild nature. However, I don't think that this means that there's nothing ' special' or beautiful about it.

On the contrary: since everything is planned, there is almost always a recreational/ nature area nearby. They are always really accessible and it is a joy to cycle through them due to the good quality of infrastructure laid down in them. And even though the Netherlands is much much smaller than a country like Argentina, you'll still find forest, heather, beaches, sanddunes, hills, mudflats, peat bogs, moors, lakes, rivers and beautiful gardens/ flower fields. Mountains aren't everything. Plus, what I find special about the Netherlands is that there's *always* a body of water nearby. We have our rivers, lakes, polders, grachten, canals, sloten and plenty of other Dutch names for bodies of water which you don't have in English running through the country, and they really make the landscape quite recognizably *Dutch*. 

Then, if you include things other than just mountains or whatever into 'sights' , your claim becomes kinda ridiculous.The Netherlands has a very rich history, leaving us with things ranging from beautiful old buildings to 5500 year old hunebedden. Then there's also of course the more modern buildings, plenty of great museums, the Deltaworks, the dikes and many other things which I personally think are not a ' boring' sight. Plus, there's always something to do. I've lived in the middle East where you maybe had a festival once a year but in the Netherlands it seems like there's always some kind of event going on and something fun to do.

Anyway, sorry for the long rant. Obviously it all depends on taste and, being from Argentina, I can imagine that you're used to quite some impressive sights. I just wanted to make sure that you've actually given the country a chance.

Can you find some source on that, because wikipedia is strange in this regard. And Romania makes almost as much as you, and since they are Orthodox I dont see how you are specific. 

&gt;Everyone makes the stuff in Slavic/South-East Europe, and no one is claiming that Serbia invented the stuff. ""Slivovitz"" belongs to everyone and anyone -- it's cross-cultural and a very Slavic drink.

I agree.

&gt;it's culturally more important to Serbs, than it is to, say, the Czechs. 

Why did you leave out the other Slavs in this area.

&gt;Thanks to the EU, ""Slivovitz"" is now the generic name, and you'll be able to buy ""Serbian"" style or ""Czech"" style soon enough. People can then decide what they like better. :)

Meh, implying you could taste the difference, I pick plumbs every year, then go with it to the kazan and make Rakia. And plumbs are the most dominating fruit in Norther Bosnia. And we liked it as much as the next guy, the only difference is that Serbs use it when somebody dies. Changes nothing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"In normal circumstances pre-euro
escudo:euro is 20:1. Typically when a soft currency was in trouble  they would either devalue naturally or through printing depending on how bad the situation is. Wages nominally stay the same but reduce in real value to a competitive level, restoring the country instantly to natural competitive levels 70% 14sco :1€. In recession wages are typically sticky and take a long time to come down to natural levels. Also in a overvalued currency debt both public and private decrease in real value. This is normal, and the risk of devaluing was priced into the bond price when sold (bonds pre-euro were seen more as an investment on a country rather than a loan.). Exports become expensive and internal products more competitive. Indigenous industries begin to substitute expensive imports, solving negative trading balances.

The country experiences an export boom which typically leads to a positive surplus. The inflation is often phased in over a few years, which encourages legitimate. purchases to be brought forward. Personal and government debt, lessens also frees up consumption in the economy. The country initially is restricted or cut out of the bond markets. This forces the government to make necessary economic reforms. Arguement has been made that a reason that restructuring has been slow in the eurozone is that the vested interests in the peripheries wages are in euros and are generally untouched. The outsider in the economy take the pain. As the economy gets going wages increase with growth.   

The UK have devalued 30% since the crisis and is preforming very well. here bloomberg being [pissy about it](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2012-07-04/devaluing-the-pound-isn-t-a-solution-it-s-default)

It is standard practice in economics. Struggling economies have always done this. Particularly effective examples would be NZ and Finland in the 80s. and Ireland in the early 90s.

In the case of being within the euro, parallels exist with countries who peg their currency to stronger currencies- which usually end in disaster. Argentina are an good example they got in trouble with their dollar peg in 1998. After 3 year of the austerity approach which only caused contraction, they default and unpegged. They grew 94% 2002-11 and real wages increased 73% 2003-13. Their current default is a squabble over 1.5bn€ and not a crisis. The economic strategy is very similar to the devaluation, except debt restructuring is done through negotiation.
Generally, countries who attempt the pure austerity model experience similar results to Europe; see Latin America 80s, and South East Aisa 90s. Those who default and devalue experience strong recovery, Iceland, Russia 00s. [Artical](http://macronomy.blogspot.ie/2012/03/equities-theres-life-and-value-after.html) Devalue and restructure debt is a standard approach to deal with debt crisis countries.
 too much to reference full but I can link anything you are interested in. 

TL/DR: Devaluation instantly reduces real value of wages dramatically to competitive levels. Real value of private and gov. debt and liabilities (eg rent) reduces. Frees up investment and ordinary consumption. Imports become too expensive, exports and substitute industries boom. Inflation causes wage inflation, income debt ratios improve. The economy gets on its feet again. This is standard economic practice for struggling countries.

* La scrittura deve migliorare -quello che vedo è monotono, frammentato e a livello di sussidiario scolastico. Attenzione: non mi riferisco alla complessità o semplicità dello scritto, mi riferisco a una sciatteria e scolasticità generale del tono e della struttura del post. Quel post non mi spiega quasi nulla se non che gli uccelli sono all'interno del ramo dei dinosauri, e nel farlo riesce a glissare sorprendentemente sugli aspetti più interessanti (come l'evoluzione delle piume *prima* dell'evoluzione degli Aves), introducendo però paragrafi come:

&gt;Suo contemporaneo è Wellnhoferia, che si distingue da Archaeopteryx per la coda più corta e per il quarto dito della zampa più piccolo.

Perchè mi parli di *Wellnhoferia*? Perchè tra tutte le specie nella linea dei dinosauri mi citi quella? Che mi frega della coda più corta? Perchè non mi dici invece che forme ci sono prima e dopo, che rami collaterali c'erano e che nicchie ecologiche occupavano, o quando compare il becco, o cose insomma che diano un *senso* alla storia che racconti?

* Sceglietevi un tema. Un tema nei contenuti o nella forma o nel punto di vista. Qualcuno ha detto giustamente in questo thread che di blog/siti di divulgazione è strapieno. Io perlomeno ne ho migliaia su Twitter e semplicemente non ci sto dietro. Se volete distinguervi, trovate una nicchia di qualche tipo e concentratevi. Fate qualcosa per cui siate ""quelli di riferimento"" per un topic o un punto di vista o uno stile. 

* Non raccontate le cose che raccontano tutti. Di cose su uccelli e dinosauri se ne trovano, di nuovo, a miriadi, raccontate meglio o peggio. Il bello e la sfida della divulgazione è anche nel cercare argomenti apparentemente noiosi od oscuri e far capire quale sia la poesia che ci sta dietro.

Aber: Bei der Eisenbahn ist Sicherheit das absolute Kernthema. Bei Gefahrensituationen können Eisenbahnen nicht ausweichen (klar) und kaum bremsen, weil Rad/Schiene extrem wenig Reibung hat. Ein ICE bei 300km hat einen Bremsweg in der Nachbarschaft von 3 Kilometern; ein Sportwagen hält auf 300m an und das ist auch schon ziemlich weit. Wenn der ""Lokführer"" auf der Strecke vor sich was sieht, kann er (überspitzt formuliert) nur die Scheibenwischer anschmeißen und aufs beste hoffen.

Wenn man öffentliche Daten über das System der Bahn schleust, hat man das gleiche Problem.

Did you read that quote, because that's the truest, most important thing to take away from this article.

Russian propaganda is a revolting insult to any civilized society, if individuals wish to seek out Russian propaganda for their own intellectual curiosity; then all power to them. But to expose the general public, most of whom will take every word the talking heads on TV say as pure truth, is socially irresponsible. It can lead to terrible conflict.

Remember the run-up to the Iraq War when certain American news networks constantly hyped up the Iraqi threat, generating a false sense of fear that terrified Americans and made it easier for Bush to sell his war? Do you not think that was immoral?

A lot of them have fairly negative opinions of Europe and see it as a racist place, except for Britain. Most of them are OK with Britain for some reason. 

Educated East Asians will always prefer Canada/America to Europe. Working-class East Asians may not care, but I doubt those are the ones you'd want in Europe anyway. 

Also, most of the people you're complaining about are 2nd or 3rd generation ""immigrants"" who were born in their countries. They are disaffected, and they voice their radicalism in this way. I wonder why cities like Toronto in North America, where over 14% of the population is Muslim, never have Muslims calling for sharia law? Or why they never have ethnic strife?

Dearborn, MI, in the US is a ~85% Muslim/Arab town, and it's pretty affluent, and there are no calls for ""sharia law.""

Die [personelle Zusammensetzung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_and_Defense_Council_of_Ukraine#Current_Membership_.2F_Composition) ist wie folgt:

&gt;Beside the President and his/hers secretary the council consists also of the Prime Minister of Ukraine, the Minister of Defense, the Head of Security Service of Ukraine, the Minister of Internal Affairs, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The head of the council is the President of Ukraine assisted by secretary whom he is allowed to appoint. In the absence of existing President of Ukraine such as between elections, the acting chairman of the council is the Prime Minister.

Also Präsident+Sekretär und 5 Minister machen den Nationalen Sicherheits- und Verteidigungsrat der Ukraine als Organ aus.

Außerdem:

1. [Andrij Parubij](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Parubiy) war **erster Sekretär(!)** des Nationalen Sicherheits- und Verteidigungsrats der Ukraine. Er hatte also nur **beratende** Funktion und effektiv **nichts** zu sagen. Selbst wenn er Stimmrecht besäße (hypothetisch, daher Konjunktiv II), könnte er sehr einfach überstimmt werden, wie oben ausgeführt.

2. Er ist nicht mehr in der Svoboda, sondern in Timoschenkos Partei [""Allukrainische Vereinigung „Vaterland“""](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allukrainische_Vereinigung_%E2%80%9EVaterland%E2%80%9C). Das macht seine Person nicht unbedingt vertrauenswürdiger und politisch vertretbarer, ich denke aber eine gewisse Kontrolle durch die o.g. Partei sollte schon vorhanden sein, was rechte Eskapaden, Alleingänge o.ä. verhindert. Ich möchte seine Person aber nicht beurteilen, weil die (Tages-)Politik der Ukraine und die Person nicht kenne.

30 anni passati tra i dilettanti, che sono l'esempio dei giochini sporchi all'italiana, tra pagamenti in nero, regole idiote sull'età dei giocatori (15enni in campo e 28enni in tribuna) e riciclaggio di denaro. 
È evidente che questo sia stato un voto per mantenere lo status quo. Nella posizione degli elettori si distinguono due gruppi ben delineati: da un lato allenatori, giocatori e squadre ricche o pronte a investire molto negli anni a venire (Roma, Juve, Sassuolo), dall'altra le serie minori, mediaset e le squadre di serie A economicamente in difficoltà o con politiche di contenimento delle spese (Milan, Inter e Lazio), decise a vivere di rendita finquando possono.

Il calcio italiano purtoppo è tuttaltro che virtuoso. Se iniziano ad esserci delle entrate per le cessioni illustri, questi soldi non sono certo reinvestiti nei settori giusti per far ridecollare il nostro campionato, che crolla, nei risultati (superati dal Portogallo nel ranking Uefa) e nel prestigio.

Mi dispiace dirlo, ma il declino del nostro calcio secondo me è proporzionalemente più significativo di quello della nostra economia. Contrariamente a quest'ultima però, è di taglia minore e molto meno complesso. Secondo me un bel reset, un vero anno zero, ci sarebbe stato bene.

Vielleicht ist Internet im Zug auch kein so großes Thema bei der Bahn, weil die Infrastruktur durch private Anbieter und Smartphon-Hype und eben LTE schon größtenteils vorhanden ist...

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"&gt;After how many years the former colonialist is no longer held responsible for ""the mess"" happening in the former colony ?

Until it's fixed. Maybe even indefinitely. It's not an easy problem with an easy answer that can satisfy anybody's nationalist victim complex. Germans were paying reparations until this very decade for the world wars and holocaust, despite the fact almost no living German had anything to do with them. It's final World War **I** reparation was paid in 2010.

&gt;Should U.K. still be held accountable for what's happening in Canada, in the U.S.A, in Kenya...?

The USA has been free of the Empire for centuries. Not an argument. Canada was a part of the British Empire that was invested in and benefited massively from the benevolent approach the Empire started showing towards its more powerful commonwealth states(Eg. Statute of Westminster). 

Not the same for its African mandates and colonies. So if there's a socioeconomic problem in Kenya that is ultimately rooted in the results of British exploitative colonial policy, and that leads to the development of a crisis rooted in those socioeconomic problems, then yes, the British government is responsible. 

&gt;Belgium in Congo

Yes

&gt;Germany in Namibia

No, that would be South Africa, who took it from the Germans and attempted to colonize/annex it for decades.

What most people fail to realize is that the vast majority of former colonies today that are in shitty states are because their colonial overlords treated them like shit, took a huge level of resources, invested nothing into developing the country and educating the population or reinvesting the money they made into the land and then bailed the fuck out the second suppressing the population became too difficult.

And what people refuse to realize is that even though they're not responsible for the exploitation of those people, they *are benefiting from it to the present day*. None of our countries would be the way they are today if it were not for all the resources we got from the colonies. I don't think a single sane person would argue that massive amounts of money was made by colonialism. Massive amounts. And it's not like we gave it back. France would not be so mighty, the United Kingdom so respected, Europe so developed, if it were not for our exploitation of the colonies. Yeah, sure, we'd still be a country mile better off than them, but they would be developing too, at their own pace, with their own cultures, and they'd be able to solve their own problems.

Not what we did. What we did was take a load of shit, drew arbitrary borders, saying ""Here's your country, sorry we ignored your self-determination and all that, just make do"" and then left, and somehow people expected it all to sort itself out.

true,Nihilumx,ALBA,Albania,"&gt; Your affirmation that East Asians think Continental Europe is racist, is bullshit and you pulled that out of your ass.

I didn't pull it out of my ass, it's just my anecdotal personal experience. Every time I tell an Asian student here that I'm from Albania, it spirals into a long conversation about how they view Europe. It's just what my experience has been, it doesn't necessitate that most Asians feel this way. But it sure looks like they do.

&gt;University of Munchen for example now offers only English masters degrees. We only need to bridge the language gap since they only learn English in schools there.

Yeah, that probably plays a role, too, but the Asian I have met do not view Europe in a great light. Also, if it's just a language barrier, why doesn't the UK have huge east Asian immigrant populations as places like Canada and the US do? It's clear that something more intrinsically cultural is going on in terms of how they view Europe.

For instance, the effect of German supply-side economics on aggregate demand and and comparative competitiveness doesn't fit into most people narrative of the euro crisis. Ecomonics is complex. 

 The IMFs own study, of 28 countries, showed that austerity alone is counter productive. This is also in line with standard economic theory. 

The established economic economic theory on Optimum Currency Zone states that a currency zone must have, similar cycles, full labour mobility(language barrier prohibit this.), and outright monetary transfers. None of which the eurozone has to any functional degree. Again standard uncontroversial economic theory and practice.

It is the euro-zone that defies standard economic theory and practice. It is completely unlike any common currency before. In terms of economic divergence and lack of structures. 

Devaluation, with reform, is the standard economic practice for debt crisis. It has worked very successfully many times. It is usual something countries that countries do sparingly. Saving do decrease in value but that is a pay off of the decision, The alternative is often economic stagnation or decline. It isn't a practice that only banana republics. The UK devalued 30% since the crisis and are doing well. It is particularly useful when the country pegged their currency in some way, and the currency is much stronger than it true economic level. 

See the history of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, that was a complete f**king disaster that was ignored 10 year later. It has a lot of parallels.

1. [The Yorkshire Wolds](http://www.yocc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Yorkshire-Wolds-13.jpg)Not as fancy or well known as the Moors and Dales, but absolutely beautiful. The epitome of ""green and pleasant land"". My parents live in a village in the Wolds, and it's so relaxing to come here from London.
2. [Stirling Castle, Scotland](http://hqdesktop.net/wallpapers/l/1920x1080/77/cliffs_buildings_historic_hdr_photography_stirling_castle_1920x1080_76075.jpg)Really beautiful. A great example of 16th century Scottish architecture.
3. [Albertopolis, London](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Natural_History_Museum_London_Jan_2006.jpg)The area of London containing the Royal Albert Hall, the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, Imperial College London, the Royal Colleges of Art and Music, the Royal Geographic Society and the Royal Institute of Navigation. Such great concentration of knowledge, history and culture in such a small area would be difficult to find anywhere else in the world, I think. My aim in life is to be able to afford a house within half an hour's walk of here.
4. [The British Library, London](http://magnacarta800th.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Aerial-view-of-BL.jpg)The second largest library in the world, and one of the UK's six legal deposit libraries. It is home to the Diamond Sutra (the earliest dated printed book from 868 CE). Aside from that, it's one of the few truly quiet places in central London.
5. [Winchester, England](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Winchester_13.JPG)The de facto capital of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Wessex which expanded to encompass the whole on England in 927 CE, making Æthelstan the first King of England. It's also a really nice town with the oldest public (private) school in England.
6. [Spurn Point, England](http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll198/haydut1200/Spurn%20Point/spurn.jpg)An interesting feature at the end of the Humber estuary, quite a nice place to go and visit, and see the ships coming in and out of the Humber.
7. [Windsor Castle, Berkshire](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Windsor_Castle_at_Sunset_-_Nov_2006.jpg)The longest continually occupied castle/palace in Europe, with the original construction dating from the Norman conquest in the 11th Century.",0,1407803375,null,0,1407803672,0,cjnm1xj,t3_2d8ou3,t1_cjnm1xj,t3_2d8ou3,null,1435190740,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Who is Russia to you? Is it the mafia government at the Kremlin or is it made up of the Russian people?

If your answer is the mafia governments, then the policies of the civilized world curtail ""Russia's"" wants.

If your answer is the Russian people, then you're statement is false because the policies of Western and other civilized societies sought to create a mutually beneficial relationship with Russia. There was talk of the transfer of technology, offers of financial resources and huge investments in Russia and in the Russian economy

That is what the Kremlin wants. Which is absurd because Russia is already a massive country and they have enough natural wealth to facilitate the creation of a happy, stable and healthy society.

These haven't really materialised, certainly not enough to off set the disadvantages. There hasn't really been a normal phase of the euro-zone. Pre-crisis was mostly an artificial boom (even inside germany), and since the crisis trade has been propped up heavily by debt. It is either an all in or an all out sort of deal. I can neither see, Germany giving up their mercantile advantage easily, Italian and Greek elites upsetting their vested interests, or the North agreeing to having a soft-euro currency, or paying the level of monetary transfers to get it functioning properly, 5-7% of GDP (figure from the 70s). A disproportionate amount of the burden would fall on Northern countries. It would be higher at the moment because of the struggling countries and also the addition of weaker new entrant countries, so maybe (10%) of german GDP? Likely? Even if they do get together it is unsure whether it is still as suitable currency-zone the economies are still very different with different needs. We don't really know.

I dont see, the euro breaking up voluntarily. The political classes are really wedded to the idea. This is a mixture of ideology, hubris, sunk cost bias, blame avoidance. The seem not to acknolwedge the damage they did, and see the sacrifice is worth is especially as they are taking none of the pain. 

The way it seems to be going is like it is clunking along blaming each other and ignoring economic reality. to breach the competitiveness gap with german the peripheries have to make massive competitiveness gains (20, 30, 40%) to do that. The countries cannot take the contraction as pure austerity. Northern Europe won't pay sufficient transfers to smooth the transition. The outlook is abysmal for Italy and France. QE doesn't always result in inflation that is desired, see Japan. If Italy or France spiral, they thing could go out of control, and result in a chaotic breakup. If they can keep the show going. The necessary requirements for a functioning OCArea is way off, and the low aggregate demand problem (caused but germany's supply side strategy) is still there. The continent could be stuck in stagnation, and high unemployment in the peripheries, easily for 15-20 years. 

As for how to get out. A country could leave but installing credit controls (to prevent or stop a bank run, and currency from leaving the country) and to switch the currency 1:1, Usually the old currency is stamped or inked to denote that it is the new currency. Then all government payment are demanded in the new currency. So taxes have to be paid in them, and government payments are made in the new currency. Some are predicting a catostrophe- [here](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/4937/economics/what-would-happen-if-the-euro-collapses/), however, there has been [69 currency break ups in he last 100 years](http://www.channel4.com/news/how-should-europe-deal-with-a-break-up-of-the-euro)- these are usually smooth. 

I think the greatest risk is staying in currency no-man's-land. Neither a full currency, nor separate currencies. Europe has lost a lot of opportunity cost in the past few years. Even Germany isn't preforming particularly well (about 0.6% growth) since 2008. The debt burden is preventing investment and R&amp;D, at a time that it is becoming ever more important globally. 20 years is an eternity in economics we could loose our place in the world it we stagnate to long.

Its ""suburbs"" (in the sense that they're on the periphery, Russia doesn't have suburbs in the American sense) are the same drab old Soviet prefabs as anywhere else.

Moscow is beginning to look better over time, but it's a mix of decrepit historical wonders and really tacky modern offices.

That's the architecture. Even in those two cities, which between them siphon the majority of the money in the country, you can still see the vast poverty. The huge illegal immigrant underclass. You will see amputee soldiers begging on street corners and homeless old ladies scraping by and barely surviving. The cities are entirely third world in terms of their huge rich/poor divide. While the two have something of a middle class, the rest of Russia is just about entirely composed of poor, mentally and spiritualy broken people with a very small upper crust.

You know, I was going to write up a whole huge post, but it's just depressing me. And that's the way it's always been. If anything, now is better than ever before. In my opinion, the culture is rotten. The institutions don't function at all, except as a bribe extraction mechanism and a way to funnel rich peoples' money to Swiss bank accounts. The country is in a state of massive decay. Life expectancy is horrendous, so is pollution. Theoretically there's universal healthcare (one of the USSR's best achievements) but in practice doctors will let you die unless you bribe them into treating you much of the time due to their low government salaries and overall sense of total corruption. Academics in the USSR were good too. No more. Poor areas have been largely abandoned by the government. Rich people just pay for their kids to get straight As, further devaluing the value of a diploma. Educated and capable people have for the most part either already left, are trying to leave, or are only staying to protect their ill gotten gains, in the case of the elite.

Heroin and alcoholism are huge, population destroying epidemics. Abortions outnumber live births by over 2:1, last I checked.

I could go on and on. The things I've seen in the villages growing up will scar me for life. In 1998 a quarter of my village's population died of cholera, a story that to your mind probably sounds more like the middle ages than today.

There is a desperate consumerism among the wealthy and just overall desperation among the rest. It's a country which has already collapsed once 20 years ago, and pretty much everyone except for political extremists is resigned to the fact that it's in a slow, probably irreversible decline.

And this is a country that is one of the richest in the world in terms of natural resources. Look at a graph of Russian GDP composition. You will find that Russia makes practically nothing, almost all industry is extractive. What few things are made are products of leftover Soviet industries. There's a reason you don't see Russian cars hit export markets in all but the poorest countries.

Basically, think of the Soviet Union. For all its terrors, it had some real achievements in terms of science, culture and social solidarity. Modern Russia is the USSR with all of those things stripped away and replaced by a small highly wealthy and very flashy elite.

Crime is bad and the police are worse than the criminals, which is to say they are largely indistinguishable from them, but armed with legal authority.

Russians have had some great achievements in the past. The problem was, Russians never had anything resembling a good or even an ok life. People cling to the past, whether the symbols, the literature or the belief in Great Mother Russia as if it meant anything. In the end, it's all a distraction while the country gets looted.

I no longer live there not because it's so bad, but because I firmly believe that it is hopeless that things will improve.

This was merely a short version of events. I live in America. Even in Russia, I lived a privileged lifestyle in comparison to the vast majority of people. Still, the stories I tell often cause my American friends to look at my with a mixture of great sympathy and horror.

In the end, it's thoroughly corrupt as a state and as a society. In many ways it is stuck in the political culture of 1914, downgraded by the influence of totalitarian communism.

People in America have dreams for their society. Maybe the right wants to return to the mythical 1950s nuclear family, God fearing utopia and the left would rather have an egalitarian social democratic utopia. In Russia, the national idea is ""we are great and we will prove it through strength."" There is no substance. In my personal opinion, and it pains me deeply to say this about my homeland, the culture is thoroughly corrupted and unable to create a modern society. 

If you have any specific questions or want a horror story, I will oblige. Check out /r/anormaldayinrussia for some examples of ""hilarious"" failures by Russia to create a functioning society. Then read [this](http://sputnikipogrom.com/politics/17848/russian-psyche/). That is the optimistic view of how Russians see themselves, and even in that view much is either worthy of derision or simply pointless. If you and I had a drink together, I would tell you my personal thoughts on it and they would be far grimmer, albeit getting at the same basic truth.

Honestly, name me an aspect of society. Any aspect of society. I will compare the Russian and American versions of it for you. You will find that 95% of the time the Russian one is much more unpleasant or badly executed by a wide margin. I'm not saying the country has nothing positive about it, it's just it has more negative things about it than any place on Earth that I've encountered. I'm sure the Congo is worse but I've never been there, and the Congo doesn't claim to be a leader of world civilization and a model worthy of emulation.

Oh, here's an upside. If you have money (and I'm talking real money), you can buy anything. Human life, immunity from the law, women by the dozens, a convoy of armored Rolls Royces with road clearing sirens to take you anywhere you go, get bottle service at the glitziest club you'll ever see in your life for $25,000 a night or pretty much anything else.

These past 15 years haven't been the worst for Russia. For the first time (largely thanks to the increase in oil prices and the fact that at least some of that money is being used to bribe the population into complacency rather than being stolen), Russians had cars, they had access to good food products, they had Apple stores. Not all of them, mind you. The vast majority of the country is a bleak and impoverished hellscape. Just the fact that some people got that is already miraculous by historical standards.

And now we're back to the old days. Food is going to disappear from the shelves, and if this Ukraine situation spins out of control (as I fully expect it to), things will get much, much worse. And why? Because the country is still under the delusion that it needs to be a great power. If I had my way, it would accept its place as America's bitch in the international world order and focus on improving the lives of its citizens, like most of Eastern Europe has done. The people disagree with me heartily on that matter. It's hard to admit everything around is failed, and the environment of propaganda makes it harder. Russians have two views essentially. Sometimes, like today, the view is that everything is great and everyone else has it worse and anyone who says differently is just spouting western propaganda. The other view prevailed in the 1990s, during the collapse. That view is that everything is horrible, but what can you do? Russians are naturally like that, and our politicians are naturally like that, and nothing can ever be done by anyone to change anything so why bother trying?

This pendulum swing between nihilistic fatalism and militaristic nationalism shows pretty much the only two states the country knows.

 The restructured bondholders are quite happy to wait, They will get paid eventually. Their bonds are actually worth more.The markets are distinguishing between  the Greisefault and a typical default. Interest rates on variety of Argentina corporate loan are now lower than the average for the year.  

The pari passu clause interpretation only applies to the US, the new bond are legislated from Argentina.The clause also will be removed from future bonds. If Argentina wait until 2015 they will not be obliged to may the restructured bondholders in full.

They are going through a rough patch, unrelated to bonds, but their underlying economy is pretty strong. 

Even if it was a full default, they are twice are big as they were the last time. If they had stayed the austerity path they were on a contractionary spiral. There was no other choice. They are moral correct on their stance.  The ability to default on unpayable debts is a cornerstone of any capitalist system. The interest that bondholder receive on bonds is the risk/reward for such a possibility.

Hey, great to hear that there's a new Ligue 1 fan out there :)

First thing I would say would be to take a look at the league official youtube channel, it's quite well done, highlights of every game/goal/save are available. I must say, as I live far away from France aswell, it's a great ressource for me. http://www.youtube.com/user/Ligue1official

Now, for picking a team, I'm gonna try to write a few words about each team playing in Ligue 1 this year. But keep in mind that, as I've been following this league for more than 20 years, I might not be a 100% neutral :P

**Bastia**: The Corsican survivor. Ajaccio being back to L2, Bastia is the only Corsican team in L1 this year. Finished 10th last season, lost their manager and some key players and their manager who took them from the 3rd league to L1 in 2 years (Khazri to Bordeaux, Landreau decided to retire) but they got Makelele as a new coach (former Nantes/Chelsea/Madrid/French NT/Paris legend, was learning the job with Ancelotti at Paris) and some interesting players (Areola, Brandao, Maboulou, Tallo). Small stadium, but always very hostile to away teams.

**Bordeaux**: Always a top 4-8 finish contender. They got a new coach, Sagnol (former Monaco/Bayern Munchen/French NT legend) made some interesting signings (Contento from Bayern, Khazri from Bastia, Plasil back from Italy), didn't lose anyone really important (only Orban to Valencia), and everybody is interested to see how Sagnol can change things in Bordeaux and try to finish at the top of the league again. Bordeaux was actually the team that ended the 7 year somination spree of Lyon a few years ago, and then went to the quarter finals of the Champion league, beating Juventus and Bayern in the group stage, thanks to key players like Chamakh (who later went to Arsenal and now C.Palace), Gourcuff (Lyon), Diarra, Diawara (Marseille, Nice), Tremoulinas (Dynamo Kiev) and Carasso (still at Bordeaux). Key players this year: Carasso, Plasil, Saivet, Diabaté. They will have a great new stadium at the end of the season.
	
**Caen**: Normandy team team that always goes from Ligue 2 to Ligue 1, stays a year or two, and then comes back to L2. They were a good team in the early/mid 90s though. They always produce quality youngsters (Gouffran, Newcastle - Niang, AC Milan - El Arabi, Grenada - Gallas who played in OM/Arsenal/Chelsea/Tottenham - Costil, Rennes) or find good young players (Hamouma/Mollo to Saint Etienne) but have to sell them after a season or two. Good signings this year include Feret (Rennes) Vercoutre (Lyon) or Imourou (Clermont) and Raspentino (OM). They also kept Duhamel, top scorer last year in L2. Nice little stadium. Expect them to beat some higher ranked teams from time to time.

**Evian**: New team with famous chairmen and owners (Danone group, Lizarazu, Zidane). I'm not exactly sure what to say for them, except that there's a few Danish players in this team, and their best player might be one of them, Wass. They lost their former top scorer (Berigaud) to Montpellier, got Bruno on loan from Lille. Their coach is always very vocal and I don't really like them :P Their stadium isn't that great also.

**Guingamp**: Interesting team from a tiny Brittany town	of ~8000 souls, with a 18.000 seats stadium that is always 90% full, with a great atmosphere. They had glorious names in the past few years (Drogba, Malouda, Candela), went back to L2 for a while, and now are back to L1 and trying to annoy bigger teams. They won the french cup last year, and therefore will compete in the UEFA League, but I'm not sure what to expect from them in UEFA, as they will probably prioritize L1.Their playstyle is rather offensive, and as for signings, I'll let /u/giggsy664 give you some inisght, he's way more qualified than me to talk about promising players in Guingamp this year :P (which might include Marveaux from Newcastle, or Baca from Lorient).

**Lens**: Club from the north of France with a glorious past. Their stadium is great and they have one of the best atmospheres in France. They always relied on their youth system (Varane, Kondogbia, Taraabt are the most recent examples) and some local signings. However, this season, things might be really complicated for them, as they're freshly promoted from L2, and had lots of issues related to their new owner and money. They can't get new signings yet because of that, and lost one of their key players, Areola (GK from PSG, on loan to Bastia now) and almost their manager (Kambouare, former PSG player and Coach, with quite a temper). They have a rivalry with Lille.

**Lille**: The other club from the North of France. And a very successfull one starting from the 00's. Once again, they rely on their academy and youngsters scouted in the area, or in Belgium. Their former coachs were Puel (now working in Nice) and Garcia (now working at AS Roma) who did great job with youngsters and sold them later to bigger leagues and clubs. Recently, they sold Cabaye (Newcastle, now PSG), Debuchy (Newcastle, now Arsenal), Hazard (Chelsea), Rami (Valencia, now AC Milan) and Digne (PSG) who all became succesfull international players. They finished 3rd last season with a new coach, some problems in attack (they even might lose Kalou in the next few weeks), but a great defense and GK (Mavuba/Kjaer/Basa/Enyeama). Players to watch this year include those last names, plus Corchia (newcomer from Sochaux), Mendes, Gueye, and Origi, the Belgian youngster (they sold him to Liverpool for a huge fee, and got him back on loan this year). New stadium, gorgeous.

**Lorient** : Other club from brittany, they were managed by the same coach, Christian Gourcuff, father of Yoann, for more than 10 seasons, but he decided to quit his job at the end of last season, and left his assistant, Ripoli, in charge this year. They were known for playing a beautiful offensive football, and there's no reason why this year should change. Key players to watch include Aboubakar, Jouffre, Ayew (coming from Marseille), A. Traoré or Ecuelé Manga. Their stadium isn't that great though. They share a rivalry with Guingamp.
 	
**Lyon** : Non existant in the 80s, rising in the 90s, dominating in the 00s (7 consecutive league wins!) and now trying to rise again through youth devlopment in the 10s. It's hard to sum up what the OL was in the 00s, but with players such as Essien, Diarra, Juninho, Tiago, Fred, Lloris/Coupet, Cris, Abidal, Malouda...they were crushing everyone in the league, and were quite feared in the Champions League. This period is over though, as a few expensive and not very succesfull signings as well as building a new stadium privately owned lowered their financial power. One of the best youth academies in France, smart signings this summer (Jallet from PSG, Rose from VA) while getting rid of two high wages players (Briand/Gomis), and a new Coach, Fournier from Reims, former OL player in the 90s. Key players to watch : Fofana, Grenier/Gourcuff (when they're fit) Lacazette (who might leave for a good offer) Gonalons, Umtiti and hopefully Benzia. They share a rivalry with Saint-Etienne, and to a lesser extent, Marseille.

**Marseille**: The only French club who won the Champions League (93). Glorious past, except for some shady affairs (corrupting players/refs, financial montages..). This year will be interesting for them, as they finally got rid of Anigo, who was a very toxic guy in OM's management staff, and got a brand new shiny manager, Bielsa aka El Loco. They have one of the worst youth systems in France, but the coming of Bielsa might change that. Strong team, with key players such as Ayew, Gignac, Batshuayi, Nkoulou, Mandanda, and one of the most promising french players, Thauvin. Their huge stadium just got renovated, and the city really lives for its football club. Share a rivalry with Paris, sometimes called ""le classico/le classique"". 
	
**Metz**: Club from the eastern part of France, got promoted from L2 this year. I'm not entirely sure what to say about them as well, as I didn't quite follow L2 last season. I just know they crushed the league. The eastern part of France used to be a strong Football area (Nancy/Metz/Strasbourg/Sochaux) but this year Metz will be the only one in L1. They always had a decent academy, and stadium as well, and a few respected players played for them in the 90s/00s, including Pires (Arsenal), Ribery (OM/Bayern), Adebayor (Arsenal/City/Tottenham) or even Cissé (Newcastle). I'd keep an eye on Carasso, Falcon, N'Gbakoto, Sakho though.

**Monaco**: A foreign Club in L1! To sum it up in a few words, great past (CL finals in 2004), great managers (Wenger, Deschamps, Tigana, Puel), now russian owner, big names, small stadium and attendance. They have been surprisingly quiet this transfer window (except for selling James Rodriguez to Real for 80m€, Abidal to Olympiakos and Riviere to Newcatsle but got a new portuguese coach, Jardim from Sporting CP, and some youngsters such as Nardi and Bakayoko). They will play the CL this year, and  players such as Falcao, Toulalan, Kondogbia, Berbatov, Moutinho, Traoré (if fit) or Kurzawa might impress you.

 The austerity was counter productive contracting more than gain achieved through exports. Currency unions have internal transfers within the union to compensate weaker regions for the over valued currency, and also to deal with asymmetric shocks (as the don't have macro tools like interest rates, and devaluation). Transfer are made while restructuring takes place. The euro-zone has pretty much ruled out anything other than austerity, and a some of inflation. This is probably not enough. 

As for leaving the EU. EU countries exist outside the euro-zone. Theoretically, and functionally, there shouldn't be a problem. There is purposely no mechanism to leave, so that countries aren't slipping in and out of the currency when it suits them. Being kick out of the EU, would only happen if the EU wanted to be nasty and make an example of the country and scare off others from exiting. If the exitee was a large country Italy, France, Spain, they would be of too much systemic importance to kick out. I can't see any country volunteering to leaving the euro-zone unless it was unstoppable as the political establishment of the countries are very much wedded to the single currency.

I see your point. But often allies do expect more than good intentions. For instance Poland didn't simply ask for greater US presence since Russia increased operations in its neighboring country. The PM's exact words were that he ""expected"" a greater US presence. The US presence in the Baltics and Poland has cost it $1 billion from March to June. 

France and the UK didn't simply hope for the best when it came to securing international involvement in Libya, namely the US'. The Obama administration wanted to sit out intervention there. After the French President and British PM went to Washington, the administration changed its tune and got involved. European physical security and energy security are both in the US' interest as well, but they are very clearly mostly European issues. The shared interests and alliances mean both of these examples are not only expectations, but also quasi-obligations.

Pas besoin de remonter jusqu'à la Bastille pour cela. Par contre d'accord, les prisons aujourd'hui sont pleines à ras bord, je ne peux pas te contredire, et le budget alloué est déjà assez massif.

Pour le reste, je me plains du trop de confort apporté alors que la télé n'est pas essentielle pour une réhabilitation, et pour faire réfléchir ceux qui ont commis un délit grave ou même un crime en tant que mineur. Au contraire, ça a largement tendance à faire l'inverse. L'éducation de notre époque n'est pas parfaite, mais comme pour les conditions de détention, elle reste bien meilleure ; et cette explosion de délinquance est due à un certain laxisme au niveau scolaire alors que l'on est capable de faire bien mieux avec les moyens actuels, après ce n'est que mon avis.

Comment renforcer l'éducation avec les même moyens ? J'ai des idées. En premier lieu, supprimer ces conneries de Fables de la Fontaine au programme de primaire. Les gamins n'en tirent rien, et certaines sont encore plongées dans une morale chrétienne d'il y a 400 ans, désuète et complètement en déphasage avec la société actuelle. À la place, faire découvrir des autres textes ludiques parcourant toute l'histoire de la France, et ce dès la classe CE2 (avant, ce serait une perte de temps et d'argent).

Ensuite, bon là je sens les huées et les pleurs et les cris se fondre contre moi, mais rétablir et légaliser les punitions physiques ""soft"" ne leur ferait pas de mal. Le professeur, qu'il soit de primaire ou de lycée, est un troisième parent, et un bon coup de règle sur les doigts accompagné d'une gueulante devant toute la classe c'est toujours bon à prendre. Il faut montrer qu'il y a de l'autorité quelque part.

What was originally said is that specifically electricity has 23% VAT (still lower than Denmark, but that's a tangent).

But I just looked it up, and [Portugal has three different VAT rates](http://portugal.angloinfo.com/money/general-taxes/value-added-tax/), the other two are 13% and 4%.

So, only companies selling things with the highest VAT rate (which admittedly is more than just power) may find this to be a problem. In terms of electricity, I suspect the original argument was ""all companies use electricity, and so all companies will be affected by high VAT on power"", but in fact if companies get all the VAT *they've* paid refunded, only companies that *sell* electricity (and other high-VAT goods or services) will be inconvenienced.

1) [Arqiva Emley Moor Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emley_Moor_transmitting_station) - as a kid, this landmark heralded in the final leg of the journey from holidays in Cornwall. At 330.4m (1,084ft) in height, it is the tallest free-standing structure in the UK. My Uncles's company used to insure it.

2) [Sutton Bank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Bank) - This hill marks the transition from the Vale of York to the plateau that is the North York Moors. It is very steep, and a pain in the arse to drive up (let alone walk/cycle!). The pay-off is the [view from the top](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/20/Photograph_of_Sutton_Bank_at_dusk.jpg), you can see for miles.

3) [Malham Cove](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malham_Cove) - A place I have been to many times, and still love. A sheer limestone cliff face, that was a waterfall in the last ice age. Very impressive, and the top has large areas of [limestone pavements](http://www.warringtonramblers.talktalk.net/mal7.jpg) to explore.

4) [Humber Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humber_bridge) - Opened in 1981, this impressive bridge spans the [Humber Estuary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humber) and comes in at 2,220m (7,280ft) in length. Well worth the toll fare across.

5) [Pontefract Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontefract_Castle) - Often overlooked by tourists with York being close by, but worth a visit. It was slighted after the last English Civil War in the 17th Century but the ruins are still impressive. You can explore the cellars, which are daubed with graffiti from soldiers taking part in the last siege. Formerly a Royal Palace (along with nearby [Sandal Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandal_Castle)), and is likely the location where Richard II was murdered - which is alluded to in Shakespeare's play Richard III.

6) [York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York) - Well, what can I say? There is something for (nearly?) everyone in York. From winding streets filled with shops, the Minster, the Castle Museum, York Dungeon, National Railway Museum, City walls... if you haven't been, please do. Try getting off the beaten track and exploring the snickleways and less-loved parts of town.

Pas besoin de remonter jusqu'à la Bastille pour cela. Par contre d'accord, les prisons aujourd'hui sont pleines à ras bord, je ne peux pas te contredire, et le budget alloué est déjà assez massif.

""Plusieurs générations"" ça fait quoi ? 50 ans ? 75 ans ? Oui évidemment par rapport à une époque où la peine de mort existait encore, c'est un grand progrès mais on s'en fout. Ce qui compte c'est maintenant et l'évolution dans un laps de temps de l'ordre de la décennie, on peut justifier n'importe quel immobilisme en regardant suffisamment loin en arrière.

&gt;Pour le reste, je me plains du trop de confort apporté alors que la télé n'est pas essentielle pour une réhabilitation, et pour faire réfléchir ceux qui ont commis un délit grave ou même un crime en tant que mineur. Au contraire, ça a largement tendance à faire l'inverse. L'éducation de notre époque n'est pas parfaite, mais comme pour les conditions de détention, elle reste bien meilleure ; et cette explosion de délinquance est due à un certain laxisme au niveau scolaire alors que l'on est capable de faire bien mieux avec les moyens actuels, après ce n'est que mon avis. (Donner des exemples particuliers ne suffirait pas à démontrer cette généralité, mais si tu en veux quand même, [j'en ai un pour commencer~](http://www.agoravox.fr/tribune-libre/article/l-instituteur-avait-dit-je-coupe-49893))

Comment peut-tu être d'avis que les prisons sont pleines, puis attaquer leur trop-plein de confort ? ""Plein"" ce n'est pas un détenu par place, c'est jusqu'à deux détenus là où on pourrait n'en accueillir qu'un. C'est loin d'être confortable.

C'est tellement peu confortable que la France s'est faite condamner par la CEDH à cause des traitements inhumains et dégradants infligés à un détenu : http://www.oip.org/index.php/component/k2/item/1071-la-france-épinglée-par-la-cour-européenne-des-droits-de-lhomme-pour-sa-surpopulation-carcérale On est loin de la télé HD là...

""Faire réfléchir les détenus"" ? À quoi est-ce que tu veux qu'ils réfléchissent ? Thème et variations sur ""voler c'est mal"" ? On les réintègre en les faisant travailler et en leur donnant un but, pas en leur faisant signifier qu'ils sont des sous-merdes.

&gt;Ensuite, bon là je sens les huées et les pleurs et les cris se fondre contre moi, mais rétablir et légaliser les punitions physiques ""soft"" ne leur ferait pas de mal. Le professeur, qu'il soit de primaire ou de lycée, est un troisième parent, et un bon coup de règle sur les doigts accompagné d'une gueulante devant toute la classe c'est toujours bon à prendre. Il faut montrer qu'il y a de l'autorité quelque part.

Je crois que la psychologie a avancé depuis. Je sais pas, faut que je me renseigne.

&gt;Enfin, ne pas faire passer en prépa' ceux qui n'en ont pas la capacité, ça c'est juste pour retarder la grimpette de la courbe du chômage car le gouvernement sait d'avance combien vont redoubler dès leur première année.

Je ne sais pas si c'est comme ça dans toutes les prépas, mais en tout cas pour les prépas scientifiques on ne peut pas redoubler la première année.

true,miramarco,lurker,,"Pay attention: ""[Lo] ho sempre chiamato Luglio"" works because the adverb ""sempre"" suggests a continued action. If you remove it, ""[Lo] ho chiamato Luglio"" suggests a one-time action: there was a moment in the recent past when you called him ""Luglio"", and that's over.

The core concept of the two phrases you wrote is the same. I feel like there is a slight difference though: ""lo ho sempre chiamato"" makes me think of the several instances of an action, while ""lo chiamavo"" gives me the generalized idea of having called someone in the past, with less emphasis on the singular instances of the action. But it's a very subtle undertone and I wouldn't usually notice it.

I would advise not to think to the two tenses as mutually interchangeable, but there are many instances where both tenses would work, as long as there is a suitable modifier along with the verb. As usual in the Italian language, there's no one-size-fits-all solution.

A couple of asides: unless you want to stress the direct object (""I called *him* July, not other people""), I would replace ""lui"" with ""lo"", which should be said before the verb. The sentence sounds less cumbersome that way. Also, ""chiamavo lui sempre luglio"" is a weird sentence: ""sempre"" modifies the verb, so it should be put next to ""chiamavo"", as in ""lo chiamavo sempre luglio"" (or ""chiamavo sempre *lui* luglio"", for more emphasis on the direct object).",0,1407829714,null,0,false,0,cjnwam3,t3_2db7or,t1_cjnwam3,t3_2db7or,null,1435195524,12,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,12

For example, if you sell 100 euros of services per year, 20 euros (lets make it 20% vat to make it easy) is vat. You have to 'send' this money to the government.

Now, if you bought a 1000 euros computer, you paid 200 euros of vat. Every 3 months you send the VAT papers, and in this case, you would get 20 euros refunded (200 you paid - 20 euros your customer paid) but still be left with 180 euros of vat paid that you won't get back.

Edit: altra cosa da considerare: l'aria dell'AC è secchissima, dato che la maggior parte dell'acqua condensa nella macchina.

What I find really hilarious about the fact the UK was happy to sail Ukraine down the river over russian money in the London housing market, France was happy to sail Ukraine down the river over a warship and Germany was happy to sail Ukraine over the growth of it's economy is that the US has spent the better half of 60 years trying to export it's economic doctrine of neo-liberal, Laissez-faire capitalism. Believing that once all countries were neatly lined up conforming to the US's very specific capitalism they'd forever be strongly allied.

IE. removing government control over private business so big (US owned) multi-national conglomerates can come into your country and rape it's natural resources or worker production for pennies on the pound and countries that don't conform - like Venezuela, Cuba, Chile, Peru, Uruquay, Bolivia, Ecuador, Vietnam - that allowed government intrusion and nationalisation of land or fair wages for their workers were brutally fucked over or sanctioned into the third world but it's ok because they were ""communist"" or ""would be communist"" and [""domino-theorys""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory) or ""something"" etc etc... 

Anyway - my point is that Russia - since it's major economic shift to capitalism after the fall of the soviet union appears to be able to play the same tune - ie. weaponise their business against European countries to the point that european countries are doing their damndest to be ""doing somthing against Russia"" whilst not actually doing anything. A farcical carnival of the US trying to show strength against Russia whilst European countries wag their fingers and do backroom deals with Russian businessmen and oligarchs.

true,Forgot_password_shit,ESTO,Estonia,"&gt;Latvia and Estonia have significant amount of Russian population that is being discriminated against. And we will have to do something about it.

I can't speak for Latvia, but the discrimination in Estonia is minimal. The only discrimination issue I have is that a lot of Russian-speaking populous that is born here can't get citizenship unless they pass an Estonian language exam. If almost a quarter of the populous speaks Russian as their first language, then Estonian shouldn't be a requirement in my opinion. But then again, I'm no politician and don't really know the reasons behind this weird law. I think that a history/society test is much more important (how much they value democracy, know the laws and the actual history).

The talk about them not being able to get employed due to not speaking Estonian... well if your workplace is 99% Estonian, you should know Estonian, otherwise you will not be able to do your tasks. Also, in many cases the job requires (for example, cashiers) the employee to know both Estonian and Russian to some extent (also Finnish/English, depending on the chain and location). Absolutely no discrimination there.

The talk about Estonia eliminating Russian schools is also misinformed. The government upped classes that are taught in Estonian for Russian schools. The majority of classes are still taught in Russian. And you can still pass your exams in Russian. Which is a lot better than the situation in Russia, where all exams have to be passed in Russian, even in the federal republics where the native tongue is not Russian.

The whole Bronze Night fiasco has sparked a victim-mentality in a certain group of Esto-Russians. The reality is that we will not tolerate the wrongful interpretation of history (Soviet/Russian version) as it is harmful to the sovereignty and integrity of Estonia. We do however respect the people's right to honor whoever they want and that's why the monument and the deceased were relocated to the military cemetery, which is a much more respectful place for it anyway. There's no reason why a memorial of our annexators should don the center of our capital.

My daily commute is 4km by bike. Don't need public transport. Other than my commute, I do use the train a lot. It's fast and comfortable. The one I use is on time most of the time. I hear that on busier stretches trains are late more often.

&gt; How timely/efficient/costly is it?

I have a subscription to the railway company that comes with a huge reduction, so it's really quite cheap. The route I usually take is a 2 hour train trip to see my mother. Recently, 10 minutes was shaved off that time when a new stretch of rail tracks opened.

&gt; Is it electric or ""polluting""?

Nearly all trains in the Netherlands are electric, except for some remote rural lines up North that use DMUs.

&gt; Can you use your bike in combination with public transit?

You can use a bike to get to or from the train station. Parking is ample. A lot of people will own a ""station bike"" on the other side of the train trip, for the last part of the journey. You can also use OV-fiets for that bit.

Taking your bike with you on the train is possible, but costs extra. A folding bike on the other hand counts as regular luggage and is free.

I can and I do. I hardly ever miss it.

true,austm,LITH,Lithuania,"I think talking about public transport in the entire Europe is impossible because there are big differences.
So I will tell it from my point of view and I live in a very small European state.
&gt;What's your daily commute, what forms of public/private transit do you use, and what about journeys other than your daily commute, basically, how do you travel around?

I currently use city bus or trolleybus. I used to use commuter train to travel to the capital 100 kilometers and back to my city every day before as well.
So as for public transport, in two biggest cities of Lithuania, it takes from 20 minutes to 1 hour to get somewhere. The capital has fast buses for the most crowded directions, in my city Kaunas there's no such need. You can travel with public transport from almost any part of a city, except for very new suburbs, maybe, so it's quite possible to travel using it all the time.
As for the train, it used to take me three hours every day to travel from Kaunas to Vilnius and three more hours to travel back. We have the fast train what goes around 100 kilometers/hour and more, so the journey itself take one hour. However, you have to come to the train station, also, the timetable is not very convenient and makes daily commuting between cities a pain in the ass.

&gt;How timely/efficient/costly is it? Is it electric or ""polluting""?

A monthly ticket for public transport costs about 30 euros. Estonia's capital Tallinn has it for free for the residents of the city.
Trolleybuses are all electric, some of the busses are hybrid, so the pollution is rather little.

It's really cheaper than using your own car. However, most of people still choose cars because of the convenience and because it's a faster way to get somewhere.

&gt;Can you use your bike in combination with public transit? Can you live Car-free? Are your governments supportive of such initiatives (funding wise etc)?

There's a rented bikes network in Vilnius, allowing you to travel on your bike in the city center. Also, as cities aren't big, it's very much possible to live without a car and travel everywhere on your bike. It takes from 40 minutes to hour to get anywhere. And if you live closer to the city center, even less.

So the situation is more or less okay. However, Vilnius suffer from traffic jams and crowded public transport. As the city is growing very fast and has many debts, it has problems keeping the public transport up to date.",0,1407833260,null,0,1407833649,0,cjnx0e7,t3_2dbhie,t1_cjnx0e7,t3_2dbhie,null,1435195863,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

There's probably not a place in Paris which isn't maximum 10 minutes walking distance from a metro station. Strikes or whatnot are much rarer than the stereotype, though there may be occasionally some delays on a given metro line a few times a year because of a technical problem (or a suicide...).

The city and region (including the suburbs) is currently investing a lot to improve the metro and train system, building many more lines and stations, in Paris and through the suburbs. Currently in the suburbs there are many train lines which go to Paris, but unless you live next to a train station, you'll probably need a car to get to the train station because the public rail system doesn't cover all the suburbs as well as it does Paris. Public buses cover enough of suburbs however, so they're the preferred method of public transport for now.

Paris has installed lots of [city bicycles for rent](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/V%C3%A9lib%27.jpg). But the city isn't bike-friendly. There are rarely bicycle paths on roads.

To travel around in France, I usually take the high speed trains, and the regional trains. It's very effective and quick. France is small enough for trains to be a faster means of transport than planes, considering the time to reach an airport (which are typically in the distant suburbs of cities), and having to be there an hour or two earlier, whereas long distance train stations are in the center of cities and one doesn't need to be there early or check out baggages and whatnot.

I think the government is very supportive of public transportation, and invests a lot in it. And it's a good thing. My biggest complaint is that the metro system in Paris closes too early (at around 1AM). I wish at least the main axes would stay open all night.",0,1407833711,null,0,false,0,cjnx3ey,t3_2dbhie,t1_cjnx3ey,t3_2dbhie,null,1435195902,33,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,33

Business is worried over Russian counter-sanctions. Dairy product, meat, fruit &amp; vegetable, as well as transport, export companies will be hit hard. It is said dairy will be hit the worst. The Lithuanian govt. is considering compensating business with funds borrowed from the EC and helping find new export destinations. (In particular, I have heard the Middle East mentioned, for example Lebanon.) The government estimates losses of around 0,2 % of total GDP, but the IMF estimates are 10 more severe--2 % of GDP. Lithuania trades the most with Russia within the EU, as a % of total trade.

It's partly subsided by the municipality, and it's really cheap — 20 minutes for free, 1 hour 1 zł (~0.25 EUR), 2 hours 4 zł (~1 EUR), 3 hours 7 zł (~1,75 EUR) and so on, and with [dens network of station](http://en.veturilo.waw.pl/locations/) it's really great — you can get to many places within free 20 minutes (I usually manage to do that) or 1 hour. In my experince you have to try really hard (or go to a place where are no stations) to rent a bike for more than one hour. I only wish we had more bike lanes and parkings, but we're getting there slowly.

You can use your bike with public transport as long as there is a space to do that (so except rush hour you're quite good). You don't have to pay an extra ~~share~~ fare (at least in buses, trams and metro, not 100% sure about trains).

The bus/trams network is, I'd say, quite good. Though of course it could be better in suburbs. So far we have only one metro line, but first segment of the second should be open within a month or two.

[Ticket prices](http://www.ztm.waw.pl/index.php?c=110&amp;l=2) are i believe relatively low compared with other countries, however if you take our earnings into an account they're quite costly.

true,a_guy_from_CEE,HUNG,Hungary,"Depends in whether you live in a big city, or commute from two villages away (our version of suburbs), or live in a small town altogether.

But generally:

1) I have formerly lived in Hungary and the UK (Brummieland) and drove my car as it was more comfortable. Now I live  in Vienna, Austria the public transport is really more effective. It is not a poverty issue for me. However, I am probably a bit lucky with two tramways in front of our house, there are places where basically you just get a bus and I would rather drive. And Vienna is generally speaking an unusually good city, with all the quality of life awards it gets. It's not the same everywhere. In capitols maybe yes. 

But take Rouen, France. OK it is just 500K people, not a huge city, but basically there is one metro line and the rest is bus. So either you live in the city center, or if you commute from the outskirts or a village away you are really better off driving, unless you happen to like buses (I don't).

&gt;and what about journeys other than your daily commute, basically, how do you travel around? 

Well I basically don't. The McFit gym is next to the job, the grocery store is next to our home, where else to go? There are also bars but we just drink at home. I think you will find that perhaps people over here are bit more ""shut in"" at least over 30 with kids.

&gt;Are you a ""willing"" commuter?

To be honest, I liked it when I was driving a car - it was a status symbol, it is a way to pimp around the fact that I have a good job, and I dislike being close to other people on the tramway. But it is expensive (that is why it is a status symbol) and ineffective, so I stopped. But I liked it.

&gt;What are the common complaints?

I don't know what complaints others have, for me it is the other people. There is no such thing as a nice middle classy tramway or subway. If there was a first class ticket I would fucking buy it. Rubbing elbows with the guy who did not bathe for a week, with the mentally ill guy with saliva drooping from his mouth, with the sneezing guy who could gave me flu or for all I know ebola, is seriously a nopen-nope-nope experience, I don't like it at all. I liked it that in my car there was nobody but me. **I definitely was ill less often - it seems you get more flu when you travel public transport than when you drive.**

**And not every subway, and none of tramway lines I use have A/C. Seriously fuck everything about it, and that in Vienna, Austria, the city with the highest quality of living on the whole planet!** I hate it when I get sweaty on my way to work and then get to sit in that all day. Of course back home in Budapest it is much, much worse.

Car = assured A/C.  Bike = at least you get wind. Tramway = sauna.

&gt;Can you use your bike in combination with public transit?

A lot of people seem to, but fuck me if I understand it. Is there a shower in their office? Do they put their office clothes in their backpack? Just how is it more effective and especially: how is it safer (clue: iti is not) than hopping on the tramway? 

I am entirely perplexed by bike riders. It is a **sport**, and treating a sport as a commute is IMHO not a good combination - I want to be able to take a shower after doing sport, I want to be able to change clothes after doing sport, and fuck everything about doing my sport between angry, impatient car drivers! It is so unsafe.

Bike commuters in this thread, how do you see it? Is it not a sport for you?

&gt;Are your governments supportive of such initiatives (funding wise etc)?

Of course, it is a good way to get PR points, not necessarily because everybody likes it, but it seems everybody likes to _pretend_ to like it: environmentalism is simply fashionable and makes one look intelligent and cool.

&gt;Do people vote for these initiatives, accept these as a prefer investment of their Tax money?

LEL OK. Here is the deal. There are huge differences, but on the whole, Europe has less of a democratic spirit than America. More aristocratic heritage in the minds. What I mean by that that people are more likely to not be engaged in politics, not have strong opinions, and accept more or less passively what political elites do than in the US. In America it seems everybody has such a fierce opinion in favor of or against, say, partial birth abortion, that it sounds like they really think it is the people's job to decide it. Here people have opinions, but not too outspoken because they think they are kind of powerless and the political elites will decide it anyway.

Being part of the international community is the reason to live there. Don't go off of the building because it can be a little 'ehhhh' at times (everyone complained, including myself, but we were just bitching Americans. It really wasn't bad and the rooms were a lot bigger than I was expecting). The campus is a microcosm of the world within Paris and I made so many amazing friends from Norway, Belgium, Germany, England, etc just by walking out the front door (trust me you won't regret it). I kept a blog while living there and took a lot of pictures, here's a link showing what my room looked like: 

https://kellydoesparis.wordpress.com/2013/03/28/a-day-in-the-life-22032013/

This is from my site. My take on the bathrooms -

'The showers in my building have helped me to understand why the French appear to only bathe once a week. There are 250 students living in my residence hall and I am only aware of 2 showers that have hot water. To have been let in on the existence of those 2 hot showers, is to be inducted into the Fondation des Etats-Unis (Foundation of the United States Building) secret society. The availability of these coveted Fountains of the Gods have been reverently guarded for countless semester-generations. Granted the water only lasts for 19 ‘Mississippis’ (because 20 would be too many) before you have to violently pump the lever to continue the flow of water. Another fun quirk the showers’ provide – the lights only remain on for 39 ‘Mississippis’ so after every other lever pump you need to step outside of the shower and do a quasi-YMCA dance to remind the room there is activity that requires light.'

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Of course it depends on the country, but also how rural your start and destination is. At least in Germany, the basic structure is that you have inter-city train connections between cities, from there you can change to regional trains that stop in small towns or even villages along the track. So, railways form something like the backbone.  
Large cities may have subways and urban rail, typically at least trams that can sometimes reach quite far if they are compatible with railway tracks. Buses connect the periphery and villages that are off the tracks. Frequency of the schedule degrades the further you get away from population centers, but it would have to be a *very* rural village not to be covered at all. As a rule of thumb, you can get from any pub or church to any other pub or church by public transport and a short walk *somehow*, with few exceptions (e.g., those catering to hikers).

How convenient this is depends on where you are and where you want to go. Getting to and from city centers works well enough for the overwhelming majority of the population to be able to make do if they want or have to, but if you need to go from one location that is literally off the tracks to another, it often isn't anything as how crows would fly. The fewer people would want such a connection, the less likely the schedules are to match up, and the more likely you are to have to go via the city center even if it it essentially doubles the distance. But if you live in or near a city, I'd say that for most people a car is more about convenience than about true necessity.",0,1407836847,null,0,1407837078,0,cjnxo1q,t3_2dbhie,t1_cjnxo1q,t3_2dbhie,null,1435196177,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

An average Dutch cyclist (and this average includes children and the elderly) can do a 5km journey in about 20 minutes. The idea is not to get there fast, but to get there efficiently and comfortably. Cycling is not seen as a mode of ""road transport"", but more like an ""upgrade"" to your feet.

Result - fall of Soukhumi, Abkhazia is a Somali-like lawless region today.

Also Russian ""peacekeepers"" like to allow artillery to shoot from their positions to provoke reciprocal fire and then blame locals for starting war - with ""peacekeeping"" invasion to follow. Georgia is a good example of Russian ""humanitarian"" operations. For me it will be a miracle if there are still people who can fall for ""Russian humanitarian convoy"" trick.

true,thatfool,EURO,European Union,"I live in Germany, in what I'd say is a medium sized city (a few 100k) and I don't have a car.

I don't have to commute since I can work from home, but I used to use the tram for my old job. For grocery shopping I usually walk, or I take the tram to go to the inner city. I used to use my bike a lot too but I really need to get a new one if I want to do that again. It's not high priority for me, since tram and bus trips are already paid for anyway (yearly ticket). If I had to go to the office, I'd definitely use a bike since it's faster to just ride the bike in a straight line. but tram and bus are viable too.

My wife uses a bike (and the train if she has to go to my state's capital, paid by her employer). Sometimes she uses the bus (bus stop right behind the house and right next to her work).

My wife's bike is a folding bike, but generally trams have some space for bikes and trains often have a car or two reserved for bikes. My city also tries to support bicycles in other ways, but a lot of it isn't that well thought out. I guess they try...

We use car sharing when we need a car. By ""need"", I mostly mean day trips that are more convenient if you have a car (e.g. if you want to do some shopping too). There are several car sharing cars available within a few minutes of walking, so this is a much better deal for us than a car of our own. Car sharing is also supported by the city and we get a discount from our yearly tickets for tram and bus. Cars can be booked online, and some can be used ad hoc too (touch your card to the window, get in, drive), so it's as convenient as it can be.

Trams use electricity from renewable sources. I guess buses aren't as clean since we don't have electric ones. Many trains in Germany also run on electricity from renewable sources, but not all are electric. When we use car sharing, we try to rent hybrids. They have fully electric cars too but we don't really need those, since we don't need a car for anything in their range. We also usually don't need large or fast cars, so fuel efficient hybrids are the best choice for us. Anyway I'd say that overall, we have some very clean options.

Common complaints about any form of public transport are that they're late and expensive. But of course, by ""late"" we mean ""two minutes"" and while ""expensive"" could always be debated, it's already heavily subsidized, so there is little we can realistically expect. Personally, I don't think it's too expensive.

When it comes to improvements, I think the network itself is fine so the biggest potential improvement is hiring more polite bus drivers :P

I don't know if people would vote for all these subsidies, since they don't let us vote on them. Personally, I support them. There are many good reasons to make efficient and affordable transportation available to everybody.

There are no financial reasons for us to not have our own car. It's just not efficient right now, and in addition to the usual stuff we'd have to rent a parking space too. I would say that we could live 100% car free, but car sharing is just *too* convenient sometimes (about once per month, according to my account history).

I used to live in a smaller town (~20k people). It had a pretty good bus network and it's connected to larger cities by train. I walked everywhere anyway but I guess the network wasn't bad. The only weakness was some shopping area slightly outside, but it wasn't essential to go there (lots of small stores everywhere at the time).

My inlaws live in a small village. I've seen bus stops there but never a bus. It's tiny anyway though, and it's efficiently connected to larger cities by train.

When I have to (or want to) go to one of the other larger cities and car sharing isn't useful, I always use local transport. Long distance train tickets usually include the last leg to your destination via local public transport, but I often buy day tickets because I can do most things that way.",0,1407837443,null,0,false,0,cjnxrz1,t3_2dbhie,t1_cjnxrz1,t3_2dbhie,null,1435196224,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,CreepyOctopus,LATV,Latvia | Sweden,"For Latvia:

No problem there. Always took the public transport in Riga, worked just fine since early school years and until I got my bachelor's degree. Just about every place in the city is within a short walk of a tram/trolleybus/bus stop, and there are good connections. Also things improved since we got rid of conductors on the transport and installed an electronic ticket system. The downside of transport in Riga is that there are still too many old vehicles, in particular trams are still mostly the old Czechoslovak ones and we only have a few of the newer ones, but that is being upgraded.

For travel between cities, trains (electric) work fine, along with a bus network that has stops pretty much everywhere. Any small village and even just roads along the woods where you don't immediately see where people live. The trains could also use an upgrade, as they're old and not faster than cars, but the timetables are good and there are no problems getting around by rail.

Biking is not very advanced. Few bike lanes, not much biking culture.

For Sweden:

I'm in a city with ~100k people, it feels like the majority of locals rely on buses and bikes. Again, every place in the city is close to a bus stop, although from some destinations to others you'd need to take a detour to get a connection. Even though the city is somewhat spread out, one can easily get around by bike anywhere. Separate bike lanes are everywhere, abundant bike parking and a culture that encourages biking. Personally, I prefer walking, and take the bus when it's a bigger distance or I just want to get there faster. Buses in the city run on biofuel.

To go to other cities, I normally take the train. There are high-speed trains and regional trains, but the regional trains are still faster than one would travel by car. If I need to get to Stockholm, I just hop on a train. With free Internet onboard, the trains are very comfortable, the high-speed trains also have acceptable food that I make use of when on business travel. Only downside is that the high-speed trains are quite expensive unless booked in advance.

Buses are also an option for travel between cities, they are comfortable and cheaper, though I prefer trains due to the speed.

My only complaint would be that often the last train leaves too early. For instance, the last direct train from Gothenburg to Stockholm (these are the two largest cities!) leaves at something like 20:30.

Overall, I'm very happy to use public transport, do not own a car and have no desire to buy one in the immediate future. It would not save me any time traveling between cities, and for my everyday needs it would save me small amounts of time in exchange for all the extra expenses, hassle with parking and so on.

Now come the fuck on. Putin is pretty bad, but stop pretending he is the next Mussolini. The Russian setup is still a kind of a democracy - an authoritarian, managed democracy to be sure, not quite _our_ kind of democracy, more of a Singapore kind democracy, but a democracy. And with dangerous imperialistic tendencies (see democratic 19th century Western Europe for parallels), this is the part that matters for us. But ""destroying democracy"" is taking it way, way too far.

Unrealistic demonization will only only antagonize them.

Protip: when a leader is popular, calling his system anti-democratic (given that popular government is the essence of democracy) basically sends the message to his supporters that their opinion does not matter and foreigners know it better how they should govern their country. This sure as hell pisses them off. So: Putin is not trying to destroy democracy. He is trying to restore the Russian Empire. It is not the same thing.

No, I got an iphone and I knew I would be paying it off. But that's partly why I called them with my german friend, because I asked how much I had to pay off on the phone and the two people we talked to already told us that I'd paid it off.. I'd assumed I would have charges for that. 

It also isn't making sense now I think about the math, because 530€ divided by how many months I had left on the contract doesn't equal the 49,95€ I was paying per month anyway..

Hier, faisant fi du ciel menaçant, j'ai pris un Vélib.  
Deux roues, deux pédales, des freins et des lampes qui fonctionnent, pas
de bruit bizarre. Je prends.  

500 mètres plus tard, ma pédale gauche me fait des trucs étranges. Bon.
Pas grave.

Quatre bornes plus tard, à mi-chemin, dans la cuvette juste avant porte de la
chapelle, ma pédale gauche tombe. Bordel de merde, fallait que ça arrive
avant une montée en plus.  
Pas grave, il y a une énorme station Vélib à porte d'Aubervilliers, je
peux poser là-bas et prendre le tram.

Et ben non. Station fermée. Celle d'à côté aussi.  

Bon, pas grave, je vais aller rue de Crimée, je sais que la station est
ouverte pis j'ai de la descente avant. Oh, une goutte. Merde, elle a
invité ses copines. Putaiiiin.

Crimée, il pleut plus, il drache. J'attends 8 minutes le bus dans une
sorte de mini-temple d'un temps ancien avec marqué ""Cab.e T.lépho.iq.""
dessus. C'est rigolo, sur l'arbre en face il y a zeub mal dessiné.

Je monte dans le bus, après une bousculade avec une grosse qui mériterait
une claque et le retrait de son permis poids-lourd, je m'assois.

Juste derrière moi, un chiard se met à crier. Bordel. Ça pouvait pas
être pire. Je mets mes écouteurs en urgence pour bloquer le bruit.

Il pleut toujours dehors. Le bus oublie de s'arrêter à un arrêt et
refuse de s'arrêter après. Les gens dans le bus commencent à gueuler, un
abruti se met à insulter le chauffeur en anglais et en espagnol avec un
accent à la Super Dupont. J'en ai marre de la vie.

&gt;As Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, Parubiy oversaw the ""anti–terrorist"" operation against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Parubiy)

Er hat den Verlauf also überwacht und dann beratende Tätigkeiten wahrgenommen.

Dasselbe machen -zumindest as die Arbeit im RNBO betrifft- auch alle anderen o.g. Personen, da alle o.g. Ämter gleichgestellt sind und einem Zusammentreffen der departments und dem Präsidenten, sowie Premier dient.

Er ist eben nur der Sekretär und darf dem Präsidenten ein wenig paperwork abnehmen, bzw weiterleiten und ordnen. Er ist zwar irgendwie involviert, hat aber eher administrative Aufgaben, er hat aber nicht das kleinste bisschen exekutive Gewalt. Entscheidungsprozesse werden in dem RNBO ohnehin nicht getroffen.*

I can get home to my parents on the train in about 3.5 hours and anywhere else in the country is easily reachable by train (or sometimes coach).

Buses in the UK (except in London) are not regulated, anyone can set a route wherever they want and charge what they like, consequently buses in Leeds are more expensive than continental cities (even London) so I don't tend to use them, its cheaper to share a taxi with three/four people if you're going out so I tend to do that.

Leeds has a big pollution problem the volume of buses in the centre can make it quite an unpleasant place to be, for that reason the local transport authority want to put in a few trolleybus lines but the bus company is worried it will break its monopoly so are fiercely campaigning against it.

Every once or two weeks a french bashing article get published in a major British or American newspaper (it's an anglo-saxon thing, I guess more American but the British press are also  followers). Very often they are filled with lies or incorrect facts that are rarely corrected after being debunked. France seems to attract a lot of fantasies born  in the mind of people with agendas, using our country as a scarecrow to validate their own policies and to praise the British way of doing things.

No,dear [the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2014/apr/09/french-6pm-labour-agreement-work-emails-out-of-office), it's not true that we are forced to turn off our business phones and ignore our business e-mails after 6pm. Contrary to the stereotype we work more than Germans! What is it [Newsweek?](http://www.newsweek.com/fall-france-225368?piano_t=1) No we have not gone bankrupt yet, our milk isn't 6 euros per liter and our rich people aren't paying 75% of their income in taxes.  Hey [Times Magazine](http://pmcdn.priceminister.com/photo/time-2007-n-22-the-death-of-french-culture-917763694_ML.jpg), thank you for the third cover story regarding the death our culture, but too soon! it still hasn't happened yet, try again in 6 months; oh and please, [The Economist](http://www.francetvinfo.fr/image/74rige9y9-c2cf/578/755/1034177.jpg), it's the [fourth time this decade](http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/sites/news/files/assets/image/2012/11/denial2.png) you predict the fall of France, maybe your predictions suck and we're actually doing ok in our own way? 

You can accuse French newspapers to be too self-centered or too much caught in the Franco-german dynamic that they ignore the rest but certainly not to be attacking the UK on a regular basis. I don't see le Monde writting full cover stories regarding ""the fall of the UK"", or making fun of the british lifestyle.
[I love both cultures and countries](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/609/815/941.png) but this kinda annoys me that I always have to defend / correct misconceptions regarding France.

Maybe when the UK feels patriotic or needs to attack the EU or Europe they target France because it's an easy prey that encapsulate a lot of European issues, plus it does not upset the Germans. And maybe it's because the UK and France share similar symptoms of the same *""once was  a great nation that now needs to step back from the world scene""* disease. Also British newspapers, even the serious ones, have a style that can be quite invective sometime compared to other countries.

Bretagne, as you say, looks like Ireland (I would say more Cornwall) whilst Corsica looks like Liguria. As a strict secessionist, I can't accept Corsica as France, anymore than I could accept Corfu as part of Italy, but that's another point. Much of the vast centre of France looks similar though, but the edges have massive diversity. 

However, Italy has mountains (we share Monte Bianco), we have the Dolomites and the Apennines which are spectacular ranges. We have active huge volcanoes, our islands are only surpassed by Greece in Europe. We have huge plains and lakes in the north and coastlines like Amalfi which better the Côte d'Azur. However, despite this, France is over double the size of Italy. 

Culturally, nothing you mentioned for France is missing in Italy, apart from your prehistoric cave paintings. Sud Tyrol is German, Turin is industrial and practically French to boot (slightly similar to Lyon), Sardinia is Corsica but five times bigger, the Val D'Aosta is a montagnard culture and is extremely French (it's like being in Chamonix), Milan is almost as cosmopolitan as Paris while Rome is definitively more beautiful and storied. Come to my home of Naples and it's a chaotic mix of Spain, France, Greece and Rome while Sicily is the largest and most beautiful island in the Mediterranean. The entire peninsula is littered with castles and more churches than anywhere else in the world. Not to mention Pompeii, Venice, Florence and the Slavic north east and the Albanian/Griko regions of Puglia. 

Long story short, having spent the majority of my life in either Italy or France, for me Italy is more impressive and diverse culturally while France edges Italy for natural diversity.

&gt;__Alpha-gal allergies__ are a reaction to [Galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose), whereby the body is overloaded with immunoglobulin E antibodies on contact with the carbohydrate. Alpha-gal is found in all mammals apart from [primates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate) (including humans). Bites from the [lone star tick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyomma_americanum), which transfer this carbohydrate to the victim, have been implicated in the development of this delayed allergic response which is triggered by the consumption of mammalian meat products.  Despite myths to the contrary, an alpha-gal allergy does not require the afflicted to become a vegetarian, as poultry and fish do not trigger a reaction.

true,doomblackdeath,null,null,"Let me ask you something. When you hear the word ""American"", is your first instinct a positive or negative one? For most Europeans, it's a negative one. Whether or not they show it, this is anti-Americanism. You need to understand the difference between anti-Americanism and simply being annoyed with American tourists and/or American military presence. Unlike most other western Euro nations, Italians don't dislike Americans because they're Americans, they dislike the American military presence in Italy because there's no more use for it. Anti-Americanism isn't necessarily overt; in fact, in Europe it's usually very subtle. Whether or not this offends your sensibilities is completely beside the point because it's true. You may not like it and you may even disagree, but many Europeans are by and large hypocrites when it comes to talking about racism and bigotry because they're afraid of being called one. I'm not even saying that they shouldn't be anti-American because that's their choice. I'm simply saying that they should own up to their anti-Americanism and stop pretending it's ok to be a bigot as long as it's against Americans. 

Another thing, if you read carefully, you'll see I said that it's not necessarily Joe Schmoe on the street, but that it goes all the way up to national media. European media is notoriously anti-American and its media is Fox News, only mirrored.

Does this mean YOU are anti-American? Of course not. But to deny that northern Europe leans towards anti-Americanism is quite frankly delusional. Also, I'm not going to speak for Italians, even though I could. Why don't you ask them yourself if they have ever felt slighted or treated poorly by other Europeans because they're Italian, and how often? I think all the support and praise I've gotten from Italians in this topic speaks for itself.

One last thing: you CANNOT say ""we don't hate you, we just hate your government"". This is the biggest chickenshit cop-out ever, and it's simply a way for them to fool themselves into feeling justified for being anti-American. You cannot make this statement because the American people ARE the American government. Bush was elected because Americans went through a stupid, idiotic period after the Clinton administration and the American people deserved the government they got. The American government is elected by the people and is run for the people (in theory), unlike European parliaments and monarchies. There is no separation between the people and the government like there is in Europe, so when people say, ""we don't hate you, just your government"", that's like saying, ""we don't hate you, we just hate everything you stand for"". 

But you know what? That's ok. It's their right to be anti-American and I'm not trying to change that. Do you know what else? I'm not even saying we don't deserve some of it. I'm simply calling them out on their hypocrisy of pretending to be so tolerant and forward-thinking when in reality they're just cherry picking who gets the hate.

The Metro/Bus system is very effective and is generally very effective when moving within the city. If you are going between various suburbs, it can sometimes be a pain if you don't want to go into the the central city.

My daily commute is usually on a commuter train that is bigger and less frequent than the metro. It is a different system and the regular tickets don't work between the systems but a transport pass does. I happen to live near one of the main stations, so I don't have to change lines and just go straight to my job in the suburbs that is only 1km away from the station where I can either walk or take a quick shuttle bus. Though I have been cheating a bit in August and taking the car since everyone is on vacation and traffic is so much less. I will also drive if I need to be somewhere at a specific time, run errands at some point, etc.

I am a very willing public transport commuter because it is cheaper, less stressful, and takes just as much time with traffic into account. We do own a car and wouldn't give it up. Our apartment comes with a parking space and I suppose it feels easier to pay the opportunity cost of not renting it out rather than paying someone else directly for the space. Public and Private transport are fundamentally different and serve different purposes. For example, groceries are a car thing just because the supermarket has free parking and it's so much easier. But generally moving around the city is something I do on transport. I find it is worth it to have a transport card and a car. Never mind for going between cities just as a couple or to visit family in small towns.

If I am going somewhere without my wife and will be in an urban area, I will usually Train/Fly as it ends up being cheaper/easier for a single person.

The rail systems are electric and buses are diesel, though I've been on a few hybrids as well. The scheduling is generally pretty good, it's often enough to not even worry about catching a specific train on the metro or bus, the regional rail has a set timetable and can be a bit annoying if you miss your particular train. e.g. the train direct to the airport from my house leaves every 30 minutes.

Bicycles are around here, but not that common. We don't really have the necessary bike infrastructure, temperatures can be very hot in the summer, drivers are insane, and the city has a fair number of hills. These all combine to sort of discourage biking. That said, there is a new bike share system that uses electric assist for the hills and if you stick to smaller streets that cars avoid, it can be much safer.

I think I'm pretty average in my opinion when I say I favor supporting both transport and car infrastructure as they are complements rather than enemies. People generally support the removal of general traffic from the old part of the city, which has been a success in some neighborhoods (only residents are allowed to drive there).

Away from the big city transport can vary wildly but there is almost always a decent bus system. The city centers are almost always small enough to walk or with decent transit. In the North there tends to be more cars due to more spread out people, worse weather, generally wealthier, and more hills/mountains.

All in all, it's pretty decent. I don't know that I would propose any huge capex type changes right now, just undoing some of the crisis effects and getting needed maintenance done and upping some service levels. Maybe add some express regional bus routes for people in further suburbs with limited stops.",0,1407841479,null,0,false,0,cjnyimm,t3_2dbhie,t1_cjnyimm,t3_2dbhie,null,1435196638,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,Maximovitch,null,null,"Je suis assez sidéré de la séduction que Chirac exerce toujours auprès de l'opinion publique. C'est vrai que Jacques à toujours été un séducteur... Mais à mes yeux, c'est aussi le pire Président de la Vème République, et sa carrière, bien qu'illustre, n'est pas toute rose. Il faut distinguer deux Chirac, celui d'avant et celui d'après 1995.

Le premier Chirac, c'est le Chirac jeune loup, celui qui gravit les marches jusqu'à l'Elysée. Et à ce petit jeu, Chirac représente l'archétype de l'ambitieux, dont les avancées ne se font qu'au détriment de ses alliés qu'il n'hésitera pas à trahir. Il y a d'abord la trahison en 1974 envers Jacques Chaban-Delmas et les gaullistes, pour rallier l'UDF de Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. Le coup lui rapportera Matignon. Puis c'est la rupture avec VGE après sa démission en 1976. Chirac se lance dans la course de la mairie de Paris en 1977 contre Michel d'Ornano, le candidat du Président, et remporte le trophée. Avec sa nouvelle machine, le RPR, il concurrence l'UDF et cause en partie son échec en 1981 face à Mitterrand. Et puis, l'ultime trahison, le coup de poignard dans le dos de son ""ami de trente ans"" Edouard Balladurd pour les présidentielles de 1995. Ascension, trahison, Chirac est digne du *Parrain*. 

Le Chirac Président, malheureusement pour lui, a exercé deux mandats médiocres dont l'un ne lui est dû qu'à cause de circonstances exceptionnelles. Enfin arrivé au titre suprême de monarque républicain en 1995, il fait la première erreur de composer un gouvernement de droite libérale avec Alain Juppé et Alain Madelin alors que sa majoritaire parlementaire est essentiellement balladurienne. Elle lui donnera du fil à retordre, de même que la rue qui dès l'été 1995 manifeste en masse. Cela explique en partie son choix fatal de dissolution de l'Assemblée nationale en 1997. Alors même que cet outil est conçu pour résoudre un conflit institutionnel ou obtenir une majorité une fois élu, Chirac ne l'utilise que pour ses convenances et son confort personnel et se paie en retour une cohabitation de cinq ans. En 2002, il ne doit sa réélection soviétique seulement grâce à Le Pen et ne débute avec guère de légitimité. Et puis en 2005, rebelote, nouvelle erreur, la campagne du ""oui"" au référendum sur le traité portant Constitution pour l'Europe l'engage personnellement et le résultat le discrédite définitivement pour le reste de son mandat. Affaibli, politiquement comme physiologiquement, il laisse son Premier ministre, successeur anobli, gouverner et perd en vain la discipline de l'UMP au fur et à mesure de l'essor de Sarkozy. Bilan: sur ses douze années de mandature, Chirac n'a gouverner réellement que cinq ans.

Alors je comprends que l'on aime l'homme. Il a cet esprit jovial, sympathique, bonhomme. On se souvient tous du léger ""Mangez des pommes !"", des V de la victoire, des poignées de mains à tout va, de la bière ou du salon de l'agriculture. Il fait également parti, comme tu l'as dis, d'une ancienne classe politique avec les François Mitterrand et Jean-Marie Le Pen et certains peuvent en être nostalgiques. Mais n'oubliez pas qu'il fut, et pas seulement pour ses problèmes de santé à la fin de son mandat, l'un des Présidents les plus médiocres de la Vème République où le Président incarne normalement la figure centrale.

The most you can hope for if you want to work for an Italian company starting from the bottom is a part-time job. I'm a freelance English teacher and translator; I work for myself but I also let other consulting companies farm me out to companies in the local area for English courses paid for by the region. It all depends on the funding from the region if my year is going to be a good one. In any case, I don't make much money at all; I make good money per hour, but I can go months without a single course. How do I make it?

My wife has a steady job and my income supplements it. We also own our own house here due to it being a fixer-upper handed down to her from her grandfather years ago. We decided to take an old, run-down house and fix it up rather than buy a new one and be in debt. It's not very big, but we're remodeling and have just added a loft/study/music room and extra bathroom in the attic. In Italy, you have to make do with what you have.

Italian wages are among the lowest in Europe. You have to reconcile yourself with the fact that you will NOT have a career if you choose to stay in Italy. You will get by, you will have a nice, relatively easy life, you will live in safety and security and the schools are excellent in comparison to what we have in the states, but you will not have a booming career. 

Strangely enough, do you know what my next plan is for the next couple of years? I wanna be a truck driver in Europe. I know, it sounds ridiculous, but I absolutely love the idea of traveling all over Europe in a long-haul truck. Unlike the states, the restrictions are very strict and the life is much easier to handle than that in the states, where they go out for months at a time and drive 11 hours a day. This is another thing I like about Italy; you do whatever you want to do and no one bothers you. There's no ""keeping up with the Joneses"" in Italy, unlike in the states where your entire life revolves around competing with someone else. 

Italia isn't for everyone; you have to be of a certain mindset and you have to be willing to change your habits in order to enjoy living here. That said, it's just as modern as anywhere else, even more so than some other countries. The bureaucracy is a thing but it's no worse than, say, Spain or Portugal.

The public transport itself is up to German standards, but the subway system appears to have all kinds of malfunctions fairly frequently, and the backup systems (usually buses) often get handled poorly in such situations (most notably it's often difficult to find out from where the f*ing bus is supposed to go).

Living without a car is certainly possible here, but due to the suburban sprawl and imo comparably low density of public transport lines, it's fairly inconvenient to not own a car. This is reason enough for me, personally, to move places once I got my diploma, as I find commuting by car fairly stressful in comparison to idly sitting in a train or bus or just walking, not to mention when everyone has to commute by car it makes the city unnecessarily noisy, and hanging out in public spaces is so much less desirable with a high amount of traffic.",0,1407843130,null,0,false,0,cjnyv8v,t3_2dbhie,t1_cjnyv8v,t3_2dbhie,null,1435196805,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

From the article:

&gt; 22 countries engaged

&gt;The European Union launched in February 2013 a 15-month training mission for Mali’s armed forces. The mission has been prolonged for two years. Eight battalions or battle groups, ie 5,600 soldiers, will be trained during the period 2013-2015 at the Koulikoro camp near Bamako. Twenty two EU member states \* are contributing to the mission, **which is mobilizing 570 European troops with a budget of €23 million (for 15 months)**. Switzerland and Canada are also participating.
\*Germany, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Spain, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, **Portugal**, Czech Republic, Romania, UK, Slovenia and Sweden.

$10 million for an economy of 16+ trillion dollars to a country that is helping, is symbolic. The EU as a whole, spent 23 million euros (~30 million dollars) to train the troops in Mali for two years.

The US gave a relatively small amount of money to a country who is helping fight terrorism. Portugal is, along with the EU, training the military of the people in Mali (like the US did in Iraq).

The only thing that I used to use public transport for was getting to school, but even that sucked and was only tolerable because I go to school in the same town. If you live anywhere else and go to school here it's not unlikely that you'll waste a lot of hours waiting for and/or sitting in busses.

Many young people (including me) try to get their own vehicle as soon as possible, so motorised scooters (which are age 15+) are pretty common, just like starting with your driving license as soon as you can. I'm really happy that I have my driving license and access to a car now, makes life a lot more interesting.

The biggest city in the area has about 100.000 inhabitants and if you're going to university there you'll likely be able to get there by bus, although students there complain about them a lot. Still, if I had a job there and would live in the city I would probably want to have a car anyways, I remember someone else on here calling it the most car centric city in Germany and I think that's pretty accurate.

&gt;That the technology has been in use for over 70 years?

[Appeal to tradition fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition) *and false*:

&gt;As far back as 1984, the USEPA reported on a clear case in which hydraulic fracturing fluids and natural gas from production operations contaminated a groundwater well in West Virginia, “rendering it unusable.”

 -

&gt;Of the last million fracked wells in the US, none of them have poisoned the water table. 

the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, *and there is evidence*


&gt;But we seem to get this bizarre image from German greens

Yeah, and let's not forget that what US industry lobbyists have done is all above board and beyond reproach!!

&gt;Some of the recommendations concerning oil and gas waste were eliminated in the final report handed to lawmakers in 1987.

&gt;“It was like the science didn’t matter,” Carla Greathouse, the author of the study, said in a recent interview. “The industry was going to get what it wanted, and we were not supposed to stand in the way.”

&gt;E.P.A. officials told her, she said, that her findings were altered because of pressure from the Office of Legal Counsel of the White House under Ronald Reagan. A spokesman for the E.P.A. declined to comment. 


and:

&gt; An early draft of the study discussed potentially dangerous levels of contamination in hydrofracking fluids and mentioned “possible evidence” of contamination of an aquifer. The report’s final version excluded these points, concluding instead that hydrofracking “poses little or no threat to drinking water.”

&gt;Shortly after the study was released, an E.P.A. whistle-blower said the agency had been strongly influenced by industry and political pressure. Agency leaders at the time stood by the study’s findings.

It's just Windermere. The suffix -mere tells you that it is a body of water. How many lakes are there in the Lake District? One! Bassenthwaite Lake. All the rest are meres, waters and tarns.

What is the difference? Well, a tarn and a water both from Old Norse. Tarn coming from the word for pond (*tjörn*) and is a mountain lake.

A water also comes from Old Norse and means.....lake! So it's just a etymological difference.

A mere, however, *is* different to a water/lake (although it still means lake). A mere is broad in relation to the depth.

Of course, there all ultimately mean lake, but only one of the them carries the name.

It is definitely a bit like a sport in that it can be exhausting if you like to drive fast, but I don't see that as a negative. It's my favourite way to commute, at least unless it's winter. I don't need to worry about finding a parking spot, it's dirt cheap, and I'm doing something for my health. 

Safety is usually not a big concern, if you drive on the road and assert yourself, car drivers will (in my experience) respect you and your right to participate in traffic. If you're timid and unsure or lack experience, I guess it can be a bit intimidating (driving on the road, among other traffic, is safer than driving on a special bike path on the curb btw). It may not be safer than tram (which is incredibly safe) but I accept that risk for all the benefits it gives me.

&gt;Thank you for taking the time, and effort, to write a detailed and informative post, adding information about the cases and questions I’ve raised.

Well done fracking operations may pose little or no risk: but millions of wells, poorly monitored, will cause more and more problems. Even if one-tenth of a percent (0.1%) of wells are “crappy” or “poor”, that is still 1,000 wells that may cause groundwater problems.

&gt;Donc ça veut dire qu'en voulant montrer que les hommes sont plus souvent violés que les femmes, tu viens de montrer en même temps que les hommes commettent certainement plus de 90% des viols, chiffre que tu disputais tout à l'heure.  

En suite, tu fais plein de petites erreurs.

Je vais juste reposter l'étude dont tu parles, au cas ou quelqu'un relirait cette discussion:

http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/svpjri0809.pdf

&gt;Mais on peut se référer à l'étude de 2008, qui donne quelques précisions en plus, ainsi que des ratios. On y lit que 1,9% d'hommes en prison et 1,3% d'hommes en jail dont agressés par un prisonnier, lorsque 2,9% en prison et 2,1% en jail sont agressés par le personnel.

Oui.

&gt;Cela veut dire que 39,5% des abus en prison et 38,2% des abus en jail sont commis par d'autres prisonniers, soit des hommes.

Tu oublies ""des abus en prison **sur des hommes**"". Les femmes commettent des abus sur d'autres femmes prisonnières aussi. Le fait est que la grande majorité de ceux qui violent les femmes en prison sont des femmes. Je te retourne l' argument comme quoi ce serait salutaire d'addresser le problème des hommes qui violent pour aider les hommes. Mais évidemment, les féministes, au mieux ignorent tout du problème femme qui violent, au pire mentent pour le maintenir caché. 

&gt;Selon le rapport : ""Among male victims of staff sexual misconduct, 69% of those in prison and 64% of those in jails reported sexual activity with female staff."" Donc 31% des abus en prison et 36% des abus en jail commis par le personnel ont été commis par des hommes, soit 18,75% du total en prison et 23% du total en jail. 

Une précision:

 &gt;Among male victims of staff
sexual misconduct, 69% of those in prison and 64% of
those in jails reported sexual activity with female staff. An
additional 16% of prison inmates and 18% of jail inmates
reported sexual activity with both female and male staff.

Par simplicité, pour maintenir un ratio de 1 pour 1, on compte ceux violés par les deux, moitié l'un moitié l'autre. Ce qui fait, pour les hommes violés par le personnel: 

prison: 77 % F , 23 % H

Jail: 72 % F, 28 % H

En pourcentage global, toujours sur les hommes, ça fait 53, 4% hommes violeurs et 46,6% de femmes violeurs en prison. Et 55,5 %H et 44,5% F en jail. 

Si tu rajoute le ""made to penetrate"" en dehors des prisons de l'autre étude avec ses 80% de femmes violeuses, la majorité de ceux qui violent des hommes sont clairement des femmes.

&gt;Le pourcentage global d'abus sexuels commis par les hommes est par conséquent 58,25% en prison et 61,2% en jail.

Encore une fois, c'est uniquement les abus sexuels commis sur les hommes tes chiffres.

&gt;Ayant fait le calcul on voit bien que les hommes sont responsables de la plupart des viols en prison, tout comme à l'extérieur.

Je n'ai jamais nié que les hommes forment la majorité des violeurs, je l'ai même répété plusieurs fois au cours de notre conversation:

&gt;Pourquoi je discuterais une position sur laquelle toi, moi et le reste de la société sont d'accord? Les hommes forment la majorité des violeurs et tout le monde le sait. 

Et

&gt;Mes sources indiquent plutot 60H-40F, mais on va pas chipoter.

&gt;Le féminisme prétend que le démantèlement du machisme sociétal aidera les hommes dans la mesure où il créerait des relations plus saines entre les sexes, enlèverait la pression que ressentent les hommes pour s'engager dans des métiers dangereux tels que soldat ou mineur, leur permettrait d'exercer plus librement des activités qui sont actuellement considérés inacceptables ou soupçonnables, et rendrait possible une discussion ouverte des problèmes que le machisme cherche à réduire, y compris la violence sexuelle.

Je n'y crois pas, tu devrais le savoir depuis le temps. Ce ne sont que des promesses vides de sens. Pourquoi les moutons croiraient-ils ce que disent les renards? Le féminisme est anti-hommes.

Other than that, whenever i need to go to San Sebastian for something, i either take [the bus, normally composed of newer Citaros ](http://i.imgur.com/B1RTSxa.jpg) or use the [Topo](http://i.imgur.com/tAt4CP7.jpg), the small train that connects France (Hendaye) with San Sebastian. I don't catch the [*Cercanias*](http://i.imgur.com/Oz54S8i.jpg) much because it has an erratic timetable while both the Topo's and the buses timetables are fixed (every half an hour), and it's not integrated into the province-wide contactless card system. If i need to get somewhere in Irún or just head to the mall, i take [the city bus.](http://i.imgur.com/nxySOGN.jpg) (every 15 mins)


I use public transport because i don't have a car nor license and we simply cannot afford to get a license either. Driving school can cost up to 3000€ and we'd rather use it for more important stuff. And of course, there's also huge parking issues and a city-wide 30kph limit, which pisses off a lot of drivers.

The buses aren't exactly the cleanest nor the least polluting. While they're getting replaced by newer buses, those new buses start malfunctioning a year in or so. The intercity bus fleet is very limited, which leads to huge crowding in the summer months and people getting left at bus stops due to a lack of space. It's ridiculous, considering many people use buses here.

There are some bike routes in Irún, but nobody uses them because they lead to nowhere. The bike routes in San Sebastian are better planned and get more use.

The smaller towns have it much worse, they either get one or two buses per 2 hours or more, or simply have none at all. Especially if you live in Navarre, only served by a long-haul bus route, or in France, who's transport system, well, just fucking sucks (trains stop opertaing in the evening and buses only arrive every hour and end at 8:00pm).

Problem? It's all fucking unreliable and in horrible condition. Some buses are almost falling apart, and timings are very erratic. Trains are better but only serve certain areas, and both trains and buses can get super crowded on certain routes and during certain timings, with the iconic 'people hanging out of the doors' sort of stuff common. 

The railway stations? They're pretty much non functional and are just empty spaces, except for a ticket counter. 2 - 3 floors of nothing but bare concrete. Toilets don't work and the stations look like no further construction has been done since the 90s.

Oh, and 30 degrees C and super humid weather here all the fucking time. Plus during the monsoon we have storms and super heavy rains, buses won't protect you from any of that. AC buses ply rarely and have thrice the rate of normal buses so that's not a real replacement.

The metro is something that might serve as a respite to all this since our other running metros are good (Delhi metro is said to be punctual and pretty world class in service and infrastructure, I went on Bangalore's metro was pretty good but only served 4 stops), but the delays have been too much. It's been going on for 3 years now, the planning took another 3 years, and it's gonna take at least another 2 years to be fully functional, but I have high hopes for it based on the other metro systems.

Other than that, travelling by train is expensive. A few days back I had to pay around 40 Euro for an Amsterdam-Groningen return ticket. Feels so bad because the day before I paid just a bit more than the double price for an ICE-high speed Vienna-Frankfurt-Amsterdam ticket..

Other than the idiotic prices, the railway system is one of the best of the world. Dutch people like to complain about it *a lot* , but in reality delays are relatively uncommon and the density of the railroad system is absurdly high. For long-distances the trains are comfortable; for the busy routes the [Regiorunners](http://www.rail-pictures.com/1024/irm-regiorunner-double-unit-is-7471.jpg) are used. For other routes the [Koploper](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/NS_Koploper_ICM_4227_verlaat_Utrecht_Centraal.jpg). On regional lines the [SLT](http://www.fransmensonides.nl/foto/slt_gd.jpg) is mostly used which I hate because it doesn't have a toilet and the seats are built for lilliputters. In the more rural areas the regional lines are run by Veolia, Arriva and a number of other companies.

For the other public-transport. I only really know it in Amsterdam. There are a lots of trams, which is not a really good system. There is a subway line with about 5 stops underground. The swampy ground of Amsterdam makes building a good subway very hard. They are trying to build a new subway-line but it turned out a lot harder than expected. It should have been opened in 2011 but now this is delayed to 2017. Not even to speak about the costs..

There's a government poll in the UK saying that the socialised NHS should remain socialised at 84 percent. That over 60 percent of the UK believe the energy companies should be re-nationalised and that over 60 percent believe the Royal Mail and the train companies should be re-nationalised also. 

This post from 2012 showed 93 percent support for re-nationalising the trains whilst the same year MSN reported 73 percent for re-nationalising the trains. Pick any poll regarding re-nationalising fundamental services in the UK and in the past 50 years and it'll be over 60 percent each time.

Here's Ha-Joon Chang (leading economics professor at Cambridge university) destroying the ""myth of free markets"" in 2 minutes. 

You only believe the markets are ""free"" because you don't see the government regulation of the markets because you ""agree with it"" so fully. For example in the 1800s when the UK started outlawing child labour  and restricting the hours a child could work you had employers arguing that the children want to work and the employers want to employ them.

But I didn't say there aren't bad examples of privatizations. 

I said that there are many instances where nationalization has made things worse.

Copypasta:

&gt; The recent ""Bailout"" of General Motors is a great example. Had GM been allowed to file Chapter 13 Bankruptcy (Reorganization), the court would have found a way to spread the pain and save the company. But what happened is that the literally millions of investors, including numerous retired people, were left with virtually nothing, the company was turned over the President Obama's union cronies, and the citizens of the US took shares that will never return to us what was ""loaned."" As I recall, without specifically looking up the exact numbers, the US gave GM $52 Million in exchange for shares of common stock that immediately declined drastically in value to something now on the order of about $17. The ""investors"" were mostly written off and union benefits were retained. While last month was a banner month for GM, touted by President Obama as proof of the goodness of the bailout, the company only showed a profit last month because the US Government bought a tremendous number of cars, many of them the Chevy Volts that GM cannot sell commercially. Soon, GM will lose further value, and will soon again be on the doorstep of bankruptcy. This was only partial nationalization. GM is now experiencing problems hiring top engineers and executives because the Government has created salary caps that are unrealistic for professional employees and not competitive with other companies in the same market.

&gt; Look at what Hugo Chavez did to oil companies and other industries in Venezuela. Owners were told to go pound sand, that the government now owned the companies and all of their resources. Foreign specialists who helped keep many of those plants running fled because wages for professionals and engineers were capped. Many of those facilities can no longer operate.

&gt; The greatest example of nationalization is probably the Soviet Union where all means of production were nationalized. People who grew vegetables in their yard were imprisoned or shot for not giving their produce to the Government to distribute. It was impossible to buy basic necessities like toilet paper because production was so poor. Nationalization simply does not work.

End copypasta.

true,OneRichBastard,ROMA,Wanna' see a trick?,"Not could, actually did, and continue to do so.

Does that mean I can't be against another country joining in or what?

Romania has a low income, and that's about it. All the other problems start from that, corruption included.

Crime? Bucharest is Europe's safest capital. The only crime we seem to know is, well, bribe - an artefact from communism times.

Other than that, what? We're white, European, Christian... and the last bit is important. I don't give a rat's ass about religion, but they (the Turks) do, so... that won't work, no.

In any case, I might be biased. Romanians never really loved the Turks...

There are other reasons why Turkey shouldn't join, mainly, it's four times the size (population-wise) of Romania, ten times than that of Bulgaria. It will never be able to fully control immigration, due to location. I mean look at Greece and Italy, they have been inside the EU for decades and still struggle with that issue.

Sure, people might have disagreed with Romania - for being poor - and mainly really, because of our main export - gypsy racketeers and pocket thieves.

However, my view is that culture is much more important than income levels. Romania is European, the culture is European, food, kings, queens, whatever have you - we struggled with our identity, sure, but we've always been European, and we've always been Christian, and that alone matters a lot. Why? Well simply put, try visiting Romania and decide how long it would take you to fit in. Not much.

It was and still is the same for the many Romanians immigrating in any EU country (especially Latin ones). They integrate within months. I mean the only thing to adapt to really is language. I've lived in three EU countries and haven't had a culture shock or seen anything very, very different.

&gt;In the meantime, however, an equally troublesome imbalance has emerged between Germany and the rest of the Europe. Germany’s current account surplus of 7 percent of GDP is now larger and more persistent than the Japanese or Chinese surpluses before the crisis. Yet on the global stage, Germany is not subjected to the same sort of pressures. Germany’s political dominance in Europe also makes it immune to the kind of demands for policy changes that Washington applied to Japan and China, while the existence of the euro rules out the currency adjustments that ultimately removed the imbalances between Asia and the United States.

Many of regulars here tend to burst and rant about (perceived, but not real) ''immunity'' described above. We choose our own words, and I'd hope that Germans don't mind when some of us exclaim open opposition to ''mini jobs'' miracles..., or other ''structural adjustments'' that rob people of decent living, as they screw economy for investors and workers alike - in plain sight.    

German policymakers should ditch their expectations about ''sound foundations''. There are none, you can keep inflicting pain on the people (including your own) or recognize that freedom isn't tidy; wheels simply won't spin without the [money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JDWJzKYfdc).

Zhirinovsky is not supposed to be taken seriously. He has, among other things, threatened to change the gravitional field of earth so the US is sunk and called the US a nation of faggots, cocksuckers and handjobbers.

Not only that, but he’s been pretty frank about his hatred for Turks and people from the Caucasus Mountains, as well as his desire for the Chinese and Japanese to be deported from Russia. He’s warned America several times to be careful about turning the country over to the blacks. He wants to forcibly take back Alaska because it’ll be “a great place to keep the Ukranians.” In Zhirinovsky’s dream world, all of the former Soviet countries will get back together, the ethnic minorities will murder each other, Russians will rule, Georgians will serve as slaves, and the Baltic countries will be used for the dumping of nuclear waste. Oh, and they need to seize Afghanistan and the Middle East so that Russians have somewhere warm to go on vacation.

When the bird flu was spreading around the world in 2006, world leaders everywhere were scrambling and trying to figure out what to do. But Zhirinovsky, who is a man of action, came up with a simple solution: just shoot all the birds.

He argues that if women were self-sufficient, they wouldn’t need the endless supply of furs and shoes that apparently drives men to their graves. And in 2006, Zhirinovsky proposed that polygamy be legalized in Russia.
