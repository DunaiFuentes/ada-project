note I dont like loans.

I cant afford to get my car fixed unless i save for months and that means living without many things. same goes for computer.. and camera.. i got old cell phone that barely works.
I survive on disability pension my biggest problem is not affording all the therapy i need to function better. I grow food to help myself. I make crafts i sell or trade for products.

I have a life. yes not a glamorous one but i have a roof and a car.. kinda.. 

the other big problem i have with my situation is that i live in rural Iceland. and i just dont get the help and support others in same situation as me get because they live in the capitol. 

I would love to be able to allow myself more luxury. like going to physical therapy two times a week.

I stopped watching the politics and things because they dont do nothing for me and just confuse me. 
I let go of little things so i can have medicine and food, not so hard but it affects the quality of life I live.
I dont get new mobile phone, new glasses until old one brakes, get used clothes and used furniture and many other little things.

oh one thing also that bothers me.
Because I am not in a wheelchair and gained a lot of weight after a really bad accident I am looked at as fat and lazy by many.

Regarding Irish pols. I tend to classify them as stupid most of the time but only evil occasionally.

It's also worth considering what would have happened if we had let the banks fail. Their assets (for BOI and AIB) were primarilly mortgages which were in many cases in arrears / default. Somewhere round 20% I believe. These assets would have been bought by another party at some kind of discount - presumably a larger bank somewhere which would then look to realise what they could from them.

At this point it's in the realm of conjecture what would have happened but I dont think a larger foreign bank would care at all about trying to keep people in Ireland from having their houses reposessed. I'm sure many people here do not feel the Irish banks have treated them well but at least BOI and AIB are local institutions which do not like to see their names in derogatory stories in the papers.

Sure they can. It is called upgrading.

&gt;Because at some point, the technology ceases to be profitable / safe / up to date? 

The current technology is extremely safe and when it goes out of date we don't actual demolish the whole thing, we upgrade it.

As for profitable. For nuclear factories (with the current technology) to stop being profitable, the price of electricity would have to drop to fractions of a cent for every euro we pay today. Fingers crossed for such technology to be invented, but it isn't yet.

&gt;Is it that hard to see that, if you build a plant, you will demolish it at some point?

Yes, because it is completely unessesary. 

&gt;The state will invest by subsidizing research as well as installation of reneweables resources and building the network necessary to run the net intelligently. Renewables currently need a smart-grid and large-scale energy storage only Scandinavian countries have at the moment.

And all of that will cover a grand total half of our current needs. And I am probably being generous here. Post-industrial societies run on electricity and we need a shitload of it.

&gt;Because that's how it works, usually. So you argue that energy production should be state-owned?

Certainly the state should strive to be self-sufficient in electricity (and other basic resources). I also certainly don't oppose private initiates though.

Sure, we can flip from Democrats to Republicans and back again -- and I'm not saying that doesn't matter -- but the changes are more cosmetic. I still feel like the Icelandic government works for *somebody*. Unfortunately, in the current government's case it's bankers and fishing magnates, but that can change.

Stop there immediatly please. We do not need to use our vast resources for a cause that is not ours, especially if it does not get to *the core* of the problem. My proposal (of course not an original one, as it is shared by many) does not root in populism or whatever despicable superficial ideology that is out there in Europe. I simply believe that working as a magnet on other countries, and pulling in people that reasonably are more of a strain than an advantage on our systems of government, does not pay off in the end.
 
It will result in people being send back after residing in [insert European country] for many years. That leads to terrible situations, as people will be once again be deprived of their home. You inadvertently support such tragedies by saying that we should do more, as you seem to have a favorable view towards illegal immigration.

Not to say that I am completely against immigration: it does serve its purpose, as long as the formalities of our legal system are observed. Simply crossing into Europe without consent of the country in which you are trespassing for me is enough reason to ban someone from entering Europe for the rest of his life. 

&gt; As for your proposal of closing the borders of Europe: how would you set this up? It's notoriously difficult to build walls on the sea.

Increasing navy patrols in the Mediterranian (as has happened already), as well as European funding for known 'problem areas', such as Italy, Greece, Malta and others. If necessary all the manpower and resources could be brought under the direction of the European Commission if there is good reason to do so. 

Next to that, countries bordering the Mediterranian but that are not a part of the European Union (for example Libya) should be stabilized to ensure that the government apparatus  on the other side of the sea also functions. In that situation I am pretty much against sending money, but sending experts and other personnel should help in aiding governments to stop such practices on their shores. 

It is far from impossible to implement such policies: the only thing required is money. Given how much of a strain illegal immigration is on the average European welfare state the choice should be easily made.

Surely, that cannot happen. Any troop movements from other European nations will be monitored by Russia and if only a few start landing in the Donbass region, that entire region might immediatly be subjected to the fires of total war. Why? Because those thousands (if not tens of thousands of soldiers) still on Russia's side of the border will cross over. 

I am not against sending troops, but we surely should not send them to the Donbass region. The best solution would be securing the de facto borders as they exist in Ukraine today. That would benefit Ukraine, and Russia might back down a little in that case. No matter how you turn it: the Donbass region and Crimea are lost until the Russian state in its current form comes to an end (which is not any time soon). 
 
Letting this conflict go on will probably be much more damaging to Russia than it is for European nations. If European leaders are keen on teaching Putin a lesson - which seems to be the case - it will be beneficial for them to maintain those sanctions.

false,Nilbop,IREL,Ireland,"&gt; Surely, that cannot happen. Any troop movements from other European nations will be monitored by Russia and if only a few start landing in the Donbass region, that entire region might immediatly be subjected to the fires of total war. Why? Because those thousands (if not tens of thousands of soldiers) still on Russia's side of the border will cross over. 

If you believe Russia will declare war on the EU, nevermind one that hasn't declared on *them*, I've got a lambda with a 3 next to it to sell you. 

Even more so than that, this is an important point for the EU to take charge of it's own interests on it's own borders and, if requested, provide decsiive aid to a nation applying in good-faith for membership.

&gt; I am not against sending troops, but we surely should not send them to the Donbass region. The best solution would be securing the de facto borders as they exist in Ukraine today. That would benefit Ukraine, and Russia might back down a little in that case. No matter how you turn it: the Donbass region and Crimea are lost until the Russian state in its current form comes to an end (which is not any time soon). 

That's absurdly defeatist logic and pathetically appeasing to a phantom Russian force that officially doesn't exist. You don't cede sovereign land to the threat of beligerent tyrants, you oppose them. Appeasement of totalitarian states never works.

&gt; Letting this conflict go on will probably be much more damaging to Russia than it is for European nations. If European leaders are keen on teaching Putin a lesson - which seems to be the case - it will be beneficial for them to maintain those sanctions. 

I've no doubt about that, but the goal shouldn't be to damage Russia, it should be to restore Ukraine to it's position before Russia invaded.

You assume immediatly that Russia will simply take attacks on both regions, even Crimea which is the homebase of the vital Black Sea Fleet. Do you really, honestly, believe that Russia will simply let go of those regions? If it really were so easy this would have been done by now.

Die momentane Situation Russlands wird sehr gerne mit dem Vorlauf zum ersten Weltkrieg verglichen. Vergleiche mit dem zweiten Weltkrieg sind allesamt lächerlich oberflächlich, dememtsprechend werde ich sie hier ignorieren.

Tatsächlich erinnert Russland als mächtige Mittelmacht die endlich als Großmacht akzeptiert werden möchte an das deutsche Kaiserreich. Und ebenso wirken EU und USA sehr wie die Allierten von damals: Man versuchte Deutschland zu diplomatisch und wirtschaftlich zu isolieren, als sich die Gelegenheit bot, den Aufstieg Deutschlands zu unterbrechen, nutzte man diese. Zwar wurde Deutschland im Vertrag von Versailles die alleinige Kriegsschuld zugesprochen, allerdings sollte man auch versuchen zu verstehen, dass die Großmächte von damals, viele Chancen für eine friedliche Lösung ignorierten und die Zentralmächte in eine absolut bedrohliche Situation brachten. 

Die Lektion muss also lauten, und das zeigen auch die Folgen des Vertrags von Versailles, dass eine Mischung aus Respekt, Hilfe und klaren Regeln der einzige Weg ist, das friedliche Beisammensein von Großmächten zu garantieren.

Nun sprichst du außerdem die Regeln an, die uns als Grundlage des internationalen Rechts dienen sollen. Tatsächlich hat Putin Recht, dass wenn das Völkerrecht gerecht ist, die Annexion der Krim nicht anders zu behandeln ist als der Kosovo. Es mag sein, dass Russland das völkerrecht möglichst weit dehnt, aber brechen, tun sie es normalerwise nicht. *hust*Iraq*hust*

Die Einhaltung der Menschenrechte ist sicherlich ein großes Problem in Russland, aber bevor wir andere ankreiden sollten wir wohl selbst erstmal keine Leichen mehr im Keller haben. Waffenexporte an die Saudi, zum Beispiel, disqualifizieren uns als stolze Verteidiger der Menschenrechte.

Nope. It's the smallest country next to Syria, and thus presents the most compelling argument. But don't act like the other neighbouring countries aren't doing their fair share. Turkey accepted 2.5 million refugees, and Jordan 1.5 million. The most generous country in Europe is Sweden, who accepted 150.000. And that's the single most generous of them.

&gt;We do not need to use our vast resources for a cause that is not ours, especially if it does not get to *the core* of the problem.

If the cause of ""helping other human beings out of probable injury and death"" is not yours, it's pretty sad. I'm not talking about giving each Syrian or Eritrean refugee a house and a Ferrari upon arrival, I'm saying we let them in. *The core*, as you say, of the problem, is civil war in Syria and a murderous crazy dictatorship in Eritrea. There is literally nothing we can do about that without worsening it. All we can do is nurse the victims, and help the neighbouring countries to deal with the fallout. But we are to selfish even for that.

I am also opposed to your idea that immigration makes countries poorer -- the USA allowed uncontrolled immigration during the entire 19th century and became, during that time period, one of the biggest powers in the world.

&gt;Simply crossing into Europe without consent of the country in which you are trespassing for me is enough reason to ban someone from entering Europe for the rest of his life. 

So how should asylum seekers seek asylum? Simply have them ask for a visa, or come legally by plane! This is after all so easy to do when a murderous dictatorship has seized all your belongings!

Was hier abläuft ist unglaublich. Zurück in die Zeiten tiefster Dunkelheit. Jedes Stück Freiheit was man heute den Mohammedanern abnimmt wird man irgendwann allen Menschen abnehmen. Woher ich das weiß? Jedes Sicherheitsgesetz was ursprünglich zur Bekämpfung von bestimmten Straftaten durchgesetzt wurde, wird heute gegen alle Menschen eingesetzt. 

Als Beispiel die Totalüberwachung. Mohammedanische Terroristen wurden auch vor dem 11.September überwacht. Danach kamen einfach alle Menschen in diese Kategorie.

Deshalb sollte man bei jeder Grundrechtseinschränkung die dieser Staat gegen die Mohammedaner ergreift aufs schärfste protestieren.

Die Propagandapresse spielt natürlich wieder auf Regierungsseite. Skandalisieren, mehr Befugnisse für die Geheimen fordern, Angst vor Mohammedanern erzeugen, hetzen.

&gt; I am also opposed to your idea that immigration makes countries poorer -- the USA allowed uncontrolled immigration during the entire 19th century and became, during that time period, one of the biggest powers in the world.

On the backlash of massive economic growth in a completely different economy. It goes with saying that this comparison is invalid, as the situation nowadays (with a Europe that it deep in recession) is something completely else. Also: immigration in the U.S. for a long time led to segregation in that country, something which only mainly stopped only after WW2 was over. 

&gt; So how should asylum seekers seek asylum? Simply have them ask for a visa, or come legally by plane! This is after all so easy to do when a murderous dictatorship has seized all your belongings! 

Sadly, that is what  is boils down: ask for a visa. Observe the rules we have put forward, and don't break them. People don't do that, because they know that only very few refugees are granted entry into Europe. The people that are necessary for rebuilding the country, and actually improving it are very much *required* after the war/dictatorship is over. Once again: facilitating a brain drain into Europe will actually make these countries poorer. 
 
The effects on illegal immigration on national budgets are more than mediocre, unless you want to doubt Italy its earlier comments that it is buckling under the weight of illegal immigration. The pecuniary disadvantages for the treasury are real, and should be prevented.
 
Also: we could still do our share in helping humanity by decently funding various NGO's working in the sector we are talking about. It is not like taking up immigrants is the only way we can get rid of this false sense of moral blame.

Egli sosteneva, e credo giustamente, che quella fetta di piccola borghesia che frequentava le universita' che si dichiarava di sinistra, non era altro che una schiera di figli di papa' e abienti senza alcuna visione popolare o socialista.
Essi sono cresciuti lontani dall'indigenza o dalle vere lotte popolari comuniste; sono stati sempre protetti dai buoni salotti, poi, finiti gli anni settanta, quella generazione del '68 ha trovato lavoro nei lucrosi e capitalistici anni '80 che hanno capovolto lo scenario sociale italiano.

[Qui](http://www.pasolini.net/poesia_ppp_pciaigiovani.htm) Pasolini scrive degli accadimenti di Valle Giulia, a Roma nel 1968, descrivendo la sua posizione in quello scontro a favore dei poliziotti perche' veri poveri e quindi veri proletari.

I tempi sono cambiati ed il significato di sinistra non esiste piu' in Italia. Il PD, nel corso degli anni, ha cambiato tattica e gestione nella sfera della sinistra italiana, da quella moderata a quella radicale, applicando la strategia del ""Divide et impera"" e facendo tale che molte correnti rosse fossero in contrasto tra di loro.

[Nanni Moretti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ-J3eaHEO0) nel 2002 gia' prevedeva che il centro sinistra (pre-PD) non sarebbe andato da alcuna parte con quei dirigenti di allora. Successivamente, con l'avvento del berlusconismo, la 'seduzione' nel saltar banco da sinistra a destra sembra aver preso piede nelle schiere dei partiti ""rossi"", i quali si sono trasformati in un parito sempre piu' conservatore e sempre piu' distante dal popolo e dalle sue vere necessita'.

Correnti a sinistra del PD sono piccole e radicalizzate, quasi operanti in clandestinita' e lontane dai riflettori, specialmente quando gli esponenti del PCI si sono spostati sempre di piu' verso il centro o verso destra, e comportandosi come i borghesi che sono sempre stati.

&gt; 'Russia cannot attack the EU, because there will be reprisals --&gt; MAD doctrine --&gt; everyone loses'.

This goes without saying.

&gt; 'Europe cannot the Donbass region and Crimea, as they are being seen as part of Russia, as such there will be reprisals --&gt; MAD doctrine --&gt; everyone loses'. 

This does not, and here's why:

a) I am not advocating an EU attack on Russia, I am advocating for the return to the rule of law before the invasion of Ukraine, a prospective EU state right on our borders, by a foreign power, and the mechanism for this return is an EU military intervention in Ukraine by Ukraine's request to subdue Ukrainain rebels.

b) Donbas and Crimea are not Russian, period. I do not subscribe to your arguement that a state can illegaly invade another because it is bigger and say it's taking over *and then I have to accept that.* That's flat-out wrong. The Crimean theatre is currently stable and under total occupation by Russia; the Donbas is not, and needs to be pacified and stabilized before Putin makes good on his increasing rhetoric. At what point will you find  yourself rationalizing that Kiev is an adequate sacrifice for peace of mind, and thus the EU cedes integrity and influence on it's borders to a belligerent pariah state?

c) MAD is a mutual fear and it's absurd that pro-Putinists are using it as a threat against EU intervention. Neither the EU nor Russia will utilize their nuclear arsenal. Period. You know it, I know it, Merkel, Cameron, Hollande and Putin know it. It's blustering and nothing more and not a factor for a rational actor.

&gt; You assume immediatly that Russia will simply take attacks on both regions, even Crimea which is the homebase of the vital Black Sea Fleet.

The Donbas is Ukranian territory, not Russia. I wouldn't expect them to act if China invaded Ulaan Baatar, either, and **they certainly would not declare war on the EU when the EU is attacking Ukranian rebels within the Ukraine.** To suggest otherwise is *absurd.*

For the record, I've not advocated an attack on Crimea. *That* is under Russian military occupation and will need to be a separate, likely prolonged negotiation process once the Donbas has been stabilized.

&gt; A beautiful ideological point of view, although I don't share it.

Then by all means, cite my a situation where appeasing a dictator has led to peace and prosperity for the different actors, because I can't think of any.

&gt; There is no point in taking back a few hundred kilometers of Ukrainian soil if that starts a massive war between the West and Russia. 

At what point did we did Ukranian soil was worth less than Dutch soil? A few hundred kilometres of Ukranian soil is the size of Ireland, and considerably bigger than the whole of the Netherlands.

And regardless, you are retreading old, false arguements that Russia will declare war on the EU to protect it's insurgency in the Donbas. That's absolutely ridiculous. They'd lose so much for, as you call it, ""a few hundred kilometres of soil.""

&gt; I do not prefer 'appeasement', but because our leaders were so slow to react, sending soldiers to the Donbass region is out of the question now.

There is *literally* nothing to back this up. It is *in it's entirety* your opinion.

&gt; What you are proposing will only make the situation worse: because important principles of international law were violated, we should respond and by doing so create an even more dangerous situation. 

Yes, because international law was violated on our borders, we should respond within legal means - say at the invitation of the Ukranian President for military aid - and stabilize an ally on those borders, while sending a message to beligerent states that invasion and land-theft will not be tolerated within the boundaries of Europe. This *ends* the bloodshed in Ukraine and likely sends a huge blow to Putin's dictatorship, which now cannot fall back to jingoism to distract from a crashing currency and moribund economy. Your Cold-War era fear where Russia attacks the entire EU because the EU is putting down a Ukranian rebellion within Ukranian borders is simply not based in reality. The point at which Putin admits the men being killed by EU soldiers in Luhansk and Donetsk are his is the moment where he admits he was invading all along and loses all political capital.",0,1416243138,null,0,1416243646,0,cm533po,t3_2mk4z0,t1_cm533po,t1_cm526ac,null,1425981981,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

He went as a whale. But as he approached the land he went west to the north of the land. He saw that all mountains and hills were full with landvættir, some large but some small.
*Sá fór í hvalslíki. En er hann kom til landsins fór hann vestur fyrir norðan landið. Hann sá að fjöll öll og hólar voru fullir af landvættum, sumt stórt en sumt smátt.*

But as he approached Vopnafjörður, he sailed in and meant to walk upon land.

*Þá fór ofan eftir dalnum dreki mikill og fylgdu honum margir ormar, pöddur og eðlur og blésu eitri á hann.*

But he fled westward (in water), all the way to Eyjafjörður. Went he in that fjord. against him came a bird so great that the wingspan measured between the two mountains to his sides and a great host of other birds, both large and small.
*En hann lagðist í brott og vestur fyrir land, allt fyrir Eyjafjörð. Fór hann inn eftir þeim firði. Þar fór móti honum fugl svo mikill að vængirnir tóku út fjöllin tveggja vegna og fjöldi annarra fugla, bæði stórir og smáir.* 

He coursed out of there and west across the land, then south to Breiðafjörður and headed there into a fjord. against him came a large bull that waded into the sea and starts to ""moo"" ferociously. With him was number of landvættir.
*Braut fór hann þaðan og vestur um landið og svo suður á Breiðafjörð og stefndi þar inn á fjörð. Þar fór móti honum griðungur mikill og óð á sæinn út og tók að gella ógurlega. Fjöldi landvætta fylgdi honum.* 

Coursed he from there and took south to Reykjanes and wanted to walk upon Víkarsskeiði. Opposed him a mountain-giant with an iron staff in hand and his head held higher than the mouintains and many other giants(jötunn) with him
*Brott fór hann þaðan og suður um Reykjanes og vildi ganga upp á Víkarsskeiði. Þar kom í móti honum bergrisi og hafði járnstaf í hendi og bar höfuðið hærra en fjöllin og margir aðrir jötnar með honum*.

false,SteiniDJ,ICEL,Iceland,"A point about the doctors strike. 

They would never go strike in full force; that would go against all they've worked for and set the country against them (which, is seemingly very much for the strike and hopes that it will result favorably for doctors). 

Strikes are planned a few weeks in advance, for two days at a time, and only select departments the public health strike at a time. We have physicians today, as well as another department whose name I'm not capable of translating into English. On the 19th and 20th, we'll have internal medicine as well as Akureyri's hospital. The full schedule can be seen here: http://www.lis.is/lis/Frettir/nanar/7290/ny-verkfallslota-hefst-i-dag-hja-laeknafelagi-islands-

So, quite a bit more than emergency services are available - thankfully. The government is offering a seemingly standard wage increase of 2.8% while doctors are hoping for 30 - 50%, something which wouldn't even bring them close to Nordic standards. For those unfamiliar with the field of medicine in Northern Europe, Icelandic doctors are very eligible when it comes to employment opportunities in Europe, where wages can be almost 4 times higher. For reference, the highest salary a specialist working in the public field can have in Iceland is 540.000 kr / month (3500 EUR), before overtime and taxes. Some specialists, such as physicians, are practically barred from entering the private sector without rare deals with the government. Only a few have managed to enter it so far with limited success.

Equipment is lacking as well. The main hospital in Iceland seems to rely solely on donations, as federal funding is inefficient which has caused patient care to be minimal and wait times abysmal. It's amazing that so many doctors have remained despite these shortcomings in their field. 

The doctors I've spoken with in Iceland have become very upset with the current proceedings and the condition of the public health industry in Iceland. They are increasingly looking for employment opportunities elsewhere - something which will result horribly for the general population.

Another issue is the Icelandic University and its health department. If memory serves, it admits 48 students every year who have gone through very hard entrance exams. These exams are unpredictable and at times irrelevant to the field, yet they persist on maintaining it. Potential doctors often don't bother with entrance exam, or simply fail it, and head to Europe to learn the profession there.

false,Parabellum8g,NETH,Indifference is the best kind of tolerance (/s),"Sigh, this is going to be a long drawn out argument. Where to start?

&gt; a) I am not advocating an EU attack on Russia, I am advocating for the return to the rule of law before the invasion of Ukraine, a prospective EU state right on our borders, by a foreign power.

This will need, no matter how you turn it, the consent of Russia. Russia is not a state of law as of 2014, nor will it be next year unless something extraordinary happens. In order to get what you want here, you will be forced to snatch it away from the jaws of Russia.

&gt; b) Donbas and Crimea are not Russian, period. I do not subscribe to your arguement that a state can illegaly invade another because it is bigger and say it's taking over and then I have to accept that. That's flat-out wrong. 

First of all: nowhere did I approve of the criminal actions of the Kremlin. I simply foresee the use of other, much less extreme means than you are proposing here. It might be a bit easier reasoning from the safety of Ireland (which could, next to Iceland, not be in a safer spot in Europe) but when you get further into the European mainland you will notice that people have more reservations towards such actions. 

To say that Donbass and Crimea are not Russian, is *partially* wrong by default. You cannot deny that the Donbass region as well as Crimea have a very large Russian presence among the populace, amounting to a majority in those regions (varying from 50 to 70 percent). 

As a result you could say that it is Ukrainian by virtue of being recognized as Ukrainian soil (also because of Khrushchev his mistake), but by doing so you fail to appreciate the right of self determination of people. Wait! I can already hear you moving around your chair in disbelief, as we both know that the unrest in Donbass is very likely a coordinated effort instigated by Russia. 

That does not mean that people in eastern Ukraine were happy with the way Ukraine was before. Just take a look at the results of previous elections and you can see the massive divide that has characterised this country for a long time. It goes without saying that there never was 'one people' in Ukraine since 1991, and you should take this into account to some extent. Acknowledge, just like me, that Russia is stirring up things up in the Donbass region and beyond, but at the same time recognize that present day Ukraine is far from perfect. You could ask yourself if a federal state will ever get there with the current government.

&gt; c) MAD is a mutual fear and it's absurd that pro-Putinists are using it as a threat against EU intervention. Neither the EU nor Russia will utilize their nuclear arsenal. Period. You know it, I know it, Merkel, Cameron, Hollande and Putin know it. It's blustering and nothing more and not a factor for a rational actor.

I don't know if you are referring to me as a 'pro-putinist': if so, this subreddit is indeed degrading. Simply because I dissent does not mean I am even remotely pro-Kremlin. Nothing is 'period' when it comes down to MAD: if one side feels threatened enough it could push the proverbial red button as a form of retaliation. It might not happen in the way of a global nuclear holocaust, but nuclear strikes might become an option if western nations start meddling in the Donbass region.

Rationality and war are rarely reconciliable with one another. Especially now Putin got less to lose with each passing day, we should surely not provoke him. That is not cowardice, but wisdom. Don't corner a wild animal, because who knows what might happen.  Above all: we should not take chances as you are proposing here and simply accept the risk that a nuke might hit Kiev. 

&gt; Then by all means, cite my a situation where appeasing a dictator has led to peace and prosperity for the different actors, because I can't think of any.

This question isn't sound, as there will always be at least one party that loses during a dictatorship. If you are referring to 'peace and prosperity' for the appeasing countries, the answer would obviously be that it works from time to time, depending on the countries involved.  It can even create strong economic ties, as we have seen with Libya, Saudi Arabia and Egypt for example,

Anyway: the fact that you imply that it is negative by default is - sorry to put it this way - a juvenile conclusion. I believe you are stuck with 'appeasement politics' in the back of your head, as those were used against Hitler before the start of WW2.  It goes without saying that there are more examples out there, and the answer is not obvious. 

&gt; At what point did we did Ukranian soil was worth less than Dutch soil? A few hundred kilometres of Ukranian soil is the size of Ireland, and considerably bigger than the whole of the Netherlands.

It is worth less than **peace**. **That is my damn point**, contrary to the warmongering you are bringing forward here. You are one of those guys, forgive me for the ad hominem, that will set the world ablaze for his own selfish desires. There is no point *at all* in starting a new global war. I'll take this into account as well:

&gt; And regardless, you are retreading old, false arguements that Russia will declare war on the EU to protect it's insurgency in the Donbas. That's absolutely ridiculous. They'd lose so much for, as you call it, ""a few hundred kilometres of soil.

Once again: if it were so easy, European soldiers would have landed in Ukraine **a long time ago** already. Nothing is ridiculous in this scenario, especially when your opponent does not have much more to lose. Russia has been crippled economically and now you are challenging Putin for a fight. Of course he will accept the challenge, of course he will show the world that Russia is a 'proud' nation that will not back down. I don't know if you have actually watched Putin his comments over the past few months, or have any insight in his personality, but this man is *clearly* unpredictable  and will do the unexpected thing. 


&gt; Your Cold-War era fear where Russia attacks the entire EU because the EU is putting down a Ukranian rebellion within Ukranian borders is simply not based in reality.

Bottom line: you downplay the risk of global war, I don't. I just look at history and know how close we were a few times before. There is no reason to look for the limit, nor to spill the blood of our soldiers in a counter-attack that might not even be supported by the local populace (in the Donbass and Crimea). 

Your absolutist statement that this is not based 'in reality' goes beyond understanding why we actually have peace nowadays.  

Wrap up: the EU could send soldiers to Ukraine, but only to secure the *de facto* borders as they exist nowadays, that being north of Crimea, and West of the Donbass.

First be prepared for multiple trips to the vet before you leave. Your pets will need a international microchip, a certificate of health, and a rabies shot within 30 days of travel. Once you collect all the documents from your vet you will then need to present them to a USDA vet to get yet another certificate and pay more money! 

We spoke with the airline several times before flying. Yes we have two dogs and they are both booked to fly with us. They even called the night before to confirm the size of their crates. We get to the airport the next day and surprise, the plane only has room for one dog to fly in the cargo hold. So we sent one dog with another plane and hoped she would be there when we arrived in Germany. Got to Frankfurt and no one can tell me if my dog has arrived. We get on our connecting flight and I was very happy to see both of our dog kennels waiting to be loaded on the plane. But wait, the ground crew is standing around the crates and there seemed to be a problem. Once again the plane can only carry one dog. So my dog would be on the next flight and they would drive her to our house. Got a call later in the evening that my dog was still in Frankfurt and would now be driven the 3+ hrs to our house. She finally arrived after 1am. She had been in her crate for almost 24 hrs. The Frankfurt crew said they would take her out but I doubt that they did. 

On to the housing issue. I'm pretty sure you won't be able to rent a apt with that many dogs. So you will have to find a house to rent. Renting here is like a competition. You may go see a house and love it but the owner will see who else shows up and decide later who they want to rent to. You will also probably have to find something outside of the city, where the demand to rent isn't so great. The last time we moved we found only 2 houses that would rent to us, because we had pets, in a 30 km radius of where my husband's work is. 

You will also need to pay a yearly tax on each dog and be required to have dog insurance too. Depending on how long you've had your dogs you may need to take a class for a dog license when you arrive.  

Boarding pets here is not as easy as in the US. It's very expensive and there are not very many pet hotels/doggy daycare type places. We used to board our dogs all the time in the US no problem and now we end up taking our dog almost everywhere with us, which is ok, but it makes it really hard when you want to go on vacation.

There are German songs which can make a stranger to the language cry. That shows that the sound of the words is correct -- it interprets the meanings with truth and with exactness; and so the ear is informed, and through the ear, the heart.

You are then billed according to this new value. However, you are only charged for a part of the increase caused by price indexing.

Lectures are usually kept in the morning from monday to saturday, as the afternoon is reserved for homework. The grading system is usually from 1 to 10, with 6 being the minimum approbatory score.

Primary school lasts 5 years, comprehensive school 3 years and upper-secondary school 4-5 years.

After comprehensive school, students can enroll to a high school, a vocational school or a professional school. There is a great variety of these schools and, for each of them, a discrete selection of programs, which are, however, fixed: students cannot enroll to specific courses.

Examples of high school types are Liceo Classico, based on human studies, and Liceo Scientifico, based on science studies.

English is mandatory since primary school and students are also required to study English literature. The goal is to make students reach a B2 or C1 level, depending on their attitude. However, most students only reach B1 and some even A2.

Io però credo con tutto me stesso che sia giusto quello che mi dice Gesù e agisco di conseguenza.

Sì credo che ogni pensiero che si discosti sia sbagliato perché non mi porta verso la felicità (che è lo stare bene con sé stessi e in mezzo agli altri) e queste cose non me le dice nessuna religione e nessuna filosofia, quindi ""presumo"", quindi ""ne traggo il fatto che"" Gesu Cristo sia in qualche modo una rivelazione per il mondo di quello che un dio vuole da noi.

than read the rest ...and tell me seriously that europe isnt integrated...we are now almost like usa (the schengen agreement countries), no customs, eu partly regulates national budgets..etc.
we even have some EU army units.... nad in this situation UK wants more benefits tahn poor romania...
point of eu is that we come to similar economic levels so taht romanians and poles wouldnt go to UK for work...
 
 i really dont care for public opinion because public opinions start world wars...and can be easily manipulated through stupid poll questions and demagogs

if u ask people if they want eternal peace they will say yes, but if u ask, are u for eu?, than its no, while forgeting that eu was created so that europe wouldnt wage any kind of war amongst themselves...
people think with hearts and not brains.

in the days after ww2 european nations had a few really good statsmen who did what was right in long therm (obviously because they were scared of wars being a generation that has seen 2 WW) , unlike these cunts today...who only think in short term political benefits for themselves and their election results...

britain has more benefits from eu than germany or france? why?
britain holds large chunk of eu market which it wouldnt have if they were out...and still their politicians keep undermining the eu project..
isnt that counterproductive?
i think that british politicians act like this because it is easy to get votes on cheap nationalistic passions...like we won both wars and now germans rule europe...lets screw them all

and to return to usa now...read Manifest Destiny to see what is the land of liberty about...

It is obvious that no superpower would like 20 something eu countries to became one entity in international  relations... Germany is the biggest exporter in the world with 80 mil ppl and land thats half texas...
so do we really need to discuss the benefits of united europe?, socially economicallly and culturaly most progresive region of the world?? 
DO you think that USA would like a superstate emerging on world scene??
Euro becomes the most important currency in trade and goodbye american prosperity....
they shit their pants when iran decided to trade their oil in euros.
There are lots of reddits explaining the relation of $ and the invincible image of USA in world relations.
Essentially the price of $ is more connected to 7 USA aircraft carriers than with all the gold they have in fort knox.

Usa calls britain to wars and they always go just to keep the image of a superpower..with their 4 nuclear submarines lol and american missles... 
they dont need them but a trojan horse in eu is always nice...and britain feels important...WE ARE EMPIRE lol...they couldnt get to falklands if the americans didnt lend them airtankers  ffs...

 
if you think that politics is about short term issues and passions, and not longterm logical and benecifial plans than we have nothing to discuss.



edit:
BTW do u think that pools in 1950 showed that french and british wanted to be integrated in a union with germany? i think not but politicians were forced to invent something good to counter the soviet ideological enemies. and look where we live now...
europe is full of problems and i can imagine nationalistic sentiments being even bigger if there were no EU, because to start with, every country in europe claims some part of its neighbour...and thats just the first......

&gt;__Geoffroy's cat__ (*Leopardus geoffroyi*) is a wild [cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae) native to the southern and central regions of [South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America). It is about the size of a domestic cat. While the species is relatively common in many areas, it is considered to be [Near Threatened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Threatened) by IUCN because of concern over land-use changes in the regions where it lives.

The EC will not vote as they just make this treaty. The European Council has made the framework for the TTIP, and the EP will eventually vote for it, but a majority is almost a certainty as a majority is for the TTIP. It's only a question wether they will accept things like ACTA which was previously denied by the EP, but is now added again, and perhaps other parts. And wether the US would accept additional changes by the EP.

The EC is trying to defend itself by withholding the NP's from voting, those NP's are demanding they do hold a vote, and if they do not, the legal basis of the TTIP is doubtful at best. 


Trade agreements are an exclusive privilege of the EC, meaning they do not need NP's, but certain segments undermine current judicial and democratic institutions so much that it will probably not be accepted as such, or at least wobling along the border of legal rights, and certainly cross those of moral rights.

If it is put up for vote in the NP's, the chances of the TTIP making it are extremely slim. So the chances of the EC trying to avoid that ever so large.

RE: therapy lights: We're so far north here in Germany that during the winter, at its worst, the sun will come up between 8 and 8:30 in the morning and set between 3:30 and 4 p.m.  It can be a huge bummer.  A therapy light tricks your body into thinking that it gets more sunlight than it actually does and serves as a natural mood and energy booster.  This summer was really rainy and on the cold side (no joke, it was worse than a Sarasota winter), so it really helped to use the therapy light then, too.  I have this model: http://www.amazon.com/Philips-goLITE-BLU-Therapy-Device/dp/B001I45XL8  It comes with international adapters.  There are cheaper options, though, and there is an amazon.de, too.

ETA: Just saw your comment about a wool coat.  That will probably not be warm enough for you if you are coming from a warm climate.  Check out a web site like Campmor or REI and get something water-resistant, and get the warmest jacket you can afford.  It won't get, like, Minnesota cold here, but your opinion of what cold is is going to be different from almost everyone else's.  During the coldest part of winter (January-February), in bad years, I usually wear ski socks, long underwear under jeans or corduroys, and a long-sleeved t-shirt under a sweater.

It wasn't the bankers. Iceland's government deposit insurance was supposed to cover the deposits. So the bankers were not lying at the time. The government changed the law to only protect Icelandic citizens before it nationalized several banks. 

&gt;If they had payed like was almost done and the bank was really broke the Icelandic economy would have been completely crippled for decades to ensure stability of other nations economies.

Not saying there was a better way. The Icelandic government only had bad options. But it certainly knew of the potential unfunded liability it was creating, but continued to foster a favorable climate to attract deposits. I blame the Icelandic government/central bank just as much as the banks if not more. They seem to always be held up as heroes when they helped create the mess in the first place. This was not caused by complex derivatives traded behind closed doors, but rather, simple deposits. I have to assume the Icelandic government knew the risks and simply didn't care.

That's fine, and I apologize if I've misread you. Let's talk about what you'd like to suggest instead.

&gt; It might be a bit easier reasoning from the safety of Ireland (which could, next to Iceland, not be in a safer spot in Europe) but when you get further into the European mainland you will notice that people have more reservations towards such actions. 

Yes, what would a native of Northern Ireland, as opposed to a dutchman, know of conflict. Let's use *that* as an arguement. Let's bring my *ethnicity* into it.

&gt; To say that Donbass and Crimea are not Russian, is partially wrong by default. You cannot deny that the Donbass region as well as Crimea have a very large Russian presence among the populace, amounting to a majority in those regions (varying from 50 to 70 percent). 

Ukraine in general has cultural and historic ties to Russia, has many Russian citizens in it's borders and many Ukranians self-identify as Russia, just as the reverse is true to a lesser extent for Ukranians in Russia, or any neighbouring states anywhere. This isn't news to anybody and doesn't give a one state soveriengty over parts of another.

&gt; As a result you could say that it is Ukrainian by virtue of being recognized as Ukrainian soil  but by doing so you fail to appreciate the right of self determination of people. Wait! I can already hear you moving around your chair in disbelief, as we both know that the unrest in Donbass is very likely a coordinated effort instigated by Russia. 
&gt; That does not mean that people in eastern Ukraine were happy with the way Ukraine was before. Just take a look at the results of previous elections and you can see the massive divide that has characterised this country for a long time. It goes without saying that there never was 'one people' in Ukraine since 1991, and you should take this into account to some extent. Acknowledge, just like me, that Russia is stirring up things up in the Donbass region and beyond, but at the same time recognize that present day Ukraine is far from perfect. You could ask yourself if a federal state will ever get there with the current government.

Of course, every state on earth has divisions in it to greater or lesser extents. As a Northern Irishman I can assure you that outright violence solves nothing, nor does political repression. Both sides need to work at this *once the region has been stabilized.* The separatists, safe with the knowledge of Russian backing, will continue to fight indefinitely and have shown zero respect or intent to respect treaties or peaceful settlements. Let's make this very, very simple; both Donbas and Crimea are legally Ukranian and can only pass from Ukranian sovreignty through legal mechanisms. Questions of autonomy or separatism should be addressed legally.

&gt; I don't know if you are referring to me as a 'pro-putinist'

I am not?

&gt; Nothing is 'period' when it comes down to MAD: if one side feels threatened enough it could push the proverbial red button as a form of retaliation. It might not happen in the way of a global nuclear holocaust, but nuclear strikes might become an option if western nations start meddling in the Donbass region.

Oh please. That's not backed by any reality and is founded in  Cold War era propaganda as Russians as unknowable Others capable of any feat, even global nuclear war. No state will use nuclear deterrents because of MAD. It's *that* simple. 

Russia will *certainly* not escalate to nuclear warfare over an EU military in Ukraine's borders ending Ukranian rebellions. It's pandering to de-humanizing fear-mongering to believe they would.

&gt; Rationality and war are rarely reconciliable with one another. Especially now Putin got less to lose with each passing day, we should surely not provoke him. That is not cowardice, but wisdom. 

No, you are counselling this hand-in-hand with accepting the Ukranian loss of the entire Donbas and Crimean regions. That's appeasement. There's also a running theme of being terrified of Putin, which baffles me. He's not an inhuman monster, nor is the Russian military likely to invade Utrecht should you oppose rebels in Ukraine.

&gt; Don't corner a wild animal, because who knows what might happen. Above all: we should not take chances as you are proposing here and simply accept the risk that a nuke might hit Kiev. 

Okay you clearly have a very strange image of Putin in your mind that's colouring this entire arguement. Do you sincerely believe Putin would nuke Kiev and thus instigate war on a massive scale for the sake of *what you described* as a strip of soil? It's baffling one-way logic. He would perform these absurd actions but expect no retaliaton or the destruction of his army or people as a response for them? That's completely detached from reality, man. Calm yourself and think about this with a level-head.

&gt; This question isn't sound, as there will always be at least one party that loses during a dictatorship. If you are referring to 'peace and prosperity' for the appeasing countries, the answer would obviously be that it works from time to time, depending on the countries involved. It can even create strong economic ties, as we have seen with Libya, Saudi Arabia and Egypt for example,

This isn't answering the question against appeasement, because of course the answer is that it *never works.*

In a legal state, you have certain standards you have to satisfy, otherwise you're penalized. Most immigrants that come to Western Europe, come there from countries which aren't legal states. Those immigrants don't really understand the concept of the rule of law. They live in societies where you have to race with the state over whose going to screw over whom first — if you don't screw over the state, the state will screw you over.

You simply can't get rid of this mentality by lowering the standards the immigrants are expected to satisfy. It sends the wrong message. The message you should be sending is — things are done differently here, this is a state and society ruled by the law, everyone is equal before the law here and everyone has to satisfy the same standards. By being lenient as either the state or the society, you're teaching them that the same rules don't apply to everyone, that in this case the rules go to their advantage — from this they will draw the wrong conclusion. They will not say ""Hey, the state is trying to help me! I should respect this and pay the state back!"" The concept of state trying to help them is not very familiar to them. Instead, they'll conclude that it's much easier to screw over the Dutch state, than it is to screw over, say, Turkish state. Based on that conclusion, they'll function within the Dutch state.

On the other hand, there is not a single problem in society that can be solved by covering the problem up, or by censoring the discussion about such problem. What I gather from your reply is that there is no censorship, but rather a very strong self-censorship in the Dutch society regarding this problem, based on the idea of political correctness being more important than exercising free speech and conducting an open discussion on standing issues. This is very counter-productive.

I personally see political correctness as a significant threat to democracy. Not offending someone by forming opinions based on stereotypes and speaking with prejudice, has been perverted into not saying the truth which might offend someone. That is pure counterproductive, debilitating non-sense.

If the truth offends someone, either the truth, i.e. the current state of things, needs to be changed, or the offended individual needs to change.

&gt; Anyway: the fact that you imply that it is negative by default is - sorry to put it this way - a juvenile conclusion. I believe you are stuck with 'appeasement politics' in the back of your head, as those were used against Hitler before the start of WW2. It goes without saying that there are more examples out there, and the answer is not obvious. 

I'm tired of people using the comparison of Putin to Hitler *as a defence of Putin.* It's beyond bizarre - the reason the comparisons are made so frequently is because he has invited them with his actions, consistently over a prolonged period of time through internal policy, international diplomacy, militant expansion and beligerency. I remain waiting legitimately for you to provide an example that you say are out there of appeasement working in this scenario. I'll be surprised if you can find any.

&gt; It is worth less than peace. That is my damn point, not the warmongering you are bringing forward here.

**War is already upon them damn it. It doesn't stop being war because one side has said ""We haven't formally invaded, and if we did you'd know about it!""** Don't call me a damn warmonger when I'm advocating for an end to a hateful, bloody conflict that you would see prolonged so *your* conscience could stay clean!

&gt; You are one of those guys, forgive me for the ad hominem, that will set the world ablaze for his own selfish desires. 

Oh go to hell, will you? You start losing an arguement and you call me a warmonger and selfish? I'm advocating increased sanctions and military intervention at a sovereign states request for help to end an internal dispute financed by a malign foreign power. You offer nothing and decide to attack me personally, to make me into a supervillain so you can substantiate your own position? Grow the hell up, man. That's pathetic.

&gt; There is no point at all in starting a new global war

I'm tired of repeating to you know that there won't be a global war over this so this is the last time I'm going to bother saying it. It's absurd that you see this Red Menace at all.

&gt; Once again: if it were so easy, European soldiers would have landed in Ukraine a long time ago already

Don't kid yourself, the reason European soldiers haven't set foot in Ukraine is because of mixed interests with the member states and Russia and the fractured nature of the still-evolving EU, which this crisis will be a watershed moment in defining. We either look strong or weak coming out of it, we either maintain relations with a prospective member-state or cowtow to a beligerent regime. We don't need force to decide which path we take, but we will be judged and will judge ourselves by what happens.

&gt; Nothing is ridiculous in this scenario, especially when your opponent does not have much more to lose.

How are you still feeding this narrative? *He's the President of Russia,* he has an *enormous* amount to lose! Stop trying to fabricate this bizarre Hollywood villain and deal with the real people who are acting on the world stage!

&gt; Russia has been crippled economically and now you are challenging Putin for a fight. Of course he will accept the challenge, of course he will show the world that Russia is a 'proud' nation that will not back down. I don't know if you have actually watched Putin his comments over the past few months, or have any insight in his personality, but this man is clearly unpredictable and will do the unexpected thing. 

He hasn't deviated from his script since he took office, and definitely since this crisis begin. I'm not sure what you are watching or what your understanding of it is. He's a former Law school student and career politician. He's not fucking Megatron.

&gt; Bottom line: you downplay the risk of global war, I don't. I just look at history and know how close we were a few times before. There is no reason to look for the limit, nor to spill the blood of our soldiers in a counter-attack that might not even be supported by the local populace (in the Donbass and Crimea). 

I downplay it because it isn't a possibility, you overstate it because it's the defining feature of the arguement *which you still have to present.*  You honestly believe we are closer to nuclear war now than we were at the Cuban missile crisis because you've built the head of a much-reduced foe to be some sort of insane super-villain? It's not reality. You are deciding that Europe ends *here* and the EU has no influence *here* and that the lives of *these* Europeans are fine to spend but not *ours.* They're already dying to defend the borders of their country against a beligerent aggressor that's spending every bit of influence it can marshal to paint them as inhumans and Nazis and your concern is not for them, but for how well the rebels will view you.

&gt; Your absolutist statement that this is not based 'in reality' goes beyond understanding why we actually have peace nowadays. 

They don't have peace. Ask a Ukranian about this understanding. Tell them about how peace springs from the ground, magically, and is watered from the well of appeasement.

This has been going on for **nine bloody months.** Nine months of Ukranian deaths, Ukranian loss of infrastructure, Ukranian loss of capital, Ukranian loss of education, Ukranian loss of futures. It needs to end so the damn dying can stop and these people can rebuild their lives, whether we make the move through decisive sanctions or invited military intervention. Their crime was wanting to join the damn EU. Perhaps we should show ourselves worthy of the cost of their dead.

It's three years of pastiche that frankly, tries to prepare the student for everything but fails on many fronts. This causes the italian student to reach high school with a superficial and incomplete knowledge of what they're going to study, and it's reflected on the difficulties many have in the first years of high-school. I feel this and the constant inconclusive reforms are the main problem in italian education; however I'm not a pedagogist so I have no idea how middle school should be reformed in details, but the call to reform it has been surprisingly universal, so I hope eventually someone will get around it. However, this causes apathy and frustration in the teachers who feel like they are constricted in an everchanging apparatus of self-contradicting bureacracy.

I think the pessimism does have its roots in reality, but apart from middle school, the only true reform this country need would be a tweak of ministerial programs. Of course everyone has the recipe for the perfect program: personally I believe that economy and law should have at least two hours a week each, and philosophy should be present in elementary and middle school (but that's just a personal obsession of mine).

What Italy certainly lacks in comparison to other countries is materials, like computers, projectors, good desks and such, but that's not because of lack of legislation but rather lack of funds. I went to a really old public school in Florence, and while I was given A LOT of opportunities (frequent visits to La Scala theatre in Milan, archeology course with actual work in the field, school orchestra, additional language courses, gardening course, theatre course, student-run newspaper and so on) these were all self-financed and done with no outside help. But this is due to a conscious lack of funding, while the other problems arise from a systematic weakness of Italy's institutions.

Consequences of this is that besides the EC, all 28 member countries will need to ratify it (which usually means a majority in the lower and upper house).

CETA is ruled as being a mixed treaty, that's why it wasn't signed past september. 

CETA is now at the national parliaments, but some refused to sign yet. The Czechs demanded Canada would lift the visa requirement for them and they did, now Romania and Bulgaria also demand the Visa's to be lifted before they vote for it. 

TTIP is, as far as I know, not yet determined as mixed, but seeing as what happened to CETA (only after protest groups insisted) it is likely the same would happen to TTIP.

Nein, wie könnte man auch denken, dass sich die Wissenschaft dagegen ausspricht?

Herr Hornscheidt hat keine Ahnung wie sehr es manch einen Wissenschaftler bedrückt, dass sein Lehrstuhl gerade wieder Kürzungen hinnehmen musste während Shitscience wie Genderstudies an der selben Uni diese Fördermittel zugesprochen bekamen.

Es handelt sich hierbei um völlig unwissenschaftlichen Quatsch. So als ob sich jemand hinstellt und meint ""So, ab heute bin ich eine neue Spezies, ich möchte nun bitte als Exandoraner angesprochen werden. Dass ich biologisch ein Mensch bin ist mir egal. Einen Lehrstuhl für mich bitte, schließlich bin ich hier das Opfer!""

Es ist absolut unverständlich, dass solcher Humbug auch nur einen Cent an Fördergeldern bekommt. Es ist eine schallende Ohrfeige für jeden Akademiker, dass sowas wie Genderstudies an seiner Uni existiert. 

Es gibt dort auch keine Forschung die stattfindet. Es ist vielleicht Meinungsaustausch, aber nichts das verwertbare Ergebnisse produziert. Wo sind denn auch die Veröffentlichungen, die einer Kritik standhalten? Es gibt keine. Genderstudies haben seit ihrer Existenz nichts hervor gebracht, es gibt nichts aus diesem Bereich was die unzähligen Millionen die dort versenkt wurden rechtfertigen würden.

Aus genau diesem Grund wird das auch so gehasst. Es ist als ob irgendeine Meinung plötzlich ein akademisches Feld wäre, noch dazu mit dem Anspruch die Gesellschaft zu verändern, weil diese ja unterdrückend wäre, indem sie solch profanem Unsinn wie Biologie und anderen Wissenschaften folgen würde. 

Auch kann mir niemand erklären wozu dieser Genderwahn dient. Zyniker behaupten ja mittlerweile es gebe den nur als Beschäftigungstherapie für diejenigen Opfer, die sich so erfolgreich an die Unis lobbyierten. Wo auch hin mit Quotenfrauen die selbst für Geisteswissenschaften zu dumm sind, aber dennoch stets die Opferrolle ausschmücken? 
Na klar, die schickt man dann dort hin. 

Ich wünschte dieses Thema würde mich nicht ständig belästigen. Aber gerade Frauenbeauftragte haben oft Genderstudies als Beifach gehabt und begreifen selten, dass sie ihre Position wegen der Quote, nicht wegen ihren Fähigkeiten bekommen haben. 

Aber selbst in Briefen bekomme ich diesen Mist immer häufiger zu lesen, dabei verstößt eine gendergerechte Sprache gegen die Grundregeln der deutschen Sprache. Es ist wie alles was aus diesem Bereich kommt unlogisch, unwissenschaftlich und dient nur dazu der dem Genderwahn verfallenen Person ihr Leben angenehmer zu machen. Was Herr Hornscheidt nämlich nicht begreift, ist dass eine Anrede als Professor keine Diskriminierung beinhaltet. Beizugehen und zu behaupten dies sei aber eine, weil er das sagt, setzt dem ganzen die Krone auf.

Only the leaked stuff, which is far from the whole picture. If you read most of the articles on this sub they are almost all about what it might contain. Leaks show that the US is keeping financial services off the table until the EU strengthens regulations. It promised to do so in 2009 with a 2012 deadline. The new deadline is 2020. Many large US law firms are recommending clients list their complex derivatives in London over New York because of the more favorable regulatory climate. Obviously it is in the UK's interest to put off these reforms as long as possible, unless there is another crisis, but why bother looking that far into the future. (I am studying law with a focus on financial/international financial regulations, I also went to a derivatives law conference where speakers from many large firms were recommending listing in London at least until 2020, although they were skeptical the reforms would be passed by then). 

We also know through a leaked document the EU is pressuring the US to abandon the case-by-case approval process for energy exports to the EU. Aside from that, most negotiating is done in private. It still needs to be approved by the US Congress, the EU parliament, and the parliaments of the respective EU member states though. Aside from that, it will likely be fairly standard. Especially given the fact the US and Canadian economies are so strongly tied together, it will likely be similar to that deal (many US subsidiaries are operating in Canada and vise versa. So the Canadian deal gave some protections to US companies already). 

In fact, by being part of the EU, your country is already subject to over [1400 ISDS clauses](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/march/tradoc_152279.pdf) in various trade agreements. These include internal ones within the EU. In fact, European companies are the most prolific users of ISDS clauses, so it is not as if shark US companies would be attacking innocent Europe, as of now it is the other way around. The main function of an ISDS clause is to move the litigation from national courts to tribunals operated by the UN or World Bank. So instead of suing the UK in London, Fujitsu would have filed suit in a court system that is not affiliated with the British government to ensure fairness (even though they ultimately won in the British court system). In many ways, that is the largest protection, because other forms of law can offer similar protections. Again, we can look at the NHS case that was decided on contract law grounds and was not filed under an ISDS clause (despite how many times it is posted on this sub as an example of what happens when you have them).

The ""meistens"" implies this.

""Das Abitur"" is usually used to refer to the final exam (the Abiturprüfung) or the degree you have after graduating from a Gymnasium (as in ""Ich hab' Abitur""). I'm pretty sure that there is no universal term for the last two years, it can be called something like ""Oberstufe"", ""Kursstufe"" etc..

Yes, one of its meanings is ""however"", but you can't use it in every case you would use ""however"" in English.

It's hard to answer your question without knowing more about you, what you like, etc. 

Some ideas:

- make an effort to make friends. it's easier when you have people to meet with, do things with, talk with. Where to meet people? Meetup.com events, OnVaSortir, expat groups, etc. etc. I think this is the best thing you can do to help yourself.

- go outside of the city on the weekends. where you go depends on what you like... go to other cities on the train (Brussels, Amsterdam, Strasbourg, Lyon, there are many possibilities that are easy on the train and you can do for a weekend).  Or go to the countryside, go visit cute french towns, go for hikes (there are books with hikes you can do from one train station to another), check out farmer's markets, enjoy green places and forest.

- create projects for yourself. What this is depends on what you're interested in. Dive into the history of Paris and the oldest buildings; get into street art &amp; go find and photograph it; find out about the many tiny museums (Musées Insolites) and go visit them all one by one; learn about French wine and cooking; etc. etc.

Non esattamente, secondo me non è tutto relativo e il metro di giudizio è la parola di dio.

aborto, eutanasia, sesso prematrimoniale? chiesa mafiosa?
parliamone se vuoi.

&gt;Non ho bisogno di un Dio che mi dica d'aver fatto la cosa giusta per sentirmi bene quando aiuto qualcuno

a dio non gliene frega niente che tu faccia la ""cosa giusta"", a dio gli interessa che tu sia contenta della tua vita, e Gesù ci ha detto in persona che il modo vero di essere felici è rendere felici gli altri.
Puoi anche fare la ""cosa sbagliata"" l'importante è accorgersene, non credo proprio che dio voglia i soldatini tipo Opus Dei, dato che Gesù era un palestinese che si accompagnava a pescatori, scaricatori di porto, prostitute, malati, ciechi, poveri etc. 

&gt;Credi sia possibile tramandare i tuoi valori al di fuori della religione?

Bellissima domanda.Serve un libro. Sì e no, credo di poter farmi capire da chi non crede. Non credo che ""evangelizzare"" significhi ""convertire"", credo che il mio compito come cristiano è quello di CERCARE di vivere in mezzo agli altri alla *Sua* maniera e di magari mettere un seme di buona speranza negli altri che, ripeto, non significa convertire, non voglio convertire nessuno, voglio persone che sappiano fare scelte e che siano consapevoli di quello che fanno, anche le stronzate.
Essere brave persone e bravi cittadini è un obiettivo alla portata di tutti.

Vergintà Madonna non saprei, è un dogma che non ha basi razionali, me lo spiego come una storia per mettere più enfasi sulla divinità di gesù che sull'umanità. 
Sui miracoli scetticissimo, su alcuni credo proprio che si tratti di truffa, tipo certi pellegrinaggi...

nota a margine: non è che uno crede e poi finisce così, tipo il livello di un gioco. Io ho dei dubbi che mi arrovellano tutti i giorni, ci sono giorni che maledirei dio per tutte le cazzate che faccio, ci sono volte che lo rinnego (cfr.

false,votapmen,SRPS,Република Српска — Republika Srpska,"&gt;universal wrongs or rights though.

I agree with what you perceive as right and wrong, but I wouldn't call them universal. That is dogmatic thinking. We're now going off into philosophy and religion — if there's is God (in the absolutely broadest sense of the word), there may as well be universal rights or wrongs. But we cannot objectively know whether that's true, at least not at this time. That should be the starting point.

&gt;Child abuse, murder, these are some things that shouldn't be tolerated in any culture.

Well, I do believe they *shouldn't* be. But I don't believe those are universal ""laws"". They all stem from some final goal we all share, which differs from culture to culture. You and I believe that child abuse is wrong because we believe physical violence is wrong. That is also a cultural view. We believe physical violence is wrong, because we believe no one has the authority, the right to violate other person's bodily sovereignty. We believe *that*, because we believe there are no universally objective ""rights"" and ""wrongs"" and thus every person should follow it's own path in life without others physically imposing on them, and them physically imposing on others in the name of those ""rights"" and ""wrongs"".

We believe child abuse is wrong for other reasons, too — we believe innocent and weak should be protected and treated with highest care because they are our biggest treasure. What kind of a civilization are we if we abuse the unprotected, what kind of values do we cherish then? If the weakest aren't protected, then no one is protected, and the society collapses into chaos. But, again, this is a cultural view. You and me agree on this, because we believe society *shouldn't* collapse. We believe society shouldn't collapse, because we believe in sanctity of life and humanity. Because we want humanity to survive. We believe humanity needs to survive. Etc. (This might seem as an oversimplification, but I think it's a decent illustration.)

But what if someone believes that society should collapse? What if someone doesn't believe in sanctity of life? What if someone believes we shouldn't exists?

Can you claim that their belief is wrong? On what grounds can you claim that someone who believes society should collapse is objectively wrong and your belief is objectively right?

There are a few way to approach these disagreements: you can try to find the root of the disagreement (in this hypothetical it would be disagreement over sanctity of life) and try to persuade the other person into agreeing with you; if he refuses to discuss it, you can say fine, here's the border of my country, within it you respect our laws and our culture — if you break them you go to jail, but you're still free to hold your beliefs; if you attack my borders, my country will attack you. And that's pretty much it.

But you also should be open-minded and accept possibility that it is in fact you who is ""wrong"".

But outright labeling someone's beliefs as objectively ""wrong"" or them being a nutjob, and then leaving it at that is counterproductive and it could even radicalize them furthermore by inducing in them a victim complex or persecutory delusion.",0,1416257074,null,0,1416257312,0,cm5angf,t3_2md19u,t1_cm5angf,t1_cm59tvl,null,1425978378,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

This is what I would say. Anytime you move to a new city (unless you have moved so many times that you are used to it), its hard. Then you hit a slump where it is really hard. It clears up around the 6 month mark (I have lived in 8 different cities long enough to go through this process). And you know what? Once you have that subway pass, you won't have to do it again. Once you have your carte vitale, you won't have to do it again. Those sorts of things all just sort of dissappear. And really. Once you understand the cultural logic of the place, you'll just understand how to do things. 

Wait why is buying things online hard? Haven't had that issue..... And what arrondisement are you in if you feel unsafe? Paris feels pretty safe to me, in all honesty. 

Yes, its an expensive city. But New York and San Francisco and London are crazy expensive too. And if you have a job that brought you to the city, hopefully you're getting paid for that job.... 

I agree with the comment that you should be making friends and doing things that you like to do. People love Paris (and other cities like it) because there is everything and anything to do just about at any given moment. Use the internet to find those fun things.... FB events and google are your friends...... 

And as far as stores closing early or on Sundays? Learn to think about what you want to eat the next day at 5pm. Stores in my neighborhood close at 21h of 22h so that's ample time to pick things up..... But, if you work on being just overall more comfortable, that type of annoyance won't even bother you so much any more..... 

Good luck. You're at the point in your move where you hate everything just because you hate it because its not the same as where you were before. Make some friends, refind your hobbies, chill out a little bit, and you will be comfortable again three months from now. :) ",0,1416257290,null,0,false,0,cm5arri,t3_2mlbmt,t1_cm5arri,t3_2mlbmt,null,1425978321,36,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,36

As a result there is no ""US"" ethnicity (yet). But you probably do consider your identity to have a certain more or less evident distinction from someone who is from Mexico or someone who is from Argentina.

It's not even that simple.  Someone living in Mission, TX will have an experience more consistent with a Mexican person than someone living in Milwaukee, WI.  And someone living in Buffalo, NY will have an experience more consistent with Canadians than someone living in New Orleans.  further away from a single defined group.  Especially since most new immigration isn't from Europe but from Latin America and Asia.  We're gradually turning into a mish mash of every group on Earth.  Which I don't consider a bad thing.  I believe that our relative peacefulness over the past 150 years comes partially from not feeling strongly about an attachment to your local group.  I mean, not having a community isn't great but there are some good side effects.

And we don't really divide on Polish American or French American or any of that crap anymore.  I mean, some people do but they're largely just blowing smoke.  Most white people in the US are a mix of so many ""ethnicities"" anymore that they can't be tied to any European country.  For instance, my surname is English in origin, my middle name and matrilineal family name is German in origin, my mother's grandmother immigrated from Sweden, and I have dozens of other family members that came from lord only knows where.  I'm married to a woman who's surname is Danish but her father's mother is Scottish.  Her mom's father's side is (as best we can tell) English and her mom's mother's side has been in the US since before the revolution.  We're both mutts to the extent that giving either of us an ethnicity is a slap in the face to other members of that ethnicity.  And it's not like any of them see Americans as part of their group anyway.  Good luck trying to tell some German or Irish people that you're German or Irish in ethnicity.

Subway passes in other cities are just buy the card and charge it up. In Paris it seems to be a 4-step process involving proof of identity and sending things to your house and taking weeks. The whole thing is so overly complex and representative of French bureaucracy.. anyway.

Buying stuff online is hard because delivery is unreliable, and you can't choose delivery times, and redelivery is a mess, and you can't go pick it up.

I feel unsafe in a bunch of places when it's dark and there are people hanging around.

I am getting paid but 20 euros for a meal out seems ridiculous. I've lived in Tokyo and there it's less than 10 euros for a really good meal (much better than here).

Yeah stores closing (not just food places) means it's impossible to do shopping during the week for me, other than a quick food shop. So my Saturdays are killed. I guess it requires more planning. I'm used to 24h convenience stores and clothes shops open until 10pm.

I think you're right. I do hate it because it's not what I'm used to. I keep comparing everything to where I was last (Tokyo), and it's just shit. I hope you're right about things getting better.

false,zakool21,null,null,"&gt; It's incredibly dirty

Is this your first time living in a city? Most major cities are bound to be described by someone as dirty unless you're in Singapore or Geneva. 

&gt; the weather sucks

Lots of overcast, yes. Not a big surprise. I was there for 8 months and saw a total of 3 weeks of sunshine (fall 2011 - spring 2012). Still lots to do.

&gt; the food is bland and overpriced

Look around more. There is plenty of inexpensive food as long as you're not expecting American portion sizes. Cook your own food, groceries are relatively inexpensive there. 

&gt; the subway is a mess

One of the best in the world. They're always doing more to improve it (like adding barriers to prevent suicides and their resulting delays). I could always make it somewhere in less than two transfers... and in good time! What are you comparing it to? BART in the SF Bay Area is worse than their RER, their Métro is better than MUNI. If you want to compare it tit for tat, compare it to the NY Subway. Still not very clean, kind of sketchy people at times. Still gets you around better than anything else.

&gt; shops close super early

It's not American 24/7 style. People value their time off. Prepare for when you want to shop and it's a lot easier. 

&gt; people don't do their jobs properly, bureaucracy is a nightmare

Please elaborate. Bureaucracy is shitty there, but I bet you're exposed to a lot more of it there than you were at home since you're probably dealing with visa requirements, medical visits, and things you don't do as often at home. Reality check: bureaucracy sucks everywhere. 

&gt; it's dangerous at night

Depends entirely on the neighborhood. I wouldn't be hanging out in the 18th or 19th at night, alone, but almost everywhere else within the périphérique I found safe enough.

&gt; apartments are run-down and insanely expensive

Old, aged, not always modern, yes. And yes, they're pretty expensive, but again, reality check: big cities everywhere have very expensive rent for what you get size- and quality-wise.

&gt; everything is inconvenient from buying things online to getting a subway pass.

Last I checked if you wanted to get a voyageur pass for the métro you could buy one from any staffed booth for five Euros. If you want to register it and have it replaceable if lost, then you have to fill out some paperwork and wait in line at one of the big train stations. I never had trouble buying anything online. I was even able to get a same-day delivery from Amazon. 

&gt; what am I doing wrong? 

More likely than not you're comparing apples to oranges. 

&gt; What is the wonderful appeal of Paris?

The food, the nightlife, the walkability, everyone's active lifestyle, peoples' willingness to enjoy themselves, the art, the museums, the tiny hidden niches that are everywhere in the city, the vibrancy, I could go on....

&gt; I'm going to be living here for another 6 months (possibly a year or so), what can I do? :S

Go meet some people to explore the city with. It takes some in-depth exploration to really get the most out of the city, and if you're not versed on that type of travel, don't be afraid to ask someone to help you delve in. Go read A Moveable Feast by Hemingway. Many of the referenced places in the city are still there to go visit. 

Sorry for my long post. I've lived in Paris, visited a half-dozen times otherwise, and it will never fail to be my favorite city in the world -- and I've been to a number of really wonderful cities, Francophone or not (Montreal, NYC, Shanghai, Seoul, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, London, Istanbul, the list goes on...).",0,1416259259,null,0,false,0,cm5bw1q,t3_2mlbmt,t1_cm5bw1q,t3_2mlbmt,null,1425977799,21,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,21

You know you can have things delivered to the post office right? Have ""Poste Restante"" written on it, and the address of the post office, and you can pick it up there. Pretty easy. If ordering from Amazon, use relais colis locations. 

The good thing about any major city is that you can build multiple things into your commute. You can likely pick things up on your way to or from work. That sort of thing maximizes your time by a lot. And you probably have a lunch break that is an hour. You could certainly get some things done in that time. And that French work ethic you are complaining about? See what happens if you tell your boss you have to go to the doctor or do some thing during work hours. I'm pretty sure the boss will be just fine with it. 

Also remember that food is just taste. You want exactly what you had in Tokyo. You're not going to get it, because you are not in Tokyo. So you might as well stop throwing a fit when you don't get it. throwing a fit consumes a lot of energy. You could learn to cook for yourself, or find out what you do like in Paris. Saying that there is nothing good to eat in all of Paris is just silly. Really. Its silly. As far as price - that is also cultural and space dependent. Clothes are more expensive here too. Doesn't mean it has to ruin my life, I can figure out what my best options are, and then move on.....  

Looking through other comments on the thread, it seems that Parisian aesthetic just isn't your thing. And that's really fine - but I think that changing your outlook and socializing is the only way that you will manage to make yourself comfortable for the time that you are here.

I lived in Tokyo before coming here, so the dirt here really shocked me.

I'm generally comparing it to the subways in Tokyo. Maybe that's not fair. In Tokyo the trains were faster, cleaner, cheaper, on-time (despite frequent suicides), air-conditioned, with phone signal.

For the bureaucracy the main thing that annoyed me is people didn't make any effort to explain the hoops you have to jump through. In Japan there's a similar amount of paperwork, but they explain what you have to do, and push you through the system. In Paris I explained that I had just arrived, and that I had heard I needed X,Y,Z, and could they help me, and they just stared at me and asked ""Well what do you think you need?"" The idea of doing their job and proactively helping someone seemed totally inconceivable.
The same attitude extends to people doing their jobs in other places too. Their mindset isn't ""How can I help you?"" but ""Why should I bother helping you?""

My annoyance with bureaucracy doesn't end there though. Getting an apartment is a 10-step process, getting a bank account took 3 weeks when I made one in 30 minutes in Japan. And every step was like getting blood from a stone.

I'm definitely comparing it with Tokyo, it's true. The food was better there, the nightlife I don't really do, walkability is better in Japan because the streets aren't covered in trash, as for the other stuff I guess I'm not so interested in art or museums.

Depends on the type of card you're getting-- this is true of the Imagine R, but for the standard monthly Navigo, you can complete the process the day of.  And I think it's worth it given how much cheaper the Imagine R is :)  Personally the only thing I dislike about the metro is how early it closes, but otherwise I think it's fantastic.

Safety is probably weird for you given that you come from Tokyo, which I understand is one of the safest cities in the world.

And if they don't have many issues I get turned off by the kinds of policy they stand for and the people there want.

The Nordic ones seem like a great choice. But then I look at Sweden's immigration policy and their political correctness agenda and I'm just turned off by the whole thing. Also there are a large number of immigrants from my country there anyway so I don't want to really be there because sizable immigration numbers usually cause a lot more crime per capita than the population.

Iceland was my #1 country to try to go to once the Russians invade my country, but recent news about what's going on there have stricken that off the list too.

The UK has their obvious spying problem that they don't even seem to try to hide anymore. I mean sure, every country has a bit of it, but the UK seems to have a lot more of it on top of having the attitude of ""Yeah, we are spying on you. What are you gonna do about it?!""

Ireland is a bit too close to the UK for my liking and I'm afraid a lot of the policies work the same way there. I also think Ireland is going to have a lot of trouble in the future since the EU wants to smother tax incentives for companies.

Germany seems too ""hard-working"", I don't like the language (even though I'm essentially fluent in it) and some of their laws seem nuts. Remember the fact that you couldn't show blood in video games in Germany? How the hell does something like that ever pass?

France seems to riot all the time. I don't like the language of France either, but other than that I don't have many complaints.

Ok, te ne faccio un altra: è qualcosa che faccio fatica a comprendere. Riguarda la dottrina della predestinazione, ed il paradosso del libero arbitrio. 

Ovvero il fatto che dio abbia pre-conoscenza di ogni cosa. Compresa la salvazione o meno di ogni singola persona. Mi ha colpito molto quando l'ho scoperta, e mi sembra pure sensata. 

Ma a quel punto non mi sembra più sensata l'idea stessa di dio, o meglio, non mi sembra sensata l'esistenza dell'uomo, nei piani di dio.
La visione della chiesa (cattolica) non mi convince del tutto: chi è eletto ad ottenere la vita eterna la avrà, chi invece non è compreso NON subirà la dannazione eterna. Semplicemente scomparirà? Allora che senso ha avuto la sua esistenza? 

Edit: questo discorso ha senso se si accettano i presupposti classici, onniscenza, benevolenza e onnipotenza. Per quanto ne so, dio  potrebbe esistere ma non essere onniscente.

Here in Germany, one of the first things that happened when the Greens came to power was that they tried to completely defund all fusion research as ""Schrotttechnologie"".

I am not kidding.

Fortunately, the research commitments had been made before so that most fusion research survived (including the group where I did my Masters Thesis), but that little shock has made me somewhat thin-skinned regarding the ""no future"" argument.

I read in one of your other posts that you advocate phasing out coal first, then nuclear. Going from that, I'd say our opinions are mostly similar.

EDIT: Oh, regarding the technicalities: Nuclear fusion uses the same interaction processes as nuclear fission. The only difference is that it operates with elements/isotopes where you gain energy by merging them into a bigger nucleus, instead of gaining energy by smashing them appart. 

Fusion reactions are on average less ""dirty"", but still produce radioactive debris and activate the machinery. The ""radioactive garbage"" is a lot easier to handle, since it doesn't contain isotopes with a long half-life.

That, unfortunately, is not sufficient to convince the German mainstream anti-nuclear advocate of anything. It seems, they regard it as more of the same.",0,1416261987,null,0,1416262413,0,cm5dez4,t3_2mjjs6,t1_cm5dez4,t1_cm59eg5,null,1425977017,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

These are the things that we are asked to believe by the lazy dumb media:

* That the best way to prevent oligarchs from looting your country is to make one of them president and appoint others as provincial governors.

* That the only way to transcend Ukraine’s political failures is to appoint a bunch of people who have been in and out of governments for years.

* That an election that excludes the parties that got 40%+ the last time around is perfectly democratic.

* That the shoot-down of MH17 is an enormously important story until it suddenly isn’t.

* That the rebels would shoot down an aircraft flying at 10000 metres heading towards Russia in a straight line.

* That the Putin who is so determined to re-establish the Empire forgot to grab Georgia in 2008.

* That people haven’t noticed that it’s NATO that’s getting closer to Russia and not the other way around.

* That NATO gets its intelligence from tweets, twitters and blurry commercial satellite images.

* That postponing implementation of the Ukraine-EU agreement is unacceptable right up to the moment that it is postponed.

* That the fact that Ukraine owes Russia billions for gas it has consumed is evidence of Russian pressure on Ukraine.

* That Russia is always invading but never actually invades.

* That all those swastikas and neo-nazi references are just a figment of Putin’s imagination.

* That artillery shells keep falling on civilians in eastern Ukraine but nobody knows where they come from.

* That self-determination is perfectly acceptable in Kosovo but absolutely unacceptable in Ukraine.

* That Nuland and Pyatt didn’t actually plan out the new government.

Wool coats aren't really meant for weather below the 40s or 50s anyway and snow melts with your body heat.  If you go out in the rain or in the snow with a wool coat, especially a cheap one, it can just soak up liquid.  Water-resistant is the way to go.

This August was colder than usual and it was in the high 40s/ low 50s. Two or three years ago, it was over 100 degrees in July, so the weather can be really unpredictable.  If you need cheap winter clothing, look on Black Friday, or go shopping at C&amp;A or H&amp;M after you get here.

Your assistant ""challenged"" you, and that's the right word. She knows you basically have a snowball's chance in hell of understanding a single word. Don't worry: this is being very deliberately spoken in a strong dialect, only a few people speak like that normally.

I won't translate or transcribe it for you -- I'd be here all night doing that -- but the recording begins with the author saying the title of the piece, which is in the video title. It is:

""Es gibt guadte und bese Geatna: des is es Liad fon an besn.""

I can translate that into standard German for you:

""Es gibt gute und böse Gärtner: das ist das Lied von einem bösen.""

Notice how some of the long vowels are pronounced as diphthongs (two vowels one after the other): the ""u"" in ""gute"" is pronounced ""u-a"", the ""ie"" in ""Lied"" is pronounced ""i-a"".

**The Return of Geopolitics: The Revengs of the Revisionist Powers** 

*Foreign Affairs*, May/June 2014

&gt;So far, the year 2014 has been a tumultuous one, as geopolitical rivalries have stormed back to center stage. Whether it is Russian forces seizing Crimea, China making aggressive claims in its coastal waters, Japan responding with an increasingly assertive strategy of its own, or Iran trying to use its alliances with Syria and Hezbollah to dominate the Middle East, old-fashioned power plays are back in international relations.

&gt;The United States and the EU, at least, find such trends disturbing. Both would rather move past geopolitical questions of territory and military power and focus instead on ones of world order and global governance: trade liberalization, nuclear nonproliferation, human rights, the rule of law, climate change, and so on. Indeed, since the end of the Cold War, the most important objective of U.S. and EU foreign policy has been to shift international relations away from zero-sum issues toward win-win ones. To be dragged back into old-school contests such as that in Ukraine doesn’t just divert time and energy away from those important questions; it also changes the character of international politics. As the atmosphere turns dark, the task of promoting and maintaining world order grows more daunting.

&gt;But Westerners should never have expected old-fashioned geopolitics to go away. They did so only because they fundamentally misread what the collapse of the Soviet Union meant: the ideological triumph of liberal capitalist democracy over communism, not the obsolescence of hard power. China, Iran, and Russia never bought into the geopolitical settlement that followed the Cold War, and they are making increasingly forceful attempts to overturn it. That process will not be peaceful, and whether or not the revisionists succeed, their efforts have already shaken the balance of power and changed the dynamics of international politics.

&gt;A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY

&gt;When the Cold War ended, the most vexing geopolitical questions seemed largely settled.
When the Cold War ended, many Americans and Europeans seemed to think that the most vexing geopolitical questions had largely been settled. With the exception of a handful of relatively minor problems, such as the woes of the former Yugoslavia and the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, the biggest issues in world politics, they assumed, would no longer concern boundaries, military bases, national self-determination, or spheres of influence.

&gt;One can’t blame people for hoping. The West’s approach to the realities of the post–Cold War world has made a great deal of sense, and it is hard to see how world peace can ever be achieved without replacing geopolitical competition with the construction of a liberal world order. Still, Westerners often forget that this project rests on the particular geopolitical foundations laid in the early 1990s.

&gt;In Europe, the post–Cold War settlement involved the unification of Germany, the dismemberment of the Soviet Union, and the integration of the former Warsaw Pact states and the Baltic republics into NATO and the EU. In the Middle East, it entailed the dominance of Sunni powers that were allied with the United States (Saudi Arabia, its Gulf allies, Egypt, and Turkey) and the double containment of Iran and Iraq. In Asia, it meant the uncontested dominance of the United States, embedded in a series of security relationships with Japan, South Korea, Australia, Indonesia, and other allies.

&gt;This settlement reflected the power realities of the day, and it was only as stable as the relationships that held it up. Unfortunately, many observers conflated the temporary geopolitical conditions of the post–Cold War world with the presumably more final outcome of the ideological struggle between liberal democracy and Soviet communism. The political scientist Francis Fukuyama’s famous formulation that the end of the Cold War meant “the end of history” was a statement about ideology. But for many people, the collapse of the Soviet Union didn’t just mean that humanity’s ideological struggle was over for good; they thought geopolitics itself had also come to a permanent end.

&gt;At first glance, this conclusion looks like an extrapolation of Fukuyama’s argument rather than a distortion of it. After all, the idea of the end of history has rested on the geopolitical consequences of ideological struggles ever since the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel first expressed it at the beginning of the nineteenth century. For Hegel, it was the Battle of Jena, in 1806, that rang the curtain down on the war of ideas. In Hegel’s eyes, Napoleon Bonaparte’s utter destruction of the Prussian army in that brief campaign represented the triumph of the French Revolution over the best army that prerevolutionary Europe could produce. This spelled an end to history, Hegel argued, because in the future, only states that adopted the principles and techniques of revolutionary France would be able to compete and survive.

&gt;Adapted to the post–Cold War world, this argument was taken to mean that in the future, states would have to adopt the principles of liberal capitalism to keep up. Closed, communist societies, such as the Soviet Union, had shown themselves to be too uncreative and unproductive to compete economically and militarily with liberal states. Their political regimes were also shaky, since no social form other than liberal democracy provided enough freedom and dignity for a contemporary society to remain stable.

&gt;To fight the West successfully, you would have to become like the West, and if that happened, you would become the kind of wishy-washy, pacifistic milquetoast society that didn’t want to fight about anything at all. The only remaining dangers to world peace would come from rogue states such as North Korea, and although such countries might have the will to challenge the West, they would be too crippled by their obsolete political and social structures to rise above the nuisance level (unless they developed nuclear weapons, of course). And thus former communist states, such as Russia, faced a choice. They could jump on the modernization bandwagon and become liberal, open, and pacifistic, or they could cling bitterly to their guns and their culture as the world passed them by.

&gt;At first, it all seemed to work. With history over, the focus shifted from geopolitics to development economics and nonproliferation, and the bulk of foreign policy came to center on questions such as climate change and trade. The conflation of the end of geopolitics and the end of history offered an especially enticing prospect to the United States: the idea that the country could start putting less into the international system and taking out more. It could shrink its defense spending, cut the State Department’s appropriations, lower its profile in foreign hotspots -- and the world would just go on becoming more prosperous and more free.

&gt;This vision appealed to both liberals and conservatives in the United States. The administration of President Bill Clinton, for example, cut both the Defense Department’s and the State Department’s budgets and was barely able to persuade Congress to keep paying U.S. dues to the UN. At the same time, policymakers assumed that the international system would become stronger and wider-reaching while continuing to be conducive to U.S. interests. Republican neo-isolationists, such as former Representative Ron Paul of Texas, argued that given the absence of serious geopolitical challenges, the United States could dramatically cut both military spending and foreign aid while continuing to benefit from the global economic system.

&gt;After 9/11, President George W. Bush based his foreign policy on the belief that Middle Eastern terrorists constituted a uniquely dangerous opponent, and he launched what he said would be a long war against them. In some respects, it appeared that the world was back in the realm of history. But the Bush administration’s belief that democracy could be implanted quickly in the Arab Middle East, starting with Iraq, testified to a deep conviction that the overall tide of events was running in America’s favor.

&gt;In very different ways, China, Iran, and Russia are all seeking to revise the status quo.
&gt;President Barack Obama built his foreign policy on the conviction that the “war on terror” was overblown, that history really was over, and that, as in the Clinton years, the United States’ most important priorities involved promoting the liberal world order, not playing classical geopolitics. The administration articulated an extremely ambitious agenda in support of that order: blocking Iran’s drive for nuclear weapons, solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, negotiating a global climate change treaty, striking Pacific and Atlantic trade deals, signing arms control treaties with Russia, repairing U.S. relations with the Muslim world, promoting gay rights, restoring trust with European allies, and ending the war in Afghanistan. At the same time, however, Obama planned to cut defense spending dramatically and reduced U.S. engagement in key world theaters, such as Europe and the Middle East.

false,TelevisionAntichrist,UNSA,Bad since 1776,"&gt;AN AXIS OF WEEVILS?

&gt;All these happy convictions are about to be tested. Twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, whether one focuses on the rivalry between the EU and Russia over Ukraine, which led Moscow to seize Crimea; the intensifying competition between China and Japan in East Asia; or the subsuming of sectarian conflict into international rivalries and civil wars in the Middle East, the world is looking less post-historical by the day. In very different ways, with very different objectives, China, Iran, and Russia are all pushing back against the political settlement of the Cold War.

&gt;The relationships among those three revisionist powers are complex. In the long run, Russia fears the rise of China. Tehran’s worldview has little in common with that of either Beijing or Moscow. Iran and Russia are oil-exporting countries and like the price of oil to be high; China is a net consumer and wants prices low. Political instability in the Middle East can work to Iran’s and Russia’s advantage but poses large risks for China. One should not speak of a strategic alliance among them, and over time, particularly if they succeed in undermining U.S. influence in Eurasia, the tensions among them are more likely to grow than shrink.

&gt;What binds these powers together, however, is their agreement that the status quo must be revised. Russia wants to reassemble as much of the Soviet Union as it can. China has no intention of contenting itself with a secondary role in global affairs, nor will it accept the current degree of U.S. influence in Asia and the territorial status quo there. Iran wishes to replace the current order in the Middle East -- led by Saudi Arabia and dominated by Sunni Arab states -- with one centered on Tehran.

&gt;Leaders in all three countries also agree that U.S. power is the chief obstacle to achieving their revisionist goals. Their hostility toward Washington and its order is both offensive and defensive: not only do they hope that the decline of U.S. power will make it easier to reorder their regions, but they also worry that Washington might try to overthrow them should discord within their countries grow. Yet the revisionists want to avoid direct confrontations with the United States, except in rare circumstances when the odds are strongly in their favor (as in Russia’s 2008 invasion of Georgia and its occupation and annexation of Crimea this year). Rather than challenge the status quo head on, they seek to chip away at the norms and relationships that sustain it.

&gt;Since Obama has been president, each of these powers has pursued a distinct strategy in light of its own strengths and weaknesses. China, which has the greatest capabilities of the three, has paradoxically been the most frustrated. Its efforts to assert itself in its region have only tightened the links between the United States and its Asian allies and intensified nationalism in Japan. As Beijing’s capabilities grow, so will its sense of frustration. China’s surge in power will be matched by a surge in Japan’s resolve, and tensions in Asia will be more likely to spill over into global economics and politics.

&gt;Iran, by many measures the weakest of the three states, has had the most successful record. The combination of the United States’ invasion of Iraq and then its premature withdrawal has enabled Tehran to cement deep and enduring ties with significant power centers across the Iraqi border, a development that has changed both the sectarian and the political balance of power in the region. In Syria, Iran, with the help of its longtime ally Hezbollah, has been able to reverse the military tide and prop up the government of Bashar al-Assad in the face of strong opposition from the U.S. government. This triumph of realpolitik has added considerably to Iran’s power and prestige. Across the region, the Arab Spring has weakened Sunni regimes, further tilting the balance in Iran’s favor. So has the growing split among Sunni governments over what to do about the Muslim Brotherhood and its offshoots and adherents.

&gt;Russia, meanwhile, has emerged as the middling revisionist: more powerful than Iran but weaker than China, more successful than China at geopolitics but less successful than Iran. Russia has been moderately effective at driving wedges between Germany and the United States, but Russian President Vladimir Putin’s preoccupation with rebuilding the Soviet Union has been hobbled by the sharp limits of his country’s economic power. To build a real Eurasian bloc, as Putin dreams of doing, Russia would have to underwrite the bills of the former Soviet republics -- something it cannot afford to do.

&gt;Nevertheless, Putin, despite his weak hand, has been remarkably successful at frustrating Western projects on former Soviet territory. He has stopped NATO expansion dead in its tracks. He has dismembered Georgia, brought Armenia into his orbit, tightened his hold on Crimea, and, with his Ukrainian adventure, dealt the West an unpleasant and humiliating surprise. From the Western point of view, Putin appears to be condemning his country to an ever-darker future of poverty and marginalization. But Putin doesn’t believe that history has ended, and from his perspective, he has solidified his power at home and reminded hostile foreign powers that the Russian bear still has sharp claws.

&gt;Obama now finds himself bogged down in exactly the kinds of geopolitical rivalries he had hoped to transcend.

&gt;THE POWERS THAT BE

&gt;The revisionist powers have such varied agendas and capabilities that none can provide the kind of systematic and global opposition that the Soviet Union did. As a result, Americans have been slow to realize that these states have undermined the Eurasian geopolitical order in ways that complicate U.S. and European efforts to construct a post-historical, win-win world.

&gt;Still, one can see the effects of this revisionist activity in many places. In East Asia, China’s increasingly assertive stance has yet to yield much concrete geopolitical progress, but it has fundamentally altered the political dynamic in the region with the fastest-growing economies on earth. Asian politics today revolve around national rivalries, conflicting territorial claims, naval buildups, and similar historical issues. The nationalist revival in Japan, a direct response to China’s agenda, has set up a process in which rising nationalism in one country feeds off the same in the other. China and Japan are escalating their rhetoric, increasing their military budgets, starting bilateral crises with greater frequency, and fixating more and more on zero-sum competition.

&gt;Although the EU remains in a post-historical moment, the non-EU republics of the former Soviet Union are living in a very different age. In the last few years, hopes of transforming the former Soviet Union into a post-historical region have faded. The Russian occupation of Ukraine is only the latest in a series of steps that have turned eastern Europe into a zone of sharp geopolitical conflict and made stable and effective democratic governance impossible outside the Baltic states and Poland.

&gt;In the Middle East, the situation is even more acute. Dreams that the Arab world was approaching a democratic tipping point -- dreams that informed U.S. policy under both the Bush and the Obama administrations -- have faded. Rather than building a liberal order in the region, U.S. policymakers are grappling with the unraveling of the state system that dates back to the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, which divided up the Middle Eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire, as governance erodes in Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria. Obama has done his best to separate the geopolitical issue of Iran’s surging power across the region from the question of its compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, but Israeli and Saudi fears about Iran’s regional ambitions are making that harder to do. Another obstacle to striking agreements with Iran is Russia, which has used its seat on the UN Security Council and support for Assad to set back U.S. goals in Syria.

&gt;Russia sees its influence in the Middle East as an important asset in its competition with the United States. This does not mean that Moscow will reflexively oppose U.S. goals on every occasion, but it does mean that the win-win outcomes that Americans so eagerly seek will sometimes be held hostage to Russian geopolitical interests. In deciding how hard to press Russia over Ukraine, for example, the White House cannot avoid calculating the impact on Russia’s stance on the Syrian war or Iran’s nuclear program. Russia cannot make itself a richer country or a much larger one, but it has made itself a more important factor in U.S. strategic thinking, and it can use that leverage to extract concessions that matter to it.

&gt;If these revisionist powers have gained ground, the status quo powers have been undermined. The deterioration is sharpest in Europe, where the unmitigated disaster of the common currency has divided public opinion and turned the EU’s attention in on itself. The EU may have avoided the worst possible consequences of the euro crisis, but both its will and its capacity for effective action beyond its frontiers have been significantly impaired.

&gt;The United States has not suffered anything like the economic pain much of Europe has gone through, but with the country facing the foreign policy hangover induced by the Bush-era wars, an increasingly intrusive surveillance state, a slow economic recovery, and an unpopular health-care law, the public mood has soured. On both the left and the right, Americans are questioning the benefits of the current world order and the competence of its architects. Additionally, the public shares the elite consensus that in a post–Cold War world, the United States ought to be able to pay less into the system and get more out. When that doesn’t happen, people blame their leaders. In any case, there is little public appetite for large new initiatives at home or abroad, and a cynical public is turning away from a polarized Washington with a mix of boredom and disdain.

&gt;Obama came into office planning to cut military spending and reduce the importance of foreign policy in American politics while strengthening the liberal world order. A little more than halfway through his presidency, he finds himself increasingly bogged down in exactly the kinds of geopolitical rivalries he had hoped to transcend. Chinese, Iranian, and Russian revanchism haven’t overturned the post–Cold War settlement in Eurasia yet, and may never do so, but they have converted an uncontested status quo into a contested one. U.S. presidents no longer have a free hand as they seek to deepen the liberal system; they are increasingly concerned with shoring up its geopolitical foundations.

&gt;THE TWILIGHT OF HISTORY

&gt;It was 22 years ago that Fukuyama published The End of History and the Last Man, and it is tempting to see the return of geopolitics as a definitive refutation of his thesis. The reality is more complicated. The end of history, as Fukuyama reminded readers, was Hegel’s idea, and even though the revolutionary state had triumphed over the old type of regimes for good, Hegel argued, competition and conflict would continue. He predicted that there would be disturbances in the provinces, even as the heartlands of European civilization moved into a post-historical time. Given that Hegel’s provinces included China, India, Japan, and Russia, it should hardly be surprising that more than two centuries later, the disturbances haven’t ceased. We are living in the twilight of history rather than at its actual end.

&gt;A Hegelian view of the historical process today would hold that substantively little has changed since the beginning of the nineteenth century. To be powerful, states must develop the ideas and institutions that allow them to harness the titanic forces of industrial and informational capitalism. There is no alternative; societies unable or unwilling to embrace this route will end up the subjects of history rather than the makers of it.

&gt;But the road to postmodernity remains rocky. In order to increase its power, China, for example, will clearly have to go through a process of economic and political development that will require the country to master the problems that modern Western societies have confronted. There is no assurance, however, that China’s path to stable liberal modernity will be any less tumultuous than, say, the one that Germany trod. The twilight of history is not a quiet time.

&gt;The second part of Fukuyama’s book has received less attention, perhaps because it is less flattering to the West. As Fukuyama investigated what a post-historical society would look like, he made a disturbing discovery. In a world where the great questions have been solved and geopolitics has been subordinated to economics, humanity will look a lot like the nihilistic “last man” described by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche: a narcissistic consumer with no greater aspirations beyond the next trip to the mall.

&gt;In other words, these people would closely resemble today’s European bureaucrats and Washington lobbyists. They are competent enough at managing their affairs among post-historical people, but understanding the motives and countering the strategies of old-fashioned power politicians is hard for them. Unlike their less productive and less stable rivals, post-historical people are unwilling to make sacrifices, focused on the short term, easily distracted, and lacking in courage.

&gt;The realities of personal and political life in post-historical societies are very different from those in such countries as China, Iran, and Russia, where the sun of history still shines. It is not just that those different societies bring different personalities and values to the fore; it is also that their institutions work differently and their publics are shaped by different ideas.

&gt;Societies filled with Nietzsche’s last men (and women) characteristically misunderstand and underestimate their supposedly primitive opponents in supposedly backward societies -- a blind spot that could, at least temporarily, offset their countries’ other advantages. The tide of history may be flowing inexorably in the direction of liberal capitalist democracy, and the sun of history may indeed be sinking behind the hills. But even as the shadows lengthen and the first of the stars appears, such figures as Putin still stride the world stage. They will not go gentle into that good night, and they will rage, rage against the dying of the light.",0,1416264641,null,0,false,0,cm5euik,t3_2mkykt,t1_cm5euik,t1_cm5eu1h,null,1425976349,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

It is true that the US is the greatest influence in NATO, and could, in theory, decide to abandon it.  However it is also the case that most of the organizational and military assets of NATO in Western Europe are European, not US, and can be deployed without US approval.

Nuclear weapons are an exception, where the US has the most, but France and the UK have enough to threaten Russia should the US decide to ""step aside"".

So... for the small ""unimportant"" nations, good relations with other West European countries are more important than good relations with the US. For any Baltic state to be ""abandoned"" would require Poland accepting a new Russian incursion, which I really don't think they would., and if Poland doesn't it is unlikely that Germany, UK, France, etc, would.

Russia's current sabre rattling is the sound of wood crackling in a fire that is soon to die.  There is absolutely no prospect of Russia regaining its Empire, and making it prosper, while taking bites out if its weakest neighbours.

Russia's best prospect is to fashion itself as the Eastern equivalent of Germany, i.e. a country that sinned, but is now redeemed.

&gt;Novodevyatkino district, SPb. Up to this point, the sewage treatment plant in the district was not built yet, although construction has been planned for 20 years and money were allocated. However, sewage water is still being dumped into the river Ohta and further into the Neva and the Gulf of Finland. Ohta flows into the Neva river near the intake of the SPb's water utility, so faeces from Novodevyatkino district  successfully get into the plumbing of Saint-Petersburg.

&gt; Also, people are forced to bathe in faeces in the Gulf of Finland and the Neva River downstream. Novodevyatkino sewage water has been flowing past the luxury yachts in the St. Petersburg Yacht Club and happily absorbed into the bodies of millionaires, who are swimming alongside these yachts. We stress that it is completely untreated sewer water.

&gt;We began to fight for the purity of the waters of St. Petersburg. In order to draw an attention to this environmental problem we decided to explore the sewer emissions of Novodevyatkino. For that purpose we have prepared floating GPS-trackers which resemble faeces by its parameters. According to our calculations, trackers will overcome the Ohta river and will have reached the Neva and the Gulf of Finland within two weeks. This site features a map of the trackers' (and faeces) routes through the rivers.

This article is about how Fukuyama was too short-sighted. I also offered to post the liberal response by G. John Ikenberry, which contains the liberal 'interdependence theory'.. 

The debate, is over the question of whether geopolitics trumps economics (neorealists), or whether economics trumps geopolitics (neoliberalism (neoliberal institutionalism)). 

One point I may make, regarding 'interdependence theory', is that when Merkel publicly stated in March '14 that Putin was 'in another world', and 'delusional', is what she was actually saying is that Putin was not acting according to the assumptions of interdependence theory, which is why more realist arguments such as that being made by Mead here (a first-class researcher) are starting to come to the fore to explain events which such approaches as 'interdependence theory' cannot.

&gt; I'm wondering what exactly you think Russia will do to stop EU intervention in Ukraine, especially considering they are apparently not in it.

Hint: the comments of Putin and his advisors regarding the status of Russians living outside of Russia and how their rights should be protected.

&gt; Yes, what would a native of Northern Ireland, as opposed to a dutchman, know of conflict. Let's use that as an arguement. Let's bring my ethnicity into it.

I don't know if you try to 'frame' me here, but if so, it was a poor attempt. I talked about Ireland, *not* about you being an Irishman. You are obviously much further removed from the conflict then we are, given that Ireland is not part of the European mainland. Nothing more was implied: the Irish know enough of war as it is. 

&gt; This isn't news to anybody and doesn't give a one state sovereingty over parts of another.

This situation is a bit more nuanced: it has been accepted by our governments that a people, if they constitute a people that is (which they do, given that the people we are talking about are Russians), has the right to secede. The pickle here would of course be that the entire movement we are seeing in eastern Ukraine is a kind of sham, but that does not mean that Russians in eastern Ukraine happily belong there. It of course should be clear that another nation is not allowed to instigate unrest as we are seeing here. Which brings me to the following however:

&gt; both Donbas and Crimea are legally Ukranian and can only pass from Ukranian sovreignty through legal mechanisms. Questions of autonomy or separatism should be addressed legally.

Do they? I can tell you that I have above average, if not extensive knowledge of international law (by virtue of my own profession), and this is not a certainty. Of course: the situation you are describing would *normally be the case*, unless a people decides to secede. No laws are required to do that under the right of self determination.

Just imagine that the conflict stops now, and the people of the Donbass get out in the streets (as they did before as well) but this time demanding to leave Ukraine, their rights must be respected. Don't forget that despite the criminal behavior of the current puppet governments in the Donbass regions, there is still widespread disbelief among the populace with regard to the Euromaidan 'coup' (what it formally was, let us be fair here. A revolution is a coup by default). 

I concur that the legal course of action that you propose should be observed, but then again: will the current government allow for a federal state? The Ukrainian prime-minister before already made clear that it is not going to happen. What room will there be left for a minority which rights are not respected (as they view it, I will not comment on the merits of it) in the larger construct of a state?

&gt; It's that simple.

This, with regard to some other responses regarding the chance of nuclear war (as in your other comment) can simple be summarized as : we agree to disagree. You apparantly believe the entirety of the human race, including its leaders, to be rational in the most extreme of situations. I obviously don't, as I know how power can corrupt even at the lowest level of leadership. There is a 'high probability' that no nuclear conflict will happen however. That is something I acknowledge, but that still does not give you the right to simply barge in the Donbass region and possibly unleash nuclear war. 

It goes without saying however that a nuclear war will by default be accompanied with a warning in advance. If Russia warns Western soldiers to get out of the Donbass, and sends in soldiers to force them out, we will have lost twice: the Donbass region will not be reclaimed, and hundreds if not thousands of soldiers will have died for absolutely nothing. We might even lose three times if Russia loses its nerve and indeed starts (selectively) firing warheads.

&gt; There's also a running theme of being terrified of Putin, which baffles me. He's not an inhuman monster, nor is the Russian military likely to invade Utrecht should you oppose rebels in Ukraine.

I am not terrified of him: I simply consider him a possible threat to world peace that should be countered with care and rational thought. Not by emotional means. He will not be able to get past Kiev *no matter how you turn it*: even if Putin manages to take Ukraine (which Nato should never allow), he will hit a solid wall consisting of the EU and NATO. There might be one exception here, that being Moldova, but next to that Putin will not be able to go any further into Europe.

&gt; Do you sincerely believe Putin would nuke Kiev and thus instigate war on a massive scale for the sake of what you described as a strip of soil?

Non sequitur: that is not what I said. Russia *could* (as a remote possibility) nuke Kiev after we were to try to take back that strip of soil. Not because of the territory, but because of *the people* living there which he considers his own. This once again hinges on the rationality of leaders, and clearly (but that's my personal view) he is not the most predictable of persons. There is a clear hatred towards the West in Russia gain nowadays and therefore such an extreme course of action should not be excluded.

But let us simply stop about the entire concept of possible nuclear retaliation: we clearly disagree on this point, and there is no point to go on further about this.",0,1416267794,null,0,1416334167,0,cm5ggoz,t3_2mk4z0,t1_cm5ggoz,t1_cm579ak,null,1425975595,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Too many interests pulling different directions. The UK and France understandably do not want to subsidize everyone else. They pledged greater cooperation between themselves but notably left others out. They are more confrontational than Germany so it would likely not want to be part of an alliance dominated by the UK and France. Poland, Romania, and the Baltics recently pledged greater cooperation, but mainly because of their shared concerns over Russia, whereas many out West seem to think they should calm down. 

Many on this sub think the US is preventing it, but the highest ranking defense official even threatened the US could withdraw from NATO if EU nations dont either spend more or integrate their forces. So its clearly not that. I think it is simply EU nations still have such divergent priorities and military spending to make it agreeable for them. Also, there is a strong temptation to join NATO and cut funding to next to nothing and lean on the alliance for the defense deterrent.

Your comment on Merkel and Putin is interesting. It shows the duality of IR: on the one hand it tries to explain the world, on the other hand it creates the world.

So if there is a gap between the SEC and deposit regulators, it will be much more likely to be spotted early.

Some of these include the creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, Office of Financial Research within the Treasury, independent Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection,  Office of National Insurance,  Office of Credit Rating Agencies. These agencies all have different mandates, which include formulating new rules to regulate their specific specialties in the financial markets. There are new registration and oversight requirements for hedge funds which removes much of the secrecy. There are new limits on what types of risks deposit institutions can take, especially as it pertains to proprietary trading. Companies with complex structures have new reporting requirements. Firms that securitize now must retain a portion of the securities issuances so they have ""skin in the game"" so to speak. There are also far more regulatory disclosures that are necessary (hence London being more 'friendly'). Securitized offerings now have to contain a disclosure stating what legal rights for enforcement a holder has. 

There are *tons* more changes that pertain to disclosure, trading transparency, reporting requirements, etc. but dont want it to be a 5 page comment.

**The Illusion of Geopolitics: The Enduring Power of the Liberal Order**

http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141212/g-john-ikenberry/the-illusion-of-geopolitics

&gt;Walter Russell Mead paints a disturbing portrait of the United States’ geopolitical predicament. As he sees it, an increasingly formidable coalition of illiberal powers -- China, Iran, and Russia -- is determined to undo the post–Cold War settlement and the U.S.-led global order that stands behind it. Across Eurasia, he argues, these aggrieved states are bent on building spheres of influence to threaten the foundations of U.S. leadership and the global order. So the United States must rethink its optimism, including its post–Cold War belief that rising non-Western states can be persuaded to join the West and play by its rules. For Mead, the time has come to confront the threats from these increasingly dangerous geopolitical foes.

&gt;But Mead’s alarmism is based on a colossal misreading of modern power realities. It is a misreading of the logic and character of the existing world order, which is more stable and expansive than Mead depicts, leading him to overestimate the ability of the “axis of weevils” to undermine it. And it is a misreading of China and Russia, which are not full-scale revisionist powers but part-time spoilers at best, as suspicious of each other as they are of the outside world. True, they look for opportunities to resist the United States’ global leadership, and recently, as in the past, they have pushed back against it, particularly when confronted in their own neighborhoods. But even these conflicts are fueled more by weakness -- their leaders’ and regimes’ -- than by strength. They have no appealing brand. And when it comes to their overriding interests, Russia and, especially, China are deeply integrated into the world economy and its governing institutions.

&gt;Mead also mischaracterizes the thrust of U.S. foreign policy. Since the end of the Cold War, he argues, the United States has ignored geopolitical issues involving territory and spheres of influence and instead adopted a Pollyannaish emphasis on building the global order. But this is a false dichotomy. The United States does not focus on issues of global order, such as arms control and trade, because it assumes that geopolitical conflict is gone forever; it undertakes such efforts precisely because it wants to manage great-power competition. Order building is not premised on the end of geopolitics; it is about how to answer the big questions of geopolitics.

&gt;Indeed, the construction of a U.S.-led global order did not begin with the end of the Cold War; it won the Cold War. In the nearly 70 years since World War II, Washington has undertaken sustained efforts to build a far-flung system of multilateral institutions, alliances, trade agreements, and political partnerships. This project has helped draw countries into the United States’ orbit. It has helped strengthen global norms and rules that undercut the legitimacy of nineteenth-century-style spheres of influence, bids for regional domination, and territorial grabs. And it has given the United States the capacities, partnerships, and principles to confront today’s great-power spoilers and revisionists, such as they are. Alliances, partnerships, multilateralism, democracy -- these are the tools of U.S. leadership, and they are winning, not losing, the twenty-first-century struggles over geopolitics and the world order.

&gt;China and Russia are not full-scale revisionist powers but part-time spoilers at best.

&gt;THE GENTLE GIANT

&gt;In 1904, the English geographer Halford Mackinder wrote that the great power that controlled the heartland of Eurasia would command “the World-Island” and thus the world itself. For Mead, Eurasia has returned as the great prize of geopolitics. Across the far reaches of this supercontinent, he argues, China, Iran, and Russia are seeking to establish their spheres of influence and challenge U.S. interests, slowly but relentlessly attempting to dominate Eurasia and thereby threaten the United States and the rest of the world.

&gt;This vision misses a deeper reality. In matters of geopolitics (not to mention demographics, politics, and ideas), the United States has a decisive advantage over China, Iran, and Russia. Although the United States will no doubt come down from the peak of hegemony that it occupied during the unipolar era, its power is still unrivaled. Its wealth and technological advantages remain far out of the reach of China and Russia, to say nothing of Iran. Its recovering economy, now bolstered by massive new natural gas resources, allows it to maintain a global military presence and credible security commitments.

&gt;Indeed, Washington enjoys a unique ability to win friends and influence states. According to a study led by the political scientist Brett Ashley Leeds, the United States boasts military partnerships with more than 60 countries, whereas Russia counts eight formal allies and China has just one (North Korea). As one British diplomat told me several years ago, “China doesn’t seem to do alliances.” But the United States does, and they pay a double dividend: not only do alliances provide a global platform for the projection of U.S. power, but they also distribute the burden of providing security. The military capabilities aggregated in this U.S.-led alliance system outweigh anything China or Russia might generate for decades to come.

&gt;Then there are the nuclear weapons. These arms, which the United States, China, and Russia all possess (and Iran is seeking), help the United States in two ways. First, thanks to the logic of mutual assured destruction, they radically reduce the likelihood of great-power war. Such upheavals have provided opportunities for past great powers, including the United States in World War II, to entrench their own international orders. The atomic age has robbed China and Russia of this opportunity. Second, nuclear weapons also make China and Russia more secure, giving them assurance that the United States will never invade. That’s a good thing, because it reduces the likelihood that they will resort to desperate moves, born of insecurity, that risk war and undermine the liberal order.

&gt;Geography reinforces the United States’ other advantages. As the only great power not surrounded by other great powers, the country has appeared less threatening to other states and was able to rise dramatically over the course of the last century without triggering a war. After the Cold War, when the United States was the world’s sole superpower, other global powers, oceans away, did not even attempt to balance against it. In fact, the United States’ geographic position has led other countries to worry more about abandonment than domination. Allies in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East have sought to draw the United States into playing a greater role in their regions. The result is what the historian Geir Lundestad has called an “empire by invitation.”

&gt;The United States’ geographic advantage is on full display in Asia. Most countries there see China as a greater potential danger -- due to its proximity, if nothing else -- than the United States. Except for the United States, every major power in the world lives in a crowded geopolitical neighborhood where shifts in power routinely provoke counterbalancing -- including by one another. China is discovering this dynamic today as surrounding states react to its rise by modernizing their militaries and reinforcing their alliances. Russia has known it for decades, and has faced it most recently in Ukraine, which in recent years has increased its military spending and sought closer ties to the EU.

&gt;Geographic isolation has also given the United States reason to champion universal principles that allow it to access various regions of the world. The country has long promoted the open-door policy and the principle of self-determination and opposed colonialism -- less out of a sense of idealism than due to the practical realities of keeping Europe, Asia, and the Middle East open for trade and diplomacy. In the late 1930s, the main question facing the United States was how large a geopolitical space, or “grand area,” it would need to exist as a great power in a world of empires, regional blocs, and spheres of influence. World War II made the answer clear: the country’s prosperity and security depended on access to every region. And in the ensuing decades, with some important and damaging exceptions, such as Vietnam, the United States has embraced postimperial principles.

false,TelevisionAntichrist,UNSA,Bad since 1776,"&gt;It was during these postwar years that geopolitics and order building converged. A liberal international framework was the answer that statesmen such as Dean Acheson, George Kennan, and George Marshall offered to the challenge of Soviet expansionism. The system they built strengthened and enriched the United States and its allies, to the detriment of its illiberal opponents. It also stabilized the world economy and established mechanisms for tackling global problems. The end of the Cold War has not changed the logic behind this project.

&gt;Fortunately, the liberal principles that Washington has pushed enjoy near-universal appeal, because they have tended to be a good fit with the modernizing forces of economic growth and social advancement. As the historian Charles Maier has put it, the United States surfed the wave of twentieth-century modernization. But some have argued that this congruence between the American project and the forces of modernity has weakened in recent years. The 2008 financial crisis, the thinking goes, marked a world-historical turning point, at which the United States lost its vanguard role in facilitating economic advancement.

&gt;Russia is experiencing one of the greatest geopolitical contractions of any major power in the modern era.

&gt;Yet even if that were true, it hardly follows that China and Russia have replaced the United States as the standard-bearers of the global economy. Even Mead does not argue that China, Iran, or Russia offers the world a new model of modernity. If these illiberal powers really do threaten Washington and the rest of the liberal capitalist world, then they will need to find and ride the next great wave of modernization. They are unlikely to do that.

&gt;THE RISE OF DEMOCRACY

&gt;Mead’s vision of a contest over Eurasia between the United States and China, Iran, and Russia misses the more profound power transition under way: the increasing ascendancy of liberal capitalist democracy. To be sure, many liberal democracies are struggling at the moment with slow economic growth, social inequality, and political instability. But the spread of liberal democracy throughout the world, beginning in the late 1970s and accelerating after the Cold War, has dramatically strengthened the United States’ position and tightened the geopolitical circle around China and Russia.

&gt;It’s easy to forget how rare liberal democracy once was. Until the twentieth century, it was confined to the West and parts of Latin America. After World War II, however, it began to reach beyond those realms, as newly independent states established self-rule. During the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s, military coups and new dictators put the brakes on democratic transitions. But in the late 1970s, what the political scientist Samuel Huntington termed “the third wave” of democratization washed over southern Europe, Latin America, and East Asia. Then the Cold War ended, and a cohort of former communist states in eastern Europe were brought into the democratic fold. By the late 1990s, 60 percent of all countries had become democracies.

&gt;Although some backsliding has occurred, the more significant trend has been the emergence of a group of democratic middle powers, including Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Korea, and Turkey. These rising democracies are acting as stakeholders in the international system: pushing for multilateral cooperation, seeking greater rights and responsibilities, and exercising influence through peaceful means.

&gt;Such countries lend the liberal world order new geopolitical heft. As the political scientist Larry Diamond has noted, if Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and Turkey regain their economic footing and strengthen their democratic rule, the G-20, which also includes the United States and European countries, “will have become a strong ‘club of democracies,’ with only Russia, China, and Saudi Arabia holding out.” The rise of a global middle class of democratic states has turned China and Russia into outliers -- not, as Mead fears, legitimate contestants for global leadership.

&gt;In fact, the democratic upsurge has been deeply problematic for both countries. In eastern Europe, former Soviet states and satellites have gone democratic and joined the West. As worrisome as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s moves in Crimea have been, they reflect Russia’s geopolitical vulnerability, not its strength. Over the last two decades, the West has crept closer to Russia’s borders. In 1999, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland entered NATO. They were joined in 2004 by seven more former members of the Soviet bloc, and in 2009, by Albania and Croatia. In the meantime, six former Soviet republics have headed down the path to membership by joining NATO’s Partnership for Peace program. Mead makes much of Putin’s achievements in Georgia, Armenia, and Crimea. Yet even though Putin is winning some small battles, he is losing the war. Russia is not on the rise; to the contrary, it is experiencing one of the greatest geopolitical contractions of any major power in the modern era.

&gt;Democracy is encircling China, too. In the mid-1980s, India and Japan were the only Asian democracies, but since then, Indonesia, Mongolia, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand have joined the club. Myanmar (also called Burma) has made cautious steps toward multiparty rule -- steps that have come, as China has not failed to notice, in conjunction with warming relations with the United States. China now lives in a decidedly democratic neighborhood.

&gt;These political transformations have put China and Russia on the defensive. Consider the recent developments in Ukraine. The economic and political currents in most of the country are inexorably flowing westward, a trend that terrifies Putin. His only recourse has been to strong-arm Ukraine into resisting the EU and remaining in Russia’s orbit. Although he may be able to keep Crimea under Russian control, his grip on the rest of the country is slipping. As the EU diplomat Robert Cooper has noted, Putin can try to delay the moment when Ukraine “affiliates with the EU, but he can’t stop it.” Indeed, Putin might not even be able to accomplish that, since his provocative moves may serve only to speed Ukraine’s move toward Europe.

&gt;China faces a similar predicament in Taiwan. Chinese leaders sincerely believe that Taiwan is part of China, but the Taiwanese do not. The democratic transition on the island has made its inhabitants’ claims to nationhood more deeply felt and legitimate. A 2011 survey found that if the Taiwanese could be assured that China would not attack Taiwan, 80 percent of them would support declaring independence. Like Russia, China wants geopolitical control over its neighborhood. But the spread of democracy to all corners of Asia has made old-fashioned domination the only way to achieve that, and that option is costly and self-defeating.

&gt;In the age of liberal order, revisionist struggles are a fool’s errand.
While the rise of democratic states makes life more difficult for China and Russia, it makes the world safer for the United States. Those two powers may count as U.S. rivals, but the rivalry takes place on a very uneven playing field: the United States has the most friends, and the most capable ones, too. Washington and its allies account for 75 percent of global military spending. Democratization has put China and Russia in a geopolitical box.

&gt;Iran is not surrounded by democracies, but it is threatened by a restive pro-democracy movement at home. More important, Iran is the weakest member of Mead’s axis, with a much smaller economy and military than the United States and the other great powers. It is also the target of the strongest international sanctions regime ever assembled, with help from China and Russia. The Obama administration’s diplomacy with Iran may or may not succeed, but it is not clear what Mead would do differently to prevent the country from acquiring nuclear weapons. U.S. President Barack Obama’s approach has the virtue of offering Tehran a path by which it can move from being a hostile regional power to becoming a more constructive, nonnuclear member of the international community -- a potential geopolitical game changer that Mead fails to appreciate.

&gt;REVISIONISM REVISITED

&gt;Not only does Mead underestimate the strength of the United States and the order it built; he also overstates the degree to which China and Russia are seeking to resist both. (Apart from its nuclear ambitions, Iran looks like a state engaged more in futile protest than actual resistance, so it shouldn’t be considered anything close to a revisionist power.) Without a doubt, China and Russia desire greater regional influence. China has made aggressive claims over maritime rights and nearby contested islands, and it has embarked on an arms buildup. Putin has visions of reclaiming Russia’s dominance in its “near abroad.” Both great powers bristle at U.S. leadership and resist it when they can.

&gt;But China and Russia are not true revisionists. As former Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami has said, Putin’s foreign policy is “more a reflection of his resentment of Russia’s geopolitical marginalization than a battle cry from a rising empire.” China, of course, is an actual rising power, and this does invite dangerous competition with U.S. allies in Asia. But China is not currently trying to break those alliances or overthrow the wider system of regional security governance embodied in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the East Asia Summit. And even if China harbors ambitions of eventually doing so, U.S. security partnerships in the region are, if anything, getting stronger, not weaker. At most, China and Russia are spoilers. They do not have the interests -- let alone the ideas, capacities, or allies -- to lead them to upend existing global rules and institutions.

&gt;In fact, although they resent that the United States stands at the top of the current geopolitical system, they embrace the underlying logic of that framework, and with good reason. Openness gives them access to trade, investment, and technology from other societies. Rules give them tools to protect their sovereignty and interests. Despite controversies over the new idea of “the responsibility to protect” (which has been applied only selectively), the current world order enshrines the age-old norms of state sovereignty and nonintervention. Those Westphalian principles remain the bedrock of world politics -- and China and Russia have tied their national interests to them (despite Putin’s disturbing irredentism).

&gt;It should come as no surprise, then, that China and Russia have become deeply integrated into the existing international order. They are both permanent members of the UN Security Council, with veto rights, and they both participate actively in the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the G-20. They are geopolitical insiders, sitting at all the high tables of global governance.

&gt;China, despite its rapid ascent, has no ambitious global agenda; it remains fixated inward, on preserving party rule. Some Chinese intellectuals and political figures, such as Yan Xuetong and Zhu Chenghu, do have a wish list of revisionist goals. They see the Western system as a threat and are waiting for the day when China can reorganize the international order. But these voices do not reach very far into the political elite. Indeed, Chinese leaders have moved away from their earlier calls for sweeping change. In 2007, at its Central Committee meeting, the Chinese Communist Party replaced previous proposals for a “new international economic order” with calls for more modest reforms centering on fairness and justice. The Chinese scholar Wang Jisi has argued that this move is “subtle but important,” shifting China’s orientation toward that of a global reformer. China now wants a larger role in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, greater voice in such forums as the G-20, and wider global use of its currency. That is not the agenda of a country trying to revise the economic order.

&gt;China and Russia are also members in good standing of the nuclear club. The centerpiece of the Cold War settlement between the United States and the Soviet Union (and then Russia) was a shared effort to limit atomic weapons. Although U.S.-Russian relations have since soured, the nuclear component of their arrangement has held. In 2010, Moscow and Washington signed the New START treaty, which requires mutual reductions in long-range nuclear weapons.

&gt;Before the 1990s, China was a nuclear outsider. Although it had a modest arsenal, it saw itself as a voice of the nonnuclear developing world and criticized arms control agreements and test bans. But in a remarkable shift, China has since come to support the array of nuclear accords, including the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. It has affirmed a “no first use” doctrine, kept its arsenal small, and taken its entire nuclear force off alert. China has also played an active role in the Nuclear Security Summit, an initiative proposed by Obama in 2009, and it has joined the “P5 process,” a collaborate effort to safeguard nuclear weapons.

&gt;Across a wide range of issues, China and Russia are acting more like established great powers than revisionist ones. They often choose to shun multilateralism, but so, too, on occasion do the United States and other powerful democracies. (Beijing has ratified the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea; Washington has not.) And China and Russia are using global rules and institutions to advance their own interests. Their struggles with the United States revolve around gaining voice within the existing order and manipulating it to suit their needs. They wish to enhance their positions within the system, but they are not trying to replace it.

&gt;HERE TO STAY

&gt;Ultimately, even if China and Russia do attempt to contest the basic terms of the current global order, the adventure will be daunting and self-defeating. These powers aren’t just up against the United States; they would also have to contend with the most globally organized and deeply entrenched order the world has ever seen, one that is dominated by states that are liberal, capitalist, and democratic. This order is backed by a U.S.-led network of alliances, institutions, geopolitical bargains, client states, and democratic partnerships. It has proved dynamic and expansive, easily integrating rising states, beginning with Japan and Germany after World War II. It has shown a capacity for shared leadership, as exemplified by such forums as the G-8 and the G-20. It has allowed rising non-Western countries to trade and grow, sharing the dividends of modernization. It has accommodated a surprisingly wide variety of political and economic models -- social democratic (western Europe), neoliberal (the United Kingdom and the United States), and state capitalist (East Asia). The prosperity of nearly every country -- and the stability of its government -- fundamentally depends on this order.

&gt;In the age of liberal order, revisionist struggles are a fool’s errand. Indeed, China and Russia know this. They do not have grand visions of an alternative order. For them, international relations are mainly about the search for commerce and resources, the protection of their sovereignty, and, where possible, regional domination. They have shown no interest in building their own orders or even taking full responsibility for the current one and have offered no alternative visions of global economic or political progress. That’s a critical shortcoming, since international orders rise and fall not simply with the power of the leading state; their success also hinges on whether they are seen as legitimate and whether their actual operation solves problems that both weak and powerful states care about. In the struggle for world order, China and Russia (and certainly Iran) are simply not in the game.

&gt;Under these circumstances, the United States should not give up its efforts to strengthen the liberal order. The world that Washington inhabits today is one it should welcome. And the grand strategy it should pursue is the one it has followed for decades: deep global engagement. It is a strategy in which the United States ties itself to the regions of the world through trade, alliances, multilateral institutions, and diplomacy. It is a strategy in which the United States establishes leadership not simply through the exercise of power but also through sustained efforts at global problem solving and rule making. It created a world that is friendly to American interests, and it is made friendly because, as President John F. Kennedy once said, it is a world “where the weak are safe and the strong are just.”",0,1416269833,null,0,false,0,cm5hhp6,t3_2mkykt,t1_cm5hhp6,t1_cm5hf34,null,1425975116,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

false,Parabellum8g,NETH,Indifference is the best kind of tolerance (/s),"Same principle as the previous comment: I will try to keep it a bit shorter (where possible). I once again stress for my dislike for lengthy responses, but here goes:

&gt; I remain waiting legitimately for you to provide an example that you say are out there of appeasement working in this scenario. I'll be surprised if you can find any.

I actually gave you a few: Libya for example, with mad dictator Ghadaffi at the helm was a *vital* ally for the US and Europe in curtailing extremism in his own country. Despite the fact that his government bombed a Pan Am plane over Lockerbie and was openly hostile to both in the past. Remember? I gave you one example, and therefore have proven my point. There are a few more examples out there, but for the sake of my own time I will not go into detail any further on this.

What I will say is that I do not prefer appeasement in any way, as it indeed tends to fail in the long run. Contrary to your opinion however, I will not exclude it.

&gt; War is already upon them damn it. It doesn't stop being war because one side has said ""We haven't formally invaded, and if we did you'd know about it!"" Don't call me a damn warmonger when I'm advocating for an end to a hateful, bloody conflict that you would see prolonged so your conscience could stay clean!

Upon *them*. Very good. You already see where this is going now: *war is not upon* **us**. Nor will it be upon us if we keep following a line of economic sanctions and refraining from military intervention unless that is really necessary (for example in the face of genocide, though there are more grounds). 

&gt; Oh go to hell, will you? You start losing an arguement and you call me a warmonger and selfish? I'm advocating increased sanctions and military intervention at a sovereign states request for help to end an internal dispute financed by a malign foreign power. You offer nothing and decide to attack me personally, to make me into a supervillain so you can substantiate your own position? Grow the hell up, man. That's pathetic.

I consider the fallacious ad hominem a means to an end in certain case. Here I purposely used it to wake you out of your dream of some glorious military adventure on the outskirts of Europe. Even despite your repeated claims that you have seen enough of war (by being Irish), does not make you innocent to what you have been charged of. That is, once again, of warmongering. You *want* to send soldiers and blatantly disregard the consequences of such actions. Starting a war is easy: ending one less so.

What you are proposing *will* lead to *further bloodshed*. Probably much more bloodshed than simply letting this struggle become another 'frozen conflict', which it will be in due time if you are patient enough. At some point the Ukrainian army will simply start consolidating ground in the wake of serious losses, and it will probably retreat West to the de facto borders I described previously. An uneasy peace at best, but still peace. Something completely else than sending in thousands, if not tens of thousands, Western soldiers that might die in great numbers for a matter of principle. Something that is even very likely not to pay off in the end.

Russia will not get what it wants legally: what it is doing is clearly contrary to international law and that will never change. However, putting that into practice by forcing Russia is unwanted for and simply too dangerous. 

You also disregard the fact that there might be a whole other regime in place in Russia in about 10 years, that could in theory pull out of the Donbass regoin after lengthy talks with the Ukrainian government. Unlikely, but possible.

&gt; He's a former Law school student and career politician. He's not fucking Megatron.

Above all he is a former KGB agent that *turned* politician. 

&gt; I downplay it because it isn't a possibility, you overstate it because it's the defining feature of the arguement which you still have to present. You honestly believe we are closer to nuclear war now than we were at the Cuban missile crisis because you've built the head of a much-reduced foe to be some sort of insane super-villain?

Oh come on: the world is build on the threat of mutual destruction. *That* is what still keeps the peace even if the Cold War (shall we call it the First Cold War by now?) has been long over. The doctrine is still there and it regulates possible conflicts between large states into details. If you do not see this, if you really disregard history in this, then there is no point in going further in this. If you ask me to give you a history lesson about the period of history since 1945, I will respectfully decline.

&gt; You are deciding that Europe ends here and the EU has no influence here and that the lives of these Europeans are fine to spend but not ours. They're already dying to defend the borders of their country against a beligerent aggressor that's spending every bit of influence it can marshal to paint them as inhumans and Nazis and your concern is not for them, but for how well the rebels will view you.

Indeed: for now Europe indeed (politically) ends here. The EU got some influence in Ukraine, but you forget that Ukraine directly borders Russia and that the latter feels like it belongs to its backyard. Ukraine has stayed far away from the European project until only very recently, and don't you forget that; Ukraine is not the same as Poland or the Baltic States. Maybe the Ukrainians are Europeans, maybe they aren't. What we are touching here is the difficult subject of 'European identity' which almost no one can give a clear definition of. I before limited it to shared values and cultural heritage, and by using those standards Ukraine can be difficultly integrated in present day Europe.

Not to say that we don't have a lot in common, because we do. Question is whether we have more in common with Ukraine than the latter has with Russia. You seem to be *very sure* about the answer, I will keep some middle ground for now. The political developments that we are seeing nowadays might ensure that Ukraine in 10 to 30 years (possible Western Ukraine by then) will be seen as European. For now however, it has not been settled.

Which of course brings with it that we should preferably stay out of Ukraine by military means. As the Kiev government would not decline any military aid however, I believe there should be a possibility to send soldiers to Ukraine in order to maintain the status quo as we know it as of today. Glorified peacekeepers, though with a political mandate to ensure the integrity of Ukraine west of the Donbass region and north of Crimea. 

&gt; They don't have peace. Ask a Ukranian about this understanding. Tell them about how peace springs from the ground, magically, and is watered from the well of appeasement

Once again, and I have to be blunt here: indeed, they don't. *We do.*  And I prefer to keep it that way until Russia were to really threaten the EU or NATO member states by instigating unrest or even invading them. In that case the tables would of course be completely turned: all means necessary to stop Russian aggression would be warranted in that case. 

&gt; This has been going on for nine bloody months. Nine months of Ukranian deaths, Ukranian loss of infrastructure, Ukranian loss of capital, Ukranian loss of education, Ukranian loss of futures. It needs to end so the damn dying can stop and these people can rebuild their lives, whether we make the move through decisive sanctions or invited military intervention. Their crime was wanting to join the damn EU. Perhaps we should show ourselves worthy of the cost of their dead.

I will describe what I see here. Stay calm and don't get angry: I see an emotional, irrational statement reminiscent of a crying idealist. You seem to  feel personally for the Ukrainians. So do I, deeply. Only it doesn't get to me as in proposing to plunge dozens of other nations into war as well, even if that means the loss of certain parts of Ukraine.

As I said before: Putin will stop after this (with the only exception possibly being Moldova, but we could remedy that if we are vigilant). There is no reason to escalate the situation as you are suggesting, as sending soldiers will create much, **much** uncertainty about what could possibly happen. 

I will not take part in proposing such plans and nor should you. Do you know what the difficulty is with war? You know when it begins, but you never know where it will end. You cannot possibly predict where your glorious intervention will end, nor what will happen to the soldiers involved, nor how Russia will react. 

As you seem to disregard all of that, I indeed repeat my claim before that you are a warmonger. You may say that you are not, but you are calling for open military intervention that will surely lead to a confrontation with Russia.  There is nothing unreasonable in stating that you disregard peace in that sense.

* There's a street market with an amazing spread every day. Here in Atlanta, I'll decide what to make for dinner and then head out to pick up ingredients. In Paris, I go to the street market and build around whatever looks good.
* Grab a book and kick back in the [Jardin de Luxembourg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jardin_du_Luxembourg).
* Go for a walk on the [Promenade plantée](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promenade_plant%C3%A9e).

There aren't new estimates, but it will cause the world supply to be exhausted far before 2080.

First Google result for ""how long will uranium last"":

&gt;If the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has accurately estimated the planet's economically accessible uranium resources, reactors could run more than **200 years** at current rates of consumption.

&gt; First, the extraction of uranium from seawater would make available 4.5 billion metric tons of uranium—a **60,000-year supply** at present rates. Second, fuel-recycling fast-breeder reactors, which generate more fuel than they consume, would use less than 1 percent of the uranium needed for current LWRs.

The big thing is to make sure that the seam between the sole and the boot is not low to the ground, if that makes sense.  The seam is where liquid can get in, and if snow hasn't been cleared, there can be a few inches of it.  Something like L.L. Bean boots are good because the seam is really high off the ground, but they're not very stylish.

I had a pair of fleece-lined Hush Puppies that I loved and completely wore out.  They leaked a little after being out in the snow for a long time but not too bad.  Then I got two pairs of Rieker boots at the same time.  They are the worst boots I have ever had; they leaked really badly and then never completely dried out, so they smelled awful.  Since then, I've had two pairs of Tamaris boots, and I've been happy with both.  I managed to find some with decent linings, spray them with waterproofing spray, and it takes a while for them to start to leak - like, standing around in a few inches of snow for 5-10 minutes.

It actually depends on the person you are adressing.

of course ou can call the police and say you would rather not say your name: but if this case would come to a court you would have to be the witness, so no anonymous reporting that way.

Now to something else: In germany pets are considered objects in the eyes of the law. If you kill someones dog, it's like breaking a vase.

On the other hand, animal abuse is a crime.
§17 in the tierschg (animal safty law)

Mit Freiheitsstrafe bis zu drei Jahren oder mit Geldstrafe wird bestraft, wer


1. ein Wirbeltier ohne vernünftigen Grund tötet oder


2.einem Wirbeltier

a) aus Rohheit erhebliche Schmerzen oder Leiden oder


b) länger anhaltende oder sich wiederholende erhebliche Schmerzen oder Leiden zufügt.

So I guess for you the interesting part is 2a)&amp;b):

a) to inflict intense pain out of crudeness

b) to inflict longer or repeating intense pain

So if you really think that this is the case. An anonymous report is enough since he breake the law and the police officer should press charges against him. But since he wouldn't have any proof...

I have to partially disagree with /u/tin_dog, if you are lucky, they will know what to do, but the people in Tierschutzvereinen are often not smarten than you are. [Source](http://www.tierschutz-ohne-grenzen.de/site.php?site=74) I highly recommend checking this out, since this shows seems to be just your case (maybe get someone to translate it for you if you feel it's too much german ;))

Otherwisse just google e.g. Tierquälerei anzeigen or anything in that general direction. You can find good sources of help there: What to do, so you don't have a problem with credibility later on.

If she's a feminist then I am a whale. 

You know how you know your site sucks? When the subs that call themselves 'progressive' identify with very reactionary social views. Reddit in a nutshell, apparently this sub too now, ah, the shame. I'm a Russian too liberal for Russia and apparently too progressive for this sub. 

I swear reddit seems like a collection of edgy youths sometimes, there is such a thing as professional attire. I'm not saying you can't have Casual Fridays, but typically people are expected to show up to work in professional or at the very least inoffensive clothing. There are people who have achieved 100x more than he did and didn't use it as an excuse to wear shirts like those. 

30 yrs ago he would have been likewise reprimanded, even though Tumblr did not exist. Except it wouldn't have made as much news because nobody would try to defend him... Tumblr didn't create this shitestorm, people who inexplicably defend him did. 30 yrs ago he would be chastised for wearing that and that would be it, period. I find it amusing that people on this sub blame SJWs and Tumblerinas for something that was never acceptable and would have not been a big deal if people didn't take sides in a onesided issue. Female scientists do face issues in male-dominated fields of science, female scientists still face objectification, how is helpful that he wears that shirt, regardless of who gave it to him?

I am grown up actually. That's part of growing up. Learning that you cannot always run around with an erection. Yes, we are sexual beings. No, the workplace is not the appropriate place to express this. Workplace has a concept called 'professional environment'. It's very important. 
****
Objectification is not to be taken lightly, most women dislike being objectified and a workplace environment is a concept built around making every member of the workplace comfortable. Let me guess, you're a guy, huh? Well I'm a guy too. But I have plenty of female friends. And I talk to them. Objectification really sucks, if you don't have a lot of contact with women you really don't learn to appreciate how much it sucks to be a woman and to be objectified. Men think it's cool to be objectified or at least OK, a lot of men would love to be, so I hear many redditors say... 

That's because men aren't really objectified, not anywhere on the same level as women. A male scientist will always be judged on the value of his brains first. Not so with a female scientist however, not always. A lot of times people will see you as woman first, scientist later. In a lot of STEM fields being a woman is downright horrifying at times, you can just imagine how, I see plenty of creepiness on reddit to know how it is IRL, I hear a lot of complaints about creepy men hitting on women from my female friends. It's kinda scary when you think about it, when they relate to me they say how much it scares them sometimes. As a man you simply cannot relate to that. We do not walk around afraid when we hear a woman interested in us.

&gt;Good luck turning everyone into an asexual blob though.

False dichotomy. You can be as sexual as you want privately or even publicly. Just not in a workplace. That's a different environment, it is an environment that focuses on productivity, and sexuality hampers productivity. You know why fucking your coworkers is prohibited in a lot of workplaces? Not because they want us to be asexual blobs, but because they want professionalism, productivity and an effort to minimise drama at work. 

&gt;And fuck your professional attire, we're not living in the 50s anymore.

Good luck with that, how old are you anyway? You still have to be somewhat presentable in most places of work, unless you work in a very high position or in a very low position. Also, newsflash: your attire creates an impression of you in others. You know how reddit looks down on black people who wear 'thug' clothing? Funny how that doesn't apply to 'neckbeard' clothing hah.

Sexuality was not as repressed in the mediaeval times as you think. Men fucked anything that walked with a lot less consequences than they did in other time periods. Women were a different matter, but that had more to do with wider social views of that era rather than the Church enforcing misogyny -- one only need to look at modern day Internet atheist (ahem thunderf00t and Amazing Atheist as well as much of reddit) to see why atheism and misogyny are just as compatible as Catholicism and misogyny.

 For instance, buggery ('dominant' anal sex) was widely overlooked by everyone and the Church as 'men will be men' and prostitution was very common and semi-accepted part of society to the point that the Catholic Church ran quite a few brothels themselves. Protect the virtuous women as they rationalised then and allow the men a sort of a 'harm reduction' pathway much akin to Portuguese policy on hard drugs, if you will. If that's not pragmatism, I don't know what is. 

Arguably the Protestants did far more to turn us into asexuals than Catholics, speaking as a Russian atheist and someone who has a BA in history (albeit classical studies, not mediaeval or early modern). It wasn't until the Victorian Era when public enforcement of prudery reached apogee in Western culture.

&gt;And that what this ""feminist"" fundamentalists are aiming for. Controlling men's sexuality with their weird P.C. When you can't even say anything anymore without being accused of ""harassment"", then they have reached their objective.

No wonder I have -4 by your name according to RES, I don't downvote anyone I directly argue with as it is cowardly, but I do downvote people I do not engage with, looks like you managed to say enough crazy things in the past for me to bother to downvote you. That's no small feat, I am a very lazy son of a bitch when it comes to voting, I rarely bother to. 

Most feminists actually strive for sexual liberation, so men and women can express their sexuality without being judged for it. Which does NOT extend to HARASSMENT however. Nobody wants unwanted sexual advances especially when many women are deeply discomforted by such advances from men -- you're not afraid of getting raped when a girl hits on you, but women can be quite often, I've noticed this a while ago when talking to my female friends. There is a fundamental difference in the male and female experience, if you're limited in your own contact with women I can see how that may be an issue for you to understand.

Wenn man so gut wie gar nichts von der Welt weiß, dann kann man das sogar glauben. Als erstes empfehle ich, sich einen Globus zuzulegen. Kenntnisse über die Geographie sind der erste Schritt zur Erkenntnis über die Welt. 

Es wäre auch schön, wenn sich die USA das einmal zu Herzen nähmen, bevor sie das nächste Mal denken, mit ein paar Bomben auf eine Stadt ist ein Land schon zu ""befreien"" oder zu ""befrieden"" oder was gerade so anliegt.

Denn was man als nächstes verinnerlichen muss, ist dass das, was man auf dem Globus sieht, nicht die wirklichen Länder sind, sondern nur ganz kleine Abbildungen davon im Maßstab 1:40.000.000. Das bedeutet, dass die Länder in Wirklichkeit viel größer sind, als man dort sieht, und auch größer, als man sich das als Deutscher vorstellt, der nicht viel mehr als seinen Kreis oder sein Bundesland kennt. 

Auf dem Globus könnt ihr Euch dann mal ansehen, wie groß Russland ist (nicht vergessen: 40 Mio. Mal größer als auf der Kugel vor Euch!). Und dann wird Euch vielleicht aufgehen, dass die dümmste Verschwörungstheorie die ist, die besagt, dass Putin sein Reich vergrößern möchte. Er hat nicht mal genug Leute, um Russlands Osten zu bevölkern. 

Als nächsten Schritt stellen wir uns dann vor, dass in all den kleinen Tälern und Auen in all den vielen Ländern Menschen leben. Das werden auch ganz schön viele, wenn man sich das so vorstellt. Allein in der Stadt Donezk waren es vor dem Krieg 1 Mio. Menschenkinder, die dort lebten, arbeiteten und zur Schule gingen, etc. 

Das Interessante dabei ist, dass die gar nicht überall das gleiche machen und die gleichen Sachen gut finden. Es gibt unterschiedliche Traditionen und Religionen sowie unterschiedliche politische Ausrichtungen und Affiliationen. Die Leute im Osten der Ukraine z.B. sind eher russophil (ich weiß, für viele ist das schwer vorzustellen) und fanden eher den Janukowitsch gut. Die waren nicht glücklich darüber, als der abgesetzt wurde und als sich nationalistische und antirussische Tendenzen in der Westukraine auszubreiten begannen. 

Daher haben die sich aufgelehnt und unterstützen mehrheitlich den Aufstand in der Ostukraine, wie sie kürzlich in Wahlen zum Ausdruck gebracht haben - die Wahlen übrigens, die Poroschenko zum Anlass genommen hat, das Waffenstillstandsabkommen von Minsk aufzukündigen.

&gt;At any rate, I don't see much ""sexually objectifying"" about the shirt. It's just cartoony drawings of a woman.

Are you a woman who speaks for all women? Then it isn't up for you to decide. I absolutely hate it when people say ""that doesn't sound/look racist/sexist to me!"". Well good for you, but you're not the only one here. If you're not the target of the objectification, why do you think your opinion even matters a great deal here? You cannot ask a white person to decide whether something is offensive or not to black people anymore than you can ask a male to decide whether something is offensive or not to a female.

Objectification is a very uniquely female issues: as men we face it as well, but on a much lesser scale and frequently we do not object to it. Women do, because for women it's not just a cute thing, it's a legitimate problem that can face them almost every day of their lives depending on their environment and their own personal appearance. 

&gt;No nudity or anything, and it seems like it's a fairly assertive woman portrayed on the shirt.

Or maybe you're not the target of the objectification and/or discrimination and you make a very stereotypically majority statement of 'If I don't have a problem with it I don't see why others should'. 

Look, I'm sorry for being so snarky, it's just that offensiveness doesn't work that way. Whenever there is an issue like this, typically the offended party gets to decide. Take the controversy over the 'Redskins' name in the US. White people can voice their opinions left and right but it's ultimately to the Natives to decide. If a portion of Natives is offended by it, it should go. Same here.

It seems expensive, but so convenient once you've got it. If you ride at least twice a day (to and from work) five days a week, it's more than worth it. Some employers even subsidise them. Plus with the monthly pass, you can ride to anywhere in Ile-de-France on the weekend, not just your zones, without paying extra. 

I should add that since it is coming to the end of November, you should wait until the end of the month to buy a monthly. You could buy a weekly for next week though.

There is also typically a narrow remedy. I have not read the agreements for the Germany/Sweden case, so I am just guessing, but it is likely the Swedish company suing Germany for phasing out nuclear would only be able to recover the funds it invested under the assumption nuclear power would continue to remain a viable form of production. For example, say it wanted to pull out of Germany completely after the nuclear phase out and it invested €1 billion in a nuclear plant and €1 billion in power line upgrades in Germany. It typically would only recover the €1 billion it invested in the power plant because it was a billion euro asset at the time, but the new legislation ultimately made it worthless. Even though it would like to invest elsewhere, its power line upgrade would have to be sold or leased and would not be recoverable (although keep in mind this is a typical agreement). I understand the sentiment, ""fuck the companies, they make enough money already."" But if you look at it from their perspective, who would want to invest where their investments could become worthless overnight and they would have no recourse?

&gt;it must be a fear that dealing with US companies would be a different beast than the internal market ones of the EU.

European companies can be as big of bullies as any. In fact, they are the most prolific users of ISDS clauses. German car companies challenged the entire structure of US agency law claiming states did not have the legal right to set different standards than the US federal government. It claimed the standards set by California's Environmental Protection Agency were illegal and all state environmental protections needed to be repealed (there is an environmental protection agency for each state and the federal one. States can sets standards above those of the federal EPA but not below them). That was not under an ISDS clause, but simply US agency law. It did not stop them from thinking they should be in charge of how US agency law is structured instead of the US government though.

Le hic avec les recettes américaines, quand on est en France, c'est de trouver les ingrédients. Je sais pas comment s'appelle le ""evaporated milk"" en France, je crois que ça correspond à du lait concentré non sucré, et la crème sûre et le bacon peuvent sans doute être remplacés par de la crème fraiche et des lardons (il y a pas de lardons ici, c'est la dèche). Après faut convertir les tasses en millilitres, mais c'est bon, vous êtes des as de l'internet, vous savez faire ça.
