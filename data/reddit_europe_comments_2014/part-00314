Yes, by 2020s Russia will likely export more energy and more of its resource commodities to China. But the thing is those exports won't replace the volumes (and probably not prices) exported to the EU and especially volume of the energy (oil, natural gas) exported to China will remain a fraction of what is currently exported to the EU. 

And the other very important thing of note is China's long term strategy:   China will never choose to import a major fraction of its energy sources from Russia and risk becoming dependend in the process.

&gt;__John Harvey Kellogg__, [M.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.D.) (February 26, 1852 – December 14, 1943) was an [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) [medical doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_doctor) in [Battle Creek, Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Creek,_Michigan), who ran a [sanitarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanatorium) using [holistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holistic_medicine) methods, with a particular focus on [nutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition), [enemas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enema) and [exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise). Kellogg was an advocate of [vegetarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism) and is best known for the invention of the [breakfast cereal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_cereal) known as [corn flakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_flakes) with his brother, [Will Keith Kellogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Keith_Kellogg). 

&gt;He led in the establishment of the [American Medical Missionary College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Medical_Missionary_College). The College, founded in 1895, operated until 1910 when it merged with [Illinois State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_State_University).

Puis voilà, tout est dit, tu vois l'exposition comme une réponse aux ""interrogations sexuelles des gamins"". Premièrement, en quoi ça nous regarde ? Cela relève d'interrogations qu'on aborde dans la sphère familiale, car on parle de choses qui sont éminemment intimes. Deuxièmement, alors qu'ils ne demandent rien, les gamins sont exposé à des choses que les adultes pensent avoir en toute confiance réglées, alors qu'eux mêmes n'arrivent toujours pas à se responsabiliser dans leurs actes (toute forme de *contraception* en est la preuve évidente).

vous ou un membre de votre foyer, en raison de difficultés financières ?""


33% ont répondu oui.

12% pour des soins médicaux courants (en Allemagne c'est 5% et en Grande-Bretagne c'est 2%), 7% pour des soins lourds (autant qu'en Allemagne, 2% en Grande-Bretagne), et 7% pour les médicaments (13% en Allemagne, 2% en Grande-Bretagne)

And that's without even talking about the evidence glaring them in the face form Britain and America, who's central banks decided to take on a policy of ""quantitative easing"" which isn't quite Keynesianism but does achieve a lot of the same goals. The European Central Bank (as opposed to the Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank of England) has had its hands tied a bit more. 

In the face of all this, I wouldn't be surprised if the new commission back tracked just a little. They're not completely back tracking, though. Junker is talking about ""three pillars"" to economic recovery: ""restructuring"" of national government economic policy and increased fiscal credibility by national governments. Both those two pillars indicate he's keeping with the market reforms, which are not limited to but have largely included austerity. 

So Juncker seems to be going for a very strange double pronged approach of market reforms [esp. austerity] but also stimulus, in certain places. From the sounds if it, the stimulus is definitely the smallest part, seeing as Juncker is only pledging 300 billion Euros, which is rather minute in comparison to the entirety of the EU. ~~That's less than €1 *€10* for every EU citizen (there's 500bil *500 million* EU citizens).~~ *However much money 300 billion [Juncker stimulus] divided by 500 million [EU population] equals, it's not gonna be much money per person!* Although, the crisis areas are relatively few (Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Italy teeters wildly on the edge) and if the €300 billion was focused on those regions it could kick start their economies [esp. given that the market reforms are already pretty severe by this point], start them importing products from the rest of Europe which would reinforce the central/Western European export economies like France and Germany (at least one of which has faced appalling drops in exports recently, leading to fears of recession).

Their problem was fishy bookkeeping, not overborrowing on its own.

Of course you can boost sales by giving discounts, but every shopkeeper knows that you can't have discounts forever; they only make sense if you attract customers that will return and buy at normal prices.

Experience corroborates that: most countries that devalued once needed to devalue again some years later. It's not a solution, it's a band-aid at most.

It means that if banks leave their money with the ECB, that the pile of money will get smaller instead of getting bigger (albeit by a tiny amount in either direction) encouraging banks to invest the money for better return on investment, although this doesn't seem to have been very effective, yet. 

A UK government idea, briefly, was for banks to give loans to first time buyers (which is entirely usual) but the government would agree to pay for the loan in the instance that the [new] homer owners couldn't. This would mean that the loan would become *amazingly* secure. There's basically a 0% chance that the loan will be defaulted on and a 100% chance that you'll get your money back. This means that banks would be hugely incentivise to offer out loans to first time buyers, and as such, would offer *cheaper* loans to first time buyers, making houses more accessible and increasing demand in the construction industry and property market. 

Juncker might be planning to do something like this. The percentage of debts which will be defaulted on will still be relatively small, even on relatively high risk loans [well, so long as it doesn't get to the extent that it did in 2008] so the EU could secure 300,000,000,000€ of investments whilst only spending a fraction of that money.

&gt;It is hardly surprising that the new study is generating alarmist headlines, such as “STUDY: US IS AN OLIGARCHY, NOT A DEMOCRACY,” from, of all places, the BBC. Gilens and Page do not use the term “oligarchy” in describing their conclusions, which would imply that a small ruling class dominates the political system to the exclusion of all others

&gt;The evidence that Gilens and Page present needs careful intepretation. For example, the opinion surveys they rely on suggest that, on many issues, people of different incomes share similar opinions. To quote the paper: “Rather often, average citizens and affluent citizens (our proxy for economic elites) want the same things from government.” This does get reflected in policy outcomes. Proposals that are supported up and down the income spectrum have a better chance of being enacted than policies that do not have such support. To that extent, democracy is working.

And to the studies flaws.

&gt;The paper is a provocative one, and there’s sure to be a lot of debate among political scientists about whether it wholly supports the authors’ claims. One issue is that their survey data is pretty old: it covers the period from 1982 to 2002. (On the other hand, it hardly seems likely that the influence of the affluent has declined in the past decade.) Another issue is that, in a statistical sense, the explanatory power of some of the equations that Gilens and Page use is weak. For example, the three-variable probability model that I referred to above explains less than ten per cent of the variation in the data. (For you statistical wonks, R-squared = 0.074.)

&gt;Even in this sort of study, that’s a pretty low figure. Gilens and Page, to their credit, draw attention to it in their discussion, and suggest various reasons for why it’s not a big issue. They also acknowledge another possible objection to their conclusions:

Average citizens are inattentive to politics and ignorant about public policy; why should we worry if their poorly informed preferences do not influence policy making? Perhaps economic elites and interest group leaders enjoy greater policy expertise than the average citizen does. Perhaps they know better which policies will benefit everyone, and perhaps they seek the common good, rather than selfish ends, when deciding which policies to support… But we tend to doubt it.

I can't see how it's possible to shoot down by mistake a plane flying at civilian heigh with civilian plane speed and identified on public available radars as civilian plane for Ukrainian cargo one.

Also the radar BUK systems come equipped with radar that is clearly seen on all other nearby radars while it can look only at one direction (120-180º) at a time.

Because of that if rebels had that kind of a system (which is not proven by the way). The only scenario in which they have shot down MH17 is because they were feed misinformation on purpose by Ukrainian forces. 

Because as I stated before - these type of systems only could have been used in the manner of turning it on, shooting a target and then intermediately (5 minutes later) shooting it off and moving from the launching point to avoid incoming Ukrainian tactical missiles locked on the radar sign.

Nobody asking about those aspects. Instead people post screenshots of some fake social media accounts and years old videos/photos. Which is more similar to conspiracy theory to me.

Also the pattern of damage caused by projectiles from what I have seen from photos doesn't match the one usually made by 50-100kg warhead of a BUK missile (the spread is much bigger, almost 20m and the damage is greater).",0,1413985300,null,0,false,0,clgisrb,t3_2jz26e,t1_clgisrb,t1_clgg6k8,null,1426406660,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

On top of all that, I got a sweet deal on my place and pay a lot less than others normally would!

However, I do agree with you with that concept. I prefer living in a quiet, or decently quiet area, while at the same time being surrounded by some action or just life. And you're right, generally, it is paying more money for a worse quality of life. If I had to pick between the two extremes with no medium, I would do the same thing you would: live in a quiet place with easy access to the action.

I think the places filled with the most action at night, with A LOT of noise, would be the areas in Malasaña and Chueca. Me as a student that takes his studies seriously, would not live there simply for how crazy it gets at night (a lot more drunk people there and prostitutes). However, it's only about a 10 minute walk down the street from my place before I'm in those areas, so I got the best of both worlds ;) haha I guess I lucked out!",0,1413985351,null,0,false,0,clgitil,t3_2jvl6y,t1_clgitil,t1_clgf0u0,null,1426406650,2,false,Madrid,t5_2si9y,2

No their problem was over borrowing, as being in the Euro allowed them to borrow at a much lower interest rate.

Yes i know they hid the debt but that is just a symptom of over borrowing.

&gt; Of course you can boost sales by giving discounts, but every shopkeeper knows that you can't have discounts forever; they only make sense if you attract customers that will return and buy at normal prices.

Thats all true, but this isnt a ""discount"", its the devaluation of an economy to make it more competitive within the international community, any sales are better than no sales.

&gt; Experience corroborates that: most countries that devalued once needed to devalue again some years later. It's not a solution, it's a band-aid at most.

Where is the evidence for this?

&gt; Germany indeed only profited in the short term, in the long run mercantilism just causes a depression for everyone. But the true beneficiaries of the financial crisis are the financial institutions that were bailed out by the states, at the expense of the citizens of the states that did.

But that in tern benefits the citizens which have money or assets saved in those very same financial institutions.

I'm sure that you are a quite mature 16 year old person. But learning things takes time and experience. Look back at the 12 year old you and you'll notice some differences, the same will be true about 16 year old you in 4 years.

We, as humans, mostly think that we are complete as we are in the present. And we mostly cringe at our past selves for the things that we can no longer relate to. If you keep growing as a person (something that I highly suggest that people should do throughout their entire lives) you won't ever be done with who you are.

Of course there are ignorant people of all ages, genders and ethnicities  and if you cherry-pick examples based on your own experience you can justify anything and come to any conclusion. 

I'm 28 and I also thought that I was done at 16, that all I had left to do was collect knowledge and that I knew *who* I was and that that would never change. I thought the same thing at the age of 18, that I had ridden myself from the flaws that 16 year old me had and that I was done. 

And so it continued until I realized that, yes age doesn't have much to do with it when it comes to me personally because I was ""better"" than many old people. But age had affected me for every year that went on, and I see it in all my friends too. Not all good change, many became more bigoted when they could have gone the other way. But most have become more nuanced and are able to think and reason in ways that they, we, weren't before.

I guess that I do hang out with, say, 26-year-olds, a lot. And ironically 14-year-olds. I have exactly one 16-year-old good friend. I'm in university (yeah, usually that comes later in life), so most of the people around me are way older. While previously in my life I was the oldest kid in the neighborhood.

And yes, of course age affects me. I was simply commenting on the fact that older people, on average, are only *that much slightly* more nuanced than younger people.

The king pretty much shat himself during the First Gulf War and is dependent on the US. Discarding some sort of hegemonic US will since WWII is shortsighted. 

&gt; There are plenty of sufficient reasons to overthrow Assad. Besides, if it was to reduce Russian influence why would they promise to maintain the Russian naval base there then?

Nice R2P thinking here. As I reminder, wars are only authorized by the UNSC, and the US showed didn't anything close to a proof with regards to the use of chemical weapons by Assad...just like they did with WMDs and the Russian 'invasion' of Ukraine. As for the naval base, let's not be naïve and take the Saudi's word for it - look at how the UN resolution for Libya was twisted.

&gt; And that is the fault of the USA because they didn't invade fast enough, but not of Assad who was butchering his own citizens.

Take it as you will, but according to a Lebanese blog, they did 'invade' -&gt; they tried firing missiles that were intercepted by Russians S400 which revealed they have a 10y lead in defense (read: not attack) military technology.

&gt; You would probably start mass producing nukes, and the only sane response of that alliance would be to preemptively invade you.

More nukes being built by one side brings more nukes being built by the other, see the Cold War. That's a bit saner than invading a nuclear power.

&gt; Given the proportion of military power they have, they're doves.

What is so wonderful about warlords carving up Libya and leaking to Mali ?

Nothing, but it's off-topic: we're discussing the US bypassing international law when it suits their interests while asking others to respect it.

&gt; Legit casus belli.

Nope, Talibans are not Al-Qaeda.

Maybe you should check yours first considering you argued we didn't invade Syria because 'there was no good side', implying there's a good side.

We're arguing whether the West can and should impose their vision of the world by illegal bombings, what you're saying isn't very relevant.

Happened many times before.

Plus, separatists themselves thought they shot down a cargo plane in the beginning.

&gt;Also the radar BUK systems come equipped with radar that is clearly seen on all other nearby radars while it can look only at one direction (120-180º) at a time.

They managed to shoot several planes(including cargo) down for weeks before the incident and after. I don't see how is that an argument here.

&gt;Also the pattern of damage caused by projectiles from what I have seen from photos doesn't match the one usually made by 50-100kg warhead of a BUK missile (the spread is much bigger, almost 20m and the damage is greater).

Because in all those cases a MANPADS was used, which can shoot down planes below 3-5km depending on the model. Not a civilian plane flying at 10km.

&gt;Plus, separatists themselves thought they shot down a cargo plane in the beginning.

This came from some unofficial, maybe faked social media groups which is unknown yet who is carrying them.

As I stated before and explained the reasons - they couldn't have had the system enabled monitoring the sky. Then only reason to turn it on (if they had one) would be to make the kill. 

&gt;German intelligence disagree with you. But I guess somehow I have to believe a commentator on internet and assume conspiracy on German side.

German intelligence report as it's stated in Der Spiegel stated that the plane was shot down by Ukrainian BUK which was in the rebels control. If you agree with that statement (with which I don't).

With the exception of Greece those countries did nothing wrong. Were they wasteful spenders? Well, then how do explain that Spain had less debt than Germany then?

The crisis was caused by overleveraged private financial institutions. The governments were forced to bail them out, leading to balance of payment problems. That on its own wouldn't even have been a crisis, merely an inconvenient problem, were it not for the refusal to let the ECB do what the task of any central bank is: being the lender of last resort for the government that uses its currency. Even now, when there are hard numbers on the table that show that the Euro doesn't reach its inflation target, proving undubitably that there's not enough liquidity, an expansive monetary policy is still not accepted even though it directly violates the primary task in the statutes of the ECB: maintaining the stability of the Euro.

Because that will only make them see me as an idiot and then they won't listen to anything that I have to say.

I would say the issue in democracy in Europe is not so much money buying elections by being able to afford better campaigns, but an ""orthodoxy"" that is agreed upon by mainstream parties, big business, and the EU. Basically I think you are extrapolating US issues too much into European ones. Problems are similar, and money is very prominent, but the systems are still pretty different.

There is a certain type of EU-adherent that believes that everyone in the EU thinks exactly same and that therefore a federation could be implemented as early as next year. Reality however tells a different story.
 
In my view, I believe that the definition of being 'European' is limited to *shared values*. Many European countries have been influenced by a few important historical persons, whether that is in law, philosophy or some other area of thinking, which in turn reflects on its citizens. Most young people that I meet nowadays from other European countries aren't that different, although I once again emphasize that there still are some major differences especially with regard to certain points of view that have a more national scope.
 
Geography can be used to draw an arbitrary boundary, but it does not really cut it.  In short, I'd say that we within the European family of nations have more in common with one another than compared to other countries.

I didn't change my belief precisely because I did not find compelling evidence for atheism. I also grew up in a state atheist country, China, if that matters at all. 

In the end, I think it's really irrational to think that belief in religion has to be irrational since it isn't empirical. I personally agree with the [ontological argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument): it seems philosophically logical to posit that more and more powerful beings, from humans to Star Trek's Q, exist all the way up to an omniscient God.

OTOH though, one great problem with arguments for theism or atheism is that they often consider hidden assumptions, which usually boils down to ""is it likely that God exists"", ending up in a circular argument. ""Philosophically reasonable"" is highly subjective.

Let's take r/atheism's favorite, ""Russell's teapot"". The idea is that people believe there is probably no teapot in orbit around the Earth, because it's *a priori* ridiculous, without needing any scientific evidence for the lack of a teapot. Atheists commonly use this argument to claim that God is like the teapot. However, theists clearly don't agree that God is *a priori* ridiculous just like a teapot in orbit is. I could use the same argument to defeat atheists if I think atheism is teapot-ridiculous.

(One other problem I didn't touch is that I don't actually agree with the argument of Russell's teapot at all. We do not have to dismiss the teapot because it's somehow common sense ""ridiculous"", but because of logical reasons. Teapots are invented by humans, so humans must have put them in orbit if they are in orbit. No space agency would waste money to put something useless in orbit, therefore, there are no teapots in orbit.)

It has a decent variety of topics between the reports and it's not gonna bore you with too much Italian politics. Keep in mind that they alternate between almost cringy reports that try to be funny and serious and interesting ones, so try several ones before judging the show. 

Some people might not appreciate it because in the past they made some misleading reports, but compared to other tv programs I'd say it's pretty decent and it's worth taking a look at some reports. The videos are not region-locked and they even have a decent app for iOS and Android.

""Sadly"" most of the best movies and series in Italian use strong dialects. After all, the funny accent is what helped the most popular actors become famous in Italy. If you wanna hear standard Italian, the best way is to watch American movies dubbed in Italian. Italian dubbing is pretty decent. Italians show a bit of ethnocentrism when they say that they have the best dubbing in the world, but trust me, it's pretty decent, although it sounds ""fake"".

I could recommend you [The Best of Youth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346336/). It's very long, but surprisingly catchy and deep.

false,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Essentially the goal must be that banking becomes boring again.

I'm not sure if I agree with you (surprise!) here on the basis that:

- Our entire system of capitalism involves an element of risk. Inherent in any stock exchange is the possibility that values can collapse quickly. I don't think it is possible to legislate against risk without legislating against capitalism.

- There are many places in the world which currently have investment banking as an activity that relates to risk (e.g. UK, US, Singapore, Hong Kong) which seem to have moved beyond the crisis. While those countries do have other problems, on crucial measures like jobs and growth they are doing better than the eurozone. I don't think that the eurozone can (or should) insulate itself from the global financial system.

&gt; applying sound risk assesment/judgment is only possible, after all, if you don't have interests riding on the outcome

Here I think the opposite. I think one of the reasons for the crisis was that there was not enough of an alignment between risk and reward. Banks knew that they could take risks for which they would get rewards and then be bailed out when all went wrong. I also note that the whole direction of financial regulation in the last couple of years has actually tried to align risk and reward more closely - e.g. [all the new regulations on risk retention](https://www.eba.europa.eu/-/eba-publishes-final-draft-technical-standards-on-securitisation-retention-rules) or the new bail-in rules for investors.

Whether or not boring banking is desirable or not, I think you are swimming against the tide.[ I saw that in Juncker's letter to Hill, Juncker has specifically mandated Hill with deepening the capital markets union in Europe](http://ec.europa.eu/about/juncker-commission/docs/hill_en.pdf). In my mind there was nothing in that letter which indicated that Juncker wants a radical rehaul of eurozone regulation in the way you describe.

They claimed that, but this was a lie, because no plane flies at maximum altitude while dropping cargo. They said that because they wanted to implicate Russian air forces for destroying it.

And if not, while didn't they close the skies above the region for international airlines?

&gt;On 29 June, Russian news agencies reported that insurgents had gained access to a Buk missile system after having taken control of a Ukrainian air defence base (possibly the former location of the 156th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment [156 zrp] of the Ukrainian Air Force).[56][57][58] On the same day, the Donetsk People's Republic claimed possession of such a system in a since-deleted tweet.[57][59]

I don't see why wouldn't they use BUK to shoot down the cargo plane that is above 5km. 

&gt;This came from some unofficial, maybe faked social media groups which is unknown yet who is carrying them.

You seem to know it was fake. 

&gt;As I stated before and explained the reasons - they couldn't have had the system enabled monitoring the sky. Then only reason to turn it on (if they had one) would be to make the kill.

I meant that it has happened before in the history. MH17 is not the first civilian plane shot down. You seemed unable to comprehend the fact that civilian plane can be shot down by mistake. 

&gt;German intelligence report as it's stated in Der Spiegel stated that the plane was shot down by Ukrainian BUK which was in the rebels control. If you agree with that statement (with which I don't). That puts you in a quite difficult position. For example, explaining how they knew that the BUK system was under rebels control and not Ukrainian army, National Guard OR volunteer battalions who respond to noone.

I'm not disputing it no. I trust German intelligence more than Russian or Ukrainian claims in this case. But considering it with the rest of circumstances I tend to think it was much more probable that separatists shot the plane down. The fact that they admitted(which you think is conspiracy), the fact there was huge amount of videos and photos that pointed the direction, the fact how separatists behaved after the incident. And of course overall picture of Ukrainian conflict, Russian tactics, separatists ""style"" of things and I can't see Ukraine actually meddling in some conspiracy, as I tend not to believe in them a priory.

Additionally, the increase in the construction industry, and increased demand in the housing market generally will often lead to the 'costs to the tax payer' being recouped by economic growth. Additionally, additionally, usually have a budget which is based of their economy in several years time [so a budget larger than their tax revenue at the time would seem to allow] because government expenditure is largely (in the short term) financed through borrowing money, and repaying it when their economies have grown using the money. 

If it works as intended, it's really the perfect plan.

Honestly, I've seen plenty of people who has lived here for over 30 years but can speak almost no Swedish. Obviously the idiot in the video is probably not gonna get targeted, based on his Swedish alone. Most people who get targeted speak broken Swedish for instance.

The thing is the society is Swedish by culture. Swedish by culture doesn't mean skin colour. Swedish culture includes how well you speak Swedish and generally blend in. It also includes religion and behavior, such as ""varsegod, ni först"" (this is one of the things Astrid made a joke out of in Pippi Långstrump). People who are outside of the behavior, language, religion etc are people who the society, as a whole, doesn't quite accept. People who are outside of the society who wants to be in it thinks that people will adapt to them and not the way around. I've seen this first hand and it's getting annoying.

&gt; If the society doesn't see you as a citizen based on the color of your skin or your name how the fuck are you suppose to integrate?

These things, they take time. Swedes are generally white, so someone with a different skin colour will stand out. If you go to Japan you'll stand out, because you're white. If you've ever been there you'll see that you're like a person at the zoo. While it's annoying, it's not up to you to really scream about.

If you want a solution to the problem then it's to adapt as best as possible, learn the language, learn the culture, try to ""over-culture"" the population and be an overall asset to the society, rather the the opposite, an annoying moron who says none wants to be friends with him without realizing why and just screaming that it's because of the skin colour.

&gt; Despite it being ""logical"" it creates tons of animosity between people of immigrant heritage and the rest of Sweden.

Ohh please, there are plenty of immigrants who adapt just nicely to the society and people who doesn't. I have friends who come from different parts of the world but they chose to adapt to the society rather than the opposite, and I have known people who think they're the center of the universe.

What's your suggestion really? To check all people? To check Anders, Emil and Janne ""just because""? It's stupid and childish.

&gt; The point isn't that ""anyone can be illegal"" it is that targeting people by race will also include second and third generation swedes.

Because it wasn't above 5km, they claimed it to implicate Russian military for downing it. In reality it was transporter making a cargo drop way in the reach of the MANPADS.

If not, why didn't they close the skies for the airlines?

&gt;You seem to know it was fake.

Of course, because I watch official press realises on ANNA news and other sources where they film the rebel leaders directly. For example, Strelkov had only one official page at the time which he stated way back which is icorpus.ru - where all his comments went. Also he participated in a military reconstruction forum by the name of Kotov (Cat-ish). All other sources claiming to be him are obviously either fake or other people pretending to be him. Just like ikorpus.ru which collects donations by the way (clearly a fraud). 

And admitting all these social media as a source is precisely feeding conspiracy theories.

&gt;I meant that it has happened before in the history. MH17 is not the first civilian plane shot down. You seemed unable to comprehend the fact that civilian plane can be shot down by mistake.

I can comprehend it. I'm just implicating that there is no possibility for such mistake here. If rebels downed that plane it was surely because they were feed disinformation about this plane on purpose.

&gt;I tend to think it was much more probable that separatists shot the plane down.

Well that would be due to your own bias.

&gt;The fact that they admitted(which you think is conspiracy)

Conspiracy is thinking that everyone in the internet is the one who he claims to be.

&gt;the fact there was huge amount of videos and photos that pointed the direction, the fact how separatists behaved after the incident

Because Western Media made it look that way. Is much more suspicious that Ukrainian army tried to push themselves into that location at all costs (which caused them loses of hundreds of people) and tried to prevent the work of the specialists on the field.

In 1995 new tax on drivers was established in the Czech Republic, for use of highways. It was argued that the money will help to build more highways. Who could possible be against it?

In 1998 the tax was doubled, temporarily, because of floodings. The temporary turned out permanent and since then the tax is increased regularly. Now it is about 4x higher than in the 1995.

Since 2007 we have an electronic toll system from Austrian company Kapsch. The deal was so corrupt that most of the extracted money went to the company and rather little to the state. After 2016 the state plans to use some other, non-Kapsch system.

Et encore, je ne parle pas des maladies pulmonaires très liées au tabac mais non cancéreuses comme la BPCO.


&gt;De plus, le tabagisme est clairement un facteur d'augmentation du risque du cancer du poumon, mais comme, dans une certaine mesure, respirer l'air pollué de nos grandes villes, ou de nos usines. Pourtant lorsque quelqu'un fume et a un cancer du poumon, il est forcément attribué au tabagisme... Quand le personne ne fume pas, c'est pas de chance

Mouais, il n'empêche que même en étant sceptique on ne peut pas nier que plus de 80% des cancers du poumon se développe chez des patients fumeurs. A ce stade, ce n'est pas un facteur important parmi d'autre, c'est LE facteur premier, et avoir un cancer du poumon chez un non fumeur est effectivement de la malchance. Il faut également compter les victimes du tabagisme passif qui ne sont quasiment pas prises en compte dans les statistiques sur le tabac.


On a aussi tendance à sous-estimer grandement les effets du tabac sur les organes qui ne sont pas les poumons. Un exemple tout bête, la maladie de Crohn est corrélée au tabac, et c'est une maladie chronique qui coûte une blinde. On peut aussi parler des cancers ORL, des cancers de la vessie, des infarctus ou d'une masse de pathologie vasculaire. Il a au final pas mal de maladie chronique (les ALD, qui entraînent un remboursement des soins a 100% par la sécu) qui sont surreprésentées chez les tabagiques.

false,Athole,null,null,"So first, the reason it is ""more difficult"" for you to understand is what /u/YourMindsCreation and /u/hihrince both pointed out: your exposure to American language via media makes you ""used"" to hearing it. As a native American speaker, when I hear British, sometimes, it takes me a moment to get used to their differences... particularly if there are a bunch of regional dialects - most Brits do not speak ""Queen's English"", that is Received Pronunciation.... to the same credit, most of the German and Dutch I understand are fairly standard - if I speak to an Austrian or a Vlaanderen, I find it difficult.  
  
But, onto the question I found interesting:  
  
&gt; Isn't BE the ""original"" English? 
  
Sort of? Original English is Anglo-Saxon, and in all honesty, if we are going to talk about languages most similar to Anglo-Saxon, that would be Icelandic. Of course, that's just me being pedantic.  
  
The history of the phonology and orthography of English is a bit more complicated than ""In 1600 the English sent a bunch of people to Virginia and thus American English was born."" (Though, that had part to do with it)

From about 1350 to 1700ish the English language underwent a drastic evolution - called The Great Vowel Shift. Similar things occurred to Dutch and German around the same time. Why? Many reasons are suspected. Black death triggering relatively mass migrations, causing a merging of dialects, particularly in Southern England is a theory. The constant war and political upheavel of almost three and a half centuries on the British isles is another. Another possibility is that after the Norman conquest, ""French"" (Norman-French, Middle French) and also Latin were the lingua Franca, depending on the period of time, of the Aristocracy: the day to day business was done in a language other than English- with the Aristocracy slowly adapting to using English but a more ""refined"" version (compare 'Received Pronunciation' to any regional dialect in England). The theory I am most a fan of is that the change in Orthography due to the introduction of the printing press in the late 15th century caused the language to become more ""uniform"", and through a uniform othography came a more uniformed phonology. Anyway, the ultimate reason is *unknown* and probably not knowable, just by the sheer number of factors.  
  
But! What does this actually have to do with the quote I took from you?  
  
Well, as it happens, the colonials in America and Canada were not fully affected by this... for one reason or another. Orthographically this is one of the reasons we still use ""-or"" instead of ""-our"" - ""-or"" being the proper usage when deriving the word from Latin, ""-our"" being the proper usage when deriving the same word from French. ""-re"" and ""-er"" being another key difference, ""-re"" of course being derived from the French, but that spelling didn't become popular until the later part of the 17th century, ""-er"" being a far more common spelling prior to that, though both existed.  
This is just orthography - but American English retains the spelling of words more similarly to their original common spelling than British English.  
  
Accent wise, many more diphthongs are used in modern American English than in British. More commonly, the British will use /aɪ/ instead of /iː/ (for words like Either) ; the latter being the more common American pronunciation, and also the most archaic diphtong. /aʊ/ in British ""nous"" versus the more archaic American /uː/. Words now in British English that sound like /iː/ (that is p**ae**dophile or d**e**volution) are pronouced as /ɛ/ in American... and in English c.a. 1300.  
  
That being said, there are a great deal of British pronunciations that retain the archaic sounds, too, while the American one has evolved. So it's really a matter of nit picking and how much you want to be an elitist about it. The only thing that can truly be said for sure is American orthography tends to be more in line with later middle and early modern English than does British. As for pronunciation, it's give and take, and you can find what you want to support what you want: British archaisms as well as American archaisms exist in both languages. So, as I said way back in the beginning... ""sort of?""

Also, I didn't mean to imply that I'm the only person to ever have lived in both countries at once; but your response seemed to not be informed by what middle class life in America is like, so I assumed your experience wasn't extensive, if there was any.

&gt; In spite of your reliance on personal anecdotes you have yet to show me any evidence.

Then please review my previous post again; plus, pretty much everything I said can be confirmed by a quick Google search. The problem is that you keep comparing apples and oranges, and despite evidence to the contrary, keep insisting they're one and the same. You cannot compare income without also comparing cost of living; Zurich and London, for example, offer great pay, but cost of living in both cities is through the roof, too. And in America, there are plenty of things that you have to pay for yourself that in Germany (and most other European countries) are paid through taxes.

More sources:

[Here is a report on the costs of childcare in America](http://usa.childcareaware.org/sites/default/files/cost_of_care_2013_103113_0.pdf). You pay a fraction of that in Germany, largely because daycare is heavily subsidized these days (unsurprisingly, the cost without subsidies isn't much different).

In general, the percentage of [out of pocket expenditures for social spending](http://www.oecd.org/social/expenditure.htm) is much higher in the US than in Germany (that includes not only healthcare, but also pensions and other things), and net social spending in both countries is actually pretty close. The out of pocket expenses don't even include loss of income; after all, everything you get when having a baby in the US is a maximum of 12 weeks of unpaid leave per the Family and Medical Leave Act, during which you have to support yourself out of your savings or your spouse's income, whereas almost everywhere else in the developed world, you get paid parental leave.

Annual health care expenditures per capita were $8,508 per capita in the US, $4,495 in Germany (adjusted for purchasing power, [2011 numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_%28PPP%29_per_capita)). A friend of mine had a baby a couple of years ago; her out of pocket costs were something like $2,000, not counting the loss of income (no paid maternity leave). Post-ACA, the most popular plans on the exchanges have still been silver plans, which cover 70% of the expected actuarial costs of healthcare, usually because of high deductibles and copays.

My alma mater, Michigan State University, a decent but hardly elite university, charges [$13,246 a year](http://admissions.msu.edu/finances/tuition.asp) for in-state tuition alone, amounting to over $50k in tuition for an undergraduate degree (of course, cost of living expenses are extra). Pretty typical, too. The cheapest universities that you can still expect to grant a credible degree run to around $9,000 a year in tuition fees. And yes, having an undergraduate degree is much more of a necessity in modern America, due to the lack of vocational training opportunities that are both good and credentialed.

Incidentally, the gap in *gross household income* or median wages appears to be primarily due to [Germans working far fewer hours](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-18868704) – the ratio of hours worked is pretty close to the income ratio. The real scandal here is that in Germany, it's [usually still the wife who is working part time or becomes a stay-at-home mom](http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/raus-aus-dem-beruf-jede-dritte-mutter-bleibt-zu-hause-a-567341.html), a state of affairs that is still encouraged by conservative politicians. If you want that to stop, you will have to take it up with the CSU. Of course, the upside is that it is nice that you can make a living without both parents having to work full time, rather than requiring two full incomes just to make ends meet. And, of course, parenting isn't accounted for in a country's GDP.",0,1413995584,null,0,false,0,clgnx6n,t3_2ju9sd,t1_clgnx6n,t1_clghov3,null,1426404199,0,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,0

It would require 27 of the 28 EU countries (ie all the EU states, minus the one who is being suspended) to agree that Hungary should be suspended. However, once suspension has took place, it would only require a majority of countries to decide what sanctions should be placed on Hungary, leaving slightly more room for manoeuvre. 

If Hungary keeps going in this direction, then it's gonna have to happen sometime.

For the sake of the EU's (already faltering) image, it would probably make sense for the EU to wait as long as possible before taking this measure, to ensure that there is absolutely no ambiguity as to their necessity. At the moment, most people aren't aware how bad the situation in Hungary is becoming, but also the situation probably isn't unambiguously bad enough. Hungary might not be up to the standards we'd expect, but it's also not really that much worse than some members either. The gulf would need to be undeniably large before we could start taking action. 

So with that in mind, I hope they keep pushing forward with their autocratic reforms and what's more, speed them up.

The young student lives in a small town not far from the airport -- and he filmed the three-day-long battle day and night. From rooftops and from the street, he shot images of Ilyushins landing at the airport to send more mercenaries into the battle. Though wobbly, one from last Saturday shows a Libyan fighter jet roaring over Bayda -- and one can clearly see the jet dropping a bomb not far from the airport.

one example from the article

&gt;One of the more serious incidents occurred in June 2014, when the new[44] leader of the Imarat Kavkaz, Emir Ebu Muhammed, slighted Musa Abu Yusuf al-Shishani (a/k/a Umar al-Shishani) in an online video.[45]  Al-Shishani, a/k/a Tarkhan Batirashvili, is an ethnic Chechen from Georgia's Pankisi Valley and is thought to be the military commander of the group Islamic State.[46]  Shishani's followers quickly retaliated, branding as apostates[47] any who are not part of the Islamic State and advising Ebu Muhammed “to stay there in the Caucasus and eat leaves.”  As one analysis put it:

""Thus, the initiative of the new Caucasus Emirate’s emir, which could have resulted in achieving some form of reconciliation between the different factions of the North Caucasus militants, ended up having the opposite effect and only heightened tensions among the groups. As a result of this development, the ISIS accusation that other militants are apostates will only make reconciliation between ISIS and the other North Caucasus rebel groups nearly impossible. This is the first—and a very important strategic blunder—by the emir of the Caucasus Emirate since he was elected to his new position this past spring.""

Not the government - euromaidan cyber-centurias most likely.

Why that one? Should I remember that the plane was flying at civilian flight speed and altitude, which very few cargo transporters can even use. That there were dozens of civilians planes flying above the region. Why on earth that one?

&gt;Western media is plural and there are heaps of actual journalism.

Western media is biased in this case, same way was about the conflict in Syria in first stages, when Assad was the bad dictator and the rebels were paragon of freedom and liberty.

Also very few have operatives in there, like Vice News. Others just reposts whatever their Ukrainian colleges send them. There is a very good channel on youtube from Анатолий Шарий who is Ukrainian journalist and who lives in exile - he reviews most of the notable news fakes.

false,Supergiovane,lombardia,,"1) Spanish is a bit less phonetic. ""c"", ""z"" and ""s"" (or ""c"" and ""z"" in Castillan Spanish) have the same sound. The same applies to ""b"" and ""v"". I know that it's not such a big deal, but it's still worth mentioning. If you go to Youtube and look for a song with lyrics on Youtube, you will be shocked by the amount of native speakers who misspell words with these letters. 

2) Spanish is spoken with a faster pace. Spanish people can usually recognize Italian speakers because, even when they speak Spanish at very high level, they still tend to overemphasize vowels. 

3) The subjunctive in Spanish is used more than in Italian. Subjunctive is the hardest grammar element for English speakers to get a grasp on. Consider that while in most Spanish-speaking countries subjunctive is used 100% correctly even by the least educated people, in Italy only educated people can master it well enough and its usage is slowly getting lost. It's not a big deal to get subjunctive wrong in Italian, the majority of native speakers does it as well, but in Spanish it's crucial to master it.

On the other hand, Italian has a disadvantage in the regional differences. It's so much easier to understand a Colombian if you study Spanish in Spain than to understand someone with his everyday language in Southern Italy when you learn Italian in Milan.

Also, there are some tricky grammar elements (foreigners usually tell me about the usage of ""ci"") that are not a problem in Spanish. 

I know several English speakers who can move between Spanish and Italian very well. The logic and lexic are very similar. It might be a bit confusing in the beginning, as it's natural to mix the two languages, but I think that studying them at the same time is beneficial to both.

Pretty much like austerity. But with austerity, you get a population that will be increasingly angry with the corrupt government, and will eventually become more watchful, and kick out corrupt politicians.

In the north, we are more stable not because of some ""magic"", but because the people care more about governmental abuse. 

Hell, in Germany we kicked out our president, only because there were *hints* that he could have helped a friend 20 years ago. He had to resign. Turns out he didn't do anything. But better have one innocent politician resign than having a corrupt politician in power. 

What happens in the south? In Italy they re-elected Berlusconi countless times. Its not a coincidence that the south is in such a bad state. 

The people don't do their homework. That has to change if you want the south as stable as the north, and long-term prosperity in the south as well.

No, it's hard to say whether 17th century English would sound more American or more British. But it would probably sound like neither. Neither is an original. It sort of pisses me off actually how Shakespeare plays are usually done in an British accent since it perpetuates this idea. 

It's actually the same with Harry Potter. Because the publishing industry is crazy, JK Rowling had a British and an American editor, she sent her manuscript to both, and both edited it a bit differently.

false,barsoap,SCHL,Sleswig-Holsteen,"&gt;  Germany is currently enjoying subsidized exports thanks to a euro that is weaker than a Deutsche Mark would be. 

Germany isn't enjoying exports, it's hooked to them. It's the only way to keep our unemployment figures still cookable: While the actual number of unemployed *looks* good on paper, about 25% get handouts because their wage, by far, doesn't suffice. Even more are entitled to. We're too fucking productive, and non-productive, non-export jobs don't pay enough. The economy is pretty much saturated, and raising inland consumption couldn't ever make up for cutting exports. We're literally giving stuff away to others so that we still have something to do.

Either we accept that -- and just actually give stuff away, without expecting people to pay up, past the imports we actually need (which, when it comes down to it, is raw materials, coffee, tea, bananas and spices, the rest we can do ourself or can replace) -- or we say goodbye to the employment rate as a thing to keep down at all costs, see basic income or such.

You won't see anyone talking about that, though. And the Euro, btw, is harder and stronger than the Deutsche Mark ever was. The thing is: People don't stop buying factories and tunnel bore machines just because the Euro is strong. They buy German stuff because there's tons of small and middle-sized companies who are the world leader in their particular niche.

Yes. What do you imply?

&gt;Means they were part of gov. conspiracy to shoot down the plane.

No they just generate information noise that is most beneficial for Ukraine at least how they think. Verification and facts have no meaning for them. It is a patriotism... in a way.

You can learn more about it if you visit inforesist.org - pure propaganda in the interests of the nation. Sadly somewhat low quality, but Western Press luckily reposts only the most high quality unverifiable data. 

&gt;Assad is dictator.

He is elected president.

&gt;And there are very different type of rebels(at least in the beginning)

Just like in all other Arab Spring movements - Westerners are shown those 2% hipsters and human rights activists of the revolutionists. Just like on the Russian channel 24 (Vesti) - around 10% of the Euromaidan who were Nazis are shown so much time that people end up thinking that most of those who were there are indeed Nazis. Propaganda but from different angles. 

&gt;I think professional army has less of a chance of making that sort of mistake.(not impossible of course, as we see examples in history).

I'm still affirming that there is no chance for such mistake from the rebels since they couldn't have had the system enabled all the time, only for periods of 5 minutes tops from different locations (if they had one).",0,1414000732,null,0,false,0,clgqtqw,t3_2jz26e,t1_clgqtqw,t1_clgq6j1,null,1426402844,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

false,HJonGoldrake,EURO,EU migrant,"&gt; And the Euro, btw, is harder and stronger than the Deutsche Mark ever was.

It doesn't make sense to compare the strength of the euro in 2014 and that of the Deutsche Mark of the pre-euro era, because the boundary conditions are different. We should rather ask: if Germany returned to the Mark in 2014, would it appreciate or depreciate against a euro-sans-Germany? what about against new national currencies of France or Italy?

This sort of counterfactual is impossible to prove, of course, but most people would think that the Mark would appreciate relative to those other currencies, making German exports comparatively less competitive. The other countries, on the other hand, would enjoy a weaker currency, making their exports more competitive.

This is what is meant when we say that the euro is too weak for Germany and too strong for many others. This is the advantage that Germany has from the euro: it can keep a weaker currency without having to depreciate it through monetary policy, which would cause inflation.

&gt; The thing is: People don't stop buying factories and tunnel bore machines just because the Euro is strong.

Of course they don't stop, which furter reinforces the idea: Germany currently has a weaker currency than would be 'natural' (in the sense described above) given the demand for its products. The weaker currency that Germany enjoys is not what enables it to export, it's what enables it to export this much and *this competitively with respect to other eurozone states*.",0,1414001958,null,0,false,0,clgrj00,t3_2jz90h,t1_clgrj00,t1_clgqt5e,null,1426402518,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Of course, but we are speaking about the AN26 - which was downed over it's cargo drop zone. So it was clearly either in the process of dropping cargo or descending/climbing back to normal flight altitude (which takes quite some time).

&gt;Then on the day of shooting down MH17 Kiev makes them say ""we shot down cargo plane"" within minutes of the incident.

Just like the ""Spanish Air Traffic Controller"" - if you consider those accounts genuine so is his - and he clearly stated that MH17 was downed by Ukrainian air forces. Also within minutes of the incident, also with long previous history of posting as an air traffic controller in Borispol.

If there is such a thing, it would probably be Oxford English, based on dialects spoken by Oxford students generations ago (at a time when Oxford and Cambridge universities were essentially educating the next generation of the ruling classes).

Well that part really doesn't matter. Point is the size of the overall demand stimulus, its perfectly fine whoever takes it. 

As to how its to be profitable, if it isn't profitable to the private sector now - EIB is pretty much specialized in doing things like this. Various instruments can achieve this, but boils down to the public sector taking part off of the risk of the investment, or the initial risky say R&amp;D expenses, etc , so the project is more attractive to the private investor. For eg, project bonds and mezzanine loans are forms of this. 

If they can mobilise 300beuros that wouldn't be invested or spent otherwise, it achieves the same economic goals regardless of the private/public makeup of it.

It discourages citizens from challenging their government when they believe it is doing something wrong. 

A small news company or individual would essentially be priced out of making the same request due to the potential they would have to pay the ECB's litigation costs, which I am sure were not cheap. That rule really needs to be changed for government party litigation. ",0,1414004484,null,0,false,0,clgszkd,t3_2jz90h,t1_clgszkd,t1_clghlhh,null,1426401837,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Other Eurozone countries don't even sell tunnel boring machines. In the lower-range segment, for easier projects, there's competition from the US, Canada and Japan, and even from within Germany, but if you need to do something serious, you can't get past Herrenknecht. They'll get that tunnel drilled, no matter what, and you'll be glad to have spent a bit more for the security that that bloody tunnel actually gets drilled... not to mention on time and budget. Companies capable of drilling such beasts like the Gotthard base tunnel aren't exactly common.

Such factors are completely independent from currency exchange rates. And Germany has a *lot* of hidden champions.

That's not to say that there's no competition, at all. Of course, say, Moulinex competes with, say, Bosch. VW with Renault. But excessive exports are much more sparse in those sectors than in the specialised machinery one, as, you know, there's actual competition.

And, as I already said: Economically, we don't even *want* to export that bloody much. It's insanity, we can't run a surplus in perpetuity... though it's comforting that we have one with China.

Munich has better day trip options (lots of them have been mentioned already, plus there's Salzburg in Austria).  Until about a hundred years ago, Berlin used to be lots of different smaller cities, and in terms of area, is almost 350 square miles.  

Munich is good in terms of getting out into nature and enjoying some history.  Berlin is good in terms of history, art/ architecture/ literature, and is more of an intercultural melting pot. 

If costs matter, Berlin is often cheaper than Prague, Budapest, etc.  Berlin is walkable, but because it's so big, it's often better to just take the subway.  There's a famous anecdote that Berlin is ""poor but sexy.""  In contrast, Munich is one of the most expensive cities in Germany, if not the most expensive city.

I think you are opening a pendora box here.

To simplify, let say first that Islam in France is really divided, depending the original country of the Muslims (Algerians together as for Tunisians, Marrocan, Turkish, Black muslims, ...). I think it might be different compare to Germany where (for what I know) Muslims are for a big majority from Turkey.

Thus, it may also be divided considering the city they live in France. You don't see the same things if you are in Lyon, Paris, Lille ....

That said, it exist a ""fashion"" of showing to every one that ""you are more muslim than other muslims"" by those days (and remember that France is a laic extremist country so it is already realy rare to see someone giving you a christian bible in the street). It can take many forms. We can see the ""salafist style"" but also the some girls with pretty dresses with a pretty veil, so it can takes many forms.  

Also, they is no such ""official"" and watchable organisation here (exept for Tarik Ramadan). What you had describe exist but it is hidden and linked with ""gangs"". For sure we can see it sometimes but it is really rare (and those who do that are arrested).

Justement, selon moi, il aurait du (voulu?) le dire, mais vis-a-vis de la loi c'est trop délicat. Je me prend alors le droit de le dire a sa place, avec, en soutien, les citations suivantes:

*rapport de la Mission interministérielle d'inspection du logement social publié en 2010: … de nombreuses irrégularités ont été constatées dans le processus d'attribution des logements … Seules 17,4% des personnes hébergées dans les HLM de Puteaux touchent une aide au logement contre une moyenne nationale de …*

*texte du voeu repoussé par les élus UMP de Puteux: … le conseil municipal encourage les élus résidant en HLM et disposant d'un niveau de revenus suffisant pour accéder au marché privé, à renoncer volontairement à leurs logements sociaux, afin que ceux-ci soient attribués à des familles prioritaires …*

*En octobre 2005, dans une interview à l'Express Charles Ceccaldi revendiquait sa politique … ""(..) avec 5 600 logements sociaux, l'office HLM de la ville est l'une des clefs de voûte du système. Ceccaldi-Raynaud le contrôle depuis quarante-cinq ans! Inutile de préciser que ses employés sont des fidèles et que les familles qui y sont logées votent souvent en faveur de «Monsieur Ceccaldi». L'heureux locataire devient alors, presque mécaniquement, un obligé du maire. …""*

Touche final: les faites ne sont pas contesté - seul le faite de les avoir comptabilisé et publié l'est.

Si Mr. Grébert est relaxé, je modifie mon post en acceptant humblement que c'était abusif.

Mais, ""ce sont des élus de la République qui gèrent l'argent public... et qui contrôlent l'attribution des logements sociaux. Ils sont juges et parties !""

L'argent du contribuables n'est pas une caisse noire pour la quel les élus sont dispensé de rendre des comptes (des rares exceptions sont en a débattre).

*1 élu sur 2 de la majorité municipale est en HLM, 0 élu de l'opposition et 6.000 familles en attente*, dans les faits, peut ont vraiment dire que c'est en fonction du besoin et pas en fonction de partie pris?

About the vocabulary, I'm a strong advocate of comic books. Not many people know about this, but Italy has a strong tradition in this field: I found on Wikipedia that 75% of the Disney comics are produced by Italians. A comic book like Mickey Mouse (highly recommended, but you can ask advices about more mature ones should you prefer) will give you a perfect mix between written and spoken language. You might be skeptical, but comic books helped me learn Finnish more than classes and books combined. It's more fun than trying to decypher proper books and gives visual clues that will help your memory.

&gt;___The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia___ is a 1974 [utopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopian) [science fiction novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_novel) by [Ursula K. Le Guin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin), set in the same [fictional universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe) as that of *[The Left Hand of Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness)* (the [Hainish Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainish_Cycle)). The book won the [Nebula Award for Best Novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_Award_for_Best_Novel) in 1974,  won both the [Hugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award) and [Locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_Award) Awards in 1975,  and received a nomination for the [John W. Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Campbell) Memorial Award in 1975.  It achieved a degree of literary recognition unusual for science fiction works due to its exploration of many ideas and themes, including anarchism and revolutionary societies, capitalism, individualism and collectivism, and the [Sapir–Whorf hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir%E2%80%93Whorf_hypothesis).

The US is socially (as in legal system and social structure) probably closest to the UK if a European nation had to be picked. 

Culturally we're a complete amalgamation of European influences that have morphed into our own. There really is no parallel. 

Ancestrally we're *mostly* German/Italian/Irish for people with European ancestry.

Reading up on the history of New Orleans in the early/mid 1800s when the flood of Americans came to NO to settle after the purchase really sheds light on the matter. Also, there has always been a lingering feeling of inferiority from the US in regards to our culture and it was very apparent even in the early 1800s. 200 years ago. Many of the passages from then apply now. There were prominent French Creoles that refused to rent to Americans and the Americans had to settle in what is now the business district. The architectural stylings are quite evident even when compared to buildings of the same age that the Creoles built. Very spartan. Plain. 

And after going to New Orleans multiple times I've sparked conversations with Europeans that visit there. They've all iterated it's a ""uniquely European city"" in the US even though its age is really not much different than Charleston/Savannah or other well-preserved American cities from the late 1600s/early 1700s.

false,rewboss,advanced,advanced,"&gt; Is 'enough-to-get-by' German sufficient to raise a child bilingually

Short answer: No.

Not that you can't teach your child German, but if you're the only one teaching German to the child, their German is never going to be better than yours. Unless you happen to be living in Germany, in which case your child will be exposed to enough Germany by the time puberty sets in.

Your best shot at having a bilingual child would be to marry a German; you then only speak English to your child, your spouse only German. That way, your child stands an excellent chance of having two native languages, which is what bilingualism is. If you try only speaking German, you will be limited by your own German, meaning you'll have difficulty communicating effectively.

Speaking English most of the time but *teaching* a little German, you could do that if your child enjoys it. It won't do any harm, and may even do some good -- it just won't result in a bilingual child.",0,1414010458,null,0,false,0,clgwjd6,t3_2k0ulj,t1_clgwjd6,t3_2k0ulj,null,1426400050,9,false,German,t5_2qq51,9

Purple prose is sensually evocative beyond the requirements of its context. It may also employ certain rhetorical effects such as exaggerated [sentiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling) or [pathos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathos) in an attempt to manipulate a reader's response.

&gt;When it is limited to certain passages, they may be termed __purple patches__ or __purple passages__; these are often noted as standing out from the rest of the work.

And that's where it's getting interesting. Usually that's when the hugely entangled European history comes to bear. And this would also include large swaths of Russia, of course, even so geographically and also ethnically much of it is just far away. But Russia is definitely inseparably entangled with Europe through history, if it likes it or not.

The other thing that I hear is Christianity/Scholastics/Renaissance/Enlightenment. And I think that's the best way to tackle this complex. These traditions of thinking have lead to a culture that contours the idea of Europe best. Maybe together with the French revolution/the '48 revolutions.

Can some of South Africa can be said to have European culture? Maybe. What about Argentinia? It certainly feels the most European of all the South American countries, but they have definitely their very own culture that just intersects heavily with European traditions (Evita Peron). Then it gets already spread thin: Canada?! Even in the francophone regions I wouldn't say so. Australia/New Zealand? Nope, imo. That's definitely something else down there.

That works if the parents are right most of the time, but if the parents get a rule consistently wrong, the child will never learn the correct rule. This natural error-correction can itself lead to new errors: this is called ""hypercorrection"", and is the reason some children go through a phase of saying ""runned"" and ""foots"". Children have to know when to apply the rules and when not to.

But while a child might intuitively pick up on grammar rules in this way and correctly apply them even when they are imperfectly taught, that doesn't mean that communication will be any easier. It simply means that the German the child has learned will be grammatically slightly more consistent.

I would also caution against this:

&gt; I think this might lead to them acquiring some few quirks where they copy my mistakes

Bear in mind that mistakes, once learned in this way, are nearly impossible to unlearn, the cut-off usually being somewhere around puberty.

&gt;Again, I'm not arguing that the actions of such military powers can't act in a way that inflicts emotional trauma on the civilians it claims are terrorists or combatants or collateral damage.

false,Supergiovane,lombardia,,"This happens with all the languages. When you're a kid, you learn to speak your mothertongue by imitating with your muscles the sounds you hear from other people (mainly your parents and your friends). People then tend to associate these noises with letters, so an English person will associate ""t"" with the sound they have learned and italians will associate ""t"" with their own sound. In reality, the muscle movements slightly differ between languages (and also between local areas inside the same country). You will always learn a new language through the influence of your mothertongue. 

I can give you some examples: the ""t"" in English in the beginning of the words sounds like it has a ""puff"", while in italian it doesn't. The ""r"" is rolled in Italian, Spanish and Finnish, but if you pay close attention they sound slightly different: Latin Americans (except with ""rr"" and in the beginning of a word) have the weakest, Finnish has the strongest. Finnish has two a's, ""a"" and ""ä"": neither of them is pronounced like the italian ""a"" if you pay close attention. ""a"" is deeper and ""ä"" is pronounced like the a in ""cat"". Russians pronounce ""l"" moving the innermost part of the tongue, while Italians move the tip.

Also, double consonants. Both Italian and Finnish have them. If you pay attention, a double consonant in these cases is nothing more than a quick pause before pronouncing the letter. However, Finns do a slightly longer pause, so, to a very attentive ear, they sound a bit different.

All those complexities in the muscle movements are very hard to assimilate properly because they are usually neglected while learning a language. Italians tend to sound very similar when speaking foreign languages and Americans tend do to the same: an American with heavy accent makes the same ""mistakes"" when speaking both Italian and Spanish.

The only way to correct your accent (if you think it's worth) is to pay more attention to the sounds and try to imitate them. Many people don't want to imitate other accents because it sounds wrong to their brains and not natural. You will also notice that speakers who pay attention to their pronounciation tend to ""change their voice"" when swapping between languages.

I'm awful at explaining, but I hope I solved your doubt.

TL;DR it happens with all languages. You learn to move your muscles based on the people around you when you're very young.   ",0,1414016597,null,0,false,0,clgzux1,t3_2k023l,t1_clgzux1,t1_clgyo9a,null,1426398501,6,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,6

 Radical Islam (or whatever you want to call it) is like a cancer grown out of traditional Islam. You think it's religion but it's politics. It's all about power, disguised behind spiritual words.

Think about all those people : poor, uneducated, suffering from social injustice and contempt or imagining it. 

And then they are the so-called ""jihadists"", who offer them a social position, power, adventure and conquest. If you are a kind of a psychopath and don't mind killing some people for it, it's a great deal.

I know the Luberon valley well.  I lived there on and off for a few years.  If you want to see the classic lavender landscapes, then you need to visit late June and July.  

There are several villages I can recommend.  

Gordes:  Probably the most famous in the area.  Gets very touristy in summer.  Market day on Tuesdays.  Parking can be very difficult.  Nearby is Abbey de Senanque.  
 
Loumarin:  Great atmosphere. Worth visiting. Great market on Fridays.  Get there early to find parking.  

Roussillon:  Interesting landscape.  Village is pretty.  
 
Menerbes:  Small hilltop village.  Used in an episode of the British sitcom Absolutely Fabulous.  Has undergone a revamp in recent years.  

Fontain-de-Vaucluse:  Village set on the river and below mountain.  Really very pretty.  Quite small.  

L'isle-sur-la-Sorge:  Town set on the river with various bridges crossing the water. Has a famous antiques market.  The town centre itself is OK, worth a visit, but not to linger really.  

Bonnieux:  Hilltop village with great views of the valley.  The village itself is a bit so-so. Makes a good place for lunch if you want a view.  Nearby is the village of Lacoste, which in my opinion is not worth visiting at all.  

Saignon: Tiny village above Apt.  Often overlooked.  Worth a drive there.  

Cucoron:  One of my favourites.  Also overlooked.  Really wonderful to visit late spring and summer to sit at a restaurant by the great water bath/fountain.  The village itself is also nice, but not as scenic as other places.  

Apt:  More a place to pass through rather than to linger.  

Saint-Saturnin-les-Apt:  pretty village, but not much there.  You can walk to the top of the hill to get a good view of the valley.  

Goult:  I didn't find Goult to appealing.  It was OK, but not really worth going there, unless you want a lunch break.  

There are other smaller villages as well that I didn't mention.  That is because they hold little of interest for a first time tourist.  

Moving out of the countryside and into bigger places, I would also recommend visiting:  

Avignon:  Avignon makes a great base.  It is a small city and you can see it in a day (or less, depending on your interests).  

Aix-en-Provence:  worth a visit.  

Arles:   A must visit place.   

Nîmes:  I really like Nîmes.  It has quite a bit on offer for a tourist.  The gardens at the top end of town are lovely.  

Saint-Remy-de-Provence:  Scenic town, very popular in summer.  

Note that for the smaller places, you will need a car.  Buses are irregular and many places non-existant.  

Provence stretches a bit further east and south as well, so you might want to look at a map to see which bit you would like to focus on for your trip.  

I can't help with hotels.  I've never stayed in a hotel in the area.  

Vineyards:  I have visited a few near Bonnieux and Menerbes.  I'm not a wine expert, and I don't know wine farms well enough to recommend any in particular.

&gt;Noone always gets a 100% when so many interests come together, surely you can't expect that.

But that's sort of the crux of the issue. Most typical conservative Eurosceptics in the UK tend to believe that not getting 100% of what you or your citizens want represents a tangible loss of control over your own policy in favour of non-UK interests which they see as undemocratic. They would say that while you may suffer some economic damage to begin with at least the fundamental tenet of democracy is preserved namely that UK people (not other EU politicians) have ultimate authority over UK policy (via representatives). 

Now it's pretty hard to argue against that: its certainly true that if you leave the EU you would get 100% of what you want because there would be no other interests to compete against. It's also true that these conservative types genuinely honestly don't see themselves as European and never have. One subtle element of conservatism in the UK has always been the belief that the nation state is the proper level of ultimate governmental organisation - international solidarity was always more of a Trotskyist socialist belief that conservatives opposed. When you see the world that way where the only legitimate authority for any nation is it's national governing body then international law becomes impossible to accept. Especially where so long as that international law is in place, as with free movement of workers, the national parliament is not allowed to change it without leaving the organisation. If a government is not allowed to change an aspect of policy because an international organisation says you can't it's difficult to argue that that hasn't taken quite considerable power from the national government which is unacceptable to nation state focused conservative philosophy. In other words it's not the immigrants it's the fact that we can't control immigration even if 100% of us wanted to specifically because an illegitimate (to them) international organisation forbids it.

Now I think many people see that it is a slightly hypocritical argument too because any international organisation from NATO to the UN to the WTO inherently means coming to international compromises and taking into account what other countries want. Every trade deal you sign is negotiated with the government of that country and will involve making compromises. The only way you could ever secure total sovereignty over policy would be if you withdrew from international affairs completely like North Korea. However when it is as wide ranging as the EU people see the results first hand unlike with NATO or the WTO (and if fed the right mixture of misinformation and scary half-truths by certain newspapers) people will feel like they know enough and will decide to reject it not least because they don't understand it and the fact that the EU makes little to effort to make itself understood to the public. Which EU politician is willing to come to the UK and explain why free movement of workers is needed? Are they willing to go on TV, have a debate, be interviewed etc etc? This very rarely happens and when it does it's often dismissive of Eurosceptics as crazy people which just makes them angry. Farage gets more airtime than Van Rompuy, Schultz, Barroso and Junker put together because he goes out there and tries to speak to people and persuade them unlike any EU representatives who are largely unknown and not respected. How can you agree with someone whose never attempted to persuade you of anything? If they can't do that for all 500 million people then maybe that highlights a flaw in the system - too few representatives for too many people.  

Either way, UKIP has tried to fuse that conservative ideology with the concerns of working people by blaming high house prices, low wages, pressure on social housing and medicine on low-skilled immigrants and suggesting that the reason we can't solve that problem is because our government is not allowed to change it's own immigration policy. The claims about low wage pressure are marginally credible but the other claims have been debunked but only by academic sources; not common reading material among Farage's target demographic. Once you convince people they have someone to blame for their difficult circumstances they are hard to persuade otherwise and all you have to do is turn people to the EU and say 'That's the real problem' and people attack it. When they ask politicians whether it's true that we can't control our policies on intra-EU immigration the politicians have to awkwardly answer yes which seems to lend credibility to the whole argument when in fact it does nothing to prove that immigrants (while they are free to come) are the cause of people's problems but the confirmation bias keeps people believing. 

Combine that with the fact that the current crop of UK politicians are about as unpopular as they can be and are not trusted at all following numerous foreign policy mistakes in Iraq and Afghanistan and a major new political scandal every year since 2000 [\(fraudulent expenses, accepting money for influence or official office, being influenced by media magnates etc\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_scandals_in_the_United_Kingdom) (seriously, we've had a new one every year for 15 years) people are happy to vote for someone who's not a brushed aluminium, former-public relations cyber prick like David Cameron so they can shake things up and cause politicians to stop assuming a clever sound bite will persuade/trick people.  

All that has created the current UKIP. It's still possible for the UKIP vote to disappear at the national elections in which case things might go back to the way things were but people won't be happy. Otherwise the EU will dominate UK politics for the next 3 years until we have a referendum on membership.

false,Latvis,LATV,Latvia,"If you've read the journal articles and publications, you probably know that non-citizen status affects people in several quite specific ways - inability to vote in elections and to take certain jobs in the public sector. That's basically it, oh and the inability to stay longer than 90 days in the rest of the EU without a visa.

But in day-to-day life, speaking as a citizen, I don't think it affects people very much at all. You don't know who is a citizen and who isn't, there are no indicators. There are factors that make it more likely - the person in question being older and Russian-speaking increases the possibility that he or she is a non-citizen - but my default assumption is that the people around me are citizens of Latvia (I live in Riga).

Generally in everyday life there is no ethnic tension or conflict whatsoever. There might be isolated incidents, but it (arguments or conflict on the basis of ethnicity or language) really doesn't happen much at all. The two linguistic communities aren't that much divided, anyway - all the ethnic Russians that I have interacted with in the last few years have understood Latvian at the least, but the majority of them have also been able to speak it.

Then there are the young mongrels, the Latvian kids with Russian parents or children of mixed marriages. Again, the vast majority of them speak Latvian just fine, even if they do have a strong (or weak) accent and make grammatical mistakes.

Ethnic Latvians, educated ethnic Latvians especially, are generally not very forgiving of people who speak Latvian in a ""clumsy"", grammatically-incorrect, and/or Russian-influenced manner. Much less forgiving and tolerant, say, than Americans who speak ""proper"" English but accept that many African-Americans speak in their own certain dialect/ebonics/whatever you want to call it. But again - in everyday life that's not much of an issue, rather something that comes up in the wider discourse - discontent of ethnic Latvians when minority people don't learn Latvian, but also certain discontent when the minority person speaking Latvian ""butchers"" it.

Riga is split 50/50 between Latvians and Russians, and not a small number of people working in the government bureaucracy (all of which is based in Riga) are people whose native tongue is Russian, or who are bilingual from birth. So I think there isn't any kind of serious discrimination by government workers themselves against Russian-speakers, although the policy of the country is, of course, that there is one national language that the bureaucrats are to use.

But practical considerations often win out.

At the same time, I study in uni, and just today I heard a girl speaking to the librarian (a youngish woman) in Russian. The librarian, instead of switching to and answering in Russian as might have been the case 10 years ago, steadfastly answered in Latvian. And that's alright. Because the girl was a young student, higher education is only in Latvian anyway, and she surely understood the language.

&gt;__New Mexican cuisine__ is the [regional cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_cuisine) of the US state of [New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico). Part of the broader [Southwestern cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_the_Southwestern_United_States), New Mexico [food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food) culture is a fusion of [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Spain) and [Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_cuisine), [Mexican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Mexico), [Pueblo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo) [Native American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States), and [Cowboy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy) [Chuckwagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuckwagon) influences.  ""New Mexican food is not the same as [Mexican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_cuisine) and [Tex-Mex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tex-Mex)"" foods preferred in [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas) and [Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona).  New Mexico is the only state with an official question—""Red or green?""—referring to the choice of red or green chile.  Combining both red and green chile is often referred to as ""Christmas"".

In honesty, if you want someone to be representative of Europe to Britain, ditch Barroso, bring someone more conciliatory. 

The Big 3 found out to their surprise when the Yes campaign was making gains, they realised that maybe scoffing at the thought of Scottish Independence was a bit of a shit idea. So they changed tack and started being a bit nicer (we're still waiting on those devolution powers!)

I bet if there will be a Brexit, Brussels' stance will definitely^hopefully change, if it wants to keep Britain in.

A prescindere dal merito, quello che fai seguire a questa frase non è in nessun senso il contrario di 'paccottiglia nazionalpopolare'.

&gt; ma a confronto con ciò che esprime la politica italiana da 40 anni [...] sembra il più grande degli statisti

Davvero? cosa ha fatto per meritarsi questo illustre titolo, seppure per confronto?

Ha risollevato il paese dal declino economico? no, il declino perdura e i pochi provvedimenti di politica economica sono stati inefficaci.

Ha messo il paese almeno sulla strada della ripresa? no, la crisi non accenna a frenare, né si sono fatte grandi riforme di cui aspettarsi i frutti.

Ha dato all'Italia nuova autorevolezza internazionale? no, l'Italia continua a dover sottoporre la propria politica economica all'umiliante vaglio di Bruxelles e Berlino.

Ha riformato lo stato per svecchiarlo e snellirlo? no, le riforme istituzionali sono ancora in fase embrionale

Insomma, che ha fatto Renzi? a parte gli annunci, oltre gli slogan, oltre le leggi delega, cosa ha fatto?

Ha fatto gli €80, ottima idea pessima esecuzione. Ha preso il 41% alle Europee: benissimo, ma vincere con grandi maggioranze l'ha fatto pure Berlusconi, quindi in questo non può essere Renzi uno statista e quell'altro no.

Quindi, dimmi, che ha fatto Renzi?

Perché a me pare che non abbia fatto nulla, nulla di sostanziale, certo ha fatto qualcosina ma praticamente ogni governo ha fatto qualcosina, anche il fragilissimo Prodi 2006-2008. Rispetto anche solo ai governi di questo millennio, Renzi non ha combinato nulla: Berlusconi ha fatto riforme enormi (la Gelmini per dirne una sola), Prodi ha fatto le liberalizzazioni, Monti ha fatto la riforma Fornero, Letta ha fatto lo sblocco dei pagamenti dei debiti della PA.

Fatih Akin maybe. 

Contemporary culture otoh is of course influenced by turkish people. Be it Fatih Cevikoglu or some other comedian. Or turkish rappers or whatever.

In regards to contemporary ""Kultur"" ... there's propably a proportional or rather less amount of turkish influence in there, I suspect. In my neighbourhood there's a turkish theater to which I went twice in like 10 years. Just 5 minutes walk, I'm lazy. There may be others in the city which I don't know about. 

Like I said, Fatih Akin's movies are possibly the most well known examples that'd qualify for being ""high culture"". I am not that well versed, there maybe some authors of turkish origin or composers or something.

Now that I've come to think about it, all those turkish rappers would be ""Kultur"" since they make music. But then again it's popular music which is not really part of ""Kultur"". ",0,1414023364,null,0,1414024880,0,clh330u,t3_2jzp88,t1_clh330u,t1_clgyt93,null,1426396996,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Though you can't actually enter Karabakh through Azerbaijan, and have to go through Armenia (and will be denied entry to Azerbaijan if you've ever visited Karabakh), its still de jure Azerbaijani territory.

Considering that it is largely blocked off and near a not-so-active frontline, its a real neat place to visit. Stepanakert, the capital, is considerably modern under the circumstances, and has a nice large park with free Wi-Fi; all the young folk sit there for hours on their phones or laptops using it.

Agdam is mentioned elsewhere here, and I'll agree, with caveats. For those that don't know, it was a major city before the war, and was consequently totally destroyed. Its now sometimes called the Hiroshima of the Caucasus, and looks just like it; rubble everywhere. But there is a 1870's Persian mosque still largely intact that you can visit, and just looking around the ruins makes for a unique experience.

However, it is illegal for foreigners to visit Agdam, and the Armenians have a military camp set up within site of the mosque, as it is only a couple kilometres from the front, and there are landmines in the area. I was there back in April, and while the soldiers were friendly, being teenage conscripts serving their mandatory service, evidently their commanding officer was not so much. On our way back to Stepanakert we were caught by the police, and detained for a couple hours. They wanted to know why we were there; fortunately we didn't speak Russian (the lingua franca of Armenia and Karabakh), and they didn't know English, nor was their translator very good at it.

The question though is whether I speak to the child in a third language and let the grandparents and surroundings teach them English (we live  in an English speaking country). 

One thing language advocates point out is that your own knowledge of the target language grows along with your child. An  children learn a lot from peers as well - so if you were to make friends with families of German speaking kids and be able to send your kid to a German preschool and school it would help a lot. It's not enough just for you to speak to them, they need input from elsewhere to keep them motivated and give them well-rounded skills. In my case I would probably be helping to revive a language - Maori - so there is an extra incentive to keep our culture alive. People here in NZ have raised kids in Maori when it isn't their native language, but the successful cases that come out actually able to speak and use the language go through schooling in Maori, have friends and family who speak it and their parents use it as the primary home language. There is a whole community to support the endeadvour, and imho that is what you would need to create.

You got me wrong, there is nothing to excuse, just explanation. Collapse of the USSR is major factors for everything: depopulation, reduced life length, high mortality rates. Demographical waves are show pretty clear echo of ww2, and disasters of collapse of USSR. 

During 90x people kicked out from relatively safe and comfortable USSR into wild stages of primitive accumulation of capital. People didn't receive payments for months, banditism and murders was common, i remember how in my relatively calm hometown someone set up hand grenade into under business guy car and when his wife tried to drive it detonated but luckily failed to kill anyone instead just broke few windows glasses, this happened on parking near house i lived. No fucking money, even savings was lost due to collapse of financial system. After i moved into St.Peterburg i heard so much scary stories about what's happened in Moscow in St.Petersburg during 90x, sometimes criminals shot each other with AKs just on streets. Police was really dangerous work, in St.Petersburg young thugs sometimes kill policeman just to grab his gun.

And government gave some land to each to grow vegetables to eat during winter. I spend every weekends helping family on ""dacha"" for many years.

And what surprised you? That in that hell many drink cheap shitty booze take drugs, commit suicides, enter into crime and died? I'm worry that this will be repeated in Ukraine now.

killing and wounding civilians. ISIL and associated armed groups also continued to systematically perpetrate
targeted assassinations and abductions, including community, political, and religious leaders, government
employees, education professionals, journalists, and health workers.

...

&gt; **In the case of attacks targeting diverse ethnic and religious
communities, these appear to have been deliberately and systematically perpetrated with the intention of
suppressing these communities or cleansing them permanently from areas under ISIL control**, or in some
instances of destroying some communities.

It was around two hours total if I remember (the bulk being from Paris to Caen), and it wasn't too expensive. I was with family so as the impromptu translator I spoke with a ticketing person to get what we needed; if you only speak English they'll still help you out, it's just polite to speak some or at least use the go-to ""Parlez-vous franglais?""
 
When we arrived at the Bayeux station, we went to a house sort of building across the street from the station. It's got a small café and they do tours as well; if I remember correctly there is advertising for tours on the building. We walked in and booked a tour right there for somewhere around 30-50 Euros a person, but I believe the gentleman was being especially nice and giving all of us a youth rate. You go in a small van, so your tour group is not even ten people, and the guide drives you to all the beaches, cemeteries, and everything. It's also worthwhile to walk around Bayeux and see the cathedral if you have some time to kill before your tour. We also went and saw the Bayeux tapestry. I can't say you're guaranteed to be able to reserve on the spot, but it worked for my friend who recommended it to me and it worked for me and my family. It was also so much cheaper and seemed a lot more personal.

I realised where our differences lie. You don't realise, that it's *hurtful*, when I hear others lumping me in with groups I don't support or believe in. That I happen to be from the US, and that I somehow am grouped in with the stupidest shit that happens in my country. I figured out what to call it - the lowest common denominator perception. And when I hear people talking about the US talking about 'anti-vaxxers' or whatever, its hurtful. 

And you don't seem to realise that. 

Which is somehow strange, because that is probably the reaction that Germans have when people call them natzis online when totally unwarranted - which I'm sure hurts on some level to! But that's what you guys do with your language about the US. 

You told me that I'm reading too much into what you wrote, but I would say no. From your perspective, you just wrote what you wrote and that's it, end of story. But from my perspective, you're like another post on top of like hundreds that I've read on reddit in the last year and a half or so, which carried this blase language about the US. Talking about 'evolution deniers' and 'antivaxxers'. It's similar as if I just casually refer to Germany as 'having been full of Nazis', or something to that extent, and then carry on with what I had been talking about. 

I mean, really, you guys over here in Europe paint a picture of the US  that's just bollocks.
