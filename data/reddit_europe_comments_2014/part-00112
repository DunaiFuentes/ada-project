true,johannL,null,null,"Ich benutze seit einer Weile Faustwaffen ohne Unterbrechung, sie sind unglaublich gut. Aber mein Problem ist folgendes: Ich weiß von Caestus, Krallen, mißgebildeten Krallen, und Manikin-Krallen. Die einzigen davon, die ich nicht habe, sind ein Paar plus zehn Normal-Krallen. Und dennoch, bei einer Stärke von 50 und einer Fingerfertigkeit von 36, deplazieren die Caestus alles! Sie skalieren wie wilde Tiere und das ist kühl, aber ich denke, dass die schwerer erhältlichen, selteneren, spätspieligeren, VERFICKT KLINGIGEN Waffen so viel mehr Schaden anrichten sollten. Es ist sehr frustrierend bis NG4 rumaskesen zu müssen bis für ein paar verdammte Manikin-Krallen, nur um sich in der Situation wiederzufinden, dass sie weniger Schaden anrichten als die Caestus. Ich fühle mich, als ob die Hierarchie ein bißchen merkwürdig ist. Mein Freund benutzt einen profanen Bau, und für ihn sind die Manikin-Krallen besser. Aber auf einem anständigen, plus zehn Normal-Bau, vermöbeln Lederfäuste die Riesenkrallen. Wirkt halt merkwürdig, und nervt ein bißchen. Ende der Beschwerde.

**Edit:**

Ich glaub Ich abe verstanden, was du meinst.

Wenn in einigen Sprachräumen ""halt"" wie ""heit"" gesprochen wird, dann kann folgende Situation entstehen:

""Deutsch ist halt *(heit)* eine ziemlich komplizierte Sprache.""

halt = nunmal, eben

Würdest du das übersetzen mit ""German is *like* a quite complicated language."" , wäre das nicht unbedingt richtig.

Zurückübersetzt würde das nämlich so viel heißen wie: ""Deutsch ist schon so etwas wie eine ziemlich komplizierte Sprache.""

Ich wüsste kein Wort, das die Bedeutung des Wortes ""halt"" in derartigen Satzkonstruktionen im Englischen 1:1 übersetzt.

Der Satz würde in Englisch richtig übersetzt vielleicht so viel heißen wie ""German is just a complicated language.""

tl:dr

Wenn du das ""halt""/*""heit""* meinst, dann gibt es wohl keine universelle  Übersetzung dafür.

I know you are actually sensible. But on the other hand, it's funny how Europe is still tiptoeing around these issues while the opponent is pretty straight forward and brutal. In that sense US is so much better dealing with this kind of countries(be it bad or good thing).
 Russia and Europe just speak different language. Europe is like a Ned Flanders from Simpsons and Russia is a Nietzschean character who doesn't mind using brute force to get the upper hand. I don't know, maybe one day EU will adapt to Russia's tactics, but without US Europe is pretty wimpy right now.

Les féministes qui amènent le sujet du harcèlement de rue sont souvent proches d'une forme de ""marxisme culturel"" qui voient le monde comme une pyramide de privilèges qui s'additionnent, où culmine l'homme ""de souche"" hétérosexuel de CSP+. (Il y'a heureusement des courants féministes qui ne partagent pas ces gros présupposés idéologiques).

Dans ces mouvements anti-sexistes, anti-racistes, anti-homophobie et anti beaucoup de choses, le rêve ultime serait un front uni mêlant le précaire, l'homo, l'Arabe et la femme pour briser ""l'oppression"" insupportable exercée contre les ""minorités"".

Oui, sauf que dans la vraie vie les lourdingues qui insultent les femmes dans la rue (OK, sauf DSK j'imagine) sont rarement des grands patrons ou autres personnes d'influence. On parle avant tout de jeunes hommes de classe moyenne basse qui globalement sont bien plus mal lotis dans la vie que les femmes qu'ils harcèlent. Et souvent c'est juste des racailles, comme tu remarques.

Mais comme ce sont des vérités délicates à traiter (surtout si on amène l'origine ethnique de beaucoup de ces mecs dans le débat, qui est le non-dit ultime de l'intelligentsia française) et que ça ne rentre pas directement dans les schémas idéologiques de ces féministes, on préfère amalgamer le comportement de tous les hommes (la ""masculinité toxique"" et le ""patriarcat"") plutôt que pointer du doigt les quelques cons facilement identifiables qui en sont réellement responsables.",0,1398016983,null,0,1398017898,0,cgxfs1c,t3_23iq06,t1_cgxfs1c,t1_cgxeoa6,null,1433441602,17,false,france,t5_2qhjz,17

No lying. I just remembered it differently. However, it's wouldn't have been out of repertoire for Banderovtsy to do something like this.

I do know what ""авtолюбитель"" main. Yes, it is a very quaint Soviet term and it personally makes me cringe a little and smile every time that I hear it used these days. Vladimir Vladimirovich probably had the same reaction.

No boots on the grounds - Spotters, trainers and Qatari special forces who actually fought with the rebels.

Airstrikes would be to protect civilians - Airstrikes happened on any Libyan government military or command installtion whether on the frontline or not. Whether they were taking part in the war or not. Meanwhile rebels who were attacking and murdering civilians were ignored. NATO watched and provided close airsupport to rebels when they were pummeling pro-government cities and districts with grad rockets. NATO did nothing has civilians and suspected gaddafi supporters were kidnapped, tortured and murdered. Hell NATO did nothing when Misratans and Zintani rebels ethnically cleansed several villages.

No fly zone - Nobody was supposed to fly airplanes expect for NATO. NATO changed that to allowing the rebels to fly airplanes. This allowed them to move around fighters and weapons to different regions.

Arms embargo - Any attempt by the government to buy weapons were stopped. No attempt was made to stop rebels from reciving weapons shipment. Only Turkey at one point early on stopped arms shipment but they relented to the pressure and the inevitable. In fact France and Qatar supplied weapons.

Fuel embargo - The government wasn't allowed to sell oil or buy any fuel. The rebels had help from Qatar to sell their oil and get shipments of refined fuel.

That ""all necessary measures"" was used by the US to explain why they were violating everything else. It went against the spirit of the resolution and what they openly said at the beginning. They only used it when it became obvious what they were doing was what they said they wouldn't do.

Einige meiner Freunde und Bekannten behaupten, dass mein Mittelinitial fuer ""Kontroverse"" stehen wuerde.
 
Rosenberg vertritt einen interessanten Ansatz. Vieles, was er lehrt erkenne ich aus der Soziologie (Peace and Conflict Studies) wieder. Allerdings finde ich, dass er mit dem Ausformulieren der Gefuehle etwas ueber Bord geht, das klingt dann doch sehr gestelzt.
 
In den PCS gibt es aber vergleichbare Ansaetze, wie z.B. Hart zum Problem zu sein, aber nicht zum Menschen. In den Problemen, die uns zu trennen zu scheinen, den gemeinsamen Boden suchen, etc. Das alles ist mir sehr vertraut.
 
Respekt ist natuerlich das Fundament jeder Gemeinschaft, und genau darauf zielte auch meine Kritik ab: viele sogenannte Gemeinschaften, von der Freundschaft bis zum Verein oder der Interessengruppe, sind heute nur noch Zweckbuendnisse oder dienen der Unterhaltung.
 
Werte, die Respekt ausdruecken, fuehren in unserer Spassgesellschaft leider ein kuemmerliches Dasein. Werte, wie: Zuverlaessigkeit, Loyalitaet, Solidaritaet, Mitgefuehl, usw. Leider sehe ich dieses Fundament auch in den religioesen Gemeinschaften immmer weniger. Das ist eine Entwicklung, die mich ziemlich traurig macht.

Das ist es, was ich auf meine holprige Weise ausdruecken wollte. :-)

Quand on vit dans un monde violent et impitoyable, de rencontres musclées avec la police, de chômage, de rejet généralisé, de l'échec scolaire et professionnel, quand on ne peut même pas avoir accès pour des raisons d'argent et de race, aux lieux de sociabilité où la drague est acceptable, le harcèlement de rue devient un moyen d'amener sur la place publique une revendication, d'une prétention au modèle qui nous est vendu par la culture dominante. C'est bien les plus hauts cadres, les personnes d'influence, les experts en marketing qui construisent et perpétue ce modèle au jour le jour et c'est difficile de reprocher grand chose à des mendiants par comparaison.

1. A couple of days ago, Ukrainian MSM reported that their spetsnaz had recaptured two of the armored vehicles which were ""captured by the separatists"" earlier. Two things false about this:

a. The vehicles were not ""captured"", but were handed over by Ukrainian soldiers who didn't want to fight their own people and have either switched sides or disbanded.

b. The glorious Ukrainian spetsnaz never recaptured any of them, because the very next day the ""separatists"" paraded all six vehicles, still ""safely"" in their possession. 

2. Early last week, the Ukranianian MSM reported that their glorious army had ""fought off"" an ""armed separatist attack"" against their base in Mariupol, killing one ""separatist"", wounding three and capturing sixty.

In reality, multiple pieces video evidence shows that the Ukrainian troops opened fire on a crowd of unarmed protesters who were gathered at the base's gate. They didn't even have sticks, much less firearms.

Both pieces of propaganda was picked up by the Western MSM and reported in the same manner as the Ukrainians reported it, without questioning.

They have also been caught producing many fake videos, such as the one where a ""Russian colonel"" is instructing the ""separatists"". The colonel in the video was later identified as a two bit alcoholic actor.

Also, every few days, an article from Kiev Post or somethings, supposedly once-and-for-all proving that the Russians are controlling things on the ground in Eastern Ukraine, makes it to the top of /r/worldnews 

They have all been subsequently discredited.

Any way, the point is, the very same top Western PR firms who won the propaganda war for Tbilisi in 2008, are currently spinning things for Kiev. Russia is still terrible at propaganda compared to those spin-masters.

Le problème quand tu dis des choses comme ça, c'est qu'un ethnologue alien qui nous lirait penserait que les femmes occidentales du XXIème siècle vivent sous un joug tyrannique ultra-patriarcal et que tous les mecs se croient permis d'exiger une partie de jambes en l'air avec une inconnue. 

Dans ma vie au quotidien, la plupart des jeunes hommes que je rencontre sont respectueux des femmes et souvent galants au point de donner des passe-droits aux femmes qu'ils ne donneraient pas aux autres hommes. Quand je regarde ma propre vie, j'ai été élevé par des femmes (à l'école, à la maison) et rien ou presque de ce que j'ai vu à la télé ou autour de moi n'était de nature à faire de moi un super-macho. Je ne suis pas le seul dans ce cas. Il faut tenir compte des énormes changements sociétaux plutôt que de citer des recherches sociologiques qui sont obsolètes depuis les années 80.

&gt; C'est bien les cadres, les personnes d'influence, les experts en marketing qui construisent et perpétue ce modèle au jour le jour et c'est difficile de reprocher à des mendiants une culpabilité possible.

Ces mêmes cadres en marketing qui te vendent une pub pour la bière avec des nanas en bikini sont les mêmes qui font des pubs pour la lessive qui jouent sur le stéréotype du mari gentil mais incompétent face à sa femme pleine de bon sens. Ils ciblent certains groupes sociaux et font de leur mieux pour véhiculer les valeurs potentiellement associés à ces groupes, rien de plus.

They are planning on increasing their bilateral trade to $100 billion. 

The only serious change in their economic relationship came during the civil war. The west and the Arab countries placed sanctions on Syria. Iran and Russia have filled in the gap. They have also both signed deals to reconstruct Syria after the war. So their investments and trade will increase but that happened after all the vetos and when it became clear that Assad wasn't going to be toppled.

Mais pour ne pas rentrer dans des détails sans fin, et car je ne m'y connais pas plus que ça, les images d'adolescentes anorexiques, le culte d'une perfection inatteignable et de la beauté comme d'une denrée périssable contribuent sans aucun doute à reléguer les femmes au rang d'objet. Quant aux noirs et aux arabes ( ou lol les Roms ), ils en sont exclus sauf à véhiculer des images de délinquance et d'insécurité ambiante.

*Politics*

* [The biggest parties \(Fidesz, Jobbik, LMP and the three members of the former Leftist Alliance\) met the minimum signatory limit to run at the EP elections](http://www.politics.hu/20140419/five-parties-party-alliances-registered-to-run-for-ep-elections/). The deadline is Tuesday, but it's quite unlikely that others will join them. Naturally [everyone is expecting wonders from themselves](http://www.politics.hu/20140414/fidesz-expects-10-12-mandates-40-turnout/) and failure from everyone else. We have a total of 21 mandates plus 5 ethnic minority representative spots. Because of the people's low interest in this, [Jobbik might overperform](http://www.politics.hu/20140416/jobbik-seeks-to-strengthen-representation-in-ep/) and snatch 1 or 2 extra places on top of their current 3 mandates, while the left is expected to perform relatively badly. In case of a significant flop for the Socialist Party (= placing 3rd) party president Attila Mesterházy might face removal. The share was 14-4-3 for Fidesz, Socialists and the radicals in the past term.

* [Fidesz doesn't like that the Norwegian Development Fund aided some NGOs with ties to the green party \(LMP\)](http://www.politics.hu/20140414/minister-of-pms-office-criticizes-biased-distribution-of-norwegian-development-funds/) and requested the Norwegian government to seek their *opinion* (read: approval) prior to funding civil projects in Hungary. This is especially hilarious in light of how half of the Fidesz election campaign was channelled through a very politically motivated, very Fidesz-friendly NGO. The Norwegian project funds are in the range of 7-70k Euros, whereas CÖF, the shadow NGO, has likely spent many millions of Euros on campaigning behind the cozy option of not needing to disclose their expenses with the public.

* Since elections are over, Jobbik is back at what they are great: criticizing everyone without control. From this week's interviews:
 * [Only we can protect the Hungarian lands](http://www.politics.hu/20140415/only-jobbik-can-guarantee-protection-of-hungarian-arable-land-says-lawmaker/), everyone else will sell it to the evil foreigners who'll molest virgins on it. 

 * [The Socialist Party is doomed to fail, why do they even exist and why can't we have their votes instead?](http://www.politics.hu/20140414/socialists-incapable-of-renewal-says-jobbik/) 

 * [The Ministry of Development \(responsible for handing out all grants and subsidies\) is controlled by shadow entrepreneurs](http://www.politics.hu/20140414/development-ministry-under-control-of-offshore-knights-says-jobbik/) who store their money in offshore accounts.

 * In reference to the [smallest leftist party's approval](http://www.politics.hu/20140414/long-term-plans-for-united-states-of-europe-says-gyurcsany/) towards the former, they said that [the approach to create a United States of Europe out of EU is unacceptable, they support the ""Europe of nations"" vision](http://www.politics.hu/20140414/jobbik-calls-united-states-of-europe-absurd/). 

* New cabinet: Minister of Agriculture Sándor Fazekas remains for the new term, [Minister of Justice will be former Ambassador to France](http://www.politics.hu/20140417/hungarian-ambassador-to-france-to-be-new-justice-minister-says-martonyi/)

* [A hall in the European Parliament will be named after deceased Socialist PM Gyula Horn](http://www.politics.hu/20140416/eu-parliament-names-hall-after-horn/) to the protest of right-wing Hungarian EP members.

* More drama with the German Occupation monument. 

---
*Economy*

* [We have a 24 billion Euro surplus from the 2007-2014 funding period](http://www.politics.hu/20140415/hungary-receives-24-billion-euros-in-eu-funds-between-2007-2013/), which makes us the 3rd most benefiting country in the EU behind Poland and Greece. 

* [Douwe Egberts is closing their factory in the country](http://www.politics.hu/20140414/douwe-egberts-closes-factory/). 

* [After the arbitration court retroactively cancelled a trolley bus tender](http://www.politics.hu/20140414/court-cancels-trolley-bus-tender/), we might lose the 99% EU-funded deal to purchase 24 new trolley buses for Budapest due to very close deadlines. 

* [Fidesz ain't giving up on our tax-free pálinka!](http://www.politics.hu/20140414/fidesz-insists-on-free-palinka-distillation/) Hungary stronk, EU doesn't matter, [even if they act otherwise](http://www.politics.hu/20140416/brussels-moves-forward-with-infringement-procedures-against-hungary/).

*Misc.*

* A ""celebrity"" mountaineering figure is attempting to climb Mt. Everest. For the 8th time. He is a bit of a joke in the Hungarian mountaineering community, as he tried and failed to summit countless of peaks with many very fake sounding excuses (he did not summit any 8000er, although tried 10+ times on numerous mountains, including the ""easiest"" Cho Oyu), but managed to capitalize on the media exposure greatly. With the death of Hungary's best mountaineer, Zsolt Erőss last year on Kangchenjunga (on descent with a prosthetic leg), he's even more in the spotlights now as we have no viable, media-friendly candidate to step in Erőss's boots. 

* [The new 3000+ seats football stadium \('Pancho Arena'](http://index.hu/galeria/index/belfold/2014/04/17/lassanak_csodat/)) will open tomorrow in Orbán's home village, literally steps away from his house. [In case anyone still wonders whether history repeats itself or not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Olt_Scornice%C5%9Fti), upon opening the place to journalists, many spotted a VIP suite titled ""Prime Minister's Office"", but [they later stated they did not purchase or rent it](http://www.politics.hu/20140418/pmo-has-no-suite-in-sports-venues/), the stadium builders addressed it as it is on their own since Orbán will likely be a frequent guest at games. An U17 tournament is under way, the final between Real Madrid and Budapest Honvéd (coincidentally the two teams of legendary footballer Ferenc Puskás, whose nickname the stadium bears) is the maiden game of the place.

* The grave of archbishop Asztrik, the priest who brought the first crown for the country's first king, Stephen I, was located in the crypts of the cathedral of Kalocsa. Until now the tomb was believed to belong to another clergyman who lived 200 years later, but carbon-isotope analysis proved that belief to be wrong. 

* Our border control officers are of exceptionally high standings, their bribe rate was 5€ to forgo customs check on vehicles. Or food and drinks. [Now 10 of them are caught.](http://www.politics.hu/20140418/border-control-officers-taken-into-custody-on-bribe-charges/) 

* The Division I Group A ice hockey world championship started in Seoul with the Hungarian team present. On the first game today we beat the hosts and overall we are expected to be 3rd or 4th, we don't really have a chance to be promoted. However fingers are crossed since the last and only time we were, the Div I championship was in Asia too.

true,jeanralph,ZBSVUE,U-E,"Merci pour les précisions. Je comprends mieux ta position et je partage certains points.

Là où je ne suis plus d'accord, c'est sur la cohérence du marxo-féminisme (je te pique l'expression, j'ai toujours utilisé marxisme culturel mais c'est trop vague), qui nécessite du coup de conclure que les directeurs commerciaux manipulent les jeunes de banlieue pour être cohérente. Le lien entre les deux groupes me paraît plus que ténu, et à un niveau très fondamental je ne pense pas que les aspirations matérialistes dépendent de la volonté des marketeurs. 

Oui, je vois bien que la forme de la culture bling bling ghetto sort tout droit d'une version défigurée et exagérée du mode de vie des gens riches qui est vendu par le marketing. Mais je pense que sur le fond, aspirer à un accès aux femmes + au statut social d'au-dessus et tenter de se démarquer comme on peut est un phénomène universel pour les jeunes hommes, aucunement limité aux a priori potentiellement sexistes des cadres en communication de nos sociétés.

&gt;  les images d'adolescentes anorexiques, le culte d'une perfection inatteignable et de la beauté comme d'une denrée périssable contribuent sans aucun doute à reléguer les femmes au rang d'objet.

Oui, mais comme souvent quand je discute de ça avec quelqu'un qui défend la position féministe (ou en tout cas sa cohérence), les problèmes spécifiques aux hommes/garçons ne sont pas mentionnés ce qui laisse penser par omission que les femmes font l'objet d'un traitement particulièrement et uniquement défavorable.

&gt;

&gt;__Polish Plumber__ ([French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): *le plombier polonais*, [Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language): *polski hydraulik*) was a phrase first used by [Philippe Val](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Val) in [Charlie Hebdo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hebdo) and popularised by [Philippe de Villiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_de_Villiers) as a symbol of cheap labour coming from [Central Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe) as a result of the [Directive on services in the internal market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_services_in_the_internal_market) during the [EU Constitution referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_referendum_on_the_European_Constitution) in [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) in 2005.

&gt;The phrase became well known after [Frits Bolkestein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frits_Bolkestein), the creator of the Directive, noted during a press conference that he would like to hire a Polish plumber because he found it hard to find a good handyman for his second house in northern France. The proclamation caused considerable controversy and debate in France. The mayor of the [village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village) in which Bolkestein resided gave him a list of available plumbers he found in the [phone book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pages_Jaunes).

&gt;The phrase was then the origin of a controversy during the [EU Constitution referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_referendum_on_the_European_Constitution) concerning the motivations of opponents to the treaty. Some supporters assumed opposition to the treaty was due to nationalist considerations, others considered it was used to discredit them.

Ludwigshafen is Mannheim's neighboring city. (It's basically New Jersey to Mannheim's New York)There's not much going on there but rent is a good deal cheaper. Public transportation is pretty well-developed within Mannheim and between both cities. So that might be a way to save some money if you don't mind the commute (around 15-20 minutes not including waiting for the tram or bus from city center to city center)

As for student housing or shared flats you might try
http://www.studentenwerk-mannheim.de/International.html
and www.wg-gesucht.de (a German shared housing portal)

Nice neighborhoods for students are Schwetzingerstadt, Oststadt, Innenstadt (city center), Jungbusch (the latter is more run-down and has lots of people with immigration backgrounds but it's close to the center and has a healthy and trendy bar scene).

Cell Phone Carrier:
I use O2 personally and I'm quite satisfied. However, if you want the very best coverage, you can't do better than T-Mobile (but it's pricy).

Places to eat:
Plenty. We have all the usual fast food chains. There's lots of Kebab/Döner places, nearly none of which are bad and most of which are tasty (City Döner directly at the main station is a personal favorite). There's not really any special local food, just the usual German meals (you can basically get Schnitzel in almost any restaurant).

The *Vienna* is a very popular pub/restaurant for students, since the meals are very cheap and served well into the night (kitchen closes at 1am iirc).

On the subject of food, I recommend buying ingedients and cooking yourself. I heard that in the US, fast food can be cheaper than buying fresh ingedients. That's mostly not the case in Germany. We have lots of cheap supermarkets. For example, a pound of pasta, tomatoes and ground beef will only cost you around 6-7€ and that's good for four servings.

Alright, those are my rambling, incomplete and awkwardly structured tips, hope you get something out of them.

true,modomario,BELG,Belgium - Flanders,"Here we just take the highschool exams each trimester in combination with grades during the year and maybe some other activities like internship the combinanation of which decides if we succeed then we're allowed to go to the next year, a different course in the next or same year depending on what said course encompasses and the deliberation (I think).  When passing the final year and done you go a college or university of your choosing. There you take what course you want (though most following something similar to what they chose in high-school) and it's roughly the same. 

Do you guys not specify a study you want to go for during high-school and just follow a core program similar to the American system?

edit: I should add that within the different courses (I don't even know if courses is the correct word) there are a few in BSO which allow you to take half time education in the last or 2 last years of highschool.
These are however considered to be courses focused on employment right after highschool (building and such) and are by many considered to be among the more easy. 

Oh I mentioned BSO so I should probably mention that the courses are categorised though they've been considering to do away with that.

ASO: Is general secundary education.      
Has stuff like things like latin, latin-greek, moderene, economics, moderne-economics, moderne-sports,...

TSO: Is technical .....
Has the largest number of courses as far I'm aware.
Ranging from Technic sciences, engineerschiences, chemistry focused courses, biology focused courses...
to trade, opthics, toerism, maritime, informatics education and so on.

KSO: is art....
Contains every possible direction in art.

BSO: is proffesional....
This focuses on courses that allow people to quit after highschool though they can specialize and continue.

As you progress trough the years some of the more specialised and unique courses tend become available whilst at the start it's the most popular and general ones. 

There are about 150 different courses overall I believe.
Each has a roughly specified curriculum.

For example I went for applied informatics in TSO and got things ranging from programming to subnetting and whatnot. The things you get in a different school that gives this course may not be exactly the same but still contains those things.

The downside of this system though is that you may have to switch schools if you switch course.
I for example did technical sciences first with an eye on an engineering education in a different municipality (there was one in mine but it was roughly as far away) but then switched to informatics and could follow that in my own. Another downsides is that kids have to choose that early and they can still switch mid course but that might cost them a year and they can still choose something completely different in college/university but that may also be rather difficult.

Damn wall of text. Our education system is as complicated as the country I guess.

edit2: Note that these tons of different courses mostly contain a few similar core items though they often have less hours then the main subjects of the course they are still studied.

Par contre là où je suis complètement en désaccord, c'est de croire qu'en **2014**, dans un monde couvert d'écran où les plus grosses nouvelles capitalisations boursières sont des géants du marketing, la perception des discours ne précède pas la formation du désir et des aspirations. 

Concrètement les mécanismes publicitaires sont ceux d'un renforcement pathologique des pulsions irrationnelles ( qui mènent à la décision, elle aussi irrationnelle, d'achat ). Le désir sexuel étant une des formes premières de pulsion ( l'influence de la psychanalyse freudienne est très présente dans le monde de la pub ), il est évident qu'à chaque fois qu'on vend des pâtes, un iphone, on utilise sciemment le lexique d'un possession quasi-sexuelle. On pourrait probablement avoir de bonnes corrélation la libido des gens en fonction de leur sensibilité à la pub. 

&gt; Mais je pense que sur le fond, aspirer à un accès aux femmes + au statut social d'au-dessus et tenter de se démarquer comme on peut est un phénomène universel pour les jeunes hommes, aucunement limité aux a priori potentiellement sexistes des cadres en communication de nos sociétés.

Oui, ça a toujours existé. C'est là où l'on voit la nécessité de la pensée marxienne pour le féminisme. C'est à dire la vision historicisante de ces phénomènes. J'ai pris l'exemple de la pub car il me semble le plus actuel, autrefois le relais de la vision patriarcale était la religion ou la propagande d'Etat. Je pense à l'enlèvement des Sabines qui illustre le besoin de cimenter le pouvoir par la conquête des femmes. L'universalité que tu invoques est celle de ces tentatives de contrôle plus que celles des individus. La femme est un objet au service des aspirations et cette transmission se fait par le biais de ceux qui ont la main mise sur le discours. Et il ne faut pas se laisser aspirer par un pseudo-pragmatisme tout à fait sexiste ( c'est normal de vouloir posséder une femme pour le statut social et faire des gosses ). 

&gt;les problèmes spécifiques aux hommes/garçons ne sont pas mentionnés ce qui laisse penser par omission que les femmes font l'objet d'un traitement particulièrement et uniquement défavorable.

Je comprends ta vue, et en même temps je ne la comprends pas. On n'est pas obligé d'enlever aux autres pour avoir une revendication. Mais certains constats me paraissent tellement évidents que dire qu'ils sont partiaux à cause de ça, c'est faire un procès d'intention. 

&gt;L'existence même de ce ""modèle culturel dominant"" comme rejeton de la société de consommation me paraît problématique à démontrer

Je ne crois pas. La démonstration est assez simple. D'où le consensus quasi-unanime de tout le spectre politique malgré des désaccords dans l'explication des causes, structuralistes ou naturalistes, dans les effets, acceptables ou inacceptables, et dans la possibilité ou la désirabilité de changer le modèle. 

&gt;J'irais jusqu'à dire que la société de consommation a amélioré le sort des femmes bien plus qu'autre chose.

On peut avoir une telle vision, mais on se place autant dans l'idéologie et dans la croyance envers la main invisible de la société libre et sans entraves.

Enfin, certe le nucléaire n'est pas si catastrophique que ça niveau écologique. admettons que les accidents n'arrivent qu'aux autres (comme dit mon pote alpiniste *les cimetières sont pleins de gens qui ne tombent pas* ) Il n’empêche qu'il va falloir commencer la transition énergétique  et que vu qu'il y en a pour 50 ans (je m'inspire des chiffres données par l'association Negawatt) il faudrait peut être commencé par encourager les économies d’énergies et les énergies renouvelables, comment faisaient ceux qui nous ont précédé, comment feront ceux qui nous succéderont ?

And if you didn't know what I'm talking about why did you critisize me so harshly anyways?

What I'm saying is:

Israel is annexing territories of nations who *do not* want to destroy/annihilate Israel, partly by justifying it with the apparent thread of other close by nations. Or even worse: By justifying it with religious belief and this bullcrap.
There sure are Palestines who *hate* Israel, but that's for a reason. For the same reason many Russians, Afghans &amp; Iraqi hate the US.

Israel is one of the most opressive religious states in this world, which is an obvious example of why to not mix state and church. It has been taken to the extreme that you need to be jewish in order to immigrate there. Really? Every other nation would be accused of discrimination.
Israel is not just an ""island"" whithin the middle-east's arrea. It has become a mere colony of a big brother who cannot morally afford to critisize Israel's actions, nor to cut the ties.

Israel could bring wealth and peace to the region. Instead it brings disharmony and denies help to those who need it.

Generations of people decay and age with no reason to live, with nothing to acchieve, with no education, just hatred and anxiety towards their opressor. Israel is not that different from Nazi Germany in so many ways, if you compare the ""Siedlungspolitik"" to the horrible chapter of ""Warschauer Ghettos"".

And those Israeli who are ""chosen"" to live in those infamous ""Siedlungsgebiete"" are nothing but religious and patriotic lunatics.

No; I've never been to Israel. But I've seen a lot of documentations, reports, books and autobiographies. The same media which taught me the horrible crimes of Nazi Germany now teach me the Israeli mistakes and crimes.

Why am I not allowed to say what has to be said?

""This must come to an end?""

Because I am German?
Fuck that, I don't give a fuck about my nationality, I'm just a guy living in some random nation, that's it.

I don't think you understood a single bit of what I've been saying before, but maybe this will get to you.

Speaking of the sea, from Florence you could also go to Cinque Terre, it's a lovely and very romantic place, kind of the right place for a honeymoon! (my parents' honeymoon was there, just to say, but it's quite common) It's a set of five villages by the sea, basically. You may want to spend one night there rather than in Florence, in my opinion.

In Florence you'll find lot of people from the USA, when I was there the most popular night clubs for Americans were Twice and 21, if I recall correctly. Lot of people your age gather at night in Piazza Santo Spirito, if I recall correctly, but maybe you'll want to ask locals, I don't live in Florence and my memories may be wrong/outdated! :)

This is funny, because I just watched a documentary about the *boulangeries-pâtisseries* and though you can be guaranteed a store called a boulangerie truly sells a fresh, onsite baked product made by an artisan, those who call themselves pâtisseries are not required to sell homemade products which means the croissant you buy is 75% of the time not homemade but industrially produced, frozen and distributed around.

true,modomario,BELG,Belgium - Flanders,"I have to agree with wazit that the so called downvoting mobs may have increased. The ""I don't agree with you I downvote"" has always existed somewhat but I remember a post on /r/TheoryOfReddit or a sub like that from a few months back basically showing that the comment to vote ratio on posts had decreased over the years or at least that there was inversed correlation to the amount of subreddit members. In other words more and more users were voting and not commenting or checking the comments. Lurkers so to speak. (see top comments in /r/worldnews and the like calling an article out on complete bullshit but it still easily reaching the frontpage for some reason.)

Considering this I can see how the voting becomes more and more polarised and people can feel disgruntled when they just get a bunch of down-votes and no real reply arguing with them or telling them why if it may be justified. The problem doesn't really get worse it just gets more and more apparent and voicing an opinion not shared by the majority can indeed be seen as spending karma.(Not that internet points matter but you get what I mean.)

The best solution I've found is to make your posts long and to really get in the nitty gritty when you have an opinion that you know will be really controversial. Most types that are not easily convinced and just downvote when they don't like what they read often tend to just not read longer posts. Those that are open for discussion and actually interested in discussion will read it and may just change their opinion or acknowledge yours as a valid view.

Of course this isn't a solution at all but I think it helps.

edit: A different explanation might be the perceived increase in political discussion. There were more ""general"" threads as far as I remember going from ""what is your favourite desert from your country"" to ""What is the best  music from your country"", ""what do you think about eurosong"" and so on.. Those subjects seem to become exhausted though so the frontpage features more and more articles about politics, conflicts and whatnot and the discussion that comes with them.

edit2: An other reason might be the heating up of the discussion topics. The EU vs anti EU debate gets hotter as time progresses, the crisis brought some unrest and hate and the Ukraine situation was polarised from the very start.

edit3: Also consider that there are a lot of opinions based solely on bad information. So what do you do when the retributal based on that is already there but no agreement reached or regard for the other opinion by the poster in the end.   
Do you downvote him for spreading misinformation/Using horrible sources and the like or do you just let it slide. The line can be very blurry sometimes.

In questo caso, trattandosi di notizia di leggera e cultura pop, la ""E"" all'inizio del titolo serve a sottolinearne la stravaganza (succedono mille cose, e al Colosseo spunta pure Supercar). Il più delle volte la ""e"" è usata per legare tra loro titoli che stanno nella stessa sezione. Esempio: sotto ad un titolo principale ""Politica, succede una cosa"" verrà naturale mettere una roba tipo ""E Tizio sbotta: cazzarola"". In questo caso, la congiunzione serve ad attaccare i due titoli e a far capire che uno avviene nello stesso contesto dell'altro.

L'altro caso classico è ""se"", che generalmente si usa dove si vogliono sollevare interrogativi e/o stigmatizzare l'evento di cui si parla. Esempi: ""Se è un giudice a decidere della vita""; ""Se l'orco siamo noi""; ""Se liberale diventa una parolaccia"". (Per ottenere lo stesso scopo, ma con formulazione appena più blanda, sostituire ""se"" con ""quando"")

""Ma"" è la congiunzione che si usa di più nei titoli di editoriali, commenti e analisi. Serve per far passare da subito il concetto di contrarietà/critica rispetto alla notizia di cui si parla.

China's ethnic makeup is 91% Han, giving them a unique brand of cohesion that holds them together against neighbouring countries and outsiders. The Chinese are pretty racist as a result.

The Japanese basically have the same historical and cultural background as the Chinese in terms of being isolated and having a 'superior' national identity - that's where their racism comes from.  

Indians are much more diverse, but their whole society is based on hyper-amplified caste and religious differences. Basically almost everybody's identity is based on being part of a group that is better than those other groups. Indians are pretty racist as a result.

of course isolated european populations have it too. Icelanders have their national myth of racial superiority too - All the manliest vikings left Norway, stole all the prettiest women from England (which is why british people left there are all so ugly today), and settled in Iceland. That's how such a small island has produced so many beauty queens and strongman champions. Icelandics are pretty prejudiced too.

So yeah - you're right that people are like that everywhere - but the Unique thing about Europe is that it's really the only place in the world where populations aren't isolated. Almost no Asians actually have any contact with outsiders - so over there, racism doesn't really manifest itself in day to day life.  But in Europe - the population mingles on a regular basis - and has done so for half a millennium, so in Europe, we actually have a chance to be racist and prejudiced AGAINST other populations.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"&gt;it is interesting how ""acceptable views"" can shift wildly depending on what current events are going on. This goes for r/worldnews as well and other similar subreddits, not just r/Europe. It makes me wonder if people are really that fickle or if something else is at work.

I have a hypothesis on this. It goes beyond reddit and to public opinion in general. You can see in opinion polling that the any given nation's political opinions change by whole percentage points from week to week based on current events. 

It's not like those few percent which goes from one week to pro US and the next week to anti-US (or any other subject matter) are the same people. The people who're arguing loudly and, generally, downvoting have made up their minds firmly and have for quite a while. The percentage points of change are people who are near the middle threshold and don't have their minds made up: floaters voters, for instance. 

It only takes a very small event to push a large number of floating voters over the edge and push those who were already in one field of opinion or another *further* into that field of opinion to the extent where they start acting upon that opinion (by voting, upvoting/downvoting and commenting). 

Imagine a big politic spectrum. At one end you have ""pro Russia"" and at the other end of the line you have ""anti Russia"". Now imagine that on this line/political spectrum, are many marbles lined up one by one. Each event pushes these marbles one way or another, but only by a small amount. However one event might be another to push one person from the pro-Russia side into the anti-Russia side, and concurrently someone from the moderately anti Russia side goes into the very anti-Russia side. It's the same on the other end of the spectrum too. As an event makes more people ant-Russia, those who are pro Russia diminish slightly at all levels simultaneously. 

TL;DR: Public opinion is like a bunch of marbles. ",0,1398030056,null,0,false,0,cgxl7c0,t3_23j4g0,t1_cgxl7c0,t1_cgxkw65,null,1433444224,26,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,26

I'd be behind more heavy moderation. The problem is we need a consistent set of rules and these don't usually mesh well with a news orientated sub or a sub with wide ranging discussion topics. It works very well on /r/askhistorians where the subject matter and purpose of the sub is clear, but that's not the case with /r/Europe.

However, I would definitely be behind greater moderating if we could produce a good code of conduct for them and us plebs. 

As for the problems of unwillingness, I'm sure it's either seasonal (a lot of the mods are young so have exams and therefor will be back) or can be solved by having more manpower, so long as there is a clear command structure in the hierarchy of this sub. I know a majority of people on this sub (as is the case with all subs) probably wouldn't make good moderators for all sorts of reasons, but there are definitely enough who would be able to do a job like moderating long term, with the little thanks simply for the sake of increasing the longevity of a site they like.

Si vous voulez avoir une idée de ce qui se passe dans la tête d'un catho modéré (mais pas modérément catho), capable de soutenir la Manif pour tous tout en réglant ses comptes à la fois avec Frigide Barjot et Christine Boutin, et qui fait preuve d'une réflexion plutôt subtile dans ses prises de position considérées ultra-conservatrices par la plupart des Français (ses mises au point juridiques et éthiques sur l'euthanasie sont très documentées), jetez-y un coup d’œil.

Il fait siennes la tradition et la doctrine de l'Eglise catholique, mais fait également preuve de charité chrétienne dans son dialogue avec des internautes aux positions radicalement opposées. 

Vous en avez peut-être entendu parler sur le blog de Maître Eolas, tous  les deux étant avocats catholiques, avec leur lot d'opinions communes et de divergences.

**Edit:** Un ""catho modéré"", c'est quoi ? Bonne question. Koz est de la génération Jean-Paul II, attachée aux JMJ, à mille lieues des intégristes de Mgr Lefebvre. Il a soutenu la plupart des actions de Benoît XVI et du pape François. Il était opposé au *Mariage pour tous* en espérant que ça ne le ferait pas passer pour un homophobe bas du front, et a rejoint un temps la *Manif pour tous* pour ne pas laisser le champ libre aux intégristes de Civitas.

Ses positions sur l'avortement et l'euthanasie sont celles de l'Eglise catholique, ce qui peut en faire un réac voir un facho aux yeux de certains. Le journaliste Bruno-Roger Petit, qui s'est sans doute dit que ça ferait un peu gros s'il désignait Koz comme un intégriste, a forgé ce magnifique terme [d'ultra-catho](http://leplus.nouvelobs.com/contribution/935680-comment-la-manif-pour-tous-et-les-veilleurs-cherchent-a-detruire-frigide-barjot.html) pour qualifier un catholique qui a des idées catholiques.

When a subreddit grows, there's a point where the quality of discussion almost inevitably deteriorates.

In any case, the quality went noticeably downhill at some point, especially when we first had issues with a sudden increase in Muslim- and Roma bashing threads that *somehow* were frequented by users who didn't participate in other discussions, then quality improved for a while when the mods enforced a stricter policy to counter this, but the continuing increase of the number of subscribers kept having its effect.

My interpretation of protection tax is not the same as yours. By protection tax I meant that each country in NATO needs to do something to serve US interests sooner or later.

It may mean something like granting CIA the right to create illegal prisons on their territory, volunteering to participate in a ""coalition of the willing"" that gives the political illusion that more countries than just USA desire to take a certain action, aligning their intellectual property laws to better serve US corporations interests, taking on disadvantageous contracts with US corporations, the list goes on and on and on and they all happened in Romania. As you see, the protection tax can be payed in many more ways than just defense investments.

When the push comes to shove, the fact is that the NATO treaty is not a law written by God. In the event a NATO member is attacked, US still needs to actually decide if they will respect the treaty to the letter. Most naive people believe this will happen.

Comme le dit l'article, ça dépend du critère de mesure.

Evidemment, difficile de trouver des chiffres sérieux sur l'engagement dans l'action catholique, mais il me semble qu'en 2013-14, les catholiques, 18-30 ans, pratiquants réguliers, et engagés dans au moins un mouvement d'action sociale catholique ou s'en rapprochant, sont bien plus nombreux que la même catégorie qui avait 18-30 ans en 1990.

Après, si tu élargis à tous les pratiquants, par exemple, là, ça chute certainement.

&gt; Quand l'auteur accuse l'église de se couper de sa base en ne s'engageant pas franchement contre le mariage pour tous, sont-ils vraiment contre la majorité des cathos ?

Encore une fois, difficile de définir ""catho"". Appartenance à une culture, héritage familial, appartenance ""clanique"" ou sociale, convictions humaines, pratique religieuse ?

Je veux dire par là que, tout naturellement, si tu restreins aux pratiquants réguliers (Messe tous les dimanche), la majorité ""contre"" me semble écrasante. Si tu étends à ceux qui se définissent ""de culture catholique"", on trouvera sans doute une majorité pour - cette catégorie étant peut-être dix fois plus nombreuse.

Cependant, quand tu dis ""sa base"" (de l'Eglise), tu emploies un terme juste : c'est évidemment de ma première catégorie que viendront les futurs prêtres, religieux et religieuses, les futurs parents de familles ultra-nombreuses (j'en connais à paquet à 30 ans et cinq enfants...), etc - alors que ma seconde catégorie a une moyenne d'âge plus élevée, et constitue la dernière lueur d'un catholicisme ancré dans les mentalités - un catholicisme de société, si tu veux.",0,1398033680,null,0,false,0,cgxmn4t,t3_23i1j7,t1_cgxmn4t,t1_cgxg1ox,null,1433444900,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

true,bobdole3,UNSA,United States of America,"I can't tell if you're being serious or not, but literally every aspect of your post is wrong. So, in order:

&gt;I just can't believe how selfish, mean and zealous USA is acting.

It's hard to respond to what exactly you mean without specifics, but almost all of the things the US is doing in Eastern Europe right now are at the behest of the nations in the region asking for help. Ukraine has called for support in the face of Russian aggression, and so has applied sanctions on Russia. The troops being placed in Poland and the Baltics are a response to these states explicitly asking for NATO troops to be deployed within their territory, as is their right by way of their NATO membership. Within the US, pretty much no one is under the impression that these troops are actually going to be needed (it's assumed that Russia won't actually attack anyone in NATO), so the US is spending resources simply to make its allies feel better. And of course, the US isn't the only nation applying sanctions and supplying troops.

&gt;They think they can normally invade anyone and do what they want, and think no one can criticize them 

Any military action undertaken by the US is always massively criticized, both domestically, and abroad. Iraq in particular was incredibly unpopular, and the shadow of that war is honestly one of the biggest reasons why American reaction to the crisis in Ukraine has been so muted.

&gt; and when Russia just wants that little Crimea, USA goes all ""Omg Russia put sanctions wreck rouble. remove Russian forces from crimea, destroy Putin. paanicc!""

There are two immediate problems with this statement. The first is that it relies upon a logical fallacy. ""If someone else does something wrong, then it means it's ok for me to do something wrong!"" This sub has taken to calling this fallacy ""whataboutism,"" though that's not what it's normally known as in most legal or logic classes (though I admit I don't remember the proper name off the top of my head). 

Secondly, the issue at hand is that the Russian invasion was not only illegal, it was incredibly shady to boot. Even if the Russian government hadn't promised to respect Ukrainian territory and sovereignty after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and even if the Ukrainian constitution didn't dictate that a referendum on territory had to involve the entire country, it would still have been an outrage. Russia sent large numbers of unmarked troops into a foreign country without pretense or notification, and these unmarked troops administered a referendum at gunpoint. 

&gt;Russia in fact just wants to help Russians in Ukraine, but no.

And finally, there has been no credible evidence of wide scale threat to ethnic Russians in Crimea, and what violence there is has mostly been in reaction to the invasion. Russia created a problem, and then attempted to use that problem as a pretext to retroactively justify their involvement.

Ne faisons pas de faux-procès. La psychanalyse malgré les approximations et certaines erreurs méthodologiques a été comme un coup de tonnerre dans un ciel serein. C'était dans ce sens là que je l'évoquais. Les experts en marketing ont été les premiers à adopter les nouveaux concepts qui en sont sortis comme ils sont les premiers à appliquer tous les nouveaux travaux sur le psyché et le fonctionnement de nos processus décisionnels qui sortent. Cela a permis de passer des mérites comparés du produit à d'autres arguments publicitaires qui ne s'adressent plus uniquement à notre partie consciente.  

Quand je vois ceci, je me dis que peu importe que Freud soit enterré ou pas : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-psychoanalysis, l'utilité des neurosciences dans la manipulation des désirs n'en a plus tellement besoin et est plus efficace que jamais. 

&gt;Quelle est l'alternative à une société de consommation où se trouver une femme est considéré comme une attente normale et raisonnable ? 

Tu n'as pas vu là où se situait l'emphase : sur le **possédait** soit l'aspect de propriété sur une femme-objet, femme-trophée. 

&gt;Peux-tu développer ce point ? Un consensus sur quel sujet ? Parle-t-on encore du féminisme et du harcèlement de rue ?

Sur la nécessité de légiférer pour l'égalité homme-femme/la parité.

&gt;Je ne dis pas que les marxo-féministes représentent un degré de danger comparable aux Soviets, mais simplement que les schémas de pensée essentialistes et par nature radicaux/révolutionnaires sont dangereux.

Soit mais je peux te faire la même remarque que tu m'as faite. Peut-être que la société sans classes ou la société sans genres arriveront naturellement par le progrès technique et l'évolution naturelle de la société.

Après tout, a-t-on vraiment besoin de classes dans une société *post-scarcity* où la question du travail salarié n'existe plus. Ou de rôles genrés dans une société où la reproduction ne serait plus naturelle et la gestion des tâches ménagères une formalité. 

Pour finir, et en essayant de conclure sans trop de naïveté, je pense que l'émancipation des femmes est venu d'un besoin d'utiliser au mieux les ressources démographiques des pays ( notamment pendant la guerre puis après le choc pétrolier quand les gains de productivité ont commencé à stagner) et qu'une bonne utilisation des ressources ne me semble pas présider aux inégalités qui existent actuellement.  Qu'elles soient ethniques ou de sexe. Une société plus équitable sur ces points serait aussi une société qui avance plus vite/fonctionne mieux. Ou alors il faut me démontrer sans passer pour Monsieur Réaction que tout ce qui est venu avant est bon, suivait le plan divin ( la Nature si on est athée ) et qu'on doit revenir aux moeurs des Romains du temps de Tarquin sous peine d'effondrement.

That's the *easy* part. Where it gets really problematic is when you try to write down rules that you can enforce in the first place. When krattr, me, and later the other mods and initial users first discussed rules in /r/europeans (plug!), we tried to come up with rules that we were planning to brutally enforce (of course, this hasn't become necessary, because so far there's hardly any discussion). As it turns out, even if you *would* agree on a giant rule book that nobody would bother to read, you'd still need objective indicators to measure a comment by. That's just not possible, it would always come down to the moderator making a judgement call, which in turn is just asking for drama.

Take the agenda setting problem, for example. Where do you draw the line between honest posts by somebody who happens to be interested in a particular topic, and propaganda through [agenda setting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda-setting_theory)?  
There are countless other examples. When does a comment cross the line to become disrespectful or polemic? Is the occasional sarcastic undertone OK if it helps to make a fair point? What exactly is ""quality content""? We discussed those questions for hours, and there just don't seem to be any objective answers.

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"I'm anti-EU and get huge amounts of down votes. I'm weary and suspicious of German political interests and interference over other peripheral countries. Paying the tab, which they're not by the way, doesn't excuse anything and everything Germany does or says. We're not slaves. People can't be bought. If you think they can, you should be bought and sold for tree fiddy.

People don't abide by reddiquette. They vote like agreeing or disagreeing. In that sense, /r/europe is no better than an intolerant net mob. 

Not really a big thing, because most subs are. But it sterilizes any discussion. 

There's also the rampant Islamophilia. People criticizing Islam or immigration just get banned or massively down voted. It's pathetic when we can't have an opinion on cultural traits. It always gets reduced to racism... I don't like people with signs threatening other people or treating women children and gay people as something worse than animals. If you're going to pull a relativity curtain on that, then you're just as bad as them, if not worse!

Another thing that repulses me is the naive idealistic mentality that does not correlate with the world we live in. People go out of their way to argue with someone, despite having no experience with the issue being discussed. It ranges from dealing Gypsies to some people's work ethic, to beverages and food. Redditors are not anthropologists with a thesis on issues. They're normal people with limited view of the world and sharing experiences. Counter point with your own experiences. We are not representing our countries on the UN table. Oh God, we should be glad we're not!

Astroturfing is also an issue. The love for Mother Russia is getting out of hand. The amount of down votes in some well thought and well written comments only makes me think that there's a lot of blind hatred for someone or just astroturfing.

Im Gegensatz zum Animismus enthält die christliche Ideenwelt keine fortwährende und allgegenwärtige Bedrohung bzw. ist die Erlösung im Christentum ""nur"" abhängig von dem persönlichen Verhältnis zu Gott.

Konkret bedeutet das:
Vereinfacht gesprochen, gibt es im Animismus gute sowie böse Geister. Das Ziel eines ""gläubigen"" besteht nun darin, sein Verhältnis zu den guten Geistern auszubauen und sich vor den bösen Geistern zu schützen (analog wäre im Christentum das ""gottgefällige Verhalten"", welches je nach Auslegung unterschiedlich definiert sein kann). Im Unterschied zum Christentum (und auch vieler anderer Religionen) ist es im Animismus jedoch möglich Menschen durch Zauberei (d.h. Beeinflussung der Geister) Schaden zuzufügen. Dieser Umstand führt dazu, dass die Menschen permanent in einer gewissen Angst (ein besserer Ausdruck fällt mir jetzt gerade nicht ein) leben.
In der Heilslehre des Christentums besiegt Jesus jedoch die bösen Geister und Zauberer (und ergänzt somit die animistische Weltsicht), demzufolge bracht sich der Christ nicht vor solchen zu fürchten.

I think that those 200 years are what drove European society to accept the Enlightenment Values as core societal values. The ideals of the European Enlightenment didnt immediately spring into mainstream European society; it took time for them to soak in. Even the United States (whose state and political foundations were created by men who were avid admirers of the philosophers of the European Enlightenment) had slavery and restricted the vote to white men.

But these ideas held on in Western Europe, even while Emperors rose in France and Kaisers rose in Germany. Those ideals were added upon, streamlined and made applicable to daily political life. Germans after WWII looked back at the Holocaust with horror through their Enlightened lens that said that all people are equal. Same with Americans after they heard the words of Dr. King and saw the struggles of southern blacks. Also the British after they saw the determination of Gandhi in India.

* has announced they will build military installations on the Kuril Islands, a disputed territory between Russia and Japan (and have been scrambling jets to fly into Japanese airspace to incite a response from the Japanese)

Definitely go to Cafe Vienna on S1, it's a hole in a wall kind of place but it has free wifi (!) and great cheap food and drink. The Pilznüdeln and Käsespätzle were my favorite. 

Rewe was the only grocery store that I could find that accepted credit cards. Lidl, aldi, netto and penny markt all only took cash or debit.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  I would look to the grading method used on A2 and AS level mark schemes in the UK.

I've just had a look at those, but I don't think the system would transfer well. Those grading schemes to a large part rely on comparison with an objective truth (e.g., ""The student demonstrates an excellent knowledge and understanding of political concepts/theories/institutions and processes."") When you take those parts that would be applicable (e.g., ""The student applies an excellent range of developed concepts and uses appropriate political theory to construct a clear and cogent explanation or argument""), you're back at a subjective judgement by a mod, or rather, what the upvote button was intended for.  

On the topic of voting: If people would use the up- and downvotes as they were intended, that is, to upvote well thought-out and structured comments that contribute to the discussion regardless of whether or not they agree with the conclusion, and downvoted only those that are obvious trolls, spam, offensive or intentionally spread misleading information, then even a few subjective rules would be sufficient -- ""make sure your comment contributes to the discussion, keep it civil and constructive, avoid redundancy and use common sense.""  
However, those are *high* standards that are difficult to adhere to even if you have the best of intentions. We all get frustrated or impatient from time to time. Besides, those who try to stick to those common sense rules aren't the problem; it's those who put pushing their own agenda over everything else, and it doesn't take many of them for corrosive effects to show.

Of course it's conceivable to have some kind of elitist subreddit where mods enforce a certain level of discourse on a high but inevitably subjective basis. Some people might enjoy that, but it doesn't seem to be particularly inclusive to me, and I doubt it would take off. Most of all, it would be an entirely different kind of subreddit, not an appropriate way to improve the one we have.

&gt; There was also this large spreadsheet (different link) I saw a while ago which I think provides a somewhat good guideline as to what sort of comments are not meaningful.

Sorry, but no. I'll refrain from going into that within the same comment in which I just wrote about being respectful and how difficult it can be to keep up with standards one sets for oneself... It's not easy, though.

* When presented with a wall of text, most people just skip reading.
* If there are 20 articles listed, how do I know which are the most important?
* The limitations only apply to first level comments. If there are 20 important news items, 5 can be listed in the direct reply to the post. Then a comment on that bulleted list can list the other 15 in any format the contributor wishes.
* Each region has about 10 - 30 countries. That's a total of 50 to 180 articles posted. Volume is an issue unless a maximum is set.

The ""what happened"" threads are a great source of inspiration but my main complaints where always 2 fold: 

* I want to quickly get an idea about each country without digging through a wall of text.
* I want more regions than just Europe.

By limiting the number of bulleted items in the first level comments, the first objective is more readily achieved. Remember: 2nd level comments can be in whatever format.",0,1398066093,null,0,false,0,cgxyj7i,t3_23i55f,t1_cgxyj7i,t1_cgxtw5x,null,1433450571,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,flyingorange,VOJV,Vojvodina,"It's not just that posts get downvoted, it's that shitty posts belonging to one camp get undeservingly upvoted. In the Ukraine discussion I once complained about getting downvoted because I criticised Ukraine, and was told by someone that this is because my posts don't contribute to the discussion.

Fine, so the next day I wrote some really long post with links and stuff and even if someone might disagree with what I wrote there, I did contribute to the discussion since I did generate a nice little subtree under my post. In the end, my karma score was something like 80 upvotes, 78 downvotes. The top comment under my post was a one-liner, something to the effect of ""yeah that's what she said"" which didn't contirbute at all to the discussion, didn't get any replies, and was something like 50 upvotes, 10 downvotes.

The only pattern here is that you need to be pro-Ukraine, and no matter how shitty your posts are, you'll get upvoted. And since the pro-Russian posts get downvoted, you'll end up with a low quality subreddit full of Ukrainan propaganda.

Following the advice of another guy here, I filtered out the words ""Ukraine"", ""Russia"" and ""Putin"", and suddenly like 50% of all posts are gone, and this forum feels much better. [This is what I see now](http://i.imgur.com/0DpiwEE.jpg).

There's significant scope to give people more freedom. For instance, you could make it mandatory to have a leading sentence which is emboldened and bullet pointed, then followed by a paragraph of context, if the author so chooses. Readers can decide whether they want to waste their time with the additional paragraphs or not. The freedom lays with the readers and writers who are the real content creators here. You could also prescribe a rating system, where by each author must rank the articles they link to in order of relevance, so if someone provides 20 links, you know which 5 of them to read if you only want to read five.

Fight. Started in 2:00 20 April. Attackers had 4 cars. Separatist from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFjKCoAcGLs) by local TV channel [1] claims that defenders had 2 assault rifles (i.e. AK). After 1 hour attackers retreated, taking wounded and possibly dead with them.

Dead. Only confirmed dead bodies are bodies of defenders, 2 dead bodies of attackers were not confirmed. Separatist from video [1] says that from their side guy with AK was killed, father of his friend, and some 20 y.o. old guy. Woman from video [1] says that she personally saw two dead bodies -- Sergey and Pasha (Pavel), one more was wounded and died on the road to hospital, he wasn't identified because his face was disfigured. Interior ministry of Ukraine [reported](http://lifenews.ru/news/131635) that two were identified -- locals with birth dates 1957 and 1972, one still is not identified. Journalist Roman Butko [claims](https://twitter.com/Christian_bss/status/457961695885811713/photo/1) that one of the dead was Pavel Pavelko, 41 year old Anti-Maidan activist from Sloviansk according to his page in social networks (probably the one who was born in 1972).

Loot. [LifeNews showed](http://lifenews.ru/news/131635) quite a bit of various loot dropped from the attackers. Printed google maps in satellite view. Yarosh calling card. Right sector badge. ~$2K dollars in $100 bills, half in newish 2013 year bills. MG-42 Yugoslavian modification (M-53). Some documents of legal car owners. Some haphazard medkit.

Yarosh calling card. According to [this report](http://vesti.ua/donbass/48578-vizitka-jarosha-prinadlezhit-pomowniku-lidera-pravogo-sektora), it's non-personal calling card of Right Sector that can be freely taken in their office. It's not phone number of Yarosh, only number of one of his helpers.

[Personal Right sector badge](https://imgur.com/a/nu3bg). Text on the back: ""Здобудеш Українську Державу або згинеш у боротьбі за Неї"", slogan of Ukrainian nationalists. Right Sector [denied that they had personal numbered badges](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/04/20/world/europe/ukraine-shooting/index.html) -- ""we only have ID cards with letters, where we mention the department where the person works"". I googled and was not able to find a single mention of these Right Sector badges before 20 April -- for example, it was not mentioned that killed Muzychko had any badge. Some pointed that using birds in symbolics that way is not typical both for the Right Sector and Ukrainian nationalists in general. Russian channels (e.g. [NTV](http://t.co/0CYrqkXz4o)) claim that the badge was taken from dead attacker -- clearly it contradicts to the fact that no dead bodies of attackers were found.

Cars. Mitsubishi Pajero and Mitsubishi L200. One of the burned car [was identified](http://inforesist.org/odin-iz-sgorevshix-avto-pod-slavyanskom-byl-vystavlen-na-prodazhu/) -- it was on sale since 23 March with the same license plates. Telegraph journalists claim that bullets in the car were fired from back.

Captured guy allegedly from ""Right Sector"". In [the interview to LifeNews](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JojZXOlKJM), he didn't say a single word confirming that he participated in the attack, or that he was from the Right Sector -- it was all from voice-over. He was identified as trainer from Kyiv, from 15th Sotnia of Maidan self-defense (it's not Right Sector, Right Sector is 23th Sotnia).

For example, if there's a bad comment that already has a reply, do I leave it there so the reply has context, or do I remove it and accept that there will be at least three comment asking what the deleted comment said? If I leave the bad-but-replied-to comment for context, I will be accused of being inconsistent when I remove others that haven't been replied to yet, and since this one can be seen (but the others can't), it misleadingly gives the impression that comments like that one are still in the acceptable range.

Then, there are different opinions on what is and what is not acceptable. You want stricter moderation because you prioritize quality of discourse, others see Freedom of Speech as absolute and would consider it censorship. Which side people lean towards *sometimes* correlates with whether or not they agree with the political sentiment of the commenter.

In the end, we're all here because we somehow enjoy it. The occasional lighthearted joke should be OK, right? But we still want an intellectually stimulating discussion, not just a bunch of off-topic memes and puns as the top comments. So, no jokes, unless they're really good ones?

The east-Europeans remember very well the Iron curtain and the oppression from Soviet Union (Russia). Cold War was a hell, people lived in constant fear of a nuclear holocaust and now Russia/ Putin is targeting those countries again to get them into Russia's ""control"" or influence. They have even a geopolitical plan for that, 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics

&gt;The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by **Alexander Dugin**. The book has had a large influence within the Russian military, police, and statist foreign policy elites[1] and is used as a textbook in the General Staff Academy of Russian military.[1]

&gt;The book was co-authored by General Nikolai Klokotov of the General Staff Academy.[1] Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, head of the International Department of the Russian Ministry of Defence, apparently advised in the project.[1] Klotov stated that in the future the book would ""serve as a mighty ideological foundation for preparing a new military command.""

some examples:

&gt;Romania, Macedonia, ""Serbian Bosnia"" and Greece - ""orthodox collectivist East"" - will unite with the ""Moscow the Third Rome"" and reject the ""rational-individualistic West"".[1]

&gt;Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as an independent state with certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics"". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.[1]

&gt;Finland should be absorbed into Russia. Southern Finland will be combined with the Republic of Karelia and northern Finland will be ""donated to Murmansk Oblast"".[1]

I understand very well that after reading that stuff many people will start to rethink Russia. That book is not far from declaring a War. And the actions in Ukraine are strongly pointing that Putin is ready to use military power against its smaller neighbors. And all this just right after the Winter Olympics. The contrast can't be bigger than that.

Le marronnier du ""renouveau catholique"" est récurrent depuis au moins le Concile Vatican II, c'est-à-dire, un démi-siècle. A chaque fois on parle de jeunes cathos ultra-motivés qui vont repeupler les églises. Et pourtant, celles-ci sont de plus en plus vides, et c'est encore pire dans les couvents et séminaires, qui pourtant devraient attirer justement ces jeunes. Ce que j'en pense? Bon, c'est assez simple: l'adolescence est un âge difficile. Dans le passage à l'âge adulte on cherche des référents au-delà des parents. Pour beaucoup c'est Justin Bieber ou Lady Gaga, tandis pour une minorité, plus introvertie, cela peut être de groupes politiques et/ou religieux plus ou moins ""rebelles"". On voit ainsi les ""Veilleurs"" tout comme les jeunes salafistes prêts à partir en Syrie. Ce que tous ces groupes ont en commun? Un idéalisme mal compris et un rejet fondamental du compromis, qui est perçu comme fruit du cynisme du monde adulte, plutôt que comme le résultat de la nécessité de vivre avec l'Autre.

Le plus triste, ce qu'on retrouve souvent, à la tête de ces groupes, justement les personnalités les plus cyniques, les plus dépourvues de scrupules sur le chemin du pouvoir. Cet article en est un exemple assez rageant: alors que les ""Manifs pour tous"" (tout comme, dans un registre similaire, les ""journées de retrait de l'école"") étaient des exemples flagrants de manipulation politique on ne peut plus cynique du sentiment religieux, l'auteur reproche justement à la hiérarchie catholique de ne pas s'être suffisamment prêtée à ce jeu.

Or, si je ne porte pas la hiérarchie catholique particulièrement dans mon cœur, je pense que ce choix à non seulement été moralement approprié, mais aussi très raisonnable. S'il est vrai que l'église catholique pourrait bénéficier d'un supplément de passion que sa gérontocratie n'est manifestement pas en état de lui donner, il est également vrai que les tempêtes hormonales de l'adolescence et post-adolescence ne sont pas une fondation stable pour une institution avec deux millénaires d'histoire. Ces ""jeunes enragés"" finiront par devenir des adultes plus réfléchis, posant souvent un regard fort critique sur ceux qui auront profité de leurs crises d'ados. Et, finalement, on peut difficilement reprocher aux évêques de n'avoir pas voulu suivre leurs ""bases"" derrière les chants de sirènes de faux prophètes on ne peut plus éloignés des enseignements du Christ des Évangiles...

&gt;Il y a des tas de gens qui ne s'adresseraient jamais à quiconque si ce n'était pas une femme, y compris des pépés ou de bons pères de famille. Et évidemment que ""salope"" a une connotation sexuelle.

Salope est un équivalent de fils de pute (on ne dit jamais fille de pute), ou bâtard, sans connotation sexuelle. Les hommes et les femmes ne sont pas visés par les mêmes insultes, ça ne va pas plus loin.

&gt;Il y a une vraie différence avec le harcèlement des hommes ne serait-ce que par la fréquence (on t'insulte pas pour un paquet de clopes tous les jours et de manière liée à ta tenue).

Les racailles insultent et agressent tous les jours pour des clopes, et c'est tous les jours ""baisse les yeux"" et on menace tous les jours, quand ça n'est pas pire. 

Rien que cette semaine [voici un exemple](http://www.midilibre.fr/2014/04/15/dix-ans-de-prison-pour-des-mutilations-au-sabre,848744.php) de ce qui arrive quand tu refuses une cigarette. Et [encore un autre](http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/region/loison-sous-lens-agresse-pour-son-portefeuille-sur-le-ia35b54052n2057146). C'est toujours la même chose : ils demandent une cigarette puis agressent violemment, chose qui n'arriverait pas si c'était une femme.

&gt;à moins de se dlguiser en femme un homme ne peut comprendre qu'en regardant des caméras cachées.

Tous mes amis ont déjà été agressés physiquement pour une cigarette ou un regard de travers, depuis le collège c'est comme ça. À moins de te déguiser en homme je doute que tu puisses comprendre.

**On demande la même chose : pouvoir marcher dans la rue tranquillement**, pourquoi ça te dérange tant ?

C'est une bonne question.

Si je peux me permettre une réponse vague, c'est parce que la vie en société est toujours un numéro d'équilibriste entre les intérêts des différents groupes qui la composent. 

Si le groupe A cesse de réfuter les critiques sous prétexte qu'il est transparent et n'a rien à se reprocher, tu peux être sûr que des extrémistes du groupe B vont finir par créer un environnement hostile où les membres de A sont mis sur la sellette en permanence. Ici c'est hommes-femmes dont on parle, mais ça s'applique à tous les groupes.

La raison pour laquelle on doit se méfier de certaines initiatives qui peuvent devenir excessives, même si je n'ai rien à me reprocher quant à la manière dont je traite personnellement les femmes, tu l'as déjà dans ce thread: un redditeur est déjà en train de conclure que dire ""vous êtes charmante"" (je te laisse CTRL + F ça) constitue un acte de domination. Je reconnais la légitimité de la lutte contre le harcèlement de rue dont sont victimes les femmes, mais je n'accepterai pas de subir une présomption de culpabilité même sur des interactions a priori normales voire attentionnées avec la gente féminine.

Si on ne remet pas un peu d'ordre pour trouver un équilibre raisonnable entre ceux qui veulent bâillonner même les hommes polis et bien intentionnés et les femmes qui ne veulent pas se faire harceler, on va se retrouver face à du n'importe quoi.

D'ailleurs il ne faut pas se leurrer, la raison pour laquelle les féministes se sentent à présent obligé(e)s de faire des concessions comme quoi les hommes souffrent etc, c'est quand même parce qu'il y'a des lourdingues comme nous qui tapons du pied en utilisant leur propre logique jusqu'à ce qu'ils/elles admettent que les hommes aussi ont droit à un traitement équitable.

And very proud of the things that make them distinct. The aboriginal culture, they're own foods and music, traditions, etc.

They are well aware of the natural paradise they inhabit. They are aware that tourists flock there *en masse*.

What you want to do is to distinguish yourself from the average tourist / tourism worker, and try to make friends with Canarian people. Not so easy, but worth it. Otherwise you won't really ""connect"" with the island. So  study the cultural traits and try to blend in socially.

Remember that there is a practising catholic behind almost every jovial smile, so avoid the faux pas regarding religion.

Alcohol is cheap, good and abundant, so one has to practise restraint on their own. There is no nurse state to do that for you.

Leave the town and get to know the island. Fantastic sights to be found.

Always accept if a local wants to invite you for a barbecue or whatever, those are the best times to make friends. Hell, have your own barbecues too. :)

Go out, enjoy the beaches, pick up a sport/hobby (trekking, surfing, bicycle, in-line skating, beach volley, fishing, whatever), and just enjoy the hell out of life. Have a cold beer or a coke and don't burn yourself.

true,AKA_Sotof,DENK,Denmark,"&gt;When Edward Snowden and the NSA activities first came into the limelight, there was a constant talk here about how the EU member states should distance themselves from the US and leave the intelligence and military treaties. Now all that attention has been focused on the crisis in the Crimea and I've seen more pro-US/anti-Russian stances in r/Europe. Posts that advocate greater cooperation with the US have lots of up votes now compared to 6 months ago. 

I'm anti-Putin and anti-big-brother-USA. Simply put I think Europe should've shown more backbone and solidarity in both cases. Divide et impera is especially true when it comes to Europe and frankly I hate it with a passion. I think Europe has a shot at being a force for good, but it'll never be that as long as it lets itself be divided.

Opinions change, as they should, when new information comes available. When the Snowden business started Russia had not made itself apparent as a threat to the entire Western world. NATO, at the time, seemed pointless, and certainly not like a defensive alliance against Russia. When Putin makes Russia a target all that changes. People unite against a common enemy and Putin is very clearly an enemy of the free world.

At the same time, I do believe we, as in Europe, should and should have taken in Snowden and opposed the rampant abuses of the NSA. The NSA is a danger to every democracy on the planet with what it is doing. And that's an understatement of the threat posed from the NSA.

I don't have anything against Americans or Russians, but I sure as hell got something against both governments. Both are corrupt and both are only keeping ""democracy"" around as a charade. 

On the short term Putin is the greater threat, but in long term the greatest threat against freedom of thought and speech on our planet is the American government, and those who pull their strings. I support standing with the US only for the moment.

Man könnte die soziale Marktwirtschaft natürlich ""freier"" (für kleinere Unternehmen, für Bürger) nennen, als der gnadenlos unregulierte Freie Marktwirtschaft nach Adam Smith, das kann man so machen - würde Ich aber nicht, weil das begrifflich falsch und noch dazu missverständlich ist.

Entièrement d'accord. Mes critiques et appréhensions portent sur les groupes féministes qui ont plus ou moins consciemment transposé l'analyse marxiste aux inégalités hommes-femmes, vu que ces groupes ont des analyses essentialistes et radicales (et dont la véracité est improuvable) qui sont dangereuses je pense.

&gt;  Une ""féministe"" qui n'arrive pas à se soucier des problèmes des hommes d'elle même n'en est pas une

No True Scotsman.

A partir du moment où les gens se définissent d'eux-mêmes d'une étiquette, je pars du principe qu'on ne peut pas leur retirer pour conclure que ce ne sont pas des ""vrai(e)s"", sinon on arrive à la conclusion que personne ou presque n'est ""vraiment"" féministe (ou marxiste, ou libéral, ou socialiste, ou n'importe, etc). Tu reconnais toi-même que la composition réelle des rangs ""pseudo féministes"" en France laisse à désirer.

En plus ça n'est pas forcément négatif qu'il y'ait un va-et-vient et des échanges d'idée entre féministes et ""masculinistes"". Avant de discuter régulièrement avec des féministes mon langage était très sexué et je ne savais pas que certaines femmes s'estimaient peu prises au sérieux au travail, de même que certaines féministes ne savaient pas non plus que les hommes rencontrent aussi des problèmes en fonction du sexe.

&gt; On me dit que je suis charmante, je dis merci ou je sourie. On commence à me suivre dans la rue, à me reluquer de haut en bas et à m'inviter à boire un verre alors que je dit que j'étais pas intéressée plusieurs fois, je commence à paniquer et à me sentir en danger.

On est 100% d'accord, c'est ce que je voulais dire par trouver un équilibre entre ne pas créer un environnement impossible à respirer pour les hommes lambda, et ne pas tolérer les agissements vraiment abusifs de certains hommes.

Au final je ne suis plus trop sûr de sur quoi notre désaccord se porte, parce que je suis d'accord sur le fond mais juste avec la précision supplémentaire que je me méfie de tout discours public qui pourrait créer une atmosphère hostile aux hommes ou faire oublier par omission que les hommes aussi subissent des formes sexuées de violence verbale et physique (""baisse les yeux"", ""t'as pas une cigarette [suivi d'un coup de poing] ?"", par ex).",0,1398082551,null,0,1398082903,0,cgy185p,t3_23iq06,t1_cgy185p,t1_cgy0kl5,null,1433451913,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

Während ich mich außerhalb meines eigentlichen Ausbildungsberufes bewege, dann merke ich immer sehr schnell, was mir meine Freizeit und die Beschäftigungen darin so für mich bedeuten. Die Joblage hier ist nicht die Beste (10 Bewerber pro Stelle) und eigentlich will ich auch gar nicht zurück in die IT. Es hat jetzt über 6 Jahre gedauert, bis ich meine passende Nische in der IT gefunden habe. Jetzt suche ich nur noch den passenden Arbeitgeber. Ich weiß dann, dass mir die Agentur solange ich mich auf der Suche befinde nicht weiter helfen wird und die Unterstützung auch eher mangelhaft ist. So entscheide ich mich kurzfristig für Zeitarbeit um über die Runden zukommen, etwas zu tun zu haben und fokussiere meine Freizeit dann darauf mich weiter zu bilden, was dann irgendwie ein Gefühl des Stillstandes bewirkt, der sich fix mal zu einer Depression wandeln kann.  

Auch ich würde oft gerne einfach weg gehen und in einer anderen Stadt neu starten. Der Lebenslauf ist inzwischen so zerfleddert mit verschiedenen Firmen und Arbeitgebern für die ich schon gejobbt habe. Zum Glück kann ich noch von mir sagen, dass ich nichts zu verbergen habe, wenn mich mal jemand fragt, warum dort eine Lücke von sechs Monaten drin ist.  

Es ist so viel Zeit vergangen, in der ich in die Zukunft geblickt und mich einfach nur davor gegraust habe, den jeweiligen IT Job mit den  gleichen bescheuerten Leuten zu machen, bis ich zu alt bin um etwas von der Welt zu sehen. Der Terror der Vorstellung, sich allein die nächsten zwei Jahre mit diesem Teamleiter im Großraumbüro gut tun zu müssen ließ mich Abends schon mal verzweifeln.  

Naja, ich habe gesucht und gefunden. Ein schönes Gefühl, dass es in der IT doch noch etwas gibt, was mich glauben lässt, dass es etwas für die Zukunft sein könnte. Eigentlich hatte ich dieses Gefühl auf dem Weg verloren. Das Gute daran ist, dass ich nicht mal unbedingt einen Arbeitgeber brauche, um den Job zu machen. Man darf ruhig mal eine Runde freelancen. Würde mich dennoch freuen, bis zum Spätsommer irgendwo unter zu kommen.

Viele Ideen davon tauchen auch auf seinem Blog auf, [hier](http://calnewport.com/blog/about/) wäre ein Überblick. 

Seine Kernthese besagt, dass man nicht irgendwelchen Passionen hinterherlaufen soll, sondern sich erstmal nützliche Fähigkeiten aneignen soll, mit denen man etwa bessere Arbeitsbedingungen und -freiheiten heraushandeln kann. Leidenschaft für eine Tätigkeit entsteht dann sowieso wenn man gut in seiner Sache ist. Aber der Weg dahin erfordert eben harte und unbequeme Arbeit.

Es ist beispielsweise ein Unterschied ob du ein mittelmäßiger Fotograf in einer deutschen Kleinstadt bist und ständig Bewerbungsfotos von Jugendlichen schießt, oder ob du einer der gefragtesten Wildtierfotografen der Welt bist, der ständig um den Globus reist um Bilder von Caribous zu machen.

Und da du mit deinen jetzigen Fähigkeiten bereits in einer Nische profitabel bist, würde ich an deiner Stelle weitermachen und dabei den Hochschulabschluss noch mitnehmen, da Deutschland ja eher ein recht titelgeiles Land ist. Deine spezielle Branche hast du jetzt nicht erwähnt, aber die Chancen  stehen wohl recht gut, dass du noch nicht zu den zehn weltweit besten Vertretern deines Fachs gehörst.

Und außerdem erwähnst du deine große Freizeit. Selbst wenn es dich irgendwann anöden sollte Produktfotos oder was auch immer zu schießen, könntest du die restliche Zeit dann nutzen um Greenpeace-Aktionen zu fotografieren, oder was auch immer dir vorschwebt. 

Aber dafür brauchst du zunächst das Geld um dir deinen gewünschten Lebensstil zu finanzieren, und es erscheint mir als Außenstehenden wahrscheinlicher dass du das schaffst, indem du deinen jetzigen Geldhahn maximierst, als dass du mit 28 umschwenkst um dann irgendwann mit Leuten zu konkurrieren, die womöglich jetzt schon ihren PhD in Biologie haben.

The UK government denying Scotland the right to vote on independence using that logic, for example, would be unthinkable. Even 40 years ago, when we had the first vote, it was unthinkable to deny people the right to self-determination.

Perhaps the Spanish debate is different. In the UK however, with the precedent we set with Gibraltar and the Falklands, denying people the right to choose just isn't an option for any politician.

Ugh.

&gt;They have interests, strengths and weaknesses.

Shulz has no interests, strengths and weaknesses? 

&gt; The leaders of the European Parliament almost seem like a conspiracy to bore the European electorate to death.

To you as an UKIP voter maybe. For me they seem more similar to the way politicians behave in the German political culture. 

&gt;They have no charisma or force of personality, how can they hope to play the political game well?

By doing a good job? Work comes before PR. at least in some EU countrys in relation to politicians (see Christian Wulff affair and how people rate the popularity of their politicians in Germany, basically those  that appear to be hard working come before those who make cover shoots of their families for newspapers)

&gt;Say what you like about Nigel Farage, for example, but he is charismatic and able to articulate his views in a way that the 'layman' can understand. That latter skill is so important to the democratic system I cannot fathom how these people climbed to the top of the ladder.

The UKIP still has not put out its party policy programe, so I see how its easy to ""articulate"" something people want to hear. 

There is a reason why he is viewed as an populist outside the island. Shulz could chose to tell everybody what they want to hear, and put his personal gain before the longterm interest of the EU. But different from Farage he wont be in the opposition, as such he cant say whatever he wants, because he knows it will hurt him in the political game. 

You want the future, maybe, President of the European Commission to talk the talk like the future fringe populist aka. forever opposition guy?

And what is he supposed to do or say to make the layman understand his views? 

I mean you have a point that they schuld use more video bits and short packaging their policy views in order to propagate better their positions. 

But nobody cares about them, thats why they dont appear the same way as a brand of sorts.

I mean did we read the same article?

Things like this:

&gt;In order to fight against tax evasion within and outside the European Union, Schulz promised a simple principle: ""the country of profit will be the country of taxation!""

Is more then enough of non-""Boreocracy"" for me and most of his voters I assume.

I mean a sentence like this:

&gt;It's no longer the Bureaucracy in Brussels, it's the Boreocracy as the most tepid and uninspiring personalities known to man suddenly assume relevance, ensuring further voter disconnect

Is simple taste that I dont know how to counter with arguments. If you want him to behave like your PM during question time in the Parliament or to behave like its the same press ""culture"" like on your part of the island then you are in for an disappointment. 

I personally dont see why officials should behave like entertainers, its not part of democracy, or ""Boreocracy"", its tax payed idiotism that you want.

My roommate is German and when she went to the south for the first time she said: ""This is like go back to Germany, this is not Gran Canaria"", and it's really a shame when tourist come here and they only see that part of the island because is where hotels and apartments for tourist are

true,canteloupy,ZBSuisse,Suisse,"&gt;conclure que dire ""vous êtes charmante"" (je te laisse CTRL + F ça) constitue un acte de domination

En fait, ça dépend. Parce qu'il y a une manière de voir ça qui consiste à dire qu'on ne leur demande pas leur opinion, aux gens, et que l'offrir sans cesse et sans qu'elle soit sollicitée c'est désagréable. Et qu'il y a derrière toute communication un but. Le but de ceux qui complimentent quelqu'un peut être louable, simplement pour faire plaisir, peut être de draguer en étant sincère, ce qui est bien sûr permis mais il ne faut pas s'attendre à être apprécié en retour, mais le but peut aussi être de signifier à quelqu'un qu'il est là pour son plaisir à soi. C'est cette dernière raison de donner un compliment qui est du coup beaucoup moins innocente. Mais ça se communique de manière non verbale, avec des indices contextuels. Parfois on peut se tromper et on est vraiment face à quelqu'un qui drague, ou qui est sincère.

Pour expliquer un peu mieux, peut-être que je peux prendre l'exemple des mecs qui s'asseoient à une table de café pour noter le cul des nanas qui passent. Clairement, là on est dans la domination et la qualification de la femme comme objet sexuel qui peut être jugé par un homme, et qui devrait même s'en inquiéter.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ich glaube uns plagt alle das selbe Problem. Wollen wir wirklich wie unsere Eltern 40+ Jahre arbeiten, in Jobs die uns nicht glücklich machen, aber Geld bringen?

Meine Eltern hatten eigentlich keine Wahl, was sie studieren. Es wurde mehr oder weniger von meinen Großeltern entschieden. Jetzt arbeiten beide in erfolgreichen Unternehmen und haben verantwortungsvolle und gut bezahlte Jobs. Aber außer dem späten Feierabend und die paar Tage Urlaub im Jahr bleibt auch nicht so viel übrig.

Meine Mutti überlegt immer wieder was sie machen könnte und mein Vati möchte es nur noch bis zur Rente durchziehen (aus Verantwortungsbewusstsein).

Eigentlich hatte ich immer erwartet, dass ich irgendwann auch einfach so werde. Irgendwann bin ich erwachsen und hab meinen Job und dann ist es eben so. Jetzt, nach etlichen Verirrungen und mit 25, weiß ich, dass es nicht so kommen wird.

Ich kann mir einfach nicht mehr vorstellen 8+ Stunden jeden Tag vorm Computer im Büro zu sitzen und Dinge zu machen, die mich nicht interessieren. Deshalb habe ich mich vor 3 Jahren freiberuflich selbstständig gemacht.

Mehr Geld? Manchmal ja, manchmal nein. Mehr Zeit? Definitiv, aber ich bekomme Schuldgefühle, wenn ich nicht den Tag vorm Computer verbringe (Ich weiß wie sinnlos das ist). Besseres Leben? Ich denke schon. Das halbe Jahr verbringe ich im warmen Ausland und die andere Hälfte lebe ich recht flexibel an verschiedenen Orten in Deutschland. Der Nachteil daran ist, dass ich quasi keinen Urlaub mehr habe und immer an den Job denke. Auch erfüllt mich mein Job nicht, aber es ist ein kleineres Übel als ähnliches im Großraumbüro.

Geld bleibt zum Sparen auch kaum über, aber ich hoffe das ändert sich irgendwann. Eigentlich kann ich auch glücklich sein, denn mein Freund macht das gleiche und wir können eben flexibel Leben. Die Kollegen meiner Mutter scheinen alle zu denken, dass wir ein Traumleben haben.


Aaaber Quarterlife-Crisis Ahoi, ich habe genau die gleichen Fragen wie du. Wir haben uns ein kleines Ziel gesetzt: Ein günstiges Haus soll es irgendwann sein und dann arbeiten wir eben nicht mehr, sondern an etwas, das uns Spaß macht. Bis dahin muss ich irgendwie noch herausfinden, wie ich arbeiten kann, um mehr Geld zu verdienen, ohne meine Seele zu verkaufen.

Especially this:
*If a recession hit Ukraine while in the EU sometime in the future there is no way of knowing the country wouldn't turn to Russia for help or shelter.* ---&gt; *So yes, I think EU does want a weak Ukraine [...]*

For me, if Ukraine is weak = EU does not want it. EU has to do something now, even if very reluctantly, because the first antagonistic step has been taken by someone else. And because some time ago (actually long time ago) there were talks and programs with Ukraine to let it in, EU can't just say we dont want you anymore, as much as EU would like to say it. That's the feeling Im getting abt the EU in this situation. You seem to think that EU is fighting to incorporate Ukraine (the same way Russia is).

One thing from your previous comments leads to your final conclusion, and its the following line: ""a subserviant ally they can drain economically"". But on the other hand, from the EU perspective, it's the poor, weak and unpredictable countries that drain the EU, not the other way around. You cant drain poor countries too much, you'll have to finally let their unemlpoyed in your country, let them work legally and let them get the benefits etc, then you have this political problem with anti-immigration etc., in the beginning they cant contribute fiscally so much to the common economy, so really...

Quando, alla caduta del Muro, l'Italia del cattocomunismo ha iniziato a smembrarsi, lentamente ha iniziato a morire una concezione della cultura come strumento di riscatto personale e sociale. I valori di quell'Italia, piacciano o meno, conferivano alla nazione un'identità. 

Quell'identità, ed il rispetto e lo spazio per la cultura che ne erano un tratto fondante, hanno iniziato a morire con l'avvento di Craxi, percorrendo poi una tristissima parabola discendente nell'oscena Italia berlusconiana. Ora abbiamo naufraghi del cattolicesimo e del comunismo aggrappati ai loro scogli, molto fascismo, molta ignoranza, molto farsi i cazzi propri, e miscugli vari di questi ed altri pessimi ingredienti. Ci siamo tristemente americanizzati, nella peggiore maniera possibile. L'identità del nostro Paese oggi è qualcosa da cui preferisco distogliere lo sguardo: non per nostalgia delle ideologie, io che cattolico o comunista non sono mai stato, ma per nostalgia dello spessore culturale, politico ed umano.

There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that ""my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.""

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"I got given this topic as part of an [EYP](http://www.eypej.org/) project where we had to make resolutions on various pan European issues. 

There's two main ways that an EU wide minimum wage can be established, each with their own problems. 

The first and most obvious is to have a blanket minimum wage across the whole European Union, the same way the UK has a UK wide minimum wage. This obviously poses all sorts of problems due to the huge disparity in the costs of living in different EU countries. You'd end up with Italians making thrupence minimum wage and Romanians buying mansions (ok, not that extreme, but you get the picture)

The solution to this problem is to make the minimum wage connect to the cost of living* in your region. It need not necessarily be an entire EU country, but could go down to sub national divisions for which accurate determinations of the costs of living can take place, e.g. the German Bundesländer, French departments, and British countries(and province, and principality). 

However there is still a benefit to the first way. One could see the EU wide living wage as simply a minimum requirement across the whole EU, and then expect memberstates with much much higher costs of living to cater the legislation to their specific circumstances themselves (IIRC this is the model the USA follows). This would be a very common EU approach to legislation as the EU doesn't usually like to be getting all up in everybody's business too much. 

It depends what you really want out of a minimum wage. If you want to ensure all people who work can earn a living wage, then the adjusted minimum wage is a good idea, however, if you merely want *some* basic restrictions on what companies can put their employees through, than the European one-size-fits-all might be more your style. 

*There is a certain level of flexibility in what you think the cost of living is for a region, depending on what sort of things you think are essential for life in a given country.
