Se, dal punto di vista tecnico, fare default avrebbe degli esiti simili al riprendere il controllo sulla moneta, dal punto di vista politico ritornare alla lira vorrebbe dire, nel bene e nel male, ritornare a fare politica economica interna. Bisognerebbe iniziare a chiedersi chi sia a voler impedire questo, e per quali interessi - sia in Italia che all' estero.

Ma chiediamoci anche chi vuole ridare la politica monetaria (non economica) in mano alla nostra classe dirigente. Io, per esempio, no. 

&gt; Finchè l' Italia è nell' euro, specie a queste condizioni e con questa quantità di debito sul groppone, il ministero dell' economia italiano è a Bruxelles.

Non solo a Bruxelles. Ma mi sembra ovvio che se dipendiamo dai prestiti esteri per ripagare i debiti in scadenza, la nostra libertà di manovra è limitata. Ci si doveva pensare prima. Non ricordo grossi inni alla rivoluzione quando ci indebitavamo come marinani ubriachi, no? Il governo Prodi ha tentato di ridurre il debito, quando è caduto poco mancava alla festa nazionale.

true,italianjob17,italy,,"I suppose that for ""anti-semitic actions going on in that area"" you refer to half a graffiti writing they tried to do on a wall few days ago. Seriously the area is 100% safe. Also since the 60's there are cctv cameras and a 24/7 patrol of Carabinieri police in the district. Jewish district is probably the safest and most controlled area of Rome now that I think about it!

About night panoramas you can't miss the view from the terrace in front of Garibaldi's statue up the hill of Gianicolo, behind Trastevere district. The exact address if you have a gps is Piazza Giuseppe Garibaldi. There is no restaurant up there, but asaif there is a bar/pub/cafe. Maybe now that it's summer there's something else but I've not been there recently so I don't know. 

The Zodiaco is a restaurant up Monte Mario hill with a breathtaking view over the city but it's a really expensive restaurant.

true,ajsdklf9df,null,null,"&gt;The entire anti-GMO movement is rife on baseless fearmongering and anti-science attitudes. 

There certainly are many people who are against GMO thanks to anti-science attitudes. But others have very rational reasons to be against GMOs in the EU. 

First, no one in the EU is suffering from a lack of calories. This is just no a problem for the EU. The EU like most of developed world **overproduces** food. And uses government subsidies to artificially raise farming income.  For example, the average cow in the EU is subsidized to the tune of $2 per day, when many people in the developing world live on $1 a day.

Second, Glyphosate-resistant crops, which make up the majority of GM crops, increase the use of glyphospate pesticides. This is good for the farmers, and good for the pesticide manufactures, but not good for the environment.

You could argue the lower food prices are good for people in the EU, but again, no one in the EU truly suffers from a lack of food. And if we wanted **cheaper** foods, dropping trade barriers, and ending subsidies, would result in a much bigger price drop, than using GMOs would. The EU is already artificially subsidizing farming, why should we allow even more artificial help?

GMOs like golden rice could be good for places which lack food, and vitamin A. But the EU has no lack of food. In fact, just like in the US many foods daily consumed, like breakfast cereals, are artificially fortified with vitamins. 

The average EU person has little to nothing to gain from GMOs. EU farmers could gain from them. Manufactures of pesticides and GM seed sellers could benefit. The average person in the developing world could benefit. But the average person in the EU? I don't see how a well of European could benefit from GMOs.

**Most favorite**

Can't decide between Denmark, the Benelux and France. I should probably say Netherlands because they are my closest neighbors (only 40 kilometers away) and I know them very well. Can't say anything negative about them in general. On the other hand I have the soft spot for the Danish and the Scandinavian culture, and I like the Danish landscape. So Denmark are strong candidate too. If I'd live closer to the Danish border and know the Danes better, there would be no question about who is my favorite.

And then there is France. Culturally they are not exactly my piece of cake. I'm on of those who love to make fun of the French culture and their language. But that's also the reason why I respect them that much. We have overcome our dark history between Napeoleon and Hitler to form the seed of the European Union together with the Benelux countries, and despite all cultural difference we have developed a very close, trusting and productive relationship. That means a lot to me. However, my feelings towards France are rather respectful and pragmatic and not very emitional, and I have a feeling that most people in France think the same about their relationship with Germany.




**Neutral**

Poland and Czech Republic. Can't say much about them because I'm not very exposed to them. However, I have noticed that both countries are developing in a positive way, and I expect especially  Poland to become an influential power-house in Central Europe very soon, forming a strong European back-bone with France and Germany. Anyway, as you can see my thoughts about these two countries are mainly focused at their roles as neighbors in the European Union.




**Least favorite**

Switzerland and Austria, with slight advantages for Switzerland since they don't suffer from the same inferiority complex as their Austrian neighbors (but I don't like some of the xenophobic tendencies Switzerland has shown in recent years). Austria, what the frak is wrong with you?  Why are you always complaining and especially looking at your German neighbors? You are not a ""little and inferior Germany""! You are proud and well-developed country in the heart of Europe! Why do you care that much about the Germans and how you compare with them (usually with the result that you feel inferior again (for no fucking reason!) and complain about an alleged German arrogance). On top of that I have made several bad epxierences in Austria, from ""Sorry, we are out on Almdudler!"" (but only when the Germans asked) to ""Better don't reveal that you are German!"" when I was out with my Austrian relatives.

- Les reposts ne sont absolument pas interdits. Et ça arrive en fait très rarement. 

 On ne dirait peut-être pas mais il y a plein de films français/francophones, dont de nombreux films très populaires qui n'ont pas encore été soumis, donc n'hésitez pas à poster même si vous vous dîtes que ""celui-ci il a forcément déjà été posté plusieurs fois"", c'est probablement pas le cas. Et quand bien même c'est pas un souci. 

 Par bon sens il serait bon de vérifier que le film n'a pas été posté très récemment. (Et encore, au début du sub on avait posté Amélie Poulain plusieurs fois comme une blague parce que c'est tellement reconnaissable que le défi était d'essayer de trouver une scène ""difficile"" et pas sur GIS.) 

Sinon moi je peux te dire que j'ai posté beaucoup de films des années 2010, surtout dans la catégorie drame/comédie dramatique, au début. Depuis un petit moment j'ai essayé de diversifier en postant des films plus vieux, des ""classiques"". Mais donc il en reste plein.


- Il me semble que le film qui a été le plus posté c'était ""le grand soir"", mais seulement 3 ou 4 fois, c'est pas non plus énorme. Et ça remonte maintenant. Il y en a quelques autres qui ont été postés 2 fois mais je ne me souviens plus desquels et c'est pas récent donc ils pourraient revenir sans souci.

- Certains se posent peut-être la question des documentaires: bien sûr ils sont autorisés.  J'en ai posté mais en le précisant. (C'est pas obligatoire de préciser d'entrée, je l'avais fait mais c'est pas une règle).

- Concernant la liste donc je ne pense pas que ce soit utile dans le but d'éviter des reposts puisque ça arrive peu. Je m'étais dit qu'on le ferait un jour si ça devenait nécessaire de prévenir sur les films les plus postés. 

 Ce serait un boulot qui prendrait pas mal de temps mine de rien mais c'est vrai qu'il serait intéressant de classer les films soumis pour voir si une décennie/un genre/un réalisateur se détache et éventuellement pour cerner les goûts de chaque personne qui poste. (Pour la décennie là encore, à mon avis vu le nombre de films récents que je poste les années 2010-2014 doivent dominer largement, c'est aussi ce qui est facilement accessible en téléchargement). 

 Mais donc si jamais on décidait de créer une liste il faudrait réfléchir à ce qu'on met dedans, si on classe par date de soumission ou par ordre alphabétique...

- Pour les gifs donc pas de souci non plus. Pour moi ça ne pose pas de problème de commencer par un screenshot/un gif/un indice sonore. (D'ailleurs si quelqu'un peut me dire comment capturer un son facilement sur vlc ou autre, je crois que j'avais un peu cherché mais j'avais eu la flemme... ça pourrait être une bonne idée.)

true,SorinCiprian,ROMA,Romania,"They discovered 15 million tonnes of petrol and 100 billion cubic meters of gas in the Black Sea relatively close to Romania's coast. After that, Ukraine claimed a huge portion of Romania's waters which would have boxed us in, allowing them to access all those resources. After the bilateral negotiations failed, Romania took the case to the International Court of Justice and won 80% of the disputed territory. 

Also, in 2004, they tried to open some shipping canal from the Danube to the Black Sea. This would have had dramatic effects on the wildlife in the delta. Obviously, Romania took issue with that (as did most countries in the world and all the environmental NGOs), because the delta is within our borders. Again, Ukraine refused to comply and again Romania took the issue to the International Court of Justice and won. The court agreed on political sanctions against Ukraine. 

&gt;The Danube Delta has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991. The European Union has repeatedly asked Ukraine to halt the project, as have Romania and the United States. The Worldwide Fund for Nature has said the canal threatens the delta's most important wetland, where 70 percent of the world's white pelicans and 50 percent of pygmy cormorants live.

After all these events with which Ukraine would have gotten away with if it wasn't for us, meddling Romanians (this is probably the first time I ever referenced something), there was a lot of anti-Romanian propaganda in the Ukrainian press. I remember some Ukrainians telling me that we are imperialists and that our press is filled with Ukrainian hate. Obviously, in reality it was the other way around. Our press didn't give a shit about Ukraine until this recent conflict. 

Basically, they were kind of a regional bully. 

Nevertheless, the issues are now resolved and I hope we will become friends.

true,Jacksambuck,ZZZZZZpoulpe,Poulpe,"&gt;Premier point d'interrogation : ""made to penetrate"" comprend également des incidents entre hommes, où aucune femme n'est présente. Cependant, ton discours (""diminuer la culpabilité des femmes"", ""lorsqu'une femme viole un homme"") implique que ce n'est que des femmes qui font ça. Pourquoi ?




Je n'ai jamais dis que les femmes sont les seules à ""faire pénétrer"", mais elles représentent la majorité de ceux qui ""font pénétrer"". C'est dans le rapport, au paragraphe ""sex of the perpetrator"", quelques pages apres les tableaux.

Je te donne les raisons probables pour lesquelles le rapport a choisi de ne pas révéler certaines de ses données dans les conclusions: parce que ça va à l'encontre du discours féministe typique sur le sujet (""les hommes sont rarement violés et commettent quasiment tous les viols"").


Voilà pourquoi je mets l'accent sur la culpabilité des femmes dans le rapport. 

L'autre, (""lorsqu'une femme viole un homme""), n'était qu'une explication. Je rencontre des tas de gens qui ne peuvent même pas imaginer le viol d'une femme sur un homme. 


&gt;Deuxième point d'interrogation : pourquoi te bornes-tu à regarder seulement la colonne des 12 derniers mois ? Mettons qu'on compte les ""made to penetrate"" comme des viols. Si on regarde les statistiques concernant toute la vie, on voit qu'il y a eu 21,8M de viols contre femmes et 7M de viols contre hommes.

You can see a good example for that before every major football tournament, when the Germans are talking about their usual roles as favorites and ""reaching the semi-finals"" as minimal goal. Immediately you hear Austrians complaining about the German arrogance and their ""Präpotenz"" (nice word by the way!). But what do you expect us to say? We have a world-class team. We have been in five semi-finals (or better) out of six tournaments since 2002. What did you expect us to say before this years World Cup? That surviving the group stage would be a success?

The other way around I see a lot of Austrian ""arrogance"" (I'd rather call it well deserved confidence) when it comes to winter sports.

That said, ultimately it's always the people in the country who has to do most of the fighting in liberating themselves so most of our efforts should be focused on providing aid where they are severely lacking such as proving weapons (although very carefully) and air support, intelligence and the like.

It will not be as precise and clean, as a couple hundred other random genes will also come along. But it will not be GM, so it will not be subject to 10 year legal battless for obtaining permits, and other extra tight regulation.

Yes, before the illegal annexation by Russia the tourism industry was booming in Crimea.

&gt; Now the tourists are Russians who have to either fly to Crimea or take the ferry. 

Right, now the only tourists are Russians and there's only few of them.

Now, to return to my earlier question to you:  
**Are you sure decline in tourism is not because of lack of tourists?**

Could you please take your time to answer.

&gt; The ferry is overcrowded. One of the complaints I've heard on twitter is that people stand up for hours before getting to Crimea and then stand up hours when going back. The only other to travel would be through Ukraine, which isn't an option.

Horrible, horrible. Illegally invading and annexing part of a sovereign country should certainly not be that burdersome to anyone, never mind to Russia which promised to uphold and even protect Ukraine's independence and territorial integrity. It's just so unfair.

&gt; The bridge isn't a new idea. 

Yes, I know. I also did mention the WWII bridge. And the obvious lack of any such bridges by glorious Soviet/Russian engineering.

&gt; Russia wanted it before but Ukraine stalled on it since Crimea is mainly pro-Russian and you know they were afraid they were going to lose it. 

What do you take me for, an idiot? The world knows about the 2010 agreement, you know. Perhaps it's just you who don't.

&gt; Now it's different. Russia controls both ends of the Straits, they have the money and they also have the desire. 

Well, considering the fact that no bridge has been nor is being built I for one am not sure if they have neither of those. They haven't even started yet. Do you actually believe such bridge would or even could be built in mere two years? Three years? Or even five years?

&gt; The ones who will actually be doing the building will be the Chinese. China has been spending the past ten years in mass infrastructure projects. They've built longer and more complex bridges. 

Yes, Chinese engineers could probably be able to build it.

&gt; Yes I do think it will happen, the Chinese aren't going to embarrass themselves and Russia needs the bridge.

Why would the Chinese be embarassed over Putin's overtly optimistic promises?

&gt; Who knows what will happen.

That pretty much sums it up.

&gt; They can probably live off Russia alone since their economy previously relied on tourists from Ukraine. Since Russia is bigger population wise and wealthier.


Well, they pretty much *have to* live off Russia alone. In Russia it has led to raising utility rates, canceling major infrastructure projects, tapping the pension funds, cutting wages of public sector workers etc. And to the Putin plan of Crimea with blackjack and hookers. 

&gt; Either Russia finances is actually some of the best in Europe. Remember during the economic crisis when they were facing a steep recession, they still had money to loan out.

Is the ""best in Europe"" the reason no-one want's to buy it? Russia's bond sales have been failing for months: [Putin Pushes Untradeable Notes as Bond Sales Fail](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-27/putin-pushes-untradeable-notes-as-bond-sales-fail-russia-credit.html)

&gt; Ossetia and Abkhazia isn't controlled by Russia you know? 

No, I didn't know that.

&gt; It's controlled by people who are loyal to Russia but they run their own affairs. 

Ah! They're not controlled by Russia, they're merely controlled by people controlled by Russia. Well, surely that changes everything. Except my point how Putin glorioulsy broke his promises regarding South Ossetia's glorious future. After his invasion: it's a shithole. 

(I'm not a one that likes generalisations but that actually has been and is the historical trend with Russian invasions: Rich country/well to do country/ or even poor country -&gt; Russia invades -&gt; Russia controls -&gt; oppressive shithole. It's as if there's a magic touch or something..)

It was unbearable, just thinking about the misery poor Russians had to endure and especially the suffering during WWI, man, Rasputin and attacks on German machineguns with wooden guns, mass murders of hungry workers of StPetrsbourg, you name it, there was no other possibility for russians but to go full retard, kill the tsar and bring someone like Lenin.",0,1407538836,null,0,false,0,cjkypi1,t3_2cymq1,t1_cjkypi1,t1_cjkrpdp,null,1435144838,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt; R : A mon sens la première cause est la disparition de la famille lignagère. L’individu se recroqueville sur son chétif ego et ne se préoccupe plus de ce qui dépasse la durée de sa vie. Le féminisme moderne, qui participe de cet égoïsme, porte aussi une grande part de responsabilité. Il met à mal l’instinct maternel. Il inverse pour les femmes l’importance relative de la maternité et de l’accomplissement professionnel. Au lieu d’être considérée comme la mission principale, prioritaire, autour de laquelle doit s’organiser la vie d’une femme, la procréation est devenue mission secondaire, accomplie quand elle ne contrarie pas d’autres ambitions. « Un enfant, si je veux, quand je veux. » Quand j’aurai le temps et je n’ai pas souvent le temps. Maintes  contraintes matérielles dissuadent les parents de mettre au monde de nombreux enfants : pas de logements adaptés, pas de voitures bon marché de plus de cinq places, fiscalité inéquitable.

Georgia and Armenia are situated south of the Caucasus mountain range, making them West Asia countries. However, their cultures and history have strong ties with Europe and are considered among the oldest countries in Europe. So, 'Eurasian' is probably the best way to describe them.

Kazakhstan on the other hand is more Asian than European, because it's culturally tied with Asia and the Middle East, geographically - a small part of the country is in West of the Ural river, where the Eastern-most point of Europe is.

On en parle, à cause des antiféministes comme moi qui lisent entre les lignes. On peut attendre longtemps avant que les féministes en parlent. T'as rien à dire sur le fait que la conclusion de  ce rapport donne une mauvaise idée de la victimisation des hommes? 


&gt;En revanche, de ""mettre l'accent sur la culpabilité des femmes"" au sujet d'un rapport qui indique qu'elles sont violées deux fois plus souvent par les hommes que le contraire me paraît assez saugrenu.

Pourquoi je discuterais une position sur laquelle toi, moi et le reste de la société sont d'accord? Les hommes forment la majorité des violeurs et tout le monde le sait. 

Alors oui, j'insiste sur les points que la société, jusqu'à présent, a ignoré. 


&gt;l'idée qu'un homme ne peut se faire violer par une femme est une notion machiste.  C'est des discours sexistes sur les rôles des genres (les hommes viriles, les femmes passives, etc.) qui véhiculent ce mythe que tu détestes tant. Si la définition ""faire pénétrer"" du viol n'est pas entériné dans la loi, ce n'est pas à cause du féminisme.

Je ne sais pas si c'est machiste, mais en tout cas c'est traditionnel. Ils ont toujours été ignorés.

Auf [Amazon](http://www.amazon.de/Expedition-zum-Ursprung-Physiker-Lebens/dp/3417263174) lautet die Beschreibung:
  
&gt;Warum leben wir Menschen? Was steht hinter diesem allen? Wie ist die Welt entstanden? Und gibt es einen Ursprung aller Dinge? Schon als Jugendlicher beschäftigt sich Albrecht Kellner mit diesen Fragen. Daher schreibt er sich voller Elan für das Studium der Physik ein. Doch schon bald muss er feststellen, dass die Naturwissenschaft zwar viele Phänomene auf kompakte mathematische Modelle zurückführen kann, es aber nicht vermag, sie letztgültig zu erklären. Seine Suche geht weiter: Er experimentiert mit bewusstseinserweiternden Mitteln, erlernt Methoden der Transzendentalen Meditation und des Hellsehens und beschäftigt sich mit fernöstlichen Weisheitslehren. Doch nichts scheint ihn seinem Ziel wirklich näherzubringen. Bis er auf jemanden stößt, der ihm die Lektüre der Bibel empfiehlt. Zu seiner Überraschung findet er hier einen Weg, der sich radikal von allen seinen bisherigen Versuchen unterscheidet, und gelangt schließlich tatsächlich an das Ende seiner Reise.
  
Wenn wir es bezüglich der Entstehung der Welt mit einer unendlichen, ewigen Ursache-Wirkungskette zu tun haben, die wir nicht naturwissenschaftlich beschreiben können, haben wir ein übernatürliches Phänomen entdeckt.
  
Ähnlich wie Kellner es tut, wird im kurzen Video [""The Creation Story""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGj25iARyYM) dargestellt, das biblischer Schöpfungsbericht und naturwissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse durchaus vereinbar sind.
  
Weit tiefgründigere Gedanken über die Vereinbarkeit von christlichem Glauben und Naturwissenschaft haben sich christliche Wissenschaftler als Teil der Biologos Foundation, die die theistische Evolution vertritt und vom ehemaligen Leiter des Human-Genom-Projekts [Francis Collins](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Collins) gegründet wurde, gemacht. Unter ihren [Common Questions](http://biologos.org/questions) finden sich die sehr aufschlussreichen Artikel [""Are science and Christianity at war?""](http://biologos.org/questions/science-and-religion) und [""Can science and scripture be reconciled?""](http://biologos.org/questions/scientific-and-scriptural-truth).

true,Splatterh0use,null,null,"&gt; L'intolleranza diffusa è stata spesso cavalcata dai partiti politici, che hanno usato i rom come merce di scambio per vincere le elezioni. La maggior parte delle volte è stata “l'emergenza sicurezza” a essere tirata in ballo, talvolta per giustificare sgomberi da parte delle amministrazioni, di frequente sull'onda di fatti cronaca.

Ho visto solo la Lega farlo in specifiche occasioni di populismo. I malumori sui rom li senti dalle persone che hanno subito furti o violenze da loro.

&gt; L'isteria zingari si è trasformata spesso in episodi di violenza inaudita. Lo scorso ottobre a Napoli, una bambino rom di due anni è stato colpito da una pioggia d'acido proveniente da un balcone mentre camminava per strada con la madre. Qualche mese dopo, sempre a Napoli, il campo di Poggioreale è stato dato alle fiamme durante la notte. La sera del 25 aprile scorso, invece, a Latina, quattro minorenni rom sono stati presi a schiaffi e calci da una ronda di 15 persone composta da cittadini e forze dell'ordine. 

Ve la ricordate [questa](http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/ubriaco-uccise-quattro-ragazzi-pena-sei-anni-residence.html)? Quattro ragazzini uccisi tra le fiamme dei loro scooter investiti dal rom ubriaco; sei anni di pena per aver tolto la vita a quei poveracci che stavano andando solo a prendersi il gelato.
Dov'è l'isteria? Quando ti ammazzano il figlio che cosa ti rimane? Cosa devono fare le famiglie?

Corrige-moi si je me trompe mais il me semble que l'idée de nation renvoie à un peuple, un territoire, une langue et une culture.

I answered to another post you made. The short of it is: everyone is targeted.

&gt; how did they steal the 60 million euros

It's pretty complicated. Voiculescu was a prominent member of the communist regime. The 1989 Revolution found him in a top position in one of the companies used by the Securitate (the hugely powerful political police) to do business with companies outside Romania. At that time he was mature, very well connected, which was something of critical importance in post-communist Romania, and there is a very strong suspicion he managed to steal some huge - for the time - sums of foreign money from that company (the actions are pretty much untraceable now).

During the '90s he built a web of commercial and media companies and started a political party. Using his connections and malevolent intelligence (which he has plenty of, both native and schooled at Securitate) he managed to place critically important pawns in governments, over time. Finally, around 2003, with help from some pawns which were sentenced along with him today, he managed to hit the big time. He managed to orchestrate a corrupt privatization of state properties that ended up with him buying for 100000 EUR properties worth ~ 7 million EUR at the time and upwards of 40 million only 2-3 years afterwards, without taking under account a looong list of buildings built on those properties, which he also managed to grab. The total damages to the state is 60 million EUR.

Since 2005, he deviously used this money to explosively fund his media companies, which became critically important for politicians willing to submit to his will to gain screen-time during which any moderator would always ask just the right questions and had just the right attitude on various issues, which led to him gaining even more political power without any significant traction in elections (his party always hovered around 3%).

At the height of his power, some said he was credited to have around 1.5 billion EUR in cash and valuables and today it's estimated he has between 120 - 300 million EUR. But money is not power. This guy understood that money is just a facilitator. He really knew how to entrap politicians, partners and employees. The contracts his media employees sign are mind-blowing. Basically, once they sign, they can't ever say anything wrong about him, his companies and his partner companies without being threatened with life altering lawsuits. He managed to entrap most of his top pawns through private debts, by loaning them with 100.000 - 300.000 EUR at very convenient rates, thus ensuring that they better toe the line he needs or else he may suddenly realize he needs to be payed back.

This was a guy that was bred and raised by the Securitate. The degree and refinement of the malevolence within him is simply unimaginable to normal human beings.",0,1407549328,null,0,false,0,cjl39h9,t3_2cz3l0,t1_cjl39h9,t1_cjl293j,null,1435147057,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,dorinmaxmilian,null,null,"&gt; So who is behind the recent convictions?

History is behind them. We finally managed to catch 25 years without any outside power holding a boot on our neck.

After ascending to EU and NATO things started to change, structurally, in Romania. This kind of change doesn't happen without someone much stronger than you telling how it's done. And this is exactly what happened.

EU requested us to change legislation to protect values shared by all EU members, especially those related to a functional democratic republic. EU also kept a close eye to any deviations from these values, which is something that very nearly happened a couple times over the last years, because the current crop of politicians are driven to despair by what happens around them. EU was pivotal to keep things in check. Meanwhile, the USA sees Romania as a critically important partner in South-Eastern Europe, kind of like Poland is in the east. You can't have a partner that is reliable across multiple political mandates without a functional democratic state so they helped our intelligence and military services to evolve and they also kept a strong pressure on the government through the USA ambassadors.

Put all of them together and you get a state that started to work. There is still a mountain of problems to attack, mostly because there are still MANY MANY politicians which have a very hard time to accept that politics is for the people and not for their personal gain and because most of the state employees are just abysmally inefficient and at least slightly corrupted.

However, you can feel it in the water that things are deeply changing. We are still a generation away from having a decent state, one that can be relied upon to remain steady even without outside monitoring, but there has never been a better time in Romanian history. With the current EU and NATO partnerships, there is strong reason to believe we will get there over the next 25 years.

true,dorinmaxmilian,null,null,"&gt; Romania is more like the UK then you probably think

Corruption is the same universally. What's different is the magnitude it manifests itself with. In Romania it used to be - and often still is - grotesque. Even today, Ponta, the piece of shit prime minister of ours, seeing his support from the media companies owned by Voiculescu in danger (since their bo$$ went to jail for 10 years while he is PM), posted a disgusting message on his Facebook account, supporting ""journalism"" and directly sucking up to these media companies, just to ensure he has a solid outlet for propaganda during his upcoming campaign for presidency. It's unlikely you'll see something like that in the UK. Politicians have some boundaries that they do not cross when it comes to **potential** image / legal issues and the people of UK are those establishing those boundaries.

&gt; the problem you face with the Gypsy population

This is another VERY difficult problem with the root being their isolation. They live in a society of their own that is very archaic, tribal and working in parallel with the real society. To top it all off, the ones causing troubles are nomadic and they tend to move as soon as the real society tries to integrate them in any way.

Nobody gave a shit about these people for at least 150 years (that's how much it elapsed since slavery was abolished in Romania). They were left uneducated, without any chance of gaining a large number of educated, role-model individuals and thus they formed a culture of survival based on a very archaic set of values. These values are fully incompatible with the EU. Gypsies value to the extreme the ability to make money ""off the land"" and feel no connection whatsoever with the real society around them. This means they steal public property, they indulge in petty theft, they live like rats in makeshift cottages, they value cunningness and any native skills and despise education, honest work and settling down. They even see their own time in this world as a commodity that can be spent in jail if the return of investment is good enough.

The only solution to the problem is, obviously, to integrate them in society so they can live like normal people. However, there is a mountain of issues that prevent this and they can all be summarized as ""gypsies are a low priority"". To integrate such a numerous group you need to invest large amounts of money in people and programs that can really change them, over large periods of time (at least one, 25 year generation). Who has the ability and money for that? In Romania we certainly don't because there are so many other issues that are of higher priority. It's unimaginable that any Romanian politician will risk his neck to seriously support a gypsy integration program just because nobody would vote for something like that, even before discussing the huge sums involved.

In my opinion, this problem can only be solved efficiently and as promptly as possible, at the EU level. It would be MUCH easier to develop and fund programs with a decent chance of success at the EU level and then involve all the countries with significant gypsy population than rely on these countries solving this problem by themselves at some point. Meanwhile, beside the carrot, the stick must also be firmly used. It's important to acknowledge most adult gypsies will do ABSOLUTELY everything in their power to remain outside the normal society. For them, the only solution will be incarceration when even petty offenses are repeated across the EU, not just in one country.

true,MauvaisConseil,croixlorraine,Croix de Lorraine,"&gt; J'ai simplement fait ce que tu n'aurais jamais fait car tu n'exprimes tes opinions que lorsque le risque de la sanction ou de la conséquence est nul.

Lesquelles de mes opinions me vaudraient des sanctions ? Je te soupçonne de me prêter des opinions que je n'ai pas.

&gt;La question que j'aurais à te poser, c'est que t'apporte de passer tout ton temps à taper des conneries pré-mâchées sur le web. 

Je partage mes idées, à l'intérieur du FN, mais aussi à l'extérieur. Sur reddit, ça me permet de les poser à l'écrit, avec des sources, de voir les arguments contre, de voir leur popularité, et de réfléchir à des améliorations pour mieux les maîtriser à l'oral. 

Parallèlement, je suis convaincu qu'il reste à gagner la bataille des idées dans les classes supérieures. Pour les classes populaires, c'est à mon avis déjà fait sur l'UE et l'immigration. Il reste un gros travail à faire sur l'individualisme, mais ça prendra probablement des siècles.

J'exprime mon point de vue, souvent partagé par des personnalités extérieures au FN, sur des questions politiques.

En particulier, la sortie de l'euro selon Jacques Sapir, l'opposition au mondial-libéralisme de Maurice Allais, une réduction de la coûteuse immigration non éduquée comme le prouvent le CAE et l'OCDE, et la *certaine idée de la France* et de sa place dans le monde qu'avait de Gaulle, avec les réformes des institutions que cela impose (disons Chouard comme c'est la mode, mais je préfère [Castoriadis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJCq6Vy_YRM)). Je défends aussi le salaire citoyen, avec une démocratie plus directe, comme une sorte de [misthos](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misthos) dans une Athènes du XXIème siècle. Ces thèses s'appuient souvent sur les outils d'analyse de Marx, ce qui engendre une opposition avec la classe dominante que j'appelle l'élite et des médias qu'elle contrôle.

Tant mieux si le FN reprend une partie de ces thèses. J'ai été au Parti de Gauche avant, et certaines de ces thèses y étaient également populaires. Par contre, évidemment, dès que tu parles d'immigration au PdG, tu es traité de fasciste, ce qui n'est pas le cas au FN.

&gt;Je sais que tout tes arguments sont déjà écrits et que tu les recopies à la volée en boucle. 

Tu te trompes sur toute la ligne. Tout ce que j'écris ici vient de moi. Je te mets au défi de retrouver mes propos ailleurs qu'ici.

&gt;Je doute que ça t'aie valu la moindre promotion ou tu ne serais pas encore là à nous les briser. T'es payé au moins ?

Je ne suis pas dans une démarche individualiste. J'avais un très bon salaire d'ingé que j'ai abandonné. C'est probablement quelque chose que tu es incapable de comprendre : le souci du bien commun.

&gt;J'espère que t'attends pas la victoire de Marine pour récupérer ton salaire. C'est un très mauvais investissement.

Je ne crois pas que le FN, même remanié et avec un nouveau nom, sera un jour au pouvoir. L'enjeu est plutôt de secouer les élites pour obtenir des changements avant qu'il ne soit trop tard (c'est à dire la guerre civile ou bien la dissolution de la France).

&gt;J'ai aussi du mal à voir ce que tu retires de propager la haine de ton voisin et de ton prochain

C'est tout l'inverse. Je ne propage aucune haine. La haine vient plutôt des commentaires que je reçois.

Il n'y a aucun avenir pour les immigrés pauvres et non éduqués dans un pays avec 5 millions de chômeurs et 8 millions de pauvres. Les nouvelles arrivées de personnes pauvres et non éduquées ne font que fragiliser un pays au bord de l'explosion. Aucune haine dans mes positions, simplement du réalisme : la France se doit de les refuser pour continuer d'exister ; ce qui n'est d'ailleurs que l'expression de la volonté du peuple français.

&gt;Cela n'est ni glorieux, ni distrayant, cela ne te fait pas grandir intellectuellement et cela contribue à foutre la société en l'air.

Encore une fois, ce qui contribue à foutre la société en l'air, c'est l'individualisme et son corollaire communautariste, au lieu du souci du bien commun.

&gt;L'internement point le bout de son nez quand tu t'apercevras que tu as sérieusement cru que faire chier des geeks de moins de 25 ans et d'être connu comme le raciste en chef d'une sous-partie d'un site anglo-saxon était du temps bien employé

Comme si c'était ma seule activité : viens faire une campagne ; va te balader dans la France profonde ; parle aux gens ; confronte toi au désespoir et à la colère.

true,aldhelm,null,null,"&gt; Yes, before the illegal annexation by Russia the tourism industry was booming in Crimea.

No one is disputing that. Other than the tourism industry though, Ukraine had nothing much to offer Crimea. Ukraine has been stagnating and going for the past twenty years unlike Russia.

&gt;Now, to return to my earlier question to you:
Are you sure decline in tourism is not because of lack of tourists?
Could you please take your time to answer......
Horrible, horrible. Illegally invading and annexing part of a sovereign country should certainly not be that burdersome to anyone, never mind to Russia which promised to uphold and even protect Ukraine's independence and territorial integrity. It's just so unfair.

I really don't get you. Are you so busy about condemning the Russian invasion that your having a brain fart? Of course a lack of tourists would cause a decline in tourists. It's like saying a lack of water causes drought. Also why the hell are you getting into a mini rant about the annexation. It happened, there is nothing you, or I can do about it in r/europe. This discussion is about Crimea's future not a soapbox for airing out views like an old marxists dreaming of a revolution.

&gt;Why would the Chinese be embarassed over Putin's overtly optimistic promises?

International prestige. It's one thing when a Chinese company screws up in China, they would be able to easily hush it up and splash some more cash. This time they are in Russia and spending Russian money. Since China wants to get more contracts for infrastructure development in Russia, this bridge failing would be a bad signal.

&gt;Well, they pretty much have to live off Russia alone. In Russia it has led to raising utility rates, canceling major infrastructure projects, tapping the pension funds, cutting wages of public sector workers etc. And to the Putin plan of Crimea with blackjack and hookers. 

That is because Russia will have to spend a lot of money on it to make it modern. As I said Ukraine has been stagnating for the past twenty years. The development of Crimea hasn't been a priority other than looking for shale gas in the black sea. Russia has a clean financial record, one of the best in Europe and they want to keep it. However that isn't possible with the amount of money they are going to have to splash on Crimea to develop it.

&gt;Is the ""best in Europe"" the reason no-one want's to buy it? Russia's bond sales have been failing for months: Putin Pushes Untradeable Notes as Bond Sales Fail

Come on, are you doing this on purpose or just this dumb? We both know there is a political crisis going on along with sanctions. People who invest in Russia and buy bonds don't just look at Russias financial record, they also look at political risk.

&gt;Ah! They're not controlled by Russia, they're merely controlled by people controlled by Russia. Well, surely that changes everything. Except my point how Putin glorioulsy broke his promises regarding South Ossetia's glorious future. After his invasion: it's a shithole.
(I'm not a one that likes generalisations but that actually has been and is the historical trend with Russian invasions: Rich country/well to do country/ or even poor country -&gt; Russia invades -&gt; Russia controls -&gt; oppressive shithole. It's as if there's a magic touch or something..)

Ugh I swear to god you are doing this on purpose. There is a MASSIVE difference between having puppets and actually controlling a territory. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are American puppets. Are they part of the US? Jordan is an American puppet, are they part of the US? Of course not. They run their own affairs but they know which political lines to follow.

Also both of these places where shitholes. You must not know about them if you consider them to be rich. They were part of Georgia (also a shithole) and they rebelled for ethnic reasons. Which meant they became even more of a shithole. Russia has been splashing money on them and they've been spending it. If they remain shitholes in ten years then it would be the fault of the local leaders. 

&gt;According to the world and also international laws: No, it isn't.

Ok stop this, seriously. We are not debating about international recognition here. We are talking about Crimeas future in Russia. It's a done deal and de facto reality. Whether it is internationally accepted has nothing to do with Russias plan for development.

&gt;What do you take me for, an idiot? The world knows about the 2010 agreement, you know. Perhaps it's just you who don't.

Mandarin is a tonal language, meaning the pitch at which you say things affects its meaning. On that basis alone, nevermind the syntax or the non-Latin alphabet or the pronunciation, it is a very difficult language challenge for someone who isn't used to programming sounds in that way.

I agree it must be atleast partly funded by larger EU nations who have the money to do so but until France, Germany, Spain, the UK and Italy start recovering I fear this issue may be sidelined as most do not have the money to spare. I know the UK doesn't have an answer because our policy towards Irish travelers is to just let them do what they want and hope they go away from whatever part of the country they are in. No efforts are made at integration properly.

It would be difficult to do at the EU level, you and I both know it takes France and Germany to effected for a quick solution to happen. I agree completely that education is key for Gypsey community. I have no doubts tere will be resistance to it from the Gypsey community but as you said being not apart of society from so long and nobody caring for so long will indeed make efforts to integrate them very difficult.

That is a very complicated question. When /u/dorinmaxmilian said that Basescu doesn't control the government anymore, he's right but not in the sense you're taking it. The history of Basescu's Presidency goes something like this:

After the mass election in 2004, Basescu won the Presidency and the political alliance that supported him won enough votes in Parliament that by forming alliances with other parties they were able to form a government.

During this period Romania was not yet in the EU(EU accession for Romania was on Jan 1st 2007) and as such the EU was putting on a massive amount of pressure to get an independent functioning Justice system going. A lot of very important laws were passed during this time due to this pressure, one of them massively buffed up the DNA(special anticorruption prosecutors) which before this change were very ineffective and toothless. The new leaders put in these places were much newer people, that had no/or a lot less ties with the older political operatives. 

You have to realize that all of these changes take time and even more important than changing laws, is changing mentality and changing the people. The old guard wasn't sitting around doing nothing, it was fighting back at every step and corrupt and corruptable people still worked in the system, because throwing them out required proof and motive and that's a lot harder to come by than just changing a few laws.

Additionally to the **slowly** changing of the Justice system was the complete clean up of the Internal Security Service. This is actually one of the things Basescu did right most of all, but it's not something that get recognized a lot mostly because it was done covertly, as most intelligence operations go. Before Basescu the intelligence service was full of people loyal to the former President(Iliescu) and the former nomenclature, most of them were actually still active from the time the communist Securitate existed. As President and head of the Supreme Council for the Defense of the State(CSAT) he had a much more executive role in the changes and the cleanup of the Intelligence services, he put people in charge that depending on who you ask will tell you they are professionals and competent(Basescu's supporters) or incompetent and they are there to do Basescu's orders(Basescu's political enemies).

Which of those is true, is not clear, I guess we'll see when Basecu is no longer President, but given that the Intelligence Services operate closely with friendly foreign agencies and are trusted by these allies to perform their tasks correctly, I would guess the people that really are leading these things do know what they are doing.

Why cleaning up the Internal Intelligence Service is important you ask? It's simple, after the buff to the DNA initially investigations were conducted with the technical help from the Police(wire taps, recording, etc) and the Police was and still very much is one of the most corrupt institutions there are and those that were being investigated had a tendency to find out they were investigated and evidence tended to ""get misplaced"".

The DNA seeing this, removed the Police almost completely from investigations and started using the SRI(Internal intelligence service) to gather proof for their investigations. After the cleanup of the intelligence services there were no more(better said a lot less) leaks about investigations and evidence stopped going missing.

After EU accession at the start of 2007, the Prime Minister(who was from a different party than Basescu) removed the party Basescu came from from the government and with the help of the PSD(former communist party) was able to survive as a minority government. In exchange for this support there were an effort to have Basescu removed from the Presidency(This is legally possible, but Parliament can only suspend the President for a very short time, to remove him a Referendum is required). Parliament suspended Basescu in spring 2007, but the Referendum failed spectacularly and Basescu was reinstated a month later.

During the 2007-2009 period there was a general institutional gridlock between the Prime Minister and Parliament on one side and the President on the other. Due to the way the Constitution is written the President has only very limited executive powers, but he does have a semi-veto power and the ability to protect the intelligence services from unwanted changes.

While this period Basescu's political enemies controlled both the Government and the Parliament but still had almost no control over the intelligence services and the Justice system was already set up self sufficiently enough that to change it required passing new laws which were either vetoed by Basescu or by the Constitutional Court. so even though his enemies were in power, they didn't have enough power that they could do whatever they wanted.

At the end of 2008 there were elections for Parliament and Basescu was able to help his party gain the Government and during the 2009-2012 years the DNA&amp;SRI duo really started to hurt, politicians started to see that they weren't untouchable, the first real corruption cases were in this period.

In the spring of 2012, due to the economic crises and the very unpopular austerity measures implemented Basescu's party lost the Government and his political enemies were again in power. They tried again to have him removed from the Presidency, just like in 2007, but again they failed to get the required number of votes in the Referendum and Basescu again returned as President. What's important to note from this is that during the month that Basescu was suspended and the Referendum happened his enemies tried changing any law they thought would help them win a Referendum, but do to **MASSIVE** pressure and backlash from the EU and US they were unsuccessful.

Since that moment in 2012 we've been in a situation similar to the 2007-2009 period, his Basescu political enemies control Parliament and the Government, but unable to remove Basescu and unable to make significant changes to the intelligence services or the Judicial system.

Over the years the DNA&amp;SRI duo matured and being protected for such a long time from political machinations, started working, at first not as effectively and slower, but as experience was gained the prosecutors gained more confidence and independence, hopefully enough independence that it will continue to work even when Basescu is no longer President.

So in closing, it's true that Basescu doesn't control the government, but he still has enough leverage to block attempts by his political enemies to make any significant changes to the Justice system. Also, it's worth noting that without the pressure from the EU and US, none of this would have happened.

If you are unable to demonstrate that the signature on the freight bill was forged and does not, in fact, originate from your flatmate's hand, your claims will end up being directed at your flatmate, which certainly is an uncomfortable position.

A cardinal obligation of a freight company is to deliver it to the correct recipient, and there is a wealth of conflicting case law, all the way from OLG  Cologne and OLG Düsseldorf stating that delivery to a neighbor is insufficient, to other courts which say that it is, in fact, acceptable.

OLG Cologne and OLG Düsseldorf, as I said, discuss the case where it is delivered to a neighbor, not (ostensibly) to someone living in your flat. So I would add the caveat that if delivery is performed to someone in your flat, it would perhaps qualify as having been performed to the correct recipient due to a de facto proxy agent relationship between flatmates.

This part contained the eastern part of modern Belgium, a slice of the south of modern Netherlands, and a bit of modern Germany.

The new Gallia Belgica included the modern cities of Cambrai, Arras, Amiens, Reims, Metz and Trier.

Emperor Diocletian restructured the provinces once more around 300, and split Belgica into two provinces: Belgica Prima and Belgica Secunda.

You mean an old guy hiding in a cave in Pakistan arbitrarily decided to take away their al Qaeda certification this past February? That's kind of a meaningless gesture.

Ultimately they are the biggest game in town (in large part due to the influx of al Qaeda militants from across the world during the Syrian civil war).

true,MrKnot,null,null,"&gt; Cantor ha classificato gli infiniti secondo diversi ordini di grandezza, per cui x∞ &lt; ∞x

Se per x∞ intendi un numero reale moltiplicato per l'infinito, questa è una espressione ridondante. Eccettuato x=0 (che come saprai crea problemi), l'espressione ""x volte l'infinito"" è uguale a un infinito dello stesso ordine.

&gt; Ci sono indubbiamente infiniti numeri reali tra ciascuna unità razionale o intera, ma all'infinito (negativo o positivo) c'è un'infinità di numeri in più.

No, proprio no, mi spiace. L'ho scritto ieri in breve a msx, oggi (che sono al pc invece che al cellullare) lo spiego più estesamente.

E' chiaro che non si può semplicemente ""contare"" quanto è grande un insieme infinito. Quello che si può fare è confrontare due infiniti e vedere quanto sono grandi fra di loro, in questo modo: se è possibile trovare una funzione biunivoca fra i due insiemi infiniti che copra *tutti* i loro elementi, allora i due insiemi sono grandi uguali. Se invece uno dei due insiemi ha sempre almeno un elemento che non può essere collegato a un elemento dell'altro, allora il suo infinito è più grande.

La nostra questione quindi è: esiste una funzione biunivoca che colleghi l'insieme dei numeri ""ragionevoli"", ad esempio i reali fra 0 e 100) all'intero insieme dei numeri reali?

In my experience there seems to be a huge gap between undergrad and postgrad students in the way they master the language, and I attribute this to the fact that researchers have to publish papers constantly, for an international audience, and that standards are therefore higher. 

I heard that a lot of Quebecers whose first language is French also flunk the test, probably because they assume it is just a comprehension test. From what I've seen (just had a quick glance) it is more about whether you understand the theory and intricacies of grammar, syntax and structure of the language. There is vocabulary, of course, but the emphasis on the theoretical aspect is obvious.

I'm very pro EU to the point where I hope that 100 - 200 years from now, Europe will be a single country. To me, the French-German partnership is the EU's beating heart. They were at the core of EU's birth, they pushed for progress over all these years and, when the shit hit the fan in 2007, they were the rock in the storm (I will not forget their position on EUR and just how unequivocally - and even threateningly - they spoke about ""The EUR is here to stay""). So I have no issue with their position, I consider it normal and I admire them beyond words for managing to turn history on its head and become so much more than the already impressive sum of two great nations.

As for UK's position... it saddens me. I always maintain some hope that UK will, many years from now, take its high place at the EU table and leave behind the scars that currently keep it on the sidelines. I'm convinced UK still regards itself as a much bigger player than it is, with Europe simply being too small for UK's aspirations, thinking it somehow can remain a nexus where large power fluxes meet and the UK can wisely control them simply because UK is very smart and very special. As years go by it becomes harder and harder to maintain the illusion of this position in the hearts and minds of the British people. During the crisis it was dead obvious that US will not take kindly having UK outside the EU and FR-DE will not let UK maintain an unregulated financial heaven just because it wants to. If UK would commit to fusing into the EU, it would naturally become its 3rd equal foot. I hope that happens but it would be stupid to hold my breath about it. And maybe the next crisis will not find Spain and Italy with their pants down, barely able to sustain themselves let alone help others.

Relis la citation de Rosa Luxembourg.

Les députés sociaux-démocrates étaient parfaitement au courant que la guerre allait ravager l'Europe pour rien, et craignaient une opposition à la guerre venant des travailleurs. 

Quelques jours à peine avant le vote au parlement du 4 Août, des centaines de milliers de personnes avaient manifesté contre la guerre à Berlin.

Dans son appel à manifester, le SPD avait écrit le 25 juillet: *""Au nom de l’humanité et de la culture, le prolétariat allemand conscient se déclare fermement opposé aux activités criminelles des fauteurs de guerre. Nous exigeons instamment du gouvernement allemand qu’il pèse de tout son poids sur le gouvernement autrichien pour le maintien de la paix et, si cette guerre honteuse ne pouvait être empêchée, de s’abstenir de se mêler au conflit. Aucune goutte de sang d’un soldat allemand ne doit être sacrifiée aux intrigues ambitieuses des dirigeants autrichiens au pouvoir au nom du profit et des intérêts impérialistes.""*

Cet appel était pleinement conforme à la ligne officielle du parti. Pendant plus de quatre décennies, le SPD avait fait l’éducation des ouvriers sur la base du principe de la solidarité internationale et de l’hostilité à l’impérialisme. En novembre 1912, il avait encore joué un rôle dirigeant au congrès de Bâle de la Deuxième Internationale socialiste en appelant expressément les travailleurs européens à s’opposer à la guerre.

Le manifeste du congrès, signé par tous les principaux partis socialistes d’Europe, disait: *""Ce congrès… appelle les ouvriers de tous les pays à opposer à l’impérialisme capitaliste la force de la solidarité internationale du prolétariat.""*

Le manifeste a menacé les *""classes dominantes de tous les États""* de conséquences révolutionnaires en cas de guerre et a lancé l'avertissement suivant: *""Ce serait de la folie pour les gouvernements de ne pas comprendre que la seule pensée du caractère effroyable d’une guerre mondiale provoquera nécessairement l’indignation et la colère de la classe ouvrière. Les prolétaires considèrent comme un crime de tirer les uns sur les autres au profit des capitalistes, des ambitions dynastiques ou à la gloire de traités diplomatiques secrets.""*

Lifted from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_England#Roman_Britain)

&gt; After Caesar's expeditions, the Romans began their real attempt to conquer Britain in 43 AD, at the behest of the Emperor Claudius. They landed in Kent, and defeated two armies led by the kings of the Catuvellauni tribe, Caratacus and Togodumnus, in battles at the Medway and the Thames. Togodumnus was killed, and Caratacus fled to Wales. The Roman force, led by Aulus Plautius, then halted as Plautius sent for Claudius to come and finish the campaign. When Claudius arrived he led the final march on the Catuvellauni capital at Camulodunum, before returning to Rome again for his triumph. The Catuvellauni at this time held sway over the most of the southeastern corner of England; eleven local rulers surrendered, a number of client kingdoms were established, and the rest became a Roman province with Camulodunum as its capital.

Over the next four years, the territory was consolidated and the future emperor Vespasian led a campaign into the Southwest where he subjugated two more tribes. By 54 AD the border had been pushed back to the Severn and the Trent, and campaigns were underway to subjugate Northern England and Wales. In 60 AD however, under the leadership of the warrior-queen Boudicca, the tribes rose in revolt against the Romans. Camulodunum was burned to the ground, as well as Londinium and Verulamium, there is some archaeological evidence that the same happened at Winchester as well, and the Second Legion Augusta, stationed at Exeter, refused to move for fear of revolt among the locals there as well. The governor however, Suetonius Paulinus, marched back from his campaign in Wales to face Boudicca in battle. There was a substantial engagement, somewhere along the line of Watling Street, at the end of which Boudicca was utterly defeated. The province was pacified once more.
Over the next twenty years the borders expanded but little, but the governorship of Agricola saw the last pockets of independence in Wales and Northern England finally incorporated into the province. He also led a campaign into Scotland, but from these conquests he was recalled by the Emperor Domitian, and the border gradually solidified along the line of the Stanegate in Northern England. Hadrian's Wall was built along this line in 138 AD; apart from a number of temporary forays into Scotland, this was now the border. The Romans, and their culture, were here to stay; over the course of their three hundred and fifty years in charge, England's landscape would become ubiquitously impregnated with traces of their presence.",0,1407580482,null,0,false,0,cjlbxue,t3_2d244y,t1_cjlbxue,t3_2d244y,null,1435151314,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Cerco di non dare pareri, ma racconto una cosa successa su un intervento per il 118. Siamo usciti per una ragazza con poco più di vent'anni gravida (ma non ricordo il motivo preciso della chiamata, ma non è importante, non era niente di particolarmente urgente), ci hanno aspettato sul ciglio della strada appena fuori dal campo. Come in ogni servizio in strada, se è possibile, facciamo salire il paziente sull'ambulanza , gli prendiamo due parametri mentre cerchiamo di capire il problema per poi comunicarlo alla centrale 118 che ci assegna un ospedale di destinazione. Per cui appena arrivato sul posto aiuto la ragazza a salire sull'ambulanza e comunico alle 5 o 6 persone che sono con lei che in 5 minuti gli dico in che ospedale andiamo e se possiamo trasportare un'altra persona in più con noi (parente, amico, chiunque l'assistito voglia). Così sto solo con la paziente e una soccorritrice in ambulanza per non più di 5 minuti, metto la testa fuori dal mezzo per dare qualche informazione e fuori non c'era più nessuno! Dileguati! La ragazza (incinta) era sola con noi. Loro non sapevano neanche in che ospedale l'avremmo portata!   
È un episodio che non mi riesco a spiegare. 

Poi ci sono altri episodi che avranno vissuto un po' tutti, tipo aver ricevuto insulti a gratis mentre li incroci per strada (non sempre ovviamente), impennata di furti di biciclette nella zona del campo rom...

Comuni tipo Legnano hanno avviato iniziative per facilitare l'integrazione delle famiglie rom dandogli un tetto (classico container) , ma l'adesione era lontana dal 100%.

Another video showed what was said to be a mass burial of victims.The U.S. State Department later published satellite photos said to show mass graves in Syria that line up with images from the ground supplied by Syrian opposition forces.

true,OnkelMickwald,SWED,But a simple lad from Sweden,"Germanic tribes in the southern half (third?) of the country, ish, probably Finnic tribes along the coast of the northern parts, proto-Sami hunter gatherers in the other areas.

This era also saw material and very possibly cultural changes influenced by the Roman empire in the southern, Germanic part. During this period and the following migration period, religious centra seemed to shift from bogs and groves to temples. People started building large halls, thrones, fortresses. The variation in size of farm houses increased, the largest farm houses became larger, an indicator of increased social differences.

Perhaps young men traveled to the Roman empire to be hired as auxiliaries and came back with new influences and new attitudes towards society. They had seen the centurions, generals, governors and heard about the Emperor, they had seen a world where power came from individual, powerful men surrounded by a retinue of professional warriors, perhaps it was a slower, more 'seeping' process that radiated from the Germanic lands closer to the Roman border, but possibly it was a combination.

Runes were first used probably in the borderlands between the Roman Empire and Germania and would in time spread to Scandinavia. The Runic alphabet is almost a copy of the [Old Latin alphabet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duenos_inscription).

So in general, a ""latinization"" of the Scandinavian culture was going on, kind of how the 20th and 21st centuries are heavily ""americanized"". It wasn't an assimilation or simple ""copying"" of Latin culture, but Latin culture was absorbed, combined, interpreted and fused with already existing customs into a new culture, and this culture would later ""give birth"" to the Germanic cultures of the migration period and viking age.",0,1407583528,null,0,1407646778,0,cjlcfy7,t3_2d244y,t1_cjlcfy7,t3_2d244y,null,1435151551,19,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,19

The frisians did a bit of trading and kept a lot of cattle and that was about it. 

The core frisian lands (now way outside frisian reach) was occupied at the start of the specified time by the romans and they exacted taxes from the rest of the area. Drusus wanted to expand into germanic lands and laid down some roads, bridges and canals to better transport an army and materiel with although the expansion never really happened, as far as I can tell.

in 28 some new bloke in the area, named Olennius, decided he wanted bigger cow-skins as taxes and commited atrocities to get to it. The frisians then hanged the tax collectors and Olennius fled to the roman castellum at Flevum (whereabouts unkown). The frisians besieged it but retreated when they heard of roman reinforcements and eventually fought [the battle of baduhenna wood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Baduhenna_Wood).

The romans didn't take immediate revenge, only re-establishing their dominion under Corbulo but he had orders to stay behind the Rhine which left the frisians/germanics in the area a territory much larger than is now considered ""frisian"".

In 69 the frisians apparently joined the [revolt of Iulius Civilis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_of_the_Batavi) although didn't do a lot.

After that a whole lot of nothing much happened although the frisians apparently supplied a bunch of auxiliary troops to rome.

By the end of the 3rd century the romans started leaving the area which coincided with a severe depopulation of the area here, so much so that there are no archeological remnants from between the third and fifth centuries. Only in the migration period did new people appear here and they would eventually also end up being called ""Frisians"". 

The original population partially emigrated to the coasts of kent and flanders as the local frisian type of pottery has been found there but most probably moved away from the coasts and into other more roman-y areas.

Most of this is from the book ""de friezen"" by Luit van der Tuuk as well as supporting bits off of wikipedia. ",0,1407583925,null,0,false,0,cjlcice,t3_2d244y,t1_cjlcice,t3_2d244y,null,1435151603,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

For example there is very little Angle os Saxon blood in the English. There was not some big invasion where the local populous were wiped out forced to migrate to Wales.

There were some conflict and a little migration but the vast amount of the Britons stayed and as the Angles and the Saxons that were here became more dominant, the local populous started to adopt their culture and ways.

So in many ways the English are pretty much just as Celtic as the Irish though for the most part neither side like to admit it. Ireland may have not had the Romans or Angles and Saxons come over, but the Norse came to Ireland in a big way.

In truth neither Ireland or the UK are particularly Celtic either, at least not when it comes to bloodlines. The Celts themselves were a people who migrated to both Isles but like future and previous cultures that migrated they did not have a big impact on the bloodlines wither. Though like later with the what would become English adopting Saxon culture, earlier in Ireland and Briton the larger populous adopted the Celtic cultures and changed them.

I highly doubt they would be ok with it if you just show up there and they'd have to fend for another person when they thought your gf was coming over here alone.  
About your visa: As far as I understand it you'll arrive here with just a normal visa which is good for 3 months. If you intend to stay longer than those 3 months(which I guess since your gf will stay for atleast a year I guess) you'll have to go to the ""Einwohnermeldeamt"" (Registration Office) within a week of arrival in germany and apply for that. And if you obtain this I guess you'll have a ""Aufenthaltsgenehmigung"" (residence permit) and you should be able to work here.   
But I'm not 100% certain that's how a work visa works. You should just call the ~~US embassy in germany~~ german consulate in the US and check out how this works out. They should be able to give you all the information you need.  
When it comes to learning german I would just try to talk as much german as possible and not just rely on english the whole time. The more you talk it the more you learn. And if you just tell the german people around you to help you out by politely correcting you if you make a mistake.  
That's what I did in the US and it worked out pretty well. Whenever I came across something I didn't understand I just asked.  
I can't speak for everyone but I wouldn't be offended if you asked me 3 times what I said in german.  
Try even to talk to your gf in german since she'll be learning it quite fast if she's an au pair.  
I live pretty close to cologne actually and when it's time to get here and you might need some help or have any questions feel free to just pm me and I'll try my best to help you out.

(The following is speculation) The only weapon that retailers would have against this would be to understock so that they don't run out of food which they are then forced to supply to foodbanks who can undercut them. Done en masse, this would affect the supply and disctribution chain as orders declined. This would potentially result in food becoming more expensive and leading to less people being able to afford it and thus themselves becoming reliant on foodbanks, causing a feedback loop.

true,trulyElse,beginner-english,beginner (native English),"All right, let's see what I can do:

---

**Nominative**: The subject case.

Think ""I, he, she, it, etc.""

**Accusative**: The direct object case.

Think ""Me, him, her, it, etc.""

**Dative**: The indirect object case.

Think ""To me, for him, from her, etc.""

**Genitive**: The possessive case.

Think ""my / mine, his, her / hers, its, etc.""

---

In German, the cases are marked in all nouns, not just pronouns.

Since nouns also have four cases in German (Masculine, Neuter, Feminine, and Plural), you're going to have to memorise a table of definite articles (""the"" analogues).

Case | Masc | Neuter | Feminine | Plural
----|----|------|--------|------
Nominative | Der | Das | Die | Die
Accusative | Den | Das | Die | Die
Dative | Dem | Dem | Der  | Den
Genitive | Des | Des | Der | Der

With the indefinite articles (""a / an"" analogues), the endings change to match with the definite article.

When the definite article would be ""die"", the indefinite is ""eine"".  
When the definite article would be ""das"", the indefinite is ""ein"".
When it's ""dem"", use ""einem"".  
When it's ""den"", use ""einen"".  
""Des"", ""eines"".  
""Der"", ""einer"".

With the only exception of masculine nominative, which is just ""ein"" for some reason.

It's much more profitable for them to run the risk of throwing away 1 ton of apples than to run the risk of not selling 1 more ton of apples. So the leftover problem will still remain.

That being said, the government itself could buy the leftover food from the supermarkets, thus giving it to the poor. But there are huge economic risks involved in that as well.

Fornborgar were unsophisticated fortifications, usually in stone but with fairly low walls. They were used for defensive purposes so nobody lived there normally.

Ett exempel på en fornborg.

&gt;Predikstolen ligger i den nordöstra delen av Uppsala-Näs socken, i närheten av Gottsunda. Den består av en 4.5 hektar stor ""huvudborg"" och en 1.5 hektar stor ""annexborg"", som ligger på två höjder invid varandra, och är därmed en av Upplands största fornborgar. Själva borgberget är 400 x 250 meter stort och begränsas av svaga branter i väster och nordväst, av något kraftigare branter i norr och nordost samt betydande branter i öster. I söder och sydost finns en markant förkastningsbrant, 2-10 meter höga, med de högsta partierna i sydost. Klippavsatsen i denna del kallas tack vare sitt utseende för ""Predikstolen"". Borgen utgjorde gräns mellan Mälaren i söder och större jordbruksamarker i norr och nordväst och omges av lersprickdalar som avvattnats av Hågaån i nordväst, norr, nordost och öster. Cirka 50 meter söder om bäckravinen finns moränhöjden där ""annexborgen"" är belägen.

&gt;Anläggningen, som är en av de bäst undersökta i landet, antas ha anlagts under mellersta Bronsåldern, cirka 1300 f.Kr, och ligger i ett område rikt på bronsåldersfynd, bl.a. boplatser, depåfynd, hällristningar och en gravhägnad. 3 km norr om borgen ligger Hågahögen och det bronsålderstida kulthus som går under namnet Kung Björns kyrka och arkeologerna antar att de har samband med varandra.

That's quite an early example but not much changed. It's hard to find English sources for specific ""forts"" (can't think of a better word, fornborg translated literally means ""ancient fort"").

Non capire questo, o voler far finta di non capirlo, ovviamente stravolge le conclusioni e i dati statistici.
Accorpare poi sinti e rom è un'altro magheggio per scompaginare in maniera favorevole verso la propria posizione le statistiche.

I rom stanziali, che sono sì la maggior parte ma sono anche i rom secolarizzati, non sono un problema, in larga parte.
Sono qui da ben prima dell'ondata di rom nomadi che, in larga parte, rappresenta il problema.
Accomunarli in un unico gruppo, come detto, falsa le conclusioni, in buona o cattiva fede.

Per lo stesso motivo è sbagliato accomunare rom e sinti.
I secondi si trovano in grandissima percentuale sulla penisola italiana da secoli, sono integrati, in gran maggioranza stanziali, e sostanzialmente ormai indistinguibili dal Brambilla o Esposito di turno.

Ovviamente restringere il campo dell'indagine statistica ai rom nomadi, post ondata dell'apertura delle frontiere UE, stravolgerebbe i risultati, facendo uscire un quadro molto più negativo di quanto sia funzionale all'autrice dell'articolo.

1) If shops are required to donate all their unsold food to foodbanks, then foodbanks will become more commonplace and carry a wider range of higher quality goods.

2) The higher quantity and quality of goods available in wider range of foodbanks will lead a number of people to acquire their food at foodbanks rather than purchasing it at shops; even if they are not ecconomically forced to do so because for many people freeing up an extra £70-80-90 or more a week may not be neccesary, but would help pay for the family to have a nice holiday this year, or could be used to send the kids to an after school club.

3) The knock on effect of this is that less people buy food from shops, resulting in them having to reduce stock, reduce orders, reduce staff and potentially even close down.

For the record, I've worked as a manager is a food retailer, I dont think people on the outside realise just how tight margins are, and how much effort goes in to avoiding waste. I also have a pretty good idea of how people react to insentives; We had quite a hardcore of customers at my shop who were in there often enough to work out how our discounting system worked. Rather than buy a product, they'd wait until the day before its use-by date when we'd reduce it substantially to clear it and buy it then. I even had customers on occasion ask me to put goods aside for them when we marked them down so they could get them at that price. Not everyone in the world is either so poor they can't afford food without foodbanks, or so rich that they need not care about the price of food. Most are in the middle, with enough money to buy the food they need, but on the lookout for ways to get they food they need/want for less, or even for free. 

As it happens, we did have an arrangement with a local soup kitchen for them to get leftover bread and veg at the end of the day; I don't object to shops giving their food to chairty, I think it's great, I just think that if it's compulsory and done an a massive scale, it's going to have all kinds of unforseen and potentially negative consequences for the food retail industry.",1,1407589732,null,0,false,0,cjldors,t3_2d26b0,t1_cjldors,t1_cjldeca,null,1435152052,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

Ich hab lange Zeit genau so wie du gedacht, und auch das Argument ""Israel = demokratischer Staat, Palestinensergebiete = ein unorganisierter Haufen"" ergo ""große Schwester soll vernünftiger sein"" argumentiert.

Ich denke aber, dass das hier zu kurz greift:  
  
1. ist die Hamas momentan im Gazastreifen nicht alleine eine ""Terroristengruppe"" sondern: ""Seit ihrem Wahlsieg 2006 bzw. dem bürgerkriegsartigen Kampf um Gaza im Juni 2007, der international überwiegend als Putsch der Hamas wahrgenommen wurde, stellt die Hamas die Regierung über den Gazastreifen."" Quelle: [Wikipedia](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas)  
  
2. Es deutet alles darauf hin, dass die Hamas ihre Bomben geziehlt aus Gebeiten abfeuert, die Isreal dann bei Gegenschlägen besonders ""kreigsverbrecherisch"" ausschauen lässt - z.B. direkt von einem Block mit vielen [Hotels](http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/08/05/indian-tv-reporter-films-hamas-assembling-launching-missiles-from-residential-area-outside-hotel-minutes-before-cease-fire-video/) oder direkt von [Spitälern und Kirchen](http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/08/07/archbishop-hamas-fired-out-of-our-church-in-gaza-video/) und somit gezielt auch einen ""Propagandakrieg"" führt.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Un bon risotto, les gens sont convaincus que c'est ultra technique donc ça impressionne mais en vrai c'est très facile à faire.

Perso probablement ma recette préférée est poulet / champignons (j'aime les recettes simples) mais sincèrement tu peux mettre ce que tu veux dedans : chorizo en dés + poivrons, trois fromages etc... 

De manière générale pas plus deux deux ou trois ingrédients principaux, ça doit rester simple pour être bon.

**Il faut :**

Du riz spécial : Arborio est bon et bon marché, Carnaroli est un peu plus cher mais rend mieux (donne un rendu plus crêmeux).

Du parmesan (of course), de préférence une pointe de parmesan que tu râpes toi-même pour plus de fraîcheur. Plus il a de mois d'affinage plus il a de goût et donc meilleur sera le rendu final.

Bouillon cube, selon la recette que tu vas faire / ta préférence. Pour mon exemple poulet champignon tu peux prendre du bouillon de volaille mais le bouillon de légumes passe bien également.

Filets de poulet ou de dinde si tu veux faire des économies.

Champignons de paris en barquette (les champignons réduisent énormément à la cuisson donc prends la dose).

Herbes / épices, selon la recette et ta préférence. J'aime beaucoup le romarin, le cumin c'est super aussi, le saffran est un classique parfume et qui donne une couleur jaune au riz mais c'est assez cher.

Une casserole, un wok (ou une poêle à bords hauts) et une louche.

**Pour la recette en elle même.**

Rinces rapidement les champignons (mais pas trop sinon ils risquent d'absorber trop d'eau et de perdre de leur goût). Tu coupes les pieds à la moitié en gros (pour virer la partie sale à la base) puis tu coupes en lamelles. 

Tu coupes le poulet en petits morceaux.

Tu fais frémir une casserole d'eau avec tes bouillons cubes dedans, ce sera ton jus.

Dans la grande poêle tu mets une bonne dose d'huile d'olive ou de beurre et tu mets ton poulet à cuire (il faut qu'il soit cuit à coeur évidemment, le poulet ne doit jamais être rosé) quand il est bien tu rajoutes le riz et tu le fais dorer un peu avec l'huile (2 minutes en gros), puis tu rajoutes les champignons.

Tu laisses les champignons réduire puis tu rajoutes un peu de jus avec ta louche. Le riz ne doit pas baigner dans le jus donc mets en juste assez. 

Tu rajoutes tes herbes, puis tu laisses cuire à feu moyen en rajoutant du jus petit à petit au fur et à mesure que le riz l'absorbe tout en remuant toutes les 30 secondes / 1 minute (très régulièrement disont).

Goûtes de temps à autre. Le riz est cuit quand il est un peu ""crémeux"" mais toujours un tout petit ferme au centre. 

Rajoutes le parmesan que tu as râpé avec amour, mélange un peu. Goûtes. Si ça manque de sel rajoutes en un peu puis ajoutes le poivre et les épices.

Ne rajoutes pas de sel avant la fin, car le bouillon cube et le parmesan vont saler ta préparation donc si tu rajoutes du sel avant la fin tu risques de te retrouver avec un risotto ultra salé. N'en rajoute donc que si tu considères ton risotto comme insuffisamment salé **après le jus et le parmesan**.

Et voilà. 

Ça prend en général autour de 30 min pour le total et c'est un peu contraignant car tu dois rester à côté pour surveiller et remuer mais globalement c'est très simple à faire et c'est toujours délicieux.

true,TheDeafWhisperer,null,null,"I took the diagnostic test. It's hard for several reasons, Quebecois French being only one of them (and only significant in the vocabulary section). 

What your GF can do in the two weeks before the exam: 

- Think ahead and talk to someone in the department/school she's applying to (not at admission). She definitely shouldn't blame the differences between dialects, as they are mostly irrelevant here, and saying that she hasn't learned them grammer words the way they're used in the test is not going to get her out of the requirement. But she may be able to know how strict they are on the test results, have an opportunity to show that she's concerned about the test getting in the way of her degree in spite of her linguistic mastery. (Complaining not advised - it's really about taking the opportunity to make herself known as a human being and a (future) professional.)

- Read the grammar pages offered on the page you link to. There are many ways to describe grammatical things, and she may not have learned the exact terms used in the test (and/or she may have learned them some time ago). The first part of the diagnostic test is pretty heavy on description - it's fairly easy when you have the right tools, but if you don't it's impossible. If she learns the vocab they use, she'll do alright. So it's all going to be about notes and flashcards. 

- Spend some time going over the tougher parts of French grammar - agreements, plurals, irregular verbs. There are [quite a few books](http://www.lerobert.com/dictionnaires-thematiques/synonymes-orthographe-/dictionnaire-dorthographe-et-de-difficultes-du-francais.html) dedicated only to the [difficulties of the French language](http://superieur.deboeck.com/titres/127398_3/dictionnaire-des-difficultes-du-francais.html), she should get familiar with one of those soon. Proofreading and editing manuals are also very helpful, because they tend to focus on all the little things you need to know when checking for mistakes that writers always overlook. 

- Do the vocab part of the test over and over again. I don't know how many different sets of questions they offer online, but apparently it's more than 4. The only forms that for me were a problem I could pin on Quebecois were the few phrases that I couldn't identify as contemporary France French, but may or may not be more common in Quebec. Knowing that the test was Quebecois apparently tricked me into thinking some forms should be considered correct, and I sort of panicked a couple times. 

- Work on it six days a week, for a minimum of 45 minutes a day. 

Think of it as preparing the verbal section of the GRE - you wouldn't go unprepared just because it's all going to be questions on your own language. 

I did my undergrad and part of my grad studies in France, with an MA in French grammar and stylisitcs; I taught college French for most of the past decade and I've translated books on linguistics. It's my area of nerdiness. The test from CCDMD sugested I take classes in vocab and verb forms (it hurt me a little. But they're probably right).

This is extremely simplistic in so many points.

Producing food, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian consumes huge amounts of ressources and produces huge amounts of waste. Growing crops and animals is one of, if not the single most water-consuming process we have established on this planet.

Moreso, transport of the crops and animals from the point of origin, through the various processes of the food industry to the wrapping and storing it in supermarket shelves, the whole process itself (medication, fertilizer, animal waste, processing from the crop to supermarket cake you have in the shelf) and so on produces insane amounts of waste and pollution. Like: Non-imaginable amounts.

Even if you disagree on principle with giving away stuff for free (and there are reasonable arguments to be made for that, even if I don't agree with many of them), you cannot on the one hand argue against waste of oil and plastics and on the other hand be fine with the waste of all the food the industry produces just to throw it away.

[This]( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2cew3g/what_happened_in_your_country_before_current/cjf77k9) was my attempt from last week’s thread. 


In the middle of the 1st century AD, all of what is today Bulgarian lands became a part of the Roman Empire. 


* 45 – 48 AD: [legio VIII Augusta]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legio_VIII_Augusta) founded the ancient village of [Novae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novae). The pictures in the wiki page are great. Here’s a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Ow2wF_APl60#t=40).


* 78 AD: Emperor Vespasian established the ancient city of [Abritus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abritus) as a military camp. [picture 1](http://bulgariatravel.org/data/media/115_001_Arheologichen_rezervat_Abritus.jpg), [picture 2](http://bulgariatravel.org/data/media/115_005_Arheologichen_rezervat_Abritus.jpg), [picture 3](http://www.chudesa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%811.jpg).


* 98 AD: the [Ancient Roman Theater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plovdiv_Roman_theatre) was constructed and built in [Plovdiv]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plovdiv) (Romans called the city *Trimontium*). [picture 1](http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/8876854.jpg), [picture 2](http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/882bcd22-a403-4da6-a47f-43703ae78d0e.img)


* 101 – 106 AD: the ancient city of [Nicopolis ad Istrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicopolis_ad_Istrum) was founded.

* 105 – 106 AD: the ancient city of [Nicopolis ad Nestum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicopolis_ad_Nestum) was built in honor of Emperor Trajan’s victory over the Dacians. [picture 1](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Nicopolis_ad_Nestum_Iz2.jpg), [picture 2](http://www.garmen.bg/new/images/stories/Zabelejitelnosti/Nikopolis/8.jpg)


* 106 AD: the second fortified town of [Ulpia Escus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oescus) was built in honor of Emperor Trajan’s victory over the Dacians.

* 106 – 107 AD: the city-state [Augusta Traiana](http://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BC_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%90%D0%B2%D0%B3%D1%83%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0_%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%B0) (in Bulgarian, sorry) was founded. It was named “the most flamboyant city of the Traians”.

* 117-138 AD: the [Roman Stadium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plovdiv_Roman_Stadium) was built during Emperor Hadrian’s reign. [picture](http://cl.jroo.me/z3/4/L/a/e/a.baa-roman-stadium-in-plovdiv.png), [macket of the stadium](http://cdn2.vtourist.com/4/6385189-small_macket_of_the_stadium_Plovdiv.jpg?version=2)


* in 192 AD: the Roman imperial archives were destroyed by fire, so not much is known from there.


* In the early 3rd century AD: Gothic tribes raided the [Montana]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana,_Bulgaria) fortress. [picture 1]( http://bulgariatravel.org/data/media/179_001_Antichna_krepost_Montana.jpg), [picture 2]( http://bulgariatravel.org/data/media/179_003_Antichna_krepost_Montana.jpg), [picture 3]( http://www.ranica.eu/img/933c4bee3a.jpg)


* 245 – 300 AD, [Ulpia Serdica]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Sofia#Antiquity) had become a major regional imperial capital, where Emperor Diocletian and subsequent emperors held court.



I would add that [some claim](http://www.bulgaria-embassy.org/history_of_bulgaria.htm#THE%20BULGARIANS) that some Bulgarian tribes came down to the European continent for the first time in the 2nd century AD.

&gt;The clear signs of Germanic influx all over Britain is now widely accepted and has been shown in other studies such as Capelli et al. (2003). The Capelli study made two important observations: the English, Frisian, and Dutch samples were indistinguishable from each other - and North German/Danish genetic frequences were indistinguishable, thus precluding any ability to distinguish between the genetic influence of the Anglo-Saxon source populations and the later, and better documented, influx of Danish Vikings.

true,hobbyanimal,null,null,"&gt; You're making the rather gross assumptions that this will not reduce food waste

I don't see how it would, as I said, retailers don't aim to have waste. They do aim to have sufficient stocks to meet demand and that will usually mean having something left over at the end since selling out means lost sales and you can never predict exactly how much of a product you are going to sell on a given day. A degree of waste is inevitable no matter what you do and the cumpolsary 'donation' of leftovers to foodbanks won't stop retailers trying to order the correct amount of a product to meet expected demand.

&gt; that charities will be donating in the same locality as the donation,

There can't be many places in France or any other developed country where there is a demand for food that doesn't have a nearby food retailer. It doesn't matter which retailer a foodbank gets its food from the effect on nearby buisnesses will be the same, and if nationwide all shops are forced to 'donate' (although that's a poor term for a compulsory handing over of property) then the affect on the food retailers will be the same irrespective of where the foodbanks operate or aquire their goods.

&gt; that foodbanks are available to all regardless of need

So before you can go into a foodbank you have to meet certain criteria. OK, what would those be? Assume, for the sake of argument, that you only allow homeless people in. Set aside for one moment that determining whether someone has a fixed address is not the easiest thing to do and would require a well-funded beurocracy of investigators checking that people aren't abusing the system, what happens when all the homeless people have taken the food they want from the food bank? Remember, the point here is to end food waste, not neccesarily help the poor. Who do you let in next? Unemployed people? Low income families? Fair enough, so you'll need to expand that team of investiagtors to make all the neccesary checks and issue people with licenses or something to use foodbanks.

After letting all those people have their fill, because of the compulsory donations from shops, you still have a surpluss of food to get rid of. Does that then become waste and you throw it away? Or do you expand further the criteria for allowing people to use foodbanks? What if, as a result of your expansion, shops start going out of buisness and the quantity of 'donations' decreases, do you then have to start rationing, or ban some people altogether? 

Centralised planning of food distribution - with the aim of avaoiding waste and ensuring everyone's need is fullfilled - has been tried several times, and has been shown to fail several times.  

&gt; It is ridiculous to state, with absolute conviction, what will happen if this went through, and that it would be more negative than positive.

I don't state with absolute conviction; I don't for certain know what will happen. I am, as I said earlier, speculating based in part on my experiences as someone who has worked in the food retail industry, my experience and understanding of how people follow incentives, and my observations of what happens when the state gets involved with management and distribution of provisions.

I could well be proved wrong, it may be that food banks can take all the food that shops throw away, distribute amongs the genuinly needy without the system being abused and for that to have no effect on the food retail industry. I'd like to be wrong and I'm open to being proven wrong, but I don't think I will.",0,1407594361,null,0,false,0,cjleyjx,t3_2d26b0,t1_cjleyjx,t1_cjle4qb,null,1435152703,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

When you get there, find a nice pub to hang out and drink Kölsch (keep in mind, they keep replacing the empty *stangs* until you say ""nein"").  You will find many Germans who will speak ""a little bit"" of Englisch, which would make them, by our standards, fluent.  You will also find many that don't.  It is also often difficult to get Germans to speak German, they'll want to practice their Englisch with you.  I can't imagine navigating the German bureaucracy for a work permit, given that.  Let alone the fact you will have a tourist visa (90 days?) at which point you will have to leave.  One of my last flights back to the US, I sat next to a very attractive young woman who was very sad as her visa had expired and she had to leave her bf and return to Boston to some unhappy circumstance there.

I doubt you will be able to find anything affordable by way of an apartment, and you won't be able to get an apartment unless you can prove an ability to pay the rent.  Maybe you can find a room-mate or flat sharing arrangement.  Housing in Köln I would expect to be quite expensive.

All that said, your best shot would be to find a US company that has a presence in Köln where you would get paid in US dollars from a US bank, pay US taxes (Foreign Earned Income Exclusion!!).  This would also get around the working papers thing.  US Military installations are a good bet (go to USA Jobs.com) although I don't think there is much of that in Köln.  Another possibly would be to find an English speaking college program, like [Rhein-Waal](http://www.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/en/) and get a student visa.  I would not try to work ""under the table"" in Germany-  I think you'd find they were very strict about foreigners working there without permits, and if you were caught, you'd find yourself in some serious hot-water.

true,hobbyanimal,null,null,"&gt; By your own arguments this would reduce food waste through waste now being a competitive disincentive.

Food waste is already a competative disicentive; but in practical terms, waste is inevitable. Say a shop sells on average 90 liters of milk a day. Their supplier ships in units of 20. How much should the shop order? if they order 100, not only do they meet avergae demand, they have surplus in case of extra demand. If they order 80, they fail to meet demand and along with lost sales, gain a reputation for being understocked, thus incentivising customers to go to competitors who are know fpr always having sufficient milk to meet demand.

Now, let's say that as a result of food waste being redistributed through foodbanks, the shop only sells 50 litres a day. They still have to order 60 to cover their demand, so the wasteage is the same - 10 liters. However, the buisness is making less money, the supplier is making less money and the producer is making less money. All 3 have to lay off staff as they can no longer afford to employ them and those unemployed people now themselves become dependant on food banks. 

No shop can order exactly the amount they need to meet demand and it''s unrealistic to expect them to and the net result of this policy is that food production no longer responds to demand.

&gt; I am not sure if the infrastructure exists, and I would surprised if it did, but there are numerous needy throughout Europe, Northern Africa, and the Near East who would benefit from food not being wasted.

Well you've sort of answered your own question there. Yes, the problem is infrastructure; that's where the investment needs to be. But between the options of investing in a means to produce and distribute their own fresh food, or making them dependant upon an infrastructural system designed to ship waste food from the west, which option would you go for? I'd suggest the former.

What has allowed the development in the west of infrasturtcure to produce and distribute cheap food is having a free market with little government inteference, in which individuals and companies are free to develop new and more efficient techniques for producing, storing, distributing and selling food. The best thing we can do top help the poor is to get investment in infrastructure, rather than encouraging them to be reliant on waste and the best way to do that is to get the state out of the way and allow the market to develop solutions to these problems.

Developing countries have a great advantage here, they can copy what has worked in the west without having to go through the same costly trial-and-error prcoess. This is why countries like China and India have avanced so quickly, becuase thy have been able to invest directly into infastructure, rather than in R&amp;D.

Where there is food poverty, pure resource poverty is rarely the issue, there is often a political aspect to it as well.

&gt; The bureaucracy is the same required to prove eligibility for any benefits, and thus already exists.

Except that you're distributing food, not money. Because you have a finitie amount depending on how many 'donations' are received, you will need to have a different system for organising and distibuting as to what you do with benefits.

&gt; You sounded very convinced in your initial volley.

Then dissuade me. I've said I'm open to the possibility that this would work; moreover I'd like to see it work I'm not more a fan of poverty or food waste than you are.

Once upon a time, there were bad, bad crop failures. People were hungry to starving, and turned to poaching, and the lords weren't even doing anything against it as dead plebs aren't fun, either, you need your workforce. Not much later, the forests were nearly empty of game... and now the wolves began to starve.

Wolves don't usually attack humans, much less settlements because if nothing else, it's just too dangerous because humans are nasty, nasty fucks indeed. Wolves only do such things when the choice is ""starve, or try your luck"".

Humans, however, talk about terror and seek security, and the speciescide lasted a hell a lot of centuries.

Btw: If you ever meet a wolf in the wild (probably in quite some distance), don't turn your back, the fuck don't run (that not only marks you as prey, the second you turn to run is the second wolves start to charge, instinctively, no matter if you're a rabbit or Tyrannosaurus Rex), be non-aggressive but act as *if* you have a weapon. As said, wolves can tell easy from risky prey, and chances are they'd rather search a bit more for a deer or such than risk a scary two-legged thing that fights with sticks and metal. Withdraw orderly, again, neither running not turning your back and looking like you could kill that wolf, if you only cared to.

Watched bits and pieces of the movie, enjoyed music backgrounds of Evil Imperialist Russia and a nice and light tune of poor little Tbilisi + other minor things like comparison between living conditions of Russian Army vs Georgian (it was no secret that Russian side was poor equipped and looked hideous, hence rearmament campaign and so on i guess), Boris Nemtsov in every single anti-regime video it seems etc. Overall, 8/10 propaganda video. 


Strangely enough mr.Saakashvilli is still alive and kicking (not even in jail, although Georgians themselves issued an arrest order recently i think? State department was ""concerned"" about its little pet project and voiced its solicitude, was kind a amusing to see) and Georgia is not occupied by Russian forces for 10 years.

 Neither Abkhazia nor South Ossetia is annexed into Russian Federation either, weird, huh?But anyway back to more interesting topic.


I am genuinely interested by which criteria redditors here engage in witch hunts? Like, what exactly indicates a Russian paid shill and why do you think so?


I thought about this for a bit and this makes no sense to me at all, this is a relatively small sub with ~70k subs and about 300-500 people online every moment or so, unless there is some kind of interesting development or event like Eurovision/WC.


What makes you people think that Russia is actively engaged here? A lot of Anti-Russian news are heavily upvoted and usually at the top of the front page here, anti russian comments have more positive score than pro russian ones, the quality of news are right there with Sun/Daily Mail, Fox News etc. Whats the deal?


Here is how you could really shill and sway public opinions (my thoughts):

1) Register a number of alt accounts preferably via proxies, Tors and other shit, so that your IPs would show different places of the world, thus negating the possible investigation of mods (i dunno if they see IPs and shit, so i included them as well) /Admins. 

The reason this is effective should be obvious, first several upvotes matter a whole lot more on Reddit than the next 30 and so on. There were numerous scandals on r/Dota2, Unidan guy, Chanman etc, there is plenty of good evidence why people do it and what power it gives to them.

2)When you have these alts you can either heavily downvote anti-Russian sentiment or upvote pro Russian ones, pretty straightforward i think.

3) If possible, comment via these alts as well, preferably using **non-russian** flair. The reason i think this is somewhat important is whenever i see German, French/UK flair i subconsciously give them more ""power"" so to speak, as to having more balanced view or whatever. I *expect* russia bashing from Ukrainians and Eastern Europeans/Baltics more, thus the weight this messages carry degrades over time. 

This is somewhat of a /pol stuff, when people on imgboards made fun of poles and their martyr syndrom, similar to how a lot of Eastern Europeans hated Russia even before Ukraine ordeal. 

You can also use this alt accounts to troll, neglect, make fun of someone with valid points, basically NSA/GCHQ playbook of killing internet discussions from time to time.

4) Give occasional gold or two with similar reasoning of non-Russian flair, gold=someone thought this is interesting, important -&gt; i should probably check it out.

5)Voting rings/downvote brigades should be used from time to time as well.


There is probably more aspects to that, these are the first that come to mind. From what i've seen here, if anything, this is exactly the opposite of a place, where Russian shills are engaged.

true,hobbyanimal,null,null,"&gt; There isn't currently an incentive against food waste.

What??? So when a shop buys food that they don't sell and throw it away there's no incentive for them to not do that? Have you ever worked in food retail?

&gt; It is more profitable to waste food than to not-waste food, as you know - you made that point yourself.

What? how did you get that from what I said? What I said was that the most profitable thing for a shop to do is to have slightly more stock that required to meet average demand. That's NOT the same as saying it's profitable to waste food. If it was profitable to waste food, shops would order 100x what they needed and chuck 99% of it away.

The point is, there is absolutely no way you can practically make food production, distribution and selling completely waste-free.

&gt; Therefore we introduce an economic disincentive/reverse incentive that will penalise wasting food.

As I illustrated earlier, this added incentive won't actually make shops waste less than they already do. How would it? And why, for the sake of 'penalising' retailers do you understand how incentives work, but for the sake of people doing their food shopping, or shops ordering to fulfil demand, you don't? No shop orders more than it thinks it can sell, rounded up to the nearest unit the supplier deals in. No amount of extra incentives will change that. You want to force shops to give away their excess for free and allow others to distribute it. Yet you don't see how that may create incentives for people to use the free source of food over they one they have to pay for?

&gt; This will reduce food waste, if your scenario of poor multinational retailers struggling to scrape a profit comes to light.

What are you on about? do you knoiw how competative the food industry is? Any company that is profitable, be it a local producer or a multinational distributor, puts huge amounts of its profit back into the company, investing in new technologies and new infrastructure to stay ahead of the competition.

I will admit that i used somewhat of a hyperbole and a cheap shot at United States, but the main point remains the same, after 2008 war Georgia remained a sovereign state, its borders were practically (there are reports about Russian fences here and there, but nothing outrageous) untouched, its president at the time is still not in gulag, Newly elected Georgia PM/president is pretty European oriented and Russia does jack shit about it, European investigation committee has found that Georgia started the conflict (read wiki if you don't believe me) there are no ongoing civil war there, nor every day car bombings and stuff. In my playbook, this is *not that bad* of an outcome for a **conflict** between two states. Russia didn't bombed Georgia into the stone age and people seem to be living *ok'ish* there?

&gt;«Il sindaco Variati non può obbligare nessuno a lavorare, tantomeno un nomade». Davide Casadio, presidente dell’associazione Sinti Italiani in viaggio per il diritto e la cultura, non accetta che il primo cittadino di Vicenza (Pd), dopo la decisione del Comune di pagare 59 mila euro per saldare le bollette arretrate di luce e gas di due campi rom, abbia chiesto in cambio ai loro abitanti di svolgere qualche attività socialmente utile, come la pulizia delle strade o lo sfalcio dell’erba. 

Da quanto in quà c'è l'allaccio della luce e del gas in un campo nomadi? Ma vabbè.
In ogni caso, chi fa un lavoro dev'essere pagato. Deve essere sotto regolare contratto etc. I romanì verrebbero assunti dal comune per fare quei lavori? O in che modo dovrebbero espletarli esattamente?

You really don't know what you are on about. Weapons from the fsa ending up in the hands of Jihadists is the biggest issue with helping the rebels. Even when the US vetted rebels in Daraa province and gave them Croatian weapons... it still ended up in the hands of Jihadists. Unlike Libyan weapons, Croatian weapons are personally controlled by the Americans. Only rebels that are acceptable to America get these weapons. Yet it keeps appearing in the hands of jihadists. That is why Obama has been dragging his feet.

What's the matter yankee, too many multisyllabic words for you? Do you want me to explain what multisyllabic means?

No, but seriously. Please don't take the cheeseburger out of your mouth long enough to get out of your rascal scooter, I'm so scared!

Just for the record let's settle a few things I believe: 

1) America is indeed the greatest country in the world (albeit it's not perfect, because that's a ridiculous standard to hold a country to) 

2) The Russian government is full of crooks and liars to an extent that is unimaginable to many in the west 

3) The Russian government has not historically and does not today care about the value of human life, at all

4) The best possible future for Russia, in my opinion, is to be the very sort of American satellite that European countries were/are and that's why Putin is portraying it as the scary option, to rule it out of the realm of feasible discussion. Hopefully this outcome would lead to the development of the social democratic values that Russia as a civilization clearly requires for future prosperity

5) Russian values are immensely corrupt as of now, they are values of medieval despotism combined with the even harsher ones of totalitarian communism, as well as the spirit of ethnocultural chauvinism that has always characterized Russians

6) If this situation keeps developing in the way I (and many others) foresee, Russia cannot possibly hope to be on the winning side in the long run, and maybe even in the short run

7) Putin is riding a wave of nationalism which he did not fully create and which can turn on him at a moment's notice

8) The current Russian government has stolen or squandered &gt;90% of Russia's wealth over the past 15 years, forever robbing the country of a chance to quickly modernize as it should have

And yet, none of those points in any way go against my strongly held beliefs that the US is both instigating the conflict with Russia by pushing east (although I don't blame them, as Zbig wrote, it's in America's interests and I can hardly fault a country for following its interests)  and that the ultimate holders of authority over a given area are its people.

I wanted to see whether you in any way support (even in theory) the democratic principle of letting a people decide who they're governed by. Unfortunately you're so brainwashed by your own side's propaganda that all you can think is ""RUUSSIAAAA BAAADDD!!! MUST SMASH!!!"", which is fine. The world needs simpletons like yourself in the rich tapestry of society.

I will admit, I've lost this argument.

- Couper 4-5-6 belles tomates bien mûres (bien goûteuses ça fait beaucoup pour la recette) en dés,
- couper une grosse mozarella en dés aussi,
- laver et détacher des feuilles de basilic frais entières,
- bien mélanger le tout dans un grand saladier avec la dose d'huile d'olive, sel et poivre,
- laisser reposer une heure en brassant un peu régulièrement, le but c'est de faire un bon jus et d'imprégner le mélange avec le parfum du basilic (au début au frigo mais le sortir avant pour que ce ne soit pas trop froid),
- faire cuire des pennes al dente comme c'est indiqué sur la boîte,
- égoutter les pennes et mélanger avec les tomates-mozza-basilic,
- servir de suite.

true,balanceofpain,null,null,"Wow, ich habe selten einen dermaßen bescheuerten Beitrag gelesen.
Gehen wir's im einzelnen durch:

&gt; Allerdings muss man nunmal auch den Unterschied zwischen der Hamas,
&gt; einer Terrorgruppe, und Israel, einem demokratischen Staat,
&gt; sehen. Israel kann und darf sich nicht an den Standards der Hamas
&gt; messen, was sie aber offenbar zumindest teilweise tun. Das ist das
&gt; große Problem hier, nicht dass das große böse Israel die arme,
&gt; kleine Hamas mobbt.

Was für Standards sollen das denn sein?  Und wo genau bemisst sich
denn Israel an denen der Hamas?  In einem bewaffneten Konflikt, und
darum geht es hier ja wohl, gelten die Regeln des humanitären
Völkerrechts.  Die Hamas und ihre Klone verletzen es vorsätzlich,
methodisch und ohne Unterlass: sie tragen keine Uniformen; sie
unterscheiden nicht zwischen Zivilisten und Kombattanten; ihre
Angriffe sind selten militärisch notwendig; ihre Strategie basiert auf
der Provokation ziviler Todesopfer im Zuge der Vergeltungsschläge
durch den Gegner.  Die IDF hingegen versucht, sich so gut ans
humanitäre Völkerrecht zu halten, wie es geht: Sie kündigen Beschuss
per Warnanruf oder -schuss an, um Zivilisten die Möglichkeit zur
Flucht zu geben.  Statt billiger Flächenbombardements benutzen sie
Präzisionswaffen mit engem Wirkungskreis.  Sie schützen ihre
Zivilisten durch vielerlei Maßnahmen (Bunker, Warnsystem, Iron Dome).
Sie töten ihre Gefangenen nicht.

Der Gehorsam gegenüber dem humanitären Völkerrecht in einem Kampf
gegen einen Gegner, der dieses methodisch verletzt, hat sich in den
letzten zwanzig Jahren als signifikanter militärischer Nachteil
erwiesen, und das Völkerrecht wird hier früher oder später Anpassungen
erleben *müssen*.  Wer dies außer Acht lassend Israel kritisiert,
disqualifiziert sich intellektuell und moralisch und macht seine
Meinung indiskutabel.

&gt; Die palästinensische Zivilbevölkerung hat mit den Aktionen der Hamas
&gt; genausoviel zu tun wie die israelische Zivilbevölkerung mit den
&gt; Aktionen ihrer Regierung.

Welch zweideutige Formulierung!  Inwieweit hat Deiner Meinung nach
denn die Zivilbevölkerung mit den Aktionen ihrer De-facto-Regierung zu
tun?  Entweder voll oder gar nicht.  Dieses Argument kommt vornehmlich
von Leuten, die in Staatsbürgerkunden bzw. im Politikunterricht
geschlafen haben, oder Leuten, die die Schuld für den Zweiten
Weltkrieg und die Shoah den Nazis zuschieben und die deutsche
Zivilbevölkerung davon freisprechen wollen.  Eine Regierung bezieht
ihre Legitimation stets durch das Volk, sei es dadurch, dass dieses
jene wählt (Israel), sei es dadurch dass dieses jene toleriert (Gaza).
Unabhängig vom Legitimationstyp haftet jede Zivilbevölkerung stets für
die Taten ihrer Regierung.  Deswegen ist es ja so wichtig, darauf
hinzuwirken, dass die Regierung eine unterstützenswerte ist.  Die
Palästinenser halten es offenkundig nicht für nötig, die Hamas und all
die anderen Terrororganisationen zu stürzen, um im Anschluss den am
wenigsten inakzeptablen Frieden zu schließen.  Warum nicht?  Solange
sie dies nicht tun, haben sie nicht das Recht, sich darüber zu
beschweren, wenn sie bei Vergeltungsangriffen der Israelis Verwandte
oder das eigene Leben verlieren.

&gt; Und trotzdem sind die Taktiken der Israelis prinzipiell genau die
&gt; gleichen wie die der Hamas.

Ohne Worte.  Wie muss man eigentlich drauf sein, um einen solchen Satz
zu schreiben.

&gt; Großflächiger Beschuss, der nicht nur militärische Ziele trift,
&gt; sondern Wohnhäuser, Schulen und Krankenhäuser ebenso.

Dass palästinensische Kämpfer vornehmlich aus der Nähe von
Wohnhäusern, Schulen und Krankenhäusern zu wirken pflegen, was es
äußerst schwierig und bisweilen schier unmöglich macht, Zivilisten zu
schonen, ist bei Dir offensichtlich noch immer nicht angekommen.

&gt; Dazu dann noch immer wieder die Berichte von erschossenen
&gt; palästinensischen Zivilisten und auch Kindern im Verlauf der
&gt; Bodenoffensive.

Jaja, die Berichte.  Diese objektiven, stets zu treffen, von keinerlei
Hamas-Zensur beeinträchtigten Berichte.  Als unkritischer Deutscher
hinterfragt man solche Berichte natürlich nicht, und fragt entsprechen
auch nie nach den Zusammenhängen, unter denen Zivilisten gleich
welchen Alters getötet werden.

&gt; Israel verhält sich genau wie die Hamas es tut: Keinerlei Achtung
&gt; für die Zivilbevölkerung, größtmögliche Schäden verursachen.

Bist Du wirklich so dumm, oder tust Du nur so?  Wenn Israel keinerlei
Achtung vor der Zivilbevölkerung des Feindes hätte und größtmögliche
Schäden verursachen wollte, dann wäre Gaza schon lange ein
menschenleerer Friedhof.  Die Motivation hinter solchen Äußerungen
muss man wohl im Wunsch der Relativierung der deutschen Schuld sehen.
Es tut einfach gut, IDF-Soldaten mit deutschen Landsern auf dieselbe
Stufe zu stellen.

&gt; Das ist es, was Israel in meinen Augen sehr fragwürdig macht.  Ein
&gt; demokratischer Staat, von Amerika und Europa unterstützt, tut
&gt; dasselbe wie die Terrorgruppe, die sie bekämpfen wollen. Das kann
&gt; einfach nicht in Ordnung sein.

Es darf bezweifelt werden, dass Du Augen hast.

&gt; Die israelische Regierung verhält sich wie ein dummes kleines Kind,
&gt; der als Argument, warum er den 2 Jahre jüngeren Bruder
&gt; zusammengeschlagen hat, vorbringt: ""Aber er hat angefangen und mich
&gt; geärgert.""

Boing!  Da ist es, das Beweisstück A, welches zeigt, dass Du diesen
Konflikt lediglich als einen mikroskopisch zwischenmenschlichen
denkst.  Da kann man von Dir natürlich nicht verlangen, Dinge wie
Einsatzregeln und Völkerrecht im Hinterkopf zu behalten.  Für Dich ist
die Welt ein Kindergarten.  Daraus ergibt sich, dass Dein Urteil
nichts wert ist.

&gt; Ich sage nicht, dass Israel sich nicht wehren darf - aber Israel hat
&gt; sehr wohl andere Mittel um der Hamas zuzusetzen als Luftangriffe und
&gt; großangelegte Bodenoffensiven.

So, jetzt will ich aber sehen.  Welche anderen Mittel hätte Israel
denn, um der Hamas zuzusetzen, und worin läge ihre Wirksamkeit?  Da
bin ich aber mal gespannt, wie Du Dich da herauswieseln willst.

There is a Konjunktiv II as well, which is more commonly used and describes something that hasn't happened and won't happen: ""Wenn Du früh genug aufgestanden *wärst*, hättest Du deinen Termin nicht verpasst.""  (had you gotten up early enough, you wouldn't have missed your appointment)

I actually had to look this up on the german wikipedia article myself, so I hope this helps. Konjunktiv I is not commonly used in spoken language I would say, it would sound a little weird if you actually talked like that. It is used in formal language though.

Konjunktiv II is more commonly used in everyday language.

---

&gt;The __subjunctive__ is a [grammatical mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood) found in many languages. Subjunctive forms of [verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb) are typically used to express various states of unreality such as wish, emotion, possibility, judgment, opinion, necessity, or action that has not yet occurred – the precise situations in which they are used vary from language to language. The subjunctive is an [irrealis mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrealis_mood) (one that does not refer directly to what is necessarily real) – it is often contrasted with the [indicative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicative), which is a realis mood.

Good start :).

&gt; I'm not sure how this is relevant 

Given what you're about to say, I think you do understand how this is relvent.

&gt;since we're talking about private property.

See, you do understand what I was refering to.

&gt;(despite someone else's 100% thought-free comment elsewhere in this thread) 

Cool! I didn't know a machine existed that could tell me in percentage terms how much thought someone had put in to there comment. Can you link me too it?

which is a wholly inappropriate rubric for understanding a person's right to control of hir body.

Property (from dictionary.com):
1.
that which a person owns; the possession or possessions of a particular owner.
2.
goods, land, etc., considered as possessions.
3.
a piece of land or real estate: property on Main Street.
4.
ownership; right of possession, enjoyment, or disposal of anything, especially of something tangible.
5.
something at the disposal of a person, a group of persons, or the community or public: The secret of the invention became common property. 

So lets see, Is my body my possesion? yep! Am I responsible for it's maintanance. Again, yep! Is it something I have the right to enjoy. Yep!Is it something that is at my disposal? yep. 

My body in several ways fits the definition of property; it should be mine to do with as I please without outside coercion, provided I do no harm to others in the process. 

Why do you find it so 'wholly innapropriate' for me to consider my body to be my private property? If my body is not my property, then whose is it? Who gets to say what should or shouldn't be done with my body? who get's to decide how much of my body and mind are made public?

&gt; Since private property and the right to control one's body are completely different concepts that, at most, might appear to share some superficial similarities if you're not inclined to think about things a whole lot, abolishing the one has no bearing on the other.

Except that it doesn't. If you abolish private property, you abolish the concept of a persons body being their property to do with as they choose. If an individual no longer has the rights of ownership over their own body thus neccesarily becomes public property. Almost all personal ncrimes we have; murder, rape, assault etc. are founded upon the idea that the individual is the ownder of their body and thus an attack upon their person is an attack upon their property. If your body is not your property, you have no recourse to complain if someone rapes you, because they are making use of property that as much theirs as it is yours.

If you abolish private property, you abolish the idea than an individual has the right to private use of their own body. Is it your contention that people should not be free to do with their own bodies what they choose provided they do not harm others? If it is, you and I have nothing further to discuss. If it isn't then at some level you accept that private property offers the individual a degree of freedom and protection and is inherently a bad concept.

&gt; I mean, I know you think you've found some sort of ""gotcha!"" trump card here, 

I love that you know what I'm thinking, really reassures me that you respect other people's rights to self-determination.

&gt; but you haven't--if you honestly think that a person's right to hir own body is an instance of private property, then you've merely revealed the sheer vacuousness of your own thinking.

And by throwing insults and using a condescending tone you've shown that your actually quite insecure in your own position. If you had sound arguments as to why there was a fundamental difference between private property and personal bodily rights, you wouldn't have to be so aggresive. Can you calmly explain why abolishing propoerty rights wouldn't damage ones right to freely make use of ones own body and how the individual could maintain privacy of body and mind.

Every represive regime the earth has ever seen has made stripping people of their personal property and their personal rights it's number one priority. If people's bodies are not their own property, they generally end up being the property of the powerful. i.e. the state

As an aside, is 'hir' a contraction of 'his' and 'her'? I quite like it, might start using it myself.

They just suddenly started hate each other out of the blue and ethnically cleanse their enemies!


I wonder if Russians from former Soviet Republics are considered ethnically cleansed, because judging by the numbers of before Soviet Union collapse and after, number of Russians significantly drop in these respected republics (stans, Chechnya, Dagestan and others). I wonder why was that and why Russian families had to leave in such a hurry leaving behind their homes, property or selling them for cents?


Edit to your edit, i think Russia started to care when 10k ""brave freedom fighters with a taste for beheading"" strolled into Dagestan. Chechnya was a definition of a failed state by any means, hell, they still probably are, but at least they are kept quiet under Kadyrov warlord persona. I think its better than blowing up schools, capturing musical theaters, bombing metro's and train stations, bus routes and all the other wonderful things that these people were engaged in.


 I personally would vote with 2 hands and a leg to let Chechnya go if they so wish so, but please don't come to Russia with your organized crime groups, human trafficking, violent, barbaric behavior and culture. 

We have plenty of ""oppressed"" minorities from Central Asia whom when they liberated themselves from evil Russians strangely ended up being Mexicans of Russia. As it turned out, when Russians left, they didn't exactly immediately turned into Saudi Arabia or Kuweit and shit went downhill. Nowadays they fix our bathrooms or sell fruits.

Je te rappelle que tu t'es planté en essayant de me contredire parce que tu n'a fait que lire leurs conclusions.

&gt;Il y a une grande incohérence à dire que tu n'as rien à foutre des enjeux qui touchent les femmes

J'ai jamais dis ça de ma vie. 



---

Bon, j'ai fait quelques recherches. Alors apparemment, en France, ""faire pénétrer"" ne compte pas comme un viol légalement. Le viol requiert, encore une fois, la pénétration. 

http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=0B375139B925EAE1D86AE595400429F4.tpdjo12v_3?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006181753&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;dateTexte=20140809

""Faire pénétrer"" probablement compte comme une ""autre aggression sexuelle""(délit), qui n'est punie que de 5 ans au lieu de 15 pour le viol(crime). Une fois de plus, les femmes sont nettement plus protégées que les hommes. Elles naissent avec des privilèges légaux. 

Le féminisme pourrait peut-être remédier ce genre d'injustice flagrante, au lieu de garantir des places sans mérite aux femmes dans le CAC 40. 


Autre chose: Bien que les statistiques officielles admettent que les hommes représentent 1/4 des victimes(
http://www.haut-conseil-egalite.gouv.fr/violences-de-genre/reperes-statistiques-79/), il est quasiment impossible de trouver des ressources d'aide aux hommes victimes de viol. 



Par contre, des associations féministes d'aide aux victimes  femmes, subventionnées par l'Etat, il y en a à tire-larigo. Tiens, prends celle-là:

""Collectif Féministe Contre le Viol"": Sa ligne téléphone d'aide s'appelle ""SOS Viol Femmes"", les conseils pour les victimes sont au féminin, et comme je disais plus haut, étant féministes, ils minimisent les victimes hommes et les violeurs femmes:



&gt; 96 % des auteurs de viol sont de sexe masculin et 91 % des victimes sont de sexe féminin (statistiques concordantes du ministère de la Justice et du CFCV, Collectif Féministe Contre le Viol)

http://www.manche.gouv.fr/content/download/12137/65047/file/Dossier%20de%20presse%20campagne%202012%20CFCV.pdf

http://www.cfcv.asso.fr/

Ils vont meme jusqu'a dire:

 &gt;Les hommes aussi sont victimes de viol
:
&gt;Vrai, cela peut arriver, mais les
victimes sont des femmes dans 9 cas sur 10. Les hommes victimes de viol étaient le
plus souvent mineurs au moment des faits. Que les victimes soient des hommes ou
des femmes, **99% des agresseurs sont des hommes.**

Si on définissant le viol comme un ""enveloppement"", ce qui est tout aussi arbitraire que ""pénétration"", les femmes représenteraient 80% des violeurs. 

Ah oui, j'oubliais une des raisons du féminisme de minimiser le nombre de femmes qui violent: Leur théorie part du principe que le viol n'a rien à voir avec le sexe, ce n'est qu'une méthode parmi d'autres de domination des hommes sur les femmes. Alors évidemment, des femmes qui violent des hommes, ça la fout mal pour la belle théorie du patriarcat.

Imagine what would happen if every time *you* make a policy proposal I come to you and say ""but it might disturb the markets, forget about it"". Would you consider that a fair argument?

My claim is that the so-called ""liberal"" does not actually care about the likelihood of the unintentional outcome, he only cares to shoot down the policy proposal because it disturbs his ideology of unending individualism and disregard for your fellow human beings. 

This is the problem, as far as I see it: The cultural narrative of what you call liberalism (I would call it by a different name, but it doesn't matter) dictates that everyone should only care about themselves and caring for others will only make them worse off. This provides the perfect rationalisation to avoid any personal responsibility for making society better, as, supposedly, the best thing you can do anyway is mind your own business. 

This policy proposal disturbs this dictate and that's the only actual reason people here are so hesitant towards it. You see, if you and yaix and whoever actually brought forth compelling arguments against this, people should listen to you. But saying ""well, maybe it will create problems"" (as you implied) is pointless and does not add anything to the discussion.

The same reason they spread BS on the TV, to convince people that the evil west is all out to eat russians for breakfeast while really you know we're asking russia to stop invading Ukraine.

They need a kind of immersive alternate reality, a bit of a trueman show to convince the average russians that THEY aren't invading but that it's the evil NATO that's harassing them.

So they make it on tv. On radio. On newspaper. They can control all those in russia. And since the net isn't bowing, they're paying people to game the rules and plaster it with false info embedded with some truethood the average moderatos won't bother censuring. Twisting it just enough to disguise it and pass the usual filters &amp; checks &amp; balance and fill it as what the US loves and call free speech. Also propaganda is a zero risk tool for them; and one they mastered skillfully during the soviet union. Putin's a master at it. So he'll keep using to the bitter end.

&gt; I highly doubt that i am somehow more intelligent than people in charge of these astroturfers, after all, they probably are connected to intelligence services and various think tank groups, to spread ""correct version of events"".

It's not about intelligence. It's about *quantity*. If you hear 10 000 times the same lie from 100 different sources within the same day, you start to wonder whether there isn't a kernel of truth, since ALL THE PEOPLE say the same. And a few months later you start believing nato attacked russia when they use western sanctions to push back russian tanks.

&gt;  this sub however is 100 times lesser, the closest to European official seen here was some Danish lady i think which did an AMA

Most people keep their heads down, but i'm starting to suspect the sub is actually CHOCKEFUL with officials from everywhere within the EU or US/Canada and neighbors. If i were tossing a coin i'd say there are probably over at least half a hundred rankeds and big shots or ex officials hanging around, at the very least lurking.

Die Mehrheit der Menschen geht in den Supermarkt und kauft dort die Lebensmittel ein, die ihnen dort gefallen. Das können sie auch ohne Probleme tun, da alle gehandelten Lebensmittel hinsichtlich ihrer Gesundheitsgefährdung untersucht worden sind. Das einseitige Ernährung, auch in Folge der Inhaltstoffe, zu gesundheitlichen Problemen führen kann, steht völlig außer Frage.
Nun kann man gerne fordern, an jeder noch so kleinen Verkaufseinheit müßte sich eine amtliche Analyse sämtlicher Inhaltstoffe befinden, doch zu welche Zweck? - Und würde der durchschnittliche Konsument in der Lage sein diese Laborergebnisse auch zu interpretieren? Denn wie du schon sagtest, eine Professur in Chemie haben die wenigsten Vorzuweisen. Eine weitere Frage hierzu ist: Würde sich die überwiegende Mehrheit dafür wirklich interessieren und wäre sie bereit die Kosten für derartige Dokumentationen zu übernehmen?

Heute kann jeder, vorausgesetzt es interessiert ihn, leicht nachvollziehen was sich in seinen Lebensmitteln befindet. Sämtliche Zusatzstoffe sind zugelassen und dokumentiert. Wenn nun auf einem Produkt steht ""frei von Konservierungsmitteln"", hat jeder Verbraucher die Sicherheit, dass dieses Produkt keine Stoffe beinhaltet, die als Konservierungsmittel zugelassen wurden (diese Liste ist öffentlich einsehbar).

Abgesehen von solchen Aufdrucken findest du auf allen Lebensmitteln die komplette Zutatenliste. Dort könnte man bspw. statt ""E575"" auch ""Glucono-delta-lacton"" schreiben, nur wie hilft uns das als Verbraucher weiter?

Es hilft alles nichts, gleich wie viel Informationen die Hersteller auf die Verpackungen drucken, der Konsument muß sich am Ende entscheiden. Und diese Entscheidung (über Inhaltstoffe) wird er nur treffen können, wenn er sich mit dem Thema beschäftigt, oder er entscheidet sich einfach nach Geschmack und Geldbeutel.",0,1407610635,null,0,false,0,cjll8et,t3_2d2a6k,t1_cjll8et,t1_cjlk3rd,null,1435155662,0,false,de,t5_22i0,0

awww, and you were doing so well up until that point. I think someone needs a little tutoring on how wealth and value are created becuase 'I created this and added valuye to it' is also a form of ownership. Most things we eat are not readily available in the form you find them in the shop. Bread, for example, requires wheat be grown, milled, kneaded, baked and then distributed to somewhere where you can go and acquire it. There aren't fields of bread everywhere; when someone makes wheat into bread, they add value to it, and save you the cost in time and energy of having to grow, mill and bake the wheat into bread yourself. 

Why would anyone go to that trouble if you're just going to walk off with the bread and not contribute to it's production cost?

I imagine, however, that you are going to point to who owns the field in which the wheat was grown, and here I think your point isn't entirely without merit, in most cases land ownership has been the rseult of 'I was here first' or worse, the result of seisures by the rich and powerful. No doubt, when it comes to land ownership, there have been myriad examples of injustice over the years. But there's little we can do to retify that now, and certianly, abolishing land ownership would do more harm than good. You would create a 'tragedy of the commons' where the lack of ownership causes everyone to over-use a given resource. Furthermore, private ownership of land is one of the best protections we have against predatory businesses. I did a bit of work in Cambodia a few years back, one of the biggest problems the poor faced was being evicted as a result of the government giving their land away to big businesses buying up mining and logging rights. The best protection people often have is to have their land rights protected by law so that they cant be forcibly removed by corrupt governments.

Also,

&gt;You don't have any 'rights,' sorry it to break it to you mr. Brainless fuckshit. The 'right' to own property is nothing but the codified form of the ability to do violence to keep other people from using said property.

and

How would you describe Ukrainian media then and sources that Ukrainian redditors provide here?

As it turned out up until Crimea, all of it was bullshit; but a lie repeated 100 000 times worked pretty well and the sentiment of Euromaidan was **strongly** anti-Russian (including the infamous ""deal"").

 A lot of it was on russian as well and quite a number of videos were debunked as fake being released by SBU, media and various ""activists"", don't you think it also creates a certain ""information field"" which implants certain ideas into subconscious ?


Can't say anything about officials, from what i've seen there seems to be a constant interest from either U.S military or U.S led think-tank groups mostly in regards to united European military. They probe from time to time with ""how would you feel about european military or picking up the required 2.0% NATO spending stuff"" on a regular basis, i guess if they are interested in shifting their focus to ""pivot in Asia"" and Africa.

true,Treesforrests,null,null,"The conjunctive (konjunktiv) in German is kind of difficult for an English speaker to grasp since its use in English is really rather limited and often times colloquially replaced by the indicative. 

German essentially has two basic conjunctives forms: Konjunktiv I and Konjunktiv II. Konjunktiv I is used mainly in journalism and the news because it's a way of showing that the thoughts or ideas expressed don't belong to the speaker, but rather to some other person. It's similar to using ""according to"" in English. 

To form the Konjunktiv I, one takes the present tense stem (schlafen --&gt;schlaf) and adds the Konjunktiv endings, which are as follows:

    -e    -en
    -est  -et
    -e    -en

Thus, 

    ich gehe    wir gehen
    du gehest  ihr gehen
    er gehe     sie gehen

There is a slight problem because the Konjunktiv I is only differentiable from the Präsens Indikativ in the 2nd and 3rd person singular. These are thus the only forms in which it is used.

To form the past tense of Konjunktiv I one must use the ""Perfekt"" construction (haben/sein + past-participle --&gt; ich bin gefahren) with the Konjunktiv I form of haben or sein.

The Konjunktiv I of sein is odd looking:

   ich sei       wir seien
    du seiest    ihr  seiet
    er sei       sie seien

Haben is completely regular. 

Essentially, this isn't used that much except for in the news. You'll find it in older literature as well (Kafka or Rilke for example).

Now for the Konjunktiv II. It is formed by taking the root of the Präteritum (simple past) and adding the conjunctive endings. Strong and mixed verbs will take an umlaut if possible. 

   ich ginge     wir gingen
    du gingest   ihr ginget
    er ginge     sie gingen

    ich brächte    wir brächten
    du brächtest   ihr brächtet
    er brächte     sie brächten

The past tense of the the Konjunktiv II is formed like the Plusquamperfekt, but substituting ""hatte/war"" with the past-tense conjunctive forms (hätte/wäre). 

Essentially the Konjunktiv II expresses what is called the ""irrealis"": anything that hasn't factually happened. In English it is generally used to express desire and in ""if"" statements.

""The stagemanager requests that you be on stage in five minutes."" Here we have ""you be"" instead of the indicative ""you are"". It's expressing the non-reality. You are not currently on stage, but that is what the stagemanager desires. 

In English, constructions such as ""were"", ""would"", ""should"", ""could"", among others all express irrealis. 

* ""What **would** you do if you **were** to die today. (You're probably not going to die today.)

* ""I wish you **were** a better friend. (You're not a good friend, but what if...)

It's used similarly in German, but it's much more distinguishable and common.

""Wenn er die Tür nicht zugeworfen hätte, wäre seine Mutti nicht unsanft aufgeweckt worden."" (""If he hadn't slammed the door, his mom wouldn't have been rudely woken up"") 

""Sie tat so, als ob sie eine Prinzessin wäre"" (""She was acting as though she were a princess."")

You can look back to older literature (again, Kafka) and see the Konjunktiv II used a lot. A lot of forms that were acceptable back then are less acceptable now. ""wäre"", ""hätte"", ""ginge"" are all pretty standard. (It would help if a native speaker weighed in on this here.)

""Würde"" is very commonly used to express irrealis, just as in English, and in colloquial speech it is probably used a lot more than the Konjunktiv forms. 

""Wenn ich nicht so beschäftigt wär', würde ich dir gerne helfen.""         

Basically it's super daunting at first and there's a lot that I didn't say, but you'll begin to get the hang of it.

Getting around in Germany shouldn't be a problem for anybody who speaks English. English has been an obligatory subject for everybody in the West for decades by now, so most people will speak some English, and many speak fluently.

Additionally, Cologne has one of the biggest student populations in all of Germany. The University is the biggest in Germany, there is a huge Technical College and lots of other smaller colleges and unis, so there will be more young, open minded people than in many other places. All of these speak English, and many are from abroad. (It might be an option for you to actually study here for a term, but I have been out of Uni for too long to actually know anything about that. Mind that there are no enrollment fees here, but that may be different for foreigners, especially for those from without the EU.)

But the Unis are also a setback. The market for small, affordable accomodations suffers from high demand, and rents in general have risen to absurdely high figures. You will probably not be able to find a place to live on your own here without a really well paid job. A shared flat (in German ""WG"", as someone said already) would be the most realistic way to live here affordably.

The longer I think about it, the more I find that you really should try to find out how difficult it might be to enroll at the Uni here. You might benefit from many student related ressources even if you actually don't study. The Uni's website is http://www.uni-koeln.de

true,gocarsno,POLA,Poland,"&gt; But the ""liberal"" in this case does not simply say ""be careful"", he presupposes that the idea will have a negative outcome and fails to consider that it might not.

Maybe he considered both outcomes, maybe he jumped to the conclusion - I don't know. In either case, he said nothing that would support your accusation that he puts the idea of a free market above the needs of starving people. He implied nothing about his motives and your accusation seems to be based entirely on your own preconceptions which you describe below.

&gt; This is the problem, as far as I see it: The cultural narrative of what you call liberalism (I would call it by a different name, but it doesn't matter) dictates that everyone should only care about themselves and caring for others will only make them worse off. This provides the perfect rationalisation to avoid any personal responsibility for making society better, as, supposedly, the best thing you can do anyway is mind your own business. 

What you're describing is true of radical libertarian objectivists, like Ayn Rand. Those are rare, particularly in Europe. Most of economic liberals take after John Locke, Friedrich Heyek and Milton Friedman, none of whom denied the value of altruism and social responsibility. That's the dominant school.

&gt;  You see, if you and yaix and whoever actually brought forth compelling arguments against this, people should listen to you. But saying ""well, maybe it will create problems"" (as you implied) is pointless and does not add anything to the discussion. On the other hand, saying ""yes, it will undoubtedly create problems"" without evidence (like yaix is doing) is disingenuous. 

I actually don't have an opinion on this particular issue and I agree that yaix's objections seem a bit thin. However, I still think they add something to the discussion because it's very easy to just instinctively conclude the policy is a good idea, without considering unintended consequences. yaix's comment provoked a lot of people to  debate the possible results of the policy, so you really can't say it ""is pointless and does not add anything to the discussion"".

&gt; La constitution de la République populaire de Chine, dont tous les habitants ont, selon le droit du sol, la « citoyenneté chinoise », reconnaît en outre selon le droit du sang et selon le modèle soviétique, 56 « ethnies » appelées « nationalités » (小组民族 : xiǎozǔ mínzú = ""nation groupée"", ou 族 : zú pouvant signifier ""clan"", ""groupe"", ""peuple"", ""ethnie"", ""tribu"")13, dont les Hans, qui représentent 92 % de la population, mais sont eux-mêmes linguistiquement divisés, avec plusieurs dialectes, et plusieurs variantes régionales du chinois mandarin.

It's true in the sense that it was the goal. It never happened of course. By the time something like the ""Soviet people"" started forming, it wasn't long until the end of the USSR.

But let's not forget that this ""Soviet nation"" was being built with Russians as the basis. While theoretically the Russian language was equal to the national languages in the Soviet countries, in practice the Soviets made an effort to establish Russian as superior. The Soviet government came up with new alphabets just for that. Tatar, Kazakh, Uzbek and some other languages were written in the Arab script in the early 20th century, but the Soviet government instituted Cyrillic-based alphabets for all of those. Getting into schools that do not teach in Russian became more and more difficult.

If I look at my old Soviet documents, there are some that are bilingual, with text in Latvian and Russian, and there are some that are only in Russian, but none written in Latvian only. This corresponds to the general pattern of what was happening in the smaller Soviet countries. The smaller nations (Latvians, Lithuanians, Tajiks, and so on) had to learn Russian, while the ethnic Russians moving to those regions wouldn't learn Latvian or Tajik. Same happened even in parts that were part of Soviet Russia and now Russia, like Tatarstan.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; How would you describe Ukrainian media then and sources that Ukrainian redditors provide here?

On the ""opinion side"", they *hate* the russian **armed** separatists, and mostly see locals (even russian nationals) as victims. Am i wrong ?

I saw some propaganda too, but cross checking with multiple sources still allow you to see throught. International sources concurs at like 70/80% with Ukrainian news and 30/40% russian ones. Says volumes, imho.

&gt; and the sentiment of Euromaidan was strongly anti-Russian 

Well, they just got invade by a russian army. If there was an US army in Vladivostok suddenly you probably would be frothing at the mouth too. However, i'd say it was hate for acts *they openly did commit* (Crimea IS annexed by russia), so it's a bit more ""legitimate"". Not counting Kremlin backed Yanoukovitch era corruption that hollowed out the country. Maidan was on the front line of how horrible Yanou' fucked up the entire ukrainian country. It was the main reason of the revolution.

&gt; A lot of it was on russian as well and quite a number of videos were debunked as fake being released by SBU,

Uh, most of the SBU release i saw were truth actually and crosschecked by a large number of sources AND fit within the picture of what i expected. But bear in mind the SBU itself did not release a lot. Probably like 15 videos top, and mostly separatists recorded phone calls they did later confirm themselves in interviews.

You got to keep in mind, the West is a bloc of allies. Russia is a single country. While there IS propaganda in the west, it's not really coordinated or badly so, so if you want to cross check, you can easily. For example the Ukr gov doesn't control UK or canadian medias. In russia, a single state apparatus got its hand on all medias and is busy binding the net as much as possible (wasn't free &amp; open wifi made illegal 2 days ago in russia ?).

&gt; They probe from time to time with ""how would you feel about european military or picking up the required 2.0% NATO spending stuff"" on a regular basis, i guess if they are interested in shifting their focus to ""pivot in Asia"" and Africa.

The difference was the EU was trying to acquire it's independance from the NATO army on the defense side (iraq wasn't well received here, to say the least). But since Russia is basically posturing openly to attack our eastern border and the US are their natural ennemy and our big allies, it flies throught the windows now, and for a number of years.

&gt; Russia's actions in Ukraine helped a lot i am sure of it :)

Well ironically, the EU was trying to integrate them and pressuring the US into it. The Kremlin and dugin and the idiots listening to him fucked up everything. But true, i guess blame is to be shared. We did antagonize them (unwillingly) in lybia, Syria (probably our greatest recent fuck up.

It depends on what you're looking for, but honestly one of my favorite restaurants in Madrid is Baco y Beto.  It's completely unassuming, just a little restaurant in the middle of Chueca (the gay barrio) that makes killer dishes. I found it through a rave Lonely Planet recommendation and I've become a regular (about once a week). Order half orders of a few different things, because it's all delicious, but don't pass up the mushrooms.  Everyone who works there is wonderful and it's all cooked by Beto.


If you want a nice dinner that doesn't break the bank, you might want to try La Pescaderia in Malasaña, it's trendy at the moment so make a reservation.  It's the mid-30s yuppie crowd mostly, and they also flock pretty frequently to La Mucca, which is italian-spanish fusion.  It's pretty good as well. 

If you want to try different tapas, I'd recommend strolling down calle Cava Baja in the evening and stopping into a few different places, or going to one of the markets (Mercado San Miguel is the most famous, though more expensive) and strolling through them with a glass of wine trying different things. 

If you want a good ""menu del dia,"" or fixed-price lunch (mon - friday, very common everywhere), I recommend Momo, in Chueca.  Great food. 

OH! If you're a ""foodie"" in any way, the new enfant terrible in the culinary world is David Muñoz (mohawk, gauges, etc), his Madrid restaurant called Diverxo (pronounsed Diverso) just earned 3 michelin stars.  Anyway, he designed the menu of a spanish-asian fusion place called Streetxo that's cheaper (10 euros a dish) but it's still amazingly good and much more accessible than the five-month waiting list/ 200 euro dinner you'd get at his flagship restaurant.  It's on the top floor of the Corte Inglés in Callao.  It's almost grab-and-go style, so don't go expecting a sit-down type restaurant, but it's worth checking out anyway if you get the chance, just for the food.

C'est plutôt toi qui t'es planté en citant qu'une seule ligne dans un rapport de 100 pages sans te tenir compte de leurs conclusions. Tu essaies de faire croire aux autres qu'un document, dont la conclusion est que les hommes sont toutefois responsables de la plupart des viols, dit qu'ils ne le sont pas. J'ai tout simplement démontré ton tort.

&gt;J'ai jamais dis ça de ma vie.

Ah oui ? Montre-moi là où tu te soucies des problématiques féminins. Jusqu'à présent tu n'en as rien à cirer, tu les minimises d'ailleurs pour parler que des injustices envers les hommes.

&gt;Bon, j'ai fait quelques recherches. Alors apparemment, en France, ""faire pénétrer"" ne compte pas comme un viol légalement. Le viol requiert, encore une fois, la pénétration.

Et alors ? Tu as déjà admis que cela n'est pas à cause du féminisme, mais tu rechignes à admettre que c'est à cause des vieilles attitudes sexistes, d'ailleurs très prônées dans les cercles MRA que tu fréquentes. Les mêmes attitudes sexistes contre lesquelles le féminisme lutte.

&gt;Le féminisme pourrait peut-être remédier ce genre d'injustice flagrante, au lieu de garantir des places sans mérite aux femmes dans le CAC 40.

Attends. Tu te moques ouvertement du féminisme, tu cherches à amoindrir l'importance des violences commises contre les femmes, tu es modérateur d'un subreddit qui s'appelle ""MisogynyCentral"" et tu t'attends pourtant à ce que les femmes et les féministes s'occupent de ta cause ? T'as un sacré culot. Je ne vais pas me plaindre pour toi si tu te retrouves tout seul dans ton combat.

Pourquoi le MRA, d'ailleurs, ne s'occupe-t-il pas des problèmes féminins ? Pourquoi ne t'occupes-tu pas du plus grand problème qu'est la violence sexuelle contre les femmes ? Tu attends à ce que ton combat soit soutenu par les autres, mais tu ne lèves pas un doigt, d'après ce que je vois, pour les combats des autres. C'est salement hypocrite.

&gt;Autre chose: Bien que les statistiques officielles admettent que les hommes représentent 1/4 des victimes( http://www.haut-conseil-egalite.gouv.fr/violences-de-genre/reperes-statistiques-79/[2] ), il est quasiment impossible de trouver des ressources d'aide aux hommes victimes de viol.
Par contre, des associations féministes d'aide aux victimes femmes, subventionnées par l'Etat, il y en a à tire-larigo. 

Tu reconnais que les femmes sont trois fois plus souvent victimes de violences sexuelles que les hommes, et ça t'étonne qu'il existe davantage de services pour aider les femmes ? 

Ensuite, tout comme la définition légale du viol, la pénurie de services pour hommes est un produit du machisme qui veut qu'il n'y a rien de plus honteux pour un homme que d'être violé par une femme (à part le déclarer à quelqu'un), que c'est une marque de faiblesse qu'un homme voit un psy et déclare son chagrin, qu'un vrai homme viril ne peut pas être sexuellement passif et dominé par une femme, et ainsi de suite. Les hommes, eux-mêmes convaincus par ce discours, préfèrent ni déclarer les agressions qu'il subissent, ni chercher de l'aide, pour évider le risque d'être traité de PD ou d'impuissant. Rien de ce que tu dis ne me fait croire que tu t'intéresses à ce problème. C'est d'assez mauvaise foi.

Encore un fois, tu te plains, mais tu t'attends à ce que tout soit fait pour toi par autrui. Si le mouvement MRA consacrait plus de temps à fonder des associations pour secourir les hommes violés que de baver sur les féministes sur internet, il pourrait avoir des vrais progrès dans ce domaine.

&gt;Les hommes aussi sont victimes de viol : Vrai, cela peut arriver, mais les victimes sont des femmes dans 9 cas sur 10. Les hommes victimes de viol étaient le plus souvent mineurs au moment des faits. Que les victimes soient des hommes ou des femmes, 99% des agresseurs sont des hommes.

C'est dommage de lire ça, puisqu'on sait que c'est faux. Cependant, ça ne permet pas de mettre tous les féministes dans le même panier. C'est une organisation parmi tant d'autres, et ça ne correspond point au discours que je vois dans la plupart des textes féministes, ou en parlant avec des femmes qui se considèrent féministes. 

&gt;Leur théorie part du principe que le viol n'a rien à voir avec le sexe, ce n'est qu'une méthode parmi d'autres de domination des hommes sur les femmes. Alors évidemment, des femmes qui violent des hommes, ça la fout mal pour la belle théorie du patriarcat.

Je ne prête pas trop d'attention aux valeurs que tu attribues aux féministes, comme s'il s'agissait d'un bloc monolithique, ayant une bible, une doctrine, et un pape. Ton association à la misogynie, ainsi que les propos que tu as défendus ci-dessous, ne laissent croire à personne que tu puisses les décrire objectivement.

It could be said the 2% target is reasonable, yet NATO members cant seem to meet it. Worse, many seem to use NATO membership as an excuse to cut their budgets. 

I would use the Baltics as a perfect example. They pledged to meet the 2% target, but only Estonia has come close. I would not support any nations joining unless there was an enforcement mechanism to make sure members met their obligations. It has been shown time and time again NATO members cant simply be taken at their word. So it is nothing against Finland specifically, more the fact that NATO has no mechanism to make sure members meet their targets. I think that needs to change before any new members are admitted. Because it is very clear saying a country will meet the 2% goal is much easier than making it actually happen.

This one is for first Chechen campaign.


For second one, what should Russia do if 10k of ""enlightened freedom fighters"" invaded neighbor republic and started killing people with all the usual stops of: ""nice"" videos of beheadings, rapes, kidnappings, theft, violence and hostage/ransom situations (list goes on)? 

Basically, what should have Russia done if ISIS invaded Dagestan right about now? Politely ask them to leave and stop or take it up the ass?


I am sure you can come up with a great plan to solve all world problems.


Edit to your edit, so you base your viewpoint on assumptions and wishful thinking that Russians just packed their things and left all the republics and actions of people from these republics had nothing to do with it, right? Then why is that Russians are not returning back to their homes then, i mean, no one is carpet bombing them anymore, so its totally is ok right?

Personally I have little trust in the workings of the Russian democracy. But it is not exactly rational to accept the handful of Strelkov's ramblings that fit our preconceptions while ridiculing the man for his other lunatic ideas.

Strelkov's theory about a central agency deciding the winner through some quick keystrokes on a computer has a typical conspiracy theory feel to it. In reality forging nation wide elections is quite a bit more difficult and subtle.

It's also unlikely that the GRU tells all their low ranking members how and where the elections are forged. So how does Strelkov even know this but through hear say?",0,1407615952,null,0,1407616193,0,cjlncgu,t3_2d2bgj,t1_cjlncgu,t1_cjlcvmd,null,1435156719,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Many of the Iraqi Kurds seemed to identify more with Iraq than say Turkish Kurds. While Turkish Kurds seemed to totally identify as Kurdish, and not Turkish. Those who identified as Iraqi seemed to want to keep the semiautonomus status as opposed to a whole new country. But there is a very strong portion of the region that would like autonomy. 

Its crazy, the Christian suburb of Erbil I had to go to to buy alcohol is overrun with Christian refugees now. Glad to see the US and UK began delivering aid and that France has pledged to take more Christian refugees (hopefully more countries will extend that offer to Christians and Yizidis from the area). Being American, I would like to see the US step up and begin accepting more refugees from the region, although, as I am sure you know, we have a major situation of our own at the moment.
