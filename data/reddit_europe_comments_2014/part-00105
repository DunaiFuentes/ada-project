true,Prestian,BELG,"Flanders, Belgium","It's difficult, because the royal family is also a symbol for Belgian unity and plays an important role in the formation of a federal government.

This is why, as far as I know, the Walloons are rather in favour of the monarchy, although they are much more ~~progressive and Enlightment-minded~~ socialist and liberal. While in more conservative Flanders the monarchy isn't that popular, especially not with the Flemish-nationalists (who are ironically also the most conservative voices in Flemish politics).

The biggest chunk of the political elite (christian democrats, socialists, liberals) on both sides of the language border is in favour of the monarchy though. I think the biggest part of the population just doesn't care, because ""a president is just as expensive anyway"".

I don't know what would happen if the monarchy was abandoned. I don't think it would cause massive monarchist rallies. It might cause Belgian nationalist/unionist/federalist rallies.

So aside from the royal family's uniting role, I don't think the monarchy is very popular amongst the people. Especially not compared to the Netherlands or the UK.

(My views are a bit different from the rest of the population here. I'm very anti-monarchy but not out of flemish-nationalism. I don't really care about any nationalism; Flemish seperatism or Belgian unionism are non-issues imo. I do care about and loathe the idea that a person in this day and age can still rule over me just because he was born.

Back in the very early 00s I remember reading a very interesting series of research papers/opinion articles (the names of which escape me right now) dealing mostly with the right-wing youth culture or right-wing movements in Europe. The approach taken was socio-cultural, however, economics wasn't really a deciding factor (then again, the economic hardships were kind of far away).

Amongst many things the papers talked about the solidification of liberal ideology within the mainstream. From the 60s-70s onwards the liberal left and the many youth movements supporting it, gradually established itself as the dominant culture of the west.

The German Greens, for example, were viewed as nothing other than hippies (this sentiment still exists of course) yet established themselves as a relatively (I stress ""relatively"" here. Compared to these beginning http://www.zdf.de/ZDFmediathek/contentblob/1375612/timg644x363blob/4396855) serious party later on. Main parties of course like the CDU or the SPD did encapsulate a lot of the left's (not limited to the Greens) ideology and are now considered to be centre-left mostly. Of course, we should also remember that Germany is a special case, dominant parties had to adopt liberal ideology fairly swiftly.

What those papers stressed is the left's initial appeal as a counter culture and how well it managed to attract the youth. The main points: the left was firstly untainted (it was simply young), it was in its ""resistance"" phase, the centre-right/right ideology was dominant, the left was seen as edgy.

The papers then argued that because of this juxtapositioning the conservative right will be viewed as ""edgy"" eventually. It will gain some voice firstly because events of the past will seem very distant to the youth and basically because it will be viewed as an alternative to perceived hardships. I personally don't believe that this would sway things purely based on this very bit alone (after all, the left didn't become dominant by being edgy...), but given the right circumstances, it might contribute some.

For me the root of the issue is certain nationalist ideas, which given the opportunity, always come up to the surface in Europe. You might disagree with this and quote various examples of working multicultural models within Europe and this is definitely a good argument to make, yet I think we have to do much more. 

For example, a national identity based on heritage can and will eventually turn into an issue. This is certainly very hard to address in Europe, seeing as countries and peoples have existed here, in one form or another, for thousands of years. Ethnic heritage, cultural heritage, etc. There's the question of ""What makes a European a European."" and the easiest answer (please note, this is not exactly the right answer or maybe the answer we should strive for) is rooted in nationalism. Compare this to the US (which again is of course unique) where national identity is established by acceptance of certain values (this however is changing in certain parts). 

We also have the economic situation right now. The left will be blamed by association here. Certain policies of the left like immigration, etc, etc will be picked on (again this is connected to what exactly establishes identity in Europe and is a question that needs to be addressed I believe).

Oh? Well, go ahead and ask Russia have they sent any troops in... they'll outright deny it. You're claiming they've sent some? Prove it. If you question these masked men, they'll probably hit you in the face with the butt of their gun, or they'll just say they're here because they support their Russian brothers, or something along those lines, and even if they admit who they are, the Russian government will deny any involvement.

Russia, **officially**, is NOT involved in any of this with their own troops. Unofficially, I know they're involved, you know they're involved, the EU knows, the US knows, my dead grandma knows. But in order to deny their involvement and wash their hands of this, they can't weasel in thousands of troops over the border and say ""wasn't us"", they need advisers, weapon procurers, undocumented soldiers in smaller numbers which will form a resistance from the locals and stir shit up. This is a tried and true recipe that was used by the Russians and the US for decades.

true,yourslice,null,null,"I have a theory about this that I think is pretty rock solid.  

I think this occurs most especially with female college-age Americans in Italy and other countries in Europe.  Here's why: first consider American university culture.  This is the time in US society that people tend to explore themselves sexually.  US style college partying and hooking up is not found everywhere outside of the states.  

Next consider how loads and loads of US college students hit up Europe for a semester abroad, or for longer periods or just for pack packing and general travel.  They are of that age and that mentality of hooking up.  And now you add in the excitement of a foreign man with a sexy accent and a foreign way of romancing you.  No judgements here, but a lot of American girls hook up with at least somebody while in Europe.  

So the Italian/European men are getting US chicks at the peak moment, when they are in ""university sexual exploration"" age and ""foreign excitement/vacation mode"" when they are easiest to woo.  Lucky them!  

Their success rate becomes far greater than with the average local woman.  The Italian/European man assumes that US women are slutty and of course pass this info along to their buddies and the results are what you have found.  They then become aggressive towards the women and the cycle continues.  

Another factor: US clothing norms are different and some are quite revealing.  Sure, you'll see European women showing off what they've got when they go to discos but think about how many American girls wear short...VERY short shorts on a normal Tuesday afternoon.  Totally normal and acceptable in the states, but it's certainly not what women everywhere wear.  

These have been my observations from living as a man in a University town in Spain as well as from having conversations with other men.  

And by the way, the fact is American women aren't as slutty as they seem!  It's the above factors that make the average woman abroad sluttier...but back home there are plenty of women that are nothing like that.  It's a certain type of girl who goes abroad anyway.  A certain demographic and a certain personality.  

tl;dr:  American girls are thought to be easy because the ones who go abroad statistically are.

What you're left with is an effective composite liberal ideology running Europe which is arguably not far from anarcho-capitalism in actual realization, all the liberal ideals allowed at once with few to none of the controls, as it happens that's one of the worst situations possible because utopian ideals are impossible to sustain in the real world at present.

My personal opinion is that a lot of far-right people seem to hate ""the west"" with their values and perceived weakness as well, so they are basically hating themselves. That is why a lot of people in Germany are pro-Russian. They are pro-Putin just to be contrarian, because he is the exact opposite: strong, anti-gay/feminist, cold.

I have not heard the ""Europe encircled by enemies"" theory before. The USA does not hate us, they are our stronger/brasher twins. The muslims are already either inside the country and face integration conflicts or separated by sea or having a try with democracy themselves at the moment. Many arabian/Maghrebinian intellectuals visit the EU. Russia has not been an enemy, totalitarian or brainwashed before, that is why the crimean crisis is kind of shocking to us. Again, a lot of Russian intellectuals visit and interact with Germany. One of the newspaper dailies I read had a different Russian intellectual commenting/reporting almost every second day (part of why I love serious print-media dailies).

On the question why the far left is not gaining, I think that is actually a very interesting one. It might be because the continents had mirrored developments.

The article is intelligently written.

It contains relevant facts:

""In 2010-11, the most recent period for which we have figures, 15,584 estates of 259,989 notified for probate paid inheritance tax. That is approximately 3% of all deaths that year. Already, inheritance tax is paid by a tiny fraction of all estates. The asset composition of these estates remains stable over time, with property composing about 50% of taxable estates; a disproportionate number of these are located in London and the south-east, reflecting the rocketing house prices in that corner of the country. The ""nil-rate threshold"" – the value under which inherited wealth is untouched by tax – currently stands at £325,000, frozen since April 2009. But that's only half the story. Since 2007, it has been possible for spouses to transfer their unused nil-rate band allowance to their surviving partner. This has lifted many estates in the £300-500,000 band out of inheritance tax altogether: at this point we are beginning to talk about substantial, indeed life-altering, sums of money.""

It thoughtfully discusses why inheritance could be considered a problem:

""Why do we permit this? The transfer of wealth between generations is an injustice: it is a reward for no work, and a form of access to privileges that are otherwise beyond reach. Professor Thomas Piketty, in his new book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, makes the argument that, after a social-democratic blip in the middle of the last century, inheritance is once again becoming the key route to wealth. Piketty argues that if wealth is concentrated and the return on capital is higher than the economy's growth rate, inherited wealth will grow more rapidly than that stemming from work. This returns us to the terrain of Balzac and Austen, where the road to financial security is to target those who already possess wealth and, where possible, marry them. The data Piketty analyses – a huge and comprehensive set – suggests that the proportion of people receiving a sum in inheritance larger than the lifetime earnings of the bottom 50% is set to return to 19th-century levels in the next couple of decades. Pleasant news for our neo-Victorian government; less pleasant for the rest of us, and a disaster for anyone who cares about inequality.""

It is an article that will make people think.  It contains no logical fallacies that I noticed.  It does not make assertions without explaining the reasoning behind them.  It cites its sources for key data and analysis.

true,100courics,HUNG,Hungary,"Haha no, nothing of the sort. Russia does want Hungary out of the EU. Here's how Jobbik came into contact with the Russians: originally, it had nothing to do with the Putin regime. It began as a democratic forum among Hungarian college students. Only three or four years later did it get hijacked by what would become its current leadership. 

The Jobbik leadership is more stupid than malevolent (not that it absolves them of anything). They get money from Russia because they think Russia will help Hungary become a truly-sovereign nation by separating it from the EU. Not once has it turned up in their minds that Russia would then just engulf Hungary. They believe Hungary can get by in the 21st century without picking teams, like Switzerland and Austria. Now if we could just achieve their credit ratings....

The point is, nobody aside from them stands for that. The overwhelming majority of Hungarians still can't stand Russia - not only for what they did to us, but also for what they did in the war with the Poles for example. Jobbik will either acclimate itself to moderation or will ultimately remain a party on the periphery.

We have three national holidays, two of which have to do with fighting against Russians (one of them only indirectly - the Austrians were the main antagonists of that one). Nobody aside from these insane fucks wants to have anything to do with Russia. However, I should also include the current PM in the group, ""insane fucks"". Not his party though, so too bad they don't have the balls to sack him.

Hallo /u/Kerstin-Huber, daß Du Deine Artikel (außer auf Deiner Profilseite) nirgends finden kannst liegt daran daß ich sie schon wenige Momente nachdem Du sie gepostet hattest als Spam markiert und wieder ""entsorgt"" habe. Das mod-team von /r/de besteht nämlich ausschliesslich aus alten Trappern denen man bekanntlich nicht in den Colt scheissen kann und PR-Postings wie Deine überleben hier keine Minute.

Die Leute posten hier weil es Ihnen um die Inhalte und die Community geht und nicht um Reichweite und finanzielle Interessen. Ausserdem können sie hier sicher sein keinen Spam untergejubelt zu bekommen.

&gt; Gibt es einen Geheimtipp, um mehr Reichweite zu erzielen? 

Ja, den gibt es: Gestalte die zu verbreitenden Inhalte in Form eines Image-Macros und poste sie in /r/AdviceAnimals.

&gt; Optisch anspruchsvoll und übersichtlich sieht zudem anders aus und die Schrift ist zu klein bzw. es sind keine Abstände dazwischen.

C'est trop facile de faire des petites transactions entre adultes, de dire que le donneur n'est pas lié à l'enfant, que les parents ont le droit de faire ce qui leur convient sans en informer l'enfant. 

Savoir qui l'ont est et d'où l'on vient n'est pas qu'une option ou qu'une possibilité pour l'enfant mais peut souvent être un besoin essentiel qui ne doit pas être empêché par des règles injustes de protection. Car qui protège-t-on réellement dans ce cas-là ? Les parents qui n'assument pas, le donneur qui n'assume pas, l'Etat qui n'assume pas. L'enfant, lui, se retrouve impuissant. 

A mon sens, la levée possible, à la demande, de l'anonymat des dons répond à un pragmatisme double : 

- Limiter les dérives idéologiques sur le droit à l'enfant, l'enfant n'est jamais qu'un intrus dans le projet parental. Il n'y a pas souscrit. Quelles que soient les raisons qui poussent à un don anonyme, elles ne sont pas celles de l'enfant. Et il s'agit pour moi des mêmes principes que ceux qu'on doit opposer aux mutilations religieuses ou aux styles de vie qui nuisent à l'enfant. 

- Limiter les conséquences néfastes du maintien d'une position intenable au vu des évolutions naturelles du progrès, càd la diffusion des techniques de génomique. La loi ne pourra éternellement garantir un anonymat et le risque est grand qu'on punisse à tort des gens en quête de réponses. 

Je ne me fais pas tellement d'illusions néanmoins, comme ceux qui veulent des GPA, il y a toujours des recours : Aller à l'étranger, prendre des inconnus pour être sûr d'effacer le père biologique, etc. Mais il ne faut pas se leurrer.

Enfin l'auteur reproche à une étude épidémiologique de ne pas conclure directement que c'est la faute des pesticides. Peut-être parce que c'est une étude statistique, qui pose les bases d'une future étude qui s'intéressera justement aux produits phytosanitaires?

&gt;__Orujo__ is a [pomace brandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy#Pomace_brandy) (a [liquor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_beverage) obtained from the distillation of [marc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomace), the solid remains left after pressing of the [grape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape)) from northern Spain.  It is a transparent spirit with an alcohol content over 50% (100° [proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_(alcohol\))). Its name comes from the expression ""aguardiente de orujo"" (pomace firewater).

&gt;It is a popular beverage in northwest Spain, especially [Galicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Spain\)), where it is called *aguardente* (firewater) or *caña*,  and is an element of collective identity. It is also known in [Asturias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturias), [Castile and León](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castile_and_Le%C3%B3n), and [Cantabria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantabria_(community_in_Spain\)) (principally in the valley of [Liébana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li%C3%A9bana)), where it has become an artisanal craft for some families who after making wine for themselves distil the pomace in a little [pot still](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pot_still). Many high-quality distilled spirits have appeared in the last twenty years, including some origin appellations (in Spanish D.O.). These are obtained from quality grapes and produced according to the highest standards and are replacing the traditional home made liquor, nowadays only available in small villages.

D'apres eux l'impact de l'abeille domestique sur la pollinisation est tres exagere dans la presse (ou plutot, l'impact des autres insectes est tres minimise). D'ailleurs, l'abeille sauvage est, d'apres eux, une bien meilleure espece pollinisatrice.

Russia capitalized on strong pro Russian sentiment in the Crimea to gain a military foothold by means of ""self defense forces"". The same script appears to be playing out in eastern Ukraine.

- They admire strong men (or woman in this case) in general. They often say mainstream politicians in France are weak and will accept anything rather than say no and risk offending a partner (usually it means the US or Germany), even when it is detrimental to the French people. Nobody can deny Putin is a strong man willing to go to extreme measures.
- They revere the will of the people, and it is in that sense that they are populists. They claim France is not managed according to what the people wants but according to the will of the elite. It follows naturally that they will support the right of a people to self-determination, and claim the Crimea vote was the result of a democratic choice (I don't want to debate whether it's true or not, just saying it's their opinion).
- They approve the treatment of homosexuals in Russia because they opposed gay marriage before it became legal. Putin is for them an example of how it is possible to deal with homosexuals. They have the same fear that the traditional family model is being attacked and should be protected.
- They view him as a protector of the Russian Orthodox church and disapprove the separation of the Ukrainian church from it. It is a bit complex because the FN has a complicated history with religion and secularism, but the FN is generally traditionalist and pro-catholic. It means they approve of a strong church but separate from the State. Of course the Church should support the State.
- They have similar foreign enemies  with Putin (US, Germany, Israel). The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
- They are against the EU, and try to limit its influence. Putin wants to support that policy.
- They hate islamists as much as Putin, and support the crackdown in the Caucasus.
- They don't want France to intervene in Syria, just like Putin

In deeply democratic countries like AU or US people see politics as something done by themselves. In countries lacking these traditions people simply think that there is an elite group of leaders, an entirely different class, so to speak, the aristocrats, so to speak, and the goal of democratic elections is to choose one part of this elite over another.

Basically we don't really see average people just making candidates and going up into this elite. The view is just more stratified. And the customarily ""left"" part of the elite is basically worn out, gets no confidence.

I think one of the reasons the Orbán part, the ""right"" part of the elite (although left an right makes no sense here, this is no ideological, but personal, a lot of things Orbán did was not traditionally ""right wing"" in the Western sense e.g. a huge fine on the corporation responsible for the red sludge disaster) is kind of still popular is their politics is not really ideologically right-wing in any sense but more like - as they themselves describe it - an ""unorthodoxy"", something new.

Basically it is anything that was tried led to disaster, so there is some hope that something untried maybe helps.

Because if the Orbán ""unorthodoxy"" doesn't work the country is really dead. Young people move abroad, taxpayers move abroad, all that will be left is tax-consuming retirees and the Roma on welfare, and then CRASH.

Ce qui est sûr, c'est que l'antifascisme est protéiforme, et par définition, parler d'*anti-* ne dit à peu près rien sur l'appartenance politique ; il y a des antifa anarchistes, communistes, trotskistes, autonomes... et pourquoi pas, quelques hools peu politisés et amateurs de baston (mais très probablement moins que dans le ""camp d'en face"")

Il faut aussi garder à l'esprit que ça correspond en grande partie à un désir de ne pas ""laisser la rue"" à l'extrême-droite, et bien souvent, d'une *réaction* face à des violences avérées, [notamment à Lyon, par exemple](http://rebellyon.info/Retour-sur-2-ans-de-lutte-a-Lyon.html). 

Après, on peut s'interroger sur l'efficacité (tactique aussi bien que médiatique) d'une réponse ""militaire"" à l'extrême-droite, c'est sûr.

Chouard et Le Pen, Faurisson et Collon, Soral et Asselineau, ou encore Serge Ayoub et Jean Bricmont, dans un grand sac fourre-tout commode, étiquetté ""fasciste"", quand leurs discours sont en pratique assez distincts ... mais il faut bien avouer aussi que ces zigotos-là facilitent pas mal cet amalgame, en volant régulièrement les uns au secours des autres, au nom de la fameuse liberté-d'expression-qui-a-bon-dos (bon, peut-être pas Asselineau, ok ; celui-là est tout seul dans sa tête).

I like how he made Russian people proud to be Russian again. This may sound stupid but I think Russia is a great country with a rich culture and history and I really did not like what they looked like immediatly after the fall of USSR. French people really would need a little pride boost because I am sick of French people always saying France is the worst when it is completly untrue. I think this attitude is highly detrimental to France.

Putin is a great counter power to USA. While I am all in favor of our nearly 200 years long partnership with them, I think a little competition to them can only be beneficial in the long term. 

Putin is highly pragmatic and that is something I wish I would see more often among world leaders. Eg : In Syria. Taking the resistance (in big part made up of religious extremists armed by the Emirates) side was completly stupid for USA and France, if they win they will find themselves with a Syrian government entirely sold to the Emirates and hostile to the West and if Bachar wins he will certainly not forget who protected him during the conflict and who tried to overthrow him. We therefore put ourselves in a lose-lose situation without winning anything from it. That was just plain stupid and I think we should not have meddled into it or maybe just within a ""peacekeeping"" mission where a the US and France collaborated with Russia militarily to stop hostilities in a purely neutral way. Instead of that they flexed their muscles and demanded things which was completly stupid and unrealistic.

Now I do not condone his laws on the ""pro-homo propaganda"" (homosexuality itself is not forbidden, but it has to remain far from children) even though I understand he did it only to satisfy his conservative electorate.

Basically Putin to me is everything our own politicians are not : he can show strenght when necessary but also knows when political finesse is more apropriate.

* * *

Story for those Redditors who don't read Hungarian. Fidesz is planning to build a memorial of the German WW2 occupation of Hungary which would basically present the country as innocent and entirely taken over by a foreign evil, suggesting that the killing of 600K Hungarian Jews is entirely the Germans fault and we were innocent. Of course it was not so. At any rate, this is not an important issue, and when interviewer Olga Kálmán asked (very roughly, independent opposition, LMP) politician András Schiffer about it, he said he dislikes it but he would like to focus on more important stuff like unemployment. Olga Kálmán basically had the kind of meltdown  you rarely see from a professional TV interviewer. Basically she was incredibly upset to the point of non-coherence rejecting the idea that anyone would DARE anything  consider more important than a memorial visually suggesting the innocence of the country in mass murders 70 years ago?!!....

Because as things stand now, the parliament is favorable to the west, and parliamentary elections, even if they probably wouldn't, may pose a risk to that. However, the why is just speculative and besides the point; that the west didn't push for presidential elections is a fact. Presidential elections would have reduced the feeling of undemocratic coup in the mind of many Ukrainians, and delegitimised Putin's claims in that direction.

&gt; Separatism is not a right.

I don't think you get what I'm saying. Rights are ultimately subjective (with only some of them being supported and enforced by legislation), and in the mind of many people in Crimea, they had the right to democratically determine the future of them and their land. By not giving them the possibility to do that democratically, Putin got a perfect excuse to legitimise his invasion in the minds of many people (by organising a referendum himself with a democratic facade).

There are courses of action, there are causes, and there are consequences. The current situation is a direct result of both Russia's and the west's actions.

Yes, but weirdly in Western Europe this does not really happen, I don't know why. In Hungary basically nationalist rock music is currently the ONLY rebellious music based subculture, rebellious in the sense of past punks or hippie rockers. They are so popular it is almost starting to overshadow mainstream rock. They are not like the UK skinhead rock, they are more history based  rather than race based, focusing on the 1919 cutting up of the country.

Now, despite the relative popularity of Hans-Christian Strache in Austria, I seriously don't seen anything like an edgy, musical, youth counter-culture on the Austrian Right. Or anywhere else in Western Europe? Can you imagine Lega Nord or Vlaams Block or Swedendemocrats organizing counter-cultural rock concerts with a full rebellious punk-like subculture with their own subcultural monikers? 

Actually, they are mostly an old people party.

I mean in Hungary this rebellious right-wing youth subculture is so developed in cultural monikers, that it has e.g. a sports wing, some folks focus on traditional horse archery, others claim to have invented a new martial art called baranta based on how old shepherds fought.

&gt;The __Cassoeula__ (from old *cazza*), sometimes Italianized *Cazzuola* (Italian word for [trowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trowel)) or bottaggio (probably derived from the French word potage) is a typical winter dish popular in Northern [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), mostly in [Lombardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy). The dish has a strong, decisive flavour, and was a favourite of conductor [Arturo Toscanini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arturo_Toscanini).  One writer describes it as a ""noble, ancient Milanese dish"",  and writes of the inexpressible ""pleasure that it furnishes the soul as well as the palate, especially on a wintry day"".

OK there is either I am not seeing something obvious or you don't. But it must be something obvious.

Basically  the whole socialism (social democracy) stuff is based on the idea that capitalists NEED workers. So they can have demands. But when basically every productive business can be transfered to China and the rich people can live in tax heavens, and theoretically you could have 25% unemployment and hardly any tax revenue because it all fled, how exactly to squeeze them?

So for me it is fairly obvious that today that kind of social democracy is not possible because it is the constant threat ""raise my tax and I leave, taking the jobs and the tax revenue"". 

I think it is the constant pressure of this globalization with unemployment that keeps social democracy down. Suddenly we realized we cannot really fight capitalists hard because then they just leave.

Again this to me is obvious. But maybe there is something obvious I don't see?

TV isn't up to date anymore, especially with more and more young- to middleaged people being able to understand english ""perfectly"" and simply watching american shows like Game of Thrones, How I met your Mother or Breaking Bad in english.

TV is - as the article stated - getting boring, because you are forced upon a program instead of just making up your own, just like Youtube offers you to do. However I find myself pulled more towards the english-speaking youtubers, like TotalBiscuit because it has more highquality content, and is not targeted at 14 years old. 

To get back to the beginning: We're having this weird ""3-class-entertainment-society"", where teenagers are pulled towards youtube, middle aged people (18-40) are instead watching those costly Hollywood productions and older people, who are generally more technophobe than younger people tend to stick with the TV. 

However, I think it's good to see that Youtube is flourishing in germany, and I'd like to see a raise of the bar when it comes to quality content on german Youtube channels.

Il problema degli enzimi è che, pur essendo catalizzatori eccellenti, sono difficili da caratterizzare e manipolare (la biologia sintetica è appena agli inizi) e quindi fargli fare reazioni esotiche è rognoso; inoltre possono intervenire altri problemi come inibizione da prodotto, competizione con altre vie metaboliche (se si usano cellule e non enzimi liberi) e altro.

The regional assemblies in the East and South have essentially declared for Putin, the new interim government in the west is closely allied with the EU and if there's a sense that is threatened, that will be the point at which NATO forces fortify Kiev and the west along with their own borders. 

You seem to have the ideas of who is backing whom here backwards. Seven million Afghans voted, what, last week for their president and government and rejected the Taliban and their backwards fundamentalism. *Some* Ukrainians hate the Russians, and plenty support them just as much. 

I probably have met some US service personnel, in the same way I know a couple of British Royal Marines, and a German former naval officer, my godfather was a navigator on a British warship in the 80s, and I know someone who was in the Polish army for years before moving to the UK. My point is that Russia's strength, while not enough to knock out the US alone, is more than a match for many countries in NATO. Oh, and both Russia, the US and UK keep one sub at sea armed with nuclear weapons at all times, in addition to nuclear-powered anti-ship and anti-sub boats, so let's not pretend that having one of those off your coast or within range of your capital isn't a weapon of war, regardless of whether it uses nuclear weapons or not, so it's hardly 'bullshit.'

as if it'd be a piece of piss to do so, that Putin would take his lumps and withdraw to Moscow again, he'd probably resign and everything would be back to normal in a couple of years, with Obama and the other NATO leaders able to take the moral high ground, justify keeping NATO funded, expanding the Alliance and whoever knows what else. 

To address your final point, they won't care if a few bullets get fired their way because *that's already happening* right now. If and when this spills over into a wider conflict against a strong enemy, just look at public support for our recent ventures across the world. Iraq was never popular and it only got worse once the insurgency started dealing serious damage to manpower and machinery on the ground.

Funny how in Poland it's tough as ""*at the edge of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth*"", not Russia. Little bit over 200 years ago Ruthenia was south-eastern edge of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. And it's been under control of Poland and Lithuania since 12th century if I'm not mistaken.

&gt; 200 years ago Ukrainians used the term “русини” (rusyny – Ruthenians) to identify themselves. We cannot translate the term “русин” (rusyn – Ruthenian) as “Russian”. It is a big mistake.

It's quite common mistake made in Polish too, but that's because Russia and Ruthenia share the same core. The primary example of that mistake would be that many Poles are thinking that *Pierogi Ruskie* are Russian Pierogi when in fact these are Ruthenian Pierogi.

&gt; The fact that Muscovy (present-day Russia) wasn’t a part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania means that “zemlie Ruskoe” (lands of Ruthenia), means “Lviv region” (in broad sense – “Ukrainian lands that were a part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania”) and therefore has nothing to do with Russia, and, consequently, cannot be translated as “Russian lands”.

It specifically relates to [Ruthenian Voivodeship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruthenian_Voivodeship) which was part of administrative division in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Still though administrative ""Ruthenia"" was only a part of what's considered a [Ruthenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruthenia) in ethnic perspective (most, if not all of which was also a part of the Commonwealth). So... I don't understand what author wanted to say in this whole section other than the fact that Ruthenia existed outside of Muscovy - which is nothing surprising, quick search in Wikipedia could tell you that without invoking some centuries-old documents ;).",0,1397482863,null,0,1397484473,0,cgs29mv,t3_23024z,t1_cgs29mv,t3_23024z,null,1433348642,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Interesting quotes:

On the primary surplus:

&gt; For the first time since the crisis Greece is in a position to default. It has a primary budget surplus – before interest payments. The European Commission has forecast the primary surplus to reach 2.7 per cent of gross domestic product this year, rising to 4.1 per cent in 2015. The Greek current account registered a first surplus. Greece is no longer dependent on foreign investors.

On the collapse of the Greek economy:

&gt; More shocking than those relative changes are statistics that put the data in perspective. Yanis Varoufakis, a Greek political economist, recently produced a long list, of which I found the following most striking: of 2.8m Greek households, 2.3m have tax debts they cannot service; pensions are the main source of income for 48.6 per cent of families; and 3.5m employed people have to support 4.7m unemployed or inactive people. The Greek economy is not in recession. Nor is it recovering. It has collapsed.

On choice:

&gt; I am not advocating exit. Greek voters and foreign investors should however know that Greece is now in a position where there is a choice.",0,1397482961,null,0,false,0,cgs2au6,t3_2303kr,t1_cgs2au6,t3_2303kr,null,1433348658,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The source is that PDF survey : http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/2014%20April%205%20IRI%20Public%20Opinion%20Survey%20of%20Ukraine,%20March%2014-26,%202014.pdf

But then the russians paid astro turfers to spread a lie that most of eastern ukraine support them and people started to believe it. Including you apparently. Well done.

&gt; The regional assemblies in the East and South have essentially declared for Putin

Because the russians spent about a billion bribing local authorities and them some more to bribe cops. And basically removed anyone opposing theyr power by sending henchmen and hospitalize them, like they did with the police captain in Horlivka.

&gt;  and if there's a sense that is threatened, that will be the point at which NATO forces fortify Kiev and the west along with their own borders. 

Didn't washington basically sent direct orders to the nato commanding officers not to act under any circumstances since the russian invasion begun 2 days ago ? Way to support your allies.

&gt; Some Ukrainians hate the Russians, and plenty support them just as much. 

Some != 80% against russian invasion.

&gt; is more than a match for many countries in NATO.

For individual countries ? yes. For an entire combined nato army ? They'd get slaughtered.

&gt; , that Putin would take his lumps and withdraw to Moscow again

Well if he runs out of troops and attack armies he WOULD HAVE to retreat on his russian positions. We just have not to make the stupid call and avoid pushing in russia itself to avoid cornering him.

&gt; he'd probably resign and everything would be back to normal in a couple of years

Quite frankly if the russians worship putin that much let them have it. But he should gtfo out of europe; whether EU or not.

&gt; To address your final point, they won't care if a few bullets get fired their way because that's already happening right now.

Most of the UA Army surrendered when they learnt NATO would'nt help them. 10 casualties != real firing.

&gt; How long do you really think it would be for the public to turn against a war with Russia watching repatriation after repatriation of bodies of military personnel, and Russian troops getting some well-publicised successes, before they start thinking that maybe they should sue for peace? 

See NATO hadn't the habit of executing on the spot or disappearing and publickly hanging anyone's entire family suspected of vaguely befriending somebody loosely linked to insurgents.

It's more complicated. [According to Wikipedia](http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraina#Etymologia): ""Ukraina"" derives from ""kraj"" or ""the part (of the land)"", and only some say it derives from ""u kraja"" or ""at the edge"".

&gt;It's quite common mistake made in Polish too, but that's because Russia and Ruthenia share the same core. The primary example of that mistake would be that many Poles are thinking that Pierogi Ruskie are Russian Pierogi when in fact these are Ruthenian Pierogi.

First you are right that USA/EU is 1-2 generations ahead of nearly every major MIlitary technology, most importantly FIghter Jets and Drones

You are Wrong  in one aspect

The russians figured out they were 1-2 generations behind in Jet Technology in the 80's/90's(they are not delusional) 

Instead of trying to play catch up, which is impossible they decided to focus their entire military technology effort into a Counter-Balance of USA's Jet Technology which is why Russians have the best Anti-Air Missile technology on Earth, easily 1-2 generations ahead of USA.

The S-300 PMU2(upgraded S-300) is considered vastly superior than the new Patriot Systems. 

The S-400 is the ultimate Stealth Jet killer and Anti-Ballistic Nuke Killer, easily 2 generations ahead of anything USA has

France and UK and Netherlands have colonial history. Germany and Austria got cheap labour from Turkey. Austria also has a historical connection to parts of Yugoslavia. In most cases they're not waves but more like settled down lakes of immigration.

Two issues are being conflated that shouldn't be. Future immigration policy and problems with (in some cases former) immigrants and their offspring. That's a pretty good way of distinguishing a populist right-winger looking to sow conflict versus someone actually concerned with the issue.

When I read about people's bad experience with foreigners on reddit it's about banlieues, no-go areas and foreign-looking teenagers. You don't do anything against that by campaigning against immigration now. The people complained about are already there.

The reason for this charade is that to the far-right-wingers it's not about solving a problem. It's about antagonising one group of people because they despise them for their ethnicity.

I think this was a good response and in and of itself not showing a bad approach. Basically the left and liberal side of Hungarian politics, as you probably know it, basically glorifies the West and Western institutions and loves to represent Fidesz or the right as Anti-Western basically some kind of a weird Asian type of Belorussian un-enlightened dictators and Borat type rednecks. And when it comes to parliamentary democracy, it is fairly clear that the UK is pretty much its birthplace and the Westernestestest possible system. So it is fair to point out that it is even less representative than the Fidesz-made election system. It is a good reminder for the Left and everybody to try to think more substantially than Western / Anti-Western. This does not really say much about an approach to power itself.

But hey, your whole review is not 100% objective or centrist but clearly left-leaning - it would better to conduct such a review from the objective angle. For example you left out from that eco-farm issue that Fidesz supporters were opposed to that farm, because they claimed it produced organic food to be entirely exported to Denmark and also the profits stayed mostly in Denmark - the whole reason why they wanted to stop renting publicly owned land to that farm is that basically they claimed Hungary  has no profit from it whatsoever, neither the food nor the money not even knowledge, so there was no reason to why let them rent public owned land.",0,1397491001,null,0,false,0,cgs5q7z,t3_22wx8w,t1_cgs5q7z,t1_cgr7joe,null,1433350274,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

They are not supposed to be the mindless voting robots of a party. The Purple Party representative of Bumfuckville should be much more a representative of Bumfuckville than of the Purple Party. **He should be more loyal to his district than his party.** This is what your ""individual candidates only"" system tries to do. The ""party lists"" system of e.g. Germany basically makes sure ""party list"" politicians are **loyal to their party and not the people**.

This sucks. This means they are just voting machines. There is no point in democracy if MY representative is not loyal to ME first and foremost but to a party elite.

Suppose you have 200 seats and 100 are filled on party lists. The Purple Party has 25% popularity. Means 25 seats in the party lists are guaranteed. So if you can suck up enough in the Purple Party leadership to put you 10th on the list your seat is guaranteed and there is not a thing a voter can do about it, except to not vote for the WHOLE Purple Party. So if the Purple Party is the largest opposition, and people dislike the government, they basically must vote on you no matter what. They cannot personally not vote for a bad candidate. Will be such a politician a representative of the people? Or just the Purple Party leadership?

The opinion polls are tricky to compare between countries.

Mia opinione strettamente personale, da adulto che è tornato a scuola dopo anni di lavoro: il 60% dei problemi dell'Italia può essere ricondotto ad un'istruzione primaria e secondaria a dir poco scadente. 

Inculcare a forza informazioni (dalla vita breve) agli studenti non serve a niente se questi non sanno come utilizzarle queste informazioni. 

Andate a vedere il programma di una qualunque scuola superiore italiana: se (tutti) i diplomati che escono da queste scuole avessero veramente la capacità di applicare anche solo metà delle conoscenze previste, la nostra economia non potrebbe conoscere crisi.

Il problema è che a buona parte degli insegnanti non interessa fare il proprio lavoro come si deve, anche per colpa dello stato che non incentiva per niente il buon insegnamento, anzi. E quando gli studenti non capiscono qualcosa, ""è colpa loro"". Se un'intera classe di 20 studenti non riesce a capire esclusivamente una, due o tre materie, vuol dire che è una classe di minorati mentali? O forse l'insegnante non sa insegnare? Ed è veramente deprimente vedere gli insegnanti a cui invece importa distruggersi per rimediare alle cazzate dei ""colleghi"".

E' una situazione in cui la mediocrità si autoalimenta e si concentra, stiamo diventando un distillato di mediocrità. Quante volte vi capita di vedere un lavoro fatto veramente in maniera professionale, da persone capaci e responsabili? A me poco spesso.

Sono convinto che quei pochi straordinari individui che periodicamente il nostro paese partorisce sono quello che sono solo perché si sono temprati in anni di lotte per fuggire a questa palude di mediocrità che è tutto intorno a noi.

Per me sarebbe importante creare una struttura di ""ri-formazione"" per persone adulte, perché molta gente non è stupida o meschina per natura, ci diventa per colpa dell'ambiente che li circonda, e l'istruzione è l'arma migliore per combattere questo male.

Really? I'm not sure which state you're in but by far, the most obstructive people in the country are Republican state governors and legislators. Even with the Repubs in Congress simply being downright obstructionist, you don't see them proposing legislation forcing women to have an ultrasound to get an abortion, or make the Bible the official state book, or provide textbook contracts to Christian creationist publishers like Bob Jones University Press, or actually failing to implement health insurance marketplaces, or screaming bloody murder about federal payouts to states for Medicare and Medicaid since it's a ""liberal poor entitlement"", and then take huge amounts of FEMA money in the same breath because people marauding in the streets tends to be bad for PR, or almost completely gutting the rights of public and private workers to form unions, or completely eliminating democratically-elected municipal governments and turning over control of entire metropolitan areas to appointed 'budget experts' who then close nearly half of all schools, or who make it legal to execute stops and seizures if one is suspected of being an illegal migrant, or shredding all state government publications (such as info on obtaining driving licences and complying with state income tax) if it's not published in English, or completely eliminating the state's Department of Community Affairs and all land-use planning legislation, allowing developers to run rampant all over the state and leaving the only line of defence to municipalities, most of whom can't afford to be choosy about which developments they permit, or allowing a new Catholic city that bans pornography to be built in the middle of a wildlife reserve for critically endangered animals, or compelling county governments to pass legislation making it a requirement for residents to bear arms (a local story in Atlanta, admittedly), or making drug tests mandatory in order to receive WIC benefits, even though instances of drug use are extremely small amongst recipients and the testing would cost nearly 10 times more than the amount that would otherwise be likely spent on drugs, and then make sure that the Governor's wife is named as the director of the drug testing firm who provides the service (the governor himself having been convicted of the largest case of healthcare fraud in US history *before* he won the election), and on and on it goes...

Battons notre coulpe, car la liste de nos crimes est longue ! Nous avons pressuré les colonies pour nourrir notre prospérité, les laissant exsangues à l'heure de leur indépendance; nous avons fait venir les ""indigènes"" au lendemain des deux guerres mondiales pour reconstruire la France, quitte à les sommer de s'en aller quand nous n'avions plus besoin d'eux; surtout, nous avons bâti cet empire colonial dans le sang et les larmes, puisque la colonisation a été rien moins qu'une entreprise de génocide : Jules Ferry, c'était, déjà, Hitler !.

Pas pour se faire le chantre de la colonisation, mais pour en finir avec la repentance, avant qu'elle transforme notre Histoire en un album bien commode à feuilleter, où s'affrontent les gentils et les méchants

Les cinq péchés capitaux des faux historiens


Daniel Lefeuvre recense cinq fautes méthodologiques majeures chez les «Repentants» et les prétendus historiens qui torturent le passé pour l'asservir à leurs présupposés idéologiques :


* l'absence de recul critique dans la reprise de citations isolées : le propos d'un excentrique ne reflète pas nécessairement l'état d'esprit de l'opinion publique,
* l'anachronisme : on assimile les faits de guerre pendant la conquête de l'Algérie à des crimes nazis sans voir qu'ils sont tout simplement de même nature que d'autres faits de guerre commis à la même époque et en d'autres lieux, y compris en Europe,
* la généralisation abusive : sur la base de quatre «enfumades» identifiées, on imagine que ce type d'action était banal pendant la conquête de l'Algérie, 
* l'absence de comparaison : on déplore la condition déplorable des immigrés algériens en France après la Seconde Guerre mondiale sans voir qu'elle était en tous points semblable à celle des autres immigrants et de beaucoup de Français pauvres,
* la censure : on fait sciemment silence sur tous les faits qui pourraient contredire la thèse dominante ; ainsi attribue-t-on à la conquête la diminution de la population algérienne entre 1830 et 1870 sans parler de la crise frumentaire très grave qui a sévi en Algérie et au Maroc en 1865-1868.",0,1397491642,null,0,1397491841,0,cgs61c6,t3_22yh1a,t1_cgs61c6,t1_cgs5dxk,null,1433350418,4,false,Politique,t5_2sppv,4

This is already a thing.

I have an understanding of how immensely complex the issue is, that's why I say there is little that can be done, that isn't already being done, to stem the flood of illegal immigrants in the south. Under the UN convention on refugees, if any of them get to Italian, or Spanish, or whatever soil and claim asylum, by **law** they are allowed to stay until their asylum claim is processed, so immediate deportation is both illegal, and immoral. In many places, fines for businesses using illegal labour are already in place.

Are you kidding me? The unification of Italy was basically an annexation of everything by the Savoia. Every part of Italy was united with invasion force or rebellions. Italy was united by invasion troops. Garibaldi and his 1000 man took down the Reign of two Sicilies and won at Volturno? Please. The people supported and joined them.

Saying the South was anywhere near the North in development is outright stupid.

I'm not being prejudiced. I'm checking the facts. Is the North more developed? Yeah. Is there more corruption and mafia in the South? Yeah.

And you know what all I'm saying is? I'm not saying Southerners are stupid or lazy. I'm not generalizing at all. I'm saying: Stop blaming other people for your own fails.

I don't think inequality in the UK is actually that different from most of Europe. 

In my view Farage's popularity isn't really to do with ""social class"" or ""cultural difference"", it is more that he appears to be a political outsider, speak plainly, have a sense of humour, be at home with a pint in the pub, be a bit of a ""cheeky chappie"" and have a genuine political ideology. Clegg, Cameron and Miliband all seem the opposite of this, they represent the political class.

&gt; Also, if this vote reflects this class divide, what will happen in the next national elections?Could UKIP make it there too?

The most likely outcome is that UKIP get zero seats or perhaps a handful of seats at the most. The political landscape in Britain changes very very slowly compared to Italy.

Check the last list: OECD countries after taxes and transfers. UK is second worse in Europe, after Portugal.

For what is worth, I perceive a huge cultural divide between the higher educated, rich people who would never base their opinion on a tabloid, and all the rest. Then there's the case of social benefits, huge neighbourhoods/ghetto where 3 generations are surviving without a job, and so on.

Still, I can be wrong, but the income inequality is there.

It is more than 150 years since anyone has been in power in Britain other than the Conservatives, Labour or the Liberals.

Yes, but if it is the man of the streets Farage appeals to, and the man of the street distrusts Tories and Labour....there are more men of the street than others. Couldn't UKIP get the numbers then?Or are people only voting them for their stance on Europe, and they like nothing else?

Someone suggested orujo below this, try it but i wouldn't recommend everyone getting a glass, unless you appreciate strong liquors because it's very strong. It would be best to get one and share sips with friends. 

If this is the first time in Spain be aware that sodas at restaurants come in glass bottles and aren't refillable, so don't drink it too fast unless you want to run up a check. I'd definitely try tinto del verano, which is usually a house red wine with either gas water or lemon fanta. Very good and less sweet than sangria.  Sangria is usually a red wine with fruit and juice, sugar, and some rum which is why it's such a dangerously fun drink. Although my favorite way to consume wine other than directly from the bottle with a bendy straw is calimocho. Calimocho is the best way to botellon (drinking in the streets/park ). Grab 2 boxes of red wine (less than a euro each - the cheapest the better) and a 2 liter bottle of coke (don't skip out on the coke, the imitations just aren't as good.) and then just mix it all together. I prefer to do 3 parts wine to 1 part coke so I can get drunker faster and with less potty breaks, but there is no direct science. Great way to get your buzz going before going out to clubs for shots and to spend a fortune on drinks. 

Electronics are generally more expensive in Spain than the US, but if you forget something it's not that big of a deal. Don't forget they use a different style plug with a different voltage. Most US appliaces like phone and laptop chargers can accept both (read the plugs, it will say input 120-240v, 120 being US and 240 be EU), so you can get away with a cheap adapter that just changes the shape. They do make big boxes that actually convert the voltage which are more expansive and only necessary for things that won't accept both.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt; This really made me convinced that Schulz must be that kind of aggressive, intolerant, impatient ""culture warrior"" that is thankfully fairly rare in the EU

Oh, he is.     
A complete $h!t.  

He's everything you say.  A bully.  Bombastic.  An egotist.  He rides roughshod over rules as if they don't apply to him.  He argues that Hobsbawm heavily influenced and inspired him.  Hobsbawm was an out and out communist that openly served as an apologist for Stalin and even argued for when ethnic cleansing could be justified.

When I say I want President Schulz and that he'd be good at the job I have a slightly different intent.  I want the UK to leave the EU.  A couple of years of Schulz at the helm will give UKIP another ten points in the polls and make a referendum outcome a certainty.

The affiliated Labour party in the UK has even requested that Schulz keep a low UK profile in the run up to the European elections.  They know his personality and political message is toxic in the UK.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"&gt;You chose again to not see the problem. Lack of assimilation is a real problem, and it does worsen the quality of life for the existing populace. Again the numbers of the supporters do not swell for no reason.

You claimed that a large percentage of a country being born overseas was a problem, you didn't mention assimilation. So again, how is a high percentage of foreign born citizens in a country a problem?

&gt;That is not what was being discussed. What was being discussed was support for the parties that are attempting to change immigration policies. Extremists exist in all spectres of political arena. If we use them as a basis for discussion we have a problem.

As I said, I identified two predominant strands of the immigration debate in Europe. I then said that for the southern strain, that which has a problem with 'boat people', there are no humane, ethical, moral, or legal solutions that aren't pretty much already in place.

&gt;UN convention on refugees was made by man and should be changed by man. We also had laws on women's ability to vote and gay rights but we changed them because there was no room for them in our society. Societies change, laws must change with it. The law should allow only for legal migration and immediate deportation of everyone else. The laws you mentioned on fines, might exist but are seldomly enforced. A law without enforcement is worthless. If it was enforced 100% of the time, there would be no questioning its efficency.

Look, the world is not going to change the convention just because Italy, or Spain, or what-have-you is having trouble with boat arrivals. Meaning there are two choices, abandon the convention - thus removing yourself from the list of respectable nations - or keep it, and accept that this is just an unsolvable problem. I also see no point in setting up a large scale task force to deal with people employing illegal immigrants if it's going to cost the state considerably more than the problems the illegal immigration causes. 

&gt;I was certain I saw it in your post. If you did not eddit your post to remove it, then my apologies. It is brought up multiple times in this thread, it must have stuck with me.

I'm no expert, but from reading articles on the internet, I've been given the impression that Russian fighter jets are vastly superior to their European counterparts. And they're also developing a fifth generation fighter that's fairly close to mass production. Nobody in western Europe is doing that. (Turkey mights be, but they're far from having a finished product.) 

The concept of supermanoeuvrability was pretty much pioneered by the Russians, and at the end of the cold war their targeting systems were better than the ones fitted on NATO jets. (This is judging from reports by the Germans, when they were unified and got the DDR's fighters.)  I don't know about today, because targeting systems aren't a part of red flag exercises and it's hard for me to compare them. But their aircraft are definitely more manoeuvrable. 

Their air defence systems appear to be better, as well. Judging by data I've found on the internet.

Aftonbladet is one of the major newspapers in Sweden. They're pretty trash in my opinion but they are, since they are so mainstream, very careful not to publish articles that can get them sued for slander.

I'll translate the beginning of the article for you unless you can find a already translated version:



&gt;Carl Bildt (M) informed USA about what was said during closed government sessions in the 70's.

Former Prime Minister Thorbjörn Fälldin and the former partyleader of Folkpartiet didn't know anything about Bildts contacts.

– Everything we said was secret. Not only to foreign interests, but also to our own parties, said Per Ahlmark (FP).

– If you've agreed not to release this to the public then that is what applies, said Thorbjörn Fälldin (C).

The government negotiations in Riksdagshuset in Stockholm, the autumn of 1976, happened in great secrecy. 

Eleven days after the election, october 1st, Thorbjörn Fälldin made this comment about the longdrawn negotiations in Aftonbladet.

– I'm not disclosing anything about the negotiations, said the leader of the Centerpartiet.

But on the same day the american ambassador David S Smith writes a secret report to the secretary of state Henry Kissinger. He refers to a meeting between the then 27 year old Carl Bild, the leader of the Moderate party Gösta Bohmans assistant and future son-in-law and the USAs representative on location Ronald E Woods.

Before the Swedish people


Bildt had then, in exchange for not being revealed as the source, accounted for what had been said during the secret negotiations. It explicitily says in the diplomatic reports, which has been leaked through Wikileaks, that the information was turned over in confidence by a ""source close to the negotiations"".

Carl Bildt had among other things disclosed how the upcoming three party coalition would be configured, how the political parties reasoned around the nuclear power issue and how they would deal with a general election. 

Information that reached the american government far before it reached the Swedish people. The information was also considered important enough to pass along to the CIA, according to the documents.

Ronald E Woods, who met Bildt during this time, remembers well his contact in Sweden.

– I remember meeting Carl Bildt, he was very wellread and well informed. I reported everything he said, it was my job, he says.

Both Thorbjörn Fälldin (C) and Per Ahlmark (FP) remember that Carl Bildt sat in during the negotiations in the riksdagshuset. 

They were both clear about how secret the meeting was.

End of my translation of the article.


This was just about half the article, I don't have the patience to translate all of it straight off. I don't think it proves that Carl Bildt is still a CIA informant but he almost certainly was at one point.

So lets see, The Falklands population voted 99% in favour of being British.

Before the Argentinian invasion the UK was involved in negotiations to give the Islands to Argentina however they took the position that the Islanders had to agree to it, therefore a policy of allowing Argentina to try and convince the Islanders was taken.

The military dictatorship of Argentina invaded the Falklands voiding any claim the Argentinians might have to the Falklands.

The Argentinian claim to the Falklands is weaker than the UK's anyway, even if we ignore the British population that has lived there for hundreds of years. 

infact the only Argentinian settlement ever on the Falklands was destroyed by the USS Lexington in the infamous Lexington raid.

Any Argentinian claim to the Falklands is over the head of the principle of Self determination.

There is nothing to negotiate, self determination rules high.

The US's neutrality in the Falklands conflict in favour of Argentina (a 3rd world dictatorship) was a betrayal of the UK.

And Hilary Clinton's neutrality in Argentina's favour in regards to negotiations is also a betrayal.

Thanks. I've seen other studies (with other methodologies) saying different things, but I take your point.

&gt; For what is worth, I perceive a huge cultural divide between the higher educated, rich people who would never base their opinion on a tabloid, and all the rest. Then there's the case of social benefits, huge neighbourhoods/ghetto where 3 generations are surviving without a job, and so on.

There is a cultural divide (typified by tabloids versus broadsheets) and Britain does have a strong (though hard to explain) class system.

However, people don't really vote along class lines. And while a lot of the tabloids are broadly EUsceptic (Mail, Express, Sun), others are very pro-EU (Mirror, Star) and of the broadsheets some are pro-EU (Guardian, Independent, Financial Times) but others are very sypathetic to Farage/EUsceptic (Telegraph, Times).

Also, the people that Farage tries to speak most directly to, are not those on social benefits. Farage's main voice goes to the so called ""working poor"", upper working class or lower middle class types. It is these people, in the middle of the British class system, that are the key constituency. They won elections for Thatcher and won elections for Blair. 

&gt; Yes, but if it is the man of the streets Farage appeals to, and the man of the street distrusts Tories and Labour....there are more men of the street than others. Couldn't UKIP get the numbers then?Or are people only voting them for their stance on Europe, and they like nothing else?

We will see. First past the post is a very unforgiving system to new-comers and smaller parties. At the last general election UKIP got 3% of the vote. Even if UKIP get 18% of the vote in the general election in 2015, an improvement that is unheard of in a few hundred years of British electoral history, they will end up with zero seats.

No, they wouldn't since they'd end up in court and stand to lose a great deal of prestige and money due to that. I pretty much despise Aftonbladet but they won't publish something this significant about a politican without some kind of proof to back it up. 

Anyway more links about the same story on other major publications in Sweden:

1. Basically yes. Still, Munich is probably the southernmost of the major cities in Germany. I know that Americans are used to traveling great distances, but you should keep in mind that a trip from Munich to Hamburg would be about 500 miles. Depending on how long you will stay, I would recommend traveling to southern cities like Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Karlsruhe, Nürnberg etc.

2. That really depends on what you like. There's so much to discover. I'll try to give some examples.
 If you like medieval towns that are still intact, you could go to Mainz, Heidelberg, Würzburg, or Rothenburg ob der Tauber. (Find more here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altstadt).
The Rhine river is great to travel along: It has been praised by German poets like Goethe because there are lots of castles and romantic villages close to it, but also big metropolises. Look for the ""Loreley"", the ""Deutsches Eck"" near Koblenz, and of course cities like Cologne, Bonn, or Mainz.  
Frankfurt is famous for its financial districts with many skyscrapers. Some people say it's Germany's most American city.
The Ruhr Area (Ruhrgebiet) in Western Germany might be interesting, too: It has a big tradition of mining and industry.
Leipzig (Eastern Germany) is considered the ""new Berlin"". It used to be pretty lame, but now there are artists and students making it cool again. (So I've heard.)

3. and 
4. I can't think of anything special. But avoid restaurants that are too close to the most famous sights. They are horribly expensive and not that good, but I guess that's not just a German thing.

6. If you're 16, you're allowed to drink beer and wine. If you're 18, you may drink any alcohol you like. Nevertheless, there are _some_ bars or casinos that have higher age limits. I have never tried to get my own cocktail mixed, but I think it should not be a problem if you're at a good cocktail bar. You could check out some bars via yelp.com or foursquare.

7. The ""thumbs up"" thing must be a mistake. No one takes offense if you do it. The middle finger is considered extremely rude, just like in the US. Also, you should avoid doing this: http://hispanoteca.eu/Lengua/Gestos%20y%20ademanes/tornillo-2.jpg
It means: ""You're crazy!""

8. I think it depends on who you're talking to. Most young people are totally ok with it, there are even Hitler parodies on TV. However, some people might not realize you're joking because of their poor image of the American education. Some of my friends who traveled to the US told me how they were seriously asked by people if Hitler was still running the country. There may also be people who are fed up with the Hitler jokes, I guess.

Berlin, Hamburg, Köln…), you're looking at something like a 6hr train ride in each direction. if you want to spend a day in Berlin, that'll basically take three days of your trip, once you account for travel time.

given where Munich is, you might want to think about visiting some towns in Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic. They're all Schengen zone so you shouldn't have any trouble at the borders.

They then interviewed the American representative in Sweden at that time who confirmed that Carl Bildt did give him information and that he did pass that information along back to a foreign power.

- with 18 you'll be able to drink/buy/attend anything that's legal for adults (some bars allow nobody under 21 but that is their own choice then and has nothing to do with the german laws)
- Dresden is a beautiful town with a lot of history. Most of it is in the inner city so there's a lot to see just by walking through the city.
- Nuremberg also has a lot of history, but it's more spread out, so you'll have to use public transport to get to the different interesting places. (You'll be confused by their subway as it operates automatically without any drivers)
- While not in Germany, definitely go to Prague while you're in europe, one of the most beautiful towns in the world.
- don't make hitler jokes unless they're incredibly good. Also Don't make them to anyone you just met. If you make friends over there it might be ok after some days, but if you make them to someone you just met they'll probably hate you.

En faite ça s'appelle ""Provocation publique à la discrimination, à la haine ou à la violence nationale"", abrégé racisme anti-français.

&gt;Le racisme se base sur l'idée mal fondée de ""races"" d'humain

On veut faire disparaître le mot race car il a donné lieu aux idéologies racistes mais il y a bien une différence pertinente entre [certains groupes](http://lemondeactuel.angelfire.com/article/lesraceshumaines/Parente_genetique_des_races_humaines.png). Après si on ne veut pas appeler ça des races on peut appeler ça autrement, ce n'est qu'une guerre semantic.

&gt;De même que la haine envers les juifs s'appelle anti-sémitisme et non racisme, car être juif signifie adhérer à une religion, et non appartenir à une race

Que d'erreurs.

Déjà les Sémites c'est les peuple du Moyen Orient à la base, juifs et arabes donc. Le mot antisémitisme ne fait donc pas allusion à une religion mais bien à l'appartenance à un peuple/race/ethnie. C'est son utilisation qui a dérivée. Encore une guerre sémantique, on devrait dire racisme pour tout le monde.

&gt;car être juif signifie adhérer à une religion

Non, juif n'est pas seulement une religion c'est la seul religion monothéiste qui intègre le concept de race(ou appelle ça comme tu veut). N'importe qui ne peut pas se convertir au judaïsme. La judéité se transmet par la mère, tu ne peut pas être juif si ton père est juif mais ta mère est chrétienne par exemple. De plus si tu ne pratique pas tu es mis au banc de la communauté mais tu continue à être juif car juif n'est pas une pratique religieuse mais un droit de naissance. Le judaïsme est donc une race complétée d'un culte.


&gt;On ne peut pas parler non plus de xénophobie

We will be renting out an apartment in Munich for the duration of our stay, but we will be able to go just about anywhere in the country that we want (right?). What should we definitely do in Germany? Are there any must-see sights like the Brandenburg Gatge?

Munich and Bavaria is one huge tourist magnet, everyone goes there. And the problem with this is: Bavaria is not like Germany at all. They don't even speak proper German (I can't understand their dialect). So you need to see things that are not in Southern Germany! Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg are modern towns that are worth a visit. If you want to see old stuff visit Dresden, Nuremberg and the like. How many days will you stay in Germany? How do you plan to travel? Renting a car? Driving from Munich to Hamburg will take 7 hours at least. So if you want to drive back on the same day it's not really worth it.

&gt; How can we go about avoiding enormous costs?

Don't live in Munich. Really. Munich is a very expensive city.

&gt; How should I go about not upsetting anybody? I have heard that the ""thumbs up"" is a very rude gesture in Germany, similar to the American ""middle finger"". Are there any other things like this?

I've never heard about the thumbs up thing. And I'm German. I can't think of any gesture that would upset people.

&gt;Ogni atto od omissione illecita da parte della Potenza detentrice che provochi la morte o metta gravemente in pericolo la salute di un prigioniero di guerra in suo potere è proibito e sarà considerato come una infrazione grave alla presente Convenzione. In particolare, nessun prigioniero di guerra potrà essere sottoposto ad una mutilazione fisica o ad un esperimento medico o scientifico di qualsiasi natura, che non sia giustificato dalla cura medica del prigioniero interessato e che non sia nel suo interesse.

&gt;I prigionieri di guerra devono parimenti essere sempre protetti specialmente contro gli atti di violenza o d'intimidazione, contro gli insulti e pubblica curiosità.

&gt;Le misure di rappresaglia nei loro confronti sono proibite.

true,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"1. Munich isn't the most central place from which to explore Germany. You don't say when or for how long you'll be in Germany, or how you intend to travel, but Munich is way down in the south east.
2. The Brandenburg Gate is in Berlin, which is close to a day's drive or a day's train ride, for example. Most of Bavaria should be within easy reach, though. The Alps are pretty close: Garmisch-Partenkirchen is the main ski resort nearby but there's less going on out of season; the Zugspitze on the Austrian border in Germany's highest mountain; the area has many, many castles, the most famous being Neuschwanstein. Further afield there's Nuremberg, the Black Forest, Heidelberg, Rothenburg ob der Tauber...
3. It depends on the tourists. Of course, the touristy places can be overpriced and crowded, but that may or may not bother you. You could easily just go off the beaten track and drive through the countryside: there are all sorts of places that are just wonderful but haven't been invaded by the tourists.
4. Not really. Beware of pickpockets and don't keep your valuables in your back pocket. Be wary of overly helpful people. In many cities, you'll see people apparently winning money on guessing games but that's a scam. Many things are put on for the tourists, like all those thigh-slapping dances with girls in dirndls and men in lederhosen: almost certainly not authentic at all. You may not mind that, though, as it's sort of based on real Bavarian culture. Sort of.
5. Go off the beaten track. This is difficult when you don't know what to look out for; you may find a wonderful country pub that does fantastic food in massive portions for chump change, but it could just as easy be a horrible dive that smells of stale beer.
6. Beer and unfortified wine is legal at 16, everything else is spirits. If you're 18, this won't be that important to you. There are cocktail bars, especially in a modern city like Munich, but bear in mind that your brother won't be allowed in such places.
7. I don't know where you heard that about the ""thumbs up"" sign, because it means exactly the same in Germany as it does in the US (otherwise Facebook wouldn't work). I think somebody might have been kidding you. Germans are usually less tactile (not so much hugging, but a lot of handshaking), and are suspicious of too much patriotism: tell Germans how physically beautiful your country is, but don't try to tell them that it is the best country in the world. You may feel that Germans are staring at you all the time: this is simply because they maintain eye contact for very slightly longer than Americans are usually comfortable with. Germans also prefer honesty over politeness, so don't be offended if they're a bit direct: they're genuinely trying to be helpful.
8. For a foreigner: about eleven. Germans have only just started making Hitler jokes themselves: give them time.
9. In restaurants, don't wait to be seated unless there is actually a sign telling you to wait: just choose a table to your liking and sit down. You'll get the menu fairly quickly and asked if you want to order drinks right away (note: there is no such thing as the bottomless cup in Germany). Once you have ordered your meal, you'll usually be left alone unless you beckon your server over. You'll usually get the side salad before everything else: you can eat it as a starter or wait for the main course. After you've finished and the server has taken your plates away, you won't be asked to pay immediately. Instead, you ask for the bill when you're ready for it. When the server eventually arrives with the bill, you'll be asked if you're paying together (""zusammen"") or separately (""getrennt""). If you pay separately, each person says what they are paying for and the server adds up what they owe. Cash is always, always preferred. The usual tip is between 5% and 10% and is genuinely discretionary: it is never automatically added to the bill. It works like this: the server tells you how much you need to pay, you mentally add about 10% and round it to the nearest convenient figure, hand over your money and announce how much you're paying (or say ""stimmt so"" to mean ""keep the change"") and the server thanks you and gives you the appropriate change. If you're in a place that's not used to tourists, don't leave the tip on the table when you leave: they'll chase after you and give it back.",0,1397498234,null,0,false,0,cgs9b85,t3_230lg4,t1_cgs9b85,t3_230lg4,null,1433351977,20,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,20

&gt; The troika weren't just going to give money away forever, they needed to make sure the Greek state could stand on it's own two feet and so they attached conditions they thought would help speed that along, but which were also acceptable to the constituent members of the troika.

As a matter of fact they're already doing it (by pushing maturities half century into the future) and they'll continue to do it, since they've completely impaired Greece's ability to dig itself out of the pit. 

&gt; No matter what, putting the blame on 'European policy makers' is the wrong thing to do - the cause of the crisis was mismanagement by Greece.

Again, this is not Greece' exclusive, policymakers decided that we need correction, this manifested in many ways, one of them being people forced into servitude or simply falling off the grid. Unlike European policymakers, IMF publicly acknowledged these… ''miscalculations''.

true,globaltyler,GERM,Germany until further notice,"I do moan on a very high level, compared to other developing countries, that is true.

But since I am paying through the nose for that ""service"", I do have the right to moan. It costs ~240 EUR a month to commute by train (+ petrol to get to the train station + parking fees) it is actually nearly the same price as going by car, the only difference is the parking fees in Frankfurt are higher.
In other countries the price for public transport is significantly lower. 

The same pass would only cost 140 EUR in Melbourne as an example and Australia has a higher average income than Germany and the cost of living in general is higher.

In Prague, it is ~18 EUR per month for a monthly pass, which comes to about 2% of the national average gross wage. To put it into perspective, I am paying 7% of the German national average gross wage, more than 3 times as much in relative terms. And the service isn't even half as good.

And you can't play the ""oh it is a highly complex system"" excuse here. The failure in public transport in Germany is systemic. The reason why my Intercity train is always delayed is because the schedule is done by some company in Switzerland who either don't know or don't care that they are using long distance rolling stock for commuter trains. Because in lack of proper commuter trains, that's just what those trains are in my area. So every morning it is standing room only in the narrow hallways of those cars. And of course those single doors aren't really made for so many passengers alighting or boarding the trains, that's where the delay comes from.

And it's not like that happened over night, nope this problem has existed for years, but no one cares for a solution.

Also you cannot say ""it is a highly complex system"" if Deutsche Bahn just doesn't invest in infrastructure because the political will in Germany is that they should create as much revenue as possible to give to the owner (the German government), so that they can patch their budget.

Also, middle school history books are not what I would call my first choice, as they are overly simplified and hardly up to date with the small but numerous and overall vital discoveries that are made; much of the truth on the unification of Italy has been uncovered only recently.

You can't relate the hate of the most violent minority of football teams (who have violent minorities in each and every team of not only Italy but Europe and even the whole world) to that of territorial racism. That side of football is horrible everywhere and from any group f fans of any team at all regardless. Besides, I don't know the details about it (and mind I absolutely don't want to justify anything), but tossing piss bottles can be an act of rivalry of team vs team, but screaming insults based on territorial bias is a territorial rivalry that goes beyond the team vs team one; basically, Juve's fans responded to violence with racism - neither of the two things are right, but that doesn't make Napoli's fans as racist as Juve's showed to be. It's quite childish to dispute on who is more racist than whom; I can't deny there is racism towards the north, but you can't deny there is racism towards the south also, and I care to have you notice that in our parliament we have a party that is essentially based on racism north vs south that has about 5% of the votes, if that's not showing that at least part of the north thinks itself humanly superior than the rest of the country, I don't know what it is.

So basically what you're saying on the unification is this: ""yeah, you're right it was a shit, but what can we do about it? Let's just carry on now."" Well, fucking no. Germany went out of its way to try and make east Germany competitive in order to properly reunite it with the west, after the fall of the Berlin wall, and we're talking about a pair of decades - Italy was united in 1861, how come more than 140 years weren't enough to make southern Italy on par with the rest of Italy?

&gt;There are OECD stats out there somewhere that show that immigrants tend to get worse opportunities than natives, all things being equal. 

You don't need OECD stats for that. It's basic insider-outsider theory and it occurs in all societies regardless of measures. It's why I compared them to EU immigrants.

&gt;There was also a study in Sweden a few years back that found that people with non-native names were considerably less likely to get callbacks and interview for a job. 

Which doesn't explain their massive divide from EU immigrants. 

&gt;Nevertheless, let's not forget that immigrants are also some of the largest starters of SMEs.

Pizzerias aren't a huge benefit to the local economy unfortunately. Particularly not since they're practically incentivized to cheat on their taxes with our weird flour tax that some political animal thought up but still that depends on the immigrants. They've actually made certain ghettos ""New Start Zones"" where they get massive tax cuts for the first 5 years of any business but those areas are still an economic dead-end for the most part. 

I think the statistic that made the issue clear enough was that on average it takes 7 years for immigrants coming here to get their first job. On top of that we have statistics massaging government provided jobs. This includes everything from returning Swedes to neighbouring countries, EU immigrants and non-western ones.

L'esperienza insegna che le persone comprano il quotidiano pur non essendo in grado di capirlo; e quanto a ""valutare le proposte economiche e politiche"", ci sono tanti analfabeti funzionali che dicono di saperlo fare meglio di te, e tanta gente intelligente che ha preferito rinunciare a farlo. Insomma, rivestire l'alfabetismo funzionale con una patina di impegno civile non è solo sbagliato, ma anche fuorviante.

E quel paragrafo viene ovviamente dopo un altro:

&gt; I parametri Invalsi – lo strumento Europeo per la valutazione delle competenze – sono diventati in fretta praticamente l’unica cosa che la scuola si preoccupa di insegnare, riducendo la lungimiranza dell’insegnamento alla verifica in programma, all’esame di fine anno.

&gt; Ma cosa rimane fuori da una scuola sdraiata sui parametri Invalsi (per i quali, in ogni caso, non brilliamo, come competenza, in particolar modo nel Sud Italia)?

Ed eccolo il circlejerk anti-Invalsi. Il punto è che quello che viene effettivamente verificato nei test Invalsi *è proprio quello che discrimina gli analfabeti funzionali dagli alfabeti*.

L'avete mai fatto un test Invalsi? [Eccone un esempio per il liceo [PDF]](http://www.invalsi.it/snv1011/documenti/Esempi_prova_scuola_secondaria_secondo_grado.pdf), non molto dissimile da quello che ho fatto io al biennio. Sono tutte cose che un liceale è tenuto a saper fare: capire un testo, evitare le ambiguità nella scrittura, calcolare qualche semplice probabilità, essere capace di leggere i grafici. No, nulla di questo è nozionismo. È ciò che si richiede a chiunque voglia capire un articolo di giornale o un qualunque libro di saggistica. 

Alla fine, temo, il problema è che non si verifica la capacità di estrapolare, conservare e sintetizzare informazioni dal consumo dei documenti. Possiamo invogliare i ragazzi a leggere libri, ed è un intento nobile, ma questo si limita alla lettura di diletto.

Certi tipi di lettura, totalmente diversi, sono imposti: l'articolo di giornale, il contratto da firmare, la relazione di lavoro, la bolletta della luce, i libri universitari. Essi richiedono un approccio diverso: un'analisi delle informazioni e la loro successiva sintesi. Ma non mi sembra che questo metodo, che richiede molta più attenzione e determinazione della narrativa, venga affrontato sistematicamente nelle scuole nostrane.",0,1397499629,null,0,false,0,cgsa0xi,t3_2302oe,t1_cgsa0xi,t3_2302oe,null,1433352312,11,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,11

Schulz did not accept this separation, at the end of the day saying such views are unacceptable even if they are personal.

So it is down to how you define (socio-cultural) liberalism.

Buttioglione was of the older, broader liberal notion that a liberal state means people of very different values can live together without politically forcing their views on each other.

Schulz is of the more intolerant, impatient notion that traditionalist views are unacceptable even when personal because they COULD be used to oppress others.

Buttiglione was of the older liberalism that says it is possible for gays and Catholics to live in the same state without using politics to oppress each other.

Schulz is of the newer liberalism that basically says traditionalism is never tolerable because its very nature is intolerant.

Refugees are just a part of the problem, but lets start there. Natives per refugee in:

* Sweden: 107

* Norway: 119

* Germany: 154

* Austria: 177

* Netherlands: 222

* Cyprus: 229

* France: 310

* UK: 319

Compare that with: 

* Australia: 1009

* US: 1201

Now on top of that consider that much of these EU countries have extremely generous social policies, at least when compared to the US, which drive the costs upwards. This really puts stress on the system, particularly in a time when the economy isn't fabulous. 

Consider furthermore that some these very generous social policies provide for people who can't find work, and provide for people who have babies. There's people making a living as baby making machines in Sweden. 

&gt; The problems commonly attested to be caused by immigrants being different tend to rather be problems rather caused by poverty and lack of opportunity.

No shit? So maybe we should stop take as many poor people who will struggle with finding opportunities, how about that? 

And while of course that's a big part of the problem, it's disingenuous to pretend culture is not an issue.

They also take a lot of students in the UK. 3rd most represented non-EU country? Nigeria. And 7 and 8? Saudia Arabia and Pakistan. If you think that's low in the list, it's above Canadians. Yes many of the students will have a different mindset from the average Saudi Arabian or Pakistani and fit very well. But with the good plenty of bad also comes (And let me stress I wouldn't suggest that students is where you should cut, as I do believe this emigration can be some of the most productive in the medium/long term).

I always recommend Tino Sanandaiji's explanations since he cites well and values honesty in debate above all.

Mostly their finances. For instance, the state I live in (Illinois) is a blue state. That did not make your shit list, but it's bonds are rated junk status, the interest on those bonds is ever increasing, and underfunded pension funds threaten to turn the state into one big Detroit. Most of the states you listed have no such problems. Also, state taxes in those states are lower which is nice as resident. My state cannot say no to public employee unions, hence as a result funding for everything else is being crowded out...unless taxes are increased to paper over long standing and unaddressed issues.

&gt;Entirely subjective

True. That doesn't need to be an indictment on politics. But a lot of those states have significantly better weather than the elsewhere in the country, so that alone would make someone like me put those states on ""awesome list"", and not a ""shit list"". That is really what I meant by saying they are nicer to live in. It's not too controversial, just an opinion.

Basically, a lot of people on reddit tend to equate a good state with a state that has progressive values. I put some weight into that category, but I wouldn't prioritize social issues over fiscal issues.

As a European the effects propaganda has on Americans is glaring when you interpret a piece promoting ties between China and Europe as anti-American.

Why not look for a youth hostel? They are ok with older folks staying too. When friends of mine visited they stayed here: http://www.aohostels.com/en/muenchen/muenchen-hackerbruecke/

Very basic rooms, maybe you want to get a room on your own (to avoid drunken / strange roommates). Bonus: You will get to know other travellers your age. 

&gt;How can we go about avoiding enormous costs?

- Some cities offer some kind of ""guest pass"", which costs a fee and grants you discounts/free entry on a lot of places (mostly museums).
- A lot of cities have some kind of day pass for their public transport, usually its the best place to move around.
- in Germany, you can drink tap water. Don't drink from fountains though (they are marked ""kein Trinkwasser""/no drinking water for a reason).

&gt;Are there any tourist traps that we should be careful to avoid?

Any ""traditional"" eating place in the city of city popular with tourists will be somewhat overpriced. 

Tips for Munich:

- In a Biergarten, you are allowed to bring your own food (but some tables can be be excluded from that, just ask the staff or locals if you don't understand the signs).
- The Viktualienmarkt is kind of expensive (overpriced IMO)
- Municipal museums (i.e. not BMW world, but e.g. the ""Pinakothek der Moderne"" are 1€ on sundays). Museums will be more crowded than usual Sunday afternoon.

true,Jonisaurus,EURO,European Union,"He is (I suspect deliberately) conflating and misrepresenting issues regarding the EU. He uses many people's lack of knowledge about EU history, politics or how institutions work to gain votes. In pretty populist manner.

I can give you some examples.

**1. Historical Mispresentation**

 He implies that a few 'unelected bureaucrats' turned what was just a trade zone into an anti-democratic, imperialist monster. That's completely wrong. Anyone who reads Schuman, Monnet and other important founding figures can see that European unity, from the very beginning, was about peace and about political unity. Free trade and economic partnership were essential tools to make this reality, but always tools. Never the goal.


**2. Political misrepresentation**

 On the one hand he complains about the national member states losing sovereignty, on the other hand he bemoans a lack of power of the European Parliament. That's a god damn joke. One is the direct consequence of the other. The EU cannot be like a normal democracy for the very reason that some member states do not want that to happen. The European Parliament not being like all other democratic parliaments is a testament to the sovereign nature of EU member states.


**3. Institutional misrepresentation**

 He makes it seem like the EU Commission is a hugely powerful place that rules Europe from a central location. Utter nonsense. The EU Commission has rather little power compared to the European Council and the Council of the European Union. Those two councils are basically the main legislative and strategic bodies of the EU and they are made up the heads of national governments (European Council) who make the big decisions and their ministerial envoys (Council of the EU) who vote on specific legislation and therefore act as the EU's upper chamber.

That's why the European Parliament doesn't have the right of initiative. Because the political power in Europe comes from the national member states and their governments. Especially the big ones like Germany, France, UK (and Italy when it isn't in crisis).

Barroso and van Rompuy don't decide about EU aid to Greece or the size of the EU budget. Merkel, Cameron, Hollande and their colleagues do.

---

A practical example of such a misrepresentation: EU-sceptics like to mention the cucumber curvature regulation as an ideal example of Brussels bureaucrats going mad on power.

It is the exact opposite. It's a perfect example of an EU Commission that concerns itself with little administrative tasks for lack of power to have much influence on the great decisions. All the Commission did was combine different national rules and industrial standards into one EU-wide standard. It was a simplification of rules, not an example of crazy Brussels red tape which is what EU-sceptics made of it. That's what's bizarre about the story.

Meanwhile nothing changed. Normal cucumbers continue to be sold as Class 1, weirdly bent cucumbers are still sold and eaten as Class 2.

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"&gt; Mostly their finances. For instance, the state I live in (Illinois) is a blue state. That did not make your shit list, but it's bonds are rated junk status, the interest on those bonds is ever increasing, and underfunded pension funds threaten to turn the state into one big Detroit.

That's absolutely right and it was a huge oversight for me to leave out Illinois which along with California must be in tough competition for the worst-governed state out there.

&gt; Most of the states you listed have no such problems.

I'm not so sure about that, so I went searching for the most objective list I could find on the subject and came across [this](http://247wallst.com/special-report/2013/11/21/the-best-and-worst-run-states-in-america-a-survey-of-all-50-2/). It's by no means perfect, and they acknowledge that. Oddly enough, the single biggest problem I've got with their methodology is that it seems to weigh financial issues (GDP per capita, budget deficits, tax revenue and unemployment) far more heavily than indicators such as crime, homeless rates, educational rankings, health outcomes and many other things. Of course if it was me, I'd be tempted to include whether or not capital punishment is still used, whether or not that state offers employment discrimination protection for LGBT residents and many other subjective value judgements. 

In any case, for what it's worth, here are the rankings for the states I listed (minus Utah, which really shouldn't have been on there):

* 10. Texas
* 14. Virginia
* 16. Tennessee
* 21. Wisconsin
* 26. Ohio (in parts)
* 29. North Carolina
* 33. Oklahoma
* 34. Georgia
* 35. Michigan
* 36. Mississippi
* 37. Florida
* 38. Kentucky
* 40. Alabama
* 42. South Carolina
* 44. Louisiana
* 45. Arizona
* 46. Nevada
* 49. New Mexico

For what it's worth, they've put Illinois at 48 and California at 50. As you can see, out of the 18 states (excluding Utah) that I initially mentioned, only one is in the top ten, and only four of them are in the top 25, with six of them being in the bottom ten. Like I said, I actually think they've put too much weight on financial indicators, but that's the best source I've found so far. Their methodology is on the [final page](http://247wallst.com/special-report/2013/11/21/the-best-and-worst-run-states-in-america-a-survey-of-all-50-2/7/).

Echevelé, livide au milieu des tempêtes,
Caïn se fut enfui de devant Jéhovah,
Comme le soir tombait, l'homme sombre arriva
Au bas d'une montagne en une grande plaine ;
Sa femme fatiguée et ses fils hors d'haleine
Lui dirent : « Couchons-nous sur la terre, et dormons. »
Caïn, ne dormant pas, songeait au pied des monts.
Ayant levé la tête, au fond des cieux funèbres,
Il vit un oeil, tout grand ouvert dans les ténèbres,
Et qui le regardait dans l'ombre fixement.
« Je suis trop près », dit-il avec un tremblement.
Il réveilla ses fils dormant, sa femme lasse,
Et se remit à fuir sinistre dans l'espace.
Il marcha trente jours, il marcha trente nuits.
Il allait, muet, pâle et frémissant aux bruits,
Furtif, sans regarder derrière lui, sans trêve,
Sans repos, sans sommeil; il atteignit la grève
Des mers dans le pays qui fut depuis Assur.
« Arrêtons-nous, dit-il, car cet asile est sûr.
Restons-y. Nous avons du monde atteint les bornes. »
Et, comme il s'asseyait, il vit dans les cieux mornes
L'oeil à la même place au fond de l'horizon.
Alors il tressaillit en proie au noir frisson.
« Cachez-moi ! » cria-t-il; et, le doigt sur la bouche,
Tous ses fils regardaient trembler l'aïeul farouche.
Caïn dit à Jabel, père de ceux qui vont
Sous des tentes de poil dans le désert profond :
« Etends de ce côté la toile de la tente. »
Et l'on développa la muraille flottante ;
Et, quand on l'eut fixée avec des poids de plomb :
« Vous ne voyez plus rien ? » dit Tsilla, l'enfant blond,
La fille de ses Fils, douce comme l'aurore ;
Et Caïn répondit : « je vois cet oeil encore ! »
Jubal, père de ceux qui passent dans les bourgs
Soufflant dans des clairons et frappant des tambours,
Cria : « je saurai bien construire une barrière. »
Il fit un mur de bronze et mit Caïn derrière.
Et Caïn dit « Cet oeil me regarde toujours! »
Hénoch dit : « Il faut faire une enceinte de tours
Si terrible, que rien ne puisse approcher d'elle.
Bâtissons une ville avec sa citadelle,
Bâtissons une ville, et nous la fermerons. »
Alors Tubalcaïn, père des forgerons,
Construisit une ville énorme et surhumaine.
Pendant qu'il travaillait, ses frères, dans la plaine,
Chassaient les fils d'Enos et les enfants de Seth ;
Et l'on crevait les yeux à quiconque passait ;
Et, le soir, on lançait des flèches aux étoiles.
Le granit remplaça la tente aux murs de toiles,
On lia chaque bloc avec des noeuds de fer,
Et la ville semblait une ville d'enfer ;
L'ombre des tours faisait la nuit dans les campagnes ;
Ils donnèrent aux murs l'épaisseur des montagnes ;
Sur la porte on grava : « Défense à Dieu d'entrer. »
Quand ils eurent fini de clore et de murer,
On mit l'aïeul au centre en une tour de pierre ;
Et lui restait lugubre et hagard. « Ô mon père !
L'oeil a-t-il disparu ? » dit en tremblant Tsilla.
Et Caïn répondit : "" Non, il est toujours là. »
Alors il dit: « je veux habiter sous la terre
Comme dans son sépulcre un homme solitaire ;
Rien ne me verra plus, je ne verrai plus rien. »
On fit donc une fosse, et Caïn dit « C'est bien ! »
Puis il descendit seul sous cette voûte sombre.
Quand il se fut assis sur sa chaise dans l'ombre
Et qu'on eut sur son front fermé le souterrain,

Do you want some? Because Sweden is taking more than 10x what you are. You have about 23,000 meaning you only need to take about 194,000 more.

And hey maybe you'd like to adopt some babies to yourself, because after all some are poor and have been through wars and shit, so surely being selfless as you are, I'm sure you are willing to take care of some yourself.

No it's not. It shit that happens with crazies. And all countries have some crazies but doesn't mean we should be importing more. 

It's really disingenuous to pretend this has nothing to do with culture. Look [statistics](http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/).

* 76% in favour of death penalty for leaving islam

* 82% in favour of stoning for adultery

* 88% consider islam to be playing a good role in politics.

How is ""Noi non siamo napoletani"" an insult? Is it an insult towards Brits if I say ""'I'm not British"". They take it as an insult and you should draw your conclusions from that. I don't deny there is racism towards the South. A month doesn't pass without hearing at least one ""maledetti terroni"". So? It's in no way affecting the shitty economy of the South. I gave you this example as to see who gets punished. Why did the Juve fans get punished? Because they're the Northeners. The fair thing would be for both teams to be punished but no, just the Northeners.

As for the Lega Nord. First of all the Lega Nord is not longer wanting separation for some years now. Second of all wanting separation doesn't mean racism. Are the Scottish racist against the English? I think not. And maybe you should give yourself a minute to think why 3 out of Italy's 4 richest regions have(or recently had) Lega Nord's people as leaders.

I don't think the South was in any way shape or form screwed over more than the North. And even if so, yeah, how about moving on?

&gt;Italy was united in 1861, how come more than 140 years weren't enough to make southern Italy on par with the rest of Italy? That's not normal to me, something must be off

Yeah, you know what I agree. *Something* must be off. This problem will never be resolved. The Northeners won't start thinking like Southerners and vice-versa. The Austrians won't start thinking like Greeks. So what is off? After all those years of investment, of fighting crime, of smaller taxes and of overall tolerating and helping the South what *is* off?

true,elscorcho2121,null,null,"*1. You won't be able to go just anywhere in Germany while based in Munich REASONABLY. For instance, train from Munich to Berlin is like 6 to 8 hours. Do you have time for something like that? If you stay in Munich, the furthest I would venture for an outing is maybe Cologne (if you want to keep in Germany). Germany is WAY bigger than you are most likely anticipating it to be. DRINK LOTS OF WATER.

*2. You should definitely do a biking tour of Munich, and the English Garden. Also if you come to Berlin, the Reichstag is pretty cool. You can even go inside, but you have to bring your passport. Honestly, check out the FAQs of some of the German city subreddits, they are TREASURE TROVES of SECRET, INSIDER information about the best sites to see in those places. DRINK LOTS OF WATER.

*3. Avoid seemingly American or Mexican-style restaurants and shitty food locales. You came all the way here not to CAVE IN and have a steak or a burger!! Indulge in the local cuisine and ask people at hotel desks or tourist info centers for the down low on where to eat. Or just ask the people in the respective subreddits for whichever city you're in. There are large subreddits for almost every large German city. Also, 99% of the time there are NO free refills at restaurants, and you will normally have to PAY for normal table water (comes in a bottle). If you are really cheap and thirsty, ask in German for ""Leitungswasser"" (means tap water). Sometimes they will oblige and just give you a glass for free. Remember: ice will come at MAX 2-3 cubes in your drank.  DRINK LOTS OF WATER.

*4. If any gipsy-looking people come up to you while you're in a town square or on the street asking you desperately if you speak English, don't say anything to them, just ignore and go about your way. Don't be surprised at how good they can speak English either. They're trying to hold your attention while someone else swings by and tries to grab your bags/wallets. DRINK LOTS OF WATER.

*5. To avoid costs what I like to do is research wherever I'm going on WIKIVOYAGE.ORG before going. And also use AirBnB or a similar service to scrounge up your accomodation, oftentimes better results than 4 star hotels and 5x cheaper. DRINK LOTS OF WATER.

*6. You can drink beer in public in Germany, it's great. Try it out: grab a beer from a corner store and walk around the town. The whole time you will feel paranoid because what you are doing is largely illegal in America! But relish in this rebellious glory while you can! :) The [Zyankali Bar](http://www.zyankali.de/anfahrt/) in Berlin has an amazing ""Pangalaktischer Donnergurgler"" (Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster). I know the owner, too! It's a great place, they all speak perfect English there. Tell them Alex from Ohio sent you. DRINK LOTS OF WATER.

*7. You will not get anyone accidentally upset if you are paying attention to your surroundings. The ""thumbs up"" thing is ridiculous and I've never heard of that (living in Germany for many years now). If you are chatting in English with a German, speak as slow and accent-less as you can. Try not to use confusing figures of speech like ""bells and whistles"" or ""down in the dumps"". Also know there are different idiomatic conventions for Germans. An example is that Germans say they will ""press their thumbs"" to give you good luck, but if you told them you are keeping your fingers crossed, they would probably not understand you immediately. There are no ""serious"" faux pas you should have to worry about. Just don't dress like someone's soccerdad with hiked up shorts and sandals with socks and a baseball cap. Keep your outfits non-nationalistic, generally non-OBNOXIOUS, and you'll be fine. DRINK LOTS OF WATER.

*8. Hitler jokes shouted out loud in a public square are scaled at 10. Unwitty Hitler jokes to your friends may be around 7. Witty and unserious Hitler jokes to a friend speaking in private are between 1 to 5. Not too serious, just don't do them loud and in earshot of strangers (this is also known as practicing your common sense). DRINK LOTS OF WATER.

*9. Plan your spending allowances in advance and be smart about withdrawing from ATMs. Avoid shoddy looking ATMs at fastfood/corner store places usually. Look out for ""Sparkasse"" banks (pronounced Schpar-kass-uh), they are everywhere and are normally trustworthy in terms of their ATM machines not being hacked and modified by criminals (they target popular ATMs in areas with high foot traffic). REMEMBER TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND and enjoy yourself! Also, take lots of pictures, especially with you and your family members. It may seem lame and really uncool at the time to take lots of photos, but years down the road, you will thank yourself!!!!!!!!!!!!!

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"Great link by the way. It seems a lot of those higher ranked states have low populations (besides Texas) which may make running a state easier, or at least may make controlling inequality easier. 

Anyway, when I first looked at your list I noticed that most of them were Republican leaning and I took a guess and figured you compiled your shit list based on that fact, since many redditors place social values above all others for characteristics for what defines a good state. Too many people neglect the other important factors such as the fiscal shape of a state which are very important.

And also seeing Arizona (and also Utah) on your list made me cringe a little. I am from Arizona. I have lived in 6 different states and in my opinion, none of them were as great of a state to live in at all (my 2nd favorite being Utah). The reason why AZ is placed so low seems to stem from issues all related to the housing crisis which this article points out that:

&gt;Only Nevada suffered more than Arizona from the housing crisis. The state’s median home value fell by more than 36% between 2007 and 2012.

All of the other financial issues there result from the implosion of the tax base. 

Anyway, much of this is subjective making it difficult to really debate about. Thanks for clarifying your initial stance though. You definitely seem to have thought about this more than just ""Republicans are jerks"", an opinion thrown around all too often here and usually without much substance behind it.

- European partners are preparing to ease Athens' debt burden without writing off their loans but by stretching them out into the distant future, extending maturities from 30 to 50 years and further cutting some interest rates, EU officials say.

- It is a government version of the ""extend and pretend"" behavior of private lenders who keep bad loans on their books, hoping something will turn up, rather than writing down losses.

WHEN a new French law banned employers from checking work emails after 6pm, it was bound to grab headlines. It fit all too neatly the image held by les anglo-saxons of France as a work-shy nation of long lunches and short working weeks. And all too neat it was. In fact, no such law existed. But by the time anybody noticed, the damage had been done, prompting Axelle Lemaire, the new French minister for the digital economy, to tweet a denial (in English) on April 13th.

News of the French ban ricocheted through the English-speaking media at the end of last week. “No after-work e-mails please. French ordered to ignore the boss after 6pm” ran the title of one report. Plenty followed suit, for example, here, here and here.

Reports suggested that a new law covering about 1m employees forbade them from consulting emails before 9am and after 6pm. “C’est all right for some, quoi?” quipped Lucy Mangan in the Guardian, in a blog post that has since been corrected. And yes, oops, we were a bit overenthusiastic ourselves in one of The Economist’s London-based blogs.

In fact, there was no new piece of French legislation, but a labour agreement signed on April 1st by unions and employers in the high-tech and consulting field. It covers an estimated 250,000 “autonomous employees”, whose contracts are based on days worked, not hours, and so the 35-hour working week limit does not apply. The agreement does refer to an “obligation to disconnect communications tools”, but only after an employee has worked a 13-hour day. Such workers may work into the weekends too, but must be allowed to have one day off in every seven (24 hours + 11 hours). Nowhere does the agreement refer to a 6pm cut-off. By the standards of most French labour contracts, which have to apply the 35-hour working week, it is unusually liberal, and was designed to help global companies that deal across different time zones.

Needless to say, the French media unpicked the foreign reports with a mix of bafflement and indignation, leading to much grumbling on Twitter and finally to Ms Lemaire’s corrective tweet. The whole business was all the more awkward given that President François Hollande has been edging towards a more business-friendly economic policy under his new prime minister, Manuel Valls. Yet, with a 35-hour working week, entrenched union rights within companies, and a strict 3,500-page labour code, the reality remains that the country does not make it easy for firms to operate.

&gt;What’s going on here? The answer is that the list essentially tracks with places where the United States has a substantial diplomatic presence. (The United States has diplomatic relations with about 190 countries.)
In other words, Paul is counting Marine guards and military attaches as part of a vast expanse of U.S. military power around the globe. (In fact, under Paul’s logic, dozens of other countries are “occupying” Washington when they send attaches and other military personnel to their embassies here.) But this document indicates that only 11 countries actually house more than 1,000 U.S. military personnel.

Please remove yourself from the gene pool and do us all a favor.

This suggestion was presented as a condition for the European Central Bank to continue purchasing Spain's debt. [(source)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_employment)

First off, tuition at the good universities is non existent, you will only pay some small fees. Germany is odd, the better universities are the public, and nearly free ones, where the private ones are usually not as good. A bit reversed, and a bit awesome. As an American, yes, you do in fact, qualify for zero tuition payments. The program I have enrolled in will cost me a total of 2500USD for all fees and tuition (it would be only $500, but the semester in China costs $2000 tuition to the local university in China).

First off, you need to know English. German is not necessary (though I suggest learning it for cultural and social integration).

Second off, you certainly qualify for some related programs to what you want. I graduated with a mere 3.2 and have been accepted into 3 programs so far (still waiting to here back from others).

Check out DAAD.de and search for programs taught in English. This website is not 100% accurate, so you will need to look at the uni's website to be sure. Please note daad.de DOES NOT list all universities/programs, there are many others you will need to find through google searches and such.
