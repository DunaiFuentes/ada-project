Doesn't really seem like an extraordinary number. Given that many big parties run a joint list for the European Elections (EPP, S&amp;D), the new parties simply take their place and maintain the equilibrium.

As for fringe candidates: 

&gt; Kostas Kyriakou aka Outopos

A paedophile (by own admission), and suspected child molester (third party allegations) that is considered mentally deranged so no one takes him or the allegations against him seriously. He ran in every single election I can remember of, and always claims they are rigged. 

&gt; Michael Mina

That's a new guy, who delivered a speech about how the system is against his candidacy. (So the system does their job well, cause I've never heard of that guy before)

&gt; Andreas Efstratiou

That one, I know. He's a guy who won a Guiness World Record for the longest tail in a bride dress he designed or something. The Guiness parent company sued Cyprus last year, when that guy used the Guiness logo as his candidacy logo for President. We had to reprint all ballots a week before the elections.

That's right.  But 31 is the highest I've seen so far.  In more typical elections I'd say we get around 8–12 candidates or lists.

&gt; What size are those?

Depends on the elections (I guess they pick a reasonable size to fit as many names as need to be printed out), but roughly A5 for list elections and A6 for post elections.

&gt; If you fill out a local ballot paper, it can look like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Stimmzettel_Kommunalwahl_Hessen_Beispiel_1.svg). And in local elections, you're even allowed to [strike out](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Stimmzettel_Kommunalwahl_Hessen_Beispiel_2.svg) single people in the list if you DON'T want to give them your vote. So in the end, the poor people checking all the votes might need to see things like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Stimmzettel_Kommunalwahl_Hessen_Beispiel_7.svg) and it's perfectly valid.

That's rather impressive.  Is the counting done by computer or by hand?

true,Aemilius_Paulus,RUSS,Russia,"&gt;You live in Latvia - be aware you'll have to become Latvian. We're no cultural melting pot America. We're a small homogenic country.

Latvia for Latvians! When idiotic Russian far-right groups chant 'Russia for Russians' this sub rightfully points out that such things are very much Nazi-like. However, sometimes this sub has only one set of glasses, the 'Europe is a paradise, Russia is always evil' glasses. 

For instance, every time Gypsies come out, this sub turns no less Nazi than most Russian Neo-Nazis, while Gypsies in Russia are actually comparatively tolerated (OK, it's not perfect, as far as minorities go, the perception of the Roma in Russia is better than in the West). 

Thing is, I know we all have some amount of nationalism in us reflexively, but you have to understand, if you think it is OK to say 'Latvia for Latvians' then you better keep quiet about most of your criticism of Russian antics these days because *Russians with your exact personality are the ones actually causing all of this trouble*. Mindsets like yours *are the problem*.

It's hilarious to me how you probably hate Russia for being nationalist when you yourself are a perfect example of such cancer. It is a cancer. Nationalism did no good to Europe. It is doing no good to Russia. USSR may have been a very terrible experience for the Baltics, but one of the reasons I liked USSR was because it de-emphasised nationalism on a relative scale in Russia. Now that it is gone, nationalism is once again a huge problem for us. 

So don't be that hypocrite. Don't act like the mirror of the nationalist Russian pricks. 'Latvia for Latvians' is what feeds those Russian minorities in Baltics that choose to be pricks. ",0,1399753042,null,0,false,0,chenivd,t3_256xze,t1_chenivd,t1_cheh8ax,null,1433739056,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,shotglass21,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; On the other hand, I get where they're coming from. I wouldn't want any children of mine being exposed to these things so early on either. Plenty of time to hear about that when they're teenagers, more mature, and less impressionable.

Most children are aware of what homosexuality is, at quite a young age, and it doesn't harm them to teach them that some parents are of the same gender and some aren't. Children aren't as dumb as we think, they pick up on things much earlier than we would assume; we can't protect from certain views for the whole of their childhood. This is why it's common to teach children sex education at an early age, as opposed to adolescence. When I was in primary school it was pretty common to hear children make homophobic comments and make insulting remarks about boys who were more feminine. Positive influences like this book help to combat such ignorant views.

Greece, however, is a much riskier investment. 

Now obviously you'd be a fool to invest in Greece over the USA/Germany if there wasn't something in it for you. So what happens is that the lower rating you have, the more interest you have to pay. Countries/Companies will want the highest rating because it means they can borrow money for cheaper. For an investor, you choose how much risk you want to take on.

In german local elections, you can do two things called [panachage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panachage) and [cumulative voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_voting).

First one means, you can vote for people from different party lists (as seen in the last picture, the person voted for two people from the PA-party and two people from the PB-party). Second one means, you can give candidates more than one vote (as you can see, ""Schaller, W."" and ""Probst, B."" got multiple votes).

Now to the counting. This scenario states every person has 15 votes (in the last local elections, I think I had 24). First you gotta count the ""direct"" votes given with the crosses. 

15 - 1 - 3 - 1 - 2 = 8 votes left

This voter here voted for the whole list of the PA-party (cross on top), so these remaining eight votes are distributed among the other party people from top to bottom.

So, ""Kunze, G."" gets another vote, ""Müller, F."" is striked out, so s/he doesn't get any votes, ""Schaller, W."" already has the maximum amount of votes so the next ones get the remaining votes.

So in the end, the PA-party gets 12 votes in total and the PB-party 3.

Additional information: 

If the voter here had 20 votes, then the list would be filled till the bottom and ""Kunze, G."" would get the third vote.

Striking out the ""Eirich, M"". in the list of the PB-party is irrelevant - but since striking out is valid, it doesn't spoil the vote.",0,1399754909,null,0,false,0,cheo90h,t3_257btw,t1_cheo90h,t1_chemlo7,null,1433739399,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Effectively if they completely fail to rate financial products correctly they can say 'oops, our bad' and take shelter in free speech laws. 

Effectively their ratings are only opinions, opinions written by institutions in only one country funded by the people they are supposed to regulate.

So, again, how is that a problem. Besides, they are only a small part of the population. If you want to solve that particular problem, you should ban birth control, force women to have more children or a hundred other things. It is not even remotely an argument. If you are a homophobe, come out as one instead of trying to attack an already vulnerable minority whereas both you and I know they have nothing to do with sinking birth rates in the West, they are neither the cause or the solution. The fact that you attack them for that speaks volume about you, and your attitude, nothing else. Good to have you tagged. 

And, you have one study, whereas my studies are more citied, and your study only focuses on lesbians btw. Nor do your study seem to (I've only looked through it superficially) seem to take in account that lesbians during the time period were subjected to discrimination. Nor do you seem to take into account that diversity (of which the study speaks) isn't necissarily bad. etc

true,wollphilie,GERM,Germany,"&gt; Austria is also changing tact this year in a plea for a more political statement. Drag artist Conchita Wurst, whose real name is Tom Neuwirth, will be representing Austria with a ballad ‘Rise Like a Phoenix’. Russians have suggested having such an entrant is promoting sodomy and goes against all that Russians stand for. Petitions have been launched in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus, calling for the entry to be disqualified, or edited out of the broadcast in their country.

true,352235,null,null,"&gt; Yes, but if children raised by them would become homosexual too, they'd multiply real quickly.

And it doesn't matter *since gay people can have children too*. As evident in your statement, you even talk about gay people's children! So, if they multiply, it means that they *can* have children. Basic evolution! Then it doesn't matter, so your worries are absurd.

&gt;That is all despicable things. You can't force people to have children. 

I agree, but it far more effective and to the point than attacking a vulnerable minority.

&gt;Are you even reading what I'm writing before calling me a homophobe? 

Yes, I have, and checked your studies too. But you don't seem to grasp the holes in your logic. ""If gay people's children are gay then the West will die out (I am exaggerating a bit, but that is the geist)"". No, *not if they have children*. Basic evolution. I'll give you a pass though and grudgingly admit to maybe you just didn't understand the gaping holes in your theory and is not a homophobe. Sorry.

For example in the the Abu Hamza debacle, the conservatives were considering leavng the Eu human rights courts so they could deport him more easily. They genuinly wanted to try revoke every Britains human rights just so they could deport one arsehole. Seriously that is fucked up.

true,shotglass21,UKGB,United Kingdom,"It should be pointed out that the Regnerus study has been debunked and discredited numerous times by the scientific community due its poor methodology and clear conclusive bias. It should also be pointed out that this study completely goes against the consensus of the vast majority of sociological studies on gay parenting, which show that children of same-sex parents have the same healthy upbringing as that of children to straight parents. Some studies even suggest that gay parents on average make more stable parents than straight parents due to the fact gay parents can't accidentally have a child, so a lot of preparation is made prior to parents having their child. This is especially true in the cases of artificial insemination, which costs a lot of money, and therefore means that parents must be financial stable to conduct such a procedure; hence giving the child a more stable upbringing.

Welche Konterbewegung soll das sein?[Die](http://www.ae911truth.org/) hier kann anscheinend nicht gemeint sein.

Ich bitte vielmals um Entschuldigung , dass ich denjenigen nicht glaube, die einen Krieg vom Zaun brechen, hunderttausende unschuldige im Irak und in Afghanistan töten ,weil sie 100% sicher sind ,dass der böse Diktator,den man selber unterstützt hat Massenvernichtungswaffen besitzt und die Terrorangriffe finanziert hat.

Die Ironie an der Sache ist, dass Leute, die der offiziellen Version glauben schenken selber die absurdesten [Verschwörungstheoretiker](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDfxB9nUfDc) sind.
Wie naiv muss man sein zu glauben,dass jemand aus den afghanischen Bergen heraus seine Krieger mit Teppichmessern losschickt und UNGEHINDERT zwei Flugzeuge ins WTC fliegen lässt.

Also only 500,000-ish immigrate into the UK every year out of which only around 70,000 are from the EU in fact we have more people comming from commonwealth countries than the EU, if anything shouldn't we block them from comming in?

Also can you guess the most common reason for people comming to the UK? it's education, people are comming here and throwing money at us to educate them.

If it were such a problem then we wouldn't give a damn about the EU we would be looking elsewhere for the immigration issues.

On peut aussi y « lire » un discret hommage au symbole fasciste des 2 faisceaux (haches) croisés (dont la partie basse forme un « lambda »).
Par ailleurs, ce « lambda » pouvant s’adapter en « tête » de flèche, on le retrouve, aussi, dans plein de combinaisons, avec lesquelles les groupes d’extrême-droite aiment « varier » les plaisirs.

We also closed down many ""fake"" schools in which students signed up too and paid but never went too, apparently to get into the country

Alas; Nigel says he does not oppose people coming here to educate or work and wants CLOSER ties to the commonwealth. Unless the schools were full or the work not in demand. This is where BNP slags them off for not ending all immigration.

With immigration numbers Nigel also outlines he wants MORE immigration from outside of the EU as we apparently currently discriminate against them. As with open borders with EU we have no choice of numbers (and no real record of numbers leaving or entering) so lower numbers elsewhere.

As for personal perspective; I agree. Having a better wage in the UK than your homeland is great; but that comes with increased costs, expenses and access to work in the UK. Half of UK's immigration issue is the fallacy that the grass is greener here!

As for the Grass is Greener; this is a fact of an opinion for many countries. (see france/uk border issue). For others such as new entrants they have closer ties and more in common with other Europe countries; so I don't follow Nigels suggestion that a lot CAN come - they prefer elsewhere.

Depending on where you live and what the polls are showing, it might be obvious that the last seat will be fought over by UKIP and another particular party (with the other seats being foregone conclusions), or it might be a mess, with several parties fighting over the last few seats, or maybe you will find that UKIP are nowhere near a threshold at which they would gain or lose a seat.

In my view, you are better off just choosing your favourite party, though.  The problem with tactical voting is that if everybody does it, the results won't reflect what people want at all.

la mancanza di legalitá non é tanto un problema per una startup tecnologica, diciamo forse che in italia tutto é piú caro e complicato per la corruzione endemica. Ma questo vale per una startup come per una pizzeria.

&gt;2- E' impossibile trovare i finanziamenti che ti consentirebbero di investire su un'idea vincente, perche' visto il punto 1 (e la quantita' enorme di cialtroni a giro) nessuno si fida.

Il problema dei finanziamenti é relativo. É sicuramente piú facile trovare soldi altrove, pero 1. la maggior parte di startup tecnologiche non ha bisogno di seed investment 2. se hai bisogno di seed dopo amici&amp;famiglia vai in una qualsiasi incubatrice in europa e lo trovi, se l'idea é quantomeno decente 3. quello che veramente manca é venture capital, il finanziamento necessario per scalare e siamo giá al secondo stage, 5 startup su 10 non arrivano neanche qui. Quando hai bisogno di VC hai giá le capacitá per fare i bagagli, andare a s.francisco e rompere i coglioni a un mucchio di gente. 

&gt;3- Infrastrutture pessime, burocrazia, costi enormi sia per le tasse che per la logistica e i servizi.

il problema della burocrazia si pone quando devi scalare. É il caso di idealista.com, che in italia non puó tecnicamente crescere perché al di sopra di un numero x di impiegati dovrebbe pagare un volume di tasse tali per cui i margini si assottigliano troppo (non ricordo la storia di preciso, pero era qualcosa del genere).

Briatore non si sbaglia troppo dicendo che una pizzeria, forse, é l'unica cosa all'altezza della classe imprenditoriale italiana. Il problema é che fare una startup significa creare qualcosa che puó scalare facilmente e rapidamente ma non vuol dire diventare ricchi con un sito internet, che é quello che il 90% degli italiani pensa.

Poi che abbia capito come creare valore aggiunto a un bordello (il billionaire) per vendere bottiglie di champagne a 2000 euro, non mi sembra sia sufficiente per andare a sborbottare alla bocconi.

The numbers from different surveys vary widely, largely because it's pretty much impossible to take closeted people into account and also because it's hard to come up with well-defined categories that account for everyone.  Also, contrary to popular belief, there are different levels of ""closeted"": you can feel comfortable telling your friends you are gay and yet still be hesitant to tell a researcher.  It's not as if you come out once and suddenly everyone you come into contact with knows.

It didn't even compare gay parents to straight parents, though Regnerus (a nutty born-again Christian who is actively involved in anti-gay political campaigning) wrote it up in a very misleading way in order to pretend that it did.  One of the same-sex marriage court cases in the US examined his work in a lot of detail, and he was cross-examined - the judge was extremely scathing [in his decision](http://www.scribd.com/doc/213772631/Doboer-Findings-of-Fact-and-Conclusions-of-Law):

&gt; The Court finds Regnerus’s testimony entirely unbelievable and not worthy of serious consideration. The evidence adduced at trial demonstrated that his 2012 “study” was hastily concocted at the behest of a third-party funder, which found it “essential that the necessary data be gathered to settle the question in the forum of public debate about what kinds of family arrangement are best for society” and which “was confident that the traditional understanding of marriage will be vindicated by this study.”...

&gt; While Regnerus maintained that the funding source did not affect his impartiality as a researcher, the Court finds this testimony unbelievable. The funder clearly wanted a certain result, and Regnerus obliged. Additionally, the NFSS is flawed on its face, as it purported tostudy “a large, random sample of American young adults (ages 18-39) who were raised in different types of family arrangements” (emphasis added), but in fact it did not study this at all, as Regnerus equated being raised by a same-sex couple with having ever lived with a parent who had a “romantic relationship with someone of the same sex” for any length of time. Whatever Regnerus may have found in this “study,” he certainly cannot purport to have undertaken a scholarly research effort to compare the outcomes of children raised by same-sex couples with those of children raised by heterosexual couples. It is no wonder that the NFSS has been widely and severely criticized by other scholars, and that Regnerus’s own sociology department at the University of Texas has distanced itself from the NFSS in particular and Dr. Regnerus’s views in general and reaffirmed the aforementioned APA position statement [saying that there is strong evidence that children raised by same-sex couples do just as well as those raised by opposite-sex couples].

Since then, the other states in the US defending same-sex marriage bans have conspicuously dropped any mention of downsides of same-sex parenting from their cases (one of them even submitted a motion asking a court to ignore this part of their testimony at the last minute) as they know the argument will be torn to shreds, and that their reliance on it will simply be seen as evidence that their position is based on irrational prejudice.",0,1399768196,null,0,false,0,chetet3,t3_257iwt,t1_chetet3,t1_cheqn13,null,1433741832,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Well okay. It's two things mainly. First the simpler reason: That ""Conchita"" person is just repulsive and I cannot understand people who actually try to tell me that she/he is beautiful or looks good or some shit because he/she clearly doesn't. Hell it's the fucking concept of that person to be as provocative and controversial as possible. That's another reason why I am disgusted by the person. Provocating just because you want to provoke is only acceptable for kids and teenagers. Adults doing it is simply a desperate and disgraceful (In German I'd say ""Würdelos"") try tio gain attention. And I don't really have respect for people who do it in such a cheap way. If you now want to try to explain me how ""intolerant"" I am or other bullshit, I'd like to remind you that the word ""tolerance"" stems from the latin ""tolerare"" which means: *bear, endure, tolerate*. Being tolerant doesn't mean I somehow have to force myself to like something but simply accepting it's existence - always keep that in mind. But that's just a side note. Now let's cut to the second and more important point.

The political aspect. The ESC should be - much like the Olympic Games - free from any political judgements. And this problem goes in both directions. First, booing at those poor Russian girls which have nothing to do *at all* with the current situation. This shows what ""unworthy"" people the audience was and that in return - you guessed it - disgusts me. Then, voting Conchita also happened purely/mostly for political reasons. Either to prove how ""progressive"" we are here in Europe (which by the way wouldn't be a neccessary act if the people who did that _really_ believed in that ""progressiveness"", but that's another topic and I simply assume you to be smart enough to understand the implication with this) or as *another* act against Russia because we all know that the Russian regime doesn't really like homosexual and transgender probably even less. Which is not only another useless provocation but also completely pointless. What exactly do the people think is achieved by this? That Putin suddenly pulls out of Crimea? That he maybe the Russian people will suddenly turn around 180° with their opinion and accept Europe as bringer of light and civilization to their dirty shithole of a country? Of fucking course not. Putin will not give a flying fuck and the masses will only take it as another hint at the depravity and decadence of the west. It's as useful as running with a white pride t-shirt through the bronx to show those guys who the boss.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"&gt;If the gay part of the population grows, we'll have less and less. And over a few centuries/millenia, we'd die out.

That's just an entirely irrational premise and absolutely would never happen.

Our populations are shrinking because our birth rates are shrinking.

Our birth rates are shrinking due to a number of societal factors and medical progressions; Homosexuality absolutely is not one of those factors.

You do not turn gay because your foster parents are gay. That's a simply proven fact and the proof of that is that there are millions of gay people who's parents were entirely straight. If there's a ""factor"" in upbringing that causes people to turn gay, then it's not exclusive to gay parents, on top of us not knowing what that factor is, if one exists at all, and therefore none of that factors in to this.

I'm not going to say gay parents don't effect your upbringing. I'm saying that there's no basis on which to claim gay parents = gay children.

The basis of your argument is that gay parents are ""far out of the norm"" and therefore produce abnormal children. Not an unfair premise when you take it at face value. But when you dig deeper all this is saying is that ""Gay people are freaks and therefore produce freaks"". Gay people are no different than anyone else, except that they have different kinds of sexual preference. They have jobs, pay taxes, hang out, have friends and socialize just like everybody else. 

Most teenage sexual development happens largely away from parents anyways.

Now, I'm not going to say I think being gay is ""normal"". It isn't. I think it's a disorder, the cause of which we do not fully understand yet. But homosexuals have been proven to work as perfectly functional members of society and it stands to reason that anybody they raise will also be a functioning member of society.

And I would just like to add that that study has been widely discredited in the scientific community as is written up by a fucking nutjob. I strongly suggest revising your view of it in that light.",0,1399772256,null,0,false,0,cheuxdy,t3_257iwt,t1_cheuxdy,t1_chep18e,null,1433742612,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Personally I don't want a Europe that respects Christianity (more than other religions, or lack thereof that is). I want a secular Europe that lets people choose.

I also don't understand exactly what he wants when it comes to the Hungarian people living in Romania for example. 

They already have almost everything translated in Hungarian in the counties where they are a large % of the population, have Hungarian classes from primary to upper education and have a party representing them in the Romanian Parliament.
The people of Hungarian descent are also given Hungarian citizenship, and Romania allows for dual citizenship, and since both countries are part of the EU they are free to move and work anywhere across the EU (meaning both in Romania and Hungary).

There is still unfortunate friction in the area, usually caused by various ultra-nationalist types (both Romanian and Hungarian) but otherwise I don't understand what more he wants ?

Until such a time as the creation of a fully fledged EU federation of states (at which point it might make sense to have them as a separate state), they are not likely to get much more.

Also it feels like he's effectively using the same argument as Putin while being in a union with the states he's pointing at (minus Ukraine), which doesn't make any sense to me.

First of all, Eurovision is a show contest with history and fans. It has not been, and is not, about the pure quality of the performance, but about the sum of the song, performance, advertising,  calculating what is just rightly liked around this year (Sweden is master of this), geography and trending gimmicks and tensions. Why Conchita succeeded this year is because she performed well, song was alright, she had previous exposure, had a gimmick and mainly, gathered protest votes around the Europe towards recent actions of Russia. Without the Ukraine &amp; Olympics in memory, she would not have won.

Secondarily, compare the queer phenomena to how the rock'n'roll was treated 50 years ago. Decadent shock then, and now just another have-seen, harmless and normal subculture among others. As the reactions today show, queer-culture isn't there yet, so exposure is timely and still needed. Hopefully in 20 years, it is just another boring normal thing with following among those who are into it. And that is what sympathy votes are about, showing that drag-queen with a beard is/will be as normal as rockabilly who is into american cars and Elvis. In the bigger picture, the phenomena in question is harmless, and it should be treated as such, like most of us already do. 

My hypothesis behind eastern attitudes is mainly in their low birth rates, and they are blaming gays about it with the weird speculation that gayness can be induced with exposure. While I see, that some bi-sexuals might choose to date with their gender in an accepting culture, that effect is such a small percentage that it won't change the whole. The reasons why heteros are having lesser kids has all to do with financial prospects, stable employment and faith in future, rather than exposure to gays. Blaming queers is scape goating of an easy target, instead of concentrating on the real financial issues behind the worries of how many kids can you raise well into adulthood.

The sovereign debt crisis is completely separate from the MBS crisis that started in the US (although the MBS crisis put stress on banks, but it is naive to think that would have never occurred otherwise). That is 100% made in Europe, and the ECB/EU has been very slow to react to that as well. EU banks are not only the largest in the world, but the EU has more of the largest banks than anywhere else in the world. EU banking laws which promote cross border mergers and aquisitions ensure they are only getting larger. France's two largest banks *each* have assets roughly equal to the entire economy of France.

These banks binged on high yielding Eurozone debt, essentially betting these countries (and by proxy, themselves) would be bailed out if anything went wrong. They were right. Eighty percent of Greece's bailout money is estimated to leave the country to service its debt. 

The ECB initially took a hands off approach to the liquidity crisis taking palace in its jurisdiction, leaving the US Federal Reserve responsible for injecting liquidity into the Eurozone. This was no small amount, it ranged from tens to hundreds of billions of short term 0% dollar loans outstanding at any given time, trillions in aggregate. The ECB still maintains a deflationary monetary policy despite urging by OECD (which is usually hands off), the IMF, and others. This is while the US and UK experience growth which many at least partially credit with more proactive monetary policies. 

There is plenty of blame to go around. People have every right to be upset with the EU and institutions like the ECB over their handling of the crisis.

4) the trains system is good, and fairly easy to navigate.  One note, careful of strikes in the summer, pay attention to the news/ ask your  hotel.  As to the eurail system, I believe it is a voucher which you can exchange for a certain number of trips.  Sometimes, it is cheaper to buy these tickets individually than in the bundle.  Look them up at trenitalia.com there is a high speed train from Venice to Florence to Rome to Naples, but you can also get a slightly slower train for half the price.  

5) I like Bologna a lot, and the trains that run from Venice to Florence all go through there.  It is nice to spend a day there.  

Siena, and maybe San Gimignano or chianti from Florence is a good day trip too.  You may be there at the same time as the Palio in Siena which is quite an affair.

Naples is... particular, read up on it before going.  You may prefer to stay in one of the cities on the Amalfi coast and go from there to the surrounding areas.  Trains in summer in the Naples area are not advised, I've always found them to be packed and delayed.  Mopeds are fun, but you have to know what you are doing.

Host: We just saw the final of Eurovision, we cheered for our girls, for sisters Tolmachev, and they performed very well, they are in top 10, but the result is predictable. Not a man, not a woman, with beard, bearded woman won. Conchita Wurst from Austria. Many countries gave max points, so I have a question -- Europe went complete mad?

Zhirinovsky: Yes! There is no end to our indignation. It's the end of Europe. It rotted. [audience applauds] They don't have anymore men and women, they have ""it"". Europe of neuter gender. [audience applauds] We had holiday with tears in our eyes [Victory Day], they have culture with tears in their eyes...

Alibasov: That's the common trend...

Zhirinovsky: Get off! Sit down! 100 years General Brusilov destroyed all Austrian divisions, 70 years ago Soviet army occupied Austria, we stationed there to 1955, we should not have left Austria [audience laugh]. There would have be other people there!

[...]

Danko: If you think that it's a victory, I'll say that it's a worst defeat of the European Union. Finally we see its real face.

Host: During the song, someone said from the audience that it's a funeral of the European Union, it's a requiem on the European Union. It's a requiem on the traditional values in Europe.

Danko: There was no performance, the person just stayed there. And let's objectively look at the appearance -- good God!

Host: Well, let's look objectively! I think it's a very precise, very talented representation of the today's Europe! Something like that, not a man, not a woman, completely lonely, flame bursts out of him... flames... that's hellish flame, that's the flame of Apocalypse.

Journalist of Komsomolskaya Pravda: That's personification of the new world, but we don't want to see this world.

Zhirinovsky: Do you think that Donbass can be with this Europe? No! There will be Russian flag over Donbass! [audience cheers] Russian flag over Donbass!

So after the USSR signs a friendship pact with Nazi Germany and then annexes the Eastern part of Romania, somehow we are the aggressors for fighting back... Perfect Soviet logic.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbentrop-Molotov_Pact
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_1940_Soviet_Ultimatum

&gt; *between 1940 and 1941, 200,000 to 300,000 Romanian Bessarabians were persecuted, conscripted into forced labor camps, or deported with the entire family, of whom 18,000 to 57,000 were supposedly killed.*

When the Russians arrived, they did things more barbaric and unthinkable than the Nazis ever had, and these things will not be forgotten. When the local populace thinks of Red Army soldiers as **worse than the Nazis**, are you sure you're really the good guys?

And that kind of contrived superiority is also why people here don't like you or your country. We were always squeezed between imperialists (Ottomans, Austro-Hungarians, Russians) and always had to pick sides and defend ourselves from their ambitions. Today, if Russian troops were somehow placed in Romania I can guarantee you would end up with guerrilla warfare. But there are already American, Canadian or Western European troops and people happily wave flags at their air shows, because they are seen as friends and protectors - mainly against Russia.

true,ErIstGuterJunge,null,null,"&gt;What do i need to know about getting a phone plan in Germany?

I would say that it is way more expensive than in Korea. 
There are several service providers and a lot of resellers (almost every supermarket chain has its own prepaid card offer)
The best coverage (in my opinion) is offered by T mobile (its the one that build the first cellphone network) but they are also the most expensive.  My personal favourite is O2. They offer a T mobile roaming service for the contract customers, so you won't have to worry about bad reception too much. The resellers are really good too and if you already have a phone you can get some really good deals. 
I would avoid everything related to e plus / base because my personal experience is that they offer a bad reception and are expensive too. 

&gt;Is there anything with unlimited talk/text/data? I'm in Korea now and have 300talk/text and unlimited data.

Talk/text/data Flatrates are available but the data isn't really unlimited. You get a certain amount of data with high speed Internet and after that is used up your speed gets reduced. The more data you need in the high speed connection the more you have to pay. Usually the plans start with 300 mb and you can go up to several gigabytes. 
It gets expensive really fast.

true,[deleted],null,null,"By Eastern Romania I take it you mean Bessarabia, land that was conquered from Russia during the tumult of 1918 by its wartime ally Romania? Romania took Russian land, 20 years later Russia forced Romanja to give it back by ultimatum. How is Russia the aggressor? The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was, as is common knowledge, a power game. Hitler hoped to buy enough time to tie up the western front and attack Russia in full strength. Stalin hoped it would buy Russia enough time that it could be the attacker. It is unclear when this attack was planned (I've seen numbers ranging from two weeks to two years later than Barbarossa, and a relative who was close with Marshall Bagramian said he claimed it was planned for Spring of 1942), but it never happened. Nonetheless, a coalition of countries (that would be the aggressors, one of whom was Romania) attacked the USSR on June 22, 1941, meaning Hitler succeeded and Stalin committed the single greatest blunder of his career.

Now, by when Russians arrived, do you mean 1944? Well, of course they were worse than the Nazis. First, you guys were allied with the Nazis, so it only makes sense that they would treat you better than an invading army would. Second, as I'm sure you can imagine, our people were pretty pissed about the whole ""Hitler led coalition of which you were a part attacking our country and causing tens of millions of deaths in an attempt to enslave/exterminate its population"" thing. If I was a soldier who just spent four years walking through hell (realistically less since almost everyone who was there at the beginning would be dead by the end), with knowledge my village was burned down and my family slaughtered as was often the case, you bet your ass I would take out my aggression on fascists and their allies.

""Good guys""? The very notion is childish. Yeah, we were the good guys as far as our national interests were concerned (who isn't?), and I would say I personally (and hence without pretense of objectivity) would classify Russia as the good guys, mostly because the other side was actively trying to enslave or kill my family for being subhuman scum of an inferior race. Granted the communists were keeping my family in close to slavery conditions and it's sheer luck that they didn't kill any directly, but still. Lesser of two evils by a wide margin.

I know plenty about how much Eastern Europe dislikes us as I've been to most of it, though not your country, which by all accounts is lovely. What is this hatred supposed to prove? I hate the communists too. If communism was brought to Russia at the head of an invading army from an enemy power, I'd hate it even more than I currently do. Your hatred is irrelevant. As I've said before, the main use of Eastern Europe during the Cold War was was as a buffer zone, meaning it was the land that mattered, not the people. Sure, many of my fellow Russians have fallen for the Soviet propaganda stance about glorious liberation and all that, but I'm not an idiot. Your country and the others became ours purely by right of conquest. Your country suffered? Good, for in my eyes that is merely retribution. Even then, it falls short of justice because I guarantee you my country suffered more at the hands of Germany and its allies, of which your country was one, than Romania did under Soviet occupation. Having said that, I do feel bad for the Czechoslovaks. They're really the only ones that are plausibly innocent victims of this whole thing. Everyone else got what was coming to them.

The notion that Russia would invade Romania is ridiculous. Rogozin clearly agrees with me because I doubt he expected anyone to take his statement seriously. Do you honestly think he, in his official capacity as deputy pm, threatened Romania with strategic bombing? I can't think of a more obvious joke if I tried. You guys must be really paranoid if you took it seriously. Why the hell would Russia invade Romania? I mean sure, your women are beautiful and I bet you have a nice beach or two, but really: why? The only reason Crimea was taken is that the west kept trying to expand NATO to Ukraine, an entirely unacceptable move from the point of Russian national security. Justice and morality aside, there was a clear pragmatic reason for doing so. Harbor all the paranoid revenge fantasies you like, they will continue to exist only in your head.

I don't know why you think me pointing out that your grandpa and his generation fought for the Nazis means I must be a communist. The only Russians with significant emotional attachments to Lenin statues are elderly people who have a hard time adjusting to the modern world. A lot of my generation takes the toppling as an insult, mostly because it's meant as one by those doing it, but thar doesn't make them communists. Ban the hammer and sickle, who cares.

It was enacted after they amended the wording from forbidding  ""propaganda of homosexual, bisexual or polygamous relations"" into the above quote. IIRC Ukraine were first to propose a ""propaganda"" law, exluding Lithuania, which was not only very similar to the current Russian law, but influenced it.

I'll be back with news sources.

EDIT: [Here's a BBC link from 2012 with some information on their bill](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19881905) and a [small article here from the same year](http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/ukraine-votes-anti-gay-propaganda-law021012). It looks like nothing came of it, and after Maidan and with Ukraine seemingly wanting closer ties with the EU I don't think they'll be in a rush to bring in any legislation similar to it. 

As for Russian law influencing the Lithuanian one, IDK. The Russian propaganda law wasn't in effect when the Lithuanian law did, so unless there were existing laws that influenced it I couldn't say.

Beh, se ti vuoi occupare di automazione industriale, robotica o telecomunicazioni i capitali servono, eccome! Se non altro per coprire il tempo, i macchiari, la ricerca e i costi di gestione -  finche' non riesci ad arrivare a un prodotto da vendere.

You comment reads like you think homosexuality is undesirable in a child, and something abnormal in a person in general.

If you had been exposed to such content at a younger age in conjunction and harmony with all the rest of the fairytales, wouldn't you perceive the subject as more natural now? I think that's the point here. If you exclude homosexuality until adulthood, then it's going to be abnormal and odd. You'd need to deny children all the fairytales for this to not happen. There shouldn't be homosexuality and heterosexuality - just sexuality.

We are still gripped by the past - we have been raised in a time where homosexuality might not have been acceptable, but it doesn't need to be like that for our children. Where we might accept it, but at times fail to see it as natural is very much product of the society where it was not treated as an equal way to live one's life, but something that we need to hide. If we raise our children properly, they won't need to second guess as we do. They'll have no desire to hide homosexuality from a children's book as we do because deep down we think it's unequal to a heterosexual relationship.

true,Vive_la_France,YAFrance,France,"Greetings Alex. I don't understand why you ask about him in this thread, but here is my opinion. Napoléon Bonaparte is a national hero. If someone has anything negative to say, I tell them to put it in historical context. His genious (military, political, social) are far ahead of his time. He saved the République, brought back order and law at a time of anarchy and bloodshed, he made France glorious, our flag flew over the pyramids. He defended France against countless of coalitions of monarchies which tried to force France back to monarchy. He gave civil liberties to his people (Code Civil des Français), and to other people (Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Portugal, and the United States' Louisiane state still use his Civil Code). He won beautiful battles, such as Austerlitz. He created many institutions that are still essential in Frace today, for example the Legion d'Honneur medal to reward the greatest servants of the state (which with other measures, reinforced the French republican idea of meritocracy, as opposed to inheriting social position). He created the ""Conseil d'Etat"", the ""Banque de France"" (national bank), ""Cour des Comptes"", ""Franc Germinal"" (monetary unit), the ""Lycée"" (high school), and several ""Grandes écoles"", the best engeneering schools in France and among the best in the world. He built and restored many buildings and monuments that are still important in Paris and other places in France, in addition to the abolishion of death penalty for homosexuals, just to name a few.

TL;DR: Napoléon est un héro national et un génie militaire et politique/social, il faut le comprendre dans un contexte historique et ne pas faire d'anachronisme.

true,timoleon,FRNK,Franken,"&gt;Offenbar übten Netzwerke von Alt- und Exnazis Anfang der Fünfzigerjahre erheblichen Einfluss aus.

Das ist eine lange bekannte Tatsache der Adenauer-Zeit.

""Geheimarmee""?

Im besetzten Deutschland von 1945 wäre das ohne Mitwissen und Zustimmung der Westmächte wohl kaum möglich gewesen.

&gt;Waffen sollten im Ernstfall aus Beständen der Bereitschaftspolizei kommen; ein Mitstreiter von Schnez hatte Zugriff darauf, weil er im Innenministerium arbeitete.

Bereitschaftspolizei?  Die gab es 1949 noch nicht, [laut den Plänen von 1950/51](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bereitschaftspolizei) war für sie nur eine endgültige Stärke von 30.000 Mann vorgesehen - die erst über einen jahrelangen Aufbau erreicht werden sollte.

Da wären zusätzliche Waffen für 40.000 Mann aber schon sehr aufgefallen…

Insbesondere weil es damals keine bundesdeutschen Hersteller gab, wie der Wikipedia-Artikel zur Bereitschaftspolizei erklärt:

&gt;Unklar war anfangs auch die Frage der Bewaffnung. 1951 war in der Bundesrepublik die Fabrikation selbst von Handfeuerwaffen noch untersagt; Waffen konnten daher nur durch knappe Devisen im Ausland erworben werden. Frankreich erklärte sich bereit, der „Landesbereitschaftspolizei“ deutsche Karabiner 98k leihweise aus Beutebeständen zur Verfügung zu stellen. 

Und betreffend die sonstige Ausrüstung:

&gt;Das Netzwerk von Schnez warb Spenden bei Unternehmen ein, besprach mit Speditionen, welche Fahrzeuge diese zur Verfügung stellen konnten,

Transport durch zivile Fahrzeuge auf freiwilliger Basis?  Wie viele davon wären bei einem sowjetischen Angriff wohl tatsächlich verfügbar gewesen, die Spediteure hätten vielleicht eher sich selbst und ihre Angehörigen evakuiert…

Aus der Wikipedia zur Bereitschaftspolizei:

&gt;Da auch Kraftfahrzeuge knapp waren, bot sich die westdeutsche Automobilindustrie an, dem Bundesinnenministerium mit einem Kredit über zwei Millionen Mark zu helfen.

Selbst bei der offizielle Truppe hatte man also Schwierigkeiten, sie angemessen auszustatten. Bei einer  inoffiziellen wäre das noch um vieles schwerer gewesen, insbesondere mit einem Drittel mehr Personal.

&gt;Die konspirative Schnez-Truppe wollte sich den SPIEGEL-Informationen zufolge bei einem sowjetischen Angriff zunächst ins Ausland absetzen und dann von dort aus die Bundesrepublik freikämpfen. 

Der erste Teil dieses Satzes ist der glaubwürdigere.

Alles in allem dürfte diese Armee mehr ein Wunschtraum des beginnenden Kalten Krieges als Realität gewesen sein.

Ensuite, l'intérêt de quand même continuer de regarder la télé est que c'est un média qui impose le contenu, contrairement au web où on choisit le contenu. Choisir son contenu a un corollaire néfaste: on ne voit que ce qu'on veut bien voir. Les suggestions Google, YouTube, etc. même si elles rendent service pour faire le tri dans l'immense choix qu'offre le Web contribuent aussi à cet effet.

A contrario, être ""contraint"" à regarder une émission a priori sans intérêt (parce qu'il n'y a rien de mieux sur les autres chaines) peut amener à des découvertes intéressantes. Pour en revenir à l'Eurovision, derrière la seule victoire Française il y a un Gainsbourg, qui n'était pas encore ""populaire"" à l'époque.

&gt;*What Mr Barroso did instead, throughout his speech, was to float out all the core proposals in that draft treaty, but merely as ideas needing to be discussed. In particular, these included the notion that the EU should be ruled by a bicameral legislature, with the European Parliament as its lower house and the Council of Ministers as its “senate” – with its executive run by a single “President of Europe”, combining the roles of those currently running the Commission and the European Council.*

&gt;*This was precisely the tripartite proposal put forward by Jacques Delors in 1990, prompting Mrs Thatcher’s famous response*: **“No, no, no.”**

Think of the women’s rights movement: »My god, why does she have to wear pants? Can’t she just wear a skirt like any decent woman? I don’t mind women, but why do they have to provoke and protest all the time? Can’t they just go about their lives?« — »I like women, I really do, but why should they be allowed to vote?

So reden gerne die Leute, die Immobilien verticken. ""Unterschreiben Sie hier, finanziert sich von alleine, sie haben keine Arbeit damit"". So bequem ist es in der Realität nicht. 

Nur mal kurz ein Problem von mehreren angerissen: Hausverwaltung zu sein ist ein sehr lukrativer Job, gerade bei grossen Anlagen. 

Jetzt gibt es gerne folgenden Effekt: Sind es viele kleine Eigentümer in einer Anlage, die ihre Wohnungen nicht selber nutzen und noch dazu weit weg wohnen und keine Arbeit damit wollen, werden Hausverwaltungen gerne faul und kümmern sich weniger um das Objekt, weil sie wissen, dass es nur sehr schwer gelingen wird, vor Ort bei der jährlichen Eigentümerversammlung die nötigen Mehrheiten für einen Rauswurf der Hausverwaltung zu kriegen. Hausverwaltungen müssen auf Zack sein bei Einzeleigentümern oder bei Anlagen, in denen Eigentümer auch wohnen, weniger im beschriebenen Szenario.

There wouldn't be any protests when they would be accepted, but they are not. Certainly not in Russia, where gays get harrassed, beaten up and tortured, with the police looking the other way or even taking part.

First the simpler reason: That ""Conchita"" person is just repulsive and I cannot understand people who actually try to tell me that she/he is beautiful or looks good or some shit because he/she clearly doesn't.

well, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. it's sometimes peculiar to see what some people call beautiful. starting with some fashion ""statements"" to body modification. and in the case of conchita, it's a mixture of political statement (more or less) and progressive personalia. i don'T know how many people would call her beautiful in the meaning of ""i fell in love in first sight"" but more like ""i like what she does, what she looks like and what she stands for, and that's beautiful"".

&gt;  Being tolerant doesn't mean I somehow have to force myself to like something but simply accepting it's existence - always keep that in mind.

exactly. and nobody forces you to like something.

&gt;  First, booing at those poor Russian girls which have nothing to do at all with the current situation. This shows what ""unworthy"" people the audience was and that in return - you guessed it - disgusts me. 

you can - as the host - say what you want how unpolitical your event is supposed to be, people will always express their feelings and opinions. and these russian girls were (like somebody said in this thread) the literal embodiment of russia that evening, and im sure people weren't booing at the girls per se, but for what they stand for. in this case, russia. and russia dun goofed, imo.

&gt; Which is not only another useless provocation but also completely pointless. What exactly do the people think is achieved by this?

maybe it was just a great performance, too. one doesn't win based solely on a political statement. but that is my opinion.

&gt; Putin will not give a flying fuck and the masses will only take it as another hint at the depravity and decadence of the west.

i agree. it was easy prey for the russian propaganda machine, but europe's people made clear that they don't agree with what russia does

Also, since OP is worried about data for texting: apps like WhatsApp use very little data, and German data plans usually work using throttling: You get, say, 500mb at full speed, and once you go over, you can still use data but at a very limited speed - which is still enough for texting.

Joint statement of the houses of Parliament on Ucrainian referendum on Dec 1, 1991.

1. We salute Kiev's choice for a democratic referendum on independence, blah-blah. Considering this referendum will also be held on romanian territories - Northern Bucovina, Land of Herta, Land of Hotin and the rayons in southern Bessarabia, the Romanian Parliament solemnly declares these territories were broken off from the country body, and the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact was declared null and void, ab initio, by USSR on Dec 24, 1989 and the Romanian Parliament on June 24, 1991. It is of course in Ukraine's right to organize a referendum for its independence, but this referendum cannot be valid in the romanian territories abusively annexed by USSR, territories than never belonged to Ukraine and are rightfully Romania's.
2. we're attached to the final act of the OSCE conference in Helsinki, which allows for peaceful and diplomatic border changes.
3. the referendum and its consequences are invalid for previously mentioned territories
4. we ask all countries that will recognize the independence of Ukraine to acknowledge it doesn't apply to said territories
5. we're open for dialogue with Kiev to examine the problems in the way of a good neighborly relation, and in this sense we invite a ukrainian parliamentary delegation to visit Bucharest as soon as possible
6. we ask the government to urgently open negotiations with Kiev about the territories forcibly annexed by USSR

* A small storm appeared suddenly, [causing stormdamage. ](http://nos.nl/artikel/645956-schade-en-overlast-door-onweer.html) It was a windy day, and in the evening a big dark cloud of doom appeared.

Neither the public or the regular police was informed when someone suddenly got shot at with rubber bullets from a car. People started to panic and running. The major was furious saying that; if the regular police was at the scene they might have actually started a real firefight. Same thing happened last year, when the exercise included people shooting in the Vondelpark.

* The police arrested two Russians and someone from Armenia because they were driving in reverse over the highway and because they were very stoned.

Minister for Justice Alan Shatter has stepped down, he was implicated in wilfully ignoring corruption in the police despite a legal obligation to deal with it.

Gerry Adams (leader of former IRA political wing Sinn Fein) was released without charge following his arrest relating to the murder during the troubles of Jean McConville.

&gt;Bereits 1948 waren in Niedersachsen trotz Verbots der britischen Militärregierung, jedoch mit deren stillschweigender Duldung, Polizeireserven aufgestellt worden, die in sogenannten Einsatzzügen operierten und in Watenstedt, Wolfenbüttel, Bad Harzburg, Dedelstorf bei Uelzen und Hann. Münden stationiert waren. 

&gt;Sie dienten der Überwachung des illegalen Personenverkehrs und der Bekämpfung von Kapitalverbrechen an der Demarkationslinie zur SBZ bzw. DDR.

Die notwendige Duldung und Kontrolle durch die jeweiligen Besatzungsmächte muss man in Zeit des beginnenden Kalten Krieges als nahezu unvermeidbar ansehen.  

In der DDR fand zu selben Zeit ebenfalls eine heimliche Aufrüstung mit Hilfe der Sovietunion statt.

In beiden deutsche Besatzungsgebieten wurden von den jeweiligen Siegern bewaffnete, militär-ähnliche Verbände aufgestellt, entweder getarnt als besondere Polizeiformationen, oder im Geheimen.

[Hauptverwaltung Ausbildung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauptverwaltung_Ausbildung)

&gt;Als Kaderschmiede der künftigen Streitmächte der DDR verkörperte die Hauptverwaltung Ausbildung als Nachfolger der Verwaltung für Schulung den militärisch orientierten Teil des Ministeriums. 

&gt;Mit der Zugehörigkeit zum MdI und dem damit suggerierten Eindruck einer Behörde mit Polizeicharakter wurde der „verdeckten Aufrüstungspolitik“ innerhalb der Sowjetischen Besatzungszone Rechnung getragen, um den im Sommer 1945 beim Potsdamer Abkommen verabschiedeten Beschluss zur Demilitarisierung Deutschlands nicht öffentlich zu verletzen.

Zur vorhergehenden ""Verwaltung für Schulung"" siehe hier: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasernierte_Volkspolizei

Besondere ""Volkspolizei-Bereitschaften"" gab es ebenfalls, aufgestellt ab 1948:

&gt; 22\. September 1948: Bildung der Hauptabteilung Grenzpolizei/ Bereitschaften bei der Deutschen Verwaltung des Inneren (DVdI) und Aufstellung von kasernierten Bereitschaften, aus denen die Kasernierte Volkspolizei (KVP) und später die Nationale Volksarmee hervorging.

&gt;1949 wurden in den Ländern Wachbataillone unter Integration der bestehenden kasernierten Bereitschaften aufgestellt.

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft

Die ""Schnez-Armee"" könnte theoretisch auch in dieses Schema passen. 

Aber wegen der Schwierigkeiten bei der Ausrüstung selbst der offiziellen Bereitschaftspolizei, und der umfassenden Überwachung durch die Alliierten, dürfte eine deutschen ""Geheimarmee"" wohl eher in Ansätzen und auf dem Papier existiert haben.

Soviet occupation costed Estonia 3rd of its population. Many of them shot and sent to gulag and rest deported.

true,champ1337,NETH,"The Netherlands, not Holland","Hitler was **NOT** democratically elected.
He never received a majority of the vote of the German people. In 1932 Hitler challenged von Hindenburg for President of Germany, [but lost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_presidential_election,_1932#Results). In the first round of voting von Hindenburg got 49.6% of the vote, Hitler got 30.1%, and Ernst Thälmann of the Communist Party got 13.2%. Since no candidate had received a majority, a second round of elections was held, with Hitler again losing to von Hindenburg. This time von Hindenburg got 53% of the vote, Hitler got 36.8%, and Thälmann got 10.2%

As for the general election of July 31, 1932, the Nazis got 37.27% of the popular vote. In the November 1932 elections the Nazi party got 33.09% of the popular vote (this after massive intimidation and voter violence by the SA). In the March 1933 election the Nazis got 43.91% of the vote (this after tens of thousands of Communist Party members and leaders were jailed because of the powers given to Hitler by the Reichstag Fire Act and the Enabling Act). 

In November 1933 there was another election, but this one was a complete farce. Hitler had already seized complete control of the government, and the Nazi party was the only legal party. Of course they finally got their majority with 92% of the popular vote. 

Neither Hitler nor the Nazi party ever got a majority of the vote. 

A good summary of the events leading from the 1932 election to Hitler assuming total control can be found [here](http://history1900s.about.com/od/1930s/a/Hitler-Appointed-Chancellor.htm).

Lebanon has taken in over 1 million syrian refugees, that is over 25% of their population, Jordan and Turkey have taken in over 500,000 each even after being denied EU money to construct more refugee camps.

Italy has taken in an estimated 4,600, France has taken in 500. Who the fuck are we kidding? These people

Sirmione is inside Lake Garda, so two birds one stone



As for Verona, there aren't too many things to see there, but that's a good thing. After visiting Juliet's Balcony and the arena, you can immerse yourself in traditional Italian culture. 


For the full historic experience, I would recommend a two/three day trip through Venice -&gt; Padova -&gt; Vicenza :) -&gt; Verona -&gt; Lago di Garda. 


Venice is self-explanatory for why you would want to visit, make sure you visit Murano which is an island in Venice famous for their glass blowing, after Murano make sure to stop by Burano which is known for their laces. Padova has a plethora of beautiful churches, they are also known for their University and their Botanic Gardens. Vicenza housed Andrea Palladio in the 16th century; he built La Rotunda (What inspired the Lincoln Memorial), the oldest covered Teatro in the world (Teatro Olimpico, where I'll graduate :) ), and a beautiful Basillica in Piazza dei Signori. And I explained Verona up above.  Lago di Garda doesn't have *too* much historical significance, but it's a nice place to stop by.

* Depending on the new Eurostat procedure for determining the public debt, it's possible that Slovak dept will reach 57% of GDP this year, meaning the government would have to make a balanced budged for 2015. Or change the constitution, so they don't have to do anything.

* The so much celebrated tax lottery has in fact only earned 7-8M €.

You pose a very important question. I think there are two reasons the US is comfortable influencing the international scene, one rooted in idealism and the other in pragmatism:

1. Many Americans feel a moral obligation to use our power to help those in need and to right injustices, and that national borders should be considered but are not inviolable in this pursuit. As long as this attitude prevails, the American people will generally support an 'aggressively magnanimous' foreign policy. There are many, *many* criticisms that can be leveled against the effects of this relentless idealism, but as they say, ""the kid's got his heart in the right place,"" and (at the risk of editorializing) I think that means a lot. We want to be a force for good, and that seems incompatible with a passive foreign policy.

2. And from a more utilitarian perspective, Americans recognize that we have national interests abroad, and think it reasonable to use our influence to safeguard those interests. Instincts of self-preservation and all that; no one else is looking out for us - indeed, people are actively trying to mess with us - so we need to do it ourselves.

We vehemently disagree among ourselves on how to go about accomplishing these foreign goals, but broadly speaking we feel we have the right to pursue them.",0,1399820969,null,0,false,0,chf6wpb,t3_2554o2,t1_chf6wpb,t1_chf3oxr,null,1433748325,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

Ahhh, and there we see some real European courage, my lads. Did Europe do anything concrete to save Ukraine? Not a thing of course, Europe is a spineless, castrated crowd of dithering old hags who will only invade some severely outclasses Third World nation and then only usually when US is leading the effort with their actually capable military. Europeans will mercilessly dismiss the Russian military as a bunch of incompetent drunks and then hide under their blankets following such an outburst of courage 'till US shows up. They won't do anything decisive. However booing a few underage girls?? Sign us up! Such bravery. 

This sub is the only thing that's holding me back from entirely defecting to the West. Putin may be a shitty megalomaniac dictator, but whenever I look at the people on this sub, they're not better, they are circlejerking bullies and cretins, or racist pricks who will condemn Russia's nationalism and racism and then put on a Hitler hat and declare that 'X country is for X people' dammit (so many times I hear this, I don't know if anyone here has a sense of irony) and that Roma are the scum of the earth.  

Never change /r/europe, never change. Obviosuly I won't support Putin just because the people here are so shitty, but nor will I cheer on for Europe, not when I see that it is made up of the same people. Only thing different are the gov't propaganda lines.

I never understood this considering how historically anti-progressive Russia/USSR has been (with the exception of the time period between 1917 and 1930ish). More recently you've seen this phenomenon with China.

You dont have to go far to find them. Even in this sub people were talking about how Russia is a better partner than the US (before January) and how the US was the real imperialist power in Europe due to its military bases. This is despite the fact the US was significantly withdrawing troops from Europe, and had had plans to withdraw more. You would not have to look far to find highly upvoted comments talking about how people can't wait for China to be the largest economy in the world and wield most of the political and military power. 

The US is in a unique position. It is *by far* the most powerful military in the world, both currently and historically. Yet weaker countries constantly invite it to open bases on their soil. The Philippines just requested a larger US presence, and wrote a law allowing for it. Keep in mind the Philippines used to be a US imperial holding. Vietnam through ASEAN is talking to the US about a greater presence there. China built an oil rig in disputed water with Vietnam and threatened to give them the ""lesson they deserved"" if they did anything about it. China destroyed 8 Vietnamese ships that were sitting there in protest. 

All of these countries are confident they can invite the most powerful military in the world within their borders and it will not seize power or take their land. In fact, the Philippines gained independence from the US via agreement, not war. Not many other major militaries are invited to open bases on foreign soil as a deterrent to nations that would threaten the hosting nations' sovereignty, but you see this phenomenon over and over with the US. As of now, the US has not tried to take more land than it was leased, and it often pays the hosting nation lease payments, depending on the agreement. 

Idolizing Russia, and now China is nothing new. Even Orwell talked about it. The only difference is China has now been added to the ""good guy"" list:

true,shutupbabyiknow,EURO,European Union,"Whilst being very popular on this sub, this is simply not the truth.

According to the Ministro degli Interni in 2008, 73% of illegal immigrants in Italy arrived through the airports of Milan and Rome with tourist visas. Only 12% arrived by boat from northern africa. 

Between 2008 and 2009 there were 29,000 migrants coming by boat per year. This decreased down to 3,500 per year between 2009 and 2010. From 2011 to 2012 the number increased again up to 17,000 per year.

This highlights the fact that migration is highly correlated to the political stability (war, famine, persecution) of african and middle eastern countries and that in times of relative stability the number of migrants is exceptionally low like in 2009.

In 2013 Italy experienced a drastic increase in immigration coming from boats. Following the war in Syria and government abuse in Eritrea the number has increased to about 40,000 per year.

Of the 42,925 migrants who arrived to Italy by boat in 2013, there were 11,300 Syrians 9,834 Eritreans, 3,263 Somalians, 3,263 Egyptians 2,600 Nigerians 1,058 Malians and 879 Afghanis.

Of the 42,925 migrants 73% had a right to protection.

[Daniele Glaser ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniele_Ganser)ist ein 9/11-Truther und  Verschwörungstheoretiker. 

Seine Veröffentlichungen zu Gladio und anderen ""NATO-Geheimarmeen"" sind in eben diesem Tenor gehalten, bedienen sich zweifelhafter bis gefälschter Quellen, und wurden auch entsprechend von anderen Historikern rezensiert:

&gt;Für Peer Henrik Hansen (Journal of Intelligence History) ist Gansers Buch Teil einer Welle neuer, seit dem 11. September 2001 üblicher Verschwörungstheorien. Für wissenschaftliche Seriosität fehle ein Kapitel über das verwendete Quellenmaterial und die Methodik. 

&gt;Ganser verwende hauptsächlich Presseberichte und Politikeraussagen, bei denen Desinformation nicht von ernsthafter Recherche unterscheidbar sei. Er behaupte eine Verschwörung der westlichen Regierungen und ihrer Geheimdienste, vor allem CIA und MI6, mit den NATO-Geheimarmeen, die die herangezogenen Zeugenaussagen gerade nicht bestätigten: Demnach hatten Geheimdienstvertreter in den NATO-Gremien kein Stimmrecht. 

&gt;Er verschweige, dass eine seiner Hauptquellen, ein US-Armeehandbuch, schon seit 1976 als Fälschung des KGB enttarnt worden sei, und dass viele Stay-Behind-Truppen aus Freiwilligenverbänden hervorgegangen und von den späteren NATO-Mitgliedsstaaten selbst gegründet worden seien.

&gt;Auch der Historiker Gregor Schöllgen verriss das Buch, weil hier auf spärlicher Quellenbasis das tatsächliche Ausmaß der Stay-behind-Aktivitäten „grotesk überzeichnet“ würde. Während Ganser von *„geheimen deutschen Nazi-Stay-behind-Armeen“* in Divisionsstärke ausgehe, sprächen andere für die 1960er Jahre von weniger als 100 hauptamtlichen BND-Mitarbeitern und etwa 500 Helfern.

*Politics*

* The biggest news of the week is Norway suspending all EEA Grants to Hungary, because they are unwilling to assist Fidesz in misappropriating it (to their and their friends' pockets), something Fidesz officials think is their birthright. [Details in another thread here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2573wm/norway_suspends_grants_to_hungary_after/) 

* Another *mutyi* (the word [moot-yee] means petty dealings, but in the current sense of the word there's nothing petty about it: it refers to the Fidesz practice of granting very high value deals to friends of the party) popped up in the country: casino*mutyi*. So far only 3 casinos were allowed to operate in the country, [now 7 further is permitted to open.](http://www.politics.hu/20140507/economy-ministry-issues-seven-casino-permits/) All 7 permits went to 2 very prominent Fidesz sidekicks and their companies. One is Andrew Vajna, a Hungarian-American movie producer who produced among many others the Rambo series, many Terminator movies and more. He's now The Guy on funding anything that has to do with television or cinema in the country. 

* PM Orbán hopped around Europe a bit, he visited Poland and [then continued on to Berlin where he held a speech](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aca2521a-d6a6-11e3-b251-00144feabdc0.html) focusing on lowering energy prices (essentially talking about their crusade to forcibly lower utility costs in the country) and traditional, Christian family values, without which no civilization can exist according to him. 

* The city council of Miskolc, the largest city in the NE part of the country is [offering 1.5m Fts \(5k€\) to every ""poor"" citizen](http://www.politics.hu/20140509/miskolc-plans-to-pay-its-poor-to-leave-town/) willing to sell their Miskolc homes in a specific, ghetto area of the city and move to one of the villages near the city if they agree not to sell the new house for at least 5 years. Basically they plan on paying off the Roma to move out of the city limits so they would be no longer their problem. Very forward-thinking. 

* László Kövér was re-elected as Speaker of the House for the new term as well. Each party in the National Assembly can nominate a deputy speaker of the Assembly from their members. Jobbik's nominee has extensive skinhead background and a criminal conviction relating to that from the 90's and because of this, left-wing parties demanded Jobbik changes its candidate. As a retort, Jobbik released a photo in which a Socialist MP is posing with skinheads in 1992. [They did not change the candidate and in the vote Fidesz decided to not go against the nomination and voted him into the position.](http://www.politics.hu/20140507/parliament-elects-jobbik-mp-as-one-of-its-deputy-speakers/) which [didn't go over well with the EPP.](http://www.politics.hu/20140507/mep-says-epps-support-for-jobbik-lawmaker
) 

* An ex-Jobbik PM held a protest in front of the Parliament about the new land law, allowing foreigners to purchase land in Hungary under limited circumstances. [One of the cca. 50 elderly protesters spat on a Serbian-Hungarian politician who was passing by which caused quite the drama.](http://www.politics.hu/20140507/assault-on-vojvodina-leader-attack-against-nation-says-deputy-pm/) But hey, they are totes for the rights of ethnic Hungarians living in neighboring countries.

*Economy*

* [GDP set to grow over 2% in both 2014 and 2015.](http://www.politics.hu/20140505/eu-forecasts-hungary-gdp-growth-above-2-percent/) 

* [Michelin will close one of its Hungarian factory.](http://www.politics.hu/20140507/michelin-to-close-budapest-factory/)

* Russia cut the oil flow to Ukraine, which means they cut it to us as well because we use the same pipeline. MOL, the state oil company said [this is no problem](http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2014/05/06/mol-confirms-russian-cut-in-oil-flow-to-hungary-via-ukraine-says-no-big-impact/) for the supply system though. 

---
*Misc.*

* Orbán officially took his mandate and position yesterday in the Parliament in a ceremony. Later he had a private party at an upscale restaurant that irked some people because of the choice of location. It's a very expensive, long-standing restaurant that made its way into popular jokes about rich people because of its clientele. Plus it also helped that the dinner menus are between 150 and 300€ per person there, while the latter is the monthly salary of many in the country. 

* Wolf Prize winning mathematician László Lovász was elected the new president of the Academy of Sciences. He worked for 17 years at Yale and Princeton before returning to Hungary in 2007 to further scientific innovation here. According to his colleagues he's an easy-going guy that has the potential to make science more mainstream in the country with his media appearances. 

* András Kállay-Saunders delivered our second best performance ever in Eurovision by placing 5th yesterday. But of course people were far more interested/butthurt over the Austrian win and while the show was still happening envisioned that the streets will flow with rainbow-colored horse dildo robots that will attack people's behinds if Conchita wins. 

* [A laser physics giga project will be built in Szeged](http://www.politics.hu/20140509/ec-okays-e111mn-for-szeged-centre/) (as well as Prague and Bucharest) for 111m€, naturally from EU funds.

As always, people reading the tests online with the answers already supplied collectively decided that the tests were far too easy and that this is evidence on why all the teenagers are stupid, doing coke and partaking in orgies. 

* A murderer was caught 19 years after committing the crime. He was the prime suspect already in 1995, but DNA analysis was not available at the time, which would've confirmed his presence at the crime scene. Now a detective from the cold cases division reevaluated the evidence which led to his arrest.

Again: paying your GEZ fees does not magically grant you a license to publicly re-broadcast the program, just as purchasing a commercial software does not grant you the license to redistribute that software. Just as hiring a musician to perform at my venue does not automatically grant me the license to redistribute that music by selling a CD of their performance at my venue. This is really not hard to understand, you pretty much already said so yourself in your post:

&gt; [...] has paid for the use it **within the frame of what the license grants**

Also, again: This doesn't even have anything to do with the GEZ. It's the Gema/VG Wort representing the musician's/author's rights in this letter, not the broadcasting stations. Just because the broadcasting station has a license to broadcast the musician's/author's work and you have a license to watch that station, does not mean you suddenly also have a license to re-broadcast that work for free in your venue for your own financial gain (attract customers).

&gt; So, which organization can I join in Germany which will track all use of my code and collect the appropriate license fees and automatically directs my part of it to me?

Not sure why you keep bringing this rhetorical question up again and again, as this doesn't even remotely relate to this issue, but there's obviously no such organization because there's no demand for that in our industry. Software developers are generally permanently employed or do contractual work for specific clients. This is very much different from how authors, journalists, musicians or artists and photographers work, where the last two also don't have an equivalent centralized organization like the gema (as far as I know!?), and do the licensing of their work, just like developers, on their own.",0,1399823846,null,0,false,0,chf7y47,t3_2573sx,t1_chf7y47,t1_chf7fti,null,1433748815,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

Gewalt ist ein gesellschaftliches Problem und es gibt nun mal Gesellschaften, die aus diversen Gründen gewaltätitger sind als andere.

Deshalb sollte man nicht auch noch Waffen in Gebiete liefern, in denen es ohnehin jede Menge Gewaltpotenzial gibt.

Waffenhändler tragen sehr wohl eine Mitverantwortung. 

&gt;z.B. in Schweiz und Österreich ist die Schusswaffenquote pro Einwohner viel höher, trotzdem haben diese Länder eine niedrige Unfall/Gewaltverbrechenrate mit Schusswaffen.

Die Schweiz hat weniger Großstädte, weniger Armut, eine homogenere Gesellschaft usw. usf. Das sind alles Faktoren, welche Gewalt *insgesamt* verringern. Wenn die Schlussfolgerung aus einem Vergleich ein allgemeiner Bezug sein soll, braucht man für die Dinge, die man vergleicht, die selben Voraussetzungen. Man hat aber nicht die gleichen Voraussetzungen, wenn man friedliche kleine Dörfer mit Großstadtghettos vergleicht.

Lol, no

&gt; More seriously, is there some kind of popular country music scene in Europe that I haven't noticed in almost 3 years here? Or is the song popular because it is different and new?

Not really, I think it's more that country/western is a bit novel for eurovision, something other than the endless ballads and europop. 

Other than that, taste is not absolute and though I'm sure country produces a large amount of kitschy crap, there's probably good stuff to be found as well. 

I'm personally not a big fan of country, but I do enjoy the music the eurovision singer has made and given that that's classed as country I apparently like at least some country.

* Les liens entre pouvoir économique et pouvoir politique, notamment comment les titres de presse appartiennent à de grands groupes privés
* Un questionnement sur le statut de ""spécialiste"" à la télévision notamment ces économistes qui affichent leur statut universitaire et pas leur position dans de grands conseils d'administration, posant encore une fois la question du conflit d'intérêt.

If it were a non-bearded lady singing that same exact song, putting on that same exact act, she probably would've placed somewhere between 4th and 6th place. However, because it was a ""face of tolerance"" which did so, it automatically got support from the majority of nations.

Eurovision is supposed to be about the best song/act, not the best message or background. I respect Conchita for doing what she does, but I think she played the system by choosing to promote a topic that everybody knows has a lot of traction among Europeans, and especially among Eurovision-watching demographics. The song was good, but not first-place good.

Notice how the articles about her victory today aren't even about her song or performance, but about the message it sends. If the projection of tolerance is the primary objective of a competition, there should just be a Eurovision exclusively of LGBT. I was appalled by the politicizing of yesterday's event.

And then the jury of Georgia. All five jurors had exactly the same Top 7. They were disqualified and only the televoters were counted. Which is why Georgia is the only country in that corner from which Austria got 10 points. In Armenia and Aserbaidschan the people also liked Austria quite a bit, but the jurys did the same to her as the UK did to Poland and Belgium did to Armenia.

[A fair amount of Russia’s military is still in a woeful state, but enormous increases in the defence budget have improved equipment, training and readiness.Five years ago, Russia staged huge military manoeuvres on NATO’s borders — next door to Poland, and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2624817/How-Putins-walking-Six-years-ago-EDWARD-LUCAS-branded-scaremonger-warning-danger-posed-West-today-threats-alarming-ever.html)

**Western military officials were aghast when intelligence reports came in of the scenario for that exercise. Russia was rehearsing the invasion and occupation of the Baltic states. It also carried out a dummy nuclear attack on Warsaw.**

**Last year, when it repeated the exercise, Western military observers were deeply alarmed by the huge improvements in Russia’s ability to move large quantities of men and equipment long distances in a short space of time. While Russia has been investing massive sums in its military, NATO has been cutting its defence spending.**

Russia did not send any troops to Ukraine. There is no evidence at all telling that the military groups in the Ukraine belonged to Russia, only words and cheap tricks from the propagandic western media &amp; their politics. If you do have evidence please provide it, don't include sites such as BBC and other manipulated media. Use independent sources please. 

The votes were not rigged. One more lie taken from western media which doesn't show nor tell the peoples who are living there their opinions and view on the matter. If there were people against joining Russia it, why isn't western media showing or writing about them then? That's right, because people there are not against it. 

Biggest bullshit from the western media, 'eastern terrorists'. What is happening in the eastern parts of Ukraine right now: People living there are protesting against the nazi government in Kiev and does not want to be ruled by them. The Ukrainian government is illegitimate right now, they took the power by violence and not by democratic elections. That government has forced their army to the eastern parts of Ukraine to 'stop' peacefull protestors and their elections and protests. Once they got there, they did not shoot or kill any protestans, they turned around or switched sides because they didn't want to use their guns against their own people. Did western media write about it? No. Now that the Ukranian government realised that the army won't shoot against it's own people they gave weapons to the Nazis. Look what is happening in Ukraine right now. Many peacefull citizens are getting shot, killed, tortured.. All because of USA and EU supporting the Nazis. 

'Now Russia arms eastern terrorists and is responsible for dozens dead.'

This was by far the most stupid shit I ever read. I feel bad for you, being all brainwashed by western media. Go find some videos on internet where you can see a bunch of civilians (aka eastern terrorists or prorussian separatists as the western media would call them) getting killed, burned alive by the Ukrainian military forces.

- Do visit the typical tourist sites, because there are some places you just have to see at least once in your life, but try to do it differently. The Vatican museums (which you absolutely need to see no matter what) have [night openings](http://biglietteriamusei.vatican.va/musei/tickets/do?action=booking&amp;codiceLivelloVisita=17&amp;step=1) which I strongly recommend because they are far less crowded and far more intimate than visiting during regular hours. You **must** book online for the night openings, which I advise doing even for a day ticket.

- The museums in Florence have night openings as well.

- In Naples, I always advise people to visit the Naples National Archaeologic Musem (MANN), which has an impressive collection of Roman and Greek artifacts including most of the most iconic Pompeii wall paintings. It doesn't get as many visitors as it should because its marketing team is a bit understaffed.

- If you can fit it in your schedule, a day trip from Naples or Sorrento to Pompeii is very much worth it. The Pompeii area (Pompeii, Herculaneaum and Stabia) is the only place in the world where you can walk *inside* a Roman city frozen in time, and experience you can have nowhere else.

- **Always** ask locals for recommendations on food. Never ever trust Tripadvisor reviews on restaurants, especially in tourist areas there are simply far too many people who know nothing about food but give glowing reviews to undeserving places.

And the second drawback is also the final benefit: politicians can't devalue the currency at will. Thus, their expending binges are reduced but they also can't freely implant stimulus measures.

The norm with tour groups is that they try to pack as much stuff as possible in the time available; you generally don't have team to freely roam about and explore places, you have to stay on schedule. The value proposition of a tour is that it organizes everything for you and provides a guide to show you around places; if you are not scared of setting up your own itinerary you don't need the first, and in my experience the quality of the tour guides is very poor in terms of accuracy of information, language skills and communication skills. 

I wouldn't recommend them for somebody who can organize their own trips, especially in a modern country where it's not hard to look up everything you need on the internet and you don't need to fear unforeseen problems (i.e. it's good to have a guide if you are touring the Sahara desert, but you don't face the same risks as travelling through a heavily urbanized first world country).",0,1399832215,null,0,false,0,chfb2s2,t3_2598gm,t1_chfb2s2,t3_2598gm,null,1433750355,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

There is no such thing as ""the far left"". There are different trends of far left in different countries. Infact since 1968, most of the far-left in Europe started being anti-USSR. Supporting USSR was the miniority and the French Parti Communiste was one of the few who still did. Most Marxist parties in Europe supported Maoism or Leninism.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurocommunism

I'll add that today, the Parti Communiste in France and virtually all Western European far left parties are Euro-Communist and very against USSR and they will have no reason to support modern day Russia which is not even Socialist anyways. 

And the link above does not even give examples of how the left is pro-putin. All it says is that its against the EU policy on the conflict

true,Naurgul,null,null,"Disclaimer: I knew next to nothing about economics before the crisis. The most succinct summary I can give of the effects is the following:

* Trade becomes easier as businesses don't have to take changing interest rates into account when planning imports/exports. It's one trade barrier removed, which can be both good and bad, because it might hurt local industry or allow you to out-compete some foreign industry you weren't able to so far.  
* If your old currency is more inflationary than the euro, you will enjoy a period of easy credit, which can be both a good and bad thing. It will raise living standards but will sap the competitiveness out of your economy as wages (and prices) will rise. 
* The euro does not have a surplus recycling mechanism, which is something ""normal"" currency unions have. It means that when there is an ""asymmetric shock"" there is nothing to help stabilise the situation except internal devaluation. Some people say that monetary/fiscal intervention is ""the easy way out"" and therefore it shouldn't be done, but you have to remember that this is an ideological position, not an objective fact that everyone agrees on. 

I think most economists agree that in the long term the euro cannot work without a surplus recycling mechanism (e.g. fiscal transfers!) and mostly everyone agrees that this is politically infeasible right now. Which means that either the euro will stay and will cause a slow-burning recession and/or deflation for a long time or it will dissolve causing a ton of economic damage. 

For countries outside the eurozone, if you think the structural deficits of the euro I described above are important (and believe me, they are), there is fortunately a middle-ground solution. You can peg your currency to the euro. If things get better you can convert your money easily and if things go shitty you can break the peg while escaping the worst of the economic damage. Denmark is doing this and it seems like a good middle-ground solution to me.

Another great place to visit is the ""Eisbach"". It's more of an inside tip, a lot of locals know. Contrary to ""Neuschwanstein"" a famous castle 90 minutes away.

If you go shopping, in the center of the city, make sure tp climb up the ""Alter Peter"", an old church that gives you an amazing view over munich. I think it costs about 1 euro.
Buy a ""Döner Kebap"", they are seriously awesome. Also make sure to check out the beer. The city is known for the big breweries like Augustiner, Paulaner and Hacker-Pschorr.

Man kann das Argument auf fast alles anwenden, was legal geregelt wird. 

&gt;Du vergisst hoffentlich, weiszt aber wahrscheinlich gar nicht, dasz wir die beiden Handelsgueter nicht im luftleeren Raum vergleichen. Menschenhandel ist international geaechtet, da gibt es kein Vertun: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking#Current_international_treaties_.28general.29

&gt;Wurden wir um der Diskussion willen also annehmen, dass neben Waffen- auch Menschenhandel in Deutschland praktiziert werden wuerde, dann wurde letzteres, aber nicht ersteres gegen geltendes internationales Recht verstoszen. Du kannst dir ja mal ueberlegen woran das liegt. Vielleicht etwa daran, dasz Waffen benoetigt werden? Zum Beispiel um die Polizei zu bewaffnen? Oder zu Jagen?

Das ist doch alles vollkommen irrelevant für das, was ich dir gerade gesagt habe. Ich weiß nicht, wie ich es dir noch leichter machen soll. Zu sagen, dass man etwas in Land X nicht verbieten sollte, weil man es auch in Land Y machen kann, ist absurd. Man verbietet etwas, weil man es für falsch hält und etwas Falsches wird nicht auf wundersame Weise besser dadurch, dass es irgendwo auf der Welt praktiziert werden kann. Egal ob es nun um Menschenhandel, Verkauf von Waffen in Spannungsgebiete, oder rituellen Mord geht - nur weil man es anderswo machen kann, sollte es deswegen nicht auch hier möglich sein. 

&gt;Im Endeffekt hast du dich also selbst ""ad absurdum"" gefuehrt. Du solltest uebrigens noch mal nachlesen, was das bedeutet, und wie man das Argument fuehrt.

Too bad. When you finance them and gladly use the services they offer, you're aiding them and voluntarily making use of their potentially ill-gained goods, and you're damn well responsible for that. 

&gt;But how could the average russian have any influence on their current politics. Sadly, that is a bit unrealistic.

Are they incapable of organising demonstrations? Strikes? Mass refusals to pay taxes? Emigration? Disowning the nation as a whole and disliking it with the rest of us?

&gt; If such a behavior we saw at the song contest would be directed against your country, you wouldn't take it too well.
I would like to think I'd have jumped ship before my country (and/or the EU) descends to that level.


Sure, it is probably unrealistic to demand this, because people everywhere are lazy cowards who all too easily wash their hands of the suffering of others, but that doesn't mean it isn't *right*. True, booing singers probably won't incite them to make the Good choice - denouncing Russia's actions on live international television - but that doesn't mean they aren't responsible for not speaking up when they had the opportunity.

1. capital mobility (Eurozone has this),
2. labor mobility (people move from places with bad economy to places with better economy),
3. similar business cycles (each country has recessions and booms at the same time),
4. automatic risk sharing (for example common fiscal policy like in US where federal benefits even out the downturns in states that are not doing well).

Eurozone has only capital mobility and it's very suboptimal currency region. When countries that have differently structured economies than the biggest economy (Germany) go out of the sync with Germany, they will have worse  time than without euro.  On the other hand Germany benefits from this. Euro has value that reflects the sum of the economies in eurozone. From German viewpoint euro is weaker than it should be and it helps German exports. For most other countries euro is stronger than it should be and it harms their exports. 

To solve this issue, Eurozone must either dissolve or integrate more strongly. Current situation can't last forever. I don't know what would be the best solution, but it looks like Eurozone will end up having common fiscal policy in some way or another.

Yo recuerdo que despues de la primera guerra del golfo hubo levantamientos civiles contra saddam pensando que occidente vendria a ayudarles a deroccarlo y occidente paso olimpicamente de meterse ahi, saddam massacro a miles de personas, y no era la primera vez, uso armas quimicas contra los Kurdos y opositores, 

Afganistan desde la subda de los Talibanes todo el mundo pedia que se interviniera para parar la forma en que los Talibanes trataban a las mujeres y a los no islamicos, cuando destruian cualquier rasgo de cultura ajena al islam como los buddas de Bamiyanm, 

Pero al final como los que entraron fueron los ""yankies de mierda"" derepente toda la izquierda que estaba clamando contra los talibanes y sus abusos de poder para imponer su islam estricto se callaron como putas porque era la Otan y EEUU quien entraron a luchar como ellos, y derepente para la izquierda los malvados destructores de cultura y maltratadores de mujeres se convirtieron en un pobre pueblo oprimido por EEUU. 

Saddam y los Talibanes han tradato a sus pueblos bastante pero que Khaddafi o Assad, y el peligro de intervenir en Siria es mayor que en Afganistan y dejaria el pais como esta ahora Iraq, en caos total en manos de bandas sectarias cada uno poniendo bombas para imponer su ley.

The ones you crossed out - if someone's going to be at a train station taking photos of ticket machines they may as well grab a shot of the platform too, so you could probably have left them un-struck through.

Most of the images can be taken around Montparnasse, in case anyone is interested in doing that... I'd say pretty much all of them, except maybe the scam category, and for those you'd need to go to somewhere like the Eiffel Tower or the Louvre.

Basically my gripe is that my hobby involves a fair amount of photography (I have a food blog). The number of people who write to me to say ""hey, can I use your photographs for free in print?"" is staggering. They assume that having attribution is payment enough because ""hey, maybe a couple of people will visit my site as a result"".

It's *my* work - just as this will be the artistic work of whoever takes the photos. Not only that, but the kind of photos you're requesting are generic ""stock photo"" kind of shots. Exactly the kind of thing the photographer could upload to istockphoto or some such site, license out and earn significantly more, perhaps even *per photo*, than what you're offering.

""Hey it's just paper and a bit of ink!"", so why not pay the person supplying photography a fair amount, especially since you're going to, presumably, be selling these books of yours and making money off the work of others.

Sorry to rant - it's just a subject close to my heart.

true,imnotrelevanttothis,,78 wesh ma gue-... wait,"&gt; Should I buy a metro pass now before my trip (site to buy it on would help me) or should we buy there?

As far as I'm concerned, there is nowhere online you can buy tickets. Take in mind as well that there are quite a few options on what you can actually buy to travel on public transport (Tickets T+, Paris visite ^(not recommended by some though), Mobilis, Tickets Jeune, etc...). In the end, what you get will depend on the length, dates of your trip, and sometimes your age (whether you come at the start of a week for a ticket jeune if you're under 25^? , if it's the holidays, etc...). For all this, just buy them when you get here, and take in mind that it's a more expensive ticket from either of the airports to Paris than actual Metro (T+) tickets (although if you arrive to any train station, you're already in Paris, so you're good). 

&gt; Should we buy the Museum Pass? Places we plan on visiting: Louvre, Musee D'Orsay (sorry if I mispelled), Norte Dame, catacombs, arc de triomphe, pantheon (maybe a few others if time permits)

Take in mind a few factors, both positive and negative, before buying it.

Positively,

* You get easy access to most museums, loads which are incredibly worth it
* In some places, I would believe you can skip queues, but don't trust me too much on that one.
* If you're on a intense museum-visiting-learning trip, this is your pass

However,

* Judging by the places you plan on going to, you're technically only going to 3 museums that require a museum pass (I think), which would make you pay more than you're actually using it
* If you're younger than 26 and a European, you're free in most museums and &gt;18 go in free in most places as well, even if you aren't European. 
* [There's a secret door in the Louvre called the *Porte des Lions* where you can get your tickets without queuing](http://www.umr171-cnrs.fr/IMG/jpg/c2rmf_planlouvre.jpg) ^(closed on Fridays, so watch out)

I honestly have no idea. In any case, I'd also recommend to buy everything for Versailles before, and to take a tour as they explain **everything**, 80% of which you'll miss without the guide.
