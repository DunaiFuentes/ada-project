Maybe if you're Anglo. To most of the rest of us it's something that's been shoved on us in living memory.

Homogeneity does tend to be a desirable aspect in a stable and safe society, yes. People that can all agree that rape is terrible for instance. I realize that this notion is very troublesome to some out there.

&gt;I have lived in cities that place on different regions of the ""diversity"" chart in different countries

So you're an international nomad. Most of Europe is made up of sedentary communities that won't just run to the next country when the effects of ""diversity"" shows up in their daily life and the crime statistics.

&gt;I like meeting people that have done/seen/thought things I would have never thought of

And of course the best way to do that is to force every country to become their living place. Every country should become the same rootless timeshare space for internationals. This will truly make way for a great deal of diverse opinions and won't at all turn the very birthplaces of those differing cultures into shallow copies of London and NYC.

&gt;and criminality can unfortunately be linked to immigration, but it is also true in any monocultural society that has its own inequalities.

Nowhere near the same in violence and magnitude thankfully.

true,_delirium,DENK,Denmark,"It depends on what level you mean, but I think the Nordic countries may also fall into the category of significant cultural change. The past century of social democracy, peacefulness, and egalitarianism is historically a fairly recent phenomenon. For centuries the Nordic countries were extremely feudal, with a rather ruthless nobility, constant wars, and masses of poor peasantry (and later, urban workers) oppressed by the upper classes.

In Finland's case, the turning point was the 1918 civil war, where in a sense both sides ""lost"". Both sides tied their fortunes to what turned out to be embarrassing allies: the workers and peasants allied with the nascent Bolsheviks, who shortly turned out to not look so good, while the nobility allied with the German Kaiser, who also shortly lost his charm (and throne). The rising role of Finnish (the language of the lower classes) vs. Swedish (the language of the nobility) also helped smooth over the previous power imbalances: the ""Swedish"" (White) side won the civil war militarily, but in short order the ""Finnish"" (Red) side prevailed on the cultural question anyway.

In Denmark's case it was more gradual, but a commonly cited turning point is the [September 1899 compromise](http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/1999/08/feature/dk9908140f.htm) between the employer's federation and the labor/socialist movement. That inaugurated the modern labor-consensus model, which produced a lasting labor peace combined with a social welfare system.

&gt; People that can all agree that rape is terrible for instance. I realize that this notion is very troublesome to some out there.

Seriously? Diversity leads to rape? *Seriously?*

&gt; Most of Europe is made up of sedentary communities that won't just run to the next country when the effects of ""diversity"" shows up in their daily life and the crime statistics.

Most of 2014 Europe is made up of people who have themselves moved at least across the country they were born in and live where they have chosen to live.

&gt; And of course the best way to do that is to force every country to become their living place.

No. I'm just explaining why I don't think ""diversity"" is a negative thing at all.

I don't think of Paris, London, Barcelone, Berlin or Bristol as ""rootless"" places.

&gt; you certainly don't come across as very unbiased yourself in proselytizing your desired cultural colonization as superior and the native people who want no part in it as ""retarded""

Obviously, if someone calls out on a ""liberal"" conspiracy that allegedly brainwashed me so that I don't recognise that diversity truly is nothing but negative, I can't help but thinking they have personal issues.

I said I can accept that some people don't think diversity is doing any good in their life. I just have to accept it because I see some people loathing it. I just can't accept people saying diversity is the root of all evil. There are cities that I think are shit places and are mostly so because of their refusal of accepting anything that comes from outside.

Homosexualism is the ideology, while homosexuality is the sexual deviation. This word is often used here, because it was used by our former president. In English-speaking countries the phrase ""gay agenda"" is used more often instead.

&gt;Seriously? Diversity leads to rape? Seriously?

Our crime statistics certainly speak for it. The capital had a police report that can be summarized as ""every single assault rape committed in the last five years were perpetrated by foreigners primarily of non-western origin"".

&gt;Most of 2014 Europe is made up of people who have themselves moved at least across the country they were born in and live where they have chosen to live.

And settle down there. They don't hop country from country nor do most of them have the luxury to leave when their home towns are ghettoized. 

&gt;I don't think of Paris, London, Barcelone, Berlin or Bristol as ""rootless"" places.

That's what they are. Mostly populated by people foreign to them and whose cultural creations are primarily from the past. Cities where you can spend your entire life without interacting with a person actually raised in that culture.

That's kind of interesting, and seems like a good strategy if true (I may be biased!). Overall I've viewed the Baltic countries as not being very friendly to the Nordic model, though they are culturally friendly to the Nordic countries. Instead, perhaps as part of a backlash against ""socialism"", I see them as preferring a more ""American"" approach on economics: low taxes to attract businesses and make things easy for the private sector, but also low government services, as a result of low tax revenue. From what I can find, Estonia's overall taxes account for only 32% of GDP, which is closer to the American level (27%) than to the Nordic levels (Denmark 50%, Sweden 47%, Finland 44%, Norway 44%).

Of course, tax rate is not everything.

A lot of the good jobs in Russia are in government run companies like Gazprom and Rosneft, Rusal etc. People literally risk losing their jobs and being blacklisted for anti-kremlin political activity. So this is one of the reasons you don't see as many people in the streets of Moscow as you did in Kiev - where you have oligarchs fighting amongst themselves and rampant corruption but you still have different political parties and different opinions, and not a single party / totalitarian system - which is clearly the direction Russia is taking. 

If we get to a level of sanctions that Iran recently experienced then those companies will suffer, badly. I'm not saying I'm for or against more sanctions - but I think that for Russians to overthrow Putin - given the cult of personality he has now, and the rise of nationalism and the return of cold war era anti-Western sentiment - you'll need to show people that he is a small man behind the curtain, just like in the wizard kf Oz.

&gt; That's what they are. Mostly populated by people foreign to them and whose cultural creations are primarily from the past. Cities where you can spend your entire life without interacting with a person actually raised in that culture.

That's a point on which I guess we'll never agree. All these places have different identities because they've had different stories because they were built and shaped by different people. There is no ""initial"" identity that places have because of their geographic coordinates and can be ruined by the existence of other people.

&gt; That's a much more pleasant way of handling it, rather than telling people to change to their country and way of life to suit your whims as most multicultural foreigners seem to prefer to.

Well, France is my country and it is very likely that life will take me there again, and like a majority of French I disagree with the vision that the FN has. To speak of the city I know best, Bordeaux is what it is because the region was English for a long time, the Dutch developed the wine production, the whole south west has had interactions with Spain and actually the language that was spoken there is a closer parent to Catalan than to current standard French. I know the identity of Bordeaux is the product of all that, centuries of cultural exchanges, not some identity that was given to Bordeaux on a marble tablet. There's pretty much always been a signficant part of the population who spoke a different language, in cities like Marseille or Barcelone it's even more true.

Do you consider Amsterdam a ""rootless"" place? I've never lived there but it sure feels like it has its own unique vibe to me. And a city like Bristol, UK, is a good example of how you can know where you're coming from and be glad you're going somewhere.

It's the idea that you have to protect your place against foreign influences that are assumed destructive that I reject. The idea that diversity is causing you to ""lose"" something. What did Paris lose because of ""diversity""? I don't advocate piling up unemployed immigrants in suburbian ghettos for the sake of feeling open-minded and embracing ""diversity"", but I have the feeling that fighting ""diversity"" is the wrong fight here.

&gt;The Trial Chamber found that Perišić oversaw the Yugoslav Army’s provision of extensive logistic assistance to the VRS and the SVK. Logistic assistance notably included vast quantities of infantry and 
artillery ammunition, fuel, spare parts, training and technical assistance. 

&gt;The Supreme Defence Council of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia granted Perišić and the Yugoslav Army the authority to provide logistic assistance to the VRS and SVK. Even though Perišić was not officially a member of the Supreme Defence Council, he participated in the Council’s meetings, along with its members, notably Slobodan Milošević and Zoran Lilić, who at that time held the titles of President of 
Serbia and President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, respectively. Perišić regularly urged the Council to continue providing logistic assistance to the VRS and SVK, insisting that they could not wage war without significant military support. 

&gt;A large number of VRS and SVK officers were drawn from the ranks of the Yugoslav Army. They officially remained members of the Yugoslav Army even as they were fighting in Bosnia and Croatia under the 
banners of the VRS and SVK. Perišić proposed and carefully implemented the idea of creating “Personnel Centres” to regularise the status of these officers and allow them to lawfully remain part of the Yugoslav Army. VRS officers retained their salaries and benefits as Yugoslav Army members through what was known as the 30th Personnel Centre, and SVK officers through the 40th Personnel Centre. Perišić was well aware that the payment of salaries was, in his own words, of “great help” to the VRS. 

&gt;Finally, the Chamber found that Perišić knew that the VRS’s operations encompassed grave crimes against civilians. Perišić received information from a variety of sources concerning the VRS’s criminal behaviour and discriminatory intent against Muslims. Under Perišić’s direction, the Yugoslav Army’s intelligence and security organs monitored the views of the international community and international media concerning the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Yugoslav Army General Staff also received diplomatic reports about proceedings at the United Nations Security Council concerning grave abuses against civilians in Sarajevo and other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In particular, Perišić was alerted to the fact that the VRS was conducting a campaign of sniping and shelling against civilians during its siege of Sarajevo. These regular attacks were well documented and widely reported for a period of three years. Perišić could not have reasonably discounted this information simply because he and his allies considered it biased against the Serbs. The fact that information was, in some instances, biased or one-sided does not undermine the finding that Perišić had notice of the VRS’s crimes in Sarajevo, namely murder, attacks on civilians and 
inhumane acts.

true,Kit_Emmuorto,vaticano,,"Discorso oscenamente vasto, provo ad andare di sintesi brutalissima.

Le teorie del complotto sul caso Moro sono più resistenti e penetranti della media in quanto figlie di un felicissimo (e raramente presente altrove) combinato disposto di due pulsioni: quella universale (per cui si diffida della verità ufficiale in quanto tale e si tende a cercarne una alternativa per elevarsi al di sopra dei pecoroni che si fanno star bene quello che l'autorità ha detto loro) e quella particolare (per cui elaborare teorie del complotto circa questo caso specifico assolve a funzioni di primaria importanza quali quelle consolatoria ed autoassolutoria). Lasciando da parte la prima (dove non si ha che la perpetuazione di schemi che si sono ripetuti uniformemente nel corso dei secoli, e la cui analisi pertanto nulla aggiungerebbe), sarà bene concentrarsi sulla seconda.

Chi (e perché) ha avuto interesse affinché la leggenda nera di Moro fatto fuori dalla Cia (o dal Kgb, o da tutti e due insieme in una sorta di larghe intese ante litteram) sorgesse e perseverasse nel tempo? Per prima la sinistra (termine di comodo che useremo per riferirci al Pci ed alle sue prospicienze accademico-culturali). Principale postulato delle teorie del complotto sul caso Moro è infatti quello che vede le Br come semplice braccio armato (inconsapevole o quasi della reale portata di ciò che veniva fatto) di un'operazione partorita da menti estranee e raffinatissime. Questo postulato rappresenta un tassello fondamentale nell'opera di attenuazione delle responsabilità morali e materiali dei brigatisti, opera che fin dall'inizio è stata molto a cuore ai comunisti: tramontata per manifesta ridicolaggine la teoria dei fascisti rossi e preso (nemmeno tanto serenamente) atto che quella gente veniva effettivamente dall'album di famiglia del Pci, per non trovarsi costretti ad ammettere di avere allevato una nidiata di tagliagole l'unica carta che resta alla sinistra è quella di dimostrare che i brigatisti sono stati le marionette in mano a burattinai (loro sì infami e assassini) che ne hanno biecamente strumentalizzato la buona fede ed i sani propositi di giustizia sociale per portare a compimento i loro oscuri piani golpisti. Discorso che fa a cazzotti con la storia, la cronaca giudiziaria e soprattutto la logica, ma che ciò nonostante è ancora presentissimo nel dibattito pubblico e lo sarà almeno fintanto che sarà viva l'ultima generazione di dirigenti di sinistra già operativi all'epoca (ovvero quelli che della dinamica autoassolutoria hanno bisogno per non dovere ammettere i propri fallimenti in materia).

Il secondo grande punto è quello che riguarda il compromesso storico. Più forte ancora dell'opinione comune per la quale Moro è stato fatto fuori dal Fodria è quella secondo cui obiettivo della congiura era stoppare sul nascere il compromesso storico, che in questa versione diventa l'intuizione di uno statista illuminato (Moro) che tutto a un tratto capisce che la soluzione ai mali dell'Italia è portare al governo il principale partito di opposizione (il Pci) perché, in ultima analisi, il compagno Berlinguer aveva sempre avuto ragione su un sacco di cose (da cui il piano controrivoluzionario delle potenze straniere che non potevano tollerare il sorgere del Sol dell'avvenire sulla portarei della Nato nel Mediterraneo e bla bla). Questa narrazione del compromesso storico - ovviamente - non sta né in cielo né in terra, ma non è questo il punto. Il punto è che, questa la premessa, si capisce perché questa opinione comune sia più forte di quella che precede. Lo è perché, rispetto ad essa, ha un promotore in più: ad avere convenienza dalla propagazione di questo mito, infatti, non sono solo i comunisti ma anche i democristiani. Perché lo abbiano fatto i comunisti è evidente: di fronte al fallimento della solidarietà nazionale e soprattutto (come diventerà chiaro di lì a poco tempo), di fronte al perfezionarsi del grande fallimento della segreteria Berlinguer, ai comunisti serve un capro espiatorio cui potersi attaccare per attenuare le proprie responsabilità. E cosa c'è di più conveniente della Spectre antidemocratica che soffoca nel piombo le conquiste dei lavoratori? Più sfumato il discorso che riguarda i democristiani, dove oltre a quello puramente politico entra in gioco un lato umano (si è trattato pur sempre di gente che, per la ragion di Stato o per che altro, ha dovuto lasciar morire ammazzato un amico di una vita). Soprattutto, nel caso dei democristiani, entra in gioco lo Stato. Ossia l'entità che più di ogni altra ha collezionato, durante il caso Moro, dimostrazioni di inefficienza, svarioni e figure di merda. E lo Stato erano i democristiani. I quali malvolentieri avrebbero ammesso di essere stati menati per il naso da una manica di dilettanti col mitra e ai quali la comparsa sulla scena della grande macchinazione dei poteri occulti fornisce invece il più inattaccabile degli alibi.

Detto di questo, resta da dire di Moro. La cui santinizzazione post mortem (risultante tra le altre cose nel pover'uomo fatto passare per [padre nobile dell'Ulivo con l'Unità sottobraccio](http://www.lettera43.it/upload/images/04_2011/l43-11040817390615_medium.jpg)) è un altro grande lavacro collettivo delle coscienze cui comunisti e democristiani hanno tutto l'interesse a partecipare. L'interesse dei comunisti è - di nuovo - quello di attenuare le proprie responsabilità politiche e di giustificare a posteriori il proprio fallimento mediante l'affermazione del principio secondo cui la mancata associazione alla gestione del potere e la susseguente ritirata in una irrilevanza quasi trentennale sono unicamente da imputare al complotto che ha fatto fuori questa specie di Mosè democratico che aveva appena iniziato a guidare il popolo eletto fuori dalla schiavitù dell'opposizione. L'interesse dei democristiani è quello di attenuare le proprie responsabilità personali (non c'era corrente del partito che non detestasse Moro che col 7% faceva il bello e il cattivo tempo) di fronte ad un evento tragico che li vedeva prima di tutti sul banco degli imputati (e ce li vedeva per chiamata di Moro stesso, vedi alla voce lettere dal carcere). Anche qui, poter spostare la responsabilità della brutta piega presa dagli eventi da se stessi ad un'entità misteriosa e non individuabile, può aiutare a non uscirne malissimo.

What would you like to do, exactly? Lodge a bullet in the skull of every single man, woman and child in Serbia? How many of you are jacking off to this idea right now?

My family in Bosnia was being shot at during the 90s. My cousin almost got picked by a Serb sniper when going out to pick up some milk, he was just a kid! His sister got a metal shard stuck in her head. Their dad got killed later on during the Bosnian wars by a mortar shell, probably a Serbian one... Ironically, my other cousin got drafted in Serbia to fight in Bosnia. Got shot just after leaving the bus by a sniper, was dead on the spot. My dad was almost drafted as well here in Serbia, but he was in CD so he managed to squeeze through.

My family in Croatia was in the middle of a crossfire in their village. Shells were coming down constantly, guns were a blazin'... my uncle's son got shot one time in his arm, the other time in his chest. Barely lived, still lives in constant pain today. Plenty of their neighbors got killed before they could reach the basement in time to hide from the stray mortars.

I was just a scared kid running with my parents throughout NATO's intervention during 1999. As a 12 year old, I got ""THE TALK"" from my father about the possibility of him going away and me probably never seeing him again. Sleepless nights, going numb to the sound of air raid sirens, listening to jets flying over, looking at explosions from my balcony before running down to hide... no electricity or running water... trying to get some information from an old AM radio... not being able to contact anybody to see if they're alright. Tanks were being dug in near my aunt's farm. I was just a kid though, so I had it alright. My Hungarian friend had to sleep in a ditch for months with his rifle, expecting an invasion which, thankfully, never came. His army barracks got blasted away just after he had left it with his battalion...

Most of you here are armchair war analysts who talk in terms of ""Croatia did that"", ""Serbia did this"", ""Bosnia did that""... Well, newsflash! That's not how this game is played! You are talking about entities consisting of millions of people, each with their own opinions and their own story! Every single part of my family has suffered throughout these wars, and if any of you dipshits even THINK you can comprehend how this all went down, you might as well stop now because you have no clue, and at least have the common courtesy to shut up and give your respect to those who are now rotting away in the ground for no reason whatsoever, while the politicians got away with it yet again.

&gt;Appreciate the extra info. And I completely understand that both sides were doing pretty awful things as well. But there seems to be a lot of Serbian apologists on this thread that minimize what Serbia did and amplify actions of NATO and the ethnic minorities. 

Yeah, people tend to get emotional about these things, especially because today is the anniversary of the beginning of the NATO bombing campaign. And while that doesn't excuse any kind of apologist rhetoric, the fact that most people probably aren't aware of the fact that the estimates are so wide and the civilian victims are not like 10 000A : 500S but probably more like 6500A : 3500S (I roughly took the averages and am no expert, just off the data on the English wiki - FWIW) speaks something about the argument that people tend to see the conflict a bit too black and white.

On the other hand, the USA is an outlier in many ways, both culturally and in terms of size (310 million people).

I was in Northern Iraq last winter and met *so many* Kurds whos lives were torn apart by Saddam Hussein. I am American, and considering the past few years, if Iraqis were going to blindly hate anyone, I would imagine it would be Americans. But I found the exact opposite. The Kurds were largely pro-US, and the Iraqi Arabs were typically not in favor of US intervention there, but didn't hold me personally accountable. And I certainly had no ill-will toward them. That being said, after I heard people's stories there I would say Saddam Hussein is lower than shit, and the world is better without him. I consider him and a few high ranking people to be responsible for what happened, not the average people.

Ça ne change pas grand chose aux possibilités d'adoption, tout en les rendant quand même plus facile mais puisque tu cites les excellents articles d'Eolas, voici un passage de celui que tu donnes en lien:

&gt; Voilà où se situe encore aujourd’hui l’inégalité que ce projet de loi se propose de faire disparaitre : les homosexuels n’ont pas accès au régime le plus protecteur, celui du mariage. Ils ont le choix entre deux statuts, le concubinage (qui est plus une absence de statut) et le PaCS, mais pas le mariage et sa batterie de mesures de protection, dont ils auraient eu un cruel besoin dans les années 80-90. Les couples de sexe différent ont le choix entre trois statuts. Ce point est de plus en plus difficile à contester. 

&gt; Aucun souvenir de ça non. De quels droits on parle ?

C'est précisé dans ton lien. Voici ce qu'on peut faire dans le cadre du mariage mais pas du PACS:

&gt; Votre conjoint ne paye jamais sa part des dépenses du couple alors qu’il gagne plus que vous car il a une passion pour le BASE Jumping en Ferrari ? Envoyez-lui la note. Il a vendu la maison où habite la famille, car il en est le seul propriétaire, pour financer sa passion ? Taratata, la vente est nulle : Article 215 alinéa 3 (s’applique aussi à la résiliation du bail). Lors de son dernier saut, le parachute ne s’est pas ouvert, il est plongé dans le coma ? Article 219 : vous pouvez tout signer pour lui. Il décède et n’a pas eu le temps de faire un testament pour vous protéger ? Pas de panique, vous êtes couvert. Et je ne parle pas du droit fiscal, matière qui a beaucoup changé ces dernières années, mais qui tend à favoriser les couples mariés (affirmation de moins en moins vraie, notamment par rapport aux couples pacsés). Sans attendre la Camarde, en cas de divorce, l’intervention obligatoire du juge vise à ce qu’un magistrat s’assure que les droits des époux soient respectés, notamment ceux du conjoint le plus faible, économiquement ou physiquement : le juge peut refuser de prononcer un divorce par consentement mutuel léonin, et inviter les parties à modifier leur accord sur tel ou tel point (dans l’hypothèse d’un divorce pour faute, il fixe directement les conséquences du divorce).

&gt; I will say, this conflict seems to be one of the less understood conflicts by Westerners despite happening right in the EU's back yard. It is kind of odd considering its proximity.

It's not really odd. Nobody really wants to look at it because everybody comes out as bad. Do you think people in NATO countries would really want to face the fact that they didn't stop ethnic cleansing but simply reversed it while their own forces were looking on? And that the new political leadership of Kosovo is heavily involved in organized crime including the sale of organs from murdered Serbs.

Bicameralism. I wouldn't set the US as much of an example of democracy, and certainly not their senate. I'm also extremely sceptical in general about territories having representation. The German federal council wouldn't please me much as a solution. That said...

If one wants bicameralism to mean something then the Senate has to have actual powers. And, behold! The Constitution makes it so that with remarkably free exceptions the Senate's only power is to delay. Arts 74.2, 81.2, 86.2, 89.2-3 etc. In fact in ordinary laws the senate can only delay by 2 months, and 20 days if congress or the cabinet declare the project urgent. So if what you want is a senate that means anything the constitution definitely doesn't give you that. The only cases where I think it has any real power are to determine the necessity for a framework law (ley marco) or to suspend autonomy.

Regarding provinces. Even if a minimum of 1 were set it would harm proportionality for the small ones, which in proportionality probably shouldn't get any. The objection to the province as district is that it's fairly arbitrary. I'd much rather have a single national district as we get for Europarl.

The territorial model. Independently of whether it was followed, it's a really messy and complex model. You won't see anything like it on any other state, I think. At first it looks like a dual list system, but art 148 had an expiry date of 5 years. So there's just a list of things the autonomous communities can't do, except when they can and inasmuch as they can depending on the TC's mood that day. Really, really messy. I'll point out I'm more of a centralist and I'd rather have only normative powers vested in the central state, but even (or perhaps especially!) if one is a federalist one can't be very satisfied with the arrangement either.

The monarchy is more of a political problem than it looks because of art 56.3. How do we know the monarchy hasn't been using its inviolability, say, to evade taxes, help in corruption or money laundering operations, or similar? Whenever an investigation touches the king it has to stop, by law.

Overpowered executive. I don't think the alternatives are as you describe them. The British Parliament is very clearly pre-eminent in comparison to the cabinet, and we don't see constant instability. The instability in Belgium results from the complexities produced by having what effectively are two different political establishments in one country, and Italy just doesn't have strong majorities, which under our constitution isn't really sorted out since if a president is not invested for a while the Cortes must be dissolved. I'm sceptical of the whole power given to the executive in the form of decree-laws; constructive motion of censure; the inability for the Cortes to approve a specific cabinet or changes to it, or separte its members; the executive's privilege in legislative initiative, very particularly in the area of tax receits and outlays; the fact that neither motion of censure nor resignation dissolve the Cortes (which I think they should); the executive's power to declare state of alarm for 15 days without Congress; its power to appoint and give instructions to the general prosecutor, or appoint members of the TC.

Finally, regarding modifications of the constitution, one can have different degrees of rigidity. The German constitution gets touched a lot more without too much obvious harm. That said, I admit I'm not partial to rigid constitutions at all and would prefer the people's sovereign organ to have more room to manoeuvre, while also admitting the results of something like this given our politicians might not be great, but on the other hand maybe people would be more careful of absolute majorities in that case. The special protection to the Crown in the procedure is also not ideal, as the fact art 14 isn't included in the extraordnary procedure (if we're going to have it we may as well protect the important bits).

&gt;**The majority of pacifists either belong to obscure religious sects or are simply humanitarians who object to taking life and prefer not to follow their thoughts beyond that point.** But there is a minority of intellectual pacifists, whose real though unacknowledged motive *appears to be hatred of western democracy and admiration for totalitarianism.* Pacifist propaganda usually boils down to saying that *one side is as bad as the other*, but if one looks closely at the writing of the younger intellectual pacifists, one finds that **they do not by any means express impartial disapproval** but are directed almost entirely against **Britain and the United States**. Moreover they do not as a rule condemn violence as such, but only *violence used in defence of western countries.* The Russians, unlike the British, are not blamed for defending themselves by warlike means, and indeed **all pacifist propaganda of this type avoids mention of Russia or China.** It is not claimed, again, that the Indians should abjure violence in their struggle against the British. Pacifist literature abounds with equivocal remarks which, if they mean anything, **appear to mean that statesmen of the type of Hitler are preferable to those of the type of Churchill,** and that *violence is perhaps excusable if it is violent enough.* After the fall of France, the **French pacifists, faced by a real choice which their English colleagues have not had to make, mostly went over to the Nazis,** and in England there appears to have been some *small overlap of membership between the Peace Pledge Union and the Blackshirts.* **Pacifist writers have written in praise of Carlyle, one of the intellectual fathers of Fascism.** All in all it is difficult not to feel that pacifism, as it appears among a section of the intelligentsia, ***is secretly inspired by an admiration for power and successful cruelty.***",0,1395716025,null,0,false,0,cgb659j,t3_217rbu,t1_cgb659j,t3_217rbu,null,1433055586,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

These tapes prove only that Russia is capable of listening phone-calls and/or is buying this stuff from other agencies/phone companies. And then using it as a propaganda tool.

The one thing they (Putin/FSB) don't understand that in Europe people hate this kinda surveillance and shit and are capable to see through that. Russia is making itself looking much more dirty than NSA. 

These methods may work in Russia. But here this only makes Tymoshenko look much better. She might even know that this will happen and used that language to show Ukrainians that she is with them and ready to defend her country and people.

This one is pretty famous. It's tradition to hike up to the Kloster (abbey) Andechs and drink a Mass (liter) of this beer up there.

This shop actually has quite a huge collection and some of my favourites aswell. Expensive but as a one time thing for tasting definitly affordable. I'll just list some in case you want to order and need some help deciding:

Au-delà, l'extrême-gauche à 10% dans plein de listes : ah, cool. Enfin, ce n'est pas comme si l'ensemble des partis qu'il avait derrière le Front de Gauche n'était pas en effondrement lent depuis un bail, a toujours des problèmes d'alliance avec la gauche (dans le sens : la question se pose, s'est posé, et ce fut le cas lors de ces élections municipales avec des alliances PCF), etc.

On parle de la *montée* du Front National avec des scores *historiques* selon beaucoup de monde. Pour retrouver ce qui fut la grandeur des partis d'extrême-gauche d'autrefois, Mélenchon va avoir du boulot.

Il y a aussi le côté ""anti-système"" qui joue beaucoup. 

C'est affreux de dire ça, mais Le Pen a raison lorsqu'elle affirme que les médias comme les hommes politiques de gauche/droite ont peur du Front National parce qu'ils représentent la ""seule"" grande alternative. Le FN fait flipper ; les mecs refusent toute alliance à l'échelle nationale, continue de grimper comme des bourrins, méprisent ouvertement les autres partis et continuent d'avancer.  MLP comme d'autres dans son parti sont totalement ""hors du jeu"" médiatique et politique ; ils n'ont pas traîné dans les Ministères comme Mélenchon, n'ont pas d'alliés bien établis chez ceux qui font la France aujourd'hui (donc n'ont rien à perdre personnellement à les brusquer), etc. 

Personnellement, je trouve ça tragique ce qui arrive à l'extrême-gauche sous Mélenchon. Un affaiblissement réel de la portée de l'alternative qu'il représente, selon moi. Mais je me trompe sûrement, hein. Peut-être que Mélenchon est sur une pente ascendante... enfin j'attends de voir les statistiques précises à ce sujet. Lors des dernières présidentielles, il avait surtout regroupé les extrêmes à gauche, sans pour autant les faire beaucoup progresser. Et on l'avait beaucoup exposé à l'époque (qu'il s'en plaigne pas !), tout comme MLP. Quelques années plus tard, j'ai l'impression qu'un des deux a progressé et pas l'autre.

Mélenchon, y'a moins de vingt ans, on le voyait cracher sur les petits partis présentant des candidats aux présidentielles, lors du passage au second tour de Le Pen. Désormais on le voit avec une alternative mi-gauche classique, mi-extrême-gauche, en train de diluer ce qui faisait les ""extrêmes"" de l'extrême-gauche dans un programme commun. Son programme n'effraie pas grand' monde, à part quelques membres de la très haute bourgeoisie qui y croiraient encore. Et surtout, tout le monde sait qu'il pourrait faire alliance pour le pouvoir.

Euh... elle a pas été élue il me semble. Alors que le risque d'abstention de l'électorat de gauche à cause des disputes entre les deux candidats PS était grand. Oui, il aurait pu remporter une grande victoire médiatique ce jour là, mais dire qu'il s'est viandé alors qu'il a peut-être bien réussi à empêcher l'élection de Marine Le Pen, c'est un peu dur. 

Une des stats que je trouve intéressante, et une analyse que je ne retrouve nulle part, c'est que le front de gauche, à plein d'endroits, fait liste commune avec EELV, parfois contre des listes PS. Ça fait un moment qu'ils se reniflent le derrière. Or, quand tu additionnes les voix d'EELV et du front de gauche, tu obtiens plus que le FN. 

Alors en effet, si tu classes EELV comme étant alignés sur le PS, le front de gauche reste assez petit, en 4e position. Par contre si tu considères que EELV est un parti à la gauche du PS, et bien dans ce cas là, on est en droit de se demander pourquoi on parle uniquement de la montée de l'extrême droite alors que la montée de l'opposition de gauche est aussi importante. 

Et je doute que le FN fasse peur aux grands partis. Depuis 2002, ils le voient comme un repoussoir très utile. J'ai vraiment l'impression que Hollande rêve d'une élection en 2017 contre un candidat UMP qui aurait du mal à battre Marine Le Pen.

Je n'ai pas affirmé qu'elle avait été élue. Elle était passée devant lui.

Parce que les élections municipales actuelles font douter pas mal de monde sur l'utilité réelle du FN en faveur de la gauche gouvernementale, par exemple.

Mélenchon a eu son instant de gloire lors des dernières présidentielles, et on continue de le faire intervenir régulièrement dans les médias. Son obsession par rapport au Front National est contre-productive. Si le Front de Gauche progresse à un tel point, il faut avancer des arguments en faveur de cette thèse. S'il compare juste le Front de Gauche, assemblage de partis dont certains collectaient autrefois à la chaîne des villes, au Front National en disant ""regardez !

La confusion vient de ce qu'il y a en fait deux FN: le vieux, à Papa Le Pen, et le nouveau, à Fifille Le Pen.

Jean Marie Le Pen (le Papa) a plusieurs condamnation, est considéré (à tort, diront ses amis) d'être un raciste. Beaucoup se souviennent qu'il a été condamné pour apologie de crime de guerre et que des anciens collaborateurs voire des groupes neo-nazi supportaient ouvertement son parti. Cependant, ceux qui connaissaient ce parti ont du mal à reconnaître le FN ""nouveau""

Marine Le Pen a commencé ce que les médias ont appelé une ""dédiabolisation"", c'est à dire un nettoyage du parti pour lui donner une image plus respectable. Dehors donc les nazis un peu trop effrayant. Même si on lui a vu des sympathies pour certains groupes skinheads, il est désormais un motif d'exclusion de revendiquer publiquement des idées un peu trop extrêmes au FN. 

Marine Le Pen a elle même affirmé que son parti [n'est pas d'extrême droite](http://www.lesechos.fr/02/10/2013/lesechos.fr/0203041340805_pour-marine-le-pen--le-fn-n-est-pas-un-parti-d-extreme-droite.htm), récusant l'étiquette. Ils essayent d'être considérés comme un parti de droite normal. Et il faut dire que sur certaines questions, comme le mariage homosexuel, ils ont eu une attitude beaucoup plus modéré que le parti de droite ""classique"". Leur seul maire élu à cette heure est homosexuel.

Pour résumer:

&gt; Le Front National est littéralement composé de nazis

Non. Même s'il y en a eu sous Papa Le Pen, le Front National n'a jamais été un parti nazi. Pour la bonne raison que si c'était le cas, il serait interdit. On peut toujours l'accuser d'arrières pensées et de ne faire que présenter une façade respectable, mais beaucoup de ses supporters croient honnêtement qu'il n'est pas si extrême que ça.


&gt; Les partis de droites nord-américains sont beaucoup plus à droite que le Front National.

Je ne sais pas trop ce que ça veut dire ""à droite du front national"". Ceci dit, on peut lister quelques différences : je pense que le front national accorde à la religion moins d'importance que le parti républicain. Internationalement, le FN veut sortir de l'OTAN et s'allier avec la Russie. Par contre ils sont probablement assez alignés sur les histoires de préférence nationale et de défense de la langue. Sur la politique de répression également. 

Il est difficile de savoir ce que ferait le FN au pouvoir, mais je crois qu'aucun parti plus modéré que le FN n'aurait accepté une chose comme Guantanamo.

À l'origine, le FN est un parti classiste (Le Pen père se voulait être le Reagan français, sachant que Reagan c'est des slogans comme « remettre au travail les mendiants du système de protection sociale »), sexiste (militant, en gros, pour un retour de la femme dans la cuisine et contre les droits reproductifs), homophobe et raciste.

Maintenant ils sont dans une stratégie d'accès au pouvoir alors c'est tout de suite plus compliqué d'afficher sa haine de tout le monde quand on espère recevoir des suffrages. Du coup, on fait machine arrière sur le libéralisme, on prétend s'inquiéter du bien être des femmes (surtout pour stigmatiser les extrémistes musulmans dont on oublie, au passage, systématiquement de préciser ""extrêmiste"" et même si on compte toujours les renvoyer dans la cuisine par le biais du salaire de femme au foyer) et on balance quelques doses d'[homonationalisme](https://negreinverti.wordpress.com/tag/homonationalisme/) toujours pour faire progressiste et tailler sur les musulmans.

The mainstream - politicians and media - basically say ""I won't talk with you, filthy nazi"". That forces voters basically to not stay neutral but to either really hate these guys or suppport them.

Add to the fact that in many nations the Left has basically abandonded the ""white"" working class. Not only by subscribing to austerity, but there is a _cultural_ trend of the idea of Leftism being taken over by rich Oxford guys, champagne socialists and the like. This began with the New Left movements of 1968 - they were clearly not a working class thing, the student barricades... the point is, the ""white"" working class man is socially, if not conservative, then at least modernate. While he may not openly oppose anti-racism, gay rights or feminism, he does not get very excited by them either. So the Left, focusing on these, abandons them.

Thus, slowly, the ""white"" working class party is these kinds of right-populists. 

Sooner or later, when they get popular enough, the Left or the mainstream will have to accept the views of the  voters, but why wait until they get too popular? Why keep resisting it when it is futile? The first thing to do would be to stop demonizing them and accept that they represent a significant chunk of the people whose chunk feels they have actual problems the populists can respond to.

A thing about the names, *Thelka* sounds weird, couldn't it be **Thekla** instead? That's a old german name.

Couldn't it be **Carl Ludwig**? That's the german version, and while it's possible that his name was Charles, I don't think it was.
*Ludvig* is possible since the area kind of belonged to Denmark back then, but *Lud**w**ig* would be the german version.

It is one of the oldest professions and I assume, traditions and knowledge about ""alternative"" medicine are a very impotant factor of their work. But since universities of applied sciences have created oportunities to get a bachelor's degree in midwifery, science enters and matters as well. Plus, midwifes have the duty to get coached regularily about latest developments. 

Concerning the anti-vaccine movement, I'm out. I really have no idea what positioning the majority of midwifes holds because I was sure as hell to vaccine my kids and never had the urge to ask anyone about that (accept my pediatrician: ""When's the next appointment?""). I agree with you though that this is an especially harmful and irresponsible advice not to do it.

However, nuclear energy could only replace natural gas in the production of electricity. It is not possible to heat millions of homes with the ""waste heat"" of few dozen power plants.

&gt; Un parti créé en 2007 qui arrive entre 10 et 15% au bout de 7 ans, je trouve ça quand même pas mal. Je comprends pas en quoi c'est moins intéressant qu'un parti qui passe de 10 à 17 en plus de 10 ans. Le FN est le deuxième parti de droite. Le FdG est désormais le deuxième parti de gauche. Pourtant on parle plus d'EELV. Pourquoi ? 

Source, pour le fait qu'on parle plus d'EELV ? 

Sinon, EELV a plus de députés, moins de sénateurs (moins d'emprise territoriale) et plus de députés européens. Ah, et ils participent au gouvernement en place. Me semble qu'ils sont pas négligeables non plus. Et en 2010, leur score aux régionales était deux fois plus important. Ils se sont explicitement rangés du côté du PS, donc tout le monde sait pour qui ils roulent, même s'il y a parfois des soucis entre eux. Cela doit nettement améliorer leur visibilité.

Sinon, en quoi c'est moins intéressant, la ""progression"" du FdG ? 

Déjà, le Front de Gauche n'est pas un parti. Mais un [rassemblement de partis](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_de_gauche_%28France%29), qui n'arrive pas à se maintenir soudé lorsqu'il est question de postes (voir les actuelles élections, avec les soucis liés au PCF...). Mélenchon a beau être leader de ce regroupement, il n'est ""que"" le cofondateur et président du Parti de Gauche.

Le principal moteur et fournisseur d'infrastructures (en termes de militants, fonds, etc) du Front de Gauche est le Parti Communiste Français. Celui-ci cherche à sauver les meubles à l'heure actuelle plus qu'il ne progresse, se rattachant comme il peut au Parti Socialiste ou passant dans le cadre du Front de Gauche. Il n'est pas en progression, il ""résiste"". Et cela fait des décennies qu'il est dans cette position. Autrefois, le PCF était puissant et imposant. Il n'a fait que décliner depuis quelques décennies, et le Front de Gauche lui permet de se reprendre.

Il dispose encore de fabuleux capitaux (sans mauvais jeu de mots), d'infrastructures, de militants, et de compétences internes. Mais c'est un héritage du passé. Ça ne m'étonne pas trop qu'on en parle moins par rapport à la progression du Front National.

Il ne faut pas oublier non plus les stratégies de communication des partis en place. Le FN avance en criant victoire. Le PS sombre dans l'impopularité. L'UMP est complètement embrouillé par les affaires et le délire complet de certains dirigeants. 

Et le Front de Gauche ? Ah. Ben Mélenchon passe dans les médias, et il parle de qui ? De tous les autres. Parti Socialiste, Front National. Le reste du temps, il peste et ronchonne. Où on la voit, la progression ? Mélenchon est en train de fêter les mairies dans lesquelles il va pouvoir *changer les choses* ou révolutionner les territoires ? Nope. Il ronchonne contre le Parti Socialiste, le PCF (vive les dissensions internes exposées au grand jour ! Youpi pour la crédibilité !), le Front National. Et lorsqu'il veut prouver que le Front de Gauche fait aussi des scores, on le retrouve à se comparer. Triste. 

Ah, et on se souvient de lui pour s'être présenté *contre* MLP, plutôt que *pour* un projet très clair dans la tête des électeurs. C'est d'ailleurs cette attitude de perdant qui est tragique. Là où le FN utilisait leur traitement par les médias comme un tremplin et une façon de déranger, on entend constamment Mélenchon geindre et se plaindre. [Voilà le genre d'attitude](http://www.rtl.fr/actualites/info/politique/article/melenchon-epuise-par-la-vie-politique-du-pays-n-est-pas-sur-d-etre-candidat-aux-europeennes-7770629069) de perdant qui ne donne pas envie de voter pour lui, qui ne donne pas d'espoir. Même [réflexion](http://www.bfmtv.com/politique/municipales-melenchon-quitte-precipitamment-plateau-tf1-739013.html)... il veut montrer quoi ? Qu'il a les couilles de quitter le plateau cinq minutes avant la fin ? Qu'il est un révolutionnaire dans l'âme ? Ce mec est sénateur depuis ses 35 ans, a été Ministre, et il se comporte face aux médias comme un amateur.

Pendant ce temps, le Front National parle de lui, considère tous les autres partis avec mépris (ça leur permet de se différencier du FdG/PCF qui est ambigu dans leurs alliances, postes, pactes, etc), met en avant sa victoire et dit que les choses vont changer. Ils maîtrisent à fond leur image, cherche à nettoyer l'objectif des caméras des bourrins qui ternissaient la vision qu'avait le grand public de leur parti, change en profondeur plein d'aspects de leur programme, joue à contre-courant des autres partis, etc. Putain, mais c'est pas un programme, mais un manuel de stratégie politique qu'ils devraient diffuser. :D

Le truc dont les commentateurs ne parlent pas et qui jouent dans leur fascination, c'est plutôt le score du FN *malgré* tous ses handicaps. Ils sont endettés, n'ont aucune base territoriale, un passé de merde, quasiment toutes les élites du pays ne les apprécie pas, et personne ne peut les rejoindre sans se faire exploser la gueule dans les médias ou sans que ça fasse un ""séisme"".

*A contrario*, le Front de Gauche et le PCF ont plus de militants, ont peu de soucis d'image de marque (tu peux rejoindre le FdG sans perdre ton emploi, voir tes amis te tourner le dos, perdre des contrats, etc... et puis personne t'en voudra de les rejoindre quand t'étais jeune ! Au contraire du FN, où ça reste chaud... :D), ont déjà une base de sénateurs, d'élus, de fiefs, une expérience du pouvoir, etc.

C'est bien l'Huma, qui se fait sauver la peau par le gouvernement actuel, hein. Pas Minute ou Rivarol. :D La différence de traitement, comme la différence d'atouts en manche, elle existe.

true,RomeVacationTips,null,null,"Hi there. On request, these are my thoughts.

To answer this question properly I guess there are a few questions that need answering:

1. How much sleep do you need? Are you happy to wander the city all night? Can you get by on five hours?

2. What airport are you coming into?

3. What are your interests - do you want to eat or drink or sightsee?

That said, I can answer one of your questions immediately: no, regrettably there is absolutely nothing interesting to do around the airport at that time. If you fly into Fiumicino during the day there is the ancient town of Ostia Antica a few miles away, which is amazing, and a few beachside towns, but not at night. There's very little at Ciampin apart from a long walk to the ancient road of Via Appia Antica.

Rome is unfortunately not a ""city that never sleeps"". Most bars and restaurants are shut by about 1am, though in certain areas of the city there is a bit more nightlife.

The good aspect of this is that if you're in the city late at night, you get to see and enjoy the famous sights all to yourself. 

Making certain assumptions (you're flying into Fiumicino and can get by on 5 hours's sleep) I'd say it is worth a flying visit to the city. I'd recommend the following walk, which will only take 1-2 hours:

Book a hotel near the very central Termini train station. When you arrive, buy a ticket on the Leonardo Express, which is the fast train to the city and is my preferred method of [travel from Rome airport to the city](http://romevacationtips.com/how-do-i-get-from-the-airports-to-the-city-of-rome/). This should get you to Termini before 10pm. Check in to your hotel and then ask for a restaurant recommendation. Go and eat some amazing Roman pasta - carbonara, cacio e pepe and amatriciana are the traditional Roman tastes.

Then take a stroll down to the Colosseum, turn right and walk along the [Via dei Fori Imperiali](http://romevacationtips.com/no-more-traffic-past-the-colosseum/) through the Forum, then at Piazza Venezia head up Via del Corso to the Fontana di Trevi. At this time the fountain will be mostly empty of tourists and an amazing sight. Grab a gelato on the way.

Head over Piazza Colonna to the Pantheon. This is a good place to grab a late-night gelato at Fior di Luna (if it's still open), then continue on to Piazza Navona.

If you're a party animal, head south over Corso di Vittoria Emanuele to Campo dei Fiori where there are bars and clubs open late into the night. But if you prefer a more sedate nightcap, cross the river to Trastevere where there are many little bars and restaurants. 

Finally, follow the tramlines back across the river and maybe grab a cab back to your hotel to set an early alarm so you can be at the train station at around 6.30. The Leonardo Express leaves every 20 minutes from platform 23 or 24 at Termini and takes 40 minutes. 

You won't have seen *everything* in Rome, notably not the Vatican area, but with only a few hours to experience it, this whistle-stop walking tour will at least get you past many of the amazing sights and allow you to drink in the atmosphere and baroque beauty of this amazing city.

(Note that if you need 8 hours sleep, or are coming into Ciampino airport, this advice might be a bit different!)

Hope this helps!

Perchè? 

Perchè macchia è vittima di soprusi, è una cavia da laboratorio per i trucchi di noi schifosissimi umani, guardate il colore rosso in testa quello è il test per una formula chimica dedicata ai rossetti delle donne.

La striscia nera che vedete, vicinissima agli occhi tralaltro, è un test per un ombretto all'ammoniaca, che la gente sicuramente usa senza sapere nulla della composizione! 

Per non parlare degli altri colori, decine e decine di test su Macchia, ma non solo! 

Infine, vedete le labbra violacee del gatto? 
Sono il sintomo di una reazione allergica ad uno dei componenti dei test.

Macchia adesso è morto, ed insieme a lui decine di migliaia di gatti sono stati usati per questi scopi.

Se anche tu vuoi che questo scempio abbia fine, metti mi piace e condividi il più possibile.

Consider that if you rate sugar, fat, and salt, something like Coca Cola would get only one red for its sugar content, as would apple juice. At the same time, something like pizza would probably not get a single green light, even though pizza isn't actually such a bad idea if you don't go overboard with the cheese, and certainly more nutritious than Coca Cola.

Personally I think it's still a step in the right direction. More transparency and more education are clearly needed. But I can see how Italians would be less happy with a system with weaknesses that disproportionately affect products they export.

We have half of our energy from hydro, but we also have nuclear. And France have even more, thus they are a lot less depending on gas. Please explain to me why you need gas? 

&gt;How is security impacted by energy

Because a country that is energy independent, is far less likely to be blackmailed. For example, Sweden don't depend on energy, we can thus make our choices *not* based on whether Russia will give us gas or not. Germany can't. France is also independent from Russia to a far greater degree. That gives them leverage. Leverage that Germany doesn't have since they have decided to be dependent on Russian gas. 

&gt;Competition wise we don't get our competitiveness from cheap energy. We get it from know how. The energy price has a relatively small influence on why production in Germany makes sense.

It will be a competitive issue when the energy prices rise steeply, when 30 % of your energy disappears, trust me. It will also be a energy/economics/security issue when people get afraid and stop consuming, another recession is not what the Eurozone need right now.

Still, it (and Bohemia as such) was an important industrial centre. In modern history the Prague Spring is a rather notable occurrence. Apart from that, a lot of famous people were born, lived or studied in Prague. I had the pleasure to visit Prague once and the city is amazing.

Yes, he will. 

I have spent a lot of time with Bangladeshis (having grown up in a town in England with a large Bangladeshi community) and also a lot of time with Italians (including Sardinians). I don't think of Italians as being fundamentally different from Bangladeshis. We are all humans and the common human experience is very strong. I would engage with you in the same way that I would engage with a Bangladeshi. I think of you both as foreigners. 

In my mind the main difference is that I might be able to have a conversation with the Bangladeshi about cricket but not the Italian. But I suppose I can talk about rugby with the Italian but not the Bangladeshi. So you're basically equal in my eyes.

In what way would you engage with me differently from how you would engage with a Bangladeshi? ",0,1395745781,null,0,false,0,cgbdcgf,t3_20mnnf,t1_cgbdcgf,t1_cgbd73v,null,1433059043,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I think it's mostly existing infrastructure that would have to be replaced and it's unfeasible right now to do that.

&gt;Because a country that is energy independent, is far less likely to be blackmailed.

Psssh. Come on. Countries get ""blackmailed"" over whether companies with &gt;500 people leave or stay. We subsidised our black coal industry to ludicrous levels because of exactly that ""security"" reason but face it: it's completely meaningless, countries will (effectively) be blackmailed by far far less than ""we're going to cut your heating"". It's already happened it will continue to happen and even the suggestion that countries can even try to resist that level of corruption or blackmail whatever you want to call is ridiculous.

If you put it like that Germany would have ""leverage"" over large parts of the world, they'd just have to seize all naval vessels that are controlled by German companies, that account for 1/3 of the global merchant fleet. Effectively wrecking the global economy over night.

That's exactly the kind of balance of power that makes nations play along. It's the reason there won't be another world war and it's the reason why diplomatic approaches to nearly everything are favorable over others nearly all the time.

&gt;It will be a competitive issue when the energy prices rise steeply, when 30 % of your energy disappears, trust me.

Yeah no... I'll believe that when I see it. Mostly because I think that our economy can compensate by passing those increased costs to the customers of *products you can't buy anywhere else*. Do you honestly think that foreign companies will not finish, say a 5 year ship building contract, a contract over new Siemens turbines for their power plant or that people won't buy their new quality car because the price goes up somewhere &lt;5%?

&gt; It will also be a energy/economics/security issue when people get afraid and stop consuming, another recession is not what the Eurozone need right now. 

Why would people stop consuming? Do you have any idea how dirt cheap energy is right now? I can run my stuff at home, computers, light, machines and probably heating for less than the value of 10 to 15 meals, comparatively.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; It really happened. See BBC annotations of Putin's speech. 

What really, actually happened in reality was:

One:  
In 2012 Yanokovich pushes through the Ukrainian Law on Language Policy. The new law is adopted illegally and uncostitutionally, and is heavily criticised by human rights watchdogs, academics and scholars, representatives of other minorities and ministeries as lopsided, substandard, and disproportionally favouring one language. 

The law was [criticized](http://www.uaba.org/resources/Documents/Blog%20Docs/12-08-23%20Amb%20Vollebaek%20Letter%20to%20Ukrainian-Am%20%20Bar%20Assoc_16%20Aug.pdf) by the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities as its *""approach to language policy is deeply divisive and is likely to lead to future polarization of society. Indeed, the disproportionate favoring of the Russian language, while also removing most incentives for learning or using Ukrainian in large parts of the country, could potentially undermine Ukraine’s very cohesion""*. He was also concerned that the legislation was not adopted in accordance with Ukrainian constitutional and procedural law.

The Council of Europe stated ([1](http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=CDL-REF%282011%29001-e), [2](http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=CDL%282011%29101-e)) that the legislation failed to provide a proper balance between the development and use of a state language as a unifying factor in society and the development and protection of minority languages in accordance with European standards.

The law was also criticized by Ukrainian legal scholars, the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and other academic institutions, and numerous ministeries within the Yanukovych government as divisive and failing to protect the rights of all Ukrainians irrespective of their ethnic background.

But the law has **no effect in Crimea** as an autonomus region. Nothing changes there because of that law.

Two:  
In 2014 about 300 illegally and uncostitutionally adopted laws and acts by Yanukovich are to be repealed, and the Ukrainian Law on Language Policy is one law among them. But the PM prevents repealing it saying that it's better to first prepare better language legislation. The law is not repealed and remains in effect.

And again, whether the law was repealed or not would have had **no effect in Crimea** as an autonomus region. Nothing would have changed there if the law was repealed - but it wasn't.

Three:  
But Russian state media had already started spreading propaganda lies about it and a myth is born: that the new Ukrainian government has created a new language law (didn't happen) with purpose of oppressing the Russian minority (didn't happen) including Crimea (not even applicable). And variations of that get repeated in the media.",0,1395747533,null,0,1395747821,0,cgbdnrc,t3_217yty,t1_cgbdnrc,t1_cgbc5ls,null,1433059192,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Yugoslav wars, from a common Westerner's perspective, was a clear case of good vs. bad, while the reality, the one that I unfortunately experienced first hand, was very different, with all sorts of shit going on. I can talk to you for hours about the horrors I had to endure as a kid during wartime, but that would be anecdotal and not nearly enough to get the whole picture, but trust me, I've seen everything - from mortar shells ripping a boy apart and his father barging in our house with a handgun and asking my mother to knock on our Muslim neighbor's doors since it was more likely for them to open if she would be the one to call them (he wanted to kill them just because the shell came from Muslim Army positions; it took nerves of steel for my mother, who just recently lost her father to a gang a Muslims who killed him just because of his nationality, to calm him down and prevent another unnecessary bloodshed - two wrongs don't make it right), to hearing an explosion going off in the middle of the night and later understanding it was a guy who came home from the frontline and killed his whole family with a handgrenade), to having to go to school with a sight of a second story apartment still in flames, with its walls knocked out by a rocket artillery explosion, to cowering at the strongest point of our apartment on the eve of 31st December of 1996 with fireworks going off reminiscent of recent bombings, and our neighbor and my mother smoking on their balconies and semi-jokingly remarking how they should run for the shelter, to seeing my father for the first time in a couple of years and running from the sight of the unknown man in a uniform... and still, our multi-national neighborhood endured, with nearly zero incidents, Croats, Muslims and Serbs, all trying to survive the nightmare they found themselves in...

You said that we forgive German people?

Do you know why we forgive them? 

Because they genuinely accepted collective guilt. While Serbian collectively argue about injustice. 

You don't see German in every frigid forum arguing about crimes that they experienced during Russian counter offensive, or as said posting images of Dresden saying ""for some reason Dresden was flattened"". If Serbs start accepting the responsibility, maybe eventually there would be argument in history classes, how necessary was NATO intervention, etc.... But even there it is hard for Serbians to win the moral argument. (if  discussion comes forward  in philosophy classes)  Milosevic forces were in full offensive against Albanian population, while when Dresden was bombed Allies had already had an upper hand. What Serb can argue is the aftermath. (displacement of Serbs after NATO troops came to Kosovo) etc...

Edit: 
i would add that i don't agree with OP sentiment taht you could remove  Milosevic but you didin't

and while we are under your pretex ""we forgive Germans."" Japan was Atomic Bombed, something that was totally unnecessary (even though historian argue it was to end the war and bring Hirohito to his knees)  and even after that they become major US ally in Asia. Do you see any Japanese posting images and saying ""for some reason they bombed us""?? It is not  ""was this necessary?""...but ""for some reason"". ""for some reason"" - implies total ignorance and abundance of responsibility. 

For some reason Vukovar was bombed?

I am not saying that Serbs deserved it but it will play no good to   Serbians if they act as if they are the SOLE victims of the end chapter (NATO bombings) in ex-YU. Europe saw war in ex-yu trough different eyes and thanks to Milosevic, Serbs were seen as ""remove kebab"" people.

Le plébiscite dont parle Renan est un processus mental: celui par lequel chaque citoyen appartient de son gré à la nation, accepte et demande de faire communauté. Rien à voir avec la pratique du referendum (qui est soit dit en passant la pire manière de gouverner un Etat à long terme).

Sur la nation quasi-naturelle, tu as tout un corpus d'ouvrages de discours de première ou de seconde main qui te renseigneront. Discuter avec des militants ou se rendre en réunion publiques est pas mal non plus pour réaliser cela. De tête, le seul ouvrage dont je me souviens, qui était très bon mais un peu ancien, *Le Pen, les mots* de Nonna Mayer. Dès que j'ai accès à mon PC je peux t'en fournir d'autres.

La nationalité, mais justement c'est là que se trouve le gros point d'achoppement: il ne s'agit pas d'un fait donné, mais d'un principe émancipateur - dont la France a d'ailleurs été le formidable promoteur dans l'histoire. Ce n'est pas une simple catégorie acquise à la naissance pour classer des gens dans un groupe mais quelque chose qui doit être sans cesse réaffirmé.

D'ailleurs, au niveau de la rhétorique, on voit bien la définition ""négative"" que peut donner le FN: parler plus du ""eux"" que du ""nous"", insister sur la différence (y compris le droit à la différence) alors même que l'identité, par définition, suit une logique de l'*idem*, du droit au même. De là vient d'ailleurs la différence entre nationalisme - la haine de ceux qui n'appartiennent pas à notre groupe -, et patriotisme - l'amour de sa patrie et la volonté que le plus de monde possible, qu'ils y appartiennent ou non, partagent cet amour.

Even more: one can find a post in self-righteous tone with a flag:fr next to it (we all heard absurd excuse of ""peaceful"" guns and vessels Paris sells to whoever has money) keeping in mind that in this situation population of Russia is a lot less capable to protest. So all those numerous witty threads that jump on any person with a flag:ru is a bigoted and I will downvote them together with all responses to them (defensive or sarcastic or accusatory) and invite fellow redditors to do the same.

On the other hand we all know soviet type of distraction technique journalism, when major bad news is shown as no big deal ancient history and quickly there are some good news, everything is balanced out and the show goes on as usual. Also, playing down gravity of things with jokes, injection of doubt and uncertainty and derailing any thoughtful discussion with absurd comparisons are also known techniques to be aware of and not to tolerate.

The fact that I had to search the entire thread to find a single clear opponent of nuclear power makes me sad and pessimistic about our society.

I cannot understand that anyone knowing about the details of Chernobyl, Fukushima, Three Mile Island etc. disasters can still support nuclear power.
Billions of D-Marks and Euros of subsidies have been pumped into nuclear power by the German (and most other) governments, only to get dependent on power plants that produce and require the most toxic substances in the world (quarried under slave-like conditions and without protection, e.g. in Niger by our nuclear fanboys, the French), cost a shitload of money to build, maintain (and disassemble!!) and making a few managers of RWE, EnBW etc. stinking rich, although these plants are basically financed by the public!

Nuclear power isn't cheap, in the 60s, everyone promised ""energy for free"", but the opposite happenend and electricity costs rose every year. Taking all costs into account, it is the most expensive way to create electricity.

Shutting down most of its nuclear power plants after Fukushima was one of the only right decisions of our last government and showed that we're not the tiniest bit dependant on it. In 2013, only 8,8% of our electricity was produced by nuclear power plants, and I'd rather have a few coal power stations reactivated than those ticking time bombs until we built some more wind turbines etc..

As some others here have pointed out, ""Russian gas"" is mainly used for heating here and thus cannot by replaced by turning nuclear power plans back on, so most of the comments here (proposing just that) don't make any sense.

Had to get this off my chest, I'm okay now!

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  The reason is that alternative energy sources simply don't have the capacity to replace nuclear power today and in some fields, such as solar energy, years' worth of research is required before it would become practical to deploy then on a large scale in a place like Germany.

PV has been researched for decades. That companies have to get motivated to research technologies somehow aside, the rather stunning reduction of production cost over the past years came from improved efficiency in manufacturing processes, economies of scale and development of supply chains. For this to happen and to continue, there has to be a market. Germany's share of global PV capacity has come down to about a quarter, but it used to be one half just three or four years ago.  
You can see what a difference a more mature market makes even in installation cost, which by now is a major share of the total cost of PV, when you [compare](http://blog.rmi.org/blog_2013_12_05_can_usa_solar_cost_compete_with_germany) those costs between Germany and the US.

&gt;On 20 July 2010, Voina staged one of their more notorious actions in the Nakhodka supermarket in St. Petersburg. A female Voina activist nicknamed ""Vacuous Cunt With Inconceivably Huge Tits""  removed a [chicken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(food\)) from the refrigerated section of the supermarket, then laboriously stuffed the entire chicken into her own vagina, while being filmed by other Voina members. She then [shoplifted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoplifting) the chicken by leaving the supermarket without paying, with the chicken still inserted, and rejoined protesters outside the store.  The activists held signs spelling out the word *""bezblyadno""*, which translates roughly as ""without whoring"", a reference to the group's rejection of paid employment and preference for stealing food, and a pun on the word *besplatno*, ""free (of charge)"".

But we have no hydro power ourselves, none at all. Hydro power needs two things to work. 1: Water, preferably a huge river (Denmark got some rivers). But you also need 2: Height difference. And what with the highest point in Denmark being 'bout 180 meters we lack that. With no real height difference you can't make the water from the river flow quickly enough (under enough pressure) to efficiently produce enough power for it to be economical. There is also a local environmental problem with (some?) hydro power, since building a huge dam can damage local wild life.

Danish energy sources: http://www.ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/klima-co2/Statistik/foreloebig_energistatistik_2013.xlsx

Looking at table 1 you have our production. Even combining all renewable energy and waste burning it's only about as much our source for energy as natural gas. And our production of crude oil is about twice as much as our gas. So 1/4 renewable/waste, 1/4 gas, 2/4 oil.

Looking at table 2, we got our consumption (main difference is that we export some oil and a bit of gas and import coal and a bit of renewable energy instead): Still pretty much the same picture about 3/4 of our consumption is fossil fuels.

What is most interesting about it, IMO, is that we seem to steadily decrease our total energy consumption, with about 6%. It's not great, but we're reducing need for energy while also swapping fossils fuels with renewables.

true,quantum-confinement,MOLD,Moldova,"&gt;That companies have to get motivated to research technologies somehow aside, the rather stunning reduction of production cost over the past years came from improved efficiency in manufacturing processes, economies of scale and development of supply chains.

This is true, but it's not the full story. As recently as a decade ago, it appeared that the material costs of the crystalline silicon modules would be the dominant factor limiting the cost of these systems. It is largely for this reason that such large investments were made in alternative technologies like organic photovoltaics or thin film solar cells. However, it was only a few years ago when the production level of silicon in China skyrocketed (almost certainly because of large subsidies), that the price of the silicon modules dropped by an order of magnitude, such that today these costs only represent lass than half of the total cost, which is why soft costs like the ones you mentioned are becoming so important.

&gt;So, we can invest today and keep on accelerating the price drop, or we can wait until, somehow (magically?), prices come down on their own and then wait another couple of years until the supply chains and experience materialize themselves out of nothing.

I think you misunderstood what I said. I fully support government support for photovoltaic technologies and more broadly for all renewable energy sources (in fact, working in a related field I even have a selfish interest in this assistance being as extensive as possible). My point, however, is that while we should go full speed ahead in developing these new technologies, that does not mean that in the interim we should roll back nuclear energy if this can result in a greater dependence on coal and fossil fuels.

You completely trivialized what I wrote, misunderstood what I was saying, and obviously replaced any arguments I had with a ""playing the victim"" card. You do not realize the vast scope of the anti-Milosevic protests, you are not aware of the huge draft evasion that was active during the 90s, you have no idea about the dangers of being in the opposition until after 1999. when Milosevic's forces were weakened and his ability to steal votes from Kosovo Albanians was hindered. You seem to think that the first attempt to get rid of Milosevic was the one in 2000. It was not.

50 years of communism with Tito as a head-of-state with a cult of personality... a well organized secret service and secret police force... corrupt courts and state officials... and you expect people born in this era to simply oust Milosevic? Milosevic was just one man, a whole system stood behind him. After that system collapsed due to the lack of funds and major internal conflicts, only then could Milosevic himself be toppled.

Your attempts to make me seem like a kid crying for his toys and a few bridges are intellectually dishonest and probably stem from a personal level of hatred you are not willing to let go. Like I said - you completely ignored what I said and replaced my grief with yours.

My parents haven't supported the regime. They voted against Milosevic every single time. The votes you saw overwhelmingly in favor of Milosevic were real, but also partly stolen, partly blackmailed. You voted for SPS in order to keep your job, or because state TV told you your pension would be extinguished if you vote for anybody else. If you're a Kosovo Albanian, there was a high chance of your vote going directly to Milosevic, even though you haven't even voted.

In the internet era this is kinda silly to discuss, but during those days we couldn't watch anything other than RTS TV (the official state channel), and you could get in trouble for owning a satellite dish. The huge anti-milosevic protests were recorded in such a way to present them as a ""tiny group of hooligans"", while any pro-milosevic protest was gloriously presented for a full 15 minutes when the news lasted only for 30 minutes. That, and due to the fact that cameras were very expensive back then, there aren't many recordings to be found online of anti-milosevic protests. If you had a camera, it was huge and probably VHS based, and the police would gladly smash it for you, along with your ribs:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHanBqjvQnI

Even so, protests were a regular sight. If you were a bit more vocal, your family would get threatened, and you could very well end up like [Slavko Ćuruvija](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavko_%C4%86uruvija).

**1998** - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDvP-8Le3UE

**1999** - well, you know... staging an anti-milosevic protest at this time could very well get you shot.

**2000** (finally) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l16nrXS1rxs

I clearly remember regular protests in my hometown... especially around 19:30, when the state news starts broadcasting. Pots and pans were the weapon of choice, along with anything that could draw attention. I saw people turning their lights on and off constantly in nearby buildings, really awesome sight of defiance.

My cousin ran off from the military police routinely to avoid being drafted, even though he had two kids at the time. My dad was demoted at his place of work because he wasn't a Milosevic sympathizer, my other cousin wasn't so lucky and he got drafted and got his chest shot off.

This is from Wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia_in_the_Yugoslav_Wars

&gt;The high number of casualties incurred in the Battle of Vukovar caused serious popular discontent in Serbia and Montenegro, where tens of thousands of those receiving draft papers went into hiding or left the country. A near-mutiny broke out in some reservist units, and mass demonstrations against the war were held in the Serbian towns of Valjevo, Čačak and Kragujevac. **In one famous incident, a tank driver named Vladimir Živković drove his tank all the way from the front line at Vukovar to the federal parliament in Belgrade.** Many Serbs simply did not identify with the Croatian Serb cause and were unwilling to see their lives, or those of their children, sacrificed at Vukovar.

The Serbian government wants us to see Albanians as natural enemies in the same way the Kosovo government wants to see Serbs as natural enemies. This fuels their election campaigns very nicely.

To add: I remember Milosevic's speeches on TV. The things he said vs the things he had done are completely separate. Not once did he call for offensive wars publicly. He spoke only of peace and defense of ""our centuries old homeland"". Every single speech of his had the word ""peace"" in it. To this day I don't know if he was outright lying, or has he deluded himself into believing his own patriotic speeches.

And on Press TV, to quote the Article 

&gt; In 2009, the channel showed an interview with Maziar Bahari, a ""Newsweek"" journalist, who had been jailed in Tehran while covering mass protests against a disputed presidential election.
Mr Bahari said this interview had been conducted under duress and his captors had threatened him with execution unless he gave the answers wanted. Last year, Ofcom imposed a fine of £100,000 on Press TV, reversing an earlier decision to revoke the channel's licence.
As part of the investigation into this incident, Ofcom found that editorial decisions governing the channel were taken in Tehran. It wanted Press TV to be under the editorial control of the same company in London that held the broadcasting licence. Alternatively, the licence could have been transferred to Tehran.


Interviewing people under violent duress seems pretty worthy of a punishment to me. As does the jiggery pokery about where the licence and the editorial control was from. 

Basically youre grasping at straws to try and find even a bare equivalency.

&gt;Ce n'est pas une simple catégorie acquise à la naissance pour classer des gens dans un groupe mais quelque chose qui doit être sans cesse réaffirmé.

Et c'est même un honneur qui doit être sans cesse célébré. Le FN promeut l'unité nationale. Il suffit de lire [le programme](http://www.frontnational.com/pdf/Programme.pdf).

&gt;au niveau de la rhétorique, on voit bien la définition ""négative que peut donner le FN: parler plus du ""eux"" que du ""nous""

Source ? Si je regarde le programme, il parle beaucoup plus du nous. Si j'écoute les discours, ils parlent avant tout des Français.

&gt;insister sur la différence

&gt;nationalisme - la haine de ceux qui n'appartiennent pas à notre groupe

Ah non, [c'est tout l'inverse](http://gollnisch.com/2014/02/20/referendum-suisse-bruno-gollnisch-face-catherine-trautmann/) : le FN respecte évidement les autres pays, simplement des solutions qui seraient adaptées aux pays de cultures différentes ne le sont pas forcément pour la France.

&gt;et la volonté que le plus de monde possible, qu'ils y appartiennent ou non, partagent cet amour.

Nobody is going to argue that these people are not taxed like a permanent Irish resident. 

But here's the thing, Irish people are both taxed and most live here on a permanent basis. That money they earn in their job stays in Ireland, gets spend in Ireland, and stimulates Irish economy much more so than someone who - yes, pays their taxes - then saves that money and sends it on home to Poland, or Finland or Germany or wherever they are from.

Le mec est contre l'UE, mais pour lui, le FN est pire que les partis européïstes, car ... il dit qu'il est contre l'UE. Logique imparable.

Sur la deuxième, Asselineau fait sans arrêt la confusion entre l'UE (organisation politique) et l'Europe (notion géographique), pour discréditer le FN. Le FN ne propose pas de sortir la France de l'Europe, on ne va pas la détacher géographiquement, faut être sacrément malhonnête pour faire croire que c'est la même chose que l'opposition à l'UE.

Ensuite, il ment à nouveau en disant que le FN ne parle pas des intérêts divergents au sein de l'UE. Il suffit pourtant de lire le programme :

*Avec la dérive progressive de la PAC, avec les élargissements successifs de l’Union européenne, et encore
plus depuis 2010 avec le traité de Lisbonne, la France a perdu toute maîtrise de sa politique agricole, puis
de ses échanges de produits agro-alimentaires, au profit d’une Europe à la fois bureaucratique et gagnée
par la doctrine ultra-libérale mondialiste,* **composée de pays aux intérêts parfois divergents, et dès lors
incapable de s’opposer efficacement à l’emprise croissante de la finance et des marchés.**

Après, il s'excite sur la profession de foi d'une page A5, en reprochant qu'elle ne contient pas assez de choses, et en occultant le programme qui lui les contient. Le programme contient explicitement la phrase suivante : *il faudra que* **la France retrouve la maîtrise de sa monnaie et de sa politique monétaire**.

Bref, c'est pas sérieux. Au lieu d'essayer de convaincre ceux qui ne veulent pas sortir ni de l'UE ni de l'euro, il passe son temps à critiquer ceux qui sont d'accord sur ces points, à faire semblant de ne pas voir les preuves qui le montrent, et à mentir sur l'absence de projet de [sortie de l'euro au FN](http://www.frontnational.com/pdf/fin-euro.pdf).",0,1395764637,null,0,false,0,cgbjn9h,t3_21azsk,t1_cgbjn9h,t1_cgbezgh,null,1433062078,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

Again, Sweden is a small country, with lots of opportunity for hydro. You also have a low population density so your power grid can manage electric heating, and you do not a big history of gas.

Effectivement l'ensemble du post ne m'a pas convaincu. Je ne m'attaque pas à sa thèse, je demande des explications, car mon ressenti est différent du sien.

En particulier l'ensemble de son exposé repose sur deux affirmations : *l'extrême-droite promeut une nation quasi-naturelle* et *la source du fait national serait la tradition plus que la raison/volonté*. Ces affirmations ne sont pas fondées, et sont contradictoires avec les liens que j'apporte. 

En particulier, si tu regardes la position des Le Pen sur les territoires d'outre mer, ou si tu écoutes les discours que j'ai mis, le coup du ""ils parlent de français de souche bouh ils sont racistes racialistes"" ne tient pas.

Après, sur la forme, /u/Gatzfield affirme connaître ""l'esprit même de la République et de ce qui fait la France"" dans sa première phrase, et en particulier le connaitre mieux que les militants FN. Je trouve cela extrêmement prétentieux, et cela n'est absolument pas valide comme argumentation.

Et surtout, il multiplie les affirmations gratuites sur ce qu'il pense être la conception du FN, sans aucune preuve ni source.

Ensuite, sur les downvotes, il faut être honnête. Je critique quelqu'un qui dit du mal du FN. C'est mal, donc on me downvote. Peut-être pas toi personnellement, mais c'est comme ça que ça se passe pour la majorité.

Je n'ai pas à prendre position dans ma réponse, j'ai déjà dit ce que je pensais du FN [ici](http://www.reddit.com/user/Bertrand_Du_Declin). Commentaire évidemment lui aussi downvoté, car il ne dit pas directement du mal du FN.

Is there any evidence implicating Putin in any of these? Or is it just your assumption? Just like in the Middle East, Mexico and South America there were tens of journalists killed in Chechnya and Dagestan. There is nothing of substance implicating Putin or his government as personally responsible for any of these though. You said that Putin kills his political opponents, this is false. You say that there is repression of opposition opinions, but you can just go and buy yourself a newspaper and read every Litvinenko conspiracy you like. There will be no KGB agent waiting at your door afterwards.

The end result is that the U.S. has a much smaller public sector overall than Western European countries have, much lower levels of social-welfare spending, and much higher levels of crime. Even supposedly ""left-wing"" parts of the U.S., like California, do not have nearly as good a social system as Denmark: no single-payer healthcare, much worse unemployment benefits, no free universities, much worse maternity/paternity leave, much less than 6 weeks vacation, no subsidized child-care, etc. Generally also much higher levels of income inequality.

I've also lived in both the United States and Denmark. I have never found a large city in the U.S. that was safe.

Denmark [spends](http://www.dst.dk/en/Statistik/emner/offentlige-finanser/sociale-udgifter-ESSPROS.aspx) about $22,000 per citizen on social protection (social-system expenditures of $120 billion, with a population of 5.5 million).

true,rtfactor,null,null,"I know Ukraine for quite some time, and looking back at its reality since the beginning of 2000's I was finding many things very strange, specially the increasing corruption that was more then simple corruption. It was a corruption fearless of laws and justice or any kind of consequences, specially in the last few years, where authorities become more and more corrupt and stopped carrying justice and started protecting the thieves. This corruption wouldn't exist if it was not coming from the top, and even at the top such corruption wouldn't exist if they (leaders) didn't have a plan and a backup for when things start collapsing.

A president that was democratically elected would never steal so much and build such number of luxurious houses in his own country, knowing that tomorrow democracy can bring to power an opponent that could scrutinize his and his family wealth, not only houses and billions in bank accounts but also privatization of huge pieces of land, including natural parks. Remember, even between thieves there's an higher competition, and unless he was moving towards a dictatorship or a division/sell of the country, he wouldn't be doing that, and either way he would need external support. 

The changes in constitution and a presidential system that was bringing to government whoever the president chooses, the cuts in the military budgets and increased investments in internal security specially the Berkut that were getting a salary 3 times higher than police, was not to protect citizens. 

People in the beginning had to merge with corruption in order to obtain anything. Bribes became a common practice that people started accepting since it was the only way to get even a passport. But the more corruption was dominating the country, more difficult life was becoming with corruption turning everything into a competition of power and money, where the poor were getting more poor and unable to do anything, and no matter how strong one was and how much money he had, there was always somebody stronger and with more money that will defeat him. Even the ones that were corrupt started realizing that corruption was not the way to continue, as nothing was guaranteed, nothing was safe... So, a revolt started boiling. 

Yes, I'm proud of Ukraine too... they have shown that they have a will, and this will is not a path that is paved by corruption. They knew where it was coming from, and what was behind it, but they couldn't prove it, but still, they could make a change and they did. 

Now it can be clearly seen who was behind this game of corruption, supporting and protecting the corrupt thieves... who are the ones refusing to let go... who are the ones refusing to accept the Ukrainian people will, and doing everything to block it, to undermine it, to disrupt it, no matter the consequences... no matter human respect.

She only heard stories that he might be somewhere in prison camp in the middle of Soviet-Russia. Suddenly she looks out and sees druck lights coming closer and closer. Can it be him, she questioned herself. But no, the druck stopped and 2 armed huge men walked closer to the house while 3rd one stayed out next to druck. Time stopped and suddenly realization hit her when those 2 men where knocking on the door. She opened the door, her hands where shaking. It was cold out there and first thing she saw the massive guns pointing at her. 15 minutes you have time to pack your things and come with us. We know who you are, wake up children now. She was in panic, who are those men? One of the men raised his weapon and repeated once again. 15 minutes! She ran out of the kitchen to room and woke everyone up. Children where sleepy and didn't knew what was happening. Older children helped younger to get dressed, while her mother packed only basic things she could find. 15 minutes where passed, they where pushed into the druck. First thing she saw was her neighbour who was in tears. Her neighbour started to cry louder and louder. One of the man came closer and yelled. Shut up or I shoot you all. Nobody knew what was happening. Druck was driving and driving around 40 minutes while it stopped. For moment she thought this is it. She hugged her children, thinking this is last time. But no, there was other people. Men came closer and yelled. Get out and be quiet. She understood where they where. Rail station, she has been there. She looked the men who pointed guns direction of animal wagons. People where pushed in, there was loud crying everywhere. There was nothing in there, just 1 pucket. Wagon doors where closed and destination unknown started. This is the story like many others had in this night.

C'est justement le comble puisqu'on a mis dans la tête de Français que le FN est contre l'euro

&gt; seul la secte de l'UPR est contre l'UE).

Calomnie si t'as pas d'argument...Rappel de la [définition d'une secte](http://www.derives-sectes.gouv.fr/quest-ce-quune-d%C3%A9rive-sectaire) :

&gt; Elle se caractérise par la mise en œuvre, par un groupe organisé ou par un individu isolé, quelle que soit sa nature ou son activité, de pressions ou de techniques ayant pour but de créer, de maintenir ou d’exploiter chez une personne un état de sujétion psychologique ou physique, la privant d’une partie de son libre arbitre

Asselineau explique comment fonctionnent l'UE et les traités, ne cesse de réclamer des débats contradictoires aux personnes politiques (qui refusent par trouillardise) et invite les Français à comparer, critiquer et juger ce que tous les partis politiques leur disent. Un gourou est irréprochable, quand le FN change tout le temps d'avis sur l'euro il l'est aussi. La secte, c'est bien le FN.

&gt; Le mec est contre l'UE, mais pour lui, le FN est pire que les partis européïstes, car ... il dit qu'il est contre l'UE. Logique imparable.

Il a raison puisque comme tu le dis le FN n'est pas contre l'UE. 

&gt; Ensuite, il ment à nouveau en disant que le FN ne parle pas des intérêts divergents au sein de l'UE. Il suffit pourtant de lire le programme

Le  fait de mettre des pays aux intérêts divergents permet à un fédérateur extérieur à l'Europe d'imposer sa politique à lui, comme De Gaulle l'avait prédit alors qu'il n'y avait que 6 Etats à l'époque. Les Américains sont à la manoeuvre derrière, c'est une manoeuvre géopolitique de vassalisation du continent et ça, le FN ne le dit pas.

&gt; Après, il s'excite sur la profession de foi d'une page A5, en reprochant qu'elle ne contient pas assez de choses,

Argument épouvantail : il ne repoche pas qu'il y ait trop de choses, il reproche qu'il n'y a pas un mot sur l'euro ou l'UE dans cette feuille A5 envoyé à des millions de Français et aux archives nationales. L'essentiel n'est pas là, crédibilité zéro, manipulation totale.

&gt; Le programme contient explicitement la phrase suivante : il faudra que la France retrouve la maîtrise de sa monnaie et de sa politique monétaire[...] il passe son temps à critiquer ceux qui sont d'accord sur ces points

Tout le problème est là, il ne dit pas *comment* le faire, c'est-à-dire en utilisant l'article 50 du TUE, que refuse de mettre en oeuvre le FN. Aucune mention de l'article 50 dans la profession de foi : crédibilité zéro.

&gt; à mentir sur l'absence de projet de sortie de l'euro au FN.

Le discours du FN dans les médias sur l'euro varie d'un jour à l'autre et la sortie de l'euro n'est pas visible sur la propagande envoyée aux Français. Pourquoi ? Ca leur ferait trop mal de la mettre ? Les paroles s'envolent, les écrits restent.

Aussi, le texte sur le .pdf relève d'une incompétence notoire voire d'une malhonneteté puisque le FN propose d'utiliser l'article 50 pour négocier alors qu'il ne l'est que pour sortir de l'UE.

&gt; D’autres voies légales sont possibles, sans remettre en cause l’UE dans son ensemble

Faux, il est impossible de sortir juridiquement de l'euro sans aussi quitter l'UE.

Confirmé dans [cette interview](http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/futures-elections-jean-marie-le-pen-evoque-une-alliance-ump-fn-09-02-2013-2553931.php) : *Je rappelle quand même que cette alliance a toujours été rejetée alors que si elle ne se justifie pas sur un plan politique par un accord de gouvernement puisque nous sommes en désaccord sur des sujets essentiels comme l'""euromondialisation"", l'immigration etc, elle se justifie dans des élections à deux tours», répond l'ancien patron du parti d'extrême droite.*

Bel exemple de malhonnêteté. Ce genre de post déshonnore l'UPR.

&gt;La députée du FN Marion Maréchal-Le Pen a cosigné une proposition de loi présentée par plusieurs députés de l’UMP en janvier 2013 pour reconnaître officiellement le « génocide vendéen » entre 1793 et 1796 ; quelques semaines après, elle a appelé à des « alliances de circonstance » avec l’UMP (article du Monde.fr, 17 mars 2013)

Donc ta conception, c'est qu'il ne faut cosigner aucune loi avec l'UMP ?

Où est la logique ?

&gt;Le double-jeu du FN sur le «jour de colère» confirmé par Paul-Marie Coûteaux, porte-parole de Mme Le Pen et candidat FN à Paris

Aucun rapport avec une alliance UMP/FN. De plus, PM Couteaux n'est pas membre du FN mais a son propre parti (le SIEL), qui est au RBM.

&gt;le FN est là pour pourrir tout débat serein avec ses dérapages

Donc le problème, ce n'est pas le fanatisme de nos élites sur les questions de l'immigration, ou de l'euro, c'est le FN...

&gt;Une seule solution, et l'anti-thèse même du FN, c'est l'UPR

Il fotovoltaico sfrutta dei materiali che generano elettricità quando si scaldano, quindi si spegne dopo un po' di tempo all'ombra. Il sistema termico consiste nell'usare l'energia elettrica per far diventare acqua vapore e con quello far girare una turbina che poi produce elettricità.

Il fotovoltaico (di solito i pannelli solari privati) è chiaramente fregato dalle nuvole e dalla notte. Le centrali però sono quasi tutte del secondo tipo, e hanno un'emissione di elettricità abbastanza regolare, perché riescono a immagazzinare il calore. I metodi recenti consistono nel prendere qualche tonnellata di specchi ustori e puntarli tutti contro una palla enorme di sale (!) che piazzano su un trespolo al centro. Il sale è molto efficiente a mantenere il calore. Quindi la centrale solare standard ha una palla colossale di magma di sale, che riscalda le tubature d'acqua, e rimane bollente per un casino di tempo. Non so esattamente quanto nuvolo consecutivo possa reggere, però non è certo sole = on/nuvoloso = off.

true,ForFUCKSSAKE_,null,null,"&gt; apart from the U.S. federal government not spending much money on social services

So, it seems basic reading is the trouble here. Over 50% of the US federal budget alone is for entitlements and social programs. Lets also remember that large portion of the defense spending is on military pay where they also get free university, healthcare for life etc.

&gt;no single-payer healthcare, much worse unemployment benefits, no free universities, much worse maternity/paternity leave, much less than 6 weeks vacation, no subsidized child-care, etc. Generally also much higher levels of income inequality.

You sound like someone whose entire world view comes from reddit. There are many ways to attend university for cheap or free, child care is subsidized and there are all kinds of programs for this, income inequality has nothing to do with standard of living, unemployment benefits are adequate, paternity leave is one of those reddit things that no one int he real world gives much of a fuck about but many states have maternity leave laws, vacation varies so much it's pointless to try and compare. You just rambled out a bunch of tired old reddit talking points. Not everything needs to be government mandated and regulated to work.

There is plenty of criticism of Putin, his policies and all these things in Russia. It's not Saudi Arabia where they just chop your head off. You are mistaken if you think so. In Russia you can write a book about cutting Putin's head off and sticking a dick in it, no one will stop you.

Now you say, ok, we as a society criticised our mistakes and still do. But did anything come out of it? You just assume that since you are *allowed* to criticise anything your government does this makes your country somehow *freer* or your opinions and your government policies *more legit*. And yet UK still went to Libya, with majority of population being either supportive or indifferent. Western media is no less indoctrinating than the Russian media after all, there is no other explanation.

To the point of the *policy making*, anything Putin had introduced recently with regard to protests or NGO functions is taken straight out of UK and USA law books. It's the very same policies that had been introduced in UK and USA as part of *Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act* or the *Patriot Act*. People seem to get a kick out of criticising Russia for these, disregarding the fact that their own countries have the very same legislation in place.

Then you have a pile of allegations of *murderous regime*. Is Putin's regime any less murderous than of those countries that compose the NATO alliance? Not really. And yet you hear the loudest criticism from these very countries. UK officials have no right to speak from a high horse denouncing Russian regime as murderous when they have just as much blood on their hands.

Is it more corrupt? Perhaps. But the majority of Russians are fine with it, as long as living standards are rising like they did throughout Putin's time in Kremlin. There are few things that can make them change their minds and hypocrisy is certainly not one of them. All the bullshit you hear about Russia on CNN and BBC only strengthens their resolve. Meanwhile in the West people like you seem to have this silly notion that their own regimes are somehow *superior* to the one in Russia. Even though there are more than enough issues at home as well. No one wins really. Everyone is just deluding themselves happily. In the beginning you asked for examples.

Sigh. We've been over this before:

- Giraffes aren't an endangered species.

- The giraffe wasn't butchered, it was dissected. Public dissections aren't that uncommon. The following Tuesday of the Marius dissection, and unnamed wolf was dissected at the Danish Institute of Zoology. No people shouted out about that. Why's a giraffe any different from a wolf, or what makes it different from any of the other animals we butcher on a daily basis for food?

- The zoo couldn't pass their giraffe on to any zoo outside the breeding programme, it's part of their rules. Neither could they have sold it. It would make incentives to breed ""cash animals"" and then sell it to rich people, which would cause an even further outrage. And to be part of the breeding programme, you need to be able to guarantee a certain standard of life for the animals.

- No zoo inside the breeding programme had the capacity to take another giraffe.

- A normal breeding cycles is considered healthy for animals inside a zoo, as it's part of making their lives as natural as possible.

- The giraffe already had two older brothers, so its genes had already been passed on.

- The giraffe couldn't stay in Copenhagen Zoo, it's father would soon start to beat it up, since there is usually only one mature male in a herd, if there are any females present.

- Why feed it to the lions? Well, why waste several hundred pounds of perfectly good meat? If they hadn't fed the lions with the giraffe meat, they'd have to feed them with beef or pork anyway from another animal.

Ou comment nier l'évidence pour faire un bon gros ""aucun vrai écossais"".

&gt;mise en oeuvre de techniques ayant pour but de créer, de maintenir ou d’exploiter chez une personne un état de sujétion psychologique ou physique, la privant d’une partie de son libre arbitre

Oui, c'est bien cela dont je parle à propos de l'UPR.

Quand on arrive à faire croire contre toute évidence à des gens que le FN n'est pas contre l'euro, alors que c'est l'argument n°1 pour effrayer les gens de droite, je pose sérieusement la capacité de libre-arbitre des membres de l'UPR.

&gt;il reproche qu'il n'y a pas un mot sur l'euro ou l'UE dans cette feuille A5 envoyé à des millions de Français et aux archives nationales.

Et bien c'est faux. La profession de foi est [ici](http://bureaudevote.fr/professiondefoi-lepen2012.htm). Je te laisse la lire ?

Je vais rétablir les Français dans leurs droits légitimes en recouvrant notre souveraineté nationale par la **remise à plat des traités européens**.

Remise  à plat des traités européens. Ensuite, tu vas dans le [programme présidentiel](http://www.frontnational.com/pdf/Programme.pdf), et tu lis :

**Dans le cadre de l’article 50 du Traité de l’Union Européenne, il convient d’initier une renégociation des
traités afin de rompre avec la construction européenne dogmatique en total échec.**

C'est très simple : si un nouveau traité qui contient les conditions du programme n'est pas signé, on sort de l'UE, comme le prévoit l'article 50.

&gt;l'euro n'est pas visible sur la propagande envoyée aux Français.

Et ? Ça n'est en rien un argument. L'euro est bien visible dans le programme et les discours.

&gt;Faux, il est impossible de sortir juridiquement de l'euro sans aussi quitter l'UE

C'est possible en changeant les traités. C'est d'ailleurs ce que propose le FN. Il va falloir arrêter de faire croire qu'on ne peut pas changer les traités.

&gt;Premièrement c'est flou au possible

Ce qui est flou, c'est le discours de l'UPR sur tous les sujets qui l'embête. L'UPR n'est pas un parti politique. L'UPR ne propose rien.

Le discours de l'UPR sur l'immigration :

L’UPR se conforme strictement à sa Charte fondatrice et aux opinions extrêmement variées de ses adhérents et sympathisants en **refusant de prendre une position plus tranchée sur les questions d’immigration**.

Sur la fiscalité ? Sur la répartition ? Sur tout ce qui est gouvernemental ? Rien. On refuse de prendre position.

true,_delirium,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; paternity leave is one of those reddit things that no one int he real world gives much of a fuck about

You obviously know fuck-all about the real world outside of your country, then. People here care a lot about paternity leave, and just about every father takes 3 months paid off, because it's considered basic normalcy that you take a bit of time off work when your own kid is born, since that's kind of an important life event (mothers usually take 9 months paid off). Many Danes who work in the U.S. actually move back to Denmark when they want to have kids, because there's so much more support for raising kids here.

&gt; Over 50% of the US federal budget alone is for entitlements and social programs.

Yes, 50% of a much smaller amount. U.S. government spending across all levels (national, state, local) is about half of Denmark's per capita. That's because the U.S. goes for a ""low-tax, low-services"" style of government, the opposite of the ""high-tax, high-services"" Nordic model.

&gt; all US cites are safe

Lol.

&gt; If you say things like this to people in the real world they will laugh at you.

I lived in Atlanta for 3 years, and Los Angeles for 4, among several other places. I can assure you, nobody laughed at the obvious truism that things were unsafe, especially in Atlanta, even though I lived in a *comparably* safe part of it (Midtown). More than one of my friends was mugged, and my car was broken into. I also have two friends who live in the Bronx, and they don't claim their neighborhood is safe, though they claim it's improved a lot from what it used to be. Even in nicer places than that, people are scared to walk anywhere at night alone, which is simply not the case here.

For one thing (as many here already mentioned), the numbers don't make sense. Sweden's only gas pipeline comes from Denmark. Yet, it is shown as using 100% Russian gas, with Denmark using 0%. In fact, Sweden has made a conscious choice not to invest in gas infrastructure on a large scale, exactly *because Putin* (with predecessors).

Secondly, the chart is showing the wrong thing. What matters is how much of your *total energy consumption* that comes from burning Russian gas. If a country's use of natural gas is negligible, but all of the small amount that it does use comes from Russia, the chart give the impression of that country being completely dependent on Russian gas, which of course is nonsense.

vielen Dank für Ihre Anfrage bezüglich zur Ahnenforschung Ihrer Familie („Bernhard C.L. Fick“ geb. 1862 in Ahrensbök). Wir werden uns in der nächsten Woche in unserem Museum treffen und dann besprechen, wie wir Ihnen weiter helfen können. Hierzu benötigen wir mehr Informationen zu Ihrer Familie, z.B. wo hat der Urgroßvater gewohnt?
Auch ein kleiner Anhaltspunkt kann für uns wichtig sein um dann besser forschen zu können.
Es besteht außerdem die Möglichkeit in einem Kirchen-Archiv in einem anderen Ort zu forschen. Hier sind dann alle Geburtsjahrgänge vor ca. 1880 von fast allen Ahrensbökern aufgelistet.
 
Zwei Frage interessieren uns noch: Fragen Sie aus dem Ausland an oder aus Deutschland? Wie sind Sie auf uns aufmerksam geworden?

As to why the 2.5 bn:    
&gt;Bilateral cooperation with countries in Latin America

&gt;In line with the Agenda for Change, the EU’s new policy blueprint to refocus its aid by priortising those sectors and countries where the need is greatest, the EU is setting up a new way to work with Latin America. For those countries which are facing the greatest challenges, bilateral cooperation will remain significant. But for those partner countries or regions where bilateral development cooperation is being discontinued, the EU will now be free to engage in a more strategic relationship, in which it seeks solutions on matters of common concern via regional cooperation, thematic programmes and new financial instruments. That’s why the EU’s regional funding will see such a significant increase; (nearly double) on amounts spent 2007 – 2013.
