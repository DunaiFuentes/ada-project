Granted federal governments can be very helpful in making grants for university research, but I am not sure this type of change is best to make at the Federal level. 

Looking at the US, many states have set up their own funds for helping technology entrepreneurs. New York City created half a billion dollar fund for new graduates from its technical campuses its building. These funds will help them start companies instead of going to work for large multinationals. It collaborated with universities in the US, Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Israel to make these campuses the best they can be. Most scientists (one of the campuses is biotech) are not good entrepreneurs, so at these schools they will be required to take 20% entrepreneurship classes, then have access to these funds to start companies after graduation. 

A old manufacturing city in upstate New York was trying to revitalize itself. It asked scientists why they dont usually start businesses, and they said labs were too expensive so they were forced to work for large corporations. This city built state of the art labs it lets scientists use for free as long as they form their businesses there. 

Texas has a half a billion dollar fund to support tech start-ups, and Austin is fondly named the Silicon Valley of the South. Chicago just invested in a $400 million high tech manufacturing hub (although some of that was federal funds). There are *tons* of these high tech hubs going up nation wide. 

Research hubs around universities are typically a state/university collaboration. The medical research hub around Harvard and MIT has some of the largest R&amp;D centers in the world, including for one of the largest French and Swiss pharmaceutical companies. Research Triangle Park in North Carolina is a similar story. It was a collaboration between the state and the University of NC. Now it has some of the largest research centers in the world. Including the largest research hub for British pharmaceutical GlaxoSmithKlein.

Their large scale empirical study of the European market, according to Hofstede dimension and some other scale I can't remember the name of, they could show that Nordic European countries seem the most responsive to breakthrough innovations whereas the Mediterranean countries with high levels of uncertainty avoidance and a low level of long term orientation are less likely to adopt such innovations spontaneously.

true,Britzer,BERL,Berlin,"So ganz stimme ich dem nicht zu. Die Finanzkrise war m.E. der Höhepunkt der größten Vermögensverschiebung in Deutschland seit 1923. Und es geht ja weiter. Aber das hat wenig direkt mit privater Verschuldung zu tun. Das lief vielleicht so in den 90ern. Damals haben gerade die Amis sich privat stark verschuldet und den Konsum ordentlich angekurbelt, was zu hohen Wachstumsraten führte. Viele sind dann einfach in die Privatinsolvenz. In Amiland haben sie auch viel saftigere Kreditkartenzinsen, weil es dort kaum Regulierung im Bankensektor gibt (Pump-and-Dump, eine bekannte und beliebte Methode Kreditkarten in den Markt zu drücken ist ein sehr geringer Zinssatz über ein paar Monate und diesen dann ohne Kommentar ordentlich anzuheben. Zum Beispiel von 5% auf 35% und ein paar Gebühren oben drauf. Für die Kündigung dann auch gleich US$150 oder so). Aber das klappt alles in Deutschland nicht so gut. Hier sind die Kreditzinsen häufig der reine Risikozinssatz. Es gibt ja bei der Privatverschuldung auch hohe Kosten. Deshalb kann man damit lange nicht so viel Geld machen. 

Was 2008 in die Hose ging waren Wetten. Die echten Schulden (Schulden der Konsumenten, viel Immobilien usw.) waren nicht mehr genug. Es wurden massiv Verträge mit Wetten über diese Schuldenpakete gehandelt. Es gab einfach nicht genug Schulden zu kaufen. 

Da hat also der aufgeblähte Finanzsektor jahrelang Profite mit Luft gemacht und unheimlich hoch gewettet. Die haben sich ja auch ganz viel Geld geborgt. Nicht verborgt!! Und mit sehr wenig eigenem und viel fremden Kapitals gezockt. Um die Eigenkapitalverzinsung zu erhöhen. Und dann haben sie sich so lange gegenseitig über den Tisch gezogen, bis die, die sich als dümmer herausstellten (Landesbanken, Commerzbank, Hypo Real Estate) plötzlich pleite waren. Und die wurden vom Staat gerettet. Das ""vernichtete"" Vermögen wurde vorher als Profit an die ""Gewinner"" ausgezahlt. Die 25% Eigenkapitalverzinsung die Ackermann mit seiner Deutschen Bank im Jahr anpeilte waren immer sehr verdächtig. Einem Softwarekonzern nehme ich das ab. Wenn ich X Euro in die Programmierung investiere und dann anfange die Software zu verkaufen, dann kann ich 200% Eigenkapitalverzinsung schaffen, wenn sich die Software rasend gut verkauft. Es gibt bei Software keine Kosten für die Kopie. Adobe, Microsoft und Oracle sind so Kandidaten. Aber eine Bank muss zocken, wenn sie so viel Geld ""erwirtschafen"" will. Und +25% in der Spielbank können leicht -100% werden. Es sei denn ich manipuliere das Spiel (siehe Libor-Skandal). 

Wie gesagt, irgendwann muss jemand für den aufgeblähten Finanzsektor und dessen Profite aus dem Nichts bezahlen. Und am Ende war das der Steuerzahler. Und dann gab es ja noch so Nebenschauplätze. Wie Griechenland. Dort wurde zum Beispiel mittels Bestechung das Militär mit deutscher Spitzentechnologie hochgerüstet. In einem beispiellosen Rüstungsprogramm. Für Milliarden von Euro. Auf Pump natürlich. Und jetzt zahlt der Steuerzahler für das Militärgerät. Wobei sich die Kosten in Grenzen halten. Denn es ist wie eine Subvention. Als wenn die Deutschen das Zeug gekauft hätten. Am Ende macht es ja wenig Unterschied wo die Panzer und Uboote vor sich hin rotten. Ob hier oder in Athen. Und damit werden deutsche Arbeitsplätze subventioniert. Da fließt viel Geld zurück in die Wirtschaft. Aber eben äußerst ineffizient. Denn viel Geld bleibt bei den Anteilseignern der Waffenschmieden hängen. Und auch ein wenig bei den geschmierten griechischen Beamten. 

Insgesamt gibt es in unseren extrem komplexen westlichen Wirtschaftssystemen inzwischen viele kleine Löcher und Möglichkeiten mit denen reiche Menschen reicher werden können, welche sich akkumuliert haben. Eine Folge einer stabilen Demokratie. Die, die so viel Macht und Geld haben, dass sie tatsächlich politischen Einfluß haben werden hier und da ein wenig die Gesetze beeinflussen. Immer hier ein bisschen und dort ein bisschen. Über die Jahre wird das ganze System dann immer günstiger für die, die vermögend sind und immer ungünstiger für die Habenichtse. Und es wagt sich da auch niemand heran. Denn es profitieren auch sehr viele unterschiedliche Gruppen davon. Es sind ja kleine Sachen hier und dort. Für Beamte zum Beispiel die private Krankenversicherung. Verdienen tun daran große Versicherungskonzerne. Aber wage sich bloß niemand daran. Der würde es mit den Ärzten zu tun bekommen, die hauptsächlich mit den Privatpatienten verdienen. Oder es glauben. Und die Beamten würden sich diese Versichrung auch nicht mehr nehmen lassen. Denn sie profitieren ebenfalls ein bisschen. Und so bekommen genug Gruppen etwas ab, damit so eine Geschichte bleibt. Und sehr bald in eine große Krise rutscht. Die Rücklagen der Versicherungen sind nämlich viel zu gering. Auch wegen der Finanzkrise. Da muss bald der Staat einspringen. Und schon wieder wurde Vermögen umsortiert. Erst wurde die Taschen der Versicherungen gefüllt und anschließend zahlt Papa Staat. 

Es sind eben die vielen ""kleinen"" Dinge. Aber hier in Deutschland bestimmt nicht das Plastikgeld. Auf das Auseinanderdriften von Arm und Reich, was ein großes Problem darstellt, gibt es keine einfache und direkte Antwort.

Mit Marx braucht man dort nicht zu kommen. Es ist einfach so: Wenn ich ein extrem komplexes System haben, was sich ständig leicht verändert, dann werden die einflussreicheren Spieler dieses System nach und nach zu ihren Gunsten verändern. Das geschiet sehr langsam. Nach und nach wird optimiert. Und die noch schlaueren Spieler beobachten vielleicht nur und analysieren, wie sie davon profitieren können. Geld ist schlau. Da ist kein böser Zirkel von Juden, der irgend etwas steuert. Nur eine Beamtenlobby, die eine Idee, die auf dem Papier gar nicht mal schlecht aussieht (private Krankenversicherung), für sich entdeckt und eine Versicherungswirtschaft, die dann dieses Gesetz so modifieziert, dass sie maximale Profite damit machen. 

Es sind die vielen kleinen Dinge. Es gibt viele kleine Lobbys und viele Gesetze hier und dort, die dann noch ein weng ""optimiert"" werden. Selbst die Gewerkschaften sind Teil dieses Systems. Die Parteien auch. Die einzelnen Abgeordneten dann wieder weniger. Das System ist hinreichend komplex.

I'd rather avoid such empty accusations.

You went on a speculative rant about nobody resisting the Russian military. To that speculation I presented you facts. Russians have had military stationed in Crime since always. And even the Estonians agree with my other point (the Estonian Minister has admitted this): neo-nazis have infiltrated and manipulated Ukraine's protests to their advantage.

The EU and the US are all calling Putin a nazi. Somehow, Godwin's Law has been suspended and it is now clever again to call anyone you disagree with a nazi. The US has troops in Germany. Russia has troops in Crimea. The history of both troops goes back to the same conflict. Deal with it.

And maybe Godwin's Law has been suspended in this sub just to let go unnoticed the fact that there are actual neo-nazis trying to cling to power in Ukraine right now. Neo-nazis taking this opportunity to exploit well-intended Ukrainians and get some share of power amidst all this confusion.

Mannheim is a generally industrial and commercial city, so there are few things that I feel are a must do in the city itself. The river walk is good. There is also a rotating restaurant in the television tower (space needle type tower) with some awesome views if the weather is good. 

Travel to Ladenburg, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladenburg) about 20min southeast (toward Heidelberg). Restaurant there called die Kartoffel (http://www.gasthaus-kartoffel-ladenburg.de/). 

It is my favorite restaurant on the planet. I recommend the Altbier. 

Ladenburg itself dates back to the Roman times. A gorgeous Altstadt with old wooden timber architecture and two great main churches. Walk along the river, see the old water tower, along with Carl Benz's (of Mercedes Benz) garage where he developed the first automobile.

It will still be a bit chilly, but there are many wineries in the area of Mannheim, most a short drive west of the city. I'm not certain if any will be open or have tastings this time of year.

There is also Weinheim (along the way to Ladenburg by rail if you take the correct line) which has a ton of nice little shops and a beautiful Altstadt. (http://wikitravel.org/en/Weinheim).

Taste : neutral
Safety, health : excellent

&gt;. do you watch how much water you use? if yes how?

Kinda. General habit of not wasting.

&gt;. do you know where the water comes from? where it goes? how it is treated? (no last minute googling please!)

Not really, as I live on the limit of two zones. In one zone, spring water is piped from Seine-et-Marne, in the other it's pumped from the Seine and processed. What comes from my tap is very neutral though, so I'd guess spring water.


&gt;. how likely you think it is that the water might be contaminated?

super highly unlikely

Yes. Continous quality control at many points of the supply chain.

Yes. I did some quick research a while ago and was globaly satisfied. And yes it *does* matter to know.

I ... had never ever thought about this before.

true,emmarose329,BAWU,Baden-Württemberg,"I lived in Mannheim for 6 months last year as a Universitaet Mannheim exchange student. It's an interesting little town, definitely! There's a lot of shopping in the city centre. There's a lovely garden and parks area near to the train station called der Wasserturm which you should definitely check out as well. 

One of my favorite spots to get a meal was the sushi restaurant right on Paradeplatz called The East. If you take the elevator outside of The East all the way up, you get to a very cool cocktail bar called Turmcafe and Cocktailbar Stars, where all of the drinks are crazy and named after various celebrities. There's also a great Indian restaurant near the Hauptbanhof (train station) at L14.

Something to know about Mannheim is that it's built in a grid system in the Quadrat, so it's actually pretty easy to get around. Just study a map for a bit before you go. The Universitaet and Schloss is right around the corner from the train station- the castle tour is definitely worth it! The tram system is definitely one of the easiest I've ever come across but they do periodically do random ticket checks so be wary of that.  

Like one of the previous posters said, I would definitely check out Heidelberg. It's just unbelievably cool and old- definitely be sure to check out all of the little shops as well as the Heidelberg castle ruins! 

Feel free to shoot me a PM if I can help with anything else! It's been over a year but I still remember a lot of places we used to frequent.

I don't think that's the right argument - armies are used by others (meaning other nations, pacts, organisations etc) anyway. No matter if we're talking about Balkans, Africa or Middle East missions. Every effort to take a collective security measures might be interpreted as ""others"". And frankly speaking, taxpayers are not really smart enough to judge which spending is the right one. A common citizen isn't happy if there's any spending that doesn't benefit them in the very direct way (and most likely the populist as well: hungry children, benefits for the poor, etc). Unless the conflict is rolling already, or is imminent to the point when any structural action is already to late to take, army does not provide such direct feeling of ""tax acomplishment"". 

As for the EU, the problem is of another kind. There's too many particularisms in this fantastic organisation. Unfortunately. On the one hand, countries are fighting each other to clutch as much from the EU budget and policies as possible, and see the organisation as the perfect forum for this. On the other, there are nationalist in every country, growing stronger every year, that wants whole organisation to dissapear. Using the examples of this particularism as their weapon.

This seems to apply to most news and entertainment media positions.

One must use varied news sources. And by *varied*, I don't mean FOX vs CNN (neoconservatism vs neoconservatism-*light*).  Incidentally, FOX barely pretends to be *news* anymore. It's to *news-coverage* what *pro-wrestling* is to sports. No, by *varied* I mean the BBC, then RT then Al Jazeera etc. (in terms of major English-language news outlets).

And keep in mind that most bias from media outlets is through their choices of what's ""*newsworthy*"" to cover. A fairly accurate picture of current-events can only emerge after also including some of the stuff that much work goes into characterising as ""*fringe*"". But that's a time-consuming minefield. Much of the stuff out there is mind-numbingly idiotic. Few are the completely independent fairly level-headed individuals who are both capable of serious analysis and willing to spend the time writing and publishing their thoughts.

Also some *bias* can be OK. The British magazine ""*The Economist*"" for example, can easily be characterised as ideologically ""*right-wing*"". But the thing is that it's quite often very  intelligent and clear and its writers do actually try to make rational arguments (instead of just *creating impressions, managing* news and  promoting the bias etc). 

In any case, the trick for *news*-information is to know who owns and manages specific news-and-entertainment networks. RT, for example, is not completely useless. However, it **is** essential to know that a pro-Russian top-management pressures employees on the narrative to present. Once aware of this, the bias in the coverage becomes rather obvious.

Si tu choisis un mec plus vieux et mieux placé socialement (phénomène d'hypergamie des femmes), il est très probable qu'il gagne plus.

Réciproquement, si un mec choisit plutôt des filles plus jeunes, il y a plus de chances qu'elles gagnent moins.

Si l’époux ou compagnon gagne davantage que sa femme, ce n’est pas qu’il profite en tant qu’homme d’une discrimination dont pâtirait de son côté sa compagne dans sa propre carrière. Il le doit, dans la configuration la plus fréquente des unions, au fait d’être par rapport à elle de qualification supérieure, ou au fait d’être un peu plus avancé dans la carrière parce que d’un âge plus élevé. Or c’est d’ailleurs largement pour ces caractéristiques qu’il a été élu sur le marché matrimonial.

Évidemment, il faudrait regarder de près les structures du marché matrimonial, mon expérience étant qu'il y a une prééminence féminine, si on regarde les taux de célibat subi, ils sont systématiquement plus importants pour les hommes des groupes sociaux inférieurs.

Quelques citations :

Dans deux couples sur trois, l’homme est plus 
âgé que la femme. La femme est plus âgée 
que l’homme dans deux cas sur dix environ, et 
dans un cas sur dix, les conjoints sont nés la 
même année.

Les frontières des groupes sociaux ne sont pas imperméables : un tiers des cadres ont épousé une employée. Mais ce phénomène fonctionne pour les hommes surtout du haut vers le bas de la hiérarchie sociale, et pour les femmes du bas vers le haut. Seuls 1,3 % et 2,9 % des employés ont épousé une femme cadre supérieur. C’est pour cela que les femmes très diplômées et les hommes peu qualifiés ont relativement plus de difficultés à trouver un conjoint.

Les femmes employées sont proportionnellement près de quatre fois plus nombreuses (24,4 % vs 6,9 %) que les hommes à s’unir à des cadres. Inversement, seules un tiers (32,2 %) des femmes cadres ont pour conjoint un employé ou profession intermédiaire, alors que cette proportion est double chez les hommes cadres (65,8 %). La prise en considération de la sous-représentation des femmes dans le groupe des cadres (six pour dix hommes en 1999, sept pour dix en 2010) ne suffit pas à effacer cette différence entre les sexes.",1,1394095352,null,0,1394096238,0,cfvq5ap,t3_1zpcyk,t1_cfvq5ap,t3_1zpcyk,null,1432681088,6,false,france,t5_2qhjz,6

true,DragonFly441,BAWU,Baden,"Currently studying material sciences in Aachen, so I can't really speak for the UK-Aachen but for general things about the city that should be enough.

I think for someone coming from LA, Aachen might almost be conidered as rural. For German standards public tranportaation is awful, as the city is only covered by busses that are unable to cope with the current demand, so if you want to ride a bus from the city center to the UK prepare for overcrowded busses and delay times up to 15 minutes.

As Aachen ist mostly known for its engineering courses expect some up- and downsides: extremely bad men/women ratio in the agegroup from 19-26; overall nerdiness; lots of activities for technology-affine people (My favorite is Akaflieg if you are interestet in airplanes); decent bars; abysmal nightclubs;

One huge negative that stands out for me is the number of bums sitting around, drinking, yelling and asking you for money, sometimes insulting you if you don't give them any change. Also expect a huge presence of bored teenagers from lower income families that can be quite hostily against students when drunk.

If you get tired of Aachen and want to see some nature the Ardennes and the Eifel are close by and if you want to party Köln is always an option as it is only a 45min train ride away.

When looking for a place to live in Aachen make sure to find one near to a busline that actually goes to the univerity hospital as it is in a remote area of town and the melaten campus itself has practically nothing besides student housing.

Aachen is a typical university town, although due to the focus on technical subjects, there is a slight lack of women. Going out is not expensive and you can pretty much get into any club, no matter how you're dressed (at least that was my experience). There are many nice restaurants and cafés all over town. I can recommend ""Café zum Mohren"" in the inner city, it has a great selection of cake and a nice atmosphere.
Aachen also has many good bakeries (sounds odd, but I really miss that part). You should try ""Reisfladen"", it's a pie with rice filling that tastes delicious.

The Dutch and Belgian borders are very close. From the university hospital, you can easily walk to the Netherlands. If you're looking for peanut butter, you won't be very happy with German supermarkets, but across the border, in Vaals, you can get all the peanut butter you want. If you're there, you should also get some vla, it's delicious. Maastricht is also worth a visit.   
Belgium has the best fries in the world (they invented them) and Liege is just about 40km away. It's not a pretty town, but it has flair and the difference in culture and architecture is amazing.

What I don't miss about Aachen is the weather. It's often cloudy and dark with drizzling rain, which can be a bit depressing. Also, people in Aachen may come across a little grumpy, just don't take it personally (I think it's because of the weather).",0,1394097808,null,0,false,0,cfvqklg,t3_1zp7df,t1_cfvqklg,t3_1zp7df,null,1432681287,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

Si j'ai bien compris le sens de ce que tu dis, cet état de fait est dû ""uniquement"":

- Les femmes, choisissent des hommes plus âgés, donc de par son age, le salaire du conjoint (homme) est supérieure.

- Les femmes, choisissent  des hommes plus diplômés (ou avec un poste plus important) donc le salaire de l'homme est plus élevé.

Un ""strike"" si elles choisissent un mec plus âge ET plus diplômé :)

Je pense que les hommes, réciproquement, choisissent aussi leur compagnes plus jeunes, ET/OU moins diplômées. C'est pas le fait des femmes uniquement.

La vrai question, si on admet cet état de fait, c'est pourquoi les hommes ET les femmes fonctionnent comme ça? Pourquoi un tel schéma continue à exister? 

Perso, je pense que les inégalités salariales, jouent un peu la dedans. C'est pas le point majeur évidemment ici, mais il y contribue même à très faible dose.

Would Russia?)*. Plus, the interests of European nations conflict to a huge degree in relation to defense and foreign policy, and despite the standardization brought by NATO, very strong differences/interests still exist, which Russia can exploit, not just militarily, but *(and probably more importantly)* diplomatically.**

Eh, keep in mind, Russia has nuclear weapons too, and is just as willing, if not more so, to use them than either yours or France's government. So let's ask ourselves, if the European Union loses a couple Eastern European member-states to Russian invasions, would they be willing to go to war with Russia and risk a nuclear confrontation over it? Also, if they did choose to do so, would either Russia or Europe want to go all out, or keep it a limited conflict restricted to the specified area? Would Russia or Europe be willing to go nuclear if they lost conventionally in a limited war? 

I mean, a nuclear deterrent helps, but it didn't end the Cold War, and it didn't stop us *(America)* from garrisoning the Fulda Gap and the Soviets from garrisoning a fuckton of troops in Eastern Europe. And it's a given that if World War III *did happen*, it would've started with a conventional Soviet invasion of Europe *(which from Soviet plans would've been supported by, but not dominated by, tactical nuclear weapons)*. 

A key part of the Soviet Plan was using the differences of European nations to their aid, with a specific focus on avoiding a attack on France in a attempt to keep them out of the war *(IIRC France had left NATO at this point)*. Although, I think we both know, chances are, if things did go bad, it'd in a massive nuclear strikes which would leave a irradiated apocalyptic wasteland. 

As for the rest? It doesn't mean shit when you're militarily divided and unwilling to sacrifice your own interests/security in the protection of another. Or concede authority to another country *(it's easy when you have a strongman like the United States, harder when you have equally sized nations like Germany, France, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom)*.

Putin has already outrun his analysis.

However if you live outside the city center and you need to use public transportation you are in for some trouble (overcrowded and not running late at night).

However, what I have come to hate (loved it in the beginning of my studies 10 years ago) is the flood of children (about 19 years old I would say) which come each new semester (8000 this semester). The university is quite famous for mechanical engineering and other technical courses thus in addition for a lot of stuff aimed at very young people (I am 29 but still consider myself young :) ) there a lot more males than females.


The city has about 240.000 inhabitants and the RWTH (biggest university, there are some more) has about 40.000 students just to give you an impression. So it is a good place to live and study depending on your age, sex and interests.

A priori, tout cela proviendrait du fait que la grossesse de la femme dure 9 mois. (comparé aux gestations de certains animaux qui sont beaucoup plus courte la plupart du temps) et qu'en général il n'y aura ""qu'un seul"" bébé/enfant.

Cela amènes les femmes à (très gros guillemets) ""ne pas porter la même importance a leurs enfants"" que les hommes. En tout cas, pas le même type d'importance et pas le même type d'attachement.

Des études on été faites la dessus, en fonction du temps de gestation, du sexe de l'animal qui s'occupe des enfants, de qui porte l'enfant, du nombre de bébé par portée, etc.

Ce qui fait qu'au final, ce que chercherait la femme dans un partenaire ""idéal"" (en général, et subconscient bien sur), c'est une personne qui s'occupera le mieux possible de ces enfants, et aussi, avec des moyens financiers assez conséquents. Ce qui se traduit la plupart du temps par une personne un peu plus âgé que la mère, puisqu'en général, plus ont été âgé, plus notre position sociale s'améliore.

Les choix des hommes ont été aussi analysés mais je vous passes les détails, c'est plus vraiment le même sujet.

true,yayachiken,NRW,Nordrhein-Westfalen,"It's... okay. I currently live in Aachen as a computer science student.

What bothers me most is public transport. I grew up around Düsseldorf, and there was a study about the public transport in the largest German cities, and Düsseldorf was on one of the lower places. Still, I love the transport there, when I come back from Aachen. The buses in Aachen are notorious for their lateness, they are overcrowded, the drivers are unfriendly... An initiative to build a tram along the trunk lines that could handle the masses of students was shot down by public vote because the city is completely broke, and even with funding help by the state it was questionable if the city would amass too much debt.

It's also quite hilly, so if you ride a bicycle and want to get anywhere comfortably, you will have a bad time. If you ride your bicycle for fun or exercise, it's absolutely great, especially if you go to the netherlands a few kilometers away! The climate is nice though. The last winter was quite nice, and the summer was warm but not too warm.

Cultural life is ""meh"" imo... Aachen has no real character as a city. The city marketing seems to compensate for this by putting Charlemagne everywhere, which is sometimes a bit ridiculous. You can go to the cinema, and that's about it. If you want to see theatre or opera, you rather escape to Cologne or Düsseldorf. Sometimes there are nice classical concerts though, even for free for students. Check the ads in the buses.

In addition, Aachen has a population of about 250.000 people or something, but the people act like they still live in a village, culturally and politically. If you are here for a longer time this might annoy you a bit...

If you like stargazing and astronomy, Aachen is wonderful. Just take a drive in the direction of Monschau and go to the Eifel region. Look for a place with no lights in the woods, and set up your camp for the night. We have some of the darkest places in NRW here. As someone from LA you will probably be shocked how many stars there are in the nightsky, thousands of stars are visible with the naked eye, even more with binoculars. :-)

Another thing that will be nice for you is that you get the best of many cultures as both the Netherlands and Belgium are just a few kilometers away (really, reachable by bike).

If you don't mind ""dirtier"" locations, you should check out the clubs around Optimolwerke, next to Ostbahnhof (Clubs like Grinsekatze and others, the sound is usually much harder than at Stachus)

&gt;Je pense que les hommes, réciproquement, choisissent aussi leur compagnes plus jeunes, ET/OU moins diplômées. C'est pas le fait des femmes uniquement.

Absolument, il y a des traditions détestables, notamment chez les classes défavorisées et certains immigrés, qui consistent à choisir une fille jeune et à la mettre au foyer le plus vite possible. On constate cela en regardant les ages moyens de mariage ou de premier enfant, ainsi que les statistiques d'endogamie dont j'ai déjà abondamment parlé (chiffres disponibles sur demande).

Ensuite, il y a un phénomène cruel d'attractivité (qui serait peut-être lié à la fertilité) : les jeunes seraient plus désirées que les femmes plus âgées, parait-il, l'inverse étant moins évident (probablement à cause de George Clooney). Ceci étant aggravé par la ménopause, qui n'a rien d'une discrimination socialement construite (pour l'instant, je ne doute pas qu'on exhibe dans un futur proche des cas qui montreraient l'influence des stéréotypes sociaux sur la ménopause, avec à la clé des XYZ de l'Égalité chez les retraités /s).

Cela dit, ça ne change pas le fait que l'offre de femmes en âge de procréer est plus faible que la demande, confirmant ainsi la situation favorable desdites jeunes femmes.

&gt;La vrai question, si on admet cet état de fait, c'est pourquoi les hommes ET les femmes fonctionnent comme ça? Pourquoi un tel schéma continue à exister?

La théorie classique soutient que ce sont des stratégies de sélection sexuelle et de reproduction : 

- les hommes cherchent du sexe avec des femmes les plus fertiles, tout en essayant de garantir la paternité des futurs enfants (exclusivité sexuelle, tendance à vouloir être un facteur d'amélioration des conditions matérielles, à vouloir ""protéger"" etc.).
- les femmes choisissent les hommes les plus fertiles et les plus à même d'assurer un avenir à leur progéniture (critères physiques de virilité, taille, richesse, culture)
- les hommes consacrent beaucoup de temps et de moyens à éliminer les autres hommes (jeunes, pauvres et timides) de la compétition sexuelle

&gt; Dieu existe, c'est donc lui qui a orchestré tout ça. A sa place, je rigolerai moins ou alors très discrètement :o

First to blame: removal of the social net, deposession of its industries and companies by a west eager to acquire them (definitely will happen to Ukraine), which will worsen the situation for the workforce.

And that's not even getting into the EU integration's crazy conditions. Some: massive devaluation of the currency, removal of a lot of social protection measures, privatization of a large part of state-owned companies whose operation by the state is what kept them from collapsing (think of UK's rail system as example, its falling apart after the gov sold it to greedy vultures), requirement to take large loans with high interests if late repaid (see Greece, it's definitely happening to Ukraine all the same expect sooner, Greece just delayed the inevitable and now struggles to just repay the interest, imposing inhumane levels of austerity on its population.

That is the problem with purely population-centric methods of sovereignty; you can simply move populations around. And we saw in the Balklans conflict how such line of thought can get really ugly. 

Thus if the Crimeans wanted full autonomy, then they could have easily negotiated it with Ukraine: ""Listen to our demands or we break away"" is a very strong lever, as Scotland has shown already. And, of course, let us not forget that the decision to join the Russian Federation was made bureaucratically and the unanimous decision is a bit suspect to say the least. While sentiments against the Ukrainian governments are there, let us not forget that I doubt that the 12% Tartars, 24% Ukranians and a portion of the remaining Russian population would be fully convinced of passing sovereignty to an equally bureaucratic Russia. 

Thus there is a necessity for proper dialogue and negotiation in the transition of sovereignty to ensure change that will last, is a win-win for both parties and cause the least trouble. Instead we had a very suspicious defection with a significant section of the Crimea's population left in the dark and a very good excuse for the Ukranian far-right to be inflamed and actually popularised. Ironic in the end that the Russians themselves would create the very conditions, where the *neo-nazi enemy* they imagined and feared, would actually thrive under.

I think it is important to have some balance and I have to say a lot of our media has been very propagandist over this crisis in almost exclusively covering one side of the conflict. I do also broadly agree with his last paragraph on what needs to be done but would add Russian forces should be withdrawn as well.

Saying this though I really wouldn't say this is a good article as it is too forgiving of the Russians and really just becomes a bashing of western government policy, which does have a small amount of merit but is overly concentrated on here with some gross misrepresentations.

---

&gt;**Birth control**, also known as **contraception** and **fertility control**, are methods or devices used to prevent [pregnancy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy).  Planning, provision and use of birth control is called [family planning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning).   [Safe sex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_sex), such as the use of male or [female condoms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_condom), can also help prevent [sexually transmitted infections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_infections).   Birth control methods have been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods only became available in the 20th century.  Some cultures deliberately limit access to birth control because they consider it to be morally or politically undesirable.

European manufacturers are still targeting commuters and households' second cars, which typically can do with a much shorter range.  
Longer range means more batteries, resulting in more weight and a much higher cost. The established manufacturers have decided that it's better to leave the niche market of long range electric cars to Tesla, and focus on shorter range but cheaper cars first. Another reason might be that they want to wait until they have practical experience with batteries' durability before risking a giant PR disaster with a too expensive callback to replace failing batteries. Tesla has much less to lose.

That they're somehow incapable of putting more batteries into their vehicles most certainly isn't the reason.

I completely agree with this, but there's a crucial difference. Crimea is majority ethnic Russian to begin with. If Russia has been emigrating Russians from RF to Crimea then the referendum would be invalid in my opinion (its a clear attempt to sway it). If the Crimean population hasn't been artificially altered in the past few weeks/months, then I don't see what would be wrong with it.

&gt;While sentiments against the Ukrainian governments are there, let us not forget that I doubt that the 12% Tartars, 24% Ukranians and a portion of the remaining Russian population would be fully convinced of passing sovereignty to an equally bureaucratic Russia.

Yugoslavia collapses in the 1990s; *What shall we use as a measure of sovereignty? Ethnicity of course.* And then people are surprised that armed bands are going around, redrawing borders by murdering anyone who is *not us*.

And even today Israel, a state that should have known better, is now in the sharp end of a national model based on ethnicity. Should deportations follow to preserve a majority of Jews in the only Jewish state?

Indeed the Ukrainians and Russians have so much shared history and heritage that it would be folly to draw a solid and mutually exclusive distinction between the two.

To my knowledge, there are no fixed-line prepaid end user operators. You would have to sign a contract (usually binding for 24 months) and pay penalties (around 100 euro) after 5 months for termination. 

there are however at least two nation-wide minor operators who offer prepaid dsl contracts: one is **aruba**: http://adsl.aruba.it/

which offers prepaid contract of minimum 3 months length, and is a 'reseller' of TelecomItalia business lines, the other is NGI:

http://www.ngi.it/it/connettivita/formula-intro/

but I'm seeing that now NGI is only offering 12-months prepaid contracts. It would be cheaper to sign for a montly-paid 24 months contract and pay the penalties after 6 months. 

anyway, MOBILE operators are offering pre-paid internet.

vodafone is offering a prepaid 1 year data service for 99 euros, with a free 3g-to-wifi modem. The data cap is 3gb per month. be careful, if you were to chose this alternative, to explicitly ask for the prepaid version of the offer and not for the contract.

We're headed for that direction in Norway as well. The government (or rather the government-connected) negotiators want to take away the long vacation for teachers. Which sounds fine in theory, if you don't know how the system actually works here. 

Half of the summer vacation is the same as everyone else's, and the other half is not technically a vacation, but ""pay"" for all the extra work teachers do during the school year outside of the actual school.

Now they want teachers to spend that time in school. During summer. *When there are no students there*. Which will a) be good for next to nothing in itself and b) lead to one of two situations, depending on the teacher. Some teachers will still do the same work, except now they are working more than they used to because all that ""vacation"" they had is now work time. Many will burn themselves out. 

Others, good teachers who are otherwise able to separate their job from their free time will simply stop working when their day ends, and be completely justified in doing it. No matter which it is, it will hurt the students.

Die BVG zum Beispiel hat bundesweit die höchsten Kosten pro Fahrgastkilometer. Gleichzeitig ist die BVG das größte öffentlich Nahverkehrsunternehmen in Deutschland. Wir reden hier von negativen Skalenerträgen. Je mehr Fahrgastkilometer, desto teurer?? 

Also dachte man, dass es effizenter ist, wenn der Staat nicht mehr selbst durchführt, sondern ausschreibt. Nur haben sie nicht bedacht, dass Beamte, die vorher schon bei der Ausführung ineffizient waren nun beim Verwalten der fremden Steuerzahlergelder ebenso unbedarft sind und sich bei den Verträgen bestechen und/oder über den Tisch ziehen lassen, bzw. hinterher nicht ordentlich kontrollieren. Die Vertragskosten (Kosten die dadurch entstehen, dass man etwas am Markt outsourct, anstelle es selber zu machen entstehen hauptsächlich deshalb, weil man bei internen Partnern davon ausgeht, dass die einen schlecht über den Tisch ziehen können, weil ja über beiden Parteien die gemeinsame Leitung sitzt, während bei externen Partnern Verträge ausgehandelt werden müssen, die dem entsprechen müssen, was man will und deren Einhaltung überprüft werden muss) waren und sind erschreckend viel höher als gedacht. Dummes Beispiel: Ich schreibe eine Entsorgung aus und im Vertrag steht dann, dass die Entsorger den Müll nicht einfach in den See kippen dürfen. Also kippen sie den Müll einfach in den Wald. Ist ihnen ja nach Vertrag nicht verboten... Im nächsten Jahr wird das dann nachkorrigiert mit entsprechenden Kosten für die Kommune. Und dann kippt der Entsorger eben ins Meer. 

Wie man es macht, macht man es falsch. Ich kenne so einige Personen im Staatsbetrieb (Beamte), die darüber stöhnen wie schlimm es ist, dass Leistung bestraft wird und wie nervenzereibend es ist die Zeit todzuschlagen und möglichst ineffizient zu arbeiten. Oder eben am Ende vom Jahr noch schnell jeden möglichen Schrott zu bestellen, damit das Budget ausgereizt wird.

Wie man es macht, macht man es falsch.

Was die BVG gemacht hat war Cross Border Leasing, was mal Schule gemacht hat, weil es über Tricks ein paar Steuerrückzahlungen aus den USA gab. Es ging darum kommunale Wertgegenstände in die USA zu verkaufen (an eigens gegründete Briefkastenfirmen) und diese dann zurückzuleasen. Verdient haben daran am meisten die Vermittler. Das sind Investment-Banken aus New York. Und so haben sich einige Beamte (der Staat ist ja besser als privat...) für ganz schlau gehalten und gedacht, sie könnten den amerikanischen Steuerzahler überlisten. Nur haben die Investmentbanken, die ihnen das aufgeschwatzt haben, nicht nur das meiste Geld vorneweg kassiert, was hinterher ""verdient"" werden sollte, sie haben sich auch gegen Verluste abgesichert.

They are not mutually exclusive objectives.

Do you mean it's not worth taking what could have happened if Communism had gained more ground? I think it's worth considering such implications when you're discussing action that Kissinger took..

How much more of Asia would have fallen under the iron curtain of communism had it not been nipped in the butt in Vietnam? How would nuclear arms have proliferated? Etc.

Kissinger might have suggest policies that ended up killing hundreds of thousands (Abstractly, millions) of people but there was huge tension with the Soviet Union in the mid 60's to early 70's and any way you look at it he *did* ease those tensions.. Even if it was all eventually undone by Reagan a few years later.

If there was a true and valid process of self-representation, then the process would have been more drawn out and more thorough. Proper negotiations would have been held with the Ukranians for a reasonable transition. Instead Ukranian troops will be suddenly stranded and Ukranian citizens in the Crimea suddenly unrepresented. 

Furthermore if given the chance, political factions within Crimea itself would have risen to make their cases; Ukranians and Tatars, that have previously voted for the Party of Regions whom they perceived as moderates in Crimean autonomy, I am certain would have a thing or two to say against handing over sovereignty to the Russians. Similarly to how the Better Together campaign arose in response to calls for Scottish independence.

Plus I am sure the Ukranian government would be willing to give the choice of compromise, in a similar manner to how the British government is in relation with the Scottish referendum. 

It is, after all, not a coincidence that the Scottish bid for independence is an affair that is taking years upon years.

**One click hoster:** safe, but if you don't want to pay there will probably be some waiting involved in between downloading parts

**Streams:** safe, you'll have no problems watching episodes without paying a dime. Don't expect full hd quality, but it's usually good enough (depending on the hoster I suppose).

Walk up the Trocadero to have a very nice view of Paris with the Eiffel Tower. Then just sit at a café, and finally go back to CDG.

You don't want to go very far from CDG ? You could visit the Air/Space museum in ""Le Bourget"". Very close to CDG by train and bus, and if you're into that kind of stuff very nice to see ! (old planes, space capsules, 2 Concordes you can visit, an Ariane5 replica...).

I would personally recommend the ""Jardin du Luxembourg"" (+ direct train from CDG) which is also in a nice area that you could visit at the same time. The ""Parc des Buttes de Chaumont"" is also very nice if the weather is good. Some small lakes, little hills. An awesome picnic place!

Finally, there is also the ""Parc de la Villette"" which is, you guessed it, a park. There is also the ""Cité des Sciences"" at the same place, which is basically a big building with a lot of different science related exhibitions (and other stuff : you can visit an old submarine, there is an IMAX cinema I think...).

Et puis même dans un contexte contemporain, on parle d'ultra-gauche depuis la décolonisation dans les services de surveillance/sécurité français, et c'est en 2014 que la formule te choque ?  

&gt;Pourquoi Soral est aussi écouté ? Pourquoi Soral est aussi populaire chez les jeunes d'origines immigré ? Pourquoi la France black-blanc-beur rêvé par la gauche se trouve dans les salles de Dieudonné ? Quand est-ce que les journalistes vont commencer à se poser les bonnes questions ?

Par ce que les jeunes d'origines immigrés sont pauvres et que les pauvres sont bêtes. C'est méchant, mais quand t'es bête, tu fais pas d'études et t'apprends moins à avoir un recul critique. 
Le complotisme soralien, c'est une recette pas très compliquée : tu affirmes quelque chose, et :

- si on t'oppose un contre-argument, tu dis qu'il a été construit exprès pour que tu ne sois pas pris au sérieux

- Si on te dit que décidemment, c'est trop évident et pas assez crédible, tu dis que justement, c'est fait exprès par ce que ""plus c'est gros, plus ça passe"".

The crucial issue for me is that both sides have reason to feel aggrieved. The Scottish scenario by comparison, is not like that.

&gt; Ukranian troops will be suddenly stranded and Ukranian citizens in the Crimea suddenly unrepresented.

I agree with this. I would add though, that the ethnic Russian part of Crimea perhaps have good reason to feel aggrieved too. Yanukovych had been toppled for around 24 hours when Russian was downgraded as an official language. That's only one thing, and is of course tiny in comparison to a military occupation, but its a bad sign.

Das eine ist ja, wenn man seine Herkunft gerne *kennen* möchte. Das andere ist, wenn man dieser nun gekannten Herkunft, zu der man im übrigen nichts beigetragen hat, eine besondere Bedeutung beimisst. Und nicht nur eine Bedeutung, sondern womöglich sogar eine Art metaphysische Segenskraft.

Da kommt man ganz schnell in jene Richtung, wo es dann heißt: ""Ich bin stolz, ein Xxxx zu sein!"".
Und andere aufgrund ihrer Herkunft, Abstammung oder den Umständen ihrer Zeugung zu verachten, das bezeichnete man früher gemeinhin als ""Rassismus"".

Was man sich aber dann schon fragt, ist, wie eine Tusnelda mit derart kruden Ansichten es schaffen kann, einen Literaturpreis zu kriegen. Da sollte man die Kriterien vielleicht auch noch mal ein wenig hinterfragen.

&gt;The Island was a British Military and Naval station directly opposite the Zone. England holds the Island on yearly rent-free lease, and every year the Lease and Permit of Residence is formally renewed. The entire population turns out-attendance is compulsory-and gathers at the municipal dump. The President of the Island is required by custom to crawl across the garbage on his stomach and deliver the Permit of Residence and Renewal of the Lease, signed by every citizen of the Island, to The Resident Governor who stands resplendent in dress uniform. The Governor takes the permit and shoves it into his coat pocket: 

&gt;""Well,"" he says with a tight smile, ""so you've decided to let us stay another year have you? Very good of you. And everyone is happy about it? ... Is there anyone who isn't happy about it?""

&gt;Soldiers in jeeps sweep mounted machine guns back and forth across the crowd with a slow, searching movement. 

&gt;""Everybody happy. Well that's fine."" He turns jovially to the prostrate President. ""I'll keep your papers in case I get caught short. Haw haw haw."" His loud, metallic laugh rings out across the dump, and the crowd laughs with him under the searching guns.

If you are in a group you should be ok. 

The nature is very pretty including the Nordschwarzwald and the city works at modernizing its 50th Concrete look.

You can always drive to Karlsruhe with the train or car it isnt too far away and has a better party scene and is a lot more laid back.

The FH has a very nice view over the city and is near a ""Zoo"" the Pforzheimer Wildpark which is a zoo for mostly native animals or animals who like our climate.

Pforzheim has a lot of hills and if you arent fit you should drive with the bus or car. especially if you want to drive from the city to the FH.

It has one of the highest amounts of Dönerläden/km² in Germany so i hope you like that ^ ^

true,Nemo84,BELG,Belgium,"&gt; Ah yes, it was after all disputed by the Russian propaganda channels - if you find those credible. And the shooting of medics by snipers - totally called for.

Really? Because I was basing myself on reports here in the Belgian media, on the well-known Russian propaganda channel known as the [VRT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlaamse_Radio-_en_Televisieomroeporganisatie). For example [here is a very lovely article describing how a local Flemish company near the rioting was torched by protestors on 19 February, with the civilians present in the building barely escaping in time.](http://www.deredactie.be/permalink/2.31561?eid=1.1882904)

It would have been very sad days for the Danish media if they have not shown the same objectivity in their own reporting.

&gt; That quickly changed when the murders committed by the Yanukovych government began

Source? And how about the 16 or more ""murdered"" policemen?

&gt; Probably very necessary moves to remove the corrupt judges of the old regime. Holding one election at a time is perfectly democratic.

Or a consolidation of power by eliminating political opponents. The democratic move would be to first hold democratic elections for the entire government and parliament, and then let the democratically elected government deal with possible corruption.

&gt; Uhuh. Keep eating that Russian propaganda. They were packing military hardware strangely reminiscent of the Russian army. But no, that's just a coincidence.

Weapons can be freely bought or supplied. Still doesn't prove either their nationality nor their intentions. Given that the ukrainian response to the declaration of the referendum today was to order the arrest of several Crimean government officials, I can somewhat understand the Crimean government wanting protection first.

But the way to address them is dialogue, consideration and time; none of which are being allowed by the Crimean government. I am all for self-determination, but only by the proper means. Otherwise it would end up undermining the very principle of self-determination. Indeed the Crimean conduct with the international community has so far been questionable; a UN envoy was held hostage briefly just yesterday and apparently OSCE observers are being denied access altogether. 

The Crimean government went at it in all the wrong ways and its intentions I'm afraid strongly indicate that it is was under elitist initiative to transfer Crimea to Russian control; without a doubt the same people were promised positions of power within the Russian Federation and threatened with hostile action if they acted otherwise. There are indications of the same in other Ukranian regions bordering Russia. Thus it is not surprising that the whole affair generated minute international sympathy. Even China, which often sides with Russia or expresses neutrality in geopolitical affairs, was forced to accept that the whole affair was a clear infringement in Ukraine's sovereignty. 

If the Crimeans wanted independence, they could have conducted it by more legitimate means. They could have participated in the coming Ukranian elections in order to elect representatives for a government they can recognise. From then they could have started the process of self-determination without even the need of Russian involvement. Indeed if the Russians were patient and waited for such an outcome, international sentiment would be more sympathetic and European reaction would be more divided. That the EU expressed nearly unanimous disapproval to the affair is rather the exception, not the norm. 

But in the end I can't but help feeling that this will not end well for all parties. I guess the Ukrainians would be the clearest losers from the whole affair; battered beyond what was necessary. But even with Crimea and the other Ukranian regions in question I can't but help but feel that in a few years they will notice that they have replaced a corrupt administration with another, and that their calls for change would be even weaker and deafer than is possible at present. And even with Russia one has to put thought into the consequences of building up an ever more extensive network of regions that would eventually make it even harder for the Russians to keep their country together whenever times would get tough and the calls for further autonomy throughout Russia would get louder. We often forget that Russia is a very fragile federation only held together by the very force the Russian state can afford at the moment by providence of stability.  

Consequences, I guess, are their most obscure when the act is carried out. But when they become clear and apparent, they simply become inevitable. And the consequences associated with all this are most ugly. ",0,1394118691,null,0,false,0,cfvv2hu,t3_1zpkhx,t1_cfvv2hu,t1_cfvu7di,null,1432683479,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

On the most basic level, cutting around 11% of trade and 7% of exports would be terrible. The source you provide quotes over €123 billion in exports to Russia. Taking anywhere near that much out of our economy would hurt a lot (obviously some countries more than others depending on their individual exposure). I don't care whether it hurts Russia more or less, it would hurt the EU more than enough.

What I just said discounted the fact that most of what we import from Russia is gas. Correct me if I'm wrong, but people seem naive in thinking gas is only used for heating our homes. Gas also powers the electricity we use everyday. Consider how much electricity we use everyday. Not just on a personal level, but in factories, offices, in public services such as hospitals and traffic lights. Yes there are other sources, but they aren't instantly available. A massive reduction in gas means a massive reduction in industrial output. Why do you think Germany has hitherto been very quiet?

Whilst on the topic of German silence, it also pays to not rush into extreme solutions. The USA is far more powerful and far less reliant on Russia than the EU. It therefore holds that the USA would be best placed to implement stronger sanctions. Yet they are pushing for some economic and trade sanctions. Bad sure, but not the economy crippling solutions some people seem to want. Do you not think that an attempt to cripple the Russian economy might be a bad idea in the long-run?

Georgia claimed that it was responding to attacks on its peacekeepers and villages in South Ossetia, and that Russia was moving non-peacekeeping units into the country. The Georgian attack caused casualties among Russian peacekeepers, who resisted the assault along with Ossetian militia. Georgia successfully captured most of Tskhinvali within hours. Russia reacted by deploying units of the Russian 58th Army and Russian Airborne Troops into South Ossetia one day later, and launched airstrikes against Georgian forces in South Ossetia and military and logistical targets in Georgia proper.

I'm not aware of a similar offering from both wind (mobile) and wind-infostrada (dsl)

The contract with wind-infostrada is not binding, but beware, you would have to pay penalties. Other operators (eg, TelecomItalia, Fastweb) will offer you to 'activate' the line for free instead of paying 99 euros (for example), if you stay with them for two years. 

If you recede before 24 months, they will bill you (and you don't always know when, they bill every 2 months) for the 'activation' fee: the 'discount' was valid only if you were to stay with them for 2 years.

this is to get around the fact that termination fees are illegal.

BEWARE that wind-infostrada is THE SAME, they'll ask you 'late activation fees' when you terminate the contract, only, they'll do it even after 10 years. 
Look at article 15 of the contract: https://www.infostrada.it/area155/155FaiDaTe/155/moduli/CGC_Servizi_Telefonia_ADSL_gen_14.pdf
(yeah, that's in italian).

also, never accept 'bundled' modems/routers, because any isp will find a way to make you suffer when you terminate the contract with them. Buy a generic modem at a store.


did she say with which operator the landline is? 
the current operator (probably the incumbent) will almost immediately activate the dsl offer, but subscribing a contract with a third-party isp would take even 1 month (eg, for number portability), and the homeowner wouldn't be happy.

You could however have a SECOND phone line installed for dsl service with any ISP you want, so you wouldn't be interfering with the homeowner line/contract. This is done for 90 euros with any isp (the 'last mile' is property of telecomitalia which physically installs the second phone line).

aruba should permit you to have a second line installed in your name and provide a pre-paid (min. 3 months) 20/1mbps service (or 7/0.384m service if you are unlucky) ",0,1394120959,null,0,1394121485,0,cfvvzne,t3_1zpnj1,t1_cfvvzne,t1_cfvux5d,null,1432683905,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

Single man? There is a well-documented case (Dmytro Bulatov, Lithuanian clinic found evidence of torture, you can look it up). Countless hundreds of people were brutally beaten, both visibly on camera and while in custody, which is also quite clearly torture under any reasonable definition. People like Yuriy Verbytsky were tortured and then left to die in the cold, as witnessed by his companion who was not killed but also tortured, named Ihor Lutsenko. I'm giving you names here so you can google them and see for yourself.

&gt;However the interim government in the mean time has been replacing a lot of non-elected officials, such as 5 constitutional court judges. Not very democratic moves.

The parliament did this. It is legitimate.

No evidence of anything exists, no evidence that the vote took place at all. No video.

Officially, WW2 was also started by a dastardly Polish provocation and murder of German border guards in Gleiwitz.

Georgia tried to recapture South Ossetia from what was essentially Russian occupation (or, alternatively, a Russian ""peacekeeping mission""). Georgia miscalculated the situation, and Russia seized the opportunity to effectively annex South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

Afghanistan under the Taliban provided a safe harbor for an organisation that claimed responsibility for the attacks on the United States. The Taliban apparently believed that by arguing that America couldn't present cold and hard proof that Osama bin Laden was behind the 9/11 attacks, they could prevent an attack. However, they miscalculated the situation, and the United States seized the opportunity to invade and occupy Afghanistan - which was curiously in line with the kind of foreign policy that [high-ranking members of the new Bush administration had been advocating for a long time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project\_for\_the\_New\_American\_Century).

Here's the thing, though: Georgia handed Russia the opportunity by initiating military action. Ukraine, on the other hand, didn't do anything like that.

b) **All ethnic Russians and russophones support what Russia is doing.** That's just silly, as there are plentiful examples to the opposite from Crimea, from Ukraine and from within Russia itself.

Just like during the Euromaidan, before the revolution phase of it. If Yanukovych simply announced elections and a rock-solid way of making sure they're fair (e.g. letting an outside entity conduct it), the vast majority of protesters would have to go home, or appear as un-democratic rioters and supporters of an illegal coup. And then on top of everything, if Yanukovych won fair and square, the opposition would be politically dead for years.

But of course that's not what happened, because he's not stupid and he knew he'd lose.

It should not be too hard to find some friends among the people you are in the same class with. Speaking German helps with this of course, but being a foreigner can also be a positive in this. 

I remember when I went to university for my first semester, it was the first time that I had regular contact to people from many different places in the world. That makes things a bit more interesting.

So don't be afraid that you will be all alone in Germany and none will want to speak to you. You will have plenty of contact with your peers in uni, and there are always a lot of parties that are thrown to give everybody a chance to get to know the other students.

Europe consumes about about 17 Petajoule worth of natural gas annually.

That's about what we send away currently. So if we stopped getting any gas from Russia and stopped exporting anything, we'd be short about 2% of our usual consumption.

The EU has strategic gas reservces worth 90 days of full consumption, so if we don't open up any new sources and don't lower our consumption one bit, we'd last more than 10 years. Speaking of gas consumption, that one has been going down for some time.

All statistics come from [this](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Natural_gas_consumption_statistics) article, so it's actually just one source. Reader beware. Assuming it's right, one should also take into account that the money we lose from exporting gas also wouldn't have to be spent to import gas either. The largest problem would probably be the infrastructure to get the gas around, though I imagine we can use the pipes that currently come from eastern europe, to pump gas to eastern europe.

Culs-tendus pour les uns, fervents défenseurs de notre identité langagière pour les autres... il doit quand même y avoir un juste milieu. Je suis moi-même dans les langues depuis longtemps mais je n'arrive pas à prendre cette institution au sérieux, probablement parce que je me passionne pour la langue qui les effraie tant.

Si So*t*chi avait été au cœur d'un petit fait divers sans importance, une erreur de translittération serait passée inaperçue, mais le tapage médiatique autour des JO oblige(rait) effectivement les journalistes à une recherche un peu sérieuse. Mais qui écrit les articles sur les JO ? Les petits stagiaires qui doivent pondre de l'article au kilomètre ou des grands reporters qui ont le temps (ou les stagiaires, justement) pour faire des recherches plus approfondies ? Je ne pense pas que ça soit ces derniers.... Je pense honnêtement que ce *t* qui s'est fait la malle n'a pas été écrasé par une énième avancée du rouleau compresseur britannique, je pense qu'il a simplement été oublié, puis l'orthographe a été reprise et on connaît la suite. Et quand on voit écrit *Sochi* sur tous les écrans à longueur de journée, l'erreur est vite faite.

Un jour, un coloc' m'a raconté qu'il avait été à une conférence sur l'entrepreneuriat où le *businessman* a terminé en lisant sur son *smartphone* : ""Rappelez-vous, il faut être *smart* pour être *successful* dans son entreprise"" (véridique, avec l'accent français qu'on aime tant). Alors bon, oui, il y a des abus. Certainement plus à l'oral qu'à l'écrit, mais il faut arrêter de crier haro sur l'anglais pour des noms propres russes qui ont été mal écrits parce qu'on a recopié l'orthographe anglophone alors qu'il y en avait une française... Y a des limites.

Tout le monde n'a pas la sagesse de quelqu'un de l'Académie française, tout le monde n'a pas lu Tolstoï ou Bounine ou Pasternak, et tout le monde n'a pas les yeux qui saignent en voyant ""Sochi"" au lieu de ""Sotchi"". Moi j'ai vu les deux, je me suis étonné un peu, et je me suis dit qu'il devait y en avoir un qui avait fait une faute.

Je suis curieux de savoir ce que les gens de /r/france en pensent.

*Ninja edit* (prends ça, l'Académie française) : j'ajoute à mon roman la remarque suivante : parler de ""Désinvolture, minceur du bagage culturel, soumission aux modes"" après avoir fait des références obscures (pour moi) durant tout un paragraphe témoigne d'une suffisance, d'une prétention que je ne peux qu'interpréter comme le sentiment de supériorité de cette institution que beaucoup disent vieillissante et démodée. Faut péter un coup, c'est pas parce que je préfère Harry Potter à Anna Karenine que je suis un ignorant.

Übereinkunft zwischen wem? Wer stimmt da mit überein. Die estländische Regierung? Die NATO? Irgendwie fehlen ein paar wichtige Informationen von Seiten Herrn Paet's.

&gt; Olga Bogomolets hat in einem Interview mit dem britischen Teleghraph mittlerweile dementiert, dem estländischen Minister gegenüber diese Aussage gemacht zu haben. „Ich selbst habe nur Demonstranten gesehen. Ich weiss nicht, welche Art Wunden das Militärpersonal erlitten hat“, erzählt sie dem Telegraph. „Ich habe keinen Zugang zu diesen Leuten.“

D.h. **die** entscheidende Behauptung (dass sowohl Polizei, als auch Demonstranten von den gleichen Scharfschützen beschossen wurden) ist in keiner Weise belegt? Also entweder sagt die Frau Bogomolets oder Herr Paet die Unwahrheit.

Ich habe weniger Probleme zu glauben, dass eine Euro-Maidan-Ärztin keinen Zugang zu verwundetem Polizeipersonal bekommt, als dass diese Ärztin auf einmal einen Rückzieher macht und das Gegenteil behauptet.

Außerdem: Woran macht man das fest, dass die Scharfschützen die gleichen waren? Am Kaliber der Kugeln? Ich meine, wenn die Polizisten die einzigen sind, die am Anfang Waffen haben, dann ein Waffenlager von Demonstranten geplündert wird, dann ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit hoch, dass beide mit gleicher Munition schießen.

No, seriously. This kind of statement is as nebulous as saying ""Bush/Cheney should be tried at the Hague,"" etc. That is not to say that they do not have blood on their hands, but which statesman or politician doesn't?

Because the Bush administration, for all its faults, never armed people with the understanding that those people were going to engage in a mass killing spree. As in, the point of giving the Indonesian army firepower was so that they can kill a fuckton of East Timorese people. There is evidence that Kissinger knew exactly what the Indonesians were planning on doing with these weapons and was fine with it. 

As the purpose of the wars in Iraq/Afghanistan was something other than ""lets kill as many people from ethnic group x as possible"", you'd have a harder time saying the war as a whole was a war crime. The parts of the war that probably do constitute war crimes - prison torture and Blackwater killing random civilians - can be explained as rogue events, accidents, or someone else's fault in the way that arming the Indonesians can't. 

That's not to say that the aforementioned Iraq War incidents aren't war crimes or don't say something about the mindset of the Bush administration, even if they can claim that these things *technically* aren't their fault. It's just that their lame-ass ""not my fault"" defence is stronger than Kissenger's defense of what went down in East Timor.

true,zsmoki,EART,Earth,"&gt; Ukraine became an independent nation relatively recently - where were those who wanted to remain a part of Russia when that was happening?

From wiki:

&gt;Following a referendum on 20 January 1991, the Crimean Oblast was upgraded to that of an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on 12 February 1991 by the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR.[33]

&gt;With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Crimea became part of the newly independent Ukraine, which led to tensions between Russia and Ukraine.[nb 1] With the Black Sea Fleet based on the peninsula, worries of armed skirmishes were occasionally raised. Crimean Tatars began returning from exile and resettling in Crimea.

&gt;On 26 February 1992, the Verkhovniy Sovet (the Crimean parliament) renamed the ASSR the Republic of Crimea and proclaimed self-government on 5 May 1992[35][36] (which was yet to be approved by a referendum held 2 August 1992[37]) and passed the first Crimean constitution the same day.[37] On 6 May 1992 the same parliament inserted a new sentence into this constitution that declared that Crimea was part of Ukraine.[37]

&gt;On 19 May, Crimea agreed to remain part of Ukraine and annulled its proclamation of self-government but Crimean Communists forced the Ukrainian government to expand on the already extensive autonomous status of Crimea.[21]:587 In the same period, Russian president Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk agreed to divide the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet between Russia and the newly formed Ukrainian Navy.[38]

&gt;On 14 October 1993, the Crimean parliament established the post of President of Crimea and agreed on a quota of Crimean Tatars represented in the Council of 14. However, political turmoil continued. Amendments[clarification needed] to the constitution eased the conflict,[citation needed] but on 17 March 1995, the parliament of Ukraine intervened, scrapping the Crimean Constitution and removing Yuriy Meshkov (the President of Crimea) along with his office for his actions against the state and promoting integration with Russia.[39] After an interim constitution, the current constitution was put into effect, changing the territory's name to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea.

&gt;Following the ratification of the May 1997 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership on friendship and division of the Black Sea Fleet, international tensions slowly eased. However, in September 2008, the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Volodymyr Ohryzko accused Russia of giving out Russian passports to the population in the Crimea and described it as a ""real problem"" given Russia's declared policy of military intervention abroad to protect Russian citizens.[40]

&gt;On 24 August 2009, anti-Ukrainian demonstrations were held in Crimea by ethnic Russian residents. Sergei Tsekov (of the Russian Bloc[41] and then deputy speaker of the Crimean parliament[42]) said then that he hoped that Russia would treat the Crimea the same way as it had treated South Ossetia and Abkhazia.[43]",0,1394127095,null,0,false,0,cfvyrx2,t3_1zplqc,t1_cfvyrx2,t1_cfvvinj,null,1432685217,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

It was decided that these people who are not linguists by their job,  should get extra pay($100), if their commander says that having a bi/multi-lingual  person is an asset to his unit.  But you have to pass the language test for that language to prove your level of proficiency. So, I wanted to try and went to my commander and said I wanted to take the German test.  I had worked with the Bund. many times on ranges, and at a formal event I did the introductions between the German Army and the US Army, introducing Generals to each other. So, he supported it.

Now back then you were rated from 1-3, I think now it is 1-5 on listening and reading. You did the reading test in the morning, and the listening test in the afternoon.  The answers were multiple guess.  You never had to write or speak the language!

But before you tested; you had an interview.  They always asked, how did you learn the language? Now most grew up with it, or learned it in High School, or college. I shocked my interviewer by saying I picked up German by watching re-run of the Simpsons, and hanging out in bars! She laughed!

I explained that I had seen almost every episode of the Simpsons and knew what they were saying in English, and it was just a matter of hearing it differently. And that I had learned to get a German woman out of a bar and into my apartment, I had to speak a little German. She was at this point rolling laughing!  But, she allowed me to take the test.   
Oh and sometimes I take my landlord's news paper out of the recycle bin, so I know what is going on locally. She was almost hysterical! 

So at the end of the day of testing, you have to go in to see the same interviewer, to get your results in private. She was sitting there, and told me straight away she was shocked.  Everyone in the room gets a different version of the test, to prevent cheating. I got the Delta version which she said is the hardest. She told me that she has seen people from the State Department fail that test.  Between morning and afternoon I had only missed one question.

I walked out with a 3+/3+ ! For a few years I got an extra $100 on my check! Then they ended the program.

That may sound strange to some ears, but it makes a lot of sense once you dig deeper.

**Environment**
-----
* if the EU doesn't use the oil then China and Japan will. The oil is getting extracted whether we Europeans use it or not. Therefore, the CO2 will contribute to climate change whether we Europeans burn it or the Chinese/Japanese burn it.

* Russia is extremely lax with its environmental protection laws, some laws exist on the books but they are rarely enforced. As a result Siberia is being destroyed to feed Europe's appetite for energy. The US however, has environmental protection laws that vary in strictness from state to state; some states are as strict as our strictest others are a bit more lenient but all are subject to Federal ep laws, which are mediocre by German standards and stellar by Russian standards. And *most importantly* ep laws in the US are zealously enforced. There was a chemical spill in West Virginia a little bit back, and it was a top story throughout the country for weeks. This shows us that Americans overall care. So, using less Siberian oil will mean less catastrophic stress on Siberian wildlife.

* In addition to the regulations being better in the US, the technology is better too. I'm not saying its perfect, because that would be absurd, but it's far better. There is a pipeline Keystone-XL they are building and it has been the center of hot debate for many months. As a result of this debate, the builder has been forced to implement cutting-edge technology and even develop new technology. In Russia, they do not have such debates, they just build.

**Economy and Security
-----

* we depend on Ru for way too much of our energy supply. Gazprom and it's kin have proven time and time again that they will manipulate their customers whenever they deem necessary, which is often. 

* Russia has recently invaded a European nation and most of Europe is hesitant to intervene too much because we depend so much on Russian gas. German, French and UK troops could go into Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Crimea and oust the Russian soldiers there in a month. The Russian army is out-of-date while those other armies employ cutting-edge tech. Why not just get it over with? (the Ru soldiers would likely surrender anyway) Because hydrocarbons, that's why.

All of the above considered I would be willing to take a substantial hit on the state of Europe economically in the short term, even a 10% reduction in global trade. 

Getting back to that earlier point about it not damaging the EU's economy. It would not damage the EU's economy because it would not lead to a deterioration in the size of the EU economy but simply a lack of growth. The EU's main growth area is not made up of trade with Russia. The EU's recovery is due to restructuring at home, not by increasing global trade, apart from tangental growth in exports which is not important in the bigger picture.

En France c'est plutôt 2 enfants par femme.

The very concept of ""historical justice"" is a Western one, and a fairly recent one at that. In the old days when someone lost they were simply killed, or if a code of honor dictated that you spare them, put out to pasture or simply released—i.e. victor's justice. Nobody was ""tried for a war crime"" unless he did something particularly notorious that his head needed to roll to settle a blood debt or satisfy the public's outrage. Atrocities committed would be lost in the chaos of war—after all, there were few reliable ways of documenting them before the advent of recording devices—or regarded as a natural, albeit unfortunate, byproduct of armed conflict. Even after the idea of a war crime was codified (by way of international treaty, such as the Geneva and Hague conventions), it took the Holocaust *and then some* in order to actually lend credence to the idea.

So why do we prosecute war crimes? Well, of course, on a basic level we feel that justice need be done, but this justice is typically enforced by the winners upon the losers. In such circumstances, what hope is there for impartiality or due process? Isn't that a core tenet of our notion of justice? Hence we come full circle and it can easily be shown that our conception of justice is no different from the old. What *is* different, however, is the need to formally codify it in law and treaty. In a ""state of nature"" might makes right, but within our moral system we are compelled to act as if there is a higher idea to which we appeal. Thus it serves to legitimize our own authority, while at the same time rendering our opponents' illegitimate. 

This is what I mean when I say it is an extension of foreign policy. Of course it's inherently hypocritical, but that can't be helped.

Anyway, the point is it's meaningless to bring up the question of a tribunal because it won't happen. It's not politically useful to prosecute your own.

&gt;All of the above considered I would be willing to take a substantial hit on the state of Europe economically in the short term, even a 10% reduction in global trade.

Do you know what 10% global trade is, or is that a figure you've plucked out? The negative change in global GDP was -2.5% in 2009, the only time its declined since at least 2005.

&gt; It would not damage the EU's economy because it would not lead to a deterioration in the size of the EU economy but simply a lack of growth. 

Of course it would damage the economy. No energy means industrial production (for one) reduces significantly. That means job losses and the rest of it. What would be the goal of this? Crippling the Russian economy would kill their industrial production, meaning its not so easy for them to turn the gas back on once they've apologised. Some sort of political crisis in Russia means production in the EU still gets hit because their exports will decline substantially. So until that crisis is sorted (or until we magically find a new energy source overnight) we have to deal with less production, even more unemployment and an even worse economic outlook.

Wow, you blew my mind! Such prowess of argumentation! And if we don't burn all the coal we can get our hands on, someone else will and the pollution will happen anyway, and it's even cheaper than oil, so let's go for it!!111!!

&gt; Russia is extremely lax with its environmental protection laws, some laws exist on the books but they are rarely enforced. As a result Siberia is being destroyed to feed Europe's appetite for energy. The US however, has environmental protection laws that vary in strictness from state to state; some states are as strict as our strictest others are a bit more lenient but all are subject to Federal ep laws, which are mediocre by German standards and stellar by Russian standards. And most importantly ep laws in the US are zealously enforced. There was a chemical spill in West Virginia a little bit back, and it was a top story throughout the country for weeks. This shows us that Americans overall care. So, using less Siberian oil will mean less catastrophic stress on Siberian wildlife.
&gt; 

You're right we all know that the US is the beacon of environmental protection, that's why the biggest oil spills in history have all come from Russian companies!! ..oh...wait...

&gt; I'm addition to the regulations being better in the US, the technology is better too. I'm not saying its perfect, because that would be absurd, but it's far better. There is a pipeline Keystone-XL they are building and it has been the center of hot debate for many months. As a result of this debate, the builder has been forced to implement cutting technology and even develop new technology. In Russia, they do not have such debates, they just do.

Ah, they had a debate and now they're implementing cutting technology! What a relief!

&gt; Russia has recently invaded a European nation and most of Europe is hesitant to intervene too much because we depend so much on Russian gas. German, French and UK troops could go into Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Crimea and oust the Russian soldiers there in a month.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  in the US, the Tesla Model S outsold Mercedes, BMW, and Audi for similar models. 

So far, everybody who wants a long range electric car has to buy a Tesla, but that's still a niche market. Most people can't afford a car in this price range, and it's so expensive (and heavy) because it has a lot of batteries.

It was the best selling ""full-size luxury sedan"" in the US (more than the 7 series BMW, but less than the 5 series). They sold some 22,500 Model S world wide, about 18k of them in the US, less than the Chevy Volt or the Nissan Leaf. That's about 5% of BMW's US sales. World wide, BMW, Audi and Mercedes are at about 1.5 million units each (not counting Mini etc.).

&gt; The Model E target price is US$35,000.

Yes, the target price, for when exactly? Battery prices are coming down very, very quickly these days. It's well possible that they'll be able to pull it off in two or three years, but so will everybody else. Again, putting more batteries into a car is not something beyond the engineering capabilities of the established manufacturers.

Now the moral high ground is early 20th century war propaganda extended to our pro western culture.

It is hard to argue knowing the strategies implemented by americans during the cold war that they uphold any moral high ground.

Combine the might of the US with the propaganda of ""the war for democracy/capitalism/on drugs/on terorism"" and you have a world where not only does might make right but it tells you what to think about it afterwards.

Not directly. I think finally, and decisively removing Russia's last real bargaining chip will ruin their ability to dictate to its neighbours as it has done for centuries. It will still be a major playing in its regions, but it'll be a seriously diminished player which will enabled its satellites to improve.

&gt; Do you therefore also think our reaction to what is happening in Ukraine is identical to what it would be if they sent some troops into either of those 

No. Central Asia is an area of the World I want to see improvement in, but I think that we should be focusing on our own back yard for the simple reason that the resources we put in there will yield more fruit. Central Asia is a bonus by damages Russia's influence.

&gt;Do you know what 10% global trade is

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_the_European_Union

Russia makes up about ten percent of the EU's trade. 

&gt;The negative change in global GDP was -2.5% in 2009, the only time its declined since at least 2005.

Yes. That did happen. In 2009. Because of a global financial crisis. Not because of exports. 10% of exports does not equal anything like 10% of GDP. 

&gt;No energy means industrial production reduces significantly

Yes, however Russia isn't our only gas supplies. Norway exports more oil to the EU than Russia. We have alternative energy sources like nuclear, coal and various renewables. We can buy from other countries via tanker born travel from Arab states and North America as well as fracking at home. It'll hurt industrial production marginally and increase gas prices, but it's hardly crippling and the economy as a whole will continue to grow smoothly. 

&gt;What would be the goal of this? Crippling the Russian economy would kill their industrial production, meaning its not so easy for them to turn the gas back on once they've apologised

This problem is no where near as large as you make it out to be. All those facilities and oil pumps aren't going to disappear because of huge economic failings for just one year. It's not like we're actually dropping bombs on them. Maybe if we destroy their economy so badly that they start ripping down the oil refineries for the steel the refineries are made out of, but I doubt we even have the economic ability to do that.

The Russian economy will hopefully not be too badly crippled because they're cave before we do. This is brinkmanship, but I think even if the brinkmanship fails we will be able to quite steadily live with the consequences and we will achieve our goals but maybe over a few months rather than immediately. 

**In conclusion** I feel as though you've made this out to be much more damaging than it is. Yes it would have negative effects on the EU economy but there would be no huge loss of living standards or GDP. In fact I would argue that on average for the EU they would continue to increase at a more subdued rate. Gas prices would rise and there might be redundancies in some fields for a while but this will be rectified later when we have cheaper oil which will lead to more hardship. Sacrifices now lead to economic, humanitarian and political benefits down the road.

He dropped bombs in Cambodia, perhaps we should listen to an individual with more moral credentials right? Well, Kissinger was many things. Moral? Perhaps not. Pragmatic? Most certainly. Stop being so blinded by idealism and face the cold reality of the real world. Kissinger saw things as they are, and believed a balance of morality and a pursuit of national interests was the only way to have a successful foreign policy. Listen to his words, as they are just appropriate now as they were then:

&gt;Kissinger, famous for advocating an American foreign policy based on the national interest, has long stressed that values and power are properly understood as mutually supporting. As he argued in a 1973 speech, since “Americans have always held the view that America stood for something above and beyond its material achievements,” a “purely pragmatic policy” would confuse allies and eventually forfeit domestic support. Yet “when policy becomes excessively moralistic it may turn quixotic or dangerous,” giving way to “ineffectual posturing or adventuristic crusades.” The key to a sustainable foreign policy, in his view, is the avoidance of either extreme: **“A country that demands moral perfection of itself as a test of its foreign policy will achieve neither perfection nor security.”**

He is right, you cannot demand penultimate perfection of yourself and ever intend to have any consequential influence on the world stage. Words are nice, but sometimes guns have to come out to. That's reality, not fantasy. And look at the holier than thou pontificaters in this thread. Your ideas and suggestions are wonderful and all, but you are not in a position of power. If you were, your calculus would certainly change once you were dealing with the high stakes:

&gt;“The analyst runs no risk. If his conclusions prove wrong, he can write another treatise. The statesman is permitted only one guess; his mistakes are irretrievable.”-Kissinger

The truth is, he is correct in his assessment. And instead of realizing that, and discussing the implications of his suggestions, people here derail the conversation with useless talk about sending him to the gallows. Kissinger is smarter than you. He knows how the real world works. You don't. So anyway, should we talk about Ukraine, or waste our time digging up skeletons in Kissinger's past?

You gotta be fucking shitting me, I am drowning in chuckles now :P Ukraine is piss-poor, $3,800 GDP per capita. Russia is $14,600 GDP per capita.

Moreover, Ukraine is about to bite the IMF shitsandwhich whilst simultaneously losting out on the $16 billion promised by Russia (only $3 billion were handed over). They're gonna miss out on the free trade with Russia too. Fuck, I don't wanna be in their place, that country is heading down the shitter and the new gov't is just another set of corrupt oligarchs, not any different from the shit Ukraine had or the shit we have in Russia (at least we have a leader strong enough to somewhat rein them in).

Of course, there is one major factor here: political freedom. Kinda in short supply in Russia as of right now, to make an understatement. How much do the Crimeans value that? Hard to say, we are all former Soviet citizens, we are used to tough times in the 90s and we goddamn know how it's like to have shit nothing.

Il ne s'agit pas de traditionalistes religieux alors qu'il s'agit bien de gens normaux, pour qui la religion n'est ni bien ni mal, mais juste culturelle, et passe au second plan.

De plus, l'extrême-droite française n'a jamais eu une vision ethnique, [Maurras](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Maurras#Maurras_et_le_national-socialisme) était antiraciste, les sorties racistes sont plutôt le fait de la gauche (Jules Ferry en tête).

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Nope. Of all overseas territories of all EU members, only French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Reunion, Martinique (France), Azores, Madeira (Portugal), and the Canary islands (Spain) are in the EU.

The Falklands are a [British Overseas Territory.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Territories) They are not in the EU, as they are not constitutionally part of the UK. They do however have an MP that represents their interests, Hugo Swire MP.

Your objection also confuses me. You list a bunch of places that are in the EU, yet I said the UK was in the EEC (and EU also of course). They have also received occasional funding from the EU, as have numerous other Overseas Territories that are not in the EU. If its a matter of Britishness, I can assure you the difference is only legally. Culturally the Falklands are British. They made it pretty clear when all but 3 of them voted for it.

&gt;This was done using NATO procedures, even though the UK never made a formal request for help.

Yes. NATO procedures were used because that is the basis of British military relations with these nations. But their assistance was bilateral, not multilateral (i.e. through NATO). They're hardly going to make up a new way of communicating just because just because the UK decided not to request NATO assistance.

There's also the question of whether NATO could assist the UK in the Falklands. Being the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, there has since been questions raised over whether a war outside the North Atlantic region qualifies for NATO assistance. That the UK had no need for formal NATO assistance quashed that issue.",0,1394138867,null,0,false,0,cfw4gry,t3_1zpowe,t1_cfw4gry,t1_cfw42n0,null,1432687967,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

- *Boris* (miglior commedia italiana da qualche decennio)

- *Ghostbusters 2* (a molti piace di più il primo, io preferisco il seguito)

- *Terminator 2*

- tutti quelli di Kevin Smith, tranne *Chasing Amy*

- quasi tutti quelli di Bud Spencer &amp; Terence Hill

- le varie commedie italiane anni '70 - '80, tipo *Grand Hotel Excelsior*, *Grandi magazzini*, ecc.

Film sottovalutati o poco conosciuti e che consiglio:

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; First,even putin said that he doesn't want Crimea to join Russia,so thats not gonna happen.

I agree with you that Putin does not want to annex Crimea, as that's not the best outcome for Russia. But unfortunately it could happen even if it isn't his original goal nor the best outcome for anyone.

Putin said a lot of bullshit but on this point I believe him.

Russia annexing Crimea does not make sense. The region is fully dependend on energy, food and most importantly *water* from Ukraine. Its important economic activity is tourism. Good luck running a tourist resort without water, food, and electricity - never mind how to keep the 1.97 million inhabitants supplied. It would also have added political and ethnic instability, and in a way would be like importing Maidan to Russia.

Putin does not want annexed or even independend Crimea - both have huge risks of instability which is not what you want where your vital naval base is. Also upholding the Budapest Memorandum is in Russia's interests too - despite Russia having breached it on many occasions the territorial integrity of Ukraine would be best outcome also for them.

Crimea is the bargaining chip here. So what does Putin want? 

He wants to be in position where he can dictate terms to Ukraine regarding its western integration. He also wants something much more than bilateral - to be in a position where also the West has to accept his terms.

From his POV Ukraine simply cannot start western integration without his terms included from the beginning. All his previous efforts backfired. On its own volition Ukraine would not join Putins club of dictators in Customs Union, and with the Association Agreement Ukraine's path towards western integration would get started without Putin's terms in it. The whole project he had been running over a decade has crumbled (and probably his future Eurasian union plan).

And now all he has left is military invasion. Putin would rather have Crimea remaining as autonomous part of Ukraine. But only with his terms. And having invaded and occupied it he is in a better position to dictate his terms.

Eventually his demands might look something like this:  
0. Crimea stays as autonomous part of Ukraine, but with added locally established ethnic Russian military bodies

1. Russia's military bases remain in Crimea perhaps with new bases and additions such as the claimed bridge.

2. Ukraine agrees to stay militarily non-aligned and never to join NATO, perhaps with a guarantee from the West.

3. Ukraine and the West agree never to deploy certain types of military systems on the Ukrainian territory (such as certain types of missiles, radars and anti-missile defences).

4. Ukrainian defence forces are only allowed certain types and numbers of armament, and some types will be banned/restricted.

He wants Ukraine and the West to agree to them. For some terms a bilateral agreement with Ukraine may not be enough and he wants it multipartial. Then he would stop the military invasion and withdraw his occupying troops and sign Crimea back to Ukraine. His puppet PM in Crimea is a fully disposable clown, and referendum is just for posture.

But the problem is: All this could happen only with very good diplomacy and negotiation. And there's a big possibility for the West, Ukraine and Russia to fuck this up. Then Putin's plan B is to keep it - not what he originally wanted and not the best outcome for anyone.

When the chancellor of Austria planned a plebiscite to preserve Austria's independence, the German ministry of propaganda issued press reports that riots had broken out in Austria and that large parts of the Austrian population were calling for German troops to restore order.

Hitler had intended to Nazify Austria and make it a close ally to Germany, but after the invasion he decided to formally absorb the country as a German province.

No, the prosecution was a humanitarian showcase. 

Your ideology is irrelevant, each one has it's benefits and short falls in the case of modern superstates and international trade capitalism has more quantitive gains that can be taxed to support the state, while the people are self motivated to be productive by a mix of cultural nihilism and social ambition(the exact opposite of communism where ""cultural"" fulfilment and a lack of social ambition was encouraged).

 Further more if you look at ideologies on a purely social axis capitalism is more favored under fascist regimes than democracies, and in times of peace democracies tent to sway towards socialism because of humanist tendencies in the middle class. University educated people tend toward collective responsibility, it's a fact of existentialist life. The only argument for capitalism is that of economic freedom but in times of poverty that becomes even more limited than in a communist state sans the national safety net. The government cant feed it's crony satellites so embarks on riskier and riskier policies. Soon the only viable alternative is starting up the biggest job creator and social stimulant there is: war. If you don't have a important rival or just want to spend money indefinitely, without tangible objectives; you declare war on nouns: communism, drugs or terrorism. The issue is that if you are a austrian capitalist, you see the economic futility of this venture and you dread the day when a plutocratic, all powerful, government needs to tighten the belt and the mouths of its citizens.

I would like to point out that in it's current form, the US tends to veer very dangerously towards a plutocracy, as a fringe extremist faction managed, not only to shut down the government, but dictate the terms and issues of the whole country does politics. This coming from the party that defends individual freedom, because the abuse of security measures, the democrats passed trough would have been unacceptable for any western citizen before nixon but somehow acceptable during a non combative president.But it's not only the US, it's a rule, western countries are implementing security measures that would make SS oficers prematurely ejaculate. and in fact most of the tools of abuse arab dictators use to fight disidents are produced and tried in western countries first.

IMF is hardly a Savior either; a restructuring they gonna demand will hardly help (with outdated industry, aging demographics etc.) Should Ukraine try to pay all debts, while hypothetically rebuilding an economy.... we'll see another revolution within next 10 years.

Defaulting exclusively on Russian debts is unfair to Russia, but:

1. EU showed readiness to close eyes on injustice, when pain is inflicted upon non-member depositors (Cyprus and alleged Russian money laundering)

2. Russia cannot really let Ukraine go, even if it will mean to loose these $30 billions. As a silver lining, this Ukrainian lame duck parliament can at least do this default as a retribution for Crimea annexation.

I am not anti Russia, I just do not think that Ukraine can conceivably pay her debts, while restructuring economy, and opening markets to European industry (this is just fucking insane).

Should Ukraine default on ALL debts simultaneously, **than** the country will have a real problems. 

I guess in real life we might see annexation and then slow ~~defaulting~~ restructuring *a la* Greece.

Absolutely! In addition, the Russian speaking Eastern regions of the Ukraine are more industrialized and more prosperous than the Western regions. The industry is dependent on trade with Russia and would just collapse on the world market if the country had to open under pressure from the IMF and the EU.

**Culture**

The Uffizi and the Museo dell'Accademia are awesome and you should not miss them. Palazzo Vecchio and the churches (Santa Maria del Fiore, Santa Maria Novella, ...) .

**Food**

You could like going for an aperitivo. In many places is now a full fledged buffet with a drink at 8-10€. I'd suggest the Kitsch for the quantity of food or the Biblioteca delle Oblate for the view.

If you fancy a pizza, my favourite, altough more expensive than other places, is the pizzeria at the Osteria del caffé italiano. They only make three types of pizza, but those are great.

If you want to try the typical street food of Florence, it's called lampredotto and it's the boiled abomasum of the cow. I personally love it with just salt and black pepper, but green sauce and chili pepper are allowed.

Also, Via de' neri is a good place to have something to eat: the Antico vinaio and the Prosciutteria are good places for a sandwich and on the same road there is a good ice cream place. Also, avoid the places where the the ice cream looks like a mountain.

**Drink**

A bottle of wine at ~5€ at a supermarket is a good enough wine. You may be lucky and find something better for less money at a specialised shop. Is you are going out to drink, Florence is full of small places, but the areas for night life are Santa Croce and Santo Spirito. I don't know how it works with Norwegian school trips, but on mine it was quite common to have a drink or two (or ten at night in one of the rooms)

**Dance**

It's been too long ago I've been to a nice place to dance in Florence, on the rare occasions I go dancing around the centre it's usually at the Twice because the entrance is free.

**Random**

Dreoni. They sell toys and models but I love the place (I go in, take a look of the place and never buy anything).

**Nearby**

However, this does not change the fact that Crimeans do have a right to self-determination. They are an established political region with a specific character as a unified ""people"", and as such they are in the right to want a free and fair referendum for their future as part of Ukraine or Russia.

This is what I think Ukraine should do; make a deal with Russia. Ukraine guarantees the future of the existing Russian military bases in Crimea for the next 100 years, as well as the protection of ethnic Russians in Crimea. 

A referendum should also be held in Crimea that states ""Should Crimea be a part of the Russian Federation?"". This should be organised by the central Ukrainian government. Both parties will agree to respect the result.

true,supterfuge,null,null,"&gt;Il ne s'agit pas de traditionalistes religieux alors qu'il s'agit bien de gens normaux, pour qui la religion n'est ni bien ni mal, mais juste culturelle, et passe au second plan.

Il s'agit de gens pour lesquels la culture religieuse précède la culture civique, des gens pour qui la religion est plus fondatrice que le bien commun. Civitas et leurs équivalents musulmans sont à mettre sur le même plan : fondamentalement, des anti-républicains.
On peut étendre la description plus largement qu'aux simples ""traditionnalistes"" (et je ne parlais pas des fondamentalistes). Dire simplement que ce sont des pratiquants ""et rien de plus"", mais ça ne change pas la réponse.
La religion n'a plus à être aux fondements de la citoyenneté depuis 1901.

&gt;De plus, l'extrême-droite française n'a jamais eu une vision ethnique, Maurras était antiraciste, les sorties racistes sont plutôt le fait de la gauche (Jules Ferry en tête).

""L'extrême-droite française n'a jamais eu une vision ethnique ?"". Je ne vais pas m'attarder sur Maurras, que je ne connais pas, mais lui-même cite Gobineau. Gobineau avec son *Traité sur l'inégalité des races* est aux fondements de l'anthropologie racialiste et des prétentions scientifiques du racisme, pour légitimer le pouvoir des aristocrates et la défense de la société de l'ancien régime (avec ce qu'on sait d'antirépublicanisme). Maurras n'est pas la définition de l'extrême-droite : l'ensemble des courants qui ont hérité, découlé des courants légitimistes sont l'extrême droite. Si on voulait être totalement honnête, il n'y a pas d'extrême droite, d'extrême gauche, ou plus simplement de gauche ou de droite. Il y a un ensemble de courants qui se recoupent, s'entremêlent, parfois s'oppose avant que quelqu'un ne vienne en faire une synthèse, etc. Il y a le légitimisme, le nationalisme, l'anarcholibéralisme, l'humanisme (au sens d'humanisme classique chrétien), le communisme, l'autoritarisme, l'antiautoritarisme, etc, etc. Mais au final, le courant poujadiste dont est héritière Marine Le Pen (je n'ai pas dit qu'elle en était une représentante, attention) est lui-même l'héritier de cette culture nationaliste anti-républicaine.

&gt;Hahaha, oui, le classique ""l'extrême-droite ils sont bêtes"". Snobisme de la gauche qui n'a pas compris ce que c'était que d'être pauvre parfaitement illustré par Guilluy ici.

Ce n'est pas exclusif à la gauche que d'être snob. La droite est identique. Il suffit de voir le discours de la droite quand il s'agit d'économie, presque paternisant vis à vis de la gauche. Façon ""Mais vous ne savez pas ce que vous dites"". On n'a pas d'idées politiques si on ne croit pas avoir raison, et on n'en vient pas à les défendre, à participer à un débat, si on ne pense pas que l'autre à tord. 
Ca ne veut pas dire que l'on n'apprend rien, que l'on n'emploie rien de ce que l'autre nous apporte. D'une précédente discussion avec toi, j'ai approfondi mon savoir sur le rôle des patrons comme semeurs de misère, et ça a renforcé mes convictions. Ce n'est pas par ce que tu ne me convaincs pas de A à Z que je suis snob.
De plus, la majorité des universitaires en science humaines (économie mise à part) sont ""de gauche"". Boniface, Foucault, Derrida, Bourdieu, Garrigou, Lacroix, Gros, Offerlé, et bien d'autres. Oui, il y en a de droite ; la majorité des universités françaises ont, à l'heure actuelle, des pôles de sciences humaines situés à gauche (bien que presque jamais partisans). Est-ce si étonnant si ceux qui ont la culture, le recul, ont étudié, ont procédé à des enquêtes de terrains, à des observations scientifiques, sont de gauche ? On sait que le FN nous tient en permanence (et c'est ce qui le relie à l'anti-intellectualisme de l'extrême droite parfaitement décrit par Arendt) un discours anti-intellectualiste. C'est pour une raison simple : il n'y a pas d'intellectuel d'extrême-droite qui ai eu un véritable impact sur la pensée politique depuis Maurras (et allez, soyons sympathique et accordons le : Sorel).

De la même façon, les économistes sont principalement libéraux. 

&gt;Et j'ajouterai même que c'est du racisme.

Et tu auras tord. Je suis d'accord avec le tout début de son intervention. Mais c'est le discours des socialo, et d'une partie de la gauche républicaine.
Indice : je ne suis pas républicain (Ou disons que je suis partagé entre deux visions qui me semblent également bonnes si accomplies, bien que possédant toutes les deux des défauts auxquels je n'arrive pas à adresser de réponse satisfaisante : le républicanisme socialisant décrit par quelqu'un comme Mélenchon, et une forme anarcho-syndicaliste de l'organisation sociale). En revanche, il est légitime de parler de la représentation des dominés, et de la nécessité de représenter ceux qui sont issus d'un ensemble de parcours : issus des anciennes colonies, réfugiés, immigrés économiques post-50/60s, immigrés communautaires, etc. En gros, l'ensemble de ceux qui composent notre société à l'heure actuelle qui y participent autant que les ""français de souche"" dont Soral défend le rôle fondateur. 

Et puis, son passage zémourien sur le rap, pitié quoi. Ce mec multiplie les amalgames quand il essaye de les dénoncer : sur la vision unique qu'aurait la gauche d'abord, sur le rap maintenant ? Entre [Rocé](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO3JkL5NVcU), [La Canaille](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ60dhzq-SU), [Casey](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7w3qapovuk), [La Rumeur](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzbF5G76hNA), j'trouve ça assez dramatique que votre intellectuel de référence en arrive à être autant stigmatisant.

@2:00, sa sortie sur le djembé, c'est absolument pathétique. C'est raciste que de ne pas s'en tenir qu'à sa culture d'accueil, mais aussi de s'intéresser à la culture de ses ancêtres ? Quand Weather Report utilise un Djembé dans ses compositions (et joué par un blanc, pour le coup), c'est quoi ? L'expérimentation musicale, c'est forcément illégitime si c'est un noir qui joue du djembé ?

&gt;C'est toujours drôle de voir la gueule des gens de gôche quand ils se font calmer par un Soralien cultivé.
En effet, l'individu dit « de gauche » est souvent dogmatique, inquisiteur, estime avoir plus raison que les autres, être systématiquement du côté du bien. Bref, en se sentant de gauche on se sent en droit d'apprendre la vie aux autres gens.

Un soralien cultivé, ça n'existe pas. Je vais citer la critique qu'un ami a écrit du bouquin-débat entre Naulleau et Soral :

« A la base, Naulleau prétend vouloir démonter Soral. En admettant qu'il soit honnête - ce que je pense - le livre me semble prouver que le dialogue n'est pas possible : jamais Soral et Naulleau ne discutent. Chacun parle de ce qui l'intéresse (la littérature et le sociétal pour Naulleau, les banquiers juifs pour Soral) et monologue dans son coin. A chaque fois, trois lignes laissent entendre qu'ils vont se répondre et en fait non, chacun étant une bille sur le terrain ou l'autre compte l'amener (dans le cas de Soral c'est même une bille tout court) ne fait que rester dans son petit pré-carré à espérer que le lecteur lui donne raison. Notons quand même que les quelques efforts viennent de Naulleau qui en sort grandi si on est adepte du débat démocratique - et passe pour une fiote selon les critères soraliens pour qui le monologue d'autosuçage représente la réussite absolue.

Reste que ça me fait bien rigoler de voir Soral dire "" Non, la littérature c'est pas mon truc je préfère l'économie "" quand Naulleau lui en parle pour ne pas se gêner à enchaîner les saillies débiles sur Albert Cohen ou George Sand sur son site ; on sent que le discours soralien ne peut fonctionner que devant un public inculte et que lui-même en a très bien conscience. »

On notera la stupidité du concept de bien-pensance que tu ne m'as pas sorti aujourd'hui, mais duquel tu es friand d'une manière générale. La pensée unique, ça n'existe pas, et l'image que vous en donnez est particulièrement différente du discours dominant produit à l'intention des dominés.

Live in the States, attend a Uni here. Born and lived in Chernivtsi (West). My parents are more or less split, father doesn't care either way as long as there is enough support for it in Crimea and my mother however disagrees with it on nationalist grounds. 

I study history myself, I have always been fascinated with it. I see the Crimean takeover as something that is unsurprising given Putin's ambitions and the broken promises of the US not to induct any former Warsaw Pact/USSR nations into NATO (given at the time of the dissolution of the USSR). Ukraine is a manufactured state historically, most of its identity is owed to WWI&amp;WWII German efforts to split up Russia/USSR by organising nationalism in Ukraine. It has never been independent, the Cossacks were mostly Russian-descendant and the Kievan Rus had its successor in the Novgorod states. The Mongols split us up, the Eastern Slavs. However, the slight regional differences did not amount to independent nation-states or national movements until the 20th century. 

I am surprised to see talk of annexation however, I figured Putin would give it the Abkhazia/South Ossetia treatment. That would have been easier to swallow for the international community.

Ukraine is in a dark place now, the new government is backed by oligarchs and none of my family our friends expect it to be much different. The country is bankrupt, the IMF is circling overhead -- they will provide help, but by many indicators, this may be worse than Greece. Good Heavens forbid Putin tries to interrupt trade, that will completely sink Ukraine (but also hurt Russia at a time when we aren't at our best). There is no profit now in being a Ukrainian citizen, I wouldn't be surprised if the East starts eyeing union with Russia in a year or two as Ukraine is ravaged by the strict (though necessary) IMF bailout terms. Freedom is empty philosophy when you've lost your job and your family is going hungry. At least the unfree Russia promises much better economic prospects.

In short-term, Ukrainian people should have accepted the $16bn debt buyout, the 1/3 cheaper gas price and free trade with Russia. That would have left the country in a much better economic shape. Next term, vote the criminal idiot Yanukovich out and hopefully elect a better leader. Play with Russia but have EU in the sights, tackling corruption, et al. A smart leader would take all the aid Russia offered without planning to stay with Russia forever.

* Consider asset freezes and travel bans if there is not further diplomatic progress

The third point, in particular ""if Russia makes further incursions in Ukraine"" might suggest that Crimea will become part of Russia. Or rather, that the EU isn't going to be doing anything more than what has already been said.

EU action on this is based on member state willingness. The Commission can't just up and say ""we embargo Russia"" or anything like that, because they have don't have the power, authority, or means of enforcement. Similarly, the Parliament can unanimously vote to do whatever they want, but they too lack the means to go through with it.

For a bar with a good atmosphere and live music, go to Los Pelicanos, they also hold intercambios every week and attract a lot of people.

Remember the 28 perspectives are far from homogenous. The UK (City of London), France (military deal), Germany (energy/industry) and Poland/ex-Soviet states (history) all have very different perspectives coming into this. Sure they all want a peaceful resolution and all seemingly side with Ukraine, but as for how to deal with Russia, these different perspectives are what numbs the EU.

Financial sanctions hurt the British in the City, trade sanctions hurt the French military deals and energy (also trade) sanctions hurt the Germans. So there's bound to be a bit of self-interest when deciding exactly what to do.

&gt; Possibly I'm more annoyed that the UK has not acted stronger on its own.

That's fair enough because we could do something. But our impact on Russia would be nothing more than symbolic and would hurt us more. We can only 'punish' them with something we currently deal in with Russia, so it has to be finance based. If we take away the City they'll just go to Paris, Geneva or Frankfurt.
