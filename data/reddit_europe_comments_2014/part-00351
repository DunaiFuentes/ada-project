Also a specific occasional-applied right of changing is only possible if the requirements and results are determined or determinable objectively. This is relevant in two different ways: If §13 paragraph 2 was to depict a genuine right of changing the purpose, then it would have to refer to §12 paragraph 1 as requirement to be (possibly) able to be valid. But with that said, a kind of „electoral alternative“ to the stipulated expiring would be created which would put the precise conveyance and occurence of that clause. Also, as shown above (compare B.I.2.) not only the requirements but also the consequences, that is to say the manner  of the conversion, would have to be objectively determinable for an effective changing of the purpose. Once the new purpose is entirely accessible (public charity / charitable act), this requirement would therefore also be missing. However it is to assume altogether that the founder wanted to make arrangements that are valid, and thus in doubt of such a case, interpretation that ensures the effectiveness of the charity is to be preferred (favor negotii).""

Damit sollte eigentlich klar sein das der Typ von Irina ein PUA ist. Vielleicht hilft es auch wenn man diesen Teil nicht als Sammlung harter Fakten betrachtet sondern als illustrative Anekdote um den Leser ein Beispiel zu geben wie sich so ein stereotypischer PUA verhält, schließlich ist dies ein recht neues Phänomen.

Diese Journalistin hat sich aber anscheinen mehr Mühe gegeben als /u/cheio , denn diese Soziologin hat zu dem Zeitpunkt des Erscheinens des Artikels nicht nur eine Masterarbeit zu PUAs geschrieben, sondern arbeitete bis dieses Jahr noch an einer Doktorarbeit zum gleichen Thema. Man kann also davon ausgehen das sie damit eine Expertin auf dem Gebiet ist. Zudem wundert mich der Vorwurf die Aussagen seien ungeprüft, die Autorin hat sich schließlich auch noch mit einem Psychologen über das Thema unterhalten, während die Aussagen des Herrn Pütz (warum kein Anführungszeichen?) nicht durch eigene Wissenschaftliche Arbeiten untermauert sind. Wie sollte denn so eine Überprüfung im Artikel dargestellt werden? Wenn die Aussagen von Frau Thöne so stimmen muß man das doch nicht extra betonen, zudem werden ihre Aussagen als korrekt Zitate dargestellt.

Meiner Meinung nach wird ""Der PUA"" hier nicht als unmenschlich dargestellt, sondern als manipulativ und simpel, was seine Anmachstrategien angeht. Die Gründe für dieses Verhalten sind ganz menschlich wie der im Artikel zitiert Psychologe Baranowski darstellt ""Viele hätten aber auch gar nichts Böses im Sinn, sondern suchten ganz arglos nach Hilfe, ihre Schüchternheit zu überwinden und ihre sozialen Fähigkeiten zu verbessern."". Das ist vielleicht nicht schön, aber immernoch menschlich, denn Schwächen gehören dazu.

Most people are not really against water charges, in most places we have the pipes the British laid down in service. Shit needs upgrading big time and conversation of water won't happen with wishy washy thinking. Paying for rubbish collection by weight and plastic bag levies have done wonders for recycling in Ireland. A properly run water charging system should achieve the same.

The real problem is the body set up to administer the metering and collection (Irish Water, semi-state body) has been inept, over-spending, over-paying staff and stuffed with cronies. Furthermore, we all know it's only being set up to be privatised a few years later. FUCK THAT. The government signed something lately to say it guaranteed to never be private ^until ^2019 in order to placate protestors so that's only confirmed suspicions.

The only solution is to call a referendum to insert a clause into the Constitution guaranteeing public ownership of Irish Water. A state bill is too easy to change.

Also, this has been the first protest in a long time to gather so much support across the board, previous protests were dismissed as life dolers who can fuck off.

On the other hand, I don't think anyone should have the right to legally demand other people to change their thoughts, or even make them public. In a society, there will be ideological and cultural groups with different amounts of people who identify with them, and I am against the idea that just because yours has more people in it, you have the right to demand to others that they stop believing in whatever they believe (immigrants or not).

As for your example: I believe France, as a social collective, has the right to define common laws regulating which actions are okay and which ones are not. If immigrants follow those laws, then they have assimilated in French society as much as it can be demanded of them. The same way that nobody can demand you to act or think in a certain way you are not legally obligated, just because you are in a minority in that regard.

Don't forget that people in minority groups are in most cases native to the country, and the culture of a country is not just that of the dominant group, but the aggregate of every individual's personal beliefs, personalities and attitudes.

This historiography line starts with the 1898 disaster and the reformulation of Spain as a modern nation alone (Peninsula). And it was after 1898 that a modern nationalistic (Castilian) view of Spain emerges. This new state nationalism had to fight with peripheral nationalism and also with the Republican and K.C.F Krause thesis that set the nation based on the geography and a true love to the country opposed to the militaristic and church guided conservative nationalism.

corruption is an inevitable risk of the political process sadly. Those who seek political power are the ones who can subvert it for personal gain and it seems almost as the ones most likely to be corrupt.

Corruption is a personal issue - and a crime. It should not be turned into a political battleground between parties with different ideologies - all parties are vulnerable to it. All corrupt individuals should be fairly investigated and prosecuted. Party institutions should NOT protect corruption, but let´s focus on corruption as a thing individuals do and choose to do.  I think controlling corruption can only work through investigating the actions of each and every individual - even for those which are not corrupt but just let things slide, the threat of investigation for corruption should be upon everybody with a public and political position. (heck it is on every private individual as well)

Lo stage, o tiricinio, non è un contratto di lavoro subordinato. Distinzione importante, perché significa che uno stage non dà di per sé diritto a una retribuzione minima, né ai contributi pensionistici, ferie, maternità, congedi, indennità di malattia né alcun tipo di preavviso per la sua terminazione.

Vedi quindi quanto sia indecente la pratica, purtroppo diffusissima, di ""assumere in stage"": l'ossimoro nasconde appunto la natura illecita e sfruttatrici di questo rapporto di lavoro concluso tramite un instituto di formazione che elimina ogni tipo di diritto per il lavoratore.

La pratica, per altro, non ha appunto alcuna scusante accettabile perché la necessità di prova è ampiamente coperta dal periodo di prova che si può applicare a qualunque contratto di lavoro a tempo indeterminato (che, anche in periodo di prova, garantisce tutte le normali tutele tranne quella dal licenziamento).

Tu imperterrito continui a parlare di morti, di soldi per bonificare le scuole, come se io fossi d'accordo con l'assoluzione o approvassi le morti o volessi negare i risarcimenti alle famiglie. Non è così, semplicemente sono due cose diverse.

Una cosa è dire se è giusto che quel tizio paghi per quello che ha fatto e la risposta ovviamente è sì, visto che la colpevolezza è stata accertata.

Ma le sentenze non hanno lo scopo di fare giustizia, bensì di accertare se un imputato è colpevole del capo di imputazione che gli viene contestato. E secondo me per un capo di imputazione che prevede una pena fino a 10 anni è giusta la prescrizione perchè per un reato di quel tipo l'imputato ha diritto a venire processato in meno di 30 anni. Ora magari ti sembrerà una cosa assurda perchè hai negli occhi il processo eternit (processo che si sarebbe concluso con una veloce condanna se il PM avesse optato per omicidio). Ma una legge deve valutare tutti i casi, non un caso particolare, e venire processati a distanza di 30 anni per un reato con pena di pochi anni è incivile.

Ti faccio un esempio che faceva la mia vecchia azienda. A giugno scadevano i permessi dell'anno prima, quindi dovrebbero pagarli (poco, ma comunque devono pagarli), ma col superminimo assorbibile possono far scendere i soldi da una parte e mantenere il lordo uguale. Praticamente ti pagano sì i permessi ma ti tolgono lo stipendio per mantenere il lordo uguale (cosa che coi livelli non possono fare essere il livello non assorbibile, quindi in quel caso ti aumenterebbe veramente lo stipendio lordo, e quindi anche il netto). La cosa vale per molte voci della busta paga, pure il premio di produzione credo (ma qui non sono sicuro, chiedo l'aiuto del pubblico).

I must have been not clear enough then, as people apparantly seem to have interpreted this as a call for *Gesundes Volksempfinden'. Which it of course is not. I directly myself to you, /u/GeeJo, and /u/visvis.

Ignoring the fact that the court indeed could reasonably come to this conclusion legally, I will repeat what I said before: judges need popular backing for their verdicts, as a lack of trust in the state of law will lead to some very unwarranted situations. That means that judges should *consider extensively* the feelings that live in society in weigh those into their verdict. 

Of course to cut to the chase: this all hinges on evidence and the opinion of the court. As a law student myself, I understand that any court is bound by constraints set forward in jurisprudence. What I however reject, and will always keep on rejecting, is that a judge should mechanically apply former jurisprudence to such an extent that it leads to anger in society. To Geejo I say: no 'mob rule', but simply ensuring that the justice system can fall back on the backing of society. The court could have come to the same verdict in my opinion, if it would have more extensively weighed the evidence in contrast to what really happened. The court in my eyes did not do that enough.

Jclad, I consider it far from morally (and legally) sound that someone that is culpable to the deaths of 3 people, one of them being a young child, should get away with a slap on the wrist. The simply fact that apparantly so many Redditors get into 'correct' mode and disagree with me for simply **stating the obvious** shows me for the first time that r/europe indeed is clinging very much to leftist ideas. Which is fine by me, but it does not lead to any decent argument apparantly. 

It goes without saying that any case demands the careful weighing of evidence, to come to the conclusion whether this verdict was correct or if another decision should have been taken. The 'aanmerkelijke kans' criterium plays an important role in this situation, which (with respect to /r/geejo) would loosely translated mean something as the 'risk taken'. This criterium defines whether another section of the law should have been applied, or not. Speeding could of course by a practical example while filling in this criterium, but there are other possibilities out there.

It is clear that apparantly the evidence is not sufficient, because of the long standing dogma that seems to be developing in criminal law all over the world: witnesses are simply not capable of correctly remembering what they saw. 

This is what stings me the most from this verdict, and that's why I uphold my earlier comment that I consider it (terribly) flawed. In just a few lines witness testimonies were simply discarded because there was no other evidence to state exactly what they had seen. This legal line in the sand is one step too far for me: apparantly the court expects that there should be something close to a radar detection device in order for it to actually start believing witness testimonies. Cynical comment, but not out of this world. 

The court then goes on (also related to the testimonies) to weigh in expert opinion, but in the end it turns out that experts have not managed to prove or disprove speeding. As a result of this inability for experts to conclude what really happened and the ambiguity of their research,  the court considers the witness testimonies to be unsound as they cannot alone serve as evidence.

This decision completely depends on the opinion of the judge. In the [verdict](http://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBLIM:2014:10041) I can find no trace of questions asked to  the accused, nor do I concur with the assumption that the court has thoroughly motivated its decision. Too much remains uncertain in order for the court to have reasonably come to this decision. I hope that appeal will overturn this travesty of justice.

&gt;__Smart Automobile__  is a division of [Daimler AG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daimler_AG) that manufactures and markets the [Smart Fortwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Fortwo). Headquartered in [Böblingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B6blingen), Germany, Smart has marketed a range of vehicles and has its primary assembly plant in [Hambach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hambach,_Moselle), France. [Annette Winkler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Winkler) has served as Smart's CEO since 2010.

&gt;Smart uses a lowercase [logotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotype) in its branding and a logo incorporating the letter ""c"" for ""compact"" and an arrow for ""forward thinking"".

&gt;The design concept for Smart's automobiles began in the late 1980s, associated with [Swatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch). After a period of backing by [Volkswagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen), the first model was finally launched by [Daimler-Benz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daimler-Benz) in October 1998. Several variants on the original design have been introduced, with the original design, called the *[Fortwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Fortwo)*, now in its second generation and available as an [electric version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_electric_drive).

false,Parabellum8g,NETH,Indifference is the best kind of tolerance (/s),"Law student myself here. I disagree with the verdict of the court, although on other reasons. 

The court should consider extensively the feelings that live in society in weigh those into their verdict when it comes down to motivating whether evidence is admitted or allowed to serve as a basis for conviction.

Of course to cut to the chase: this all hinges on evidence and the opinion of the court. As a law student myself, I understand that any court is bound by constraints set forward in jurisprudence. What I however reject, and will always keep on rejecting, is that a judge should mechanically apply former jurisprudence to such an extent that it leads to anger in society. 

Let the following be clear about my opinion: the court could have come to the *same* verdict in my opinion, if it would have more extensively weighed the evidence in contrast to what really happened. The court in my eyes did not do that enough.

The 'aanmerkelijke kans' criterium plays an important role in this situation, which would loosely translated mean something as the 'risk taken'. I believe you already stipulated it under 'culpa', c.q. culpable carelessness. This criterium defines whether another section of the law should have been applied, or not. Speeding could of course be a practical example while filling in this criterium, but there are other possibilities out there.

It is clear that apparantly the evidence is not sufficient, because of the long standing dogma that seems to be developing in criminal law all over the world: witnesses are simply not capable of correctly remembering what they saw.

This is what stings me the most from this verdict, and that's why I consider this verdict flawed. In just a few lines witness testimonies were simply discarded because there was no other evidence to state exactly what they had seen. This legal line in the sand is one step too far for me: apparantly the court expects that there should be something close to a radar detection device in order for it to actually start believing witness testimonies. Cynical comment, but it basically comes close to the threshold put forward by the court to accept witness testimonies.

The court then goes on (also related to the former paragraph) to weigh in expert opinion, but in the end it turns out that experts have not managed to prove or disprove speeding. As a result of this inability for experts to conclude what really happened and the ambiguity of their research, the court considers the witness testimonies to be unsound as they cannot alone serve as evidence.

This decision completely depends on the opinion of the court. In the [verdict](http://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBLIM:2014:10041) I can find no trace of questions asked to the accused, nor do I concur with the assumption that the court has thoroughly motivated its decision regarding why the witness testimonies were *not* sufficient evidence. If the court in question would have used more than about 10 lines to discard witness testimonies, then it might have properly motivated its verdict. 

I am positive that if the Gerechtshof (next higher court) upholds this verdict in exactly the same manner, it will fail when brought before the Hoge Raad (the High Court).

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Jclad, I consider it far from morally (and legally) sound that someone that is culpable to the deaths of 3 people, one of them being a young child, should get away with a slap on the wrist. 

It depends. He was (by my knowledge) not planning to kill these people, he didn't take any risk of seriously injuring others by consuming alcohol or drugs, and by reckless driving remains a unanswered question.

Assuming that he drove around the speed limit and as the court mentioned wasn't using a cell Phone (so by knowledge of the court not consiously bringing others in dangers) this seems like a terrible, terrible *accident*. 

That, considering all things brought forward, can be probably not be blamed on the person bringing himself and others in danger. My opinion is **we do not lock people up because they make an unforseen mistake/accident, at which their consious behaviour did not atribute to**.

If he was indeed speeding way too hard (+/-100+ km/h) on drugs, alcohol, using it's Phone, driving a flawed vehicle etc. this would be an entirely different discussion. 

So as to your opinion that we should lock him up so others would feel better, I disagree. You have the right to an opinion just as I do, but that is not justice in my view.

As to your point regarding the witnesses and how serious they are taken, I agree. But I will withhold my further comment on that as I didn't read the witness statements.

I'm German and study computer science in uni and Japanese just for fun.

I'd personally go for German. There are multiple reasons for that.

For once, your English is good enough that I feel comfortable to say that English will help you with German. That makes it A LOT easier than Japanese.

Japanese is **NOT** a hard language. No language is hard. It just takes a fucking long time to learn the characters. That's what all those fancy charts mean with ""difficulty"". The characters and the very foreign vocabulary is what will kill you. It takes a very long time to learn all that. And you'll feel ""too stupid to say anything meaningful for a very long time"". The grammar is very straight forward.

Now, that's not *really* a problem if your goal is to learn Japanese. Just tough it up and pull through. But I also wanted to learn Norwegian and French. So I was in a very similar situation you're in right now. It took me a year to get my shit together and not switch between languages constantly. I always thought ""oh, Norwegian is easy, I can learn Japanese later"" and then I was like ""god Norwegian is so useless. Can't do shit with it outside of Norway. Let's learn French!"" and then I was like ""French is so boring... Let's go back to Japanese!"" and then I was like ""Oh my gawd it takes such a long time to learn ANYTHING with this language. Let's go back to the easy Norwegian"" and that went on and on and on and on until I gave my mother everything I own in terms of language learning except my Japanese text books and told her to hide it and never give it back to me until I can read a novel in Japanese. That didn't work because that's what my grandfather did when he tried to stop smoking and then he got angry so as soon as I asked her where the books are, she gave up and handed them to me... 

A few months ago I managed to stick to Japanese. 

So, Japanese is harder than German for you (assuming that you're not already fluent in reading the characters) but why German then? Well, for once because it's easier for you. But Germany seems to be a nice country for software engineers. And if you want to, you can read stuff about programming and and stuff in German. I'm sure there are some blogs, books and other websites I just completely switched to English stuff so I don't remember... It's very easy to get any kind of media in German because we western countries work similarly on terms of digital distribution where Japan is still hanging on to CDs and stuff. Also, importing is dirt cheap (if you're living in a country with it's own amazon store, you can just order from amazon.de. amazon.co.jp is blocked for addresses outside of Japan, I think).

So, I'd personally suggest German but go for whatever you feel more interested in. But keep in mind that you might be struggling to keep yourself motivated if there's an ""easier option"".

false,MauvaisConseil,YAFrance,France,"&gt; Un modèle de financement du revenu universel ça m'intéresse pas mal aussi mais j'ai du mal à voir comment on peut faire un modèle de ce truc là sans mettre dans les hypothèses de départ. Tu partais de quoi ?

Dans la dernière version, espérance de vie à 85 ans, 15% de chômage, début de carrière à 23 ans et fin à 67 ans. Pyramide des âges en tronc (renouvellement pur des générations toutes de même taille), chômage plus élevé les 5 premières et 5 dernières années. 

Après le revenu est réservé aux adultes (option de distinction français / européen / autres), on supprime RSA et autres aides non médicales, on baisse le smic d'autant que le revenu universel. Les citoyens peuvent voter pour le montant des cotisations et donc du revenu (option pour distinguer français et autres). J'ai un système d'impôts individualisé à 2 tranches : une supérieure pour les 1% les plus riches qui doivent contribuer à 10% des recettes. Évidemment il est très facile d'ajouter des tranches : dans une version précédente les 10% contribuent à 20% des recettes (x2), les 1% à 5%des recettes (x5), et les 0,1% à 1% des recettes (x10). 

Pour empêcher l'accumulation de capital, l'impôt sur les successions est défini de la manière suivante : si pas d'enfants, 90% d'impôt ; si 1 enfant, 66% d'impôt (division du capital par 3 en une génération) ; si 2 enfants , 50% d'impôts (division par 4 du capital) etc. 

Il me restait à faire au moins une refonte de la tva et des charges patronales : les employeurs (charges patronales) ne paient ""plus"" que pour le financement des infrastructures de santé transport, dans l'idéal les banques (le secteur financier) financent l'armée et la police par un impôt spécial ""parasite"" et la tva finance l'investissement (en particulier l'éducation). Il faut que je cale la justice à un endroit logique, je n'ai pas encore choisi. 

Ensuite, rendre ça dynamique et prévoir une période de montée en puissance. L'avantage, c'est que c'est un modèle adapté à la croissance zéro. Évidemment, on peut prendre ou garder certaines parties du modèle en fonction de ce qu'on aime.

Désolé je suis sur mobile donc la mise en forme est dégueulasse.

Even is the eyewitness accounts had been accepted, the forensics show that the accident cannot have been entirely due to his speed. Even at the maximum possible speed the car could have been controlled properly.

The average of the bounds on the confidence interval for the speed is 100 km/h. It isn't proven that he even drove this but even if we do assume that, this is not reckless on a 80 km/h road. A large fraction of the people would drive this speed on such a road. In fact, if a police surveillance car had measured this speed they probably wouldn't even have stopped him (20 km/h over is generally the threshold for this). 

That said, I believe the judge was also right to discard the testimonies about the speed. People are simply incapable of estimating how fast a car is driving. Hence it hs no value however certain the witnesses feel they are. In addition, the fact that they saw an accident happen also biases their judgment.

I think it is good to consider what kind of punishment is acceptable to society, but in this case there is no proof of recklessness.

There is no single law stating that forensic confirmation is necessary to come to this conclusion. Of course, it is a major factor when weighing the evidence, but it is not necessary as you seem to say. 

I wholeheartedly disagree with the other assumption that people, apparantly by default (?) are incapable of estimating how fast a car is driving. Before you get at it: yes, I am aware about psycological research regarding witness testimonies. Granted: a witness testimony has to be compelling enough to accept that the driver was indeed speeding, but this immediatly brings me back to what I was actually trying to say: the court did not properly motivate why the evidence testimonies were discarded. It simply believes that the testimonies were coloured by the incident, and keeps it at that. 

There weren't even three separate paragraphs in the verdict for each of the evidence testimonies. No, what we are stuck with  are the 10 lines I referred to before to simply 'kill off' witness testimonies.  The judge got a pressing obligation to motivate such important decisions, and it did not uphold its legal obligation that regard. If it would have, a different decision *might have been possible*.

Once again. The people, or a part of it, indeed wants independence. They don't need a guide. In fact, ERC+CiU has had an absolute majority in seats for the bigger part of time since the so-called transition. This is the first time they pushed for a non-binding *consulta*, to back down to some even-less binding ""people's involvement"". An independence you don't beg for, you go for it.

&gt; I preffer to demonstrate that independentism is more social than people think

Quite the contrary. The official stance of ERC is that if they were to choose between independence and being left-wing, they'd choose independence. 

&gt; more social than people think and vote CUP for example

You have little understanding of la CUP. La CUP is about Libertarian Municipalism. They're in favour of abolishing the state, whether that'd be the Spanish one, be it the Catalan one.

I never said that.

&gt;Once again. The people, or a part of it, indeed wants independence. They don't need a guide. In fact, ERC+CiU has had an absolute majority in seats for the bigger part of time since the so-called transition. This is the first time they pushed for a non-binding consulta, to back down to some even-less binding ""people's involvement"". An independence you don't beg for, you go for it.

They've been *forced* by the people to do that. Do you even know who organised the demonstrations? It wasn't a party *or* the government, it was the catalan society

&gt;Quite the contrary. The official stance of ERC is that if they were to choose between independence and being left-wing, they'd choose independence.

Then you don't understand independentism. *Itself* is a social policy, that's the whole basis of CUP for example

&gt;You have little understanding of la CUP. La CUP is about Libertarian Municipalism. They're in favour of abolishing the state, whether that'd be the Spanish one, be it the Catalan one. Guanyem Barcelona is based on the same concept. It's about independence, but about independence of metropolitan areas. Barcelona independent, for example, or La Priorat lliure. I like that idea, because indeed, that's what matters, the city and its surroundings, and the parts that live in symbiosis.

You must be on a pretty heavy trip to affirm that. They just want independence *for the catalan countries out of the EU and Spain*

&gt;Why not? With a program like the one of Podemos, it's all or nothing.

It doesn't make sense to resign from government if people have voted for you to do it.

&gt;Goto /r/podemos a big chunk of voters would even feel treason if Podemos would enter a government with IU, if IU doesn't subscribe to the 20 points of Podemos. Their voters prefer opposition unless the program can be executed. You'll see, Podemos will win, won't be able to find an absolute majority on their program, and we'll have to sweat out 4 years of a government of concentration: PP+PSOE (+ maybe CiU). Just look at Greece.

That just means that they have no political experience and they need to do opposition.

No it is not. Judges must when *motivating* their verdict take into account the seriousness of the situation, and therefore the weighing of evidence demands thorough motivation. **That** is what I meant, not convicting someone when there is no legal ground to do so. The court did not uphold its legal requirements in motivating the verdict with respect to witness testimonies. The Hoge Raad has on multiple occassions redirected cases back to lower courts because the obligation to properly motivate a verdict becomes more strict when it is controversial in nature.

&gt; You haven't read my reply very well either, let me emphasise that again ""dood door schuld"". ""Verwijtbaar gedrag"" speelt hier een grote rol.

And what did you say again?

&gt; My opinion is we do not lock people up because they make an unforseen mistake, at which their **consious** behaviour did not atribute to.

To which their conscious behavior did not attribute to. Jclad, ignoring your response madness on /r/europe and your seeming urge to always prove that you are 'right', I can say the following: dood door schuld, out of my own personal legal experience also takes into consideration unconscious behavior. If you want to prove to me now that this is not the case, then do so directly. If not, I will **conclude** that you withdraw your earlier statement. 

Dood door schuld reaches further than conscious behavior under the current penal code, and it also considers 'onbewuste schuld'. I advise that you study the law more properly before coming to such conclusions.

This is not my point. What I meant is a lack of conclusive evidence that he was, or a contrario, was not, speeding. The forensic report basically says that what happened was 'undecided', given the large bandwith. 'Safely controlled up to 132 km/h' is of course related to the experience of the driver: speeding does in general increase the risk of losing control when the driver loses his/her attention.

But I don't want to talk about the report, as the judge has also implictly stated that the report does not exhonorate the accused. What I find more important is this:

&gt; Then how is this not a reason to discard the testimonies wrt the speed?

This is a reason to discard witness testimonies, but it still demands motivation. The court seems to assume that witnesses *by default* cannot properly estimate speed. That might be so for the majority of the people out there, but it cannot be excluded that that witnesses were right in the end, or that at least one of them was. 

The witnesses could have been subjected to forensic trials in the exact same situation, and asked to estimate speed in a multitude of trials. That would do much more service to truth than simply thinking that witnesses are incapable of estimating speed.

&gt;The __Polish population transfers__ from the former eastern [territories of Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic), also known as the expulsion of Poles from the [Kresy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kresy) regions,  towards the end – and in the aftermath – of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), refer to the [forced migrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_migration) of [Poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poles) occurring between 1944–1946. It was an official Soviet policy which targeted over a million Polish citizens. They were removed from the [Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_areas_annexed_by_the_Soviet_Union), which were incorporated into the Ukrainian, Belarusian and Lithuanian [SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union) following the [Tehran Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran_Conference) of 1943.

Actually, no.

There is no question he is profoundly corrupt.  The only reason he and his henchmen haven't been caught yet is that his wrongdoings always end up being *technically* legal, or he is *technically* not involved.

For example, in the criminal investigation that got José Socrates' right-hand man, Armando Vara, jailed for corruption, the Face Oculta case, José Socrates was also involved and he was caught in judicial wiretaps discussing his participation in the corruption scheme.  Even then, the supreme court president decided on a whim to throw away that evidence, and also ordered the wiretaps to be destroyed, without providing any good reason beyond a ""because I said so"".

When in office, he passed legislation for specific tax breaks on money transfers just so that he would not pay any taxes when he moved money to and from his offshore accounts.  And he did this twice.

He set up the national educational laptops program so that it was paid by the state but handled through a private foundation that was designed to received millions and spend them without leaving a single auditable trace. 

His government decided to purchase military helicopters through a leasing scheme through the infamous Banco Espírito Santo that ended up increasing their cost by 160%, without leaving any trail regarding where the money went.

When he was minister of the environment, he unilaterally ordered the approval of a construction license for a mall in an ecological reserve, claiming that it was a national interest project.

Also, when he was responsible for picking the location of Lisbon's new international airport, even though the technical reports indicated Rio Frio as the overall best location for the airport, he mysteriously ordered the project to be built on the infamous village of Ota, justifying his choice as being a purely political.

Putin is already searching for a way to go back without appearing to do so (see the whole deal with promise Ukraine won't be in NATO). If EU politicians are any good they won't accept and force Russia to offer better deals.

Russia has to pay for a war they can't afford politicaly to win. They have to send soldiers there without confirming they are even fighting. Meanwhile they have to switch infrastructure from west to east, where they are going to get less for the same amount of gas. Meanwhile they have to use reserves to keep ruble from falling further. Already they have similar level of reserves as in record lows in 2008. Meanwhile no financing in the western banks, no western technology, and FDI is leaving in hurry. And if they want to play the 
no gas in winter"" card - they will lose even more money and end up with a big budget deficit.

How long can you do that?

Ukraine won't spend more money on occupied lands, so Russia will have to provide for them - food, drugs, money for people on budget salary, repairing destroyed infrastructure. If Russia won't pay - these regions will have humanitarian catastrophe. No doubt this will help ""freedom fighters"" popularity there.

Ukraine just needs to wait this out. The only way Russia can win is to invade the rest of Ukraine openly. I doubt this will happen, even Putin isn't as dumb.

We get to a point of agreement here. *Forced*, that is exactly the right word. Not a voluntary move.

&gt; Then you don't understand independentism. Itself is a social policy, 

The left is international. It's *not* a social policy, because socialism is about people, not about nationalities.

&gt; that's the whole basis of CUP for example

No, they're proto-anarchists. Anarchists don't care about nations/states. They care about cities. That's why la CUP is leftwing, and ERC is not.

&gt; You must be on a pretty heavy trip to affirm that. They just want independence for the catalan countries out of the EU and Spain

As a first step. Maybe some of their voters want just independence for *els països catalans* and nothing more, in the same way some fascists that voted for el PP will do so for Podemos next time, in the same way some left people vote for the rightwing C's, or some of the workers still vote for that socialist and *obrero* (sic) party. Don't confuse party and voters. Elections should be with nameless parties, that way people would vote programs, not labels.

&gt; It doesn't make sense to resign from government if people have voted for you to do it.

It makes a lot of sense if you feel your program is worth more than having some minister-posts, and you'll be unable to execute 90% of your program, because your coalition partner doesn't want any of that. Do you think the PP and ERC could form a coalition? Why not? ^(there's your answer)

&gt; That just means that they have no political experience

Compared to the PP?

&gt; What you are suggesting would probably cripple the spanish democracy (what little is left for it)

Democracy is direct voting. We're living a parliamentary monarchy. Get rid of the king and you'd have a republic. Although a republic claims to be a democracy, it's not. It get's close to it, and it could even be a better system, but it's not democracy.

false,Parabellum8g,NETH,Indifference is the best kind of tolerance (/s),"Well, that's the pickle: the court does not rule out the possiblity that speeding was in play here. Let me quote a part of the verdict:

&gt; Nu uit de objectieve onderzoeksresultaten *niet met voldoende mate van zekerheid* kan worden vastgesteld dat verdachte, voordat zijn auto begon te slingeren, te hard heeft gereden en de rechtbank het bewijs voor dit onderdeel van de tenlastelegging ...(NB: volgt niet bewezen verklaring)

So, in other words, this verdict basically still results in a lot of questions as so much remains uncertain. My hope is vested in the Gerechtshof to overturn what happened here, at least when it comes down to motivating the verdict. 

Edit: to add to this, and your comment that speeding is being ruled out as the cause (sorry, I apparantly misread), I want to quote the following section:

&gt; De rijproeven met een soortgelijke auto als die van verdachte, waaruit is gebleken dat met een snelheid van 132 kilometer per uur nog door de bocht kon worden gereden zonder dat de auto oncontroleerbaar zou worden, sluiten niet uit dat de auto van verdachte door een eventuele andere oorzaak is gaan slingeren.

This looks to be an indication of whether speed was an issue here, but the court does not rule out speed in my opinion.  It simply states that driving through the corner at 132 km/h is still possible, but this should not be 1 on 1  translated to the accused his own driving capabilities. Quite possibly the accused is a terrible driver, and it also does not exclude that speeding in general increases risks involved. If the accused for example happened to be driving 124 km/h (or 120 in that matter) there is considerable risk involved in driving so close to what the road actually allows.

You're confusing socialism *with social policies*. 

&gt;No, they're proto-anarchists. Anarchists don't care about nations/states. They care about cities. That's why la CUP is leftwing, and ERC is not.

Again, in Catalonia, independentism is pursued to gain social rights, so  what's the point of independence if you don't have a country to begin with? They're not anarchists

&gt;Don't confuse party and voters. Elections should be with nameless parties, that way people would vote programs, not labels.

It's not some voters, it's everyone outside some crazies on the hard core of the organitzation

&gt;It makes a lot of sense if you feel your program is worth more than having some minister-posts, and you'll be unable to execute 90% of your program, because your coalition partner doesn't want any of that. Do you think the PP and ERC could form a coalition? Why not?

That's why I don't like populists, it's a maniequism: either we do it our way or we won't do nothing, they are not open to negotiation even if they try to appear as dialogant.

&gt;Compared to the PP?

PP is crap, but they are governing. They have and *are* organising a state, even if they do it poorly. It isn't easy, you know?

&gt;Democracy is direct voting. We're living a parliamentary monarchy. Get rid of the king and you'd have a republic. Although a republic claims to be a democracy, it's not. It get's close to it, and it could even be a better system, but it's not democracy. Democracy is having a population of let's say 100 persons, those 100 persons coming together and getting to some kind of consensus. The current system is a representative mob-rule.

This is not representative democracy (what we currently have) but direct democracy, and thus anarchism. *It does not work* in a modern country nor it would in our world.

You seem to misinterpret the situation. It is about Catalonia (cultural entity, a.k.a. nation) versus Spain (cultural entity again.) 

Out of Spain 89% has Spanish as their first language. 9% Catalan, 5% Galician,1% Basque. 

So you see that Catalan, Galician and Basque are minorities in Spain. 

before Madrid, so by that definition Madrid would be a minority too. It has more population than both castiles. Basque country is not relatively small also.
Check this numbers here, under Distribución de la población (I'm sorry I can't link properly) http://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demografía_de_España

You are confusing Comunidad Autonoma with cultural groups. Not the same. Madrid, both Castilles, Extremadura... They are all part of the same majority cultural group. 

""Also by my definition (maybe is not the official one)""

There is no such thing as ""my definition"". If everybody has its own definition of words, communication doesn't work. I recommend you to use definitions common to everybody, as seen in dictionaries, Wikipedia...

In your previous post, you implied that minority's was only a matter of size and that both Catalonia and Basque were too big. Oh well. 


""a minority is a group that is being oppressed and is fighting for its rights, things that can't be applied with Cataluña and País Vasco.""

Actually, both are being oppressed. Spanish government uses the force of law to prevent the to exercise democratic and inalienable right of self determination. The separation of powers is non existent. Exclusive local competencies are being trampled and ignored by the Federal government. Their cultures are being ignored or worst, attached and ridiculed. Hate offering against them is used as an electoral weapon by all Spanish political sides.

Poll after poll, 80+ % seems to be in favour of *la consulta*, and around 35% voted sí-sí the 9/11.

false,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"So, I've been part of a group organising and leading many of these protests - Socialist Party, which is the leader of the ""We Won't Pay"" movement, which is a campaign of civil disobedience. 

As a result of Ireland's bailout, which was needed for several reasons from the economic crisis - but primarily that we decided not to ""burn the bondholders"", as we say it, we are paying for 42% of the entire European bank debt - the IMF got a promise from the government that they would introduce water charges and the metering of water. 

Ireland, historically, has never had metered water. It was attempted in the 90's and was defeated then, as well. Water has always been paid through taxes and has been a service in the public good. 

What has got us so upset about these new austerity measures is quite a few different things, some of which I will really only touch on briefly;

1. The government claimed we had ended austerity

2. This is just another thing in a list of scandals, incompetency and corruption stories from this government

3. It is something that effects everybody. 

Now, for point 3. The general population has, in the past, accepted austerity measures because they primarily effected specific groups, and even then it was primarily hurting the public sector - like health, education, civil services etc. 

Now that we have a very serious austerity measure being inflicted on everybody - including the poorest of the poor, those who literally cannot afford to pay at all, those who are already unable to pay for their mortgages, those with families not able to make end's meet - we have a mass mobilisation of people who are against this new charge. There were similar attempts in the past for things such as the Property Tax, and during the Celtic Tiger years with the privatisation of Bin Collection services, but both failed because they failed to achieve widespread, grassroots support. Not to mention, many other, arguably greater, austerity measures, like the Universal Social Charge, are hidden, and are harder for people to grasp and get annoyed about. 

This movement against Water Charges *has* achieved widespread, grassroots support. People are marching in their tens of thousands, hundreds of people are attending spontaneous street meetings against the government, it's become a very serious mass movement.

To add salt to the wounds, one of the people heading the installation of the Water Meters is an Irish oligarch and media mogul, Denis O'Brien. 

The utility responsible for enacting all of these things is called Irish Water.

So, to summarise what I have written so far;

1. Due to the bailout, the Troika demanded metered water

2. Ireland has never had metered water despite past attempts

3. This affects so many people it has lead to mass mobilisation

4. People are sick of government lies and corruption

5. There is clear corruption of Irish Water and it is benefiting Oligarchs

On top of all this, one of the biggest things the government claims this was being pushed for was water conservation. This is a total farce, as in the latest government concessions to the population, it has restructured the water payments in such a way that water conservation is totally irrelevant and not incentivised in the slightest.

To make matters worse, Denis O'Brien's media and pro-government media, as well as the government itself, has compared the mass movement to terrorists, Republican dissidents(i.e. IRA), and even ISIS and has went on active smear campaigns of Sinn Féin(A left-wing opposition party), the Socialist Party - even claiming that we must be suppressed in order to maintain law and order, and against the protesters in general claiming that we're violent thugs. 

Luckily, the population does not believe any of these lies and this continued media and smear campaign has only made everybody angrier. 

The government has also lied, saying that they have guaranteed in legislation that it will not be privatised. This is untrue, this guarantee expires in 2019, which has added massively to our suspicions that privatisation is a priority in the long term. This fear could be assuaged with a constitutional amendment(Which would pass massively) assuring that water will never be privatised. 

However, the government also claims that prices will not rise, that services will be improved, and so on. We can see that this has not been the case in the UK, and we can also see with the privatisation of our *own* bin services(As I mentioned earlier) that is has lead to duplication of labour, higher prices, and overall extremely inefficient use of resources with no benefit to the general population. This is not something we do not want to repeat in any circumstances.

The government also claims that these water charges are necessary in order to fix our outdated pipelines - which wastes about 50% of the water that passes through them. The government has lied, the money from the water charges is going to service our debts that we took on the behalf of the bondholders, just the same as our Property Tax was meant to go to maintenance of land, but the benefits are absolutely nowhere to be seen.

On top of this, we have massively outdated sewerage systems which pump untreated waste into rivers or seas of about 44 towns and cities around Ireland. The government has said nothing about fixing this.

So people are very angry about all of this. The government has consistently lied about the reasons for the Water Charges, the government and friendly media has tried to demonise the population it's meant to be representing, the government is clearly working in the interests of oligarchs, not in the interests of the population, and it's trying to take an *essential* service out of the public good, and ultimately, into private hands. And the government is treating opposition to all of this as if it's a fringe element with no support - like it's a joke. It has essentially said exactly that.

false,Parabellum8g,NETH,Indifference is the best kind of tolerance (/s),"- In one of a series of reports published by the watchdog, a primary school pupil at East London Islamic School told inspectors he believed he would “go to hell” if he participated in music or dance.


- Ofsted said that at Mazahirul Uloom School, a secondary school for boys, pupils were unable to tell inspectors which of sharia law or English law was more important. “Students presented a narrow view of the role of females in society. Some students told inspectors that ‘women stay at home and clean and look after the children. They cook and pray and wait for us to come back in from school and help with homework’,” the inspectors reported.


- “One posting states that any sixth-form students who attended a leavers’ party and engaged in ‘free-mixing’ or ‘listening to music’ would face ‘severe consequences later’,” inspectors noted.


Reading this, I would say that the damage has already been done. Giving any time for 'urgent changes' will come down to combatting what has been taught earlier, probably by the same people who taught such ideas. The only way these schools could be allowed to exist is screening each and every teacher for their ideas on the education system in general, as well as checking what the vision of each teacher is on what has been taught before in relation with British (if not in general Western) values. 

Those that fail the test should be fired and barred from teaching to safeguard that such backwards ideas cannot spread under children. Above all: the current people in charge of said schools should not be given a second chance, as they were in the end responsible for this situation. 

If such a reassessment of staff and the people responsible is not agreeable with the school boards said instutions should be closed  immediatly. There is no time to waste in combating such negligence in educational responsibility. ",0,1416676174,null,0,false,0,cm9wm6g,t3_2n2psr,t1_cm9wm6g,t3_2n2psr,null,1425895576,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

Was Ich mich in letzter Zeit öfters frage:

Wie sah das ganze vor der Ukrainekrise jetzt real aus? War der Integrationsgrad der Russen in die bestehenden globalen oder westlichen Organisationen so lächerlich und die abgrenzenden Spaltung zwischen dem Westen und Russland so groß, dass sich rational tatsächlich eine Gegenposition gegen den Westen ableiten kann? Ich kann das einfach nicht beurteilen.

Ich meine, die sollten ja ursprünglich zb bei diesem missile-defense-system dabei sein und wirtschaftlich waren die mit Deutschland unter Schröder ja auch dicke. Also was rechtfertigt diese Aggression und staatlich finanzierte mediale Propaganda gegenüber dem Westen (siehe das als Graswurzelmedium getarnte Staatsmedium RT) - was ja jetzt wahrlich auch genug Gegenaggression aus dem Westen nach sich gezogen hat?

Ich mach(t)e da auch irgendwie subjektiv eine Ambivalenz der Sichtweisen aus: Nach innen hatte ich immer den Eindruck dass Russland in D bis 2012/2013 gut wegkam. Für mich als jungen Mensch war bis dato faktisch kein realer, politischer Konflikt mit Russland vorhanden. Ist mir nie in den Sinn gekommen, dass da jemals nochmal kriegerische Konflikte durch Westen-Osten Konflikte entstehen. Und wenn man sich die russische Sichtweise auf den Westen anschaut(e) sieht man, dass oft suggeriert wird, dass der Westen schon immer total antirussisch war und gar keinen Fick auf die Russen gibt. Nach Pussy Riot und westlicher Kritik hat sich das dann maßgeblich intensiviert bis heute sogar RT Deutsch Propaganda betreibt.

Ich bin deshalb noch nicht dahinter gekommen, ob die Ukrainekrise ein an sich **nachvollziehbarer** Ausbruch aufgestauter Angst/Ressentiment/Machtverlustsbefürchtungen vor dem Westen ist, oder nur quasi ein komplett künstlicher und daher unnötiger Konflikt, der geopolitische Interessen durchsetzen soll und die russische Gesellschaft antiwestlich  einstimmen soll? Wurde hier im Sub nichtmal ein Artikel mit der Thematik der ""Heroisierung"" gepostet? Das würde hier gut passen.

I refrained from saying where I'm from for thinking it would disencourage people from answering me because how I imagine other people look at my people as if they were weight on their shoulders rather than people constructively contributing to a country's economy that treats them well... 
I'm from Damascus and the reason why I said I don't feel like I belong here anymore is because the atmosphere, even though relatively safe compared to other regions in Syria, is really nonconstructive... Systematic power outages and poor internet bandwidth irritates the **** outta me. Not mentioning having to put a freaking proxy on or using a VPN even if you just wanna take a crap. Downloading from Playstore is blocked... Amazon is blocked.. Paypal is blocked... Unity Engine site and products are blocked... it's just really ugly. And they're the one who blocked us because the U.S. sanctioned Syria in terms of ""luxury products""... Thus it's tedious to download blocked stuff for the slow/expensive workarounds I have to go though...

Aside from that crap going on, since I have a lot of free time when power is off, I'm investing it in reading programming books both high and low level and learning from game dev materials... And I thought maybe I could learn some new language. At first I thought about Japanese (just for the heck of it, cuz it's fun) and because there's a multitude of game development companies in Japan. So maybe my professional role would be a technical representative in some company for Japanese affiliates even in a company outside Japan. Then I also thought about German and French. Though the thought of learning French instantly vaporized from my head for how boring I've always found it back at school when they taught us French and English(no offense to French guys. My cousin had his PhD in nanophysics from France!).
 
Anyways, I know German language is a language of science and innovations... And I, myself, am really looking forward to achieving some great ideas in my mind like DNA computers(Planning to read a book on that field right after I get the hang of it with making some compiler).
In fact, I just started learning German today, and as you said I noticed A LOT of similarities between Germany and English (unsurprisingly because they originate from the same Latin root).

Whether I'm going to pursue my postgraduate degree and work in Germany or another country, I'm sure it would be a great add-on on my CV. And I believe I made the right choice, right after my initial post I head to Doulingo app when power was off and finished the Basics 1 pack in no time, and to be honest it's quite fun and similar to English which makes the learning process easier. Not mentioning being able to practice it with my gaming friends from Germany that I used to talk to in English.

Your reply just cranked up my enthusiasm even more, thank you for the thoughtful and elaborate answer.
Regarding keeping the enthusiasm going, I have no problem with that :P I've been learning multiple programming concepts and couple programming languages for a year now, and it just gets more and more fun the longer I do it :P And thankfully I had your problem of jumping between many stuff I want to learn to an extent where I learned my way around and started learning related or similar things procedurally while at the same time learning many things that are not related to each other (e.g. learning Assembly basics THEN starting with reverse engineering, that's procedural; they relate to each other and one depends on the other.

It's criticism.. how does it suddenly become anti-German? 

&gt;Why does sir Dyson refer to the Germans, while the Germans alone are not the policy makers in the EU? I completely agree with his point of view that lobbyists should not have so much of a say in the legislation proces - preferably even no say - but the simple fact that he directs it 'German bullies' is not really fair.


Because he feels that Germany lobbyists have dictated what the law should be. A BDI spokesman said: 

“The UK has a different position because industry's share of GDP there is much smaller, around 10 percent compared with 25 percent in Germany.”“Maybe in a comparable way, London as a banking centre is far ahead and weighs more heavily in such questions from the British side.” 

They just looked after their own industry. 





&gt;Also: don't forget that sir Dyson got his own interests in changing legislation, as it would strengthen the market position of Dyson.

Yeah, there were wiretaps where Socrates was caught in cahoots with all the other corrupt bastards, and the judge mysteriously orders that evidence to be suppressed and destroyed.

That's sainthood material right there.

&gt; It was Socrates government who after ordering a study to Instituto Nacional de Engenharia that decided to follow with the decision of the study and chose Rio Frio. This was after decades of studies around Ota. 

Bullshit.

I've actually read the NAER study.  Have you?

It clearly states right in the end that in spite Rio Frio being by far the best option, Socrates himself picked Ota out of a whim based only on political reasons.

&gt; You have to understand rulling a country is about making decisions

Oh, I understand allright.

And this José Socrates bastard kept on making decisions that benefitted him personally and everyone around him.

Such as the magical penal law reform at the brink of the Casa Pia child abuse scandal, where his pals Ferro Rodrigues, Jaime Gama and Paulo Pedroso were caught sexually abusing the orphans of Casa Pia.  Magically Socrates' government ordered a reform that lead to an unexplainable automatic pardon for all jail sentences of first offenders who were found guilty of crimes whose jail sentence was less than 5 years, which conveniently fitted all his cronies like a glove.

Then all the PS child abusers were dropped from the process on a technicality, and they still kept the reform just in case.

&gt; and you will never satisfy everyone, after years of study poiting to Ota they were going with the Ota, millions were already spent.

At that time there was no project.  They were still picking up the place where the airport was going to be built.  That was the whole reason for that study: to pick the spot.

And the spot Socrates picked was absurd and utter bullshit.

Ota was such a bad choice that the entire civil society opposed that decision.  The Ordem of Engenheiros took very public positions against it, and the Confederação de Indústria Portuguesa was so hardly againt that bullshit that it decided to pay for an independent study out of their own pocket.  That study ended up pointing out Alcochete, because it was by far the best alternative overall.

Basically because the Germans are reasonably being portrayed as some kind of policy dictators here. But that is not the main reason: all legislation in the EU, save some special provisions, are subject to qualified majority voting. Before there can *even be* talk of voting, the European Commission needs to decide on a draft proposal.

if the EC does not give in because of German lobbyists, then it still remains a problem of the entirety of the EU, that is the power that lobbyists tend to wield in the proces of legislation. If I'm not mistaken as many as 10.000 lobbyists are operating in Brussels today.

It cannot be seen as a 'German' problem, as the multinational European Commission needs to decide on draft proposals. 

&gt; Which didn't happen and that's why he's saying what's the point if everythings done to what Germany wants?

It did not happen, but it would still strenghten the market position of Dyson if it *were* to happen. You cannot deny that sir Dyson, next to German companies of course, has his own interests in how this situation should play out.

But I never attributed it to the supernatural, demons, god or the devil. In my early years, I accustomed myself to it and even enjoyed the adrenaline rush. I wasn't consumed by fear. All religion or belief in the supernatural does is to fill that void with fables and fear and trauma so as to gain power over you. Priests do it, parents do it. Mine never did though. Guess what, the whole sleep paralysis thing is scientifically explained. So, it went from meh to ok, that makes sense now.

A good example being Enoch Powell, a politician in Britain who was actually the most popular man in the country for a short while, after he made his infamous ""rivers of blood"" speech over the impact of mass immigration and multiculturalism on native communities.

Despite his message resonating with the public, he was denounced by every party including his own, he was deemed a racist bigot and literally compared with the Nazis (even though he was promoted multiple times during his time as an officer in WW2, who fought against the Nazis) and he was condemned to the political wilderness for the rest of his life.

Enoch Powell himself had actually visited the West Indies during his time as Secretary for Health, and recruited several thousand Asian doctors to immigrate to Britain and work for the NHS (something made easier because at least at that time, medical schools in that part of the world used English textbooks and spoke in English due to colonial history), thus showing he was no enemy of immigration, simply mass immigration and multiculturalism as opposed to integration.

First of all, getting the organisation of the state in order is top priority. We all know what is important in that regard, so I will refrain from commenting about that.

Once a stable state of law has been achieved, strengthening international cooperation as well as democracy internally will give a boost to people's trust and connections with the international playing field, which will in turn strengthen the economy and overall satisfaction. 

As long as a state is prosperous and respects human dignity, people on average will be satisfied. What I do notice however is that citizens will continue to ask for *more*, and are in the end never completely pleased. But as long as progress keeps going on in both economical, political and legal dimensions, this can be compensated for.

Those are some of the factors required for progress, although other people will surely be able to name a lot more.

It isn't primarily the speed that caused the accident (one could obviously safely take the turn at very high speed given the lack of adverse weather conditions) but the fact that he cut the corner and was startled when he saw traffic coming from the other side (these are the witnesses). As such I believe he is guilty.

However, there is no way the witnesses could have seen this with certainty. Due to the hedge that obstructs the view (note: the witnesses say the distance they saw him at went from 200m to 75m) they could not have seen him approach the corner on the wrong side of the road. If he had lost control before (as he claims) it would have looked exactly the same to them.

The fact that all witnesses came from the other side makes it even impossible to estimate the speed, I fully agree with the court on this one. They were approaching at about 70 km/h so the speed difference was somewhere from 150 km/h (best case) to 190 km/h (worst case). There is no way people can tell these apart. Also note that based on their testimony they had only 2.4s to see the car (125m @ 190 km/h speed difference) which makes it even harder to estimate its speed correctly. 

My verdict: almost certainly guilty but there's no way a higher judge is going to convict him as there isn't sufficient evidence. He's also a lying bastard (wrt the position of the sun and him looking at the speed meter).

I think Russia can be described--if I can make a gross generalizaiton--as the inheritor of the orientalized, caesaropapist, autocratic Byzantine political tradition, which took its roots ultimately from the practices of Persia rather than Rome (I think it was Diocletian who really put that in motion).  The West, in contrast, was a mixed bag, with princes, nobles and popes vying for temporal power in the wake of the collapse of the Roman state.

The West had a very self-conscious reclamation of Pagan antiquity (philosophy, republicanism), starting with the Renaissance and continuing through the Enlightenment and modern period.  Russia caught on to some of these currents, but never quite digested them.  There has always been a tremendous tension there and suspicion of the West.  Just read, like, all of Russian literature from the 19th century.

The international furor over the annexation announcement caused Izvolsky to drop the Dardanelles Straits question, altogether, in an effort to obtain a European conference over the Bosnian Annexation. This conference never materialized and without British or French support, the Russians and their client state, Serbia, were compelled to accept the Austrian-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia Herzegovina in March 1909.

This was the process according to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina).

false,OWKuusinen,FINL,Finland,"&gt;I don't understand how Google's market-share could be called a monopoly or why it is problematic. 

There's this thing called natural monopoly. It means that while the market itself is open for new competitors, the costs of entering the market for new enterprises are higher than the profits would be (under any sane timeframe).

&gt;And there is nothing stopping consumers for switch to a different service. 

The consumers are the marketing companies which go where the end-users are. And the end-users use Google because none of the listed alternatives really work.

For example, Bing isn't really a competitor for Google-search because it doesn't seem to contextualise world outside America at all well. For example, I just now tried for the search ""helsingin sanomat reddit"", trying to find a news piece concerning this site on the biggest newspaper (Helsingin Sanomat or HS) in the country and on the first page only one search result was a newspiece about reddit. The two first results weren't even links that had anything direct to do with either of them!( [1](http://www.womex.com/virtual/helsingin_sanomat), [2](http://imgur.com/r/MapPorn/PXwzL8O)). 
Meanwhile all the results on the google-search direct to HS- newspieces about reddit or (on one occasion) to a reddit-thread about a newspiece from said paper. 

This isn't of course only about search algorithms but also about google knowing a lot about their end-users, something that Bing can't even start doing because they don't have any. 

You could try to circumvent this by pouring a huge amount of money into it but most European cultures are too small for this to make any sense.

Given the amount of Poles in my city we have serious issues with Polish organized crime too, but its *far* from the case that all Poles are bad. US immigration laws are probably more strict but the notion nobody can immigrate without a PhD is false. Most of the Eastern European immigrants we get are not educated. They become educated when they get here or at the least make sure their children get educated. 

&gt;work for a couple months then get fired so they can get welfare benefits and then they just go back to Romania while still being registered here in Western Europe so they can collect their welfare checks.

If that is true, that should change. Germany seems to be leading the charge here. The ECJ recently limited the amount of welfare benefits Germany has to pay non-Germans residing there. So maybe the NL or the ECJ will reign this in soon. That is not how it should work. I can see how taxpayers are frustrated with some programs though. I met a Dutch guy in Thailand who was rejected for the Dutch special forces. Because it was such a time commitment the NL gave him a benefit. I can totally see giving someone a temporary income and education benefit. He invested a substantial amount of time, but the NL was giving him something like EUR1,800 per month *for life* (he was classified as retired). Even if this was a very special case I felt like it was unfair for taxpayers. This guy was perfectly fine to do something else, and could have went to school and trained for it, yet hes being paid to travel for the rest of his life. So I can see how you would find some programs unfair. 

&gt;if I immigrate to the US I'll adapt to the culture, live like an American so I can fit in.

Nobody really expects that. If you speak English (which you already do) and follow the law you are pretty good. I really to think that something that makes the US special is the fact so many people actually retain much of their culture but also fit in just fine. You can see [some of this](http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/arts/culturebox/2014/05/CBOX_BlattLanguage_2.jpg.CROP.original-original.jpg) here. I dont think most people associate Texas with Vietnamese people, but there is a *huge* population there, as well as all across the south. Houston actually beats Chicago and New York as the most diverse city in the US (despite all the comments on Reddit about Texas being only white and all rednecks) The Hispanic population in TX is *huge* as well, and will surpass whites in several years. Hispanics already surpassed whites in California. You will see heavy Hispanic influence in both of these states (and most of the US to be honest) and people dont expect them to leave their culture at the door. Just speak the language and follow the law. 

If you are familiar with the US, my state is ""Polish"" on that map. We do have some issues with them doing business without a license, doing business in cash to avoid taxes, etc. But that is often because they are doing things the way they did them back home. Their kids are American in every sense of the word (and many of them become 'Americanized' as well), but they still retain a fair amount of their culture.

Eh

Non si può decidere caso per caso, serve un principio certo. Tra la legalità e la giustizia è meglio la legalità perchè è oggettiva e nel lungo periodo è anche maggiore garanzia di giustizia.


&gt; ed è benissimo che il legislatore cambi la legge per eliminare questa stronzata. 

Si e no.

Se ne può ovviamente parlare, come dicevo in un altro post in alcuni paesi la prescrizione neanche esiste, ma non come reazione di pancia a una sentenza particolare. Il processo legislativo deve passare per la testa, mai per la pancia, e mi sembra che in questo momento ci sia troppa emotività per affrontare il discorso in modo lucido.

But yeah as a native speaker of a Semitic language, chances are high that German works better for you than Japanese. University here is cheaper as well so if you want to study in a foreign country, German is probably the better option. But Master's degrees are also offered in English in Germany. Not all of them but a lot.

And don't worry, I've got lots of people running around at uni that are from another country and if there's somebody whose a burden than it's the Germans that drop out after the third semester because they would rather get drunk than study for exams and not the foreigners who are working their ass off trying to get a Bachelor in Computer Science all in German :D

And if you don't want to go to Germany, German opens up a lot of possibilities in terms of language for the Netherlands, Belgium and the Nordics (except Finland because that's a whole other language family people have theorised to be related to Japanese... If you don't speak Turkish, neither Arabic nor English nor German nor French will help there). But you can't do much with those languages. So learning German now whilst you're not bound to a certain country will make it easier to learn all the other Germanic languages if you have to. Because English is the odd one with their borrowing from Latin and French. All the other Germanic languages are much more obviously related.

So good luck with your studies. But don't let it creep up on you. If you feel like something robs your motivation, try to change your methods up a little. I had a lot of problems with that and Japanese.

Well, in that case, I agree with you. European welfare benefits are more generous. Also, I would say the mindset is different in many cases.

The Christmas tradition of having Santa Claus bring presents is religious.

The Soviets replaced it with the secular tradition of having Grandpa Frost bring presents. It's a much more inclusive and humanist holiday, and in my opinion, it's better for Christians as well - it allows Christmas to be a religious experience rather than a consumerist one. 

Just because something is ""Soviet-era"" doesn't mean it's bad. I'm quite pro-Ukrainian, but this is a crappy development. 

In fact, the article itself says something similar: 

&gt;But unlike Christmas, New Year celebrations in Russia and Ukraine are nearly universal and are embraced by people who consider themselves atheists or are followers of religions that do not celebrate Christmas, such as Jews.

Send the Mod UE, and ignore all subsequent correspondence from them. Used the one from[ Abmahnwahn](http://www.abmahnwahn-dreipage.de/mod-ue/#mu03), you don't need to pay another lawyer to do that for you.

To give you an idea what will most likely happen after:

* They will send you another letter stating that they received your Modifizierte Unterlassungserklärung (never sign the one they sent you, as it's admitting to far more than you have to). In this letter they will remind you that you still have to pay them money. Ignore.
* They might send a letter after the deadline they set in the very first one has passed, with an offer to pay them in 3 or 4 installments. Also ignore that
* They might send you another one or two, demanding you pay. Again, ignore.
* I even got a letter 1 or 1,5 years after all this went down, still demanding to pay up. Ignored that one as well, haven't heard from them in about 2 years now. 

You'll be fine. Do not send them any communication other than the Mod UE, also don't call. Everything you give them can be used against you, so just don't. If they really bring it in front of a judge: don't ignore that letter, fill it out, deny everything. Nothing more will come of it. All they wanna do is scare you into paying. They don't want to go through the trouble of actually suing you. It's easier for them to just send out a bunch of letters.

The usual reason for asking it isn't to ask about the religious beliefs of babies, though. It's usually about the conflation of religion-as-group-identity and religion-as-set-of-beliefs. People talk about a muslim/christian/whatever child in order to claim it for their own group (and then sometimes go on to make claims about how it should be treated based on what it 'should' believe later - eg, circumcision or apostasy). Atheist, naturally, tend to dislike this.

Personally I suspect that different people have a different propensity to religious feeling, which is then influenced by the environment they're in. So maybe some people are almost literally born atheists, some primed to pick up whatever religion they're exposed to in a big way.

a) do nothing: risk unknown. You can keep doing this (ignoring further letters) until a letter not from a lawyer but from court arrives. Then you *have* to act and then you should get a lawyer. This happens rarely (way less than 1% of people) but it does happen.

There also appear to be cases where they send a letter once a year (but never try to go to court) so just when you think you can forget the whole thing, bang, it's back on your mind.

b) sign the letter and pay: This is the ""easiest"" option, the least nervecracking. They will leave you alone after that.

The big risk is: You admit fault. You agree to not do again what specifically is stated in the letter. Typically to not upload (""öffentlich zur Verfügung stellen""=torrent) movies or songs marketed by a specific company (in your case probably Warner). *IF* you or somebody else uses your connection for that again and they catch you, it will be *really* expensive. Your letter probably states something to that end.

c) Send a ""mod UE."" Essentially you take their letter, take out the parts you don't like, don't admit fault, don't pay but agree to be a good boy. This is too tricky to word properly even for a German so you pick a premade one from the internet that has been written with the help of a lawyer and fill in your details. 

There are a few catches: 

* You still have to agree to not upload something but you can e.g. narrow it down to that one movie they claim.

* They can still go to court if they feel like it. (This is the one advantage of just paying: They can not take you to court for this issue any more.) They have 3 fucking years to decide, after that it's verjährt; barred

* Be sure to fill in the right details. Get the help of a german friend. Like, don't agree to not upload the movie ""Beispiel"" by company ""Mustermann"" ;) **Sign it!** (but not the original letter, that goes to your files, not back)

* You *can* also modify the letter, not admit fault, but still pay. Pointless IMO unless you first try to negotiate to pay, but less. Chance of success: unknown.

In effetti la prima volta che sento parlare del mansionario. Avere un bello stipendio e nessuna responsabilità credo sia il sogno di molti comunque.

&gt;Se ti aumentano solo lo stipendio possono tranquillamente assorbire il lordo se la retribuzione di aumenta in altro modo: [link](http://guide.supereva.it/diritti_dei_lavoratori/interventi/2010/03/il-superminimo-assorbibile).

Chiaro, ma afaik non sempre il superminimo è assorbibile. 

&gt; Ti faccio un esempio che faceva la mia vecchia azienda. A giugno scadevano i permessi dell'anno prima, quindi dovrebbero pagarli (poco, ma comunque devono pagarli), ma col superminimo assorbibile possono far scendere i soldi da una parte e mantenere il lordo uguale.

Sicuro che questo sia legale? Non ho mai sentito parlare di questa roba, e sicuramente nessuno qui è mai azzardato a fare una cosa del genere. Da quanto ne suo pagare i permessi e possibile, non obbligatorio. Detrarli dal superminimo? Piuttosto prendo i miei permessi e mando a puttane il progetto.


&gt; La cosa vale per molte voci della busta paga, pure il premio di produzione credo (ma qui non sono sicuro, chiedo l'aiuto del pubblico). Ma ad esempio se nel CCNL hai un aumento di 20 euro, te li tolgono dall'assorbibile e tu non vedi più soldi. 

Gli scatti di anzianità non sono riassorbibili. Gli aumenti del CCNL ovviamente sì, sei fuori dalla contrattazione collettiva nazionale (che considero comunque un idiozia, ma questo e un altro discorso). Basta saperlo. I ""premi di produzione"" qui dove sono vengono anche essi contrattati individualmente, quindi se non vogliono d'armi i soldi non hanno bisogno di questi squallidi mezzi.

Now, these are the facts, and none of this is illegal from Cavaco's standpoint. Oliveira Costa, however, has been proved to have benefited some of his closest friends in the process, most of them closely associated with PSD. Meanwhile, Cavaco has routinely refused to explain these transactions, ceaselessly evoking his own untainted character as some sort of self-justifying argument. In a case full of influence peddling with known political implications, the heavy clouds of lingering doubts that this attitude has left hanging over his head seem pretty undeniable to me.

Ich hab schon auh mal gegoogelt, ihre Master-Arbeit zu dem Thema ist mir auch aufgefallen, allerdings habe ich die nicht zu lesen bekommen. Ist dir da ein Link in die Hände gefallen?

Was ich meine ist: Sie hat da zwei Wissenschaftler befragt, die von vorne herein der gleichen Meinung sind, und sich von denen aufs Blatt diktieren lassen. Sie hätte 'nen Soziologen und nen Psychologen fragen können, die da anderer Meinung sind, das beides gegeneinander abwiegen und selber neutral bleiben, das wäre Journalismus gewesen. Ungeprüft deswegen, weil sie den Psychologen ja nicht zu den Einlassungen der Frau Thöne befragt hat. Der redet über was ähnliches, aber „prüft“ ihrs ja nicht.

Sie hat irgendwo eine ausgegaben, die ne Geschichte erzählt hat. Als erstes hatte ich daran kritisiert, daß der Teil für das Thema möglicherweise irrelevant wäre, ist er nun nicht. Trotzdem wäre es ja kein Problem, mal „Herrn Pütz“ zu fragen, ob er der Meinung ist, daß das das typische Vehalten eines PUA oder ein Extremfall ist — Überhaupt, „Herr Pütz“ darf keine Stellung nehmen zu dem, was die anderen Beiden sagen.

Es macht so insgesamt den Eindruck, als hätte die Autorin sich gedacht: Ich will gern nen Artikel gegen PUAs schreiben, meine Meinung ist soundso, und jetzt such ich mir ein paar Zitate von Leuten, die das bestätigen.

Du fragst dich, warum Herr Pütz nicht mal eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit über das Thema schreibt. Ich frage mich, inwiefern das Thema  überhaupt relevant für die Wissenschaft ist. Es ist ein Gemenge aus wilden Behauptungen, einem Jargon (beides inhaltlich uninteressant für Wissenschaftler, ich würde wirklich gerne Wissen, was Frau Thöne darüber intessantes schreiben will) und NLP, über das es schon X Arbeiten gibt.

&gt;unmenschlich

Das erste, was man vom Artikel sieht, ist das Bild einer Armee von Vampiren — zumindest interpretere ich das so. Dann lese ich da noch

* Er hat keine Persönlichkeit mehr
* Zähmen, unterwerfen, gefügig machen
* müsse er sich „genau so archaisch verhalten, wie es ihr Großvater getan hat
* manipulierenden, frauenverachtenden A*******h
* dass bei den Steinzeitmenschen derjenige Jäger die Frau erobert hat, der das größte Wild erlegt hat
* Gehabe

Ob das alles unmenschlich ist, darüber können wir diskutieren, aber da wird eindeutig mit Feindbildern hantiert, es ist extrem wertend, und hört sich teilweise an, wie eine Reportage über ein Naturvolk aus Südamerika, da ändern auch ein paar sugar lumps von Herrn Baranowski nichts.

&gt; Mich dünkt der Autor des kritischen Kommentars steht der PUA-Szene nahe, besucht er doch eine Seite namens Reddit auf dem sich bekannterweise auch viele PUAs tummeln ;)

The issue though is that if you share a currency, you'll need a system of internal transfers to automatically balance out discrepancies between regions. This is almost always solved via taxation and a federal authority sending highway funding, education funding, health care funding, etc to poorer regions. If the transfers are not present (note: bailouts aren't the same as transfers) then certain regions will become very unequal in times of crisis and the spreads on bonds will rise significantly.

&gt;http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2011/03/02/black-911-a-walk-on-the-dark-side-2/

&gt;&gt;One consultant, Jonathan Winer, told ABC: “it’s absolutely unprecedented to see cases of insider trading covering the entire world from Japan to the US to North America to Europe.”[1] The list of affected nations was long, and included the US, Germany, Japan, France Luxembourg, Hong Kong, the UK, Switzerland and Spain.[2] Soon, independent investigations were underway on three continents in the belief that the paper trail would lead to the terrorists.
 
&gt;&gt;Press statements by leading figures in the international banking community left little doubt that the evidence was compelling. Ernst Welteke, President of the German Deutsche Bundesbank, told reporters that “a preliminary review by German regulators and bank researchers showed there were highly suspicious sales of shares in airlines and insurance companies, along with major trades in gold and oil markets, before September 11 that suggest….advance knowledge of the attacks. Welteke said that his researchers came across….almost irrefutable proof of insider trading.”  Welteke was blunt: “What we found makes us sure that people connected to the terrorists must have been trying to profit from this tragedy.”[3]

&gt;So the insider trading was very obvious in the early days after the attack. Everyone seemed gung-ho to track down these traders as it would lead directly to the terrorists.

&gt;http://www.wanttoknow.info/011218reuters

&gt;&gt;Using a pioneering laser scanning technology to find data on damaged computer hard drives and main frames found in the rubble of the World Trade Center and other nearby collapsed buildings, Convar has recovered information from 32 computers that support assumptions of dirty doomsday dealings. 

&gt;&gt;""The suspicion is that inside information about the attack was used to send financial transaction commands and authorizations in the belief that amid all the chaos the criminals would have, at the very least, a good head start,"" said Convar director Peter Henschel. 


&gt;&gt;They were even able to recover hundreds of harddrives from the rubble and were able to recover almost all of the data held on them.


&gt;&gt;""It could turn out that Americans went on an absolute shopping binge on that Tuesday morning. But at this point there are many transactions that cannot be accounted for,'' Henschel said.""


&gt;&gt;""Not only the volume but the size of the transactions was far higher than usual for a day like that. There is a suspicion that these were possibly planned to take advantage of the chaos.'' 


&gt;&gt;""There is a suspicion that some people had advance knowledge of the approximate time of the plane crashes in order to move out amounts exceeding $100 million,'' Wagner said. ""They thought that the records of their transactions could not be traced after the main frames were destroyed.'' 


&gt;After some time all mention of this investigation seemed to disappear and people started wondering what the SEC had found.

&gt;&gt;In his book “Crossing the Rubicon”, former LAPD detective Mike Ruppert explains the SEC’s unprecedented move to deputize:
 
&gt;&gt;What happens when you deputize someone in a national security or criminal investigation is that you make it illegal for them to disclose publicly what they know…. In effect, they become government agents and are controlled by government regulations rather than their own conscience. In fact, they can be thrown in jail without a hearing if they talk publicly. I have seen this implied threat time and again with federal investigations, intelligence agents, and even members of the United States Congress who are bound so tightly by secrecy oaths and agreements that they are not even able to disclose criminal activities inside the government for fear of incarceration.[13]
 
&gt;&gt;Notice, this surely means that Al Qaeda had nothing to do with the insider trading.[14] When the evidentiary trail led back to Wall Street, the SEC moved quickly to control the evidence and muzzle potential witnesses. Despite the best efforts of the SEC, a few details did leak to the world press. In mid-October 2001, The Independent (UK) reported that, “To the embarrassment of investigators, it has….emerged that the firm used to buy many of the ‘put’ options (where a trader, in effect, bets on a share price fall) on United Airlines stock was headed until 1998 by Alvin ‘Buzzy’ Krongard, now executive director of the CIA.”[15]

&gt;Well it turns out that when the SEC found direct connections between the firms involved in the trading and the CIA they moved to make everything secret. 


&gt;&gt;The evidence was all the more incriminating, because in at least one case the purchaser failed to collect a reported $2.5 million in profits made from the collapsing share price of UAL stock. The only plausible explanation was that someone at the purchasing bank feared exposure and subsequent arrest.


&gt;&gt;http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/06/sec-government-destroyed-documents-regarding-pre-911-put-options.html

&gt;&gt;So after the trail seemingly goes cold David Callahan submits a FOIA request to find out what the SEC had discovered.

&gt;&gt;We have been advised that the potentially responsive records have been destroyed.
 
&gt;&gt;If the SEC had responded by producing documents showing that the pre-9/11 put options had an innocent explanation (such as a hedge made by a smaller airline), that would be understandable.
 
&gt;&gt;If the SEC had responded by saying that the documents were classified as somehow protecting proprietary financial information, I wouldn’t like it, but I would at least understand the argument.
 
&gt;&gt;But destroyed? Why?


&gt;The documents were destroyed.

Your defenition on the other hand broadens terrorism to include (among milions of other things): The US, Glorious and French revolutions. The independence wars fought in almost every country (recent examples: South Sudan, Timor Leste). Every civil war in the history of mankind. The Roman Empire, The barbarian invasions of the Roman Empire. And even Jesus kicking people out of the temple (It's been a while, but I'm sure he knocked over a fruit stand somewhere.) 

While I am more than happy to discuss this further I suspect your only motive here is to argue with people on the internet. If that is the case, don't bother replying.

Ceci dit, les encyclopédies ont évolué depuis 15 ans. Certaines sont plus spécialisées (là où WP est *généraliste*), d'autres sont ouvertement biaisées (là où WP se veut *neutre*).

Second of all, it seems a little baffling that in a thread about a country that suffered for half a century under communism you proclaim that communism is the most progressive form of government. More than baffling, actually, it's almost like you have no historical or cultural context at all, or you do and are being sardonic or facetious - hence I wasn't sure if you were being serious or not.

I'm not sure where you're from or how old you are, but if you're seriously claiming that 'communism is the most progressive' I can safely assume that your cultural context is very removed from modern Romania. 'Progressive' means forward-moving. In all parts of Eastern Europe this is a move away from the corrupt systems of government that have stymied progress since '89. Communists don't have progressive policies, they have conservative ones. They want to keep things the same as they ever were, keeping public money funneling into the pockets of the political class, a class that you may not be as familiar with if you are from the states - essentially criminal oligarchs. 

I find it really strange that anyone thinks that 'progressive' is an absolute that can be maximized, or that there are universal right/left dichotomies in politics.

false,LordGravewish,PORT,Portugal,"The important question for the 2015 legislative elections isn't who will win, since there's very little chance it won't be PS. The two main parties tend to switch power every few mandates, but without an absolute majority the winning party will need to build a coalition to be able to do anything, considering the unstable economic situation here. It was already unlikely that PS would manage to get an absolute majority in parliament, and now even more so.

PS is a center-left party, so obvious coalition partners would be either of the center-right parties, but it would most likely be considered a betrayal to their constituency to build a coalition with any of the two current parties in power as they currently stand strongly against the current government (the current government is a coalition between CDS-PP and PSD, the only center-right parties in parliament). This leaves them (assuming no new party gets into parliament) BE and PCP (CDU), both extreme left (the latter is actually the communist party) and I can't for the life of me see those parties participate in a government without being the majority partner.

Regardless, I find it increasingly likely that we'll welcome a new party into parliament, especially with BE increasingly losing votes to other parties. They've recently started trying to play the role of PCP, and there isn't that much reason to vote for them when you can vote for the ""real thing"" (PCP). Even better, they recently kicked out most of their moderate left members.

""Livre"" for example is a party founded by those moderate left ex-members of BE, and they made a very good showing in the European Parliament Elections. Surprisingly, they would have managed to elect multiple members of parliament if that had actually been a legislative election, getting over 5% of the vote in multiple parts of the country (the capital, Lisbon, being one of them). I could actually see a coalition between them, though I don't think they'd accept to be part of a coalition without getting something quite considerable in return. If they don't demand much, they risk alienating their voters when they don't keep many of their campaign promises, possibly even getting kicked out of parliament during the following legislative elections due to lack of votes. I don't believe PS will be willing to accept enough of their demands, but I wouldn't completely dismiss such a possibility. Though, if they do, I wouldn't be surprised for the coalition to dissolve quite quickly due to later disagreements between both parties, especially after their coalition government is faced with a couple tough decisions. **[Edited to make my point clearer, in response to [a reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2n2l8a/former_portuguese_pm_socrates_arrested_in_tax_case/cma5fb7)]**

This means that starting from the next elections, it's very likely we'll have a relative majority government or an unstable coalition, both probably the worst possible things that could happen now as such a government would basically be powerless when faced with any tough decision.

Either way, I'm still not voting either PS or PSD/CDS, as I feel those parties don't represent us and am tired of them taking turns on who gets to steal next. I'm also not going to vote BE or PCP as they spout populist bullshit whenever possible, and then don't seem to do anything very useful with the rest of their time. I'm left with voting for a party without current parliamentary representation.

I'm sorry but this is ridiculous and I must ask that you back up this rather incendiary statement with a reputable source.

While I am not schizophrenic I have a friend that is, and I showed him this comment of yours. He speaks native English and reasonably good Spanish as well as some German and Dutch, and he's also very informed regarding his condition. He did a combination of laughter and ""WTF"" when he saw the claims you made... soooo, yeah.

If anything schizophrenia makes language learning harder, not easier, and the idea that the more languages you learn is somehow directly associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia is also not true.

I'd like to see some of these ""scientists argue"" sources. Here are some sources that actively seek to disprove what you claim (generously provided by my friend).

What I am more impressed with is how orderly people actually are when parking outside of an actual bike rack. This is most evident when people essentially just continue the row formed by the bike rack, but even other places, rows will naturally form.

And when someone tips over a bike when getting their own bike (since this WILL happen, especially because so many buy bikes with awfully small support legs and don't know how to angle their front weal to keep balance), people usually lift them back up.

2. Ich hab mir das schon heute mittag überflogen.

Schau mal, die Sache ist doch ganz einfach.

Es ist ja tatsächlich eine plausible ökonomische Vermutung nach 9/11 die Märkte auf Insider-Trading zu untersuchen. Insidertrading von Terroristen zur Terrorfinanzierung wohlgemerkt. Da haben wir jetzt also Raum eine Verschwörungstheorie zu postulieren und aufzumachen.

So,das ist jetzt in sehr vielen Ländern geschehen, im 9/11 Commission Report steht was dazu, im BaWe Report steht was drin, wunderbar. Man konnte Anomalien feststellen, die dann unergiebig waren. Auf der ganzen Welt konnte anscheinend niemand Insidertrading nachweisen, case closed. Wo ist also dein Problem? Die Verschwörungstheorie des Insider-Tradings wurde untersucht und verworfen. Das gehört zu Theorien dazu, dass sie auch mal widerlegt werden, kennste.

Jetzt kommt irgendein VT-Blog und behauptet die Daten der SEC zum Insider-Trading wären laut einem FOIA vernichtet worden. Und leitet daraus eine Verschwörung ab, was an sich schonmal nicht undebingt logisch ist. 

Noch bezeichnender ist aber, dass hier kein einziger Beweis, nichtmal Beleg für die angebliche Löschung aufgebracht wird. Kein Scan des Dokuments, nichts, absolut rein gar nichts: Das steht einfach da und Ende.  Der Link bei Washingtonblog auf die hompage von einem gewissen Max Keiser -anscheinend ein bekannter RT Kollaborateur- funtioniert nicht. Hab den Bildlink gegoogled und [dieses Bild (das erste)](http://fightingforliberty.ning.com/m/blogpost?id=2881777%3ABlogPost%3A36969) gefunden, welches schonmal absolut amateurhaft gefälscht aussieht. Sieht aus wie ein erstelltes pdf, aber FOIA responses sind Briefe, es müsste also natürlich ein Scan sein. Man findet auch nirgends einen originalen Beitrag des originalen Antragsstellers, der hier als ein gewisser David Callahan von SmartCEO genannt wird. Ich hab jetzt eine Stunde gegoogled und keine originalen Dokumente und Beweise gefunden, ich darf daher davon ausgehen, dass einfach gar keine Beweise existieren und mal wieder [pure Dummschwallerei und Erfindung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWdD206eSv0) is?

Aber zurück zum Thema:

Mein verlinkter Artikel (Den Ich eben beim Threadlesen übrigens -natürlich- am bottom deines /r/conspiracy Links gefunden hab, hättest du dir ja dann schon geben können) aus dieser Skeptikerseite gibt doch ein klares, neutrales und seriöses Statement ab. Er verlinkt doch sogar brav auf verschiedene Meinungen, Studien und Artikel und kommt dann zum abgewägten, irgendwie versöhnlichen, sowohl strikt skeptischen als auch strikt logischen Fazit:

&gt;We cannot prove that the pre-9/11 put options weren't made with foreknowledge of the attacks. And we suspect not even those who instigated the trades could do that. We now know that Steve Sarnoff was the author of the 9/9 newsletter recommending the purchase of American Airline put options, for example. The institutional investor is yet to be named, but even if they were, and they explained in detail their reasons for that decision, that will never constitute solid proof of anything. And so those who want to believe something else will continue to claim that maybe they had received a tip-off from elsewhere.

&gt;What we can show, however, is that the usual discussion of these issues leaves out a considerable amount of relevant detail.

&gt;Books like ""The Hidden History of 9/11"" claim the 9/11 Commission footnote was their only word on the topic, for instance, ignoring the details provided in the Terrorist Finance monograph we've quoted.

&gt;We've not seen anyone even begin to fully address the economic circumstances of the time, including the general fall in share prices in the weeks before 9/11, and the bad news that specifically related to United and American Airlines.

&gt;The significance of the put options volumes appears to be exaggerated. Previous spikes are rarely even mentioned. And while high level conspirators might be able to cover up investigations in the US, we've yet to see any explanation of why inquiries in other countries revealed nothing, despite dramatic headlines when the stories first appeared.

&gt;In short, we believe there are explanations for the put options, other than 9/11 foreknowledge: it's just that you're not being told what they are.

So, und damit is das Thema für mich beendet. Ich werd hier nicht mehr Zeit investieren, du siehst es kommt eh nichts dabei raus.

But on the other hand, they made a contract that binds them (whoever is behind the construction and delivery of said marshmellow ships) to deliver the ships to Russia. 

So it's a lose-lose situation really, since if they go the ""moral"" way which is not to sell the ships to the eastern bully, they would show that their word is only binding when they feel like honouring it.

The Eurozone -- majority of EU GDP and members -- have been  experiencing a recession since 2008; double, potentially triple, dip recession mind you as fears over deflation now loom -- inflation was 0.4% in Oct 2014. Leaving the EU, and therefore the Common Market and Eurozone, would leave countries with debts in a currency they no longer use -- or anyone for that matter.

--

To avoid the complex economics, and put it simply, Europe would descend into a 'Dark-Age-esque' time for ***decades.*** Meaning they'd lose any competitive advantage they have currently to competitors, and sometimes 'enemies'. You'd see people starve, the United States would have to come in with another 'Marshall Plan' -- only much larger -- and refugees would flee the region. People underestimate just how interconnected both fiscally and politically the European Union is. As *Jean Monnet* predicated the powers ceded to the union have cast a net beyond the ability of states to subside from. 

--

And no, I'm not joking. Whether you like the European Union or not the aforementioned points are of fact not opinion. You can support the European Union and realize this, or hate it and realize this. Be wary of any fool who'd advocate leaving the Union as the results would be nothing less than ruinous. Any 'sensible' strategy toward dissolution would take as long as it has taken to form, if not longer. And when taken with the considerations of positive direct effects and externalities the choice to support the European Union is plain.

*""A handful of countries in Europe have set the highest recognition of the importance of protection of sources by including it as a constitutional right. The most significant protections are found in Sweden. Under the Freedom of the Press Act, anyone who is a source has a fundamental right to anonymity and it is prohibited as a criminal offense for journalists to break this duty of confidentiality. Officials are prohibited from investigating unless it is specifically authorized by the Act. Liability is lodged in the editor rather than the journalist or other employees. The identities of sources are strongly protected from being disclosed except in limited circumstances such as breach of national security. This principle of anonymity was first recognized in the original 1766 freedom of the press law and has existed in Swedish law since. The Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression, another constitutional instrument, extends the rights to radio, television and other technologies.""* ^[PDF](https://wikileaks.org/w/images/c/c0/Silencingsources.pdf)

Den Rest des Films geht es um ihre Unterhaltungen in den Wiener Straßen. Obwohl sie fast fremde sind, sprechen sie sehr ernst über das Leben, die Liebe und so etwas - und natürlich werden sie sich verlieben.

Bin mir nicht sicher obs da Studien solcher Bilanzierungen gibt, aber ich würde vom Bauchgefühl sagen, dass Elektroautos minimal umweltfreundlicher sind - zumindest im Moment noch.

false,ro4ers,LATV,"Latvia, but living in NL","I think noting bias is important, especially in articles where there is an attempt to keep it disguised. While one article written with an un-truthful pro-Russia bias isn't going to change the minds of many people it is going to plant a seed of doubt which can be exploited later by more aggressive methods. 

As for your other points I couldn't disagree more. I applaud the fact that the western world has accepted a value system in which the life of an individual is cherished and his right to choose, his right to individualism is deemed important and where the law protects the individual not the state. It has basically become one of the pillars supporting the western civilization and way of life. The people of Europe have brought a lot of death and suffering upon each other through the centuries in order to reach a point of understanding such as this and it should not be brushed aside for a bunch of Euros.

To simply dismiss actions as brazen, provocative and counter to our perceived values as to what Russia is doing right on the border of the EU (to a country whose people want to accept these values nonetheless) in exchange for extending the status quo going a wee bit longer would be disastrous to that effect.

Firstly it would contribute to dividing Europe once more due to a loss of trust between the different people and put the pinnacle of European cultural co-habitation, the EU on shaky ground.
I can guarantee you that appeasement of Russia by western European leaders in the current situation would have been viewed as a massive betrayal of the values ex-Warsaw pact countries strove and in many cases still strive for, a betrayal of the ideal of the ""west"" they held back in the late 80’s and early 90’s when they regained their independence. The very lame response to Georgia in 2008 already served as a wedge to widen the distrust between the people of “old Europe” and “new Europe” in many post-Communist European countries, most notably Poland and the Baltic countries. 

Secondly any appeasement would be perceived by Russia as an act of weakness and would be duly exploited by anyone that would see any gain to be had. There are already many that see us as having no spine and willing to bend over in exchange for some money. All cultural aspects aside this is a very dangerous position to be in as it opens the door for a more aggressive approach in any sort of future contact.

Furthermore I don’t think the way we interact with China can be taken as an example to the way we interact with Russia for a myriad of reasons, chief among them being the differences in geographical position, cultural attributes as well as the different trends the countries have been following.  

Personally for me Putins proposed “new world order” is completely unacceptable. An order that contains a small number of equally large actors that have their own spheres of interest and are free to act inside them as they see fit in order to guarantee stability in their “realms”. It’s the “perfect” order created by a limited number of men in power that believe they are magnitudes superior to anyone and in which everyone else is a tool, an expendable piece of material in order to achieve a greater good.

false,Bosco89,veneto,null,"Secondo me nel quadro descritto mancano due considerazioni, l'effetto/danno istantaneo sulla persona e sulla collettività e il radicamento socio-culturale.

L'alcool è radicato da un'eternità, ed esistono una varietà di prodotti a base di alcool che fanno una larghissima fetta dell'economia dei paesi occidentali. Bandirlo significherebbe far chiudere un'enormità di imprese, spingere molte persone al contrabbando e perdere un pezzo enorme di storia tra vino, birra e liquori. L'alcool però ha effetti a breve termine anche piuttosto pesanti su chi lo usa, e infatti ci sono varie restrizioni sulla vendita e sul consumo quando si svolgono certe attività come guidare.

Il tabacco ha un certo background culturale, ma non al livello dell'alcool in occidente. Ha effetti a lungo termine che coinvolgono anche i tuoi vicini con il fumo passivo e ha le sue opportune restrizioni, ma oltre a questo gli effetti psicoattivi a breve termine sono ridicoli in confronto alle droghe del grafico. Fumare tabacco regolarmente è più che altro una dipendenza solamente autolesionista con effetti gravi solo a lunghissimo termine, e lo stato si rifà dei costi con le tasse sul tabacco. 
Alcuni stati, pur non decidendo di bandirlo completamente (anche qui per ragioni economiche, multinazionali del fumo ma anche i singoli tabaccai), attuano delle tasse molto forti come deterrente (vedi i circa 15€ a pacchetto dell'Australia, oltre alle cose a contorno come non esporre i pacchetti in vetrine e regolamentare il look della confezione, che potrebbero dare una mano a dare un pelo di stigma sociale).

Le altre droghe ""comuni"" non hanno gran parte di questi pregi:

* non sono radicate nella società (la marijuana potrebbe essere l'unica eccezione)
* possono causare grossi danni a se stessi anche istantaneamente, o creare dipendenze perlomeno piuttosto serie (anche qui la maria potrebbe essere un'eccezione)
* hanno effetti psicoattivi piuttosto consistenti, il che in alcuni casi può portare a fare cose irresponsabili che non faresti se tu fossi pienamente cosciente (tipo metterti alla guida in uno stato psicofisico inaccettabile).

(my two cents, non sono un esperto di droghe e preferisco non esserlo)

L'ultimo punto secondo me è il fulcro della questione legalizzazione, non tanto il danno che una sostanza può causare al suo utilizzatore quanto gli effetti indiretti sulla collettività che invece non ne fa uso. Se lo stato si impegna a far rispettare le sue leggi, viene da sé che la legalizzazione di una sostanza che ha come effetto una deresponsabilizzazione dell'individuo diventa un controsenso. Anche nei paesi bassi [non è totalmente legale la vendita e il consumo nemmeno di marijuana](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politica_dei_Paesi_Bassi_in_materia_di_stupefacenti), ma è autorizzata solo in un contesto ben preciso e controllato al fine di ordine sociale e di impedire l'accesso alle cosiddette droghe pesanti. 

In conclusione penso che non si possa limitare a vedere la droga come un modo per ""staccarsi"" da se stessi e dal resto del mondo, perché in realtà anche e specialmente sotto l'effetto di droghe stiamo influendo su noi stessi e su ciò che ci circonda (e spesso negativamente, se non si sta molto attenti).

What you are probably thinking about are the Chinese languages who are mostly isolating meaning they just use little words where other language grammatically express certain concepts but Japanese is not one of them. In fact, Japanese is very much a language that grammatically expresses stuff. 

For once, Japanese has a very large particle system that makes the German case system look like Kindergarten. That also included such foreign concepts like marking topic which is unheard of in German or any IE language. That also makes Japanese highly nonconfigurational.which means that sentence structure is largely irrelevant. Combine that with the fact that Japanese people drop everything that is obvious, you've got quite a lot to keep track of. For once the particles to the nouns and then you have to fill in the gaps with context. 

Polite requests, expressing if something may or may not be allowed and a lot of other things are expressed with the *-te* form and another suffix to the verb in *-te* form. Adjectives conjugate according to time. There are probably more than a hundred counters that make it even hard to just simply say numbers because of those numbers count something (and just think about how often you answer questions just by saying numbers. ""How many minutes was the train delayed?"" ""20"". Better know the counter for intervals because otherwise the Japanese will just say ""二十。。。何？"").

Japanese grammar is straight forward and more regular than many other languages. But ""grammar is pretty much non-existent"" is a stupid thing to say. It's also a stupid thing to suggest that Japanese is easier than German for an Arabic speaker who's fluent in English and had French in school.

false,SorinCiprian,ROMA,Romania,"Moldova's economy is growing extremely fast. Their GDP grew by 8% last year and it's expected to grow by approximately 4.5% each year in the following years. If you consider the fact that Russia has been by far their main trading partner and that lots of their products have been embargoed by Russia recently, it's quite surprising that they have such a good growth. The reason the growth trend in Moldova is still going strong is because Romania is now importing much more from Moldova than it used to. Romania is set to become Moldova's main trading partner in the following year/s. 

Moldova is a very small country and doesn't have all the resources necessary to function properly on their own, so they rely heavily on other countries. Up until now, the country they relied on the most was Russia. With recent events (Moldova's decision to head towards the west), Russia has been tightening the belt on them and they started to look towards Romania. Moldova and Romania have been getting closer and closer together in the last years - which is awesome. 


Evidently, all I've mentioned so far has been great - strong growth, the push towards the EU and the improvement of Romanian-Moldovan cooperation (and at the same time giving up the crippling relations with Russia). Unfortunately, it will still be a good amount of time until Moldova will get itself out of the deep hole they've dug themselves in for the past 25 years. It must be mentioned though that they've had no choice in the matter. As I've said, they couldn't head west right after the revolution like Romania or other soviet block countries did because they were reliant on Russia and Romania wasn't capable of taking the task on itself at the time. 

To answer your question (because I realized I haven't done so), Romania's growth rates are among the biggest in Europe - so our economy is doing well enough, but it's going to take a long amount of time until we catch up to the western part of the continent. Moldova is growing even faster, but, again, it's going to take a long amount of time until they catch up to Romania.

So can German cases once you understood them.

&gt; Try to explain the use of ""doch"" to someone learning German. glhf

""Doch"" is either a discourse particle or a positive answer to a negative question. Discourse particles in Japanese are sentence final よ and ね which are as hard to explain as ""doch"" as a discourse particle if you want to cover all uses. 

&gt; I don't understand why people make such a big fuss about は and が. It's not difficult in any way.

It's still a foreign concept you've got to get used to. Once you got over the arbitrariness of gender or dealing with cases, they're not hard to understand either.

&gt; Counters are not grammar. There are also counters in German.

Everything is grammar. And they become important as soon as native speaker have problems if you leave them out. It doesn't matter if I say ""20"" or ""20 Minuten"". It does matter to a Japanese native speaker, though.

&gt;  basic grammar

Who cares about basic grammar.

&gt; No plural

well known concept to Arabic native speakers. Therefore, irrelevant.

&gt; no future tense

Japanese has a future tense it's just not morphologically marked (it isn't in German either, by the way). You indicate future with other words.

**Present tense:** ""Ich gehe zur Uni"" 「私は大学に行きます。」  
**Future tense:** ""Morgen gehe ich zur Uni"" 「明日、私は大学に行きます。」

&gt; no person

If you learn regular conjugation tables, you're doing it wrong anyway. Also, familiar concept to OP so doesn't matter anyway.

&gt; no genders

The only people making a fuss about gender are beginners. Also, Arabic has gender as well so, again, a familiar concept to OP and probably something he can easily deal with.

&gt; six tenses

Three. Past, present, future. The rest are aspects which exists in Japanese (*-te* form as a continuous aspect, for example).

&gt; three persons (six with plural)

Three. singular and plural are number.

&gt; and the bitch that is called Konjunktiv.

""Würde""-Ersatzform is enough for any student. 

You're making an absolute statement about something that can not be put into an absolute statement. Difficulty in language is **never** absolute because you never look at in in an unbias fashion. For OP, German is easier than Japanese. By far. Including grammar. Because he already speaks English and had some French lessons and speaks Arabic natively which takes the edge off of the glottal stop and the [x].

Not even talking about the fact that ""apart from the bloody writing system that you need to know to not look like a fucking idiot to every native speaker as well is almost all the vocabulary that is not rooted in anything you have ever seen before, the language is really easy"" is a pretty irrelevant statement anyway.

I'm against the former, the oppression of someone's religious beliefs.

&gt; Your talking like that's somehow evil or oppressive towards people of other beliefs if the early Christians incorporated details of their religions.

I dunno, I always assumed they did it to force out other beliefs. But now that I think about it, there's nothing wrong with it really, and I'd be inconsistent if I thought that was bad.

No, I'm just saying Christians have been bigoted in the past.

Because I *don't* see creating a secular holiday to fill in for a religious one, Christmas especially, as a bad thing. Describing that as a 'heinous crime' seems silly to me, given that the whole idea of replacing an existing religious holiday with a new one has been done before by religions, and indeed many religions do it (it's no fun being part of &lt;X religion&gt; if you can't have fun like everyone can in &lt;Y religion&gt; in &lt;festival&gt;).

false,Gehalgod,advanced-other,DE--&gt;EN Translation Student,"""Erneut"" is actually the participle of ""erneuen"", which is a rare synonym of ""erneuern"", meaning ""to renew"". So, yes, ""erneut"" means ""renewed"" as opposed to simply ""neu"" as in ""not old"".

Just like in English (""since"" and ""because""), ""da"" and ""weil"" differ slightly in that ""da"" normally introduces a previously known idea, whereas ""weil"" introduces a new fact.

I also believe that in English, ""because"" tends to mean that the fact expressed in the clause is a direct cause, while ""since"" sort of implies circumstances which allow something to happen but not a direct cause necessarily. If I'm not mistaken, the same applies to ""da"" and ""weil"" in that ""weil"" implies more of a direct cause.

That would make it even easier considering German is literally in the top 10 of easiest languages to learn for native speakers only topped by Frisian, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish and Danish.

&gt; But it does matter if you say ""ein"", ""eins"", ""eintel"", ""erste"" or ""erstens"". Those are counters.

No. ""ein"" is a number. That number just agrees with gender which is not hard to understand. ""eins"" is also just a number. ""eintel"" is a fraction. Those exist in Japanese as well because otherwise, Japanese people couldn't talk about mathematics. ""erste"" and ""erstens"" are ordinal numbers. 

In Japanese, ""one hour"" would translate to 一時間.

一 *ichi* **one**  
時 *ji* **hour**  
間 *kan* **counter for intervals. Literally no meaning other than ""what I just said describes an interval""**

If you wanted to say ""first hour"", you'd say 一時間目 where 目 just indicates that the number *X* you just mentioned is on the *Xth* position in a series (therefore, an ordinal number).

The counters are also sometimes called classifiers.

&gt; Are we comparing Japanese and Arabic now?

No. We are comparing German to OPs native language and other languages he speaks. There is no ""hardest language"". Therefore, comparing any language to another without taking the native language of the OP and other languages spoken by OP into consideration is literally pointless.

Driving in general is quite aggressive in the UK, and van drivers tend to be more aggressive than most (presumably they don't give a shit because they only drive the van as part of their job). Most vans are white, and typically these men have shaved heads and stickers of the flag on the van. At least, this is true in London, and British media are made in London. It was remarkable because before Thatcher working class meant trade unionist. It's a stereotype like ""soccer mum"" in the US, but a lot of people with darker skin would feel uncomfortable, say, going into a pub with a lot of St George's flags hanging outside the window (unless it was the World Cup).

Nowadays WVM are more likely to be UKIPpers, and one of the reasons UKIP is growing is because mainstream parties are felt to be out of touch. So for an MP to make a thing of a WVM's house can only give the Tories an excuse to distract people from their own thrashing in the election, by saying one or all of :

* she is not familiar with WVM's houses? well she's out of touch with *real* working class people
* she looks down on healthy patriotism
* she looks down on UKIPpers, because of the superiority complex of the liberal, educated classes

false,Asyx,native,native,"&gt; Yea and 90% of Japanese's difficulty comes from the kanji, not from the grammar, which was my point.

But the other 10% are still harder for him than German. I know that we like to pat ourself on the back and say ""oh look how hard our language is"". That's also the reason why people get angry at the new orthography. But German is easy for everybody fluent in English. native English speakers only struggle because it's their first foreign language most of the time and once they got past the genders and cases (which are usually the first things you learn), they're all saying that German is an easy language with very little surprises.

It takes time to get used to produce Japanese. It takes time to get used to just accepting the particles and the loose sentence structure. It takes time to get used to relative clauses in Japanese. It takes time to get used to using a sentence final particle instead of ""because"". That's all already done for him in German because English and German are so close. There is a fundamental difference people of non-configurational languages think about their languages. If a linguist is in the field and tries to record such a language, the biggest mistake they can make is not having their recording device on them at all times because it can easily happen that somebody says something and you're like ""what? That was a weird sentence structure"" then they get their recorder and ask the person to repeat the sentence and the sentence structure is completely different and they can't reproduce the sentence in the same way they did just a few minutes ago. In the same way most Germans don't waste a second thought on the fact that Mädchen is neutral, those people don't give a damn about the sentence structure. And it takes time to think similarly to that as well. On paper, Japanese seems easy. But actually becoming fluent like that is a whole different story. And the barrier for that is everywhere in Japanese because it's completely unrelated to everything you, me or OP speaks. You're probably fine with reading Japanese once you got it. But producing and using the loose sentence structure for emphasis is not nearly as easy.

And I didn't ""disregard your example as ordinals"". I said that your example are not counters but ordinals and then told you how to build ordinals in Japanese and hoped that this makes it obvious that the counter is the difference here. *me* is not a counter. It just marks ordinals.

The difference is that you can't count people in Japanese like in German. You can just count people in German by saying ""eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf"". You've got to say ""一人、二人、三人、四人、五人"" in Japanese. 

I know that Japanese is not as difficult as people like to say it is. Similar to Chinese, that's mostly just people trying to keep the prestige value up so people treat them like geniuses. But I can assure you that OP will not be able to learn Japanese faster than German. Even if he stays away from Kanji (which is not a very clever thing to do).

I'm not trying to piss you off here. If I wanted to do that, I'd have posted your ""Japanese has no grammar"" comment to /r/badlinguistics. I just can't understand how anybody who speaks German and at least a tiny bit of Japanese (and I just suppose that your Japanese skills are better than just a ""tiny bit"") can say that Japanese is easier than German for an English speaker (even if it's just a fluent non-native).",0,1416711744,null,0,false,0,cmac0cl,t3_2n2o90,t1_cmac0cl,t1_cmabjgv,null,1425888131,2,false,German,t5_2qq51,2

If you're doing pre-med or or a science bachelors I doubt a foreign language is required for your degree, but it might be beneficial for you to take the classes as electives. In doing so you will start learning French way above just the basics (so long as you apply yourself), and the department will more than likely have resources that would be beneficial for you if you desire to live/study in France. 

Another option is to strike out on your own and attend a language institute  or find work as a teaching assistant. [The French Embassy program](http://highereducation.frenchculture.org/teach-in-france) might be a good fit for a gap year or if you decide to take a few semesters off.

I was proficient enough to have normal conversations with people, and the courses in French were manageable.

http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/timothy-snyder-spricht-ueber-die-ukraine-13144316.html

Die erste Seite ein Lobgesang auf den Historiker, der hoch angesehen und gelehrt ist, aber dabei bescheiden und selbstlos, nur auf das Wohl und die Freiheit der anderen bedacht (über eventuelle Werke, Studien oder dergleichen erfährt man aber nichts). 

Danach hört man aus diesem berufenen Munde, dass es nicht wie sonst in historischen Kontexten eine Reihe von sich gegenseitig widerstrebenden und überkreuzenden Interessen sind, die schließlich zum Konflikt geführt haben. Stattdessen gibt es diesmal nur einen einzigen Akteur: Wladimir Putin, den Feind! (Illustration mit verspiegelter Sonnenbrille gleich dabei. Da sieht man schon, wie böse der ist).

Auf der anderen Seite: die Ukraine als kollektiver Volkswille ohne Standes- und Klassenschranken und mit dem Drang zu Freiheit und Demokratie. 

Schließlich: nur wer die Propaganda (natürlich der Gegenseite) durchschaut, wird gewahr: es gibt nur eine Entscheidung zwischen ""richtig"" oder ""falsch"".

Auf welcher Seite willst Du stehen, /u/tekai? Doch hoffentlich auf der richtigen...

Dieser Artikel hat genau so auch in der Printausgabe gestanden (nur ohne Fotos). Ich dachte zunächst, es sei eine Satire. Dass ein Historiker sich zu so etwas herablässt und die F.A.Z. solche gehirnerweichenden Vereinfachungen verbreitet, ist erschütternd. Ein historischer Konflikt mit nur einem einzigen Akteur, dem bösen Putin! Es ist so lächerlich.

Der Feminismus war damals wichtig und unabdingbar für die Gleichberechtigung der Frau. Er ist es auch heute noch, nur eben nicht in den Teilen der Welt, wo es diese Gleichberechtigung mittlerweile gibt. Feminismus müsste in den Nahen Osten, Afrika, eben jene Regionen in denen die rechtliche Gleichstellung der Frau noch nicht gegeben ist. 

Hier im Westen sollte der eigentlich im Humanismus aufgehen, der jeden Menschen einbezieht. Dies tut er nicht und hier stimme ich dem Autor auch völlig zu. Er senkt Standards und wird zur Diskriminierung eines Geschlechtes verwendet, genau das Gegenteil von dem, wofür der Feminismus einst zu Recht kämpfte.

Deshalb nenn ich die auch nur Feminazis, die haben mit den echten Feministen der damaligen Gleichberechtigungsbewegung nichts zu tun. Heute tummeln sich da vorwiegend dumme und verwöhnte Frauen, die für ihr Versagen das Patriarchat verantwortlich machen.

Erfolg hat das aber auch nur in den Breiten, in denen man einen Opferkult wie in Deutschland zelebriert. In Frankreich sind diese Debatten wie wir sie hier haben bspw. längst nicht so extrem, dort gibt es einfach zu viele selbstbewusste Frauen, die sich nicht als Opfer fühlen sondern ihre Geschicke selbst in die Hand nehmen.

&gt;Die dahinterstehenden ideologischen Grundüberzeugungen, daß Sexualität eine politische Angelegenheit sei, daß Sexualpolitik ein Mittel zur Gesellschaftsveränderung im linken Sinne sei und „sexuelle Befreiung“ daher schon ein Wert an sich, haben sie mit der Muttermilch aufgesogen und verinnerlicht.

Diese Grundüberzeugung, dass Sexualität eine politische Angelegenheit sei, findet man auch auf der anderen Seite des Parteienspektrums, in CDU/CSU oder AfD. Die interessieren sich auch dafür, was in fremden Schlafzimmern passiert und wollen dies staatlich verhindern oder dem zumindest Steine in den Weg legen. Man will die Gesellschaft dort eben nur nach christlichem Familienbild formen, etwas, dass ich ebenso verwerflich finde. 

Warum sollen Singels und unverheiratete Paare die hetero- und bald auch homosexuellen Ehen finanzieren? Aus welchem Grund? Die einen produzieren kaum noch der Gesellschaft nutzenden Nachwuchs, die anderen können es erst gar nicht. So eine Alimentierung machte vielleicht Sinn, als man noch davon ausging die nächsten Beitragszahler wachsen da auf, mittlerweile hat man sich davon aber verabschiedet, dementsprechend ist auch nicht einzusehen, wieso weiterhin all jene die unverheiratet sind Ehegattensplitting und ähnlichen Irrsinn finanzieren sollen. 

Man sieht, die Eingriffe staatlicherseits in die Familienplanung worunter auch die Sexualpolitik fällt sind auch von rechts nichts frei von Kritik.

Leider gibt es derzeit keine politische Kraft die sich gegen diesen ganzen Irrsinn ausspricht. Das Familienministerium gehört eigentlich mit allen Förderformen abgeschafft.

After making accusations against interior ministry officials, Magnitsky was arrested. He died in police custody five years ago after being denied medical care. Instead of ordering a proper investigation into Magnitsky’s murder, the Kremlin allegedly covered it up.

It will be interesting to see how this turns out. The US passed the [Magnitsky Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitsky_Act) barring the entry to the US of any Russian officials involved with his death. Russia retaliated by banning adoptions to the US despite the fact that American families adopted a disproportionately high number of Russian children with disabilities. Russia used children with Downs Syndrome as a political tool, and they are still paying the price today (ban never lifted). 

TL;DR:

&gt;“Consequently, when the US attorney’s office informed me of their source’s warning, I was alarmed. I understood the information they provided as a specific, credible threat that the Russian criminal enterprise – likely aided by the Russian government and/or secret police – were planning to kidnap and organise a rendition operation against me abroad.”

&gt;In 2013 the Russian authorities put Magnitsky posthumously on trial. They also convicted Browder and sentenced him to nine years in absentia.

Btw the budget law hasn't been done yet and the delegate deputy pm will have to take care of it instead. It's supposed to look ugly and maybe the PM didn't want to have his name on it. Funny thing, PSD ('sd' party) would kinda want to leave power but those in opposition don't want it yet. We may have early local elections next year or maybe we just wait for the ones in 2016. The PM went to Dubai with a mp who is also a little media mogul and he said he's gonna spend time his with sad family but instead he is clubbing. He lies very often. I think he did this mainly because his image got too low and maybe he hopes people will forget a bit about what happened recently. The PM has 27% trust in polls now.

After many years of hard work he had to sell his company for a pittance because at some point some he refused to pay a ""public servant"" a ""helping fee to speed things along"" for some proceding or another and had to close down for over a month. With the money he got from selling the company he managed to cover his debt and buy a plane ticket home.

*Protests about water charges:* A number of protests and public disturbances took place during the week in opposition to water charges, with protesters appearing at events where government ministers were visiting.

* A woman [tried to stand in front of the Prime Minister's car](http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/water-charges-protest-woman-intends-to-lodge-gsoc-complaint-651428.html) before being thrown to the ground by the police. 
* In another incident, [a group of protesters surrounded the Prime Minister's car](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/taoiseach-s-car-attacked-after-scuffles-erupt-in-sligo-1.2004742) in Sligo as he was about to attend an event, kicking and banging it with placards. 
* [A group of protesters (including a member of parliament from the Socialist party) performed a sit-in protest around the Deputy Prime Minister's car,](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/t%C3%A1naiste-s-car-blocked-by-water-charge-protesters-in-tallaght-1.2002762) effectively keeping her at a stand still for two hours. The police were also hit with eggs and water bombs in the incident. 

*Public altercations:* 

* [The government minister responsible for rolling out the water charges policy has said that he has received four death threats this week.](http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/two-further-menacing-death-threats-made-against-minister-alan-kelly-30758904.html)
* A number of violent incidents took place this week and last during the installation of water meters, with individuals sometimes getting violent against the workers installing them and the police. According to a Junior-Minister, [at least 50 assaults against workers have occurred to date.](http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/water/water-meter-workers-kicked-punched-bitten-30756505.html)

2. Werden Frauen aufgrund ihrer potentiellen Ausfallzeit wegen Kindern diskriminiert und das ist nunmal Fakt. Bei uns hat ein Manager mal offen zugegeben, das unter den Bewerbern ein Mädel war, dass um längen besser war , aber sie war auch Ende 20 und frisch verheiratet  war und man nunma damit rechnen müsse, dass sie in den nächsten Jahren aufgrund von Kindern ausfallen wird und einen Ausfall mitten in der Roll-out Phase des Projekts kann man sich nicht erlauben. Das ist absolut verständich und rational und ich hätte in der Situation wahrscheinlich ähnlich gehandelt. Dennoch bleibt da für mich als Frau ein bitterer nachgeschmackt.


Für mich wäre die optimale Lösung keine Frauenquote sondern eine obligatorische Elternzeit für angestelle Väter und Mütter, so dass die Ausfallgefahr von Mann und Frau in etwa gleich ist. Das wäre  effektiver als jede quote und würde misgunst unter den Angestellten verhindern.

The first thing I can tell you is that you will have to pass a french test with at least a level B2 (advanced-intermediate) in order to get accepted - normally with either the TCF or the DELF/DALF. The reality is that even with a level B2 classes will be very difficult. Those test don't test your medical vocabulary and that is not something you're going to learn in French class at university. Don't take that as discouragement! But that will be a big part of being prepared when you get here. 

You should consult [usa.campusfrance.org](http://www.usa.campusfrance.org/en/) which is the process through which you will apply. They have a *ton* of information - all of the practical aspects, etc. There are two ways to come - either as an exchange student or as an individual student. Theoretically, you can come as an individual student even if you plan on only staying a year but it may be more complicated to get your credits transferred back to your US university. The language requirement is may be more lax if you come in an exchange. If you come on your own, you will be enrolled in a french degree program - meaning if you enroll in the last year of undergradate studies in France (L3 or third year because undergrad degree programs are only three years) you will have a French degree at the end of that year. If you come in L2 you will be able to register for the next year L3. 

Also, someone please clarify this: In the US you do your undergraduate degree (licence) in biology/microbio/whatnot and THEN apply to med school (for your Bac+5). In *FRANCE* you apply directly to med school right out of high school, yeah? I see that [u/omlfc](www.reddit.com/u/omlfic) talks about the PACEs but I think its unclear if that's right out your BAC. So in France at BAC+1 you're *in* med school yeah? 

The above is important because it means that if you come to France for med school, your diploma might not be worth all that much - you could get retrograded (sent back a couple of years). Studies in France are very linear. There are no breadth courses like in the states. All French students do is study their subject while in the US you still have to take geology, litterature, and sociology. I'm sure that somone at CampusFrance can clarify how that works.

You can do pyshcology, not psychiatry, at a non-medical unviersity, in which case you're not subject to the medical school requirements and would just apply to a standard university.

Wie kommt hier eigentlich jeder immer zu der Überzeugung man müsse jemanden zu irgendetwas zwingen? 
Es sind die fehlenden Betreuungsmöglichkeiten, die es Frauen oft unmöglich machen in ihrem gewählten Beruf weiter arbeiten zu gehen. Andere Länder, besonders die skandinavischen aber auch Frankreich sind da schon viel weiter. Hier in Deutschland wird aber versucht kostengünstig über eine Quote einen solchen Zustand zwangsweise herzustellen, andere Vorschläge wie der deine sehen ""Zwangsausfallzeiten"" für Männer vor. 

Die Lösung, nämlich den Ausbau der Betreuungsmöglichkeiten, ignorieren alle Ansätze völlig. 

Der Staat sollte Chancengleichheit schaffen auf deren Basis die Gesellschaft dann macht was immer sie mag.

From what is on the press, his maternal grandfather made some money during world war 2 and left his mother some money and some modest houses (Cacém, for example), which have apparently been transacted and sold and upsold. the appartments in rua braancamp are not of the same level of price at all!

Also IIRC from another scandal, when Socrates´ brother died and there was a process by his widow (or ex-wife) on behalf of Socrates nieces against Socrates´s mother because the lady is accused of having removed money which should belong to the granddaughter from bank accounts, the estate Socrates´s brother left was quite decently modest.

That's why I said *probably*. 

&gt;whereas the Bretons fled only a few centuries ago and they already have a homeland, Wales.

According to Wikipedia, the Bretons migrated from Cornwall and Wales to Armorica around the 6th-9th centuries. That's more than just ""a few centuries ago"". By now they have developed a distinct cultural identity (different from the Cornish or Welsh people) and a different language (the Breton language is a separate language from Cornish or Welsh). You can't expect them to have Wales as their homeland, as it hasn't been so for almost 10 centuries. 

Besides, when the territory that we now know as France didn't exist yet. And the Bretons weren't given refuge by the French (as there was no people who identified as ""French"" yet), they immigrated to Armorica, displaced or intermixed with the original population (like it happened with the Romans and Visigoths that settled Iberia) and obviously didn't find much resistance. Eventually they would join other people from Francia to create the Kingdom of France, so I believe they have all rights to their land.

Dipende da cosa mi mandano. Ci sono un po' di trucchi. Tieni conto che noi mangiamo a casa solo una volta al giorno. Per esempio questa settimana è arrivato il cavolo nero, insalata riccia, zucca, carote, patate, carciofi, topinambur, sedano e cipolle.

Insalata mangiata subito. Cavolo nero infilato in una torta salata che ho congelato. Parte delle carote, cipolle e sedano surgelati a pezzettini per avere il soffritto pronto. Il resto delle cipolle, insieme alle patate, al buio in cantina durano fino a due settimane. La zucca mi fa da decorazione sul piano cucina per un po', e poi ci farò il risotto. Il topinambur in frigo dura fino a dieci giorni. E poi ho un grande sacchetto in freezer dove metto altre verdure se vedo che stanno per andare. Quando è pieno faccio il minestrone o il passato. Con le verdure estive si possono fare le conserve, o metterle sott'olio.

Per la frutta: ho le mele in consegna fissa perchè ne mangiamo tante. E durano un bel po'. Anche le arance d'inverno. Oppure cuocio le pere, faccio torte di susine, insomma una volta a settimana la cucina è mia e organizzo per i giorni successivi.

Il vantaggio maggiore per me, è non dover pensare a cosa comprare, andare a cercarlo sperando di trovarlo buono e a buon prezzo. E trovare soluzioni per quello che mi mandano è diventato una fonte di divertimento. Mi accontento di poco!

Capisco però che non a tutti può piacere non scegliere (anche se attraverso il sito si possono fare sostituzioni/aggiunte - non troverai le fragole a dicembre però).

Le commentaire original de /u/Otolia :

&gt; On peut avoir des idées politiques à 14ans. Sont-elles bonnes ?

A quoi je réponds 

&gt;Tu raffines tes idées en les confrontant à celles des autres. Si tu ne le fais jamais tu peux avoir 50 ans et avoir la réflexion politique d'une huître. 

Une manière de dire qu'un gamin de 14 ans qui a l'habitude de parler politique parce que ça l'intéresse aura parfois une réflexion politique plus aboutie qu'un type de 50 ans qui ne s'intéresse absolument pas à la politique.

Pour ton dernière commentaire :

&gt;Dans le contexte de la conversation, je ne pense pas avoir fait d'erreur. Un gamin de 14 ans peut avoir des convictions politiques sans pour autant être endoctriné.

&gt;Je dirais même que le fait que des parents influencent volontairement sur leur enfant ne constitue pas nécessairement un ""endoctrinement"".

On est tout à fait d'accord, s'il a commencé à s'y intéresser très jeune il peut tout à fait avoir ses propres idées.

*Moș Gerilă* (Uncle Frosty) was a Soviet tentative to replace Santa Claus (*Moș Crăciun*), first in the USSR and subsequently in occupied countries. It is based on a slavic pre-Christian counterpart to St. Nick, *Ded Moroz*, but the Soviets wouldn't have even that, and at least in Romania the character was originally depicted as [young and athletic](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Mo%C5%9F_Geril%C4%83_by_Romanian_communist_propaganda.JPG), eventually evolving to the canonical image of Santa (old fat man, big white beard, red clothing).

There were several problems with that, one being that there already was a *Gerilă* in Romanian folklore, but it had nothing to do with Christmas, family and presents - its an old, scary guy who masters frost, like an Ice Giant if you will.

Secondly, *Ge-ri-lă* has three syllables versus two in *Cră-ciun*, and that makes the replacement impossible in carols, as it breaks the meter. While such carols were banished from TV, people would still sing them at Christmas, so the replacement was never complete. As I remember, both names were used interchangeably (but only *Gerilă* on TV).

As a matter of fact, there were jokes deriding the imposter, like this pseudo-nursery rhyme:

&gt;*Moș Gerilă, Moș Gerilă, pe la noi dacă mai vii*    
&gt;*Cu asemenea prostii*    
&gt;*Eu te bag în pizda mă-tii*    
&gt;*Și mă piș pe jucării*

&gt;*Santa Frost, Santa Frost, if you keep bringing*    
&gt;*Rubbish like that*    
&gt;*Fuck you, asshole*    
&gt;*I'll pee on your toys*

**Germany to allow fracking before the end of the year**

- The German Government proposes a law to lift the ban of shale gas extraction via unconventional fracking (use of extra explosives, drillings and chemicals). The ban will remain intact close to drink water wells and protected
areas. First probings are planed for 2019 to explore the constitution of potential shale gas extraction sites in the North of Germany. Most opposition comes from the South, Green activists and farmers. *Comment: Ironically farmers have
no problem with water polution when it comes to manure.*

**Hooligan demonstration against Salafists in Hannover was minimal**

- After the surprising demonstrations in Cologne the police tightly controlled demonstrations in Hannover. The demonstrators could not confront the counter-demonstrations and many left early as the police maintained
control. Counter-demonstrations were larger in number than the Hooligans, but also more agressive as they tried to engage directly with Hooligans. Any hopes that such demonstrations could be an acceptable expression
of unease were shattered by the paroles growled by the Hooligans such as ""Germany, Germany, raise your fist, the pigs have to be thrown out"". On a political note many AfD (right eurosceptic party) attended the demonstration
in Cologne and the chapter in Hannover did not want to be associated with more right-wing activists and therefore forbid their members to participate in order not to thward their public image. *Comment: I find it interesting
enough that this is even a concern for them*.[NZZ; EN-translated](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nzz.ch%2Finternational%2Fenttaeuschte-deutsche-rechte-1.18426030&amp;sandbox=1)

**Pacifist The Left potentially will be owner of a weapons manufacturer soon**

- The State of Thuringia bought into the high-tech company Jenoptik in 2011. Officially because it was a good investment, but there have been rumors that otherwise a hedgefond would have dissembled Jenoptik. The company produces
parts from Leopard 2 tanks over Eurofighters to Patriot air defence systems. If Ramelow becomes the first prime minister for The Left, he will also be the first politician from The Left to own a weapons factory. The Left has a
long tradition of non-violence policy and tries to generally forbid weapons export from Germany. Nonetheless Jenoptik is one of the few high-tech companies in Eastern Germany and putting it down for the own ideology might not
be the easy choice for the future prime minister to be. On the other hand Gregor Gysi - party head of The Left - was publicly attacked for suggesting weapon support for Kurds in August*, though he retracted that opinion later on to go back in line with his party's official policy^1*. The Left in Thuringia commented ""We have not
yet thought about this"".

**German schools don't go digital**

- According to the ICILS-study Germany's school have the same quota of computers per student as in 2006 - 1 computer per 11 students. The is no standardized approach to teaching with digital media and the usage depends on the
preference of the teacher. Under the current circumstances Thailand or Chile have a better computer usage with school students. ICILS pleads for more digital education for teachers to prepare the next generation better for its
digital future.

- Neither SPD (socialists) nor CDU(conservatives) plan to militarily support Ukraine; neither plan to cut talks with Russia; both however claim that the manner of talking with Russia used by the other side is
wrong. German politicians hope for a second Detenté as under Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik.

**German MP's visit Britain to discuss British demands**

- German MP's were annoyed as talks did not yield any results. In the following press conference they vented their anger with a lot of accusations. Amongst these that Cameron is a ""butterfly in the wind"", trying to look
good but having no control of the situation and further expanding as what Britain really needs would be a lion, dictating a clear direction. The more calm answer were that Germany will not support Britain unconditionally
and any Brexit would close the internal market for them and re-entering the market could only be possible after a new negotiation. This explicitly means that Britain would loose all its favourable deals it currently maintains
with the EU. That being said the German MP's were surprised that it was even an option for Britain, because being out of the EU, but in the internal market means loosing all favourable deals, having to comply with EU standards and
having no say in it. According to the newspaper this visit went unnoticed by British media.

**Bavarian Prime Minister Seehofer clashes with Chinese Police on the Tiananmen Square**

- Seehofer was giving an interview to German television on the historic site. When locals started to flock around them the police resolved the gathering and stopped any recording (from bystanders and TV stations alike). The excuses
ranged from ""no permission for audio recording"" to ""surpassing the allowed videoing time of 2 minutes"". The interview was retaken inside the Palace of Culture - off-limits for the public. Seehofer's visit is supposed to improve
trade relations between Bavaria and China as China is their third largest trading partner.

**Airport BER to open earliest mid 2017 - delay expected**

- The new airport for the capital Berlin has been delayed since 2011 and sources explain that it won't be ready until 2018 despite official claims to open in 2017. After a cost explosion the fire protection system was not up to the
required standard and the system had to be reinstalled in the whole airport (and currently is still being installed).

**ECB's new headquarter under protest**

- The ECB is building a new headquarter in Frankfurt. The construction site has been stormed by 80 activists and heavy clashes with the police ensued. Between 2000 to 3000 demonstrators were standing before the construction site.
The protests are directed against the European management of the economic crisis. The ECB is seen as a main actor in the crisis and constructing itself a 1.2 billion euro headquarter is seen as an offense by the demonstrators.

*Local elections*

From the last news round-up:

&gt;Local elections are being held today. Voters are choosing their mayors and their representatives in two-three governing bodies.

These elections turned out to be a disaster. 

The computer system of National Electoral Commission (PKW) didn't work. [(1)](http://thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/187625,Computer-glitch-hampering-local-election-vote-count) For some reason PKW resigned from the old one and 4 months before the elections launched a tender for a new one. Only one company agreed to design, test and implement it for less than 120 000€. The IT system failed tests before the elections, but was used anyway.  [(2, Polish)](http://forsal.pl/artykuly/835826,kontrowersyjny-przetarg-na-oprogramowanie-dla-pkw-system-powstal-w-trzy-miesiace.html) The source code of one of its modules leaked into the Internet (it should be open-source in the first place anyway) and it turned out to be a complete crap [(more on /r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2ml27h/source_code_of_polish_electoral_calculator_big/) and [ DailyWTF)](http://what.thedailywtf.com/t/polish-electorial-calculator/4963/2). PKW decided to count votes by hand. [ - not without problems:](http://img.wiocha.pl/images/a/3/a3659e69f6b96343160d2b5f27ac1f59.jpg) 

* &gt; In front of the office were hundreds of angry Commissions' members and thousands of boxes with ballots on the ground, brought there in private cars. Bags (some of them ripped) were ordered to be put in the hall. We had to wait there until 8 am. My commission was writing table with Rozenek's results by hand on printed protocols because it didn't print out properly. [(3, Polish)](http://niebezpiecznik.pl/post/problemy-w-pkw-zliczanie-glosow-wyborcow-sie-opoznia-zawiodl-system-informatyczny/) The case is now investigated by the Highest Office of Control [(4, Polish)](http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/news-wybory-samorzadowe-2014-nik-zajmie-sie-systemem-informatyczn,nId,1553248)

* &gt; We were too tired to count them properly [(5, video in Polish)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_7rh-b2IH0)

* [Presidential elections in Szczecin won by a guy who wasn't on a ballot](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2mri45/official_results_of_municipal_elections_in_poland/)

On Tuesday hackers broke into PKW servers ans stole state officers' usernames and passwords. [(6, Polish)](http://niebezpiecznik.pl/post/wlamanie-na-serwery-panstwowej-komisji-wyborczej-wykradziono-hashe-hasel-i-klucze-urzednikow/). This is being investigated by Internal Security Agency.

On Wednesday the first official results were announced. They didn't include the results of voivodship assemblies voting. The invalid votes rate was locally as high as 40%. Some members of Electoral Commission suggest that people were confused by a ballot in form of a little book. [(7)](http://thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/187751,Local-elections-first-official-results-in), [(8, Polish)](http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1342,title,Rekordowa-liczba-niewaznych-glosow-do-sejmikow,wid,17043252,wiadomosc.html?ticaid=113dae&amp;_ticrsn=5)

Opposition called for repeating the elections. President called this idea 'madness'. 

The head of Electoral Bureau resigned on Thursday, after 23 years of service. [(9)](http://thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/187861,Electoral-office-chief-resigns-over-delayed-results) 

On Friday protesters broke into PKW HQ. Police intervened. [(10)](http://thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/187980,Police-intervene-as-protesters-occupy-electoral-commission-HQ) 

On Saturday all members of PKW resigned. [(11)](http://thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/188116,Entire-Electoral-Commission-resigns)

Today PKW announced the official general results of voivodship assemblies elections. **The rate of invalid votes is as high as 18%, and the results don't match the exit polls** (PSL - junior coalition member - having 40% more votes than expected). Because of the voting system the ruling party PO wins more seats despite having less votes than PiS.

When something happens in Ukraine like maidan and the subsequent Russian reaction other Eastern European nations will be automatically caught up in this because they are part of the same post Soviet reality. The US, which has similar interests regarding Russia knows this full well and uses this to point its finger at us.

But Western Europe doesn't share that history nor is it served with alienating Russia. What Eastern European and Russian politicians are saying today sounds foreign to us and reminds us of a very fucked up age before socialism fell. We get some simplified news where Russia invades once or twice a week but we don't understand what is going on. Because it's a complicated story which isn't about us. And I believe that very few Westerners wish to be embroiled in this Eastern European mess.

You say that Europe was caught with its pants down when Crimea and later MH17 happened. Actually the whole situation didn't prove that we were caught like that but that there never was a 'we' to begin with. After Crimea we did nothing.

I am somewhat tired of the notion that it is irrational not to want to eat insects, even if you eat shrimp.

Perceiving shrimp as clean and edible and insects as dirty and disgusting is completely reasonable for a human that has experienced the typical human environment.

Shrimp live in water and are permanently surrounded by water.

Now think about when and where in your life there are insects.

Häufig liegt es nicht an der Hardware, sondern an der Software. Deshalb würde ich erstmal keinen neuen Computer kaufen. Trotzdem würde ich heutzutage nicht gerne mehr Arbeit in Computer stecken, wo keine SSD drin ist. Glücklicherweise kann man eine SSD bei den meisten Rechnern nachrüsten. 

Grob gesagt würde ich so vorgehen:

1. SSD kaufen.

http://geizhals.de/crucial-m550-128gb-ct128m550ssd1-a1086129.html

2. Rechner mit SSD neu installieren. Windows 7. Microsoft scheint sich nicht mehr um Raubkopierer zu kümmern. Die meisten günstigen Lizenzen bei Ebay sind eh gefälscht. Also warum einem Fälscher noch €30 in den Rachen werfen? Windows Loader von DAZ googeln. Oder gleich ein aktuelles gepatchtes Windows-7-Image von My Boerse runterladen. Wenn Du mit einer Windows 7 SP1 DVD installierst, dann muss er am Anfang hunderte Patches laden und installieren. 

Wenn es klappt, dann gut, wenn nicht (also Hardware Schuld), dann:

3. Laptop kaufen. Und zwar einen Refurbished Business Laptop. Dell Latitude oder Lenovo Thinkpad. Hier:

http://store.eurocomputerland.de/

http://www.gebrauchtcomputer24.de/

http://www.luxnote-hannover.de/

http://www.esm-computer.de/

Anschließend die SSD, die Du gekauft hast, in den Laptop rein und fertig. Wenn Du Glück hast, dann sollte es ohne Neuinstallation gehen. Achtung: Am Besten vor der ersten SSD-Installation in Deinem alten Laptop die Festplatte auf ""AHCI-Modus"" umstellen. Im neuen dann auch. Dann sollte es wirklich kein Problem sein die Installation einfach weiter zu verwenden.

Wenn Du noch Fragen hast, bzw. wenn Du Dich an meine Tipps halten willst, dann antworten oder PM, dann kann ich Dir noch weitere Infos geben. ",0,1416748915,null,0,false,0,cmalnm8,t3_2n5rtz,t1_cmalnm8,t3_2n5rtz,null,1425883530,0,false,de,t5_22i0,0
