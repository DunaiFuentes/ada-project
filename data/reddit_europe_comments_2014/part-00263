The EU side has never really had a chance to make our case, and people have changed their opinions when they realise what the EU has done for the UK. 

I also think its a generational thing, anecdotally the young people like me are probably far more pro-EU due to things like Erasmus etc. than older people, we are slowly becoming more European as a country. UKIP are the oldest demographic of any UK party

I don't get why people in the UK sometimes fail to see that we are European, our Language is very European (Its a Germanic Romance hybrid for crying out loud) culturally we are closer to Europe than say the US (despite a common language) and a stack load of Brits live in Europe now.

English people aren't some sort of evil culture that we don't want in our country, they are just ordinary people who need access to a good affordable Higher education as their own government is fucking t up for them. English Students won't replace Scots at all. If they are to replace anyone it will be other EU students. Then again all students have to have the grades to qualify to get into the Universities no matter their Nationality

Since the amount of EU Students won't change. I.e any new English Welsh or Northern Irish Students will just compete with other EU students such as Poles, Germans, French The budget for free tuition won't actually increase - Except from other external influences such as inflation.

di Alberto Infelise

&gt; Ma allora lo fanno apposta. Certo, non è “Una storia italiana”, l’imperdibile tomo fotografico con il quale Berlusconi raccontò in sole 125 pagine la sua ventura di successi. Ma le 36 pagine del libretto che oggi verrà distribuito alla Festa dell’Unità (senza l’Unità in allegato, peraltro) sono un passo definitivo verso il nuovo concetto di understatement con il quale il Pd ha deciso di caratterizzare il suo presente. Titolo: “40,8%. Lo scatto”.  

 

&gt;Foto di copertina che ritrae i vincitori del Nazareno la notte delle Europee e poi via, con i racconti emozionati di chi quella vittoria l’ha vissuta in prima linea. Per riassumere: vittoria inattesa ma meritata, vittoria di tutti gli italiani (chissà poi perché), vittoria che lungi dal far dormire sugli allori è sprone per il futuro. E allora ecco il timido Matteo che si mette ordinatamente in ordine alfabetico in mezzo agli altri, ecco Maria Elena che lo sapeva che si vinceva e tutti la prendevano in giro («continuavo a dire 33, 33, come dal medico»), Lotti e Stumpo che fino al mese prima se l’erano date di santa ragione a festeggiare insieme, Guerini che condivide l’entusiasmo evangelico del premier («Chiamate tutti e andate»), Mogherini che riceve messaggi da tutta Europa (chiaro segno premonitore), l’epico Pittella che ricorda “Era de maggio”, Nicodemo che cita se stesso (e vabbè) e poi Springsteen (e insomma). Sarebbe ingeneroso però comparare l’operazione al Silvione del “miracolo italiano”. Qui siamo più dalle parti del “miracolo europeo”.

Due dates for applications to Master's programs in Germany generally range from March 15th to June 15th, so by then you'll need to be able to provide German-certified copies from the embassy of all of your education certificates- that means diplomas, transcripts, etc., including high school- if it's in Spanish, you'll also need to get certified translations of all of it into German (they also accept English originals, but I'm not sure if they'll accept translations into English). Depending on the specific program, you'll also need to prove sufficient knowledge of German and/or English, so make sure that you'll be able to get certified with the TOEFL or TestDaF or whatever before you send in your application. (A lot of schools will let you put this off until you enroll in September/October, but it's best if you can just get it done beforehand.) Add on to that any other random things the uni wants from you like a passport photo or the results of your college aptitude test or blah blah blah...

On top of that, all of this needs to be *received by the University* by the deadline. Getting it into the mail in Mexico two days before the deadline will not cut it, so you probably will have to consider your personal deadline as lying a few weeks before the actual deadline.

It's relatively easy as far as competition etc. to get into German universities as far as I know (compared to the US anyway); there's just a lot of frustrating paperwork involved in them making sure that your foreign qualifications are sufficient. It's best if you start early because it's easy for random snags to turn up that will delay you finishing the application for weeks. I started planning my Bachelor's applications in April and still just barely managed to get them in by the July 15 deadline because of a hassle with getting my old SAT results.

I'm an American about to start a Bachelor's in Germany right now, so I have some experience with the German uni application process for non-EU foreigners.

Putin's strategic goal here is to create a stable New Russia region that can serve as his pawn. To do that, he has to win a stable, credible ceasefire that creates a balance of military power in the region. A ceasefire like that requires:

1. That Kiev troops be pushed out of rebel regions

2. That rebel territory be consolidated within defensible lines

Number 1 has mostly been achieved in the past few days by. Number 2 is what Mariupol is all about.

Mariupol sits pretty on the main North-South road to Donetsk, H20, which means that whoever controls Mariupol controls the South-side access to Donetsk (that is, Kiev can't launch an offensive on Donetsk from the South with Russian troops ready to hit them from the back from Mariupol).

E58, the main road going West-East in Souther-Eastern Ukraine, the Main road connecting rebel territory to Crimea, also goes through Mariupol. While control of Mariupol doesn't guaranteed control of that land route, it would Russian provide troops a much better staging area from which to spring an offensive towards Crimea, following E58 to Melitopol, compared to, say, Donetsk itself or Taganrog.

To get a global view, look at the conflict's [map](http://liveuamap.com/?ll=47.1301467606316;35.630605468749984&amp;zoom=7#). See what Russia is doing? it's creating a series of salients, salients that slice through Kiev territory along main road networks to reach regional capitals. That means that those cities can be easilly reinforced and resupplied from Russia, while Kiev troops in the East are cut out of similar West-bound supply lanes to their territory. Mariupol is the last piece they need to complete this network of cities and transport routes that grants Russia military control of the East.

I'm calling it here: this war isn't going to die down until Russia has Mariupol. If it takes it, we're likely to see a true ceasefire.",0,1410100528,null,0,false,0,ckbksyh,t3_2fp79o,t1_ckbksyh,t3_2fp79o,null,1427152249,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

 As-tu une source ou je pourrai lire le contre-argumentaire FN dont tu parles? 

&gt; On voit ce qu'on appelle un dérapage au FN de temps en temps, c'est vrai, mais il se passe bien pire dans les autres partis et personne ne relève rien. En plus les gens ne sont même pas exclus contrairement au FN. 

 Peux-tu me donner un exemple de tel dérapage, qui soit pire par exemple qu'un salut hitlérien à la Gabriac et que personne n'aurait relevé mais dont toi, étonnamment, serais au courant ? 

&gt; Ensuite je crois que ta haine envers le FN t’empêche de regarder les idées, elle sont innombrables et couvre tout les domaines. 

 Il ne t’est pas venu à l'esprit que ma ""haine"" (c’est toi qui le dit d’ailleurs) envers le FN puisse justement provenir de certaines ""idées"" qu'ils proposent, et de la teinte *contrôle-flicage-sanction* omniprésente dans celles-ci ? 

&gt; Tu serais incapable de me citer un sujet de politique que le FN ne couvre pas. 

Exact : ils couvrent tout. C'est assez marrant d'ailleurs quand tu compares leur programme 2007, profondément indigent, au programme 2012. Cela dit, le fait de tout couvrir n’est absolument pas un gage de pertinence. On peut tout couvrir, mais n’importe comment, n’est-ce-pas ?

03 Sep 2014 (**4 days ago**) this website (The Russian Times) was registered as a media by the state censorship agency ""Roskomnadzor"".

Let's make it clear. The website, that OP is promoting here, was made for only one purpose: to discredit well-known news media [""The Moscow Times""](http://themoscowtimes.com).

The latter has been operating on hospitable Finnish soil and remains one of the few respected media which provides information about russia at first hand. It was predictable that state-owned propaganda would try to ruin a reputation of their rival.

I'm not trying to take anything away from anyone. Scottish people in favour of independence would be the ones taking away that national identity from Scots who consider themselves British.

&gt;Scot's have just as much right to the term 'British' as English.

Yeah I agree, assuming they also have a British passport.

That somebody seriously considers asking backstabbers if they need fucking help instead of locking them up... that's... no.
This Volk will die if it goes on like this. And it'll be well deserved.

Everybody of Bolshevik leanings should be arrested and investigated and if it is found that they even so much as touched a red flag , they should never see the light of day, or their famiuly, again.

Wie beim letzten Mal. Ich musste meiner geistigen Gedsundheit wegen aufhören auf deinen Schund zu antworten. Da hab ich größere Erfolgsaussichten einem 5jährigen die Größe unseres Universum verständlich zu machen.

Man, das streitet der doch nichtmal selber ab. Geht da hin und redet über Putin, wie er in seinem Rasputinturm sitzt und die Weltherrschaft plant. Postet dort die Lügen der ukrainischen Regierung die eine Halbwertszeit von wenigen Stunden haben.

Ich mache mir die Mühe hier auch nur um euch ab und an zu zeigen, dass die Welt da draußen ein wenig anders ist. Aber ihr besteht darauf das ihr Recht habt und nehmt selektiv nur das wahr, was eure Meinung unterstützt. Das ist so dümmlich, man könnte meinen ihr seid so geboren worden.

Das ist auch der Grund warum man euch ständig mit Fundamentalisten gleichsetzt, ihr die ihr auf Indymedia und anderen Verwirrtenplattformen eure Weltsicht zum Ausdruck bringt. Ihr bekommt es hin, dass Friedensdemonstrationen etwas schlechtes sind, weil nicht ihr dort protestiert. Das ist die übelste und dümmste Denke die sich dort bei euch eingeschlichen hat, es ist nur noch Wahnsinn.

Ihr seid obsolet, eure Zeit ist um, eure Ziele führen wieder zurück in unfreiere Gesellschaften. Ihr seid die, welche sich nicht mit der Geschichte ändern konnten und ihr wehrt euch mit Händen und Füßen dagegen, dass diese euch vergisst. 

Deshalb müsst ihr stets das selbe Lied eurer verkorksten Weltsicht singen, immer wieder, auf und ab, auch wenn euch niemand darum bittet.

Illegal according to Serbia, which Kosovo was an integral part of. Kosovo's case is different from Croatia, Bosnia or Montenegro as it wasn't one of the Yugoslavian republics. And perhaps there's no international law which prohibits parts of countries from unilaterally seceding, but that's a very dangerous precedent which was proven by Abkhasia, South Ossetia and Crimea cases. What if Hungarians in Transylvania declared unilaterally independence? Or Poles in Lithuanian Vilnius region? What about Serbs in Mitrovica? Republika Srpska in Bosnia? 

No, how Czechoslovakia was broken down into Czech Republic and Slovakia, or possible Scotland independence after the bilaterally agreed referendum is the way such issues should be resolved.

Il est absolument impossible pour le FN et les autres partis de contrôler tous leurs militants et pour moi ils ne sont donc pas responsable des comportements déviants. L'important est l'attitude que le parti adopte à posteriori. 

Si un homme fait un crime pédophile avec une carte de EELV dans la poche, pourra tu impliquer la responsabilité du parti ? Bien sur que non.

[Sir James Goldsmith at the 1996 Referendum Party Conference in Brighton.](http://www.freebritain.co.uk/gold2.html)

&gt;*My last specific comment concerns the wording of the question to be submitted to the electorate in a referendum.*

&gt;*We are convinced that the question must address the fundamental issues of our relationship with Europe.*

&gt;*We must not let the politicians get away with a* **false referendum**.

&gt;*For example. a question limited to the single currency would fail to address all the other vital issues: our right to legislate, to run our economy, to control our foreign affairs, our national security and our frontiers.*

And what the Conservatives were offering:-

&gt;*Just look at the Conservative pledge for a referendum. It is limited to the single currency and sidesteps all the really important issues about our independence.*

&gt;*It requires that the Conservatives win the next general election; that the Cabinet approve it; that Parliament vote for it. Not in a free vote but with a three line party whip.*

Let's compare to Cameron and the Conservatives of today:-

[EU referendum: Tories will be the only party to let you choose, says Cameron](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/10692045/EU-referendum-Tories-will-be-the-only-party-to-let-you-choose-says-Cameron.html) 12 March 2014:-

&gt;*""The British people now have a very, very clear choice,"" the Prime Minister said at the start of a two-day visit to the Middle East.*

&gt;*""At the next election they can elect a Conservative government that will renegotiate Britain's position in Europe and give people a guaranteed in-out referendum by of end of 2017.*

&gt;*""If they get a Labour government they will get no referendum, no choice, no reform, nothing.*

Check-list:-

* Cast-Iron Cameron's Promise this time he won't break it like he did with Lisbon
* You must first vote for Conservatives
* Conservatives have to win the 2015 General Elections
* The Reform which is unclear has to be negotiated in 2017 at a time when the PM will be President of the Council of Europe.
* Article 48 Lisbon Treaty has been ruled out so it's a Wilsonian Fudge on offer for Reform ie ""within existing treaties"" only therefore no major change.
* Cameron will vote IN the EU no matter what and will campaign to stay in.

Ich verstehe die Aufregung daher nicht.

Was genau hast du da oben ""erklärt""? Das war eine wirre Aneinanderreihung von Verschwörungstheorien. 

&gt; und dann findest du wieder irgendwo einen Buchstaben

Na komm schon. Es ging schon um mehr als ""Buchstaben"". Es ging eigentlich um das Gerüst auf dem deine Position zur Ukrainkrise fußt und die war nicht einmal innerhalb deiner Verschwörungstheorie konsistent. 

&gt; Ich fühle mich hier wirklich als ob ich durch ein Meer von unterentwickelten Bekloppten wate, die stets irgendwelchen Unsinn hinausposaunen, der bar jeder Logik ist. 

Das kann ich mir vorstellen. Es ist viel einfacher in den entsprechenden Foren und Facebookgruppen dem circlejerk zu frönen als hier wo weder der Moderator einer der Betroffenen ist noch der Großteil der Meute die exakt gleiche Meinung hat. Damit musst du schon klar kommen. Lass dir halt was einfallen.

&gt; Das ist auch der Grund warum man euch ständig mit Fundamentalisten gleichsetzt, ihr die ihr auf Indymedia und anderen Verwirrtenplattformen eure Weltsicht zum Ausdruck bringt.

Tut ""man"" das? Wo tut man das den? Gib uns doch mal einen Einblick in die große Welt der versteckten Wahrheiten.

They all have in common: They're weak arguments deconstructed very easily.

Even genuine Anti-EU'ers provide fallacious plans even if they're actually sincere - they're misguided.

So this ""argument from authority"" or perhaps ""reputable argument"" may appear convincing compared to some random redditor's word, but we can check this very easily:-

[Comparing the current EU vs EEA propositions: A quick summary](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/22flgf/eu_commissioner_admits_75_of_national_laws_made/cgmegp8)

&gt;*We would have to abide by most EU laws with no say in them whatsoever.*

No one is arguing the EEA is idea, but the argument is asserting that:-

1. It's better than the EU (see link) hence achieves all reform does and more and actually achieves what apparent reform in the EU attempts but cannot deliver on.
2. Once out of the EU, and in the EEA, it is authentically possible to reform, you can't do that in the EU without triggering Article 48 TEU Lisbon Treaty - which is ruled out by all major EU ""big-wigs"".
3. There's actually less laws in the EEA as it's 80% of the acquis so there's already a concrete saving (see link).
4. Norway themselves have veto et al. so that primary evidence disproves having no say (see link again).

&gt;*We would still have freedom of movement so UKIP voters and racists would not be satisfied.*

I can see you have an ideological reason for this pretense: You reveal far more about yourself and your intentions than commentary on the EU in the spirit of true discussion requires.

&gt;*In Norway they call it rule by fax machine. Also, EEA countries have to contribute a considerable amount for their access.*

All disproven - again see link.

The opposition to UKIP and Farage seem to mainly focus on character assassination and trying to shut him up rather than taking the effort to tackle his ideas head on. 

I personally favour an EU that remains a loosely bound confederacy with a common market where each of the member states fully controls their respective legal systems, economies, etc., but where there is a confederate government which keeps an oversight just in case, for instance, a member-state violates human rights (a role that is fulfilled by the ECHR). I don't think the EU should become a full federation, which is the obvious direction the EU is taking. 

I also think that the EU has developed many anti-democratic and bully-boy traits, for example here in Ireland where the EU rejected the Irish ""No"" vote when we had referenda on the Nice and Lisbon treaties and pushed us to vote again a few months later, without really addressing the Irish concerns properly. Lest we forget that Ireland was the only country who allowed its people to vote on the Lisbon treaty (because the Irish constitution mandates a referendum in order to change the constitution), and I've no doubt how other countries would have voted if their respective governments had offered similar referenda. 

Eurocrats seem to only like democracy when it favour's *their* agenda, which is a centralised Europe-wide political union.

true,nieuchwytnyuchwyt,POLA,Rzeczpospolita Polska,"&gt; I find it really hard to believe that all this motivated you to join a protest against Kosovo's independence. Were you really that worried about what Kosovo's independence might set for the future of the world? Are you sure there wasn't another reason?

Of course, at least partially. And subsequent events only cemented my opinion.

Another factor is that being Polish I know well how does it feel to have core parts of your territory lost due to decisions of great powers, but I didn't mention it because it's a purely subjective reason.

&gt; I believe Kosovo is a special case, considering the oppression of albanian people (who make 90% and more of the Kosovo population, that is almost 2 million people) by the Serb regime.

Of course I am well aware of that, that's why I agreed that this territory should be under UN control until true autonomy under Serbia/bilaterally agreed independence/transfer of territory to Albania was negotiated. 

Also, Albanians aren't particurarily innocent either in this whole conflict. There were severe atrocities on both sides of the conflict, though I have no doubt Serbian ones were more numerous.

&gt; Still, I believe that people should have the right for self-determination anywhere in the world. If the majority of people in Northern Kosovo want to be within Serbia, then so be it.

Glad to see your opinion, but it's sad that the government of Kosovo doesn't share it.

&gt; You won't be able to sympathize with Kosovo or Abkhasia or any other similar cases unless you find yourself to be in the same position. Or unless you put the mental effort to imagine yourself in the same position.

In the 19th century Poland was occupied by foreign powers for over 100 years so recognizing other nations struggle for independence isn't an alien thought to me. 

Still, I don't think independence acquired in such circumstances should be recognized by my country especially when it hypocritically choses to recognize only cases where the supporting great power is allied with us.

And at last, is there a Kosovar nation though? Of course not, you are Albanians living in what used to be Serbia. That's why I would sooner approve of Albanian annexation of Albanian-majority areas of Kosovo than independence of Kosovo.",0,1410109493,null,0,false,0,ckbogl1,t3_2fprbe,t1_ckbogl1,t1_ckbnsad,null,1427149311,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

true,crnaruka,SRPS,Republika Srpska,"After the civil war, there were two military camps under the political administration of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (a Bosniak-Croatian alliance) and Republika Srpska (the Serbian side). The Dayton Accords that ended the war created a loose confederation of the two entities under a common federal government. In practice, each entity has continued to operate almost as an independent state except for areas like foreign policy and international representation.

The problem now is that while everyone recognizes that the current system is utterly ineffective, no major changes are possible since both sides would regard a significant change as a violation of the Dayton Accords and thus as an effective cancellation of the ceasefire, which could lead to a new round of hostilities. If Republika Srpska were to unilaterally declare indepdendence, the Federation could in principle be willing to use force  to stop this from happening. Alternatively, if the Federation would try to unilaterally push through a constitutional reform creating a much more centralized country, Republika Srpska may choose to secede, again risking war.

&gt; noch der Großteil der Meute die exakt gleiche Meinung hat

Haha, es ist so lächerlich mit dir. /r/de hat genau eine Meinung. Das ist hier ein Sammelbecken für Verschwörungstheoretiker die sich ausschließlich durch die deutschen Propagandamedien bilden. Ab und an schaut mal noch jemand anders vorbei, aber ihr wisst ja wie das mit dem Downvoten von Fakten funktioniert.

&gt;Moment. Kriechst du nicht gerade einem Typen hinten rein der grad den Kalten Krieg wieder aus der Gosse gefischt hat? 

Das ist der Punkt. Ihr rennt mit einer Weltsicht rum, die absolut unhaltbar ist. Ihr behauptet einfach Dinge, die faktisch falsch sind.

Die Proteste, welche in der Ukraine zum Putsch führten und all die Ereignisse auf der Krim und nun in der Ostukraine in Gang setzten, gingen ausschließlich vom Westen aus. Das wird ja mittlerweile von keinem klar denkenden Menschen mehr bestritten. Die russische Administration hatte nie ein Problem mit der Ukraine unter Janukowytsch. Die Verträge waren alle eingehalten, der Mann war demokratisch gewählt, alles völlig in Ordnung. 

Dann kommen durch den Putsch Faschisten an die Macht, es sollen die Verträge über den russischen Militärhafen an Krim nicht verlängert werden. Absolut inakzeptabel für die russische Administration. Also sorgt man dafür, dass die vornehmlich russische Bevölkerung der Krim sich für einen Beitritt Russlands entscheidet. Entsprach wohl nicht dem Völkerrecht, auf dies scheißt aber sowieso jeder, warum sollte sich also ausgerechnet die russische Administration daran halten? Eben.

So, nun will ja der Rest der Ukraine unbedingt schnell in die Nato, dafür wurde ja die natogesponsorte Regierung dort ins Amt geputscht. 

Das läuft den Interessen der russischen Administration auch entgegen, man wird, und das weiß der Westen seit dem Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion, nicht zulassen, dass die Nato an Russland grenzt. Was geschieht also? Die vornehmlich russische Bevölkerung in der Ostukraine wird unterstützt in ihren Bestrebungen sich nicht von der faschistischen Junta in Kiew regieren zu lassen. 

Nun ist dies nicht das erste Mal, das dies geschieht. Bereits im Georgienkonflikt, das ebenso unbedingt in die Nato wollte und dazu einen abtrünnigen Landesteil bombardierte, griff Russland ein. Es geht denen nicht darum sich dieses Land einzuverleiben, sondern Teile des Staatsgebietes in der Hand von Autonomen und den politischen Konflikt so am Leben zu halten. Warum? Weil die Nato kein Land aufnehmen wird, welches sich noch in einem Bürgerkrieg oder einem ähnlichen Zustand befindet. Die Verträge würden dann nämlich zu Aktionen verpflichten, die man tunlichst vermeiden will. 

Also hat die russische Administration hier ausschließlich ihre Interessen vertreten, in einem Konflikt der ihr aufgedrängt wurde. 

Schauen wir uns doch mal andere Länder an, die auch noch Grenze mit Russland teilen. Schweden und Finnland. EU Mitglieder, aber keine Natomitglieder. Nichtmal jetzt wird über einen Beitritt nachgedacht, der Großteil der Bevölkerung in beiden Ländern lehnt das ab. Warum? 

Weil man dort die russischen Sicherheitsinteressen akzeptiert hat. Fertig. Dort findet keine Invasion statt, dort werden keine Freiheitskämpfer durch Russland unterstützt, es gibt dort schlicht keinen Konflikt. Alles nur weil diese Länder sich aus der Nato heraushalten. Und es ist nicht einmal so, dass jegliche Kooperation mit der Nato verboten wäre. Im Gegenteil, diese Länder intensivieren ihre Zusammenarbeit ohne ein Wort des Unwohlseins aus Russland. Nur der Beitritt geht eben nicht.

Wir fassen also nochmal für die ganz Dummen zusammen:

1. Die US Administration unterstützt einen Putsch gegen einen demokratisch gewählten Präsidenten in der Ukraine um eine proamerikanische Marionettenregierung einzusetzen, welche den Weg in die Nato nehmen soll.

2. Die russische Administration reagiert darauf entsprechend, sichert ihre Militärbasis in der Krim und holt diese über eine Volksabstimmung nach Russland zurück. Bequem und unblutig, in der Tradition des missachteten Völkerrechts.

3. Die Marionettenregierung strebt weiterhin in die Nato, nun mit einem kleineren Land. Auch dies lässt die russische Administration nicht zu und schafft in der Ostukraine einen Puffer. 

Wer auch nur über den geringsten Intellekt verfügt, merkt auch, dass die Russen die Ostukraine nicht an Russland angliedern wollen. Denn dann würde die Grenze unter Umständen ja wieder an der Nato verlaufen. Der merkt auch, die Russen wollen die Ukraine in genau dem Zustand halten. Am besten Waffenstillstandsabkommen und autonome Republik Ostukraine. Denn dann hat sich das mit dem Natobeitritt.

Um das zu begreifen muss man keine Politikwissenschaftler sein. Man muss nichtmal das Abitur haben, das begreift jeder, der die Situation aufmerksam verfolgt.
Und dennoch labern einige Spezialisten hier immer noch davon, der Putin, der habe das alles von Anfang an geplant. Der wollte das genau so. 

Du merkst nicht mal auf welchem dummen populistischen Niveau du hier argumentierst. Der Putin, der Diktator, der macht das alles ganz alleine, das ist so flach, du glaubst wahrscheinlich auch die Merkel leitet Deutschland. So ein hanebüchener Quatsch.

Unfortunately, it's a pretty complicated process that's not particularly conductive to travel because of the time frame involved.

Here's what you do:

When you arrive in France, gather the materials mentioned and send them to your local OFII. I was able to also just drop them off in person. Eventually they'll send your a letter informing your of your appointment time (which you cannot choose). This appointment should come roughly 2-3 months after they receive your documents. You have to be there at that time, so you can plan for it a little bit, I guess, choosing when to send your stuff--as long as it's within your first three months.

The appointment itself is not too bad, at the end of which you'll receive your registration stamp in your passport and then you are free~!

Proof of accommodation usually means a receipt of rent paid, a bill sent to an address with your name, etc. Obviously you won't have that if you're traveling around. I *think*, if you know someone there, you can bring a combination of their identification + their own proof of accommodation + a signed letter by them saying you live there as proof too.

EDIT: Oops, I wrote this thinking that you already had the visa and were confused on what happens after you arrive. The information is the same, but I guess you'll have to read it as less of a ""how-to"" and more of just what registering entails.

Nach seiner Auffassung galt das Versprechen, die Nato nicht nach Osten zu erweitern. Als der Warschauer Pakt aufgelöst wurde, bestand sogar noch weniger Anlaß dazu als vorher. Dennoch wurde es gemacht.

Heutige Situation in der Ukraine war ""totally predictable"".

Ähnlich wurde es wohl auch vom US-Botschafter in Moskau 2008 gesehen: 

William J. Burns (Moskau 2008): ""Russia would view further eastward expansion as a potential military threat. NATO enlargement, particularly to Ukraine, remains ""an emotional and neuralgic"" issue for Russia, but strategic policy considerations also underlie strong opposition to NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia. In Ukraine, these include fears that the issue **could potentially split the country in two, leading to violence or even, some claim, civil war**, which would force Russia to decide whether to intervene.""

true,shackleton1,EURO,European Union,"There are many people in favour of an English parliament. But the issue is slightly confusing. For a start, the seat of the English parliament is traditionally at Westminster, but that's currently occupied by the British parliament (historically, the English parliament accepted MPs from Scotland; the British parliament is in a sense the English parliament with other bits tacked on). And it could be argued that the British parliament *is* the English parliament. English MPs, if reasonably united, can pass any law they like. Nothing can pass without the support of many English MPs. It's argued by many that Westminster is so English that you don't need a second English parliament. The West Lothian question remains a rather hypothetical scenario; to my knowledge there's no contraversial legislation recently passed where Scottish votes forced it through against the will of English MPs.

I got a bit long and boring there. The tl:dr is that there kind of should be / kind of is an English parliament.

As for flags, it will vary from county to county, but certainly in Kent when a private individual hoists a flag it's more likely to be St George's Cross than the Union Jack.

The tactic was used when criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union, wherein the response would be ""What about..."" followed by the naming of an event in the Western world loosely similar to the original item of criticism.[1][2] It represents a case of tu quoque or the appeal to hypocrisy, a logical fallacy which attempts to discredit the opponent's position by asserting the opponent's failure to act consistently in accordance with that position, without directly refuting or disproving the opponent's initial argument.

*Wie dem auch sei, andere haben bereits aufgezeigt, dass nicht viele Menschen in Deutschland unser föderales System mögen, weil es mehr dazu gedacht scheint unnötige Barrieren zwischen den Ländern aufzubauen, denn sich an regionale Eigenheiten anzupassen. Zumal es Korruption mehr zu fördern als zu verhindern scheint. Das wurde sehr offensichtlich als in meinem Bundesland, Baden-Württemberg, die CDU zum ersten mal seit fast 60 (!) Jahren als Regierungssparei abgelöst wurde.*

*Dennoch frage ich mich oft, ob nicht auch wir, die Wähler, daran Schuld sind. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob das in jeder Ecke Deutschlands der Fall ist, aber hier zumindest scheinen die Menschen nicht wirklich auf die Landespolitik acht zu geben, sie sind viel mehr an der Bundespolitik interessiert, wenn überhaupt. Ohne Bürger, die die Politik im Auge behalten scheint es einfach, dass die Dinge außer Hand geraten. Natürlich kann man das Debakel nicht ganz dem Wähler in die Schuhe schieben, aber ich denke, das wenn wir mehr Acht geben würden das Ganze nicht so schlimm wäre.*

*Etwas anderes, dass mich schon immer genervt hat ist, dass das Subsidiaritätsprinzip zwar auf Bundesebene viel Aufmerksamkeit geniest, man auf Landesebene davon aber noch nie gehört zu haben scheint. Wenn überhaupt, dann haben Städte und Kommunen über die Jahre hinweg mehr Lasten zu ertragen mit weniger Ressourcen. Falls sich also nichts ändern sollten, dann wäre ich dagegen den Ländern mehr Verantwortung auf europäischer Ebene zu übertragen.*

*Kurzum: Ich bin unentschlossen.*

I actually have thought about this more than once, too. With increasing European, integration that would be a logical step. Europe of Regions comes to mind.

However, as others have pointed out, the federal system is not loved very much in Germany, as it tends to not really account for regional differences, but instead seems to raise unnecessary barriers between the different Länder. It seems to foster corruption too. In my Bundesland, Baden-Württemberg this became apparent very much after the CDU was not elected to be the ruling party for the first time in almost 60 (!) years

However, I often ask myself if that's not partially our, the voters, fault. I'm not sure if that's true for every corner of Germany, but a lot of people here do not really keep attention of what's going on on the Land level, but are more interested in the federal politics, if at all. So without people keeping a close eye on what's going on it's easy for things to go out of hand. Of course one cannot attribute it entirely to the voters, but I think if we'd care more it wouldn't be as bad as it is.

Another think that always bothered me is that the concept of subsidiary has been given great attention on the federal level, with the Länder getting more legislative power over the years, but on the Länder level this is basically unheard of. If anything, the Cities and counties have gotten a greater burden but less resources to handle it over the years. So if nothing were to change then I'd definitely be against giving the Länder more power in a EU setting.

I think the states shouldn't have any more national legislative power then the other lower levels of government. An institution like the Bundesrat, where representatives of the states who are sent by the state governments and not elected by the population is undemocratic and only serves the interests of state politicians who want to increase their influence.

I don't necessarily want to eliminate the state level of government, because there are things that are best regulated regionally, but I want to curb their influence, especially on national level. I don't think a centralised government that has to micromanage regional affairs is particularly efficient.

true,WilliamDhalgren,CROA,Croatia,"mostly agreed. only re defense budgets - we could do a lot more with the budgets we've got. Its a matter of building a defense union, for as things stand, we spend collectively a third of what the US does - this is no peanuts. Yet the combined military effectiveness is not one tenth of it. Bunch of duplication of expenses, lots of forces perhaps of use in the case of a replay of the battle of Kursk, but not really effective in contemporary peacekeeping, etc. 

Treaties allow us to do so. I hope this crisis is a wakeup call for this to happen.

Re Iraq, yeah partially it was liberalism at least used to justify the intervention. But there was so much wrong there. What I find totally unacceptable is the disregard for international law. US has never been too keen on following it, since it just ties its hands. But it had no legitimacy in interfering. It could have had it, and it could have had more allies if it choose to try. In the Security Council, sure it would be blocked but its the proper procedure. In the General Assembly next, via uniting for peace procedure. If it can't win that vote, it has no business butting in against the wishes of the government in Iraq. These are liberal objections at core.

Another practical one was apparent lack of any plan of what to do afterwards. If they had a powerful faction to support, like it was in afganistan, at least the blueprint would not consist of mere chaos.

Really whenever I think of that war, I facepalm how amateurishly it seems to have been done.

In Ukrainian case its legally simple since their government would welcome aid and probably intervention. And indeed international law has been broken on multiple counts against them.

I totally agree we need to play this as smart as possible, and think this through.

It is absurd that countries can't control their own fiscal policy and Germany that does control it wants to lecture them for wanting to survive. The EU is guaranteed to fail if they refuse to set up an appropriate way to have transfer payments between countries to spur economies.

1) Even if you assume the worst and say only a third of English people support the EU... that's still 1 in 3 and represents around 20 millions English people.

2) Opinion polls traditionally show support for the EU, but will vary according to what's in the press. But this suggests that at least half of the English people support the EU.

3) It could be argued that only UKIP supports are truly anti-EU. If you were so opposed to the EU, you would vote UKIP, especially in the European elections. Yet UKIP can only achieve a third of the vote. This suggests that two thirds of the English people support the EU.

&gt;America was visibly reluctant to get involved, let alone lead the action. And, having helped to knock out Libya's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes, it pulled back from the front-line operations. But America's role remains essential, not least in providing air-to-air refuelling, as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the European allies.

[**MoD accused of 'bungling' Army cuts**](http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/politics/mod-accused-of-bungling-army-cuts-1.559768)

&gt;Ministers have been accused of putting Britain's military capabilities at risk by ""bungling"" money-saving army reforms.

&gt;------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) criticised the Ministry of Defence (MoD) for failing to consult the head of the Army fully before pushing ahead with deep cuts to regular forces.

&gt;It also gave little consideration to whether it was possible for reservist numbers to be near-doubled by 2019, and it managed to squander millions of pounds through a flawed deal with Capita.

&gt;The verdict, delivered in the cross-party committee's report on the controversial Army 2020 programme, comes as Nato leaders gather in Wales for a key summit.

&gt;The scheme is intended to save more than £10 billion over a decade, by cutting 20,000 personnel from the regular army and increasing reservist strength to 30,000.

&gt;But the National Audit Office (NAO) has suggested that the recruitment target could take six years longer than planned to hit.

Deswegen landest du halt immer im Keller. Ich sehe das eher als Qualitätsmerkmal. Wenn /r/de voll von deinen Klonen wäre, wäre das hier unausstehlich. Deswegen siehst du ja in den Ecken in denen du sonst deine Wahrheiten aufschnappst nur Leute die das gleiche denken. Denk mal darüber nach.

&gt;  Die russische Administration hatte nie ein Problem mit der Ukraine unter Janukowytsch...Absolut inakzeptabel für die russische Administration...Das läuft den Interessen der russischen Administration auch entgegen...Also hat die russische Administration hier ausschließlich ihre Interessen vertreten...

Respekt. Klingt als wäre es von der russischen Administration diktiert worden und diese wollte sicher gehen, daß man auch weiß wer der Urheber ist. 

So viel zur Syntax. Ich hätte da doch einige Fragen zum Inhalt. Warum nochmal muss es die Ukraine interessieren was die russische Administration (nachfolgend: die Alliierten) mag? Das ist ein souveräner Staat. Auch von den Alliierten anerkannt. Er hat Grenzen. Die haben die Alliierten auch mal anerkannt. 

Nun gehen wir davon aus, daß ""die NATO, USA, EU"" (nachfolgend: die Nazis) die Revolution(en) unterstützt hat. Die haben das auf diverse Arten gemacht. Opposition mit Geld, Propaganda, whatever.

Während dessen haben die Alliierten jedoch das gleiche mit der anderen Seite gemacht während diese an der Macht war.

Nun kam es zur Revolution im Land. Die Seite die die Alliierten unterstützt hatten hat verloren. Die Nazis haben gewonnen. 

Nun waren die Alliierten butthurt. Alle die sie unterstützt hatten, hatten nichts mehr in der Hand. Also haben die Alliierten sich entschieden richtig Old School zu werden und das Militär über die Grenzen die sie mal anerkannt haben fahren zu lassen um sich die Mietwohnung zu holen die sie schon immer supi fanden. Sie haben das Haus besetzt so zu sagen. 

Da dachten sich die Nazis: mmmh ok. 

Und weil das so gut geklappt hat, dachten sich die Ukrainer die die Alliierten echt supi finden in einer den Alliierten zugewandten Ecke des Landes, sie machen das auch mal. Nun ging das nicht so gut. Es wurde schon richtig eng. Also schickten die Alliierten wiedermal Militär damit die Nummer doch noch etwas länger läuft.

Findest du das nicht irgendwie unverhältnismäßig? Also man kann ja butthurt sein. Die Alliierten hätten ja mit der Zeit sicher wieder Freunde in der Ukrainischen Regierung gefunden und das alte Spiel wäre weiter gegangen. Aber das Militär? So mit Panzern? Meinst du nicht, daß das etwas übertrieben ist? So n bissl?

NATO. Also soweit ich mich erinnern kann, hatte der letzte der ernsthaft versucht hat die Ukraine in die NATO aufzunehmen danach einige Gesichtsprobleme. Kannst du dich noch erinnern? War in deinen Wahrheitskreisen damals ein riesen Thema. Der Fiese Ruski damals. Die Aufnahme wurde 2008 abgelehnt. Nun ist es 2014. Die Alliierten nagen an den ukrainischen, international anerkannten Grenzen. Also ich würde auch versuchen einer Seite beizutreten die mir helfen könnte bevor das ausartet. Du nicht? Meinst du nicht, daß eine clevere, nicht-militärische Lösung für das Einflussproblem der Alliierten besser gewesen wäre? 

&gt;  Warum? Weil die Nato kein Land aufnehmen wird, welches sich noch in einem Bürgerkrieg oder einem ähnlichen Zustand befindet.

Aber die Nazis haben doch schon 2008 die Ukraine nicht aufgenommen. Da war die Ukraine noch gar nicht im Konflikt. Jetzt im Konflikt stehen aber ihre Chancen viel besser. Heute haben wir schon über die ersten Lieferungen einzelner Nazi Staaten in die Ukraine gehört. Das wäre 2008 noch undenkbar gewesen. 

&gt; Wer auch nur über den geringsten Intellekt verfügt, merkt auch, dass die Russen die Ostukraine nicht an Russland angliedern wollen.

Nochmal kurz...also es ist deiner Meinung nach super einen Konfliktherd aufrecht zu erhalten wo täglich Menschen auf beiden Seiten sterben weil man unfähig war die eigenen außenpolitischen Defizite auf die übliche Art und Weise zu lösen und jetzt nicht das Gesicht verlieren will?

Das ist jetzt irgendwie besser als das was die Nazis gemacht haben? Nach welchen Maßstäben den? 

&gt; Und dennoch labern einige Spezialisten hier immer noch davon, der Putin, der habe das alles von Anfang an geplant.

Hab ich noch nie gehört. Wo?

This is as far as I know in line with the findings of ICTY on the matter - eg http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/icty-uphelds-verdict-for-kosovo-war-crimes

&gt;there was a broad campaign of violence directed against the Kosovo Albanian civilian population conducted by forces under the control of the [Yugoslav] and Serbian authorities, during which there were incidents of killing, sexual assault, and the intentional destruction of mosques”.

&gt; The verdict also said that “it was the deliberate actions of these forces during this campaign that caused the departure of at least 700,000 Kosovo Albanians from Kosovo in the short period of time between the end of March and beginning of June 1999”.

on the other hand, there seems far less guilt established by the court for the kosovar side, with their PM being acquitted:

&gt; http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20536318

ICTY rulings, again, seem to paint a fairly one-sided picture of the Yugoslav wars.

I don't like the fact a uniting for peace resolution was not sought for legitimating the intervention formally. but intervention was both legitimate and necessary.

I think you just answered your own question.

You *can* get by with English-only in Germany, but if you want to have a social life outside of the foreign student population, understand what the packages say in the supermarket, and so on, then knowing the local language really helps.

Also, only a certain share of student slots are reserved for foreign students, so there's an artificial upper limit.

If his decisions were to be incompatible with Russia’s expectations then Putin would see to it that the de Villiers’ business in Russia suffers. This would be very much normal practice of this regime.

Maybe, but you got to understand than in france it's the president (and his gov to advise him) that wears the military pants. He says where when and how much, and the generals figure how to and what's really doable and not. So at best he could sabotage a potential war effort, until the general get caught and quietly pushed on the side (""yellowed"") if anything goes wrong on his part.

Problem with france is that the gov is not very popular right now due to systemic issues (long story shot, Holland was given a country on the verge of stalling) so he really can't start another war openly right now. Serious protests would force him to resign. So not a lot will get done on that side, and unless the ship find another buyer willing to shoulder the brunt of the cost, it's not going to stop :-/.

&gt; The international ‘No Mistrals For Putin’ campaign, coordinated from France, is advocating a sale of the ships to the European Union or NATO to avoid France suffering the full brunt of the aborted deal.

The catacombs (illegal part I'm assuming) is continuously getting dirtier and dirtier due to the increase of people, therefore regular people who go there hate ""tourists"" (that's what they are called) who don't do any work themselves to find the entrances etc and just ask publicly for access. 

Why are they hated? Because alot don't care about the place, they saw it in a video/movie and think wow it's cool place I wanna go down there, and then people leave their shit behind and it's disgusting.

Because they don't go equipped for it: it's pitch black, low ceiling in alot of places, some places aren't very stable, some access points have 25m slippery ladders, huge maze so if you don't know the place you can just get lost (you will likely end up finding someone after a while but still). This leads to cataphiles having to help out people who are lost or out of water etc and it's pain + if friends on the surface or w/e don't see you come out in time then it leads to the police being involved and then maybe the media and then this leads to a campaign of access closures.

Going down through manholes which weigh up to 130+ kg is not a simple task and if you don't know the technique you can either fuck yourself up or fuck up the manhole which makes it dangerous for people on the sidewalk, underneath and which will lead to the certain closure of that access. Going out is just as tedious and without the proper technique you can really hurt your back (I know this first handed)

If you do go underground by yourself or with someone you met who isn't very familiar you might scare youself because cataphiles have some ""games"" among themselves which consists in throwing homemade smoke grenades in places to confuse others and make them feel lost, normally people know the place well and take it as a sort of challenge to navigate through it. Also you should know some people who really dislike ""tourists"" will steal and burn your map if they see it in your hands while you walk (also experienced this) so once again don't go down alone.


If despite all this you are certain you want to go then this is 100% not the place to look for info and please refrain from asking in public forums again since it leads to closures of access since more people know about them and use them improperly. Don't be lazy and do the digging yourself, you will be more accepted in the community which is pretty closed to newcomers and you will at least have the satisfaction of having found the solutions yourself",0,1410122732,null,0,false,0,ckbvhzb,t3_2fqknl,t1_ckbvhzb,t3_2fqknl,null,1427140233,20,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,20

At the moment it feels like it is run like a company. Very important positions, such as the recent ""election"" of Juncker really cause people a lot of issues. President should be voted on, or they should drop the image of pretending to be a representative government.

It really is all just about cultural perception; Americans think it sounds angry because most of the German they've heard has been in Hitler speeches.

&gt;I think that a description of any loud, stirring, tumultuous episode must be tamer in German than in English. Our descriptive words of this character have such a deep, strong, resonant sound, while their German equivalents do seem so thin and mild and energyless. Boom, burst, crash, roar, storm, bellow, blow, thunder, explosion; howl, cry, shout, yell, groan; battle, hell. These are magnificent words; the have a force and magnitude of sound befitting the things which they describe. But their German equivalents would be ever so nice to sing the children to sleep with, or else my awe-inspiring ears were made for display and not for superior usefulness in analyzing sounds. Would any man want to die in a battle which was called by so tame a term as a Schlacht? Or would not a consumptive feel too much bundled up, who was about to go out, in a shirt-collar and a seal-ring, into a storm which the bird-song word Gewitter was employed to describe? And observe the strongest of the several German equivalents for explosion -- Ausbruch. Our word Toothbrush is more powerful than that. It seems to me that the Germans could do worse than import it into their language to describe particularly tremendous explosions with. The German word for hell -- Hölle -- sounds more like helly than anything else; therefore, how necessary chipper, frivolous, and unimpressive it is. If a man were told in German to go there, could he really rise to thee dignity of feeling insulted?

&gt;There are some German words which are singularly and powerfully effective. For instance, those which describe lowly, peaceful, and affectionate home life; those which deal with love, in any and all forms, from mere kindly feeling and honest good will toward the passing stranger, clear up to courtship; those which deal with outdoor Nature, in its softest and loveliest aspects -- with meadows and forests, and birds and flowers, the fragrance and sunshine of summer, and the moonlight of peaceful winter nights; in a word, those which deal with any and all forms of rest, repose, and peace; those also which deal with the creatures and marvels of fairyland; and lastly and chiefly, in those words which express pathos, is the language surpassingly rich and affective. There are German songs which can make a stranger to the language cry. That shows that the sound of the words is correct -- it interprets the meanings with truth and with exactness; and so the ear is informed, and through the ear, the heart.",0,1410124083,null,0,1410131896,0,ckbw7ig,t3_2fpebd,t1_ckbw7ig,t3_2fpebd,null,1427139640,5,false,German,t5_2qq51,5

And please don't lecture me on being British.  Your logic is insinuating that Northern Irish people should be called British and are not Irish.  The British empire started through the union of our 2 countries on the island of Britain, and since the empire reached it's peak and dissolved throughout that time, finally leaving just 4 territories in the aftermath, including the original two, it follows that the 'British' identity either lives on through a social union between Scotland and England, or it dies altogether.  The English don't have a monopoly on Britain, since Scotland contributed just as much to that legacy.  That, and the fact that the Union Jack wouldn't look so pretty without the Saltire. 

I have no problem being identified as Scottish, in fact I welcome it more than I do being British.. but for many Scot's here, being British is more important than their Scottish identity, so to try and take that away from them and use it exclusively for England because of a political break up is demoralising and a tad insulting considering the effort the Scots put into the creation of the identity.

true,metroxed,EUSK,Basque Country,"Well, I'm personally in favour of Basque independence; I actively support it and I vote accordingly. I really hope I can see an independent Basque Country within my lifetime, and I believe we, the Basques, are getting closer and closer to that goal, but we still have a very long road ahead of us. 

I'm glad Bilbao impressed you, I hope it was in a positive way, most visitors normally are. The rest of the country is just as impressive. *Nationalist* can be a very loaded word, but here actually most people use it; within the Basque Country it is normally used to refer to the Basque Nationalist Party (center-right), while *Patriotic* is generally used for the other pro-independence party EH Bildu (left). So both terms are correct. Spaniards just use ""nationalists"" when talking about Basque independence supporters. 

Basque people are very patriotic, yes, and we really have a feeling of strong attachment to our land, traditions, and especially, to our language. Much spins around the Basque language, and how important it is to improve its condition. Not all Basques want independence, but I daresay that even those who do not want it are still very attached to their Basque roots, and many prefer to be called Basques before than Spanish or French. 

The Basque Country is in many senses as different from the rest of Spanish regions as these ones also are between each other, but in many other senses we're even more different still. We live in the northernmost fringe of the peninsula, surrounded by mountains, and for centuries we've avoided external influences. Unlike the rest of Spaniards, we were originally neither Iberians nor Celts: we were Basques from the beginning and we spoke Basque since records exist. We avoided early Romanisation for the most part and we were not invaded by the Moors. Our language, who is not Indo-European like the languages of our neighbors, endured and is still alive and healthy today, thanks to our will, as both Spanish and French have tried to suppress it. We have different customs and traditions, different vernacular architecture, and very different landscapes given our different climate (in contrast to most of Spain, which is yellow-ish and arid, we are very green, humid and rainy). We are Atlantic people, not Mediterranean.

In recent use, no-fly zone in Iraq was setup under that same notion, despite lacking UN authorization and explicit calls by the UN of it as being illegal. This, operation Provide Comfort and not Kosovo was the recent precedent actually.

Scotland, Catalonia, Basque and possibly Crimea - apart from the procedure not followed - are somewhat like Kosovo but quite different from say Lughans, Donetsk, Transnistria, N Ossetia, Abkhazia, or say N Cyprus - and the latter all quite clearly illegal under international law, due to foreign involvement/irridentist character, and unlike a true domicile secessionist movement as in Kosovo and the rest, which are neither obliging nor prohibited, but a political struggle. And if you look at the dates on these places, you'll see this certainly didn't start with Kosovo.

Ha veramente la stoffa per diventare una grande scrittrice e, al giorno d'oggi, non lo considero un complimento.
Il contenuto è a dir poco vuoto e inconcludente, mi sembra di sentire un monologo di Bergonzoni; L'unica cosa che ti viene fuori da un'articolo del genere è un gigantesco **e quindi?**.

Non esprime pareri, giudizi, consigli o stati d'animo che non siano quelli degni del miglior populismo renziano. Una [sofista](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofisma) . 

Per non parlare del classismo becero che traspare da tutto il post: ""i brutti e cattivi via, i belli e simpatici amici miei"". Per poi arrivare a quella che secondo me è l'apoteosi dell'ignoranza, che cito testualmente:

&gt;Mamma vi spiega Pitloo. Così vi affezionate al bello e il brutto imparate a schifarlo. Mai accettarlo, mai metabolizzarlo.

Questa frase (e le precedenti 3 righe) è aberrante. E' quanto di più classista, ignorante, e ottuso una persona possa dire e, ponendolo nella chiosa del suo articolo, non fa altro che racchiudervi il significato ultimo di tutto il suo ragionamento. Neanche [Enzo Miccio e Carla Gozzi](http://www.woolite.it/life-blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Enzo-Miccio-e-Carla-Gozzi.jpeg) saprebbero fare di meglio.

*Il bello* è quello che durante una vita di esperienze tu inquadri come bello.

*Il bello* cambia infinite volte nel corso della vita.

*Il bello* è un concetto talmente soggettivo che dovrebbe essere vietato frapporvi l'articolo determinativo.

E sopratutto *il bello* non può e non deve essere insegnato, è proprio qui l'errore più grande.

^(e tra l'altro a me Pitloo fa cagare.)

Proviamo a girare la medaglia:

&gt;Mamma vi spiega come si fanno i soldi. Così vi ci affezionate e capite che se non ci sono bisogna andarli a rubare così non avete neanche più bisogno di lavorare e chi si fa il mazzo dalla mattina alla sera è fesso e dovete schifarlo.

Stessa metodologia, due punti di vista differenti.
Proprio questo è il cancro di Napoli, altro che istituzioni, poliziotti, ignoranza e bellezza. 

e per concludere credo che non si può fare di pochi casi isolati una generalizzazione su una città che conta quasi 2M di abitanti. 

è questo più di tutto che mi fa girare le palle.

[**France and Britain Lead Military Push on Libya**](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/19/world/africa/19europe.html)

&gt;PARIS — France and Britain continued to press their hawkish position on Libya on Friday, saying they intend to take the lead in enforcing a no-flight zone.

&gt;Both countries, the most adamant backers of the United Nations Security Council resolution to authorize military action in Libya, also pointed to the passage of the measure on Thursday as an important — if rare — example of European resolve.

[**US reluctant to intervene militarily in Libya**](http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/africa/us-reluctant-to-intervene-militarily-in-libya)

&gt;WASHINGTON // After a rapid diplomatic response to the violence in Libya, the US government's momentum has ground to a halt over direct military intervention.

&gt;The US appears especially reluctant to engage its military in yet another Muslim country, not least because of the disastrous miscalculations that accompanied the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Indeed, in a speech last week to the United States Military Academy at West Point, Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, appeared to rule out any major US military engagement in Libya.

[**How Libya Became a French and British War**](http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2060412,00.html)

&gt;As the military action against Libya to give teeth to U.N. Security Council resolution 1973 began, one question kept nagging away: Why, precisely, were the governments of Britain and France in the lead? Why were their armed forces taking part in the military action, and why had their diplomats done the grunt work in the negotiations that led to adoption of the resolution?

[**Obama trying to limit military involvement in Libya**](http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/03/18/obama.no.fly/)

&gt;Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama is trying to limit the United States' role in enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya to support aircraft only and is very reluctant to commit any offensive U.S. firepower, a senior U.S. official familiar with the military planning discussions said Friday.

&gt;America was visibly reluctant to get involved, let alone lead the action. And, having helped to knock out Libya's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes, it pulled back from the front-line operations. But America's role remains essential, not least in providing air-to-air refuelling, as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the European allies. 

[**France recognises Syrian council, proposes military intervention**](http://euobserver.com/defence/114380)

&gt;BRUSSELS - In a direct echo of previous events in Libya, France has formally recoginsed the opposition Syrian National Council and proposed that international troops should protect civilians.

&gt;French foreign minister Alain Juppe signalled the change in policy at a high-profile meeting with SNC leader Burhan Ghalioun in Paris on Wednesday (23 November).

[**France Leads the Charge for Military Intervention in Syria**](http://www.thewire.com/global/2012/08/france-leads-charge-military-intervention-syria/56152/)

&gt;It feels like déjà vu all over again: France, which led the charge for military intervention in Libya last year, is now backing a partial no-fly zone in Syria—a step that would for all practical purposes amount to a declaration of war. 

&gt;Last night, France's Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian ""urged the international community to consider backing a no-fly zone over parts of Syria,"" reports The Associated Press' Bassem Mroue, telling France 24 TV that Paris would help implement a full no-fly zone ""if it followed international legal principles."" As Reuters' John Irish reports, Le Drian's statement marks ""the first time a senior French official had suggested that an 'international coalition,' rather than the United Nations, could intervene in Syria."" Peculiarly, Le Drian advocated a ""partial"" no-fly zone instead of a full one, saying that shutting down Syria's entire air space would be tantamount to ""going to war.""

&gt;GENEVA — The United States and Russia reached a sweeping agreement on Saturday that called for Syria’s arsenal of chemical weapons to be removed or destroyed by the middle of 2014 and indefinitely stalled the prospect of American airstrikes.

&gt;The joint announcement, on the third day of intensive talks in Geneva, also set the stage for one of the most challenging undertakings in the history of arms control.

Lei invece sembra completamente alla deriva, disinteressata, stanca, in preda all'*ennui*.

Instead off playing on ""loan rates"" that only affect banks and their friends, give cash to the end user. It's the only way to ensure it actually reach them. Otherwise, it's like trying to give cash and foreign aid to an african warlord and hope it'll be used appropriately. 

The entire financial system is hilariously corrupt and only exist to line it's pockets (whether it's fees, costs, card cost, ""banking incidents"", etc etc. capitalism, ho). If you give *them* cash they'll just put it in benefits and no citizens that isn't already rich will see any of it ever. It can't be relied upon much longer, imho.

&gt; Many in the private sector don’t want to take out any more loans; they believe their debt levels are already too high.

No, it's not that they have ""too many debts"" . It's just that if you are not sure whether you will still have a job in 2 months from now, look at 300€ in savings because minimal wage only pay the rent/utilities, and think your employer might fuck you over your next paycheck, you don't take a loan for 500'000 EUR at 20% interest for a house.

&gt; Most economists agree that cash transfers from a central bank would stimulate demand. But policymakers nonetheless continue to resist the notion.

Well, of course, the first world economy is led by the US, of which the senate is bribed to death by billionaires to ensure that never happend. Oh sorry they call it a ""campaign contribution"" so that changes *everything*. /s

&gt; Other critics warn that such helicopter drops could cause inflation

Unlike money printed forever to make it rain on big oil and such corporations ""subsidized"". /s  PS : Europe is already in *deflation*.

&gt; By depositing the funds directly into millions of individual accounts -- spurring spending immediately -- central bankers wouldn’t need to print quantities of money equivalent to 20 percent of GDP.

This.

&gt;  Around $29 trillion in offshore assets already lies beyond the reach of state treasuries

Officially. I heard real numbers around 240 however (beyond the entire west's hands).

Cependant, tu ne risques pas grand chose. S'ils te virent, tu pourras demander requalification de ton temps de travail en CDI, et exiger le réemploi, ou plus probablement des indemnités pour licenciement abusif. C'est juste relou d'avoir à passer devant les prud'hommes pour ça.

Pour te protéger, tu peux établir des factures citant clairement l'activité que tu mènes, et rédiger des emails pseudo-naifs en montrant bien l'existance d'un lien de subordination.

Au niveau de la rémunération, pour toi, si vous êtes d'accord sur le montant brut, tout va bien. Il faudra simplement que le montant brut que tu aurais eu en CDI soit majoré de ce que tu auras à payer en charges (+20%), ainsi que de quoi te couvrir avec une mutuelle et une assurance.

Ich denke, dynamische Modelle werden in der Zukunft mehr Beachtung in der VWL finden. Anders als die Experten im Text glaube ich, dass die Lehre jedoch in absehbarer Zeit zumindest teilweise revolutioniert wird. Ich werde das, als Student, nicht mehr mitbekommen, aber man lernt ja das ganze Leben lang. Die meisten Professoren sind auch keine ""Ewiggestrigen"" und haben die Problematik schon lange vor der Medien erkannt.

Mais les Français choisissent la classe politique. Je ne me l'explique pas, à part peut-être par les forts taux d'abtensions qui, j'en suis certain, voteraient contre la classe politique établie, s'ils votaient seulement.

I don't think you remember what you read then :

The start of the war in Europe is generally held to be 1 September 1939, beginning with the German invasion of Poland; Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later.

When exactly did the US declare war ?

Was France occupied at the time ?

That's a fact : France and Great Britain declared war to defend another country, when the US went to war only when they were attacked. They simply did not care enough that France was invaded and Britain bombed to declare war. What a great fucking altruism !

On a recent afternoon, artisans were perched on the scaffolding that surrounds the ancient structure, using water sprays and lime in their painstaking work. Before and after segments of the Colosseum already show a dramatic change — from soot-stained rock, its color is being transformed to a pale oatmeal more closely resembling its appearance when ancient Romans gathered for bloodsport.


&gt;But the contract struck with Tod’s president, billionaire Diego Della Valle, has provoked the ire of a local citizens group, which claims it was too generous. For a limited time, Tod’s will have the right to put its logo on hundreds of thousands of Colosseum tickets sold each year. It also won the right to associate its brand with the Colosseum’s restoration in promotional material for up to 15 years.

From a Russian perspective, we are sort of squaring off and being all menacing-like. After all, Russia the reason NATO exists. In terms of this conflict, we *do* share some of the blame.

That said, Russia didn't have to invade and annex Ukrainian territory as a result of our alliance growing stronger. He could have responded by getting bases in Serbia or Cuba and stocking them menacingly (tit for tat). Instead, he decided to escalate it to the point of no return.

Pourquoi tu les ressors si tu ne veux pas en parler alors ?

&gt;A ce que je vois ce président a été élu démocratiquement et Poutine l'a reconnu.

Il y a eu un putsch avant son élection, ça ne t'aura pas échappé.

&gt;Comment qu'il pense être la sienne... se sont ses citoyens...

Raison de plus pour ne pas les bombarder.

&gt;ils ont été les premiers a prendre les armes

Nope, les premiers à prendre les armés de manière illégitime étaient les milices d'extrême-droite durant Maïdan. On pourrait parler des snipers [dont on sait maintenant qu'ils ont autant tué de policiers que de manifestants...](http://blogs.mediapart.fr/blog/xipetotec/060314/reussir-un-coup-detat-les-snipers-deuromaidan-tiraient-sur-les-deux-camps)

Donc non, les premiers à prendre les armes n'étaient pas les séparatistes.

&gt;La guerre malheureusement fait des dommages comparativement a Assad ou d'autres insurrections le coût chez Kiev est minime.

Contrairement à Assad les séparatistes ne massacrent pas la population. Par contre, [les pro-UE ne se gênent pas pour brûler vif des dizaines de séparatistes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BEpOT6_nOU). Dommage collatéral ?

&gt;Par hasard te souviens-tu des actions de Poutine a Grozny

Les actions de Poutine sur la population à Grozny sont critiquables et je ne les soutiens pas.  Tout comme j'imagine que tu ne soutiens pas les actions des États-Unis en Irak, avec à la clé des centaines de milliers de morts sur la base d'un mensonge à la communauté internationale.

&gt;Elle n'a jamais pourtant réfuté ses propos.??

Dire ""je partage des valeurs communes avec Poutine"", c'est être pro-Poutine ? Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire être ""pro-Poutine"" selon toi ?

Le monde se divise entre pro-Poutines, qui seraient forcément d'accord avec tout ce que dit ou fait Poutine, et les anti-Poutine, qui seraient forcément en désaccord avec Poutine sur tout ?

&gt;quel interview dans la rue..

Les propos ont été recueillis dans la rue.

&gt;Kurier est le deuxième plus gros quotiden autrichien et la ligne du journal est très conservateur la traduction est très exacte?

Le Figaro est le deuxième quotidien français et ça ne l'empêche pas d'être malhonnête sur bon nombre de sujets, sa ligne est également conservatrice.

&gt;je me fiche de son opinion sur Trierweiler(Ton lien) 

Je t'ai mis le passage sur Poutine.

""Je n'ai aucune soumission à l'égard de Poutine"". ""Je n'ai aucune fascination"" (pour Poutine).

&gt;Cette ligne politique donne un aperçu de la future ligne étrangère que se parti a.

Pas vraiment, c'est la ligne Chauprade qui est contestée. Le FN est un parti dans lequel le débat d'idées est constant et les lignes évoluent et s'adaptent. Il faut être débile pour ne pas voir que les rapports de force internationaux sont en constante évolution et on ne saurait dire que cette ligne sera celle qui sera appliquée. Il n'y a qu'à voir les réactions qu'il y a eu suite à la diffusion de la tribune de Chauprade pour s'en rendre compte.

&gt;Sa entre directement en contradiction avec ce que tu as écrit dans ton premier message.

Ça ne rentre pas en contradiction avec ma position qui est pro-France. Et c'est tout ce qui m'importe. Et dans le monde réel où il n'existe pas de parti qui défend 100% de toutes mes idées. Il faut choisir le plus grand commun dénominateur.

Dans le cas spécifique du FN, il y a deux lignes principales : une ligne dite ""Philippot"", sociale et néo-gaulliste (donc en particulier plus sévère avec Israël qu'avec les pays musulmans et islamo-compatible), et une ligne dite ""Chauprade"", qui juge que l'on est dans un conflit de civilisation, avec comme ennemi principal le fondamentalisme islamique sunnite.

I understand conservatives' proposal that if jobs and reindustrialization are to come back, you will have to make your country more ""competitive"" (break unions, privatize, lower taxes). So in your view working classes have two options: continue to demand higher wages and better standards of living and suffer unemployment and deindustrialization or accept lowering of wages and breaking of unions and get jobs and attract capital to your country. What kind of choice is this? Think outside the box a little. Why do we have an economy and millions of people's livelihoods dominated by the profit-motive of a small minority of people in the world who own the productive capital needed to sustain communities. It's time to start looking for alternatives or it will be decades of stagnation and decay to look forward to.

By the way you European conservatives need to stop looking to the USA as someone to look up to. Yes we have gone full neoliberalism over the past 30 years here (which is what you guys want there) and I want you to come here and talk to the avg. worker and see how they are faring.

5,3 millions immigrants lived in France in 2008. There's 200 000 new immigrants each year. 43% of them come from Africa. Overall there was 12 millions immigrants and children of immigrants living in France in 2008. Immigration from Sub-Saharan Africa has increased by 44 points between 1999 and 2008.

Is that massive enough for you ?

edit :

Meanwhile, the number of French nationals living outside France has grown substantially over the past decade, increasing by over 60% since 2000 at an average annual growth rate of 4%. Today, close on 1,611,054 million French nationals are registered as living abroad.

[Source](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_en_France#Origine_g.C3.A9ographique) and [source](http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-overseas/). All data comes from governmental studies.

The definition of immigrant used is ""person born foreigner in a foreign country"". This definition is stricter than usual definition of immigrant (person who was born in a foreign country).

edit2 : I'm putting all the data from different conversations in this post, for later use

You can't compare immigrants from Asia and immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa. Studies show that they have very different backgrounds when it comes to [marrying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage#Current_status), having children and [educating](http://www.ined.fr/fichier/t_telechargement/63608/telechargement_fichier_fr_insee.r.f.rences.pdf) them. People from Asia and OECD countries score higher in school and integrate well (low unemployment and high mixed marriages), whereas people from Maghreb, Turkey and some parts of Africa have low school results, live in closed communities with many children.

This leads to very different results when it comes to [the cost of immigration](http://www.oecd.org/els/mig/imo2013.htm) : immigrants benefit OECD countries, except Germany and France, where they cost 0,52% of GDP each year (see ""fiscal impact"" table).

What we need is a highly educated or rich immigration, at least to make up for the departures of our brains. 

We do not need poor and uneducated immigration, that cannot find a job with our 14,7% unemployment rate (only 54% of non-EU immigrants actually work, and only 15% of immigrants come to France for a job).

Remember that population in France was 28 millions in 1800, 38 millions en 1900, and 65,7 millions in 2014. In the US, it was 3 millions in 1800, 75 millions in 1900, and 314 millions in 2014. For Australia it was 5200 in 1800, 4 millions in 1900 and 22,7 millions in 2014.

From my understanding of them, Russia is a country that suffers from, what is essentially, ""Great Power Syndrome"". They feel a need to assert their authority, interests, and influence. If we stop taking that seriously, they'll escalate the issue. And from Russia's point of view, Ukraine is;

1. In their sphere of influence

2. A country of major strategic importance

3. A country with close historical ties

4. A long time objective of western powers

So it was imperative that they couldn't let it get out of their hands, and when we stopped taking those things seriously, Russia made it serious.

When Russia defaulted in 1998(Because it took on all the debts of the former SSRs and couldn't handle it, people like to forget that little fact) under Yeltsin's government, it was legitimately on the verge of splintering *again*. 

The country was about to become a non-country. There was no middle class, the people were destitute... Putin's reign reversed that trend. 

And a lot of people seem to forget that, when the choice is between a crazy as fuck ultranationalist who says he wants ""Russia to wash its feet in the Indian Ocean"" and the same Communist Party that ruled the USSR, Putin looks pretty damn attractive in comparison. 

Russia itself has never experienced liberal democracy. 18% of the people are concerned with the corruption of the judiciary. 57% would rather a strong leader to a democratically elected one. 32% are worried about the democratic deficit(Note: These figures I heard from analysts on the radio).

true,MartelFirst,IDF,Ile-de-France,"Je suis Franco-Américain, binational, ayant un parent de chaque pays, bien que je suis né et j'ai toujours vécu en France, je dirai que par mon éducation j'ai une double culture. 

Ce dont tu parles c'est le sentiment antifrançais aux USA. Bref, le thread que t'as mis en lien est à moitié composé de blagueurs, et l'autre moitié d'américains qui pour des raisons de grande propagande anti-française subie toute leur vie sont absolument certains que la France ne vaut pas un clou et que c'est un pays de merde habité par des lâches connards. Par exemple, il m'arrive de temps à autres de devoir expliquer à des américains que la France n'a pas perdu la Première Guerre Mondiale, et était au contraire un des si ce n'est le principal vainqueur de la Grande Guerre. Et j'ai beau appuyer ça par des faits historiques basiques largement à la disposition de tout le monde, ces américains anti-français ne veulent rien entendre et restent sur leur position préétablie. Toute défense de la France contre ces délires est alors perçue par eux comme une validation de leurs préjugés : même si mes commentaires sont tout à fait raisonnables, je me fais inexorablement insulté de typique français avec des illusions de grandeur. 

Le sentiment anti-français aux USA provient de divers sources, qui selon moi sont les suivants. 

Premièrement, la France depuis De Gaulle possède une position relativement atypique dans le monde occidental ; les gouvernements successifs ont souvent tenu à défendre une politique extérieure indépendante. Bien que nous étions alignés avec les USA en tant qu'alliés, nous jouions, plus que d'autres occidentaux, nos propres intérêts, parfois en conflit avec les souhaits des américains. Dès lors, certains gouvernements américains étaient mécontents de la France, et cette attitude envers nous s'est répandue chez certains de la population. Certains américains considéraient alors qu'on ne les aimaient pas, parce qu'on ne leur léchaient pas le cul à longueur de temps, et donc ironiquement ils nous aiment pas parce qu'ils pensent qu'on ne les aime pas (ce qui selon moi est faux). 

Deuxièmement, la culture française est perçue comme élitiste. Les américains ne connaissent pas la bonne vieille nourriture populaire française composée de pâtés de campagne et de travers de porc. Pour eux, la nourriture française c'est le luxe et le snobisme. A tel point que tout ce qui est nourriture française, même ce qui est pourtant pour nous très populaire ou basique, comme la baguette voir l'escargot, est considéré comme de la grande cuisine sophistiquée. Bref, personne n'aime le snobbisme. On n'est pas aidés par le fait qu'il n'y a pas énormément d'américains d'origine française, sauf dans le Nord-Est des USA, et un peu en Louisiane. Les influences culturelles de la France sur les USA sont limitées. La France est connue pour son luxe dans le monde, donc pour eux les français sont snobs et arrogants. Donc une seconde ironie est que les Américains considèrent qu'on se croit supérieur aux autres.

Troisièmement. On pourrait se dire que le deuxième point serait brisé lorsque les américains rencontrent des français. Mais au lieu, leurs préjugés sont parfois validés puisque souvent ils nous trouvent snobs ou impolis. Ceci est dû selon moi à une mécompréhension culturelle. Les français sont très réservés, très formels envers ceux qu'ils ne connaissent pas. Pas par impolitesse, au contraire, par politesse justement! La politesse est très importante pour nous, donc lorsqu'un touriste n'est pas au courant des bonnes mœurs française (comme dire ""bonjour"" dès qu'on s'adresse à quelqu'un), on se sent insultés et on risque de ne pas retourner de l'amabilité. A l'inverse, pour nous les américains sont ""faux"", ils sont trop aimables alors qu'en fait ils s'en fichent. Au fond, c'est du lost in translation. Aussi, la plupart des américains se contentent de visiter Paris lorsqu'ils visitent la France, et naturellement Paris est une grande métropole très dense et moins aimable que le reste du pays.

Quatrièmement, on est perçus comme socialisants, chose qui déplait aux Américains de droite.

Enfin, et le sentiment anti-français actuel dérive principalement de ça. Ça rejoint le premier point : le refus de la France de soutenir l'invasion US de l'Iraq. Toutes les insultes de lâcheté ont pris de l'importance après ça. On a osé être en désaccord avec les USA, alors qu'ils nous avaient ""sauvés pendant la 2nd guerre mondiale"".. Freedom fries et j'en passe. La haine viscérale de certains américains pour la France était massive. Pour ceux qui s'en souviennent, c'était assez dingue. 

Je dirais que les américains qui ne sont pas cons ne sont en général pas anti-français. Il sont indifférents au pire.

true,Arvendilin,GERM,Germany,"I have heard the poles talking about how germany is trying to lead Europe too much (eventhough we actually aren't our population just didn't want to just throw money at southern states without any guarantee to get it back, and honestly there was no big chance of getting that money ever back, private investor had even less reason to invest money there, thats one of the reasons germany wanted the reform to make sure people can get their money back and therefor loan their money).

Other nations, and especially populations have also constantly complained that germany is leading too much, and not in a: Oh you yourself dont spend enough money on your military why do you lead kinda way! No it was more like: The germans are trying to take us all over again, kinda way...

After this world cup I have heard from friends in other countries that they felt uneasy (some even threatened) by the site of thousands of germans standing in a giant square chanting and cheering.

Our history haunts us, germans feel that we shouldn't lead in any way, it is deeply ingrained in our current culture.

Imagine, ever since you were a young child you are beeing told about the atrocities and how germany should never be in a leading positiong, heck even our word for leader (führer) is fucked up, until recently germany was never supposed to actually lead.

Also I wouldn't say that germany only cares about itself, its more of a doesn't try to harm itself.

For example as part of the EU germany pays the most money to support smaller states (figures in milliarden €, which is billion in english not million http://www.kinderleicht.brandenburg.de/media_fast/lbm1.a.3726.de/file/Geber-Nehmerl%C3%A4nder.jpg) the countries on top are the countries giving money, the countries down below are countries receiving money, this has been in place for longer than the econmoical crisis btw.

Also germany paid the most during the economical crisis, if germany only acted in its self interest it would have paid less actually, not no money ofcourse that would have been stupid, but it is good for germany to keep the other economies barely working, so they can pay but not really produce/compete.

Also we still pay Israel a lot of money, and still support them a lot, eventhough there have been concerns about a few actions of them, you can't say ohh thats good because of your history you should do that, and then say but when it comes to other stuff you should forget about your history you idiots.

But as I said germany doesn't want ot harm itself, examples for that would be the reforms to the south, not just trying to throw money into a corrupt system where it will have little effects...

Or russia, if we get to even worse conditions with them we might loose our natural gas whihc is still kinda really important in germany (we are working on it) but thats not only us, Finnland iirc uses nearly 100% gas for heating, if they don't get their gas from Russia they freeze to death.

Also 2 things I wanted to clear up: Germany isn't actually the true big leader in the EU, we are the most underrepresented country (not saying thats a bad thing thats how these things work, but its a fact) we got as many people there as France, and we have like 20 million bigger population, we can EASILY be overturned when it comes to policies and voting.

Also, during the cold war we were at the 2%, after that we had unification to deal with (which I don't think any other country in the EU could have done as good as us), and there was no GIANT threat at the time so we tried to spend that money in better, smarter places helping our brothers recover from communism.

If the current situation stays the same (which I think it probably will, eventhough in winter Russian people might have a food problem and its unsure how they will react to the sanctions), there is a good possibility for germany to get a bigger military.

It is just that Merkel treads really carefully (which I quite like, you can really see the physicist in her, looking at everything, analyzing all the different options and then after some time coming to a desicive conclusion instead of impulsive emotional overreactions, its something i really like about her eventhough ill never vote for her party), but I think thats overall good, for germany there are basically landmines everywhere so better be slow and carefull and do it right, I don't think we handled the situation up till now poorly at all, there is not much different that we should have done!",0,1410148147,null,0,false,0,ckc732u,t3_2fpyef,t1_ckc732u,t1_ckbxxmo,null,1427132012,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,MauvaisConseil,FRAN,France,"&gt; I think many of the problems you're talking about are more to do with ghettoization and poverty more than anything else.

Well, immigration from Vietnam and China was also very poor and lived in the same places than immigration from Africa. I strongly believe in cultural differences aggravating social conditions. But it's sure that poverty and ghettoisation have an important influence, data show that there are other factors because some have low unemployment and get richer where others stay poor and unemployed.

&gt;And if you think that immigrants from Asia don't bring problems with them as well, you're mistaken.

When French speak about Asia, we mean China and south-east Asia :)

Immigration from other parts of Asia is not very important in France.

It is true that there are some specific problems, but still what I've said about marriage and education difference stands.

Not so much according to wikipedia : about 80 000 Pakistanis + Iraqis, Afghanistan is not listed in the top 40 countries.

The 9 billion Euros were just to show that its not like only germany benefits of the Euro, if you look for example at west poland, I would say they have improved immensly, thanks in part to all the money that gets send there for improvement of infrastructure etc.

Also, overall federal spending in germany (and I do note that we overall had a deficit that year) was 310 billion, so it was about 3% of the spending of our federal government that year, soo it actually quite a bit if you think about it.


Most countries are under the 2%, again there was no giant threat to the western world as there used to be with the UdSSR which the NATO was kinda build to oppose, also again reunification was really really expensive, it was an increase in 2/5 of the landmass, and those 2/5 were not competitiv on an international level and economically in trouble, we invested a lot in companys and infrastructure to make east germany competitiv (and up to this day the wages in east germany are still lower than in west germany).

Germany doesn't have more seats because thats how a federal system works, the most populated parts are always underrepresented (maybe not as much as with germany but generally they are atleast a bit), also when you look at how people in countries are reacting to germany right now, imagine how they would react if we had about 30% more votes within the EU?

The EU was made to integrate germany into europe and to make it impossible for germany, hell every other nation to gain too much influence and be able to start a war again, so why would you then give germany too much influence? Also back then people were even more afraid of germany.

It personally is no problem for me, there is still a lot of things I can be proud of, I just realize reality and see that there have been a lot of mistakes made in the past that we shouldn't do again and should also never forget so that they can never happen again.

Overly nationalistic/patriotic stuff in general is stuff I don't really like, nationalism is creating the feeling of belonging, the feeling of an US by creating a THEM, we distance us from THEM so we feel closer together and look down on THEM that can lead to some really bad things. 

The example for that would be the german-french relationships in the early 19th century (including the common views that people from one country had about people from another country), that lead to some really ugly things, or look at basically every european country during the 19th century, it good really really extreme at the end.

And yes at that time germany wasn't a nation, but they were still nationalistic, there it was a cultural nationalism, compared to that the french which had something called civic nationalism (stemming from the french revolution, they were all part of one nation which is where their nationalism came from, the german one stems from the same language and the same culture, since they had no state), I hope I use the right words, I kinda translated the german words we have for it to english as good as possible.

Well, *I* don't because it's a pointless bureaucratic exercise that doesn't benefit me unless I want to be a ""Beamte"" (which I don't). Thanks to Germany's antiquated laws it means also giving up my British citizenship which then has implications regarding such things as which inheritance laws and taxes apply if I or a family member back in Britain should die (for instance, if I were to inherit property in Britain). I would also then be required to have (and *pay* for) a German ID card, and since I regularly have to travel to the States this would be *in addition* to the need to have (and *pay* for) a passport.

TL;DR: It would, for me, be more disadvantageous and beneficial.

You don't believe in culture ?

So you really think that all countries should behave the same regarding immigration, that we should all have the same subjective view regarding the numbers of immigrants that come ?

I simply think that we French have a common culture, our state and social organisation relies on very different schemes. For example, we have more [than 36 000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communes_of_France) towns, where other countries have significantly less. Another example is that we socialize differently, becoming friend with a French generally takes longer, but is less superficial than in the anglosaxon world.

These kinds of things are deeply rooted in the way we see the world, and I believe that it has impacts on the way we see new people coming. Of course the world has changed, but still my parents raised me in a certain way and that affects how I react.

Sorry but that's a load of bullshit. Putin's economic rule failed in every aspect. Look at oil prices during Yeltsin's rule and during Putin's and feel the difference. Russia was never about to become a non-country, it's just a load of Putin's propaganda talks.

Point 1 is quite difficult to answer. Just...well, behave as civilized people and you'll be fine with it. Use your common sense. Avoid sitting in common places in tanktop and shorts, try to be courteous and educate. Many public places like restaurants, bars and so on are quite used to kids, so as long as she doesn't run around hitting other customers and doesn't shout too much, you'll be good. Also, note, if you go to a bar and ask for a ""caffè"" or a ""coffee"", they'll give you an espresso, you don't have to ask explicitly for it. If you want american coffee, you should ask for an ""americano"", but mind that not all bars make it. Alternatively, you can opt for the ""lungo"", which is a longer espresso.

2) as i said, avoid the [typical american tourist attire A](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Uh5YeFLwcP4/UKAo_L8-utI/AAAAAAAAa7Q/M_ieeLuUKhU/s320/clothes2.jpg). If you're an adult, walking around in shorts and acapulco shirt may help italians recognize you as a tourist. Try your best to wear ""normal"" clothes.

We have proper cabs (like the London Black Cabs) which can be hailed. We have mini cabs that must be booked and we have limo services which also need to be booked. All of which are licensed. We also have illegal or ""gypsy"" cabs, drivers and cars working outside the system. The regulation goes from high down to zero and the associated risk goes in the other direction. From a price point of view, the illegal cab is often the cheapest but bad things can and do happen and the users are not always equipped to judge the risk. Crimes represent a socialised cost and bad experiences impact the perception of visitors. Anyone taking fare paying passengers has extra hoops to go through.

Illegal cabs do perform a service in cities where the availability of cab licenses is artificially limited such as the NYC with its medallion system however the same issues do not apply in Germany.

true,MrMysterious95,MONA,Village idiot of /r/europe,"I am against the EU. This is another incarnation of Western cultural imperialism. The truth is that Poland today is dominated by sell-outs, who forgot about their ancestors' heritage of resistance and instead decided to work Euro, like slaves in a country that isn't their own.

While economically there's been some development, it's more of a result of abandoning communism than well, giving Poland on a silver platter to Germany and Russia. The new investments seem impressive, but already we're unable to maintain them, and we actually sell out key areas of our economy: gas, power (yes, private power plants!), GMO is stealthily introduced. What's even worse, the government of Tusk signed a new law allowing in essence foreign troops to squash any armed resistance. We're now essentially slaves of the rich West.

Poland and the entire Eastern Europe is being brain-drained. The specialists leave, often to work well below their qualifications, and Poland is left as Europe's India - we don't really produce anything, we are Europe's assembly plant. EU does nothing to stop unemployment. While the rich West has already destroyed their environment, it's quick enough to ""kindly advise"" us not to do the same here. As a result there's literally no hope for Polish industry - which is quite fortuitious for Germans, for instance. Polish railway wagon factories, shipyards, machine industry - all destroyed so that Germans could benefit.

The promise of the peace has always been worthless. Our membership in EU and NATO only makes Poland a target for Russia. Look at what's going on in Ukraine and how EU - which was the one to start the mess - treats that country. For me the West would gladly abandon Poland, but even in case they won't - WWIII will be fought here. Thanks to our pro-western orientation.

And of course there's the matter of culture - Western culture is everywhere, while no good Polish movies, for instance, are being made. How many Polish books are translated into English? How many Polish TV shows are exported? We're takers of what the West decides to flood us with.

That's the real reason why the communism fell - partly because the East couldn't feed itself, partly because strikes destroyed the economy, but mostly because the West really wanted to sell Mickey Mouse behind the Iron Curtain.",0,1410160332,null,0,false,0,ckcapt4,t3_2fq80f,t1_ckcapt4,t3_2fq80f,null,1427129904,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

We played the Cold War game that caused the USSR to fall and with it,German was able to be whole again.At the time , after WW2, we could have left and jus said fuck it and good luck.But we didn't,and stayed to help build up our allies countries.And our enemies.

I stand by my first point.

&gt;You don't have to believe this but it doesn't make it untrue.The US has ideals you may not understand, but you can't accuse us for doing things,solely for our ""interests"".

I understand American ideals, and I am sure that an average American really does believe what his government is doing foreign-policy-wise is the right and just thing to do. But, first, believing it doesn't make it so, and, second, the average politician in Washington, and every other center of power including Moscow, couldn't care less about the plight of an average Pole, Ukrainian, Estonian, or any other person who can not vote for him, especially if they're on the other side of the globe.

As I say, it's all just a risk-to-benefit calculation. Ukraine is of geo-strategic importance to both Russia and U.S. and it's a large market.

Germany probably doesn't want to get too involved because it won't benefit much from it. Why risk relations with Moscow and get involved in a messy conflict in any direct way, especially militarily, to help a country which will then become a part of the EU, i.e. a heavy financial burden on Germany, since Germany is the top contributor to the EU budget?",0,1410162066,null,0,false,0,ckcb20d,t3_2fpyef,t1_ckcb20d,t1_ckc8b9k,null,1427129667,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

1. Like the rest of us, you do not have access to the text and are merely guessing what are inside.

2. The argument ""it is rarely used so it is not a big deal"" is a fallacy. The nuclear bomb has been used twice in history, yet come and say it is not a big deal...

3. Unfortunately ""the reasonable level of scientific evidence"" that something is dangerous is extremely subjective and some countries like to suspend some product when there is a reasonable doubt, not a definite evidence. For instance, a commonly quoted ISDS dispute is over the safety of hydraulic fracturing. Sure, we don't have definite evidence it is bad for health, because the composition of the fracking liquid is a trade secret in most cases!

4. ""Bad faith"" is highly subjective. If someone says ""ok, we will raise the taxes on books in non-local languages"" because he wants to promote local culture, is it bad faith ? 

5. The benefits of free trade is a matter of opinion. I generally agree with this theory, but I find it acceptable that a leader could be elected who thinks free trade is dangerous in some domains and moves to protects some of them. That's normal political debate. If the majority in a country wants to move in one direction or another, let them try. The thing is the kind of mechanism we are discussing serves to put a heavy fine on whoever would like to question the free-trade dominant opinion.

5b. Therefore, even if one (like me) likes free trade but is not sure that it is the ideal 100% of the time in 100% of the cases, I would like to opt out of this treaty or at least make it the matter of a referendum. 

To give you an example. Right now, there is a debate over France selling cutting-edge warships to the Russian navy. The contracts were signed in 2011, the first ship was just finished in 2014. Yet, because of the Ukraine war, France decided to suspend the delivery. That's a matter of sovereignty. I don't like the idea that Putin could sue France over the loss that not having these ships will cause to him. I don't like that in 2011 it would have been possible to set a very high amount of damage in case of unilateral disagreement. 

There are no legitimate international laws and courts yet. In ISDS tribunals, the World Bank chooses one judge, IIRC. How is that a legitimate court to condemn a country?

 Bah, t'embête pas va.. 

&gt; Si un homme fait un crime pédophile avec une carte de EELV dans la poche, pourra tu impliquer la responsabilité du parti ? Bien sur que non. Pourra tu, au pire, impliquer une sorte de responsabilité morale du parti car Cohn Bendit proposait d'abaisser à 12 ans l’âge légal pour le sexe entre adultes et enfants ? Non.

 Rien de politique dans ces comportements / dérapages, même de loin. Ceux qu'on reproche aux membres / électeurs FN ne sont pas du même ordre car rappellent les déviances de la famille politique à laquelle le FN appartient, i.e. l'extrême droite.  C'est vraiment différent. 

&gt;L’extrême droite violente n'existe pas au FN, la plupart sont aux Bloc Identitaire par exemple. Je ne vois pas pourquoi tu veux essayer de faire croire le contraire.

 Parce que je suis persuadé du contraire, tant par des connaissances (ou disons ex-connaissances qui ont mal tourné) que par de nombreux faits :  consignes d'abandonner le style ""skinhead"" aux manifs FN (apparence),  galaxie du GUD qui gravite autour des filles lepen etc... Même si la lepen cherche à montrer une apparence lisse (stratégie de dédiabolisation), le fait-est que la mouvance identitaire n'est pas loin (Louis-Armand de Béjarry, Arnaud Naudin &amp; Christophe Pacotte chez Ménard etc...). 

Par ailleurs, pour qui crois-tu que va le vote de ces identitaires? Pour l'UMP peut-être? Allons, soyons sérieux. 

&gt; Concernant les exemples, tu as eu récemment l'élu UDI qui souhaitais que Hitler est gazé davantage de roms. Ou encore, l'élu PS de Vaulx-en-Velin qui a eu des propos antisémites.

 J'ai tout comme toi entendu parler de ces histoires lamentables dans la presse. Dire que ça n'est pas relevé parce que ne provenant pas du FN (*""[...] et personne ne relève rien""*) est donc faux (stratégie de victimisation?)

&gt; Non, ce qui m'énerve c'est que ton opinion du FN ne vient pas de ce que le FN propose mais viens de l'interprétation de ce que tu en fait en pensant que le FN a systématiquement des intentions cachés.

 Tu as tort de t'énerver. Mon aversion pour le FN provient autant de ses propositions que du fait que je suis intimement persuadé qu'ils ont des intentions cachées. Concernant les propositions, citons la présomption de légitime défense pour les policiers (une aberration absolue), référendum pour le retour de la peine de mort en France, contrôle, flicage des immigrés, des syndicats, des juges, des enseignants, des chercheurs, révision de l'IVG, subvention ""la femme aux fourneaux"". Evidemment je pense aussi au haros complet sur les immigrés (préférence nationale ou tout autre dénomination dé-diabolisatrice qu'ils aient pu inventer) visible dans de nombreux points de leur programme.. Le volet économique est moins de mon ressort, mais j'ai pu lire suffisamment de critiques d'économistes qui me semblent compétents pour douter de sa pertinence. En tout état de cause, d'un point de vue personnel, je ne veux pas revenir au franc ni opérer quelque ""retour en arrière"" que ce soit. Un volet de leur programme qui me touche plus concerne la recherche et l'enseignement supérieur, ou à part leur critique de la loi LRU (où ils ont beau jeu d'ailleurs), c'est totalement à l'ouest (genre publication en Français...lol).. 

Plus généralement, je reproche au FN de construire un pseudo-programme ajusté pour qu'il réponde aux plus bas instincts de son électorat tout en se donnant une apparence de respectabilité. Je n'y crois pas une seule seconde, et le moment venu, s'ils arrivent au pouvoir, ils devront bien agir selon les desiderata de leur électorat, et là ça risque de ne pas être bien joli... 

&gt; Peut être que MLP est parfaitement sincère, peut être qu'elle souhaite et veut réussir l'assimilation des populations immigrées, peu être qu'elle n'a pas d'intentions fasciste dans la tête, peut être qu'elle n'est pas du tout raciste. Qu'en sait tu ? 

 Je ne pense pas qu'elle soit raciste au sens ""suprématisme blanc"" des tarés de stormfront, évidement, mais je serai moins catégorique concernant le caractère fascisant. C'est ma conviction personnelle, et je suis loin d'être le seul dans ce cas. En plus, dans le doute, le mieux reste de ne pas ""essayer"". Ça n'est pas parce que le neurochirurgien n'a pas pu régler un problème qu'il faut demander au plombier de tenter sa chance... euh.. tu vois ce que je veux dire je pense :P

&gt; Ce que je te reproche c'est le procès d'intention.

 Comme j'ai essayé de te le montrer ci-dessus, c'est peut-être un procès d'intention, mais j'ai tout de même quelques arguments pour étayer mon sentiment.

The Trial Chamber held that neither the NATO bombing, nor the ongoing armed conflict between the Kosovo Liberation Army, or “KLA”, and the forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, or “FRY”, and Serbia were the primary cause of the flight of the hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanians. Rather, the Trial Chamber held that it was the **deliberate actions** of the forces of the FRY and Serbia during the campaign of violence that **caused the departure of at least 700,000 Kosovo Albanians** from Kosovo. The Trial Chamber further found that “during the time of the crimes alleged in the Indictment” a **joint criminal enterprise**, or “JCE” existed, the common purpose of which was **to forcibly displace the Kosovo Albanian population** both within and without Kosovo through a widespread and **systematic campaign of terror and violence**. The Trial Chamber found that this was **to ensure continued control** by the authorities of FRY and Serbia over Kosovo. The Trial Chamber also concluded that while the crimes of  deportation and forcible transfer were within the ambit of the common purpose, the crimes of murder, as a violation of the laws or customs of war, and murder and persecution, through murder, sexual assault, and destruction of or damage to religious property, as **crimes against humanity**, fell outside the common purpose of the JCE.

Milan Milutinović, former President of the Republic of Serbia and Yugoslav Foreign Minister, acquitted.

Schau mal genau auf die Schreiben die du bekommen hast. Die meisten werden schlicht Zahlungsaufforderungen sein, bzw. Information über deine Zwangsanmeldung. Eines dieser Schreiben trägt die Überschrift Gebührenbescheid und hat auf der Rückseite eine Rechtsbehelfsbelehrung. Dieses Schreiben ist ein Verwaltungsakt und auf diesen muss innerhalb der Frist reagiert werden, ansonsten wird der Verwaltungsakt rechtswirksam, auch wenn die Grundlage dessen verfassungswidrig ist. 

Sprich solltest du dem nicht widersprochen haben, bist du von nun an Schuldner und die GEZ Gläubiger, ein ganz normales Schuldverhältnis, ein Titel, allerdings nur über die bereits angefallenen Beiträge, NICHT(!) über die zukünftigen. 

Die werden dir also weiterhin schreiben und dich wieder x-mal auffordern zu zahlen bis sie dir einen weiteren Gebührenbescheid schicken, dann über die neu angefallenen Gebühren und das Spiel geht von vorne los.

Die Folgen sind erstmal nicht gravierend. Man nervt dich mit Post und irgendwann akkumuliert sich das. Ich weiß nicht ab welcher Summe die GEZ sagt nun schalten wir einen Gerichtsvollzieher ein, das Recht dazu haben sie grundsätzlich immer sobald sie einen Titel erlangt haben. Bei der Anzahl an Schuldnern ist es aber schlicht unmöglich jedem einen Gerichtsvollzieher zu schicken.

Die GEZ arbeitet aber vor allem im Hintergrund über die Bürokratie. Sprich Schufa. Bekannt sind auch Fälle von Schuldnern welche in die Privatinsolvenz gehen wollten. Dazu brauchst du die Zustimmung all deiner Gläubiger, die i. d. R. auch erteilt wird. Die GEZ hat diese Zustimmung noch nie erteilt, sprich sie entlässt dich nicht aus den Schulden und zerstört somit jegliche Hoffnung auf Neuanfang.

Falls der Gerichtsvollzieher kommt läuft das so ab:

1. Schriftliche Ankündigung mit Datum, bei Nichtanwesenheit deiner Person kommt er wieder

2. Nun hat er einen""Durchsuchungbeschluss"" und 2 Polizisten dabei, was ihm Zugang zu deiner Wohnung garantiert.

3. Pfändung von Gegenständen, versteigern dieser.

Dies ist aber nur der äußerste Ausnahmefall und das Maximale was ein Gerichtsvollzieher machen kann. Viel wahrscheinlicher wird es sein, dass er mit dir spricht, Ratenzahlung vereinbart etc. Dies ist aber auch keine Garantie, dass die GEZ sich darauf einlässt. Unter Umständen besteht diese auf Pfändung. Fälle dazu sind mir nicht bekannt.

Deshalb, immer den Beitragsbescheid abwarten, sofort Widerspruch einlegen, Ablehnung des Widerspruches abwarten, klagen!

Ach ja, einfach Geld vom Konto holen ist nicht. Entweder du zahlst freiwillig oder die pfänden. Hast du kein Geld auf dem Konto oder behauptest das, zwingt man dich zum Offenbarungseid.

Which means sow as much chaos and division among western allies and release classified data regarding intelligence operations against the Chinese to paralyze the US from doing anything to check Russia's agenda. You can't honestly believe that he gives a fuck about ""embarrassing his American partners"". His sole foreign policy agenda is to split the US and EU into opposing camps, to get the US to leave NATO so that he can have a freer hand in European policy. As much as Europeans dislike American influence it has been a great source of stability in Western Europe (just think France and England are no longer trying to rip the throat out of Germany and vice versa.) It hopefully wouldn't get that bad, but without it, national divisions would become much clearer. Without the current alliance would Europe have been able to come to a consensus on Russia? Probably not. There would probably have been a fundamental split between Eastern and Western Europe, there would have been a much deeper sense of betrayal in Poland and the Baltic's, they would not have been nearly as understanding of Western Europe's reluctance.

&gt;__Meerschaum__ (^i/ˈmɪərʃɔːm/ *__MEER__-shawm* or /ˈmɪərʃəm/ *__MEER__-shəm*, German for *foam of the sea*), also known as __[sepiolite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepiolite)__, is a soft white [mineral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral), often used to make [smoking pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_pipe_(tobacco\)). It is sometimes found floating on the [Black Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea) and rather suggestive of sea-foam, hence the German origin of the name as well as the French name for the same substance, *écume de mer*.

J'ai un conseil un peu différent à donner!
L'oktoberfest, c'est le plus connut et touristique, mais (de mon point de vue ^^) la bière n'y est pas excellente et cela grouille vraiment de monde.

Je te conseil donc de jeter également un coup d’œil du côté des autres festivals, comme le stark bier par exemple, la bière y est meilleure, il y a toujours beaucoup d'ambiance et des gens qui viennent de partout mais c'est un peu plus ""propre"" disons, et un poil moins cher!

Il y en a un également où ce sont les étudiants de la régions qui demandent des ""dons"" aux grandes brasseries allemandes et ensuite revendent tout dans une grosse fête, il y a du choix, plus de jeunes, et c'est sympa apparemment. Je n'y suis pas allé moi même, je ne connais no le nom ni la date :)

De plus, comme ils sont moins connus, c'est moins la galère pour les hôtels/auberge de jeunesses, et encore une fois, moins cher :)

Dans tout les cas, prend un petit dej dans une brasserie: pinte de bière blanche ambrée, saucisse blanche à peler typique du matin/déjeuner, à tremper dans une moutarde sucrée, avec un bretzel. Vraiment sympa!

Voilà bon séjour!

&gt; A lot of people worry about the ISDS and how much power it has. The thing is, they greatly over-inflate what it can do and where it's applicable.

Without knowing the ISDS mechanisms that will be put in place.

2/ ""Reasonnable"", ""generally"" I love how precise these things are... So in the absence of a consensus one way or the other, something should be deemed safe? Or unsafe? That's a pretty important issue.

3/ So, we have to trust the US-approved companies on that? Mind if we do our own tests to be sure? What if we find different results? The tribunal gets to decide?

4/ Biased judges and arbitrary judgments did actually (partially) cause the collapse of my society and the two-speed feudal justice was a reason for the French revolution. Right now we manage to judge bad faith because we have whole institutions dedicated to offer counter-weights to judges power and to try and force them to be as unbiased as possible, and even so, a lot of case still escalate up to the EU court of human rights.

Indeed, if the integrity and neutrality of the judges in ISDS was firmly established and recognized, I would have far less problems with that. But having the WB name a judge reminds too much of the judge named by the king.

Et la seule envie que j'ai c'est de me barrer, dans tous les sens du terme. Sortir de cet open space qui est l'endroit le plus deshumanisé que je fréquente. Je commence à me poser des questions existentielles constamment. Pourquoi les murs sont blancs ? Pourquoi des néons allumés constamment alors qu'il fait bien jour ? Pourquoi ces mêmes néons produisent-ils une lumière aussi moche ? Et en regardant dehors, je vois quoi ? D'autres immeubles moches, et blancs. (c'est à Courbevoie) Pourquoi blanc ?!

Il y a tellement de couleurs plus jolies, plus chaudes que ce blanc dégeulasse qui fait plus penser à un hôpital qu'autre chose. 

Et mes collègues. Comment-ils font pour rester ici ? Mon maître d'apprentissage approche sa retraite et a passé toute sa vie dans ce genre d'environnement. Comment a-t-il fait ?!

Bref ton mec il fume un peu sur les tarifs. 

Pourquoi 10 fois plus ? 

- Prend un ingénieur payé 3000 Euros brut par mois, 

- Rajoute la part patronale des cotisations sociales et autres frais similaire, à la louche tu doubles le brut (bon c'est plutôt +50% du brut mais on pinaille) 

- Un consultant est facturé 10 mois par ans mais est payé sur 12 (congés payés + quelques RTT) 

- Il faut payer le consultant lorsqu'il est en intercontrat et autres trucs du genre 

- Et puis les rapaces des SSII prennent une marge non négligeable (L'intéret d'être consultant indépendant c'est justement de se mettre cette part dans la poche à condition de se taper tout le boulot de prospection, facturation etc...) 

1400 Euros par mois sur 10 mois (car tu prendras des vacances) ca fait 14 000 par ans (et encore j'ai pas parlé des frais professionnels). À ce pris là, lances toi dans une thèse ce sera plus enrichissant

Do you think the public is educated enough to elect people who show an understanding of such a bill? If the people is too dumb to make a stance on an issue, then it is too dumb to elect representative to take the good decisions, and you probably think that democracy is a bad idea.

Obviously voters are not all specialists of international trade litigation but what if it is acceptable for us to elect electing experts that decide on a text, surely it should be acceptable for us to vote directly on the text while listening to the advice of experts we trust?

Teoricamente, tutti quelli che producono pipe applicano una ""gradazione"" in base a: qualità della radica, errori, stuccature.

Le mie pipe hanno qualche errorino, ma devi proprio andarlo a cercare.

Il prezzo dipende dalla radica che, evidentemente, è di qualità ""comune"".

Questo non vuol dire che una pipa da 30€ debba far schifo: un amico ha una Brebbia Junior che va benissimo, la Savinelli Grezza è stata la mia prima e ha fatto il suo lavoro.

Più sali di prezzo, più una pipa è leggera, fondamentalmente, poi entra in gioco il discorso ""collezionismo"".

All of us vaguely remember how it happened, but to refresh your memory:

1) Maidan happens, Crimea officials and some civilians call Putin for help.

2) Green men start to appear, slowly incapacitating Ukraine's defence forces in Crimea.

3) Putin announces a referendum, Crimea joins Russia.

Now, this is really interesting. Ever since Russia got hold of Crimea proper, there were almost two weeks or so of utter silence over what to do before he announces the referendum. At the time, it was painfully obvious that he sent shock troops to help save the Crimeans from what he thought was a fascist junta. As he soon discovered, there was no junta on the borders, and the Crimeans were safe. However, by that time he already sent troops to Ukraine, the world saw it, his domestic ratings skyrocketed, and the Crimeans felt threatened still. So at this point, he was facing a choice between staying in Crimea and making enemies abroad, or withdrawing and thus 'betraying' the crimeans in the eyes of most Russian citizens. In the end, he chose not to lose face and annexed Crimea. 

To make matters worse for him, Donbas also requested help, which again forced him to choose between helping the rebels or 'betraying' them. This time he really was wavering, as can be seen by his repeated declarations that the rebels should put down their weapons. In the end however, they did not, and he had to intervene or risk bankrupting his popularity with the Russian speaking world.

Yes, federalism has value. Getting rid of redundant layers of administration has value, too. It's not like the Federal States of the EU are going to happen tomorrow. It's not clear that it's going to happen in that form at all, for that matter.  
Although, as someone who rejects nationalism, I'm all for removing unnecessary and in a global society increasingly arbitrary walls of separation between people(s). And it's not like counties (Kreise, Bezirke) or things like that would disappear. Some degree of administrative sub levels have to exist in order to have the process remain functional.  

There's a lot of ground any conclusive discussion on the issue would have to cover. On the face of it though, from the non-technical POV, I'm against identities being anchored to tribalism. Imo, subjects like nations, including Bundesländer, are nothing more than administrative regions, existing in their form primarily out of historical reasons still. Attaching one's identity to that is bizarre to me. I don't see myself as primarily German either, and choose to converse in English in an environment in which Germans as well as internationals are present, even when I'm talking to a German person, much as we are doing now.",0,1410170222,null,0,1410171177,0,ckccerm,t3_2fq2yq,t1_ckccerm,t1_ckcauru,null,1427128820,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

There's really no other way to do it, but it does seem like bullshit to me. It means the voters won't really have to deal with the consequences since regardless of what happens to Scotland they can still move south if it all goes tits up. It's people born from then on that would suffer.

It is called democracy and sovereignty, man. Look it up. Australia can decide to go full coal, Germany to phase out nuclear and US to promote obesity. ""Just because"".

Oh and they don't worry, they rationalize all these things because of a need: Australia needs more exports and mining, Germany needs green energy and US needs jobs in the agricultural sector.

&gt; They've banned minarets.

Yep. They've banned minaret. They haven't invaded a country 'by mistake' or have made military deals with all the obvious dictators of northern-Africa and Russia. No, their biggest failing that everyone keep repeating is that they banned minaret. A thing that no one, not even muslims care about. Meanwhile, in France, it is mosques that are almost impossible to build.

Yeah, to live in the country with the 3rd HDI in the world you have to accept that there won't be minarets on mosques.

&gt; They've screwed themselves on billions in research grants plus lost things like ERASMUS.

And yet, strangely, they have some of the best research labs of Europe.

Yes, Switzerland tends to be a bit more xenophobic and misogynistic than its neighbors (though they could make a contest with Austria I guess) but this is a feature of the population, not of the system. And given your assumption that a country can't be managed or economically survive if the population gets a say in every important treaty or law made, I would say that Switzerland proves this to be totally wrong.

&gt; The public is largely apathetic because they're apathetic, not because they're not asked.

The public here knows about all the life and gossips of all the possible presidential candidates. Because that's basically the only choice we got. When there was the referendum over the EU constitution however, **a lot** of people suddenly knew more about the institutions. I remember speaking with a taxi driver in Berlin about the declaration of human rights they put in it. People knew about a lot of the important things: consensus required, death penalty abolished everywhere, how EU laws get decided, what their extent were.

And go in Switzerland, everyone knows a lot about minarets now! ",0,1410170985,null,0,1410179750,0,ckccj99,t3_2frgb2,t1_ckccj99,t1_ckcccm5,null,1427128761,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I'm all for working together. But I just think it's too big to have a efficient government. There are no European (Labour) Unions: each country has national unions. There is no European media to check the government: each country has its own national media to check the national government.

A democracy *needs* a media that checks the government. A democracy *needs* people to care about politics. No one in the EU (except for the people here maybe) actually care for the EU. They only care for the part that affects them.

In the last election for the parliament (that cannot make laws and where you can only vote for people from your own country) only **36%** came to vote in my country. 36%!!!

We need to have an EU based on cooperation. Not on passing on soevereignity to the EU. It has no democratic basis, not being checked by media and it is too far away from the people. 

The financial sector is a fine example of this. Since the banks started to fail in 2007 pretty much all politicians have started to panick. No one knew what the fuck to do about the banks. So they bailed them out. Gave them money without making the banks of the shareholders pay. Because the bankers said that was what needed to be done. 

And now, 5 years later: all of the politicians still have *no fucking clue* about what to do with the banks. So they simply hand over the authority to the ECB / EU and create a banking union. But here is the kicker: **the EU is run by the same politicians that ran national governments 5 years ago**. And they still have no clue about what to do with the banks. National governments couldn't keep their banks in line so now they expect the EU to do it for *all banks in the EU*. It makes no sense.

**And this is what happens every time:** when politicians don't have the answer to problems they simply point to the EU. 

And this goes both ways: politicians who don't want to propose (necessary) reforms point to the ECB to print money. And politicians who don't know how to solve problems kick the problems (deficit, banking union, euro) up to the EU level. And this kind of playing with soevereignity does not create good policy or good vision.

true,Kookanoodles,PDL,Pays de la Loire,"I don't think they are, really! I live in Paris and, being from the French countryside, I grew up having quite a poor opinion of Parisians, but I really think it's just a misunderstanding. People seem to accept that New Yorkers, who live in one of the biggest and busiest cities on Earth, can sometimes be snappy and rude, but somehow Parisians aren't allowed to be, despite living in a big capital too? Many tourists tend to forget that just because it's quaint and pretty, Paris isn't a theme park (I'm sure you're not like that though).  

Contrary to what many people think, politeness is actually very important in France, and in Paris too. The problem is that most of the rules are unwritten. Many tourists, especially Americans, tend to expect cultural differences and odd social norms when going to exotic places likes Japan or China, but assume that everything in France works just like at home. It doesn't: some things that Americans think is polite, French people will think is rude. It's important to know what to expect and what to do, because while French people would usually give you a pass if you don't abide by every little unwritten rule, Parisians who have to deal with tourists all year long might not be as understanding. Here are a few things to keep in mind:  

* You shouldn't walk up to people in the street and start asking for directions right away. You have to say hello, apologize for disturbing, wait for them to say hello back, and then you can ask what you wanted to ask. It sounds complicated, but it's a second nature to most people here and forgetting it might result in people answering very snappily or even walking away. Seriously: I like to think I'm a relatively nice person and I love to help out tourists, but when they walk up to you in the street and just go ""hello I want to know how to go wherever"" without letting you say a word, it's extremely annoying and doesn't make me want to help them very much.  

* Little shops like bakeries and such aren't public spaces: you have to say hello when entering, even if the shopkeeper can't hear you, and idealy say goodbye when leaving. The divide between public and private spaces isn't the same in France than in America, at all, and those little shops are considered extensions of the owner's home (they often actually are), so you have to behave like you would in a home, and say hello. It's a little thing, but it'll be appreciated and the shopkeeper will be that much friendlier towards you! You don't have to do it in big supermarkets and the like, though. 

* Waiters. What to do, what to do. You've probably heard everything about Parisians waiters, and it's true that some of them are downright unpleasant. As a rule of thumb, avoid touristy spots when eating or drinking, they're too expensive anyway. A good example of something that Americans find polite that is considered rude in France is the check: French waiters won't bring you the check until you ask. An American might think it's rude and that they're being ignored, but it's actually bringing the check unsolicited that would be considered rude in France: it pretty much means the restaurant is asking you to get out.  

* Last thing: smiling. By American politeness conventions, it's pretty much a requirement. It simply isn't in France, so don't think people dislike you or anything if they don't smile when talking to you, we only smile when we mean it. You can take advantage of your vacation in France to relax you facial muscles!

Je ne veux pas essayer d'empêcher les Français d’émigrer mais qu'ils prennent les bonnes destinations comme l'Europe par exemple. On a que ça des pays intéressant où la vie économique et sociale sont une vertu (l'Allemagne, la Pologne à qui je ne lui donne même pas 20-30 ans pour être encore plus prospère parce que c'est un pays dont le devenir est en marche, l'Autriche, Pays-Bas, etc).

La principale raison que j'entends des émigrés c'est le boulot. J'ai envie de dire aux Français qu'il faut être créatif pardi, qu'il faut le créer le boulot s'il n'y en a pas. J'ai aussi envie de dire au gouvernement de se bouger le cul pour arrêter de faire chier les entrepreneurs parce que s'ils n'embauchent pas c'est à cause de cette administration foireuse. L'autre mec sur /r/france qui allait se faire entuber par son employeur est une bon exemple.

* /r/thefappening (le subreddit avec les photos leaks de célébrités) a été banni.

* Un certain nombre d'utilisateurs de reddit sont fâchés contre les admins pour deux raisons : Soit parce que les admins ont bannis /r/thefappening (HURR DURR FREE SPEACH). Soit à l'inverse parce que ça n'a pas été fait plutôt ou parce que d'autres subreddits tout aussi glauques continuent d'exister sans que les admins fassent quoi que soit contre.

* /u/yishan par ailleurs a fait [un post sur le blog de reddit assez foireux pour expliquer l'affaire](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2foivo/every_man_is_responsible_for_his_own_soul/) qui a seulement réussi a énerver les deux camps du débats.

* Entre temps /u/jedberg (ancien admin) poste sur /r/paris parce qu'il compte y aller en vacances.

* son poste est retiré par /u/automoderator parce qu'il n'est pas conforme aux règles de /r/paris (les demandes d'aides pour un voyage doivent se faire sur un post dédié)

* /u/yishan (admin de reddit), en réponse au fait que le post de /u/jedberg ait été retiré fait une blague, en référence à l'affaire en cours et à la prétendue censure de l'administration de reddit : """"reddit is censoring me! I liked things better when /u/jedberg was running the place!""

* les redditeurs déjà en colère contre les admins trouvent que sa blague est un manque de respect envers la communauté et s'énervent.

true,spid88,emilia-romagna,,"Pretty much what others here have already said.  
1- Forget everything American culture taught you about Italy.  
2- English is fine, certainly nobody expects you to learn italian for such a short visit. Just be aware that you'll inevitably (and quite often, I fear) find someone who doesn't understand you and/or is incapable of answering you in a meaningful way, especially outside of the more touristy areas.  
3-  Italian American != Italian.   
4-  If you want to avoid being immediately spotted as a tourist avoiding the tourist attire someone linked here is a good start.  A good rule of thumb for the food is: Any Italian dish you can eat in the USA doesn't exist in Italy, so don't ask for mac&amp;cheese, Alfredo or spaghetti Bolognese.  Two exceptions are Lasagne (Lasagna is a single sheet of pasta, Lasagne is plural)  and, of course, Pizza, both of which are very different from what you're used to and **VERY** dependend on geographical location, which brings us to point 5.  
5- Every region is different.  Hell, every province is different and sometimes there are significative differences between neighboring comuni (kinda like counties, but smaller).  Trying to learn at least a little about the specific places you're visiting will go a long way.  e.g. If you ask for risotto alla milanese in Calabria, you're going to have a bad time.  
If you tell us which cities you're visiting Im sure someone will give you more specific advice.    
6- If you're in a touristy city and you see a lot of nice open restaurants along the main avenues AVOID THEM like the plague.  I mean it, *steer clear*.  Those are tourist traps with ridiculous prices and bad food.

Marseille is not that bad for tourists, as long as they don't try to visit the obvious bad places.

To go out in the evening, I'd recommend either le vieux port or Cours Julien. There are some cool irish pubs at the vieux port, but it's pretty expensive I'd say (something around 6€ the pint). They have some cool beers like Chouffe and Guiness but still... you wouldn't do that everyday. The strong alcohols are pretty basic but less expensive.
You also have night clubs there.

At cours Julien the pubs are more ""standard"" but you have some nice cocktail bars. Again, for about 10€ the glass of rum, you won't get heavily drunk there. But you can go to a small pub, get a beer, and if you are lucky it will be a concert night (mostly the friday/saturday).

In consequence, Russia agreed that it would acquire the USSR's seat as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.[2] This was also accepted by the rest of the former states of the USSR; in a letter dated 24 December 1991, Boris Yeltsin, at the time President of the Russian Federation, informed the Secretary-General that the membership of the Soviet Union in the Security Council and all other United Nations organs was being continued by the Russian Federation with the support of the 11 member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.[3] All Soviet embassies became Russian embassies.

On a osé être en désaccord avec les USA, alors qu'ils nous avaient ""sauvés pendant la 2nd guerre mondiale"".. Freedom fries et j'en passe. La haine viscérale de certains américains pour la France était massive. Pour ceux qui s'en souviennent, c'était assez dingue. 

À ce point là? J'étais trop jeune en 2003 pour y connaître quelque chose mais il y a vraiment eu autant de haine à cause de ça? Woah...

&gt;Premièrement, la France depuis De Gaulle possède une position relativement atypique dans le monde occidental ; les gouvernements successifs ont souvent tenu à défendre une politique extérieure indépendante. Bien que nous étions alignés avec les USA en tant qu'alliés, nous jouions, plus que d'autres occidentaux, nos propres intérêts, parfois en conflit avec les souhaits des américains. Dès lors, certains gouvernements américains étaient mécontents de la France, et cette attitude envers nous s'est répandue chez certains de la population. Certains américains considéraient alors qu'on ne les aimaient pas, parce qu'on ne leur léchaient pas le cul à longueur de temps, et donc ironiquement ils nous aiment pas parce qu'ils pensent qu'on ne les aime pas (ce qui selon moi est faux). 

C'est plus trop comme ça depuis Hollande (voire même depuis Sarkozy). Déjà à cause de l'Union Européenne. Il y a énormément d'Américanisme dans ce gouvernement et pour le voir il suffit de constater sa position par rapport à l'Ukraine et la Russie (qui n'est pas aussi diabolique qu'on le croit). Le traité de libre échange entre les USA et l'Europe aussi. Quelle connerie ce truc! Ça ne concerne même pas le Canada ni le Mexique et on n'a clairement rien à y gagner. Et puis plus récemment il y a la dévaluation de l'Euro qui tombe presque nez-à-nez avec le dollar US. C'est une honte. 

Concernant la France, on suit beaucoup l'Américanisation et l'atlantisme me fait relativement peur. Il ne se passe pas un Journal Télé de France 2 à 20h sans une page sur les USA (la bouffe française aux USA, les USA en Iraq, les Français aux USA, la merde USA, comment les USA font leurs courses, etc). Niveau économie c'est pareil. Rachat d'entreprises françaises par des américains (il y avait une usine de pneus, une autre d'aluminium je crois non?). Sarko avait tout le temps son nez fourré chez Obama. Hollande un peu moins parce qu'il a un anglais pourri peut-être?

J'ai l'impression qu'on voit plus les Américains en bien qu'eux nous voient en mal et ça me trou le cul.

Il n'y a qu'à regarder le conseil de l'OTAN qui se déroule maintenant: pas une seule image sans la tronche d'Obama. C'est lui qui est placé au milieu de la table en plus. Pas Hollande, ni Cameron, ni qui que ce soit d'autre. Non il faut que ce soit Obama au milieu de l'image...

On s'en tape de la première, et même de la deuxième tentative en Irak... Parmi les point que vous évoquez, aucun ne répond à la question posée. 

Ça a pris Hitler 12 jours pour prendre Paris, le temps que ça prend un tank de venir d'Allemagne à l'époque. Aucune résistance, pathétique. Les nazis n'ont même pas perdu leur temps d'envahir le sud... Ils étaient déjà partants et motivés dans leur collaboration. Il y avait un camp de concentration à Aix... Fucking insane les gars. Seul les italiens, et bien sûr les autrichiens on collaboré autant. 

Je sais que dans le nord ils sont plus chaleureux, convivial et ont lutté beaucoup plus contre les nazis qu'ici au soleil. 

Je sais que ils sont ""spéciales"" ces marseillais. 

Je sais que vous avez eu raison de contester l'invasion en Irak (c'est une honte lamentable que les britanniques ont suivi Bush.) 
Je sais que certains politiciens Ricain ont tordu la vérité pour générer un sentiment anti France. 

Mais ça ne change rien. Les gens se moquent de vous car, d'après le comportement (se rendre, collaboration, dénonciation meurtrier de vos propres voisins) dans la deuxième guerre mondiale, vous méritez d'être traité de lâche. 

Donc, les blagues viennent de là mes potos ! Inutile de réagir, inutile de laisser votre orgueil vous exciter, inutile de penser que le sentiment de quelques millions d'américains vous perturber (car ils ont taure de vous haïr à cause d'Irak.) 

Un mot de plus... En générale, surtout ici dans le sud, mais aussi à Paris (mais bien sûr pas du tout partout dans la France) il faut pas se confondre la politesse avec un comportement très formel. En vrais, les gens du nord, et USA inclus, sont beaucoup plus polis, plus chaleureux, vous vous cachez derrière ces codes formels et le vouvoiement pour garder votre distance, pour mieux juger les autres et généralement râler sur tout et n'importe quoi. 

So... I love you, I live your country... I'm never going to leave! Mais, on a demandé pourquoi on se moque, et c'est la faute des hommes politiques il y a deux générations.

Just to clarify, the vast majority of public opinion in the whole of Britain is that it should be for Scotland to choose how it wants to be governed. I think everyone thinks that there should be a democratic, legal process for Scotland's future.

That doesn't mean that there aren't also people who think that the UK, as it currently exists, isn't something worth saving. There are people in Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales who think that the UK is worth saving and therefore hope that Scotland vote to stay in the UK. However, obviously if Scotland vote to leave the UK, that vote should be respected.

Je suis pas sur que ça ne soit vrai, il y a un théorème en science politique qui dit exactement le contraire:

Ce résultat, appelé ""le théorème de la prévalence de la diversité sur la compétence"", énonce que, sous certaines conditions, une assemblée constituée des membres tirés au sort est plus performante pour résoudre un problème qu'une assemblée constituée des membres les plus compétents.

&gt; Déjà à cause de l'Union Européenne

WTF? l'UE est le premier rempart contre l'influence US. C'est le seul moyen de pouvoir négocier des traités de libre-échange avec eux sans être en position de faiblesse (au moins sur le plan économique). Nous pouvons imposer beaucoup plus que si nous étions à négocier dans notre coin. Les US tentent de destabiliser la construction de l'Europe pour cette raison, ce qui est largement visible au niveau diplomatique.

&gt; Ça ne concerne même pas le Canada

On a négocié un traité de libre-échange avec le Canada il y a peu de temps justement. Quel rapport au fait ?

&gt; Il ne se passe pas un Journal Télé de France 2 à 20h sans une page sur les USA

Vraiment ? Je ne regarde pas les JT, mais quand je tombe dessus ce n'est pas mon impression. L'influence est beaucoup plus importante du point de vue série, cinéma et musique pop. Mais ce n'est pas la culture ""américaine"", c'est la culture commerciale spécialement faite pour être populaire partout.

&gt; Hollande un peu moins parce qu'il a un anglais pourri peut-être?

Difficile de faire pire que Sarkozy. C'est juste que Sarkozy était un atlantiste convaincu. La gauche en France est en général beaucoup plus à gauche que les démocrate américain (et de façon différente de toute façon). C'est assez logique qu'ils soient plus éloignés.

&gt; Il n'y a qu'à regarder le conseil de l'OTAN qui se déroule maintenant: pas une seule image sans la tronche d'Obama. C'est lui qui est placé au milieu de la table en plus. Pas Hollande, ni Cameron, ni qui que ce soit d'autre. Non il faut que ce soit Obama au milieu de l'image...

Sans blague ? L'armée de l'OTAN, c'est principalement les USA. Le premier budget militaire après les USA c'est la Chine, et ensuite la France. Dans les traités que nous avons avec l'OTAN, nous dépensons beaucoup moins. Politiquement l'OTAN est dirigé par les USA, et c'est leur armée qui a les capacités de projections nécessaires pour faire respecter les accords allant avec l'adhésion.

L'Europe a un budget total n'arrivant même pas à la moitié de celui des USA. Il nous faudra une politique militaire commune beaucoup plus avancée pour pouvoir prétendre à avoir une place plus avancée dans l'OTAN.

Les USA sont une superpuissance. LA superpuissance, militaire et économique. Bien sûr qu'il faut passer par eux pour faire du commerce de temps en temps. Si on veut jouer dans la même court, on doit s'allier avec nos plus proches alliés, les autres pays européens. L'Europe a déjà permis de résister à son influence. L'Union Européenne est second en dépense militaire et premier en PIB. Avec une dépense militaire plus efficace, on pourra être une compétition digne de ce nom.

No. The media is reporting and calling on the leaders of Better Together to act to save the Union. Some examples:

* ""Monarch in talks with PM""

* ""Osborne warns Scots…""

* ""Queen in talks with Cameron"" and ""Rush to produce timetable…"" (its Westminster producing this timetable)

* ""… George Osborne promises more devolution powers…""

* ""Westminster parties unite over Scotland""

* ""Leaders pledge to fast track further devolution""

This has relevance to the entire UK (though its absolutely Scotland's decision alone), hence why its in the newspapers across the UK. However, as you'll see, the actual call to action is specifically for those who can and are supposed to be acting, i.e. Cameron, Clegg, Miliband, Better Together.

&gt;All vocals must be sung live: no voices are permitted on backing tracks.  In 1999, the Croatian song featured sounds on their backing track which sounded suspiciously like human voices. The Croatian delegation stated that there were no human voices, but only digitally synthesised sounds which replicated vocals. The EBU nevertheless decided that they had broken the spirit of the rules, and docked them 33% of their points total that year for the purpose of calculating their five-year points average for future qualification.

true,msx,veneto,,"* mangiare nel senso di pranzare no, abbiamo una saletta caffe' con tavolini per pranzare in sede. Bere o mangiare uno snack (crackers, etc), e' permesso
* ultimamente si, abbiamo musica, quando ero in un'altro ufficio nella stessa azienda pero' non lo facevamo (alla capa dava fastidio). E' permesso anche mettersi le cuffie e ascoltare cio' che si vuole
* Ufficialmente abbiamo 2 pause a meta' mattina e meta' pomeriggio. In realta' poi tanti aggiungono altre pause, anche scendendo a fumare, altri magari fanno mezz'ora in saletta caffe'. C'e' moltissima liberta per le pause, devi veramente esagerare per farti richiamare. C'era una tipa che faceva part time e di quelle poche ore il 50% era in saletta. Ora l'hanno richiamata e le ore in saletta sono passate al 20% circa.
* Si, e' consentito navigare un po' per i fatti propri. Ovviamente se il capo ogni volta che viene da te ti vede in cazzeggio, dopo un po' ti richiama. Io personalmente sono cintura nera di alt-tab e cazzeggio veramente troppo, se controllassero la quantita' di traffico internet per persona probabilmente mi licenzierebbero.

In generale quindi da noi c'e' una liberta' veramente ampia, aggiungici anche l'orario flessibile, la mancanza di straordinari, etc etc, e capirai bene che sono in un posto davvero invidiabile.

true,cyborg_selkie,EART,"US citizen, lives in Romania, married into Englishness","I was always under the impression that the Queen - really, the Royal Family in general - doesn't give her/their opinion on political matters, ever. Being overly political is probably a bad policy if you don't want to be dethroned. I'm pretty sure if Prince Charles spoke his mind about politics the number of republicans would double - assuming anyone would take what he said seriously, anyway. 

I do know that the Queen has the right to interfere politically (beyond chats with the serving PM) but never, ever does. It just wouldn't serve the monarchy well if she did. ",0,1410178869,null,0,false,0,ckce4i9,t3_2fsq5q,t1_ckce4i9,t1_ckcdlvi,null,1427127864,31,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,31

- In cuffia ascolto quello che mi pare, essendo in un open space se qualcuno vuole sentire qualcosa in diffusione chiede il permesso agli altri. Di solito io e un altro paio di persone siamo quelli incaricati di mettere le playlist quando c'è voglia di musica.

- Sì, nei limiti della ragionevolezza. Non timbrando e non avendo orari rigidi, ognuno si autogestisce.

- Ovvio, altrimenti andrei via, per me togliere internet o limitarlo è come togliere le finestre o le sedie.

Ho la fortuna di lavorare in un settore creativo, e dove ho lavorato si ragiona per date di consegna dei progetti, piuttosto che per ""otto ore incatenato alla sedia"". Ho avuto esperienze un po' più rigide in passato e sono sempre state disastrose, oltre che peggiori sotto il lato produttivo. Coordinando dei team, ho trovato che dando date di scadenza, ma piena libertà di gestione dei tempi, si riesce a ottenere molti più risultati, piuttosto che stando col fiato sul collo e pretendendo le otto ore canoniche senza mai alzare la testa.

Però mi rendo conto che in altri tipi di lavori questi ragionamenti potrebbero essere più difficili da fare.",0,1410178885,null,0,false,0,ckce4n9,t3_2fstts,t1_ckce4n9,t3_2fstts,null,1427127861,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3
