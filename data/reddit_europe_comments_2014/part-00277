Daher auch mein Verweis auf die Geschichte mit der &lt;schlechter Artikel&gt;, da das kein politisches Thema ist und objektiv falsch. Da wurde einfach die ganze Zeit völlig unsubstantiell suggeriert, es könnte doch was dran sein. Mehrfach, obwohl alles an diesem Typen nach Betrüger roch.

En particulier sur les jihadistes, le paragraphe complet est le suivant :

Nous savons que près de 1000 djihadistes disposant de la nationalité française sont partis combattre en Syrie et en Irak et que beaucoup ont rallié le califat islamique. **Nous ne devons pas les considérer comme des égarés mais comme des ennemis qui reviendront bientôt en France, forts de leur expérience militaire, l’esprit affranchi de toute limite après les exactions commises (viols, tortures, décapitations).**

Nous devons les éliminer in situ et ce devrait être le rôle de nos services spéciaux de s’en occuper dès maintenant. Nous ne pouvons prendre le risque d’attendre qu’ils reviennent. **Arrêtés et emprisonnés en France ils seront de puissants moteurs de conversion à l’islam dans les prisons et donc un facteur supplémentaire de propagation du fondamentalisme islamique dans notre pays.** Il revient la responsabilité à chaque nation européenne (France, Royaume Uni…) d’éliminer ses ressortissants djihadistes avant qu’ils ne reviennent.

Cette conclusion me parait évidente : on élimine les combattants du camp d'en face qui nous font la guerre et risquent de venir la faire sur notre territoire. Il faudrait faire quoi ? Attendre qu'ils reviennent plus déterminés et aguerris ? On doit tout faire pour qu'ils ne reviennent pas, et s'il faut les tuer, c'est la règle de la guerre : on élimine le camp d'en face.

It would also be less if the UK would push in favor of some policies instead of blocking everything.

&gt;Despite that the UK is still one of the largest net contributors.

Outclassed by much smaller countries like Denmark, Finland or the Netherlands.

&gt; Rural Development is only 1/4 of CAP.

It shows that it's very much possible to improve the CAP rather than taking a black or white position. The old CAP that was the excuse for the rebate is gone for 71,5%; and that's not even counting the changes to the subsidy system. When is the UK going to propose to reduce the effect of the CAP by 70%?

Besides, Latium per se is one of the few regions totally devoid of any independence movement: the only shining moment of our history was 2000 years ago and since then we have mattered very little on the international, or even domestic, stages. We're mostly renowned for our earthy cuisine, the fact of speaking a bunch of dialects which are widely regarded as silly (or unpleasant) and generally lacking a well-defined, separate culture.

In other words we're just ordinary Italians and little more... the very idea of becoming something else is pointless.

One of them was a guy from Tajikistan. He was returning home after morning prayers and got attacked by a group of white (Finnish?) men at a railway station. He didn't even know why they attacked and what they were saying while punching him because he was pretty new in Finland and couldn't speak the language. 

Another one was a guy from Iraq. He got attacked by three men. They called him a nigger and accused him of ruining their country. They had a knife and tried to stab him but he managed to run away.

Finland is a peaceful country, the crime rate is very low and your average Finnish Jussi would never think of attacking a foreigner but every now and then you can hear stories like these ones.

&gt;Independence is about the right of a people to govern themselves and be a sovereign nation. It isn't meant to be used as a trick for (technically) stealing territory and re-drawing the borders of existing countries. 

Exactly, Serbs want to govern themselves and not be governed by others. It has been a centuries long dream for Serbs to live in one, united country.

Il motivo per cui gli ISP americani stanno spingendo tanto per distruggere la net neutrality (ovvero: la rete è _neutra_ e trasporta i dati secondo protocolli specifici _senza_ curarsi dell'origine o della destinazione) è che il crescente uso di servizi a banda ‘pesante’ ha messo in luce tutta una serie di cose tipo:

* la truffa totale dei contratti con cui vendono il servizio (“fino a” 4Mbps, ma in realtà se tutti nella tua zona usano l'ADSL sei fortunato se ci fai 80Kbps);
* i _miliardi_ di finanziamenti statali e federali che si sono mangiati senza fare gli upgrade delle linee per cui quei fondi erano stati stanziati;
* l'insostenibilità delle situazioni di _monopolio di fatto_ che sono riusciti a raggiungere usando i suddetti fondi per fare lobbying a livello locale e federale per impedire lo sviluppo delle reti municipali.

true,HereForTheFish,native-standard,native (Mitteldeutsch),"Unfortunately I can't read all of the handwriting, but I'll give it a shot. I'll do this column by column, although a few of them are quite obvious, I guess.

* The first column (Reihezahl) is simply a running number of entries in the register.

* The second column indicates day, month, and year of birth (Tag, Monat und Jahr der Geburt). The year is written as a number and additionally spelled out (neunzehnhundertfünf) 

* The next column indicates the first name. 

* The two small columns indicate the sex (Geschlecht). It seems that this is supposed to be used as a checkbox, but instead they wrote it out.

* The same goes for the next two columns (Eigenschaft), which indicate whether the child was born in wedlock or not (ehelich or unehelich).


* The two big columns contain info on the parents. The first gives first and last name, character (whatever they mean with that), place of birth, and the community and country with competent jurisdiction. The entry reads: ""*Israel Moses Miller, [unreadable, sorry], born on the 5th of november* (?) *1869 in Ruczacz* (?) [unreadable], *son of Nathan Miller and Golde-Malke* (?), *née Pines*""

* The mother's entry reads ""*Ruchel Fitzer, [unreadable] born on the 18th of november 1872 in Zastauna*(? could also start with an L. Maybe there's also an r in there)*, daughter of Jüdel Fitzer and Chaje*(?)""

Next page:

* The first column indicate the place of birth. It says Vienna, 5th district, and a street that I can't decipher, the house had the number 54.

* The next column gives the name and address of the midwife, I can't read the first name but her last name was Heitler and she lived in Vienna's 14th district, again I can't read the street.

* The next column indicates the date of circumcision and name-giving (May 14th) as well as the name in Hebrew.

* Now the next column, which you specifically asked for, indicates the name of the person who did the circumcision (the local Rabbi, I guess?), M. Schorr.

* The next column gives the name, character, and address of a witness. Whether this means a witness of the birth or the registration I can't tell. I can also only read the name, Jacob Pfeffer. Maybe a friend of the family? 

* The very last column (Remarks) says ""*The parents of the child entered marriage on the 23rd of November 1904* (not 1940!) *in* and then probably comes the synagogue, but I can't read that, sorry. But they married in Vienna.

I hope that helped. Maybe someone with more experience in reading old handwriting can fill in the gaps.

London ist dynamisch ~~sowie~~ ***und*** angenehm.

Ein anderer Nachteil des Stadtlebens sind die Verkehrsstaus. Man kann viel Zeit im Stau auf dem Weg zur Schule vergeuden (sounds slightly ancient, maybe that's a popular word in the south, ""verlieren"" seems better for me). Um den Verkehr zu verbessern, würde ich mehr Straßen ~~zu machen~~ bauen, obwohl das eine Menge Geld kosten würde. Außerdem ist die Stadt zu laut.

true,prodosser,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;It would also be less if the UK would push in favor of some policies instead of blocking everything.

The UK doesn't block everything. The UK has 10% of the seats in the EU Parliament, those 10% can't outvote anything without support of other countries MEPs. David Cameron vetoed the proposed amendment of EU Treaties because he couldn't get an opt-out of the Financial Services Tax. This tax would effect the UK much more than other countries as the UK has the largest financial services industry. The Digital Single Market, for example, supported by the UK Govt to increase employment and make the single market more effective. 

&gt;Outclassed by much smaller countries like Denmark, Finland or the Netherlands.

The UK contributions are still much larger than these in absolute terms. The UK pays in more than enough.

&gt;It shows that it's very much possible to improve the CAP rather than taking a black or white position.

If CAP contributed to making the single market more effective or efficient then it would be different. But it does the opposite. 

When the UK acts in its own interest it's always vilified as the bad guy, when Germany or France do it no one cares or notices. If the EU stuck to regulating trade and overseeing the single market it would be much more popular in Britain. Subsidising inefficient farming is one example of why the EU needs serious reform.

Ich versteh schon wie du das mit den Dreads meinst - so viele Haarstile, da wird doch wohl ein Afro mittendrin nicht auffallen, oder Dreads/Cornrows bei Schwarzen Deutschen. Dreads und Cornrows aber sind grundsätzlich schonmal nicht als ""gepflegter Haarstil"" anerkannt. Natürliches Schwarzes Haar aber auch nicht. Und wenn alle anderen ihre Haare gepflegt (gewaschen, gekämmt, ordentlich geschnitten) und natürlich tragen dürfen, dann ist es absolut Diskriminierung, wenn man die Haarstruktur Schwarzer Deutscher nicht akzeptiert.

This terribly simplistic and naive outlook on liberal democracies' inner workings fails to grasp the end, the purpose of it all, which is none other than to protect everyone from tyranny, from abuses of their rights. The decimononic ideal of the nation-state has proven its destructiveness in our very continent, and yet it is being brought back to life again, as a major threat to an institution coincieved to end the poisonous influx of identitarism. In the Spanish case in particular, there is a tremendous ignorance as to how our institutions and laws work, and there is a neverending stream of irrational messages that essentialy assume the most democratic course of action for the Spanish government is to knowingly break the law. Our Constitution explicitly forbids to take as sovereign subjects one or a group of individuals, as the sovereignty resides on all of us together.

What I contend is that a proper rule of law, with elected powers, that protects our rights and freedoms, that guarantees justice, is the most fundamental value of the system we've come to know as democracy. The other interpretation, that what matters most is the will of 50.1% of the people, that anything voted is more valuable than the protections set forth to make us free from the tyranny of the many - a very real possibility -, is no more than a flawed misread of the dictionary or a purposeful misrepresentation of facts to push a juridically illegitimate cause.

- inoltre, se i provider sono autorizzati a ridurre selettivamente la velocità di navigazione per alcuni siti, possono anche vendere contratti premium per poter navigare velocemente su certi siti\servizi, tipo hulu o netflix, realizzando guadagni ulteriori

true,jtalin,EURO,European Federation,"&gt; But it's not someone else's land, it's our land we want to separate and join with another.

Currently, it is legally Bosnia's land.

If you gain independence, it could legally be The Serb Republic land. As you said, the land does belong to you, no one can really dispute that.

But it can never legally be Serbia's land, because they are a completely separate legal entity. Besides, I believe that's even part of a treaty signed by Serbia after the Yugoslav Wars. They have given up the claim to your land.

&gt; Exactly, Serbs want to govern themselves and not be governed by others. It has been a centuries long dream for Serbs to live in one, united country.

Serbia already governs itself. Your (potential) country is a separate entity - that should also have the right to govern itself as a sovereign state, in my opinion at least. But you are still two different legal entities, and I don't see a way for that to change anytime soon in any way that will be internationally recognized. 

You have to realize that there have been many similar dreams in Europe, and most of them will have to remain unfulfilled forever. 

&gt; I don't understand this sentiment at all — you can separate, but not join your brothers.

Because that sentiment can - and will be - abused as a way for countries to grab land that does not belong to them. Much like what Russia is trying to do these days, for example.

Here's the thing - not too long ago, we were in a situation where every ""separatist"" movement was deemed criminal and faced prosecution by armed forces of the home nation. We have finally made it to the point where modern democracies are becoming more and more open to self-determination as a democratic right. 

So for the sake of fostering and preserving that right for all future (legitimate) causes, it should only be reserved to people who truly want independence - who believe in their own country and want to govern themselves and exist as a separate, sovereign nation. 

What you want is not independence. What you want is to leave one country and join another. This is extremely unlikely to ever be allowed, because it sets too dangerous a precedent. Border regions of **every** country in Europe could be become a diplomatic issue.

Estimates aren't numbers based out of one's ass.

&gt;Second, read the paragraph to see what it took for some Serbs to 
return.

The point was that they, in fact, returned. These kinds of facts are extremely rare in Republika Srpska. 

&gt;Third, nice use of percentages there! The Serb population increased... Nope! Before war there was 17'000 Serbs there, now there's 11'000.

1991 Population of Bosnia: 4,377,033
2013 Population of Bosnia: 3,791,662

A change of -585,372 people. The population of the entire country dropped.

Can you not provide sources in Cyrillic? I don't make you read Croatian so don't make me read Serbian.

&gt;Point me to where exactly in the PDF'd Power Point Presentation you linked me to is that number listed and precisely what methodology was used?

You can do the research yourself if you're that interested.

&gt;And of course, let's not forget about the Ottoman rule in which Muslims (Bosniaks) were side by side with Turks and the WWII genocide against the Serbs.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Yugoslavia

Speaking of Bosniaks. Serbs love to massacre Bosniaks left and right for some reason. In that list, they surpass the Ustashe in number killed and almost match them in number of massacres.

Funny, because you keep implying that Serbs are the ""victims"".

Also, you sided against Bulgaria many times during their independence struggle against the ottoman empire because you wanted to be the ""largest nation in the Balkans"". So, fuck off with the ""sided with the Turks"" bullshit.

I first heard about basic income in 2010 if i remember well, where I randomly met some french bloggers in a bar. The idea popped out in the discussion, and I immediately liked it. Later on, I started writing some articles about it on my [old blog](http://tetedequenelle.fr) and later as a journalist. 

Further, I was contacted by french speaking german man who informed me that a European Initiative we being prepared. We met and decided to join the organisation at a meeting in Brussels. After this, I felt like it was my duty to help organising the campaign. I offered to organise the next European meeting in Paris in july 2012, and since then, I have been increasingly dedicating myself into the movement – both at the European and French level (We created the French Movement in 2013, in order to participate to the EU campaign)

What makes me keep doing it?

First, passion. I just love the idea because it really provides relevant answers to many problems rooted in our society. 
Second, people (or maybe this one is first): the idea of basic income gathers very very nice, smart and fun people, with very different backgrounds as well. The diversity and solidarity among basic income supporters is astonishing.

Because in fact, everyones wants to have a fulfilling/meaningful activity, everyone wants to do something with his/her life. Everyone wants to feel this nice sense of being useful for the others, contributing to society.

The question is therefore whether money (and the risk of falling into poverty if you lack of it) should be the necessary &amp; unique incentive for people to find their own way of contributing to society?

I don't think so.

Pas en France. La natalité française reste forte contrairement à la majorité de l'Europe. Et au lieu de l'immigration on peut consacrer d'autres moyens pour soutenir la natalité. L'immigration n'est absolument pas la seule solution.

true,Enno_Schmidt,null,null,"It must be existing money mainly. The purchasing power must be maintained approximately. If a basic income is introduced, the wages and salaries no longer have the object of livelihood. If all have a basic income, it is very likely to come to new wage negotiations. The wages, benefits, fees are expected to decrease by approximately the amount of basic income. This reduces the cost of producing goods and services. The competition in the market will ensure that the lower costs are included in the prices. On prices can be placed a fee for the basic income. On average, across all industries, prices must thus remain approximately at the same level as before. The basic income is not much more money, but it makes the level of the basic income for everyone unconditionally and democratically granted as a right. All taxes end up in the prices for the consumer. This is the case today. This is rightly so. But that is invisible today. If you pay for a product, then you pay the income of all those who have participated in the preparation of the product. The tax you pay is the income of those who have created the conditions for production. Education, security, law and so on. These are the public service missions. A public object is also the basic income for all. The consumer pays. Consumers, we all are. What is a transparent tax? What is a democratic tax? What is a fair tax? What is the tax in the era of globalization? Which tax is due to division of labor? Which tax allows for initiative? The income tax dates from the time of self-sufficiency. The income tax acts as if the strong carry everything. But the money for income tax comes from the prices that consumers pay. The income tax acts as if the yield of my work is my income. But the product of my work is its benefit to others. The income tax insists that I take something out from the society with my work or which I have to pay taxes. This is a false notion of work. Environmental taxes are a way, resource taxes. But they flow in the prices and are paid by the consumer. 
Therefore, my suggestion is that the money for the basic income on the prices to be transferred. The money comes from the existing income and becomes in a basic income unconditionally and democratic money, a democratic income. The only question is, who is the democracy.
In other words, the basic income is already funded. For we live not by money, but of goods. This sounds too simple. But it is true that there is no shortage of goods and that does not lack money. And as long as we are so productive there is not a shortcoming. So there is enough for all. It's all about a transformation of the livelihood of a means of extortion in a guaranteed life basis.

It should be complemented by other benefits, like unemployment benefits, housing benefits, disabled benefit, pensions.

From this basis, we can gradually increase the basic income, along with further reforms of the tax-benefit system, until we reach a 'high enough' basic income for everyone to live in dignity and participate in society without being forced to search for a 'job'.",0,1411155284,null,0,false,0,ckn0rtc,t3_2gvq7d,t1_ckn0rtc,t1_ckn0eak,null,1426918395,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

&gt;Serbs love to massacre Bosniaks left and right for some reason. In that list, they surpass the Ustashe in number killed and almost match them in number of massacres.

&gt;Funny, because you keep implying that Serbs are the ""victims"".

What is also funny is how you completely disregard the entire history of Ottoman rule under which Serbs and Croats were treated as second-class citizens, while Muslim converts got tax-breaks and bigger rights. For the price of siding with the occupier.

You have to live under these conditions for hundreds of years. The WWI breaks and Serbia enters and exits on the winning side, but lets grievances go and accepts into a new Southern Slav country Bosniaks and Croats who entered the war on the losing side — who fought with the occupier, but now welcome Serbs with open arms (e.g. Zagreb 1918).

Then twenty years later they back-stab you, Croatia sides with the Axis, Ustashe Croats commit genocide against Serbs, some Bosniaks siding with them. Of course, there were Bosniaks and Croats in the partisans too, but a lot of them entered the partisans after Italy capitulated.

Serbs, again, let the grievances go and a new Yugoslavia is formed. Fifty years later, you start yelling ""We're oppressed by the Serbs!"". No, you're not oppressed, you live in a country that is 40% Serb (Yugoslavia).

Then Bosniaks catapult Bosnia into war because [""Izetbegović wants a unified Bosnia""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_plans_offered_before_and_during_the_Bosnian_War), fucking up the only deal on which all sides agreed and which could have saved Bosnia (Carrington–Cutileiro). Of course, he wanted unified Bosnia because Bosniaks are ~40%. So Yugoslavia with 40% Serbs is bad, but Serbs should accept to live in 40% Bosniak Bosnia.

People, women in particular, increasingly engaged in informal agriculture activity. Thanks to the basic income they could buy some chicks or goats and grow their own food instead of buying it to other merchands. Therefore new suppliers were born 'overnight'.

People did that because it was in their own interest. It was emancipating to grow their own food instead of relying from others.

On other thing to remember, unless financed by money creation, a basic income does not mean 'more money (demand) to everyone'. For most households, the basic income will be fully 'clawed back' via taxes, making the net income of the household unchanged.

Speaking of more developed countries is another story of course.

Grace O'Malley (c. 1530 – c. 1603; also Gráinne O'Malley,[1] Irish: Gráinne Ní Mháille) was Queen of Umaill, chieftain of the Ó Máille clan following in the footsteps of her father Eoghan Dubhdara Ó Máille. Upon his death, she inherited his large shipping and trading business (sometimes accused of being a piracy trade). The income from this business, the land inherited from her mother, and the property and holdings from her first husband, Dónal an Chogaidh Ó Flaithbheartaigh, allowed her to become very wealthy (reportedly owning as much as 1000 head of cattle and horses).

 In 1593, when her sons, Tibbot Burke and Murrough O'Flaherty, and her half-brother, Donal-na-Piopa, were taken captive by the English governor of Connacht, Sir Richard Bingham, O'Malley sailed to England to petition Elizabeth I for their release. She formally presented her request to Elizabeth at her court in Greenwich Palace.

After much talk, the two women came to an agreement. Included in the stipulations for each party, Elizabeth was to remove Sir Bingham from his position in Ireland and O'Malley was to stop supporting the Irish Lords' rebellions.

 The meeting seemed to have done some good for Richard Bingham was removed from service. However, several of O'Malley's other demands (including the return of the cattle and land that Bingham had stolen from her) remained unmet and within a rather short period of time, Elizabeth sent Bingham back to Ireland. 

Upon Bingham's return, O'Malley realised that the meeting with Elizabeth had been useless, and went back to supporting Irish rebellions during the Nine Years War. She most likely died at Rockfleet Castle around 1603, the same year as Elizabeth, though the year and place of her death are disputed.",0,1411157073,null,0,false,0,ckn1pb6,t3_2gvaxx,t1_ckn1pb6,t3_2gvaxx,null,1426917890,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Yes it could. Countries can join together, you know, into a single entity. That's pretty much how most of European nation states were created. (German unification, Italian unification...)

&gt;Besides, I believe that's even part of a treaty signed by Serbia after the Yugoslav Wars. They have given up the claim to your land.

It wouldn't be pursued if the Serbs in Serbia decided against it and if it would break any deals. I'm not familiar with the technicalities. We would carry on as a separate entity.

&gt;But you are still two different legal entities, and I don't see a way for that to change anytime soon in any way that will be internationally recognized. 

Funny enough: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1707

&gt;You have to realize that there have been many similar dreams in Europe, and most of them will have to remain unfulfilled forever. 

And why exactly?

&gt;Because that sentiment can - and will be - abused as a way for countries to grab land that does not belong to them. Much like what Russia is trying to do these days, for example.

But it's not grabbing lands that don't belong to you, if those lands want you to ""grab"" them, and if the people of those lands decide so in a democratic referendum.

What Russia is doing is done in an illegal manner.

&gt;So for the sake of fostering and preserving that right for all future (legitimate) causes, it should only be reserved to people who truly want independence - who believe in their own country and want to govern themselves and exist as a separate, sovereign nation. 

&gt;What you want is not independence. What you want is to leave one country and join another. This is extremely unlikely to ever be allowed, because it sets too dangerous a precedent. Border regions of every country in Europe could be become a diplomatic issue. Surely you can see this.

This is such a flawed logic, I can't come up with an answer. Of course I want to be governed by myself. That's why I want to join Serbia. I want Serbs to govern Serbs. I don't want Serbs to be split in two lands, in one of which they're a minority whose national identity can be trumped and whose will can be overridden easily.

I want a Serb nation-state, the same thing almost every other nation in Europe has. What is wrong with that?

You can't compare 2% of people in some border region wanting to *possibly, maybe, if it wouldn't be too much a hassle* to join another country, with the will of 30% of one country, the will of 90% of one region, to be united with their brothers with whom, they share the same history, same religion, same language, same culture..., and accomplish it by leaving a country in which the majority are those who have maltreated and oppressed them for the better part of their history.

If it will make you feel easier, look at it this way: We're the part of Bosnia who never wanted to separate from Yugoslavia, but we were forced to do so by an (unconstitutional) declaration of independence of the other nations in Bosnia. That is the best example of how the core of Serb identity can easily be overridden, the identity which all Serbs share, and the very reason they want to be united in one country. Those are the ideas of irredentism, pan-Slavism (which we've abandoned since we're the only ones who actually want it in the long run), non-interventionism, self-sustainability, independence...

The handwriting is actually quite clean and neat, you should see what sometimes is posted in /r/translator.  

I can mostly read the text, sometimes almost fluently, sometimes not. Often I have to do a first pass, and write everything down I can read, whole words and single letters if I cannot read a whole word. Then I go over it a second time, and try to match words that fit the grammar and context. Sometimes an uncertain word just snaps into place that way. Sure, after you know what it means, it's easy to see.  

Now, if I would have grown up reading and writing Kurrent/Sütterlin, I probably would have less problems reading that script. But I taught myself to read these scripts by trying (and *mostly* succeeding) to transscribe and translate these texts. There are a lot of different hadwriting styles, and some are easier to read than others. Seeing where one letter ends and another begins makes it a lot easier.  
Especially n/m/u, a/r/v/w, f/ſ/l/b, s/d look sometimes very close, especially in sloppy writing.  

If you look at the words you could not read, most of them are written a bit smaller and more compact than the others. With those it really helps if you can zoom in to see more details. It get's harder if there is no real sentence, and it's a list like in OPs post.  

For example, the street names I only got because I live in Vienna, and thus I could fill in the blanks between the letters I could decypher. Context helps *a lot*.  

Sure, others may be able to read that better, but I 'm still trying, but I also got some messages that I decyphered more than anyone before on some hard to read texts, so I think I'm doing something right.

I'm not saying people with basic income would 'work' as much as they do now, in fact if you mean the lions share of jobs currently available I hope they don't.

Once we have a strong European economy, all the rest will be child's play, but as of now Europe keeps on loosing its technological leadership, industries and jobs.

According to a survey by AP at the beginning of the year more than half of U.S. citizens believe the government needs to be rebooted (this is common in Europe but has never happened in the U.S.). Even former president Jimmy Carter has admitted that the U.S. is no longer a functioning democracy. In other words, people do not participate because they believe it is a scam.

First, there is the problem of gerrymandering. The boundaries that make up a representative's constituency has been so molested that they are almost meaningless.

Then there is the problem of SuperPACs. The U.S. Supreme Court decided that spending money is essentially an expression of speech and so is protected as free speech. This allows corporations, special interest groups, and uber wealthy individuals to dump unlimited amounts of money into a candidates bank account without anyone knowing where it is coming from. The libertarian-leaning tea party would probably be less aligned with a GOP candidate if they knew his campaign was funded by a few elites who stand to gain from less regulation and could care less about their libertarian or socially conservative ideals.

Next we have election shenanigans. Voter disenfranchisement exists where a group will attack other groups who are attempting to get more people to vote. More people voting is generally bad for republican party in the U.S. They would also like to raise the barrier to voting in an attempt to discourage certain groups from voting. Oh and we're fairly certain the last time George W. Bush was elected was complete election fraud but we dont talk about it.

Finally, we have the actual candidates. In the U.S. there are only two political parties that matter. Their supporters have great differences of opinion regarding fiscal, social, and political issues.  The two parties however, are essentially ""for"" and ""against"" the same things. They simply represent two different slices of elites and industry. The U.S. was completely fooled by Obama's ""change"" message in 2008 when he promised more transparency in the government, less torture, etc. 

Instead, Obama continued unpopular policies from the Bush administration, expanded the power of the President to wage ware without asking Congress, and used the State's Secret Act more than any other administration in the history of the U.S. He has twice signed policy allowing Americans to be arrested and detained indefinitely without a trial. He has had two U.S. citizens assassinated via drone attack (one who was 17 years old and born in Colorado). In the U.S., it used to be a sacred idea that anyone accused of a crime would get a trial. Hell, even the Nazi's got their day in court.

And this was the president who was supposed to prove that the U.S. government could change. Now that he has proven that it cannot, the majority of people do not believe any kind of reform would fix the problems. If reform can't fix the problems, then why bother voting at all?

Many so-called dirty work are very valuable to others and very useful. They are not dirty work, because the work itself is dirty, but because people are treated as dirt. With a basic income everyone has a better position to demand better working conditions. An economy that treats people like slaves, that people blackmailed people with their existence is inhumane and unfairly. An economy that is based on it should perish. Because this is a stupid economy. Because this is an economy at the expense of the people. This is not economic. That's feudal squeezing. The basic income creates more equal opportunities for all in the market. It regulates much about the market. This results in a free labor market for all. The basic income dynamizes the market. The basic income allows more individual need perception. It calls for more corporate culture. It allows for more variety and less bureaucracy. An economy that values ​​the people low and distrusts the people is ancient. The unconditional basic income breaks the monopolies. It breaks the rigid postures that you can do with people what you want, if they can not defend themselves. It's not about the creative activities. In all activities is creativity.

From Wikipedia: The most famous legend of Störtebeker relates to the execution itself. Störtebeker is said to have asked the mayor of Hamburg to release as many of his companions as he could walk past after being beheaded. Following the granting of this request and the subsequent beheading, Störtebeker's body arose and walked past eleven of his men before the executioner tripped him with an outstretched foot. Nevertheless, the eleven men were executed along with the others. The senate of Hamburg asked the executioner if he was not tired after all this, but he replied he could easily execute the whole of the senate as well. For this, he himself was sentenced to death and executed by the youngest member of the senate.

Also, what's with you people and one official language? That idea is disgusting to me.

Language is the most important part of one's identity. Your view of the world is shaped by your language. Your thoughts are shaped by your language. Preserving language diversity in Europe is the key to preserving diversity itself.

Having everyone speak the same language limits the possibility of free thought vastly and abandoning not only language but national identity for a supra-national one could homogenize Europe too much and turn us into almost clones of each other... (Similarly to U.S. There is diversity in the U.S., but only within a very limited uber-capitalistic, consumer-society range.)

My dream of Europe, whatever it may look like in the future, would be to be able to go to a pub in Prague without a passport, sit down for a beer with an Irishman, a Russian, a Swede and a Greek, each of us speaking our language and each of us understanding each other perfectly (without Google Translate implanted in my brain).

Of course, that's an almost impossible to accomplish dream, but preserving language diversity should be one of the most important priorities in Europe.

But as long as Europe is non-interventionist and doesn't force it's own ideology and view of the world on others, but rather tries to extend its message based on reciprocal, free flow of ideas outside its borders, and strives to preserve diversity as much as possible, I'm O.K. with it.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"To understand the root reasons, you have to really look at some of the lessons of Islam, and you can see that lesson in how Muslims pray. It's Brotherhood. The act of being One. Muslims all pray at the same time, they all say the prayers in the same language, with the same voice, all pointing to the same thing, their hearts are meant to beat as One, their minds think as One, their souls, again, be as One. You can see all of these things in something as simple as how Muslims all pray. 

And that forms a very strong bond. One that simply cannot be kept to one's religious beliefs, but one that is almost metaphysical in nature, that one cannot simply get rid of by moving to another country. It transcends everything, and it's such a strong cultural bond that even if you renounce your faith, you will still feel it. I've long since renounced Islam and while I was typing this post I kept accidentally saying ""We"" instead of ""Muslims"" or ""They"". 

It's an identity stronger than simple religious belief, even if it's not ethnic in nature, like it is with Jews, it's something altogether different. Don't get me wrong, a lot of Muslims don't really feel that, it's not a universal thing, and it doesn't really translate across denominations for a myriad of reasons, but it is a notable thing, and many, many Muslims *do* feel that way.

Esattamente come non vedo plausibile semplicemente non fare nulla e pulire dove è sporco (anche se il comune dovrebbe farlo). Costerebbe troppo, e ritornerebbe sporco in pochi giorni.

Comunque, ecco quello che farei, almeno per diminuire il problema: Educazione civica dalle elementari, in cui viene insegnato il valore del bene pubblico e perché bisogna rispettarlo. Controllore che effettivamente controlla i treni/bus, e armato di supercazzola se becca qualcuno a fare graffiti. (Non so quanto possano essere utili) ronde notturne nelle zone più ""a rischio"". Più pulizia, ad un certo punto diventa un ""tanto è già sporco, cosa vuoi che faccia un graffito in più?"". Incentivi a creare eventi/luoghi dove si fanno i graffiti su pannelli removibili, cosi se uno proprio deve farli almeno non sporca in giro. Pene per tutti i beccati (**tutti**) composte da pulizia e lavori socialmente utili. E visto che i graffiti di solito si fanno su muri ""puliti"", più graffiti di quelli fighi incentivati dal comune e fatti in pieno giorno e in piena legalità.

Ai disoccupati generalmente viene rimborsato l'affitto e vengono dati abbastanza soldi per sopravvivere dignitosamente, agli studenti universitari viene pagato uno stipendio (non prestito) di 500€ oltre all'università gratuita e priva di tasse, ai rifugiati politici viene elargito quello che si potrebbe definire un vero e proprio stipendio, a patto che partecipino ai corsi di integrazione e di immissione al mondo del lavoro.

RS is not the only place that does this. All of Bosnia has 3 ""languages"" on everything.

&gt;I, however, checked and there's no mention of your claim in the source you provided. I'm not saying it's not true, but it's misleading.

[Let me help you.](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=79.6%25+of+the+Canton+are+Bosniaks%2C+11.2%25+are+Serbs+and+another+6.7%25+are+Croats.)

&gt;What is also funny is how you completely disregard the entire history of Ottoman rule under which Serbs and Croats were treated as second-class citizens, while Muslim converts got tax-breaks and bigger rights. For the price of siding with the occupier.

Well, as a Croat, I can tell you that I am proud that the Croatian people served as a Bulwark against the Ottoman hordes. As a result, we weren't a part of the Ottoman empire for long. 

Unfortunately for us, we couldn't hold off [the Serbian hordes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Serb_Migrations) from occupying our land.

&gt;You have to live under these conditions for hundreds of years. The WWI breaks and Serbia enters and exits on the winning side, but lets grievances go and accepts into a new Southern Slav country Bosniaks and Croats who entered the war on the losing side — who fought with the occupier, but now welcome Serbs with open arms (e.g. Zagreb 1918).

&gt;Then twenty years later they back-stab you, Croatia sides with the Axis, Ustashe Croats commit genocide against Serbs, some Bosniaks siding with them. Of course, there were Bosniaks and Croats in the partisans too, but a lot of them entered the partisans after Italy capitulated.

&gt;Serbs, again, let the grievances go and a new Yugoslavia is formed. Fifty years later, you start yelling ""We're oppressed by the Serbs!"". No, you're not oppressed, you live in a country that is 40% Serb (Yugoslavia).

&gt;Then Bosniaks catapult Bosnia into war because ""Izetbegović wants a unified Bosnia""[4] , fucking up the only deal on which all sides agreed and which could have saved Bosnia (Carrington–Cutileiro). Of course, he wanted unified Bosnia because Bosniaks are ~40%. So Yugoslavia with 40% Serbs is bad, but Serbs should accept to live in 40% Bosniak Bosnia.

&gt;When you take into consideration that historical context, it is understandable that some people go crazy and demand retribution. I wouldn't, and I don't approve of it, but there are some who do.


Man, do you seriously expect me to believe this horseshit? 

And, for the record, Bosnia was on the road to war no matter what. 'Sloba' (your hero) started the disintegration of Yugoslavia. Your shitty people decided to end what worked for 40 years and started grabbing power. Oh, this isn't true you say? If you wanted to prove that all people lived equally and the Serbs weren't trying to turn Yugoslavia into ""Serboslavia"" then maybe you shouldn't have stolen Kosovo and Vojvodina's voting rights and added them to Serbia's voting rights.

I would say:

1. confidence is key to build a movement. Several time our network has been infiltrated by some really nasty, perverse people who could have hijacked the whole campaign. Only confidence among our core group of activists and transparency methods have proven capable of dealing with such issues. Therefore creating personal relationships with activists is key. Physical meetings are very crucial in that sense (which is very complicated at the European level, because of language and money issues).

2. Dare knocking doors. I was surprised that many members of the European parliament were keen on discussing and supporting us. With more resources, i am pretty sure we could have got much more support at the institutional level.

3. Social media help a lot, but you can't buy the victory. During the campaign we raised 22k euros to fund an online advertising campaign on facebook (and reddit as well!). It did not work very well, so we stopped the campaign. I guess we either lacked of skilled advertisers, and/or facebook ads really suck when it comes to 'selling' such a complex idea like basic income.

true,Jasperreijer,null,null,"Earlier this year I had the oppurtunity to meat with members of the European Commision in Brussels. This was the culmination of a series of dialogues the EC had with citizens across Europe. I can say from this experience that as far as the EC is concerned it is the only way forward. I rather doubt they even consider any alternative. So Brussels at least has already determined the course of the Union and it is a federal state.

As for whether I think it is likely...it is either a federal state or complete dissolution (which may even mean war). As stated, the politicians have already decided. They will accept no alternative. So if it falls apart it will probably be due to economic and cultural differences and internal dissension. 

My main problems with the federal scenario is that it will not be a federal state with limited powers on foreign policy and defence. There are too many people holding positions of ""power"" who have to look for things to actually have power over. Just ask yourself who is the european president. There are at least two to claim that position and possibly four. So they will look for things to fill their time and this will of necessity impede on the sovereign powers of union members.

Will the people accept this? Some will, some wont. My biggest fear is that this will destabilize europe as people take to the streets to protest leaders who have already demonstrably ignored the wishes and desires of their constituents. The wealthier countries already have a strong negative feeling about ""paying"" for the poorer countries, while the poorer countries think the richer countries throw their power baout too much. Combine this with already exisitng separitist movements, a  large disconnect in ideals between member states and you have a powder keg. 

Quite frankly they moved too quickly with the whole deal. Luckilly for the pro-federalists we have a conflict with Russia. Fear and a common ""enemy"" will keep the populace in line. For a while at least. We had a great deal going with the European Economic Community. They just couldn't wait to take the next steps in the same tempo they formed the economic community.

In Italy the common custom is to hold on to the seat of government with deep claws, sacrificing every ounce of dignity like useless weights on air balloons, in order to remain amongst the high clouds of wealth and power; so high that the little plebeians with their spleen and rage, and the tiny police and judicial systems with their dull charges of corruption and conspiracy with the mafia, or the so called moralists outraged that you fucked an underage whore and hosted one or two cocaine orgies, are but insignificant factors far beneath you, unable to touch your glory.

true,Supergiovane,lombardia,,"Assolutamente sì, e infatti l'entità del sussidio ai disoccupati è un argomento molto dibattuto. La soluzione finlandese consiste nel costringere il disoccupato a effettuare corsi di formazione periodici per un tot di ore, a presenziare ad eventi di reclutamento e a partecipare a tirocini. Se non segui le regole, smetti di ricevere il sussidio. Quelli che la scampano sono solitamente le persone che hanno un livello di educazione non specializzato o immigrati che non parlano il finlandese, che per ovvi motivi sono meno inclini al ricevere offerte di lavoro e quindi restano bloccati in questo meccanismo per anni e anni.

TL;DR: se ti trovano il lavoro, lo devi accettare. Se non te lo trovano, devi documentare che stai facendo tutto il possibile per cercarlo e nel frattempo ti danno un reddito sufficiente per sopravvivere dignitosamente. 

Inseriamoci poi l'aspetto culturale: il finlandese è abituato ad essere indipendente e a lavorare sin da giovane. C'è una microazienda quasi in ogni famiglia, a 16 anni il finlandese esce da casa, nelle superiori (liceo a parte) c'è il tirocinio obbligatorio, nella maggior parte delle facoltà universitarie ci sono 2 o più tirocini obbligatori e in più c'è il servizio militare o civile obbligatorio per un anno. Parecchi studenti lavorano part-time durante gli studi universitari, rinunciando ai 500€ mensili e guadagnando poco di più di quello che avrebbero fatto rimanendo semplicemente a casa.

Tutto sta nell'educazione. Se visitate una scuola elementare finlandese è garantito che porterete i vostri figli fuori dall'Italia. Visto che, se non si fosse capito, sono un appassionato di educazione, vi racconto un piccolo fatto. Mi è capitato di vedere che in alcune scuole elementari e medie vengono dati premi alla classe migliore. Arrivare tardi a scuola, non consegnare i compiti, prendere note, fa perdere punti... a tutta la classe. Con conseguente incazzatura dei compagni di classe. Per rimediare bisogna fare cose extra, come rimanere a scuola oltre l'orario previsto o dare una mano a pulire la scuola. Questo nel suo piccolo contribuisce a promuovere l'insegnamento che comportarsi in maniera incivile ti porta ad essere odiato dai tuoi simili. 

Ma secondo voi potrebbero mai fare questo in Italia? I genitori probabilmente difenderebbero il figlio emarginato. Poi magari arriverebbero le Iene e bum, succede il patatrac. Addirittura ho visto il caso di una scuola che necessitava che si imbiancassero i muri e ha chiesto aiuto agli studenti. I volontari facevano la fila: era la loro aula, è giusto che contribuissero.

If it were the equivalent insults to minorities there would be no doubt it's racism. But it's true that our society tends to say that there can't be any racism against the ""dominant"" people. On a related note, I have spoken and hung out casually with ""racailles"" on other occasions, and the amount of open antisemitism I heard from them is baffling. I've heard antisemetic remarks or jokes from average white frenchmen, usually quite timid. From these other guys however, it was proudly out there in the open, with not the slightest hesitation. Some of these guys are obviously full of hatred. Now surely I agree there are socio-economical reasons to explain it all. 

Anyway, I'd be surprised if most young whites in France living in or close to ""projects"" or ""ghettos"" haven't experienced this sort of racial harassment at least once in their youth.

I'll admit that this sort of thing hasn't happened to me in at least 5 years, now that I'm a young adult. I'm not only older (and this sort of thing, I think, typically happens to young people, as most hoodlums are also young and will target people in their age bracket), I also don't go out as much all night (because I'm over it now - too tired to party) which thus rarely puts me in a situation where I'd encounter those ""racailles"" who lurk around seeking trouble.

However recently, if you want a more specific story, a few months ago I had a racially heavy encounter (not a physically violent one, it's just my last experience of the sort). I work at the reception of a hotel. One client who was some 40 year old Arab French, who initially seemed nice, got mad because he claimed his pants were stolen from his luggage in the Hotel's premises. I felt I was being very understanding, polite and concerned, while trying to explain that I personally couldn't do anything about it, and he'd have to wait to speak to the manager the next day. Anyway he harassed me at my counter for 2 fucking hours, wanting some sort of compensation that I wasn't allowed to give in my position, and at one point dropped a ""c'est pas parce que t'es blanc et blond derrière ton comptoir que tu peux traiter les gens comme ça"". I was fucking baffled. Race card thrown in my face in front of tons of other clients to humiliate and degrade me. And by some 40 year old dude of all things.

Ahh, I didn't know the exact borders of the Sarajevo Canton, but now that I've seen the maps it's all clearer.

Apparently, there's some Serbs left in [Sarajevo Canton](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Sarajevo_in_Federation_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.svg/1074px-Sarajevo_in_Federation_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.svg.png) which was under the control of [Serb Army](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Dayton.png). Weird.

&gt;Unfortunately for us, we couldn't hold off the Serbian hordes from occupying our land.

The ""Serbian hordes"" didn't occupy your lands, but the Habsburg Monarchy and Croatian Parliament allowed Serbs into Military Krajina as a useful Europe-Ottoman proxy, as the article you linked to points out.

&gt;And, for the record, Bosnia was on the road to war no matter what. 'Sloba' (your hero) started the disintegration of Yugoslavia. Your shitty people decided to end what worked for 40 years and started grabbing power. Oh, this isn't true you say? If you wanted to prove that all people lived equally and the Serbs weren't trying to turn Yugoslavia into ""Serboslavia"" then maybe you shouldn't have stolen Kosovo and Vojvodina's voting rights and added them to Serbia's voting rights. When people got sick of your shit, you started bombing them.

Kosovo and Vojvodina didn't lose their voting rights, but autonomy. Vojvodina is majority Serb and there's no reason to be an autonomous region. In Kosovo, Serb minority was being oppressed, and that on the cradle of their nation, by the only non-Slavs in the country, who occupied the area after Turks swept in, and who weren't grateful for the big subsidies their, poorest province was getting.

&gt;Bosnia was 70% non-Serb and had every right to secede whether or not the Serbs liked it.

And so did the Serbs have the right to secede from Bosnia, i.e. remain part of what was left of Yugoslavia.

You also forget that [Croats wanted to secede from Bosnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croat%E2%80%93Bosniak_War) and a lot of them still do.

&gt;I can tell you that I am proud that the Croatian people served as a Bulwark against the Ottoman hordes.

And I'm proud that that's what the Serbs did too, until we couldn't hold them off any longer and some Serbs from areas of modern day Serbia had to move to Kraijna where-from to continue the fight.

So, my view is that they simply want catalans to forget about corrupt Jordi Pujol wit his fortune of 1 billion of euros obtained by blackmailing and coaction.

I'm happy that you have learned something, just look at wikipedia. (of course you will tell me now that wikipedia is bullshit, only truth is from batlic lithuanian version of history where Mighty Lithuania annexed weak Poland in Krewo, then in Lublin, but bad polish people forcibly polonized them, such a shame)

fun fact. It's well know fact that everyone could speak whatever language they want. Official language was language of officials(nobles, dukes, merchants) lithuanian was language of peasants. Just simple fact. In Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth most of the upper class started to learn polish instead ruthenian to comunicate with upper class from Kraków, Warsaw, or Lwów, another fact for speaking polish was good reputation of polish as a international language of Rzeczpospolita, just like english was official language of United Kingdom and now only few people speak Scottish, Welsh or Irish, but noone forcibly englinized them, they sure can speak their own language. They have even TV news in Scottish and Welsh

But I understand your point for Lithuania, when official language forces someone to speak their language, like polish can't even have own street names, and they got fines. 

But don't worry Poland is not like Lithuania, we are much more openminded and free.

PS. I forgot to add that Lithuanian language before XIX century was very different from what is now. In XIXc. most of the lithuanian words were changed into new, or old lithuanian, which noticeably changed the enitre language.

true,houad,EURO,Paris,"&gt; Anyway, I'd be surprised if most young whites in France living in or close to ""projects"" or ""ghettos"" haven't experienced this sort of racial harassment at least once in their youth.

I don't want to call you a liar, I believe your story at the end (sorry for you btw) but I really feel like we don't live in the same country. I went to school and *collège* in the red suburbs and I've never witnessed the least abuse directed at whites, at least not face-to-face. Meanwhile I see abuse towards blacks and Arabs all the time even though I'm white (things like who gets stopped by police, whom people think is not here legitimately, racist jokes to the face, unwarranted *tutoiement* etc.).

Yes, some kids in *collège* threw a lot of racial epithets around. But it went all ways. Everyone got the occasional ""sale X"" for pretty much every value of X, including regions of France and specific nations, including African nations. ""Sale Français"" was rare but ""sale blanc"" was common. It was shitty behaviour but I wouldn't call it racism seen as it was so systematic and ""normal"".

As for the ""racailles"", you have to realise that while you meet them all the time when you go out, they're not a numerous bunch, they just spend all their time outside. I can attest to the casualness with which they say racist stuff (mostly blacks vs Arabs but also towards whites whom they call ""les Français""), and to their frequent antisemitism, but they're not representative of anything. They're uneducated, they're extremely poor, they're unemployed, they almost only interact amongst themselves. It's no wonder they lack any sort of social decency (it's a vicious circle really).

In mainstream society, almost all the racism I've witnessed was towards non-whites (though not necessarily from whites). I have no idea what, say, blacks say to each other when no non-black's around, but I've never seen or heard a black person say something racist or act racist directly to a white, save those street lurkers.

true,ur-nammu,CROA,Mexico,"&gt;Apparently, there's some Serbs left in Sarajevo Canton which was under the control of Serb Army

So, the Serbs weren't ethnically cleansed after all. Would you look at that. They were allowed to even stay in the FBiH! The same cannot be said for Croats and Bosniaks in RS.

&gt;You also forget that Croats wanted to secede from Bosnia and a lot of them still do.

I beg to differ. Croats, as always, wanted equal rights. Of course we would ask the hosting country to give us equal rights. The anger within the Bosnian Croat community stems from the fact that they can't do shit due to Serb stubbornness to change the national laws. Bosnian Croats also would like to be in charge of their ancestral lands that are currently in RS. Did, or will, the RS government let them do that? Absolutely fucking not.

&gt;And so did the Serbs have the right to secede from Bosnia, i.e. remain part of what was left of Yugoslavia.

Lol. If the Bosnian Serb population was 0.1%, you would say the same damn thing.

&gt;And I'm proud that that's what the Serbs did too, until we couldn't hold them off any longer and some Serbs from areas of modern day Serbia had to move to Kraijna where-from to continue the fight. 

Serbs did nothing to defend Europe from the Turks. As always, you back-stabbed everybody in the back by working *with* the Turks.

Does the name of Ottoman hero [Kraljević Marko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Marko) ring any bells?

Does the [Battle of Nicopolis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nicopolis) ring any bells either?

And now you say you fought *against* the Turks? Boy, you are full of steaming bullshit!

You fought for the Turks, helped them conquer Europe, and now you complain about them? Fucking hypocrites, as always.

Du packst hier schon erstaunliches Schubladendenken aus. Ein Artikel über positive Aspekte der Amtszeit des Amerikanischen Präsdidenten steht zur Diskussion und der Artikel bezieht auch nur auf diese. Schön wie du daraus clever schlussfolgerst, dass dieser Artikel nur geschrieben wurde um etwas gegen den ""sogenannten"" d.h. für dich gar nicht existenten Antiamerikanismus in Deutschland zu unternehmen. Mit dieser Prämisse sind die Schlussfolgerungen natürlich zwingend logisch. Die Journalisten sind irgendwie pro-amerikanisch, das alleine macht sie schon verdächtig und dann _müssen_ - interessante Wortwahl - sie Artikel schreiben, die den Präsidenten zum _Messiahs_ machen. 

Du hast den Artikel ja gar nicht gelesen: 
&gt; Vollends peinlich wird es ja, als man versucht die NSA Affäre seinem Vorgänger in die Schuhe zu schieben und erklärt der liebe Onkel Obama habe ja Reformen angestoßen.

Vom Artikel: 
&gt; Und es ist legitim, diesem Thema eine große Bedeutung beizumessen und Obama aufgrund seiner Politik allein in diesem Bereich zu bewerten.

Klingt nicht nach Messias. Wenn man nicht in einer Parallelwelt lebt, ist auch klar das Obama den Status-Quo übernommen hat. 

&gt; Die beiden Komödianten sollten ihn mal direkt mit seinem Vorgänger vergleichen. 

Wir haben hier also keine Journalisten sondern Komödianten. Spassvögel, die uns verarschen wollen nehme ich an. 

&gt; Drohnenmorde, Guantanamoinhaftierte, unterstützung des mohammedanischen Terrors, etc.

Abseits der Verschwörungswelt sind nur die Drohnen prägend für die Amtszeit Obamas. Guantanamo wollte er schließen - das hat nicht geklappt... Alle Häftlinge in die USA verlegen und ihnen ordentliche Gerichtsverfahren geben hätte vermutlich so viel Dreck vorgespült, dass es nicht machbar ist. Mit Foxnews und den Republikanern im Nacken ist das schon eher kritisch. Aktiv unterstützt hat islamistischen Terror sicher nicht. Syrien ist unklar, aber absweits von Verschwörungskreisen gibt es keine Belege dafür. 

&gt; Mittlerweile wünscht man sich ja den Bush zurück, der war wenigstens berechenbar.

Was kommt nach Zynismus? /u/Krawll2! Bush bzw. Dick Cheney sind durchaus für vieles kritikwürdige Verantwortlich. Diese Regierung als besser als die jetzige unter Obama hinzustellen, zeigt doch nur wessen Geistes Kind du bist.

Firstly,  because legally  the sovereignty of Scotland belongs to the Scottish,  who established a treaty less than two centuries ago to govern their own affairs,  with more or less intervention from Westminster. Constitutionally, Spain sovereignty belongs to the whole of the Spanish people,  as established in Article 2 of the Spanish Constitution,  voted less than 4 decades ago. End of story. Catalonia is not a sovereign state the same way Scotland is. 

In addition, the independence movement of Catalonia is principally fueled by a negative economic climate. It's all about emotions and sense of despair rather than serious issues. Catalonia already enjoys a great deal of powers. Own police, own taxations and so forth. As a Spaniard I  still don't know what they're asking other than being independent. But still,  I don't know why they want to become independent. Let's talk about concrete issues and take it from there. 

 The recession enables people to look for solutions other than the ones given by the central government. Once the economic situation gets better,  nationalistic movements dissappear. To put it in perspective,  it's just an ephemeral movement caused by what is felt as bad policies by politicians,  not by a sudden raise of catalonian patriotism.

This seems to represent a point of divergence between US and European views of basic income. In the US, the strongest support for a basic income comes from people (including myself) who look at a basic income as a replacement for the current welfare system.

That brings up a question I have. One of the reasons that US BI advocates want to replace the welfare system is that US welfare programs have very high benefit reduction rates. It varies from state to state, but typically, for a person just below or just above the poverty threshold, the system takes back 50, 70, even 100 percent of what you earn through benefit reductions. That is a huge disincentive to work and a good reason to replace the current system.

v. curb

transitive v. To guide and manage, or restrain, as with a curb; **to bend to one's will**; to subject; to subdue; to restrain; to confine; to keep in check.

""We 'curbed' spying on friendly governments^1 ;).""

^1 We define 'friendly govts' as those that allow us to spy on them.

^2 ""We define 'Western Europe' as anything extending between western borders of UK and eastern borders of Canada.""

&gt;designed to give CIA officers time to examine whether they were being careful enough and to evaluate whether spying on allies is worth running the risk of discovery

""We need time to come up with a spying strategy that will go undetected.""

&gt;Under the stand-down order, case officers in Europe largely have been forbidden from undertaking **""unilateral operations""**^3 such as meeting with sources they have recruited within allied governments. Such clandestine meetings are the bedrock of spying.

^3 ""We define 'unilateral' as without explicit agreement from the top of the Agency.""

&gt;James Clapper, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said during a public event Thursday that the U.S. is assuming more risk because it has stopped spying on **""specific targets,""** though he didn't spell out details.

""We now spy indiscriminately.""

&gt; Spying stand-downs are common after an operation is compromised, but ""never this long or this deep,"" said a former CIA official, who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because it's illegal to discuss classified material or activities. The pause, which has been in effect for about two months, was ordered by senior CIA officials through secret cables.

""We told our 'retired' official to tell you that we're really taking serious steps. We told him to ask to be presented as 'top anonymous source' for more credibility.""

&gt;While the U.S. cooperates closely with Europe against terrorism, spying can help American officials understand what their allies are planning and thinking, whether about counterterrorism or trade talks.

""Guys, we really need this...""

&gt;European countries also are used as safe venues to conduct meetings between CIA officers and their sources from the Middle East and other high priority areas.

If you want a better life - a bit more money to buy a better phone or TV or something, but don't want to have to study for years to be able to do that, people can pick up an easy job in McDonalds or their local pub to fund it.

Also a lot of basic jobs are good training, even necessary, to go on to higher positions. The most effective managers are often those who've had experience in all areas of a business. Understanding how things work from the ground up can easily be a requirement to go on to better jobs. More desirable jobs would generally have some kind of requirement for prior experience, so people aren't going to automatically jump into their perfect job without having to work their way up.

Another knock-on effect of basic income would be that, because people would never be forced into a job they don't want to do, the less desirable jobs would have to have added incentive for the people doing them - for example, as you say, by increasing wages.

&gt;

&gt;The __Treaty of Utrecht__, which established the __Peace of Utrecht__, is a series of individual [peace treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_treaty), rather than a single document, signed by the belligerents in the [War of the Spanish Succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession), in the [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic) city of [Utrecht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht) in March and April 1713. The treaties between several European states, including Spain, Great Britain, France, Portugal, Savoy and the Dutch Republic, helped end the war.

&gt;The treaties were concluded between the representatives of [Louis XIV of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France) and of his grandson [Philip V of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_V_of_Spain) on one hand, and representatives of [Anne, Queen of Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain), the [Duke of Savoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Savoy), the [King of Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Portugal) and the [United Provinces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic) of the Netherlands on the other. They marked the end of French ambitions of [hegemony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony) in Europe expressed in the wars of Louis XIV and preserved the European system based on the [balance of power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_power_in_international_relations).

I don't understand the love for cash. I almost never use cash in the US. I have a bank account where my paycheck gets deposited. I then link my bank account to my credit card account so that every month, no matter if I'm traveling or asleep or dead, my credit card balance is paid off automatically without incurring any penalty or interest. I then proceed to buy everything that I possibly can using my credit card, with the only exception being cash for small local coffee shops and my barber. 

In return, I receive a ton of free points. I got 40,000 just for signing up and using my card, and I get points on every dollar I spend. This has allowed me to take multiple airline flights for free, train rides for free, etc. I've estimated that my points have given me over $1,000 this year in free travel through some great redemption opportunities.

There is literally no downside either. I build my credit, I don't have to worry about paying my bills, and all that is required is that I not buy things that I obviously can't afford.  

I've paid exactly $0 in interest, just like if I were using cash, but unlike cash I get free flights. Also, unlike cash, if my wallet gets stolen I don't lose any money - Visa does. And they go after fraud hard so I don't see any money leave my account at all. 

So to me, the benefits of a credit card far outweigh using cash. What do you like about cash?

Edit: a few points that I've seen made below. In the US all medium and large merchants take credit cards, and they are prohibited from charging different prices for cash or credit cards. If I use cash at these stores, I am effectively paying the ""transaction fee charge"" for the credit card pricing but getting none of the benefits. Considering that businesses aren't going to move away from credit cards, you are getting ripped off using cash.

I don't exactly favour cash, but I do prefer using an EC card instead of a Credit Card, for the exact same reason the article provided. We Germans just can't stand debt I guess!

With my EC card I can't overdraw, I guess if I'd use a credit card I'd be tempted to overdraw sooner or later.

Tant qu'on acceptera une telle immigration alors qu'il y a 8,5 millions de pauvres et 6 millions d'inscrits à Pole Emploi, ça ne risque pas de changer. Je suis content qu'on arrive à la même conclusion : stopper l'immigration.

&gt;On va faire une expérience de pensée : ton ""raisonnement"" revient à dire qu'un jeune de banlieue d'origine africaine entraîné dans une dynamique de délinquance mais ayant (boucle temporelle par la pensée hein, tu captes oui?) grandit dans un milieu socialement favorisé serait malgré tout devenu un délinquant ""racaille""

Non. Contente toi de me citer car on a déjà montré que tu avais du mal à comprendre quand tu spéculais...

&gt;C'est faire peu de cas des phénomènes d'émulation par exemple, positifs comme négatifs

Et donc avec 8 millions de pauvres et 6 millions de chômeurs tu fais quoi ? Tu mets les nouveaux arrivants chez les riches alors que les pauvres qui ont la nationalité française n'ont rien ?

&gt;mais la source que tu utilises pour appuyer ton propos ne dit pas que le facteur le plus important sont les inégalités de revenus

J'ai dit ""votre fantastique mixité sociale est corrélée avec plus de délinquance, pas moins de délinquance"". Le rapport dit :

*Au final, nous pouvons dire que cet indicateur d’inégalité de 
revenus est celui qui entretient le plus de liens apparents 
(superposition cartographique) avec les infractions constatées. Ceci autorise une hypothèse selon laquelle les inégalités de revenus pourraient contribuer à expliquer les taux d’infractions élevés des territoires concernés. Mais les données ne permettent hélas pas de mettre à l’épreuve statistiquement cette hypothèse.*

Je te rappelle que de ton côté tu as affirmé ""sinon ces zones ne seraient pas un terreau de reproduction sociale criminogène"" complètement gratuitement. En termes d'extrapolation limite divinatoire... tu fais fort.

&gt;Ah, donc tu donnes des sources contradictoires finalement, bin voyons

Et tu ne donnes rien.

&gt;Pourtant, ce que tu dis n’est pas vrai : ces études disent que l’effet est systématiquement faiblement positif, et sont cumulatifs .. rien à voir avec aucun effet.

C'est le contraire, l'effet sur les résultats est systématiquement négatif pour les bons élèves, et nul dans les autres cas, il es donc négatif au global.

&gt;De plus tu sembles oublier que l’aspiration première d’un enseignant est de faire progresser ses élèves

Oui donc ça implique de faire des classes d'élite.

&gt;c’est leur taf, ne t’inquiète pas

Oui donc quand on a 15% d'élèves qui sortent du primaire sans savoir lire, écrire ou compter et 40% qui ne maîtrisent pas la lecture, l'écriture ou le calcul, on peut s'interroger sur les capacités des enseignants.

&gt;’il est évident qu’une classe homogène socialement défavorisée nuit aux résultats scolaires

Les résultats montrent l'inverse : une classe socialement défavorisée ne nuit PAS aux résultats scolaires.

Encore une fois ton idéologie se retrouve contredite par les faits.

&gt;l’auteur conclu par ""toujours est-il que si la mixité sociale est associée à des effets scolaires plutôt positifs, ses effets subjectifs restent plus incertains""

Il fait cela sans aucune base rationnelle ni aucun chiffre pour l'appuyer. C'est son préjugé de départ qui se retrouve contredit par sa propre étude...

&gt;Tu t’énerves visiblement

C'est du mépris.

&gt;Il n'y a pas une seule étude française qui montre que la mixité sociale est bénéfique

Et je le maintiens. Les études ne montrent pas qu'elle est bénéfique. Les passages où il est affirmé qu'elle est bénéfique ne sont pas appuyés par des chiffres. Au contraire on constate que les élèves vivent mal le fait d'être dans une classe majoritairement différente de leur milieu.

&gt;Concernant la notion d’homogénéité de niveau (transcendant le facteur social donc), je ne suis pas convaincu de sa pertinence non plus

La période Giscard, c'est fini.

Sarkozy est un type grossier, inculte et imbus de lui-même, Hollande n'a rien pour lui : il ne sait rien gérer ou décider (qui pourrait dire le contraire), il ne sait pas communiquer.

Regarde les autres dirigeants du monde : Obama n'est pas forcément un génie, mais c'est un communiquant hors pair. Merkel (doctorat de physique quantique, donc c'est d'un autre niveau que la licence de droit de Sarkozy ou les diplômes obtenus avec dispense de Cambadelis...) est une politicienne hors pair, réélue deux fois, et une vraie stratège capable d'imposer sa vision en Europe, Poutine est lui aussi un très bon stratège. Cameron est nul mais au moins il agit et il fait des réformes.

Les seuls qui ont ce profil, en France (Christine Lagarde, Pascal Lamy), sont en périphérie du système politico-politicien. Donc on continue de voter pour des imbéciles, d'envoyer tous les cas désespérés au Parlement européen, et ensuite on se plaint que l'Europe c'est pas bien.",0,1411171486,null,0,false,0,ckn86pv,t3_2gv2pg,t1_ckn86pv,t1_ckmw1ik,null,1426914866,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

This seems like a super common misconception. If you use your credit card correctly in the US by paying your bill when it is due, the credit card company never has your money at any point in time. They give you essentially a 1-month loan at 0% interest, and then also give you free points or cash back. If you pay it off automatically, you literally never give an extra dime to the credit card company, but they give you free stuff in return. Add to that extensive fraud protection, free travel insurance, global concierge, and sometimes even exclusive access to clubs or airport lounges and it seems like a pretty good deal to me.

- The blatant disregard for language rules. If you queue up to a western server, be prepared to communicate in english. If you can't, then don't.
- The ignorance of server location. For example dota2 has western europe, eastern europe and russian as server options. Still it's just as likely to get a russian team mate in any of the three. This has lead to the saying of ""not even russians like to play with other russians"".
- The friendliness of the flaming. Being from a nordic country, I've taken my part in many a scandinavian flame war. Mainly swedes vs everyone else though (yeah, take that). It's just that the feeling is that of a family fight: you know they are still your buddies after you  flame them.
- General human psychology. For group cohesion there's always someone who has to be targeted with frustration and negative emotion. Be it the village idiot, the common enemy or just the third girl in a playschool yard, someone will always take the short end of the stick.

1) Catalonia is not a sovereign state, or has a history of being a sovereign state, as Scotland. This is 100% true. I mean, other regions in Spain with less ""independentist"" aspirations, have more history of being sovereign than Catalonia (Like Asturias, for example). 

2) While the separatist movement is nothing new, you have to admit, the fact that it became so much relevant lately, is mostly because of economic issues. It's not because of nothing than one of the most common mottos of the Catalonian independent movement nowadays is ""Espanya ens roba"" (Spain steals from us). I mean, seriously. 

I heard someone in another thread say something like ""The problem with Scotland is that the idea of the independence is very romantic, but the actual separatists don't have very strong and concrete plans on what to do after that"". This, in Catalonia, is very very true. ERC and CiU can't even agree on how they are going to present their project to Madrid. 

One of the main reasons the independent movement grew so much lately, is because the undecided were tempted by the idea of a better state than Spain, and the Catalan separatists promised that. 

I'm 100% for the vote, non-binding, and with a better wording, as in ""Independent, yes or no?"" and not the stupid crap about an ""associated state"" and that sort of thing. It shows lack of compromise. 

Also, if Catalonia actually becomes independent, i believe that 100% of the blame is how retarded Rajoy is. Don't antagonize people, negotiate and talk. At least, due to the economic importance that Catalonia has to Spain, they do get a lot more power. Madrid tends to ignore Euskadi and Galicia.

 [**German modal particle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%20modal%20particle): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;In the [German language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language), a __[modal particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_particle)__ ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): *Modalpartikel* or *Abtönungspartikel*) is an [uninflected word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninflected_word) used mainly in spontaneous spoken language in [colloquial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquial) registers. These words have a dual function: reflecting the mood or attitude of the speaker or narrator, and highlighting the sentence [focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(linguistics\)).

&gt;The effect that a flavoring particle has is often vague and dependent on the overall context. Speakers often use them somewhat excessively, and sometimes combine several particles, as in *doch mal*, *ja nun*, or even *ja doch nun mal*. They are a feature typical of the spoken language.

Citing the Wikipedia entry:

&gt; Thomas Risse and Tanja A. Börzel claim that the ""EU only lacks two significant features of a federation. First, the Member States remain the 'masters' of the treaties, i.e., they have the exclusive power to amend or change the constitutive treaties of the EU. Second, the EU lacks a real 'tax and spend' capacity, in other words, there is no fiscal federalism.""

In other words, tax money in Europe is still owned and spent by each country -- the EU budget is residual. This is where you see a real difference to a federation, like the USA. The Federal Budget is not only a thing there... It's the real stuff :-)

So, answering OP: no, I don't see that happening in my lifetime. There is too much difference between rich and poor EU members. The rich won't allow the simple transfer of money to the poor much beyond the current EU budget for development programs.

However, other things may be achieved more rapidly, I think:

- United armed forces. This will be quickly needed (as in ""now""?). Perhaps under some existing efforts, like NATO... But really, it's the only sane solution.

- A single Foreign Office. Really needed to end this alarmingly confusing state of affairs. See ""The Ukraine files"" if you don't believe me.

If you say those treaties are wet paper and Olivenza is a blatant part of Portugal as a result, then why is the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo (1848) between Mexico and the United States, that gives the United States sovereignty over the whole American southwest, any different? Or any other treaty in the world for that matter?

It isn't. There is literally no point to discuss about Olivenza, or that makes it any relevant to Gibraltar, other than falsely portraying Spain as a hypocrite and an agressor when the Gibraltar thing flares again.

As for Gibraltar and the Treaty of Utrecht, Utrecht says that Spain cedes the ""town, castle and port"" of Gibraltar to the United Kingdom (or to be exact, the British monarch). Technically it doesn't even cede sovereignty over the rock itself, but it was always assumed to do so. It doesn't cede sovereignty over waters other than the port either, but over the years the British Navy assumed control of the waters immediately around the rock and Spain didn't protest it.

Then in 2010, suddenly and from one day to another, the government of Gibraltar decided that up to [3 miles around it](http://img.rtve.es/imagenes/pesqueros-algeciras-evitan-aguas-gibraltar/1338286474994.jpg) were theirs and proceed to remove Spanish fishermen from the banks they had been fishing at their whole lives. And last year, it dumped concrete blocks with iron beams sticking out of then even outside that zone, to break fishing nets (and prove at the same time that it is not Gibraltarian fishermen they are doing it for either, because they make it impossible to fish for them as much as any other). All through this, the ships of the British Navy have been intercepting, expelling and sometimes even arresting the crews of Spanish ships in those newly appropiated waters. Even Spanish police and coast guards.

Spain's position is that Gibraltar, and through it its protector the United Kingdom, is evidently and blatantly breaking the last vigent treaty on the issue between the two countries, and it is the afflicted part in an illegal and unrecognized act of expansion by the other part.

La colpa del degrado sociale e' in primis degli italiani, i quali individualisti ed anarcoidi, sono in 'dovere' di abusare dei propri diriti in nome del proprio egoismo, esenti di altruismo.

Serbs are settled in this part of the country because after WWII the president of Yugoslavia settled serbs in unpopulated parts of the land, this including eastern Slavonija(Croatia), north of Bosnia and Vojvodina.

Also during the medieval times, in the time where Bosnian paganism was  spreaded in the whole country missionaries were sent from Constantinople to bosnia to g uide them into Orthodoxy and from Vatican to guide them to Catholicism. Most of these missionaries never got to central Bosnia where paganism still remained some time untill, almost in spite, most but not all Bosnian pagans took Islam as their religion. But it should be noted that Christians of that time also converted to Islam. That is why the eastern borders have a lot of serbs because under the very nationalistic winds blowing from serbia all orthodox people from Bosnia started calling themselves serbs and Catholics croats.

All the land that is now RS was always a part of Bosnia and never belonged to serbia and never will. The Borders of modern bosnia can be clearly seen on the treaty of karlowitz and also on the berlin congress where austria got the right to occupy the country.

The only redistribution will be at the unemployed, all their(official) income will come from the state.

Now, let me make myself clear, speculation with capital is not work and it certainly isn't investment. It is a flaw in a market it should not be protected but banned. There is nothing more protectionist that creating a system for a to big to fail company, that creates volatility in that system due to it's monopoly and when the volatility reaches a critical point stepping in to save that company. That is not a free market, we never had a free market at the macro level: it was always desined as a crony system where rich guys create value, pay politicians, give some jobs and in term politicians make them comfortable.

I hate UBI, I think it fundamentally desensitize young people from actually working. But I think our current social system in unsustainable and growing exponentially. I think trickle down has almost but killed the small business innovation, big companies basically hybridise with the environment, most new companies preferring to work with the big company rather than compete with it, making the whole sector vulnerable and more unstable in the long run.

Se usi Youtube, Netflix, e torrents, consumi la banda larga se si ha un contratto con limiti di traffico. 
Ora stanno  nascendo nuovi contratti da 100 giga mensili che possono costare cari; quindi piano piano gli isp stanno costruendo corsie 'preferenziali' con costi diversi. Ma gli utenti non vogliono che internet diventi un lusso dove per andare piu' veloce si debba pagare sempre di piu', specialmente quando pubblicizzi un contratto ""unlimited"".

Or rather, they taught the same material, but they didn't check any assignments that the students did. Since this isn't a high school, and a language institute can only teach and not deny your passing or failure, a lot of people slipped through by just ""riding it out"". The inburgeringen exam isn't that difficult per say. You just need to understand Dutch and be able to follow grammatical rules. 

They changed that system say, a year or so ago, because it wasn't working. The current system involves a lot more assignments and more hands-on approach. Apparently, previous assignments consisted of a student going to a Dutch person and trying to engage in conversation, then that Dutch person signing a sheet saying they passed.

That doesn't work with Arab cultures. 

I am Syrian, and here is a bit of a background on why it won't work:

Citizens of Iraq and Syria lived in a lot of corruption. Over decades, this instilled a mentality of wanting to ""cheat the system"". It's seen as a sign of manhood, of pride, especially in recent years. The only reason my father managed to erase it is because he lived in Bristol for a while and became ingrained in the culture.

So because of that mentality, the homework assignments that were given weren't successful since they would just have anyone sign the sheet and give them ""good"" grades.

Maybe that doesn't apply to all language institutes, but it applies to the one I'm studying in. One of my classmates had her husband study there before she joined. 

Currently, from what I hear, the Syrian minority is being perceived as being intelligent. They are having trouble mastering the language since they come from an Arabic and not an English background.

Yes. There is no argument to be had about this.

Already available overproduction, plus massive potential for scaling production at same or less cost is a reality. We could literally give everyone in africa and china enough money to buy adequate food and housing, though on that scale I'd see some short term shortages.

At least from the production at current price point side of things.

And of course, inflation would occur, if we were to simply print the money. That's how expanding the monetary supply works.

No, not really. Not *whatever* happens. Just things that are in line with the objective and perfectly obvious fact that has been no armed conflict between the US and Russia, ever. Things that seem to be happening very often as of late. Like there being no reaction whatsoever to that plane getting shot down a few months ago, for example. A plane full of NATO citizens that were murdered by Russian military. 

If the US sent troops to Ukraine and said US troops start putting bullets and other projectiles inside the Russian military's bodies, ending their lives, that wouldn't really confirm the ""conspiracy"", would it? In fact, it would outright deny any change of it existing, no? I'm still waiting for the US do do *one thing*, just *one*, on par with invading and annexing a European country that would suggest they have any real intention of countering Russian advance. If you are by any chance aware of such actions, like pouring artillery units into the Baltic states and strengthening the border, closing the Bosporus or...sending any significant number of troops to Ukraine that would suggest a serious intention of thwarting Russian advance, please let me know.

Let's be honest for a minute here. Do you believe that if there was any real possiblity of modifying the Constitution in order to allow a binding consultation in Catalonia (something that would require 2/3rds of approval in both the Congress and Senate, then both would be dissolved and a new Congress and Senate would have to be elected, these two would have to approve **again** the changes by simple majority and then these should be voted in a nation-wide referendum), anyone would opt for a non-legal way? 

Let's imagine for a second that Mas goes to the Congress and proposes the changes. A congress with a PP majority today and a pro-Spain majority in any given moment. What would they tell him? There wouldn't even be a discussion. That's what happened with *Plan Ibarretxe* in 2004.

The part of the Constitution that needs to be changed in order to allow a legal binding or non-binding consultation in Catalonia is almost impossible to change, because it requires almost all the political parties in the Congress and Senate to approve (2/3rds of approval in both cameras just to *contemplate* the changes, not to approve them), something impossible to achieve, given that PP and PSOE always have, between the two, the majority and they would never allow such a thing.

Ça empêche de facto les naturalisations nouvelles. Et il est possible de renoncer à sa nationalité par décret, tout comme il faut un décret pour être naturalisé en France.

&gt;Je l'ai déja démontré plus haut peu importe les loi voté ses individus auront tout de même la citoyenneté de leurs pays

Donc ils ne pourront acquérir la nationalité française. Ça n'est en rien inutile.

&gt;alors si je comprends bien la double nationalité pour certains et pas pour d'autres

C'est l'évidence même.

&gt;la tu changes la position de ton parti qui elle était pour la perte de la double nationalité pour tous les pays ou qui ne l'a jamais réfuté

Non. Relis le programme on accepte la double nationalité avec les autres pays européens.

&gt;Je veux savoir en quoi sa cause des problèmes avec des chiffres et des sources.. et non le grabuge qu'on retrouve a chaque coupe du monde

Plus des deux tiers des immigrés du Maghreb, 55 % des immigrés de Turquie et 43% de ceux du Portugal combinent la nationalité française et celle de leur pays d'origine. La double nationalité est significativement associée avec un plus fort sentiment d'appartenance au pays d'origine. L'assimilation française implique d'abandonner ses liens avec le pays d'origine.

On n'a pas de stats sur la double nationalité en prison. 

&gt;J'ai démontré plus haut que visé ses communauté est complètement inutile

Tu n'as rien démontré du tout. Tu peux le répéter, ça n'en fera pas une vérité pour autant.

&gt;Cela impliquerait que le pays d'origine ouvre leurs constitution pour satisfaire les demandes d'un pays étranger

Non. Cela impliquerait qu'on arrêterait éventuellement de donner la nationalité française à certaines personnes. Vu le nombre de doubles nationaux venant de ces pays, s'ils ne sont pas contents ils pourront faire pression sur leur pays d'origine, mais ça ne regarde pas la France. La France n'est pas un hôtel. Devenir français n'est pas une récompense, c'est un honneur qui se mérite et ça s'accompagne de devoirs.

Ce n'est pas de la faute de la France si certains pays ont une vision génétique de la nationalité.

&gt;Quand on regarde tes chiffres dans la section outlow on ne voit que ce sont 5 milliards qui partent a chaque année vs 15 milliards qui entre

Les chiffres sont visiblement peu fiables... Ce qui en dit long sur ton argument d'ailleurs.

Selon la banque mondiale, les flux sortants sont passés de 6 milliards en 2009 à 13,8 milliards en 2009. Mais on ne retrouve pas les mêmes chiffres que dans le rapport de la même banque mondiale...

http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPROSPECTS/Resources/334934-1288990760745/RemittanceData_Outflows_Apr2014.xls

Ils ne correspondent pas non plus à la somme des flux sortants des matrices, où l'on voit en 2012 19,28 milliards sortants pour 19,45 milliards entants :

http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPROSPECTS/Resources/334934-1110315015165/Bilateral_Remittance_Matrix_2012.xlsx

En 2011, 19,5 milliards reçus pour 20 milliards envoyés :

http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPROSPECTS/Resources/334934-1110315015165/Bilateral_Remittance_Matrix_2011.xlsx

Tu essayais de montrer quoi avec ça ? Quel est le rapport avec la double nationalité ?

Si on prend le cas de la Belgique, on voit que 3 milliards partent de France vers la Belgique alors qu'il n'y a que [113 000 Belges vivant en France](http://www.rtl.be/info/monde/international/1043287/le-nombre-de-belges-vivant-a-l-etranger-a-fortement-augmente-voici-pourquoi)... Ça fait 27 000 euros en moyenne par Belge en 2013.

Ces chiffres ne montrent rien  et n'ont rien à voir avec une supposée ""générosité"" des expatriés.

&gt;Sa n'empeche en rien que 1/3 parmi eux en Europe ont une double nationalité francaise dont 63% qui ne travaille pas pour une boite francaise 

Les pays de l'UE ne sont pas concernés par la fin de la double nationalité. Lis le programme.

&gt;que 2 millards de dollars viennent des USA ou 2/3 d'entre eux ont la double nationalité et 80% travaille pour une boite américaine

Et alors ? S'ils choisissent la nationalité américaine ils vont arrêter d'envoyer de l'argent ? Ça n'a aucun rapport.

&gt;Considérant France reçoit plus d'argent qu'il n'en part

C'est faux en 2011, marginal en 2012 et ta conclusion tombe à l'eau.

&gt;interdire la double nationalité risque majoritairement de pénalisé des citoyens français qui se trouve dans des pays proches ayant la même culture

C'est à dire quels pays ?

""La double nationalité avec un certain nombre de pays du Maghreb pose plus de difficultés d'assimilation"" qu'avec un pays comme les Etats-Unis.""

Qu'est-ce qui te permet de croire que les binationaux choisiront un autre pays que la France ?

2. The ones responsible for tourism are not good at their jobs. We almost lost the filming of GoT for reasons dumber than a second coat of paint.
3. People are generally lethargic and not interested in stuff like overturning a corrupt government. They'd rather live a shitty life with a crappy job and miserable paycheck than turn things upside down.
4. Because of the incompetent tourism people, you all know about Croatia's seaside only, where there is much more to this country.
5. Traffic is god-awful during the summer. 
6. If you want the same amount of fun for a fraction of the price, just go to Serbia. Those people are radically different and much more relaxed and easy going.
7. The summer on the seaside is basically all this country has to offer you, really.
8. Some things the modern world takes for granted are either non-existent here or frowned upon. Free Wi-Fi for everyone is slowly creeping in, though.
9. If you want to see Croatia, leave the popular, crowded places. Go fishing with the fishermen, visit the less populated islands, go hiking to Velebit. 
10. Don't think that people aren't good hearted and good-mannered. It's all because of point 3 we're mostly like that. People in Croatia when all is well are generally very welcoming, we want you to come and see this little gem on the Adriatic out dads, moms, brothers and sisters fought for until not that long ago (though some still refuse to let it go).

In terms of amount, half of the minimum wage is usually a good indicator, but i really depends on who you speak with. Every UBI activist has his own idea about it. Just to speak about France, basic income is often debated with levels comprised between 450 euros and 1000 euros. 

About restriction: **there should be no restrictions for receiving the basic income** (except being a legal resident of course).  

The unconditional part of UBI is key for this policy to work. Because conditions means social control, bureaucracy, injustices.

&gt; ""Entschuldigung"" as a means of getting someone's attention (or if they're standing in the way, for instance)

Yes, that's correct

&gt; Or is ""Entschuldigung"" reserved for something more immediate (I stepped on your foot) and ""tut mir leid"" for something more complex (I accidentally deleted your files)?

I don't think it is reserved, but it's more common to use it as you said.

&gt; What about sentences like ""Ich entschuldige mich für meinen Fehler"" or ""Bitte entschuldigen Sie (mir) meinen Fehler""? Which ones are ""natural"", which are weird, are any of these incorrect?

Both sentences sound quite formal to me, more like written language, but I think both are correct.

&gt; I've also found ""Entschuldigen Sie mich""

That's correct as well

&gt; When you say ""I'm sorry"" for something you had nothing to do with (like in ""I'm sorry for your loss"" or ""I'm sorry that happened to you""), what do you say? ""Es tut mir leid""?

You can say ""Es tut mir leid"", or when expressing condolence, ""Mein Beileid.""

&gt; I've never heard ""Verzeihung"" in real life

It's very rare, at least where I live. I think it's interchangeable with ""Entschuldigung"". but more formal. It might be a regional thing too :)

&gt; ""Verzeihen Sie mir"" without a complement, or is it incorrect like ""Entschuldigen Sie mir"" without a complement

""Bitte verzeihen Sie (mir)."" is okay, but it means ""Please forgive me"". ""Entschuldigen Sie **mich**"" is the phrase for going to the bathrom/leaving a conversation/...

&gt;  Like, ""Verzeihen Sie mir, wenn ich blahblah"" seems to work, but ""Verzeihen Sie mir."" doesn't. Is that it?

&gt;the iPhone has a market price based on demand and supply. it's not arbitrary. the fact supply is limited through intellectual property plays a role here. if anyone was able to call their product an iPhone, the price would look different.

No, it has a market price arbitrarily determined by the company, which is figured out by market reshearch.

Supply is limited trough distribution and strategy, they can easaly produce 150 milion and put it on sale after they stocked up all their shops.

The way it will be implemented means they would pay less per hour of labor, whether or not that labor is negesary will be decided by the manager, but most low end positions can  not be automated(/high rate of initial invesment) so businesses will stil need labor, and as the comenter said the exceding demand will have a limited supply therefor it will cost more to hire someone to do that particular job. That increase in cost is only acceptable as long as the business's total expenditure labor+taxes stays underneath the current levels of tax+labor costs.

For most bottom end companies raising prices unilaterally is not a option. However if the whole sector raises prices toghether, then you can survive even with excees costs. Now in practice the small ""cost managing"" companies are not the ones raising prices(they are to many to raise them in a organised fashion so no one looses), the big corporations that already have good margins are the ones that use systemic changed to raise prices.(because they can coordinate and also have the leverage of ""having more employees"")",0,1411205392,null,0,false,0,cknhvoh,t3_2gvq7d,t1_cknhvoh,t1_cknhazy,null,1426910234,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Und als sie die Chance hatte mit der Linken und den Grünen ein Regierungsbündnis zu bilden und anzuführen hat sie sich statt dessen ohne zu zögern der Union als Juniorpartner zu Verfügung gestellt.

So entsteht der Eindruck, dass man bei Wahlen nur etwas ändern kann, wenn man außerhalb des etablierten Spektrums wählt.

2. What /u/zergl said.

3. You have better control of your finances when they're material. Knowing your (approximate) balance and having solid 20€ in your pocket is not the same thing.

4. Credit cards encourage consumer society, which I see as the biggest problem of the West. They encourage you to buy shit you don't actually need. The points you mention work similar to discounts. When you walk by a store and see a 40% discount on an item you're more likely to buy it then if there was no discount, even though you don't necessarily need it, simply because you think you're getting a good deal. If there was no ""40% off"" sign, you wouldn’t even consider buying it. You didn't save 40%, you lost what amounts to the other 60%. The same goes for ""free"" points. You buy shit you don't need, so you can get points which will help you buy more shit you don't need.

The main point you have to realize about banks is, they won't do jack shit if it won't bring them profit. The same thing applies to credit cards.

* Although the crown was titularly ""of Aragon"", it was a confederation of proto-states, the most important of which was Catalonia. Each had different laws and currency, so they were, for the time period, independent.

* And then it got either sold out to the French or conquered by the Spanish. The end of an independent self-rule in Catalonia was in 1715, around 900 years after it started.

Die Ordnung die in Wien diktiert wurde hat nicht mal 20 Jahre gehalten, die Belgier haben sie 1830 mit ihrer Unabhängigkeit schlicht aufgekündigt. Das war auch nicht friedlich, dieser Konflikt musste neun Jahre später mit dem Vertrag von London beendet werden, der Großbritannien 1914 übrigens dazu zwang, in den ersten Weltkrieg einzutreten.

Nach den Belgiern kamen die Italiener und die Deutschen, die ihrer nationalen Einheit halber respektive drei und vier Kriege in Zentraleuropa führten. Irgendwo dazwischen gab es noch die Orientkrise und den Krimkrieg, denn die 350 Jahre lang anhaltende Fehde zwischen Türken und Russen beendete der Kongress ebenso wenig. Und ganz am Ende stehen die beiden Balkankriege, in denen die Kulisse für den Ausbruch des ersten Weltkrieges aufgebaut wurde.

Von den zwei revolutionären Wellen, 1830 und 1848, will ich gar nicht reden. Das größte Problem der Reaktion in Wien war nicht die Unfreiheit, sondern der Nationalismus, er war die Triebfeder für die kriegerischen Störungen im Machtgefüge dieser Zeit. Dass es nicht zu einem kontinentalen Krieg kam sondern die Kriege kurz und isoliert blieben, war übrigens kein Segen, sondern in sich ein Problem, denn 1914 dachten alle Teilnehmer der Julikrise, dass das, was sich als der erste Weltkrieg herausstellen sollte, genauso aussehen würde. Sie irrten.

Aus diesem Grund finde ich es auch schwierig, Wien als Blaupause für die Ukraine zu sehen. Wer nur auf das Gleichgewicht von Mächten und Interessenausgleich guckt, ohne ein Auge auf die Befindlichkeiten der Menschen in den Territorien, die als bloße Verhandlungsmasse gesehen werden zu haben, handelt sich massive Probleme ein.

true,AleixASV,ESTE,Deciding my own future,"&gt;Catalonia is not a sovereign state, or has a history of being a sovereign state, as Scotland.

Neither is Scotland today, that's what they were voting. Also it can be argued that Aragon was basically Catalonia under another name, with the Palace in Barcelona, the main language the catalan and the ruling dinasty being the counts of Barcelona (who were independent and formed the first Catalan state). Also you seem to forget that we have declared ourselves independent at least 3 times already, it wouldn't be new.

&gt;is mostly because of economic issues.

And that is wrong because? You also seem to forget that Madrid is threatiening our education, culture (look at the funding of museus in Barcelona vs Madrid for example), transports, infraestructure, etc.

 ""Espanya ens roba"" (Spain steals from us). I mean, seriously.

15000M€ in 2011 from our taxes were kept and given away at other communities while we are racking up huge debt due to that. Madrid *does* steal from us, belive it or not.

&gt;This, in Catalonia, is very very true. ERC and CiU can't even agree on how they are going to present their project to Madrid.

Sorry what? We did present the problem to Madrid a few months ago and I belive the answer to that was a huge *Noooooooooooooo* (also you can count our Fiscal Pact, l'Estatut, etc. as attemps that failed due to Madrid's intervention only).

&gt;One of the main reasons the independent movement grew so much lately, is because the undecided were tempted by the idea of a better state than Spain, and the Catalan separatists promised that.

Which you also seem to forget that it is widely accepted worldwide that an independent Catalonia would be viable, it isn't a ""seccessionist's dream"" (which btw, if you are pushing for independence it's beacuse you know it's worth it, nobody is so stupid).

&gt;I'm 100% for the vote, non-binding, and with a better wording, as in ""Independent, yes or no?"" and not the stupid crap about an ""associated state"" and that sort of thing. It shows lack of compromise.

It shows different oppinions, though I'd say you're right on that one. The scots by the way tried to word it like us, but Westminster changed the question.

&gt;Also, if Catalonia actually becomes independent, i believe that 100% of the blame is how retarded Rajoy is. Don't antagonize people, negotiate and talk.

We've been doing it for decades in democracy and centuries in Spain's history (remember La Mancomunitat? the Federalists of the XIXth century?) and it has always failed.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disputed_status_of_Olivenza

&gt;Despite that Spain also signed the Treaty of Vienna in 1817, restoring Olivenza/Olivença to Portugal. Portugal claims de jure sovereignty over Olivenza/Olivença on the grounds that the Treaty of Badajoz was revoked by its own terms (Which stated: The breach of any of its articles would lead to its cancellation) when Spain invaded Portugal in the Peninsular War of 1807, and foremost, due to the fact that Spain signed the Treaty of Vienna in 1815, which recognizes Olivenza/Olivença as Portuguese territory.

&gt;Portugal further bases its case on Article 105 of the Treaty of Vienna of 1815, which Spain signed in 1817, that states that the winning countries are to ""endeavour with the mightiest conciliatory effort to return Olivenza to Portuguese authority"". Thus, the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza should be as demarcated by the Treaty of Alcañices of 1297. Spain interprets Article 105 as not being mandatory on demanding Spain to return Olivenza to Portugal, thus not revoking the Treaty of Badajoz.

On ne peut pas stopper l’immigration. Même des [barbelés]( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barri%C3%A8re_de_Melilla) ne la stoppent pas totalement. On peut chercher à la réguler, ou la limiter, et c’est déjà ce qui est fait. *Vous ne servez à rien*. 

&gt; Non. Contente toi de me citer car on a déjà montré que tu avais du mal à comprendre quand tu spéculais...

J’aurai du me douter que proposer une expérience de pensée à un frontiste était largement trop optimiste.

&gt; J'ai dit ""votre fantastique mixité sociale est corrélée avec plus de délinquance, pas moins de délinquance"". 

Tu as aussi dit : *Le facteur le plus important dans la délinquance, ce sont les inégalités de revenus* C’est sur quoi mon propos portait. Je te montre la lune, et toi tu vois mon doigt.

&gt; Je te rappelle que de ton côté tu as affirmé ""sinon ces zones ne seraient pas un terreau de reproduction sociale criminogène"" complètement gratuitement. 

Oh évidement, j’oubliais que pour le frontiste le fait qu’un gamin maghrébin de 12 ans qui se retrouve à faire le guet pour du trafic de shit dans une ZSP est le résultat d’une vocation ethnique et n’a rien à voir avec un phénomène d’entraînement ou de contexte. 

&gt; Et tu ne donnes rien.

Inutile, tes sources suffisent ici, tu vois bien non?

&gt; C'est le contraire, l'effet sur les résultats est systématiquement négatif pour les bons élèves, et nul dans les autres cas, il es donc négatif au global.

Non. Apprends à lire.

&gt; Oui donc ça implique de faire des classes d'élite.

Ahahah :) Heureusement que tu ne t’es pas plié à la tradition familiale hein ?

&gt; Oui donc quand on a 15% d'élèves qui sortent du primaire sans savoir lire, écrire ou compter et 40% qui ne maîtrisent pas la lecture, l'écriture ou le calcul, on peut s'interroger sur les capacités des enseignants.

Bon, j’ai bien compris ton besoin de simplifier les choses pour te sentir à l’aise. Cependant, sans nier ou minimiser la prévalence de ce problème, à nouveau ce que tu dis est faux, ou du moins plus subtil que ça. De l’ordre de 15% d'élèves ont des difficultés sévères dans une combinaison de ces domaines, de l’ordre du déchiffrement et/ou de la compréhension. Ne pas *savoir lire* touche une proportion de l’ordre de 3 à 4%, ce qui est déjà trop. De plus, c’est un problème complexe dont un des paramètres est le niveau à l’entrée en CP. Dans les sources que tu citais et que tu n’as pas compris ils mentionnent le caractère  crucial de la condition initiale de l’élève à l’entrée dans un cycle.
Maintenant je comprends aussi ta tentation de mettre ce problème sur le dos des enseignants, eu égard à la haine que portent souvent les frontistes sur toute profession d’ordre intellectuelle. 

&gt; Les résultats montrent l'inverse : une classe socialement défavorisée ne nuit PAS aux résultats scolaires.

Juste un exemple (j’en reviens pas d’avoir à copier coller des phrases de tes propres sources pour te les expliquer) : 

""[…] ceux scolarisés dans une classe à **tendance favorisée** [socialement] progressent en moyenne de 2,79 points de **plus** que les élèves scolarisés dans une classe **homogènement défavorisée**"".

Y a même un chiffre, tu devrais être content. Je souhaite vraiment t’aider : c’est lequel de ces mots que tu ne comprends pas ? Ou alors il faut retourner la proposition logique, et que le mot *moins* apparaisse pour que ta petite ampoule s’allume tout là haut, comme :

"" les élèves scolarisés dans une classe **homogènement défavorisée** progressent en moyenne de 2,79 points de **moins** que ceux scolarisés dans une classe à **tendance favorisée**"". C’est plus simple pour toi ainsi ? 

&gt; Encore une fois ton idéologie se retrouve contredite par les faits.

C’est citer des sources et affirmer l’inverse de ce qu’elles disent comme tu le fais qui relève de l’aveuglement idéologique le plus crasse. Tu comprends que je peux aisément te retourner le compliment j’espère ?
   
&gt; C'est son préjugé de départ qui se retrouve contredit par sa propre étude...

Ahahah collector :) Je la garde celle là, tu permets ? 

&gt; C'est du mépris.

C’est tout ce qu’il te reste.. je suis triste pour toi. 

&gt; Donc tu n'as strictement rien compris aux études que tu as lues.

Je n’en ai pas tenu compte puisque je donnais mon sentiment personnel (*je ne suis pas convaincu*) sur un problème auquel j’ai déjà été confronté, contrairement à toi.. Le jour ou vous serez au pouvoir vous chercherez sans doute à empêcher que les gens comme moi puissent faire ainsi, mais ce jour n’est pas encore arrivé .. alors détends toi. 

&gt; Non, il faut les renvoyer en Afrique.

Pour qu’ils y crèvent ou en reviennent. Bienvenue dans le monde réel :)

Qu'on se définisse comme progressistes ou non on est tous d'accord pour dire qu'un jeune homme Noir est particulièrement à risque d'attirer injustement ou non l'attention de la police. Le biais raciste est explicitement relevé, connu de tous et âprement (à juste titre) critiqué, tandis que l'aspect sexiste fait l'objet d'un oubli complet puisque ça joue tout de suite le jeu des MRA et donc va à contre courant du féminisme inter-sectionnel. Et pourtant ça n'est pas anecdotique, je n'ai que les chiffres pour les USA mais de source officielle (US Sentencing Commission) à chef d'accusation égal on sait que le biais sexiste est plus fort encore que le biais raciste en matière de durée de la peine prononcée, par exemple.

L'analyse inter-sectionnelle je ne suis pas contre, mais il faut la faire jusqu'au bout et ne pas s'en servir comme d'un prétexte fourre-tout pour les minorités diverses contre le grand oppresseur blanc hétéro.

I wouldn't go as far as to say that all of Catalonia was the most important region of the Crown. Certainly Barcelona being a port city was the most important city of the Crown, strategically located for further expansion- but Catalonia as a whole was a mere municipality. 
The show was indeed mainly run by The House of Barcelona, but there's a reason why Catalonia's flag today doesn't have a coat of arms like that of Aragon, Valencia etc- It wasn't ever a kingdom.

However fascinating (yay history nerds!), the historical argument in my opinion is the weakest for independence of Catalonia. I think time would be best spent debating what will be done about EU membership, Schengen agreement (borders!), currency and whether issues of debt and corruption will be dealt with at all by independence.

Während die meisten Linken die katholische Kirche aufrichtig hassen und das Christentum ablehnen, wird der Islam meistens in Schutz genommen. Viele Linke können wohl nicht richtig zwischen Ausländern und Moslems unterschieden und vermischen die beiden Begriffe. Nur weil die meisten außereuropäischen Migranten hierzulande Moslems sind, heißt das nicht, dass das Verteidigen des Islams damit zur antirassistischen Tat wird. Ganz im Gegenteil, wer den Islam in Schutz nimmt, nur weil viele Migranten Moslems sind, hat die gleiche vereinfachte Denkstruktur wie der Ausländerfeind, der Moslems hasst, weil er denkt, dass alle Moslems Ausländer sind.

Wenn man sich anschaut, wofür gläubige Moselms eintreten, kann man sie eigentlich nur dem rechten Lager zuschlagen: gegen Abtreibung, gegen Sex vor der Ehe, gegen Alkoholkonsum, strenge Familienhirachien, eine untergeordnete Rolle der Frau, Homophobie, Antihedonimus usw.

Sehr unnütz ist übrigens auch die unter linken beliebte Unterscheidung von *Islam* und *Islamismus*. Letzterer sei Terror und böse ersterer sei friedlich und gut. Als Religionskritiker kann ich mit dem Islam nicht mehr anfangen, nur weil seine Anhänger darauf verzichten Teenagern Bombengürtel umzuhängen. Die oben genannten antiliberalen Grundannahmen der islamischen Religion treffen auf jeden Gläubigen mehr oder minder stark zu. Diese Unterscheidung von Islam=Gut Islamismus=Böse hindert nur an einer grundsätzlichen Religionskritik. Zumal Islam*ismus* ja eine Fremdzuschreibung ist und sich sowieso kein Moselm selbst so bezeichnet.

Selbstverständlich muss sich die Linke gegen eine Islamkritik stellen, die vor dem Hintergrund der ""christlichen Traditionen Europas"" formuliert wird. Denn von christlichen Islamkritikern hat man kaum etwas besseres zu erwarten als vom Islam selbst. Dennoch warte ich bis heute auf eine überzeugende eigene Islamkritik die von einer linken europäischen Partei artikuliert wird.

Anche un bambino può capire che la tutela esiste solo se opera da subito, cioè, com’era una volta, dopo i primi 8/30 giorni di prova (a seconda delle qualifiche); se no è fasulla. Inoltre il padrone potrà prima assumere un lavoratore con contratto a tempo determinato; e lo può fare per tre anni; poi potrebbe passarlo a “contratto a tempo indeterminato a tutele crescenti”.

UDMR ( the main magyar party, often part of government like now and with lots of mps) relies on geting 5% of votes.

Jogaila is lithuanized version of XIX century. Before that in many international writings he was descripted as Jagiełło(even french, latin). His official name still is Jagiełło, because Jogaila is not the exact name.

What a bullshit. Those lands were part of Poland before WW2. They are not ""tutejszy"" they clearly know they are polish, not lithuanian. Russian minority in lithuania is in diaspora, while polish lives only in eastern lithuania, back then even in Kowno, almost 60% of the people spoke polish, but they were forcibly lithuanized, or expelled.

Just look at those parades in Vilnius, they are clearly polish, because they speak polish, and associate with Poland.

&gt;

&gt;The __Western Sahara__ (US ^i/ˌwɛstərn səˈhærə/; UK /ˌwɛstən səˈhɑrə/; [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language): الصحراء الغربية‎ *Aṣ-Ṣaḥrā’ al-Gharbīyah*; [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language): *Sahara Occidental*; [Berber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_language): __Taneẓroft Tutrimt__) is a [disputed territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_dispute) in the [Maghreb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghreb) region of [North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa), bordered by [Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco) to the north, [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria) to the extreme northeast, [Mauritania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania) to the east and south, and the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean) to the west. Its surface area amounts to 266,000 square kilometres (103,000 sq mi). It is one of the [most sparsely populated territories in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_population_density), mainly consisting of desert flatlands. The population is estimated at just over 500,000,  of whom nearly 40% live in [El Aaiún](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Aai%C3%BAn) (also spelled Laâyoune), the largest city in Western Sahara.

&gt;Occupied by [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain) since the late 19th century, the Western Sahara has been on the [United Nations list of non-self-governing territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_list_of_Non-Self-Governing_Territories) since 1963 after a Moroccan demand.  It is the most populous territory on that list, and by far the largest in area. In 1965, the [UN General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly) adopted its first resolution on Western Sahara, asking Spain to decolonise the territory.  One year later, a new resolution was passed by the General Assembly requesting that a referendum be held by Spain on self-determination. 

&gt;In 1975, Spain relinquished the administrative control of the territory to a joint administration by Morocco (which had formally claimed the territory since 1957)  and Mauritania.  A war erupted between those countries and the [Sahrawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahrawi_people) [national liberation movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_liberation_movement), the [Polisario Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polisario_Front), which proclaimed the [Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic) (SADR) with a [government-in-exile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government-in-exile) in [Tindouf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tindouf), Algeria. Mauritania withdrew in 1979, and Morocco eventually secured effective control of most of the territory, including all the major cities and natural resources.

&gt;Since a [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations)-sponsored ceasefire agreement in 1991, two thirds of the territory (including most of the Atlantic coast line)  has been controlled by Morocco and the remainder by the SADR, strongly backed by Algeria.  Internationally, countries such as the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) and [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) have taken a generally ambiguous and neutral position on each side's claims, and have pressed both parties to agree on a peaceful resolution. Both Morocco and Polisario have sought to boost their claims by accumulating formal recognition, essentially from African, Asian, and Latin American states in the developing world. The Polisario Front has won formal recognition for SADR from [82 states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_Western_Sahara#States_recognizing_the_Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic_as_a_sovereign_state_controlling_Western_Sahara), and was extended membership in the [African Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union). Morocco has won recognition or support for its position from several African governments and from most of the [Arab League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League).   In both instances, recognitions have, over the past two decades, been extended and withdrawn according to changing international trends. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] As of 2006 [update], no other [member state of the United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_United_Nations) has recognized Moroccan [sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty) over Western Sahara.

Since the EU would be more of a federal state/supranational organisation it satisfies (in my opinion) the requirements of regional independence. It also isn't dominated by any one country whereas whatever country would get the Capitol in a Nordic Union would be pretty heavily favoured in a lot of areas.

Oh, i myself have the BA credit card. I get enough Avios a year for two long distance upgrades from Premium Economy to Club World and am happy about that. Sometimes i convince others to let me pay for their BA credit card for a year so that i'll get 20k Avios bonus. But a business ticket on them is also 80k Avios.

It's rather weird that you weren't charged fees. All airlines do it.

Avec Sarkozy, l'économie va continuer comme d'hab, le progrès sociaux vont stagner, l'image du gouvernement dans les médias va être à gerber. Je peux continuer à vivre sans trop être embêté, juste un peu déçu ou énervé. Avec Le Pen, mes économies vont crasher, la valeur de mon salaire aussi, mon boulot va être à risque, je ne vais plus pouvoir aller travailler à l'étranger comme je veux, mes collègues et amis étrangers vont avoir du mal à rester, on aura des émeutes, on va régresser socialement au lieu de stagner (état policier, possible rétablissement de la peine de mort, suppression de l'avortement, encouragement de la femme au foyer et l'homme au travail…).

Ne serait-ce que égoïstement, je devrais voter contre Le Pen rien que pour ne pas risquer de perdre mes économies (du moins celles que je n'aurais pas pu passer à l'étranger avant). Et c'est pas comme si j'étais très riche, j'ai juste économisé depuis les 2~3 ans que je travaille histoire d'avoir un gros apport pour un appart.

On n'a pas un système de vote par Condorcet ou équivalent, donc le principe ce n'est pas de voter pour celui que tu préfère. C'est de voter pour avoir l'effet le moins indésirable.

D'ailleurs au 1er tour aussi, si il y a un risque trop gros (style PS vs FN au coude à coude derrière l'UMP, j'envisagerais de voter PS plutôt qu'un petit parti que j'aime bien; ou par exemple si UMP vs FN au coude à coude derrière le PS, je pourrais voter UMP pour essayer d'éliminer le risque du FN).

UMP et PS c'est pas vraiment différent sur ma situation. Il y a des différences d'image, d'ouverture sociale, etc… Mais par contre les extrêmes ça créé un gros risque que je veux éviter. Oui, c'est pas idéaliste, mais c'est comme ça. Ce qui compte le plus pour moi c'est le résultat, pas ma satisfaction perso d'avoir soutenu le petit parti qui n'a aucune chance. Tant pis.

true,DreamingLight,null,null,"&gt; We don't sell our users' information to anybody. We do use user information to target ads, but the way that works is that the advertiser gives us the ad and some idea of who they want to advertise to, and we show the ads to those people -- we don't feed the personal information back to the advertisers! One important thing to understand about Google's advertising philosophy is that it sort of reverses traditional advertising dogma. The old (1950's) approach was to show your ad everywhere, to get the brand hammered into everyone's head. The original Google idea about ads was to use the same sort of logic that we use for search to try to figure out which ads would be valuable to the user at that particular moment. As one of our VP's once said to me, if we're doing it right, the users should complain if the ads are missing. And this approach has made us what's technically known as ""large stacks of cash:"" it turns out that, if you show people ads at times when they might have commercial intent, or generally be receptive to them, and show them ads about things which they might personally find interesting, they're a lot more likely to actually click on them and use them. Which makes these ads convert at a much higher rate than traditional ads, which makes advertisers happier, too. And as far as our users' personal information -- not just the aggregated data that we use to serve ads, but their actual e-mails, locations, and so on -- we are extremely protective of that and don't even let it flow around internally within the company. The mere suggestion that someone could use our systems to find a way to infer a small bit of private information about someone without their consent is enough to cause people's eyes to bug out and trigger a lot of very serious, urgent discussions.  It's a bit hard to describe to the outside world just how privacy-obsessed this company actually is. ﻿

What is the practical barrier to priesthood? To be named as a priest by other priests. Yes, all churches are like that. 

&gt;The idea of Orthodox Church is that people who have devoted their entire lives to finding the truth (priests) can help others (followers) reach the truth on their own, not tell them what truth is.

that is so nice, almost as nice but it falls short in practice as neither the individual or the church teachings are primordial, the individual priest is, he has both the trust of the church and that of the ""seeker"" and I don't trust a middle age guy that can't keep a job to have live figured out. Now when talking to a buddhitst, not only is he forbiden from giving advice or giving certainty(fearing you will stroke his ego) but he also needs to entertain any relevation you may find on your own.(even if it is contrary to his own)

&gt;having the Church help followers reach the truth on their own

well that is the thing, for the church to help followers it needs to know the truth, buddhism does not claim to know anything, it is just here a tool to self discovering your own truth. That is why it isn't a church, a church is a institution that claims to have truth, that has a arbitrary definition of good or bad.

I barely know italian music made after 2000. I think the quality of italian music simply went down in the last decade even though the 90s were a good decade of experimentation, the sound of pop music couldn't keep pace with the times.

* Mina
* Ornella Vanoni
* Franco Califano
* Luigi Tenco
* Adriano Celentano
* Eugenio Finardi
* Edoardo Bennato
* Matia Bazar
* Nilla Pizzi (very old, but a classic)
* Alberto Fortis



**Jazzy**

Jazz has actually got a decent scene in Italy, and jazz or blues influenced musicians are quite good

* Vinicio Capossela
* Pino Daniele
* Paolo Conte
* Sergio Cammarere
* Sergio Caputo

**Cantautori**

Singer song writers, the bane of 70s and 80s Italian music, still hugely popular. There are exceptions, of course.

* Antonello Venditti (unbearable unless you are from Rome)
* Franceso De Gregori
* Francesco Guccini
* Flavio Giurato
* Piero Ciampi
* Fabrizio De Andrè (he's ok)
* Lucio Dalla (he's ok)
* Giorgio Gaber (he's ok)
* Cesare Cremonini

**Demenziale**

Probably one of the few non derivative genres in Italy - ""Demential rock"". It's all about the lyrics. Somewhere in between Frank Zappa and Al Yankovich.

* Enzo Jannacci
* Skiantos
* Squallor
* Elio E Le Storie Tese
* Nanowar of Steel

**Prog**

Italian prog rock is actually sought after by lovers of the genre around the world. But it's still prog rock.

* Goblin (famous for the soundtracks to Dario Argento's horro movies)
* Giganti
* PFM (Premiata Forneria Marconi)
* Area
* Stormy Six
* Banco Del Mutuo Soccorso
* Orme
* Franco Battiato
* Balletto Di Bronzo

**80s/90s rock**

Italian version of the current sounds. Productions still don't stand up to today's standards.

* Liftiba
* CCCP Fedeli Alla Linea (they were actually good)
* CSI
* Enrico Ruggeri
* Diaframma
* Negazione
* Massimo Volume
* Elisa
* Bluvertigo
* 883
* Afterhours
* Modena City Ramblers
* **EDIT** Vasco Rossi 

**80s synth pop/disco**

For once the influence wasn't america, but the German NDW

* Krisma
* Gaznevada
* Tantra
* Gino Soccio
* Alexander Robotnick


**Masochist corner**

I dare you to listen to an album by these from beginning to end. I double dare you.

* Renato Zero
* Alberto Camerini
* Pooh
* Teppisti Dei Sogni
* Patty Pravo
* Agricantus

**Contemporari pop**

Mostly influenced by US rock

* Ligabue
* Tiziano Ferri
* Subsonica
* Perturbazione
* Luca Carboni
* Luci Della Centrale Elettrica
* Daniele Silvestri
* Lunapop
* Giorgio Canali
* Joe Cassano
* Baustelle
* Clark Nova
* Desert Motel

**Alt Rock**

As you have noticed, American sounds are the main influence in Italian music.

* Verdena
* Tre Allegri Ragazzi Morti
* Non Voglio Che Clara
* Marta Sui Tubi
* Zen Circus
* Perturbazione
* Il Teatro Degli Orrori
* Prozac+
* Negrita
* Negramano
* Marlene Kuntz
* Giardini di Mirò
* 24 Grana
* a Toys Orchestra
* Bud Spencer Blues Explosion
* Calibro 35


**Rap**

Mostly they get marks out of goodwill - the quality is quite low. Caparezza stands out for me.

* Jovanotti
* Caparezza (actually decent)
* Fabri Fibra
* Frankie HI-NRG MC
* Mondo Marcio
* Articolo 31
* Assalti Frontali
* 99 Posse
* Uochi Tochi
* colle der fomento
* sangue misto
* neffa
* I cavallieri della dopa

**Reggae**

In the south they like their reggae

* Almamegretta (actually relocated to the UK, and very good - they remixed Massive Attack)
* Casino Royale
* Sud Sound System

**Heavy Metal**
As recomended in comments below

* Rhapsody of Fire
* Vision Divine
* Lacuna Coil
* Linea 77

**House/Techno**

Stopped following that music before Italians got any good at it

* Maya + Tamperer
* Black Box
* Benny Benassi

**DnB/Dubstep/IDM**

Don't know a single decent Italian act

**Soundtrack**

A lot of underground DJs love to sample old Italian soundtrack, they are plenty compilations around

* Ennio Morricone
* Armando Trovaioli
* Franco Micalizzi
* Alessandro Alessandroni
* Augusto Martelli

**Misc**

* Davide Van De Sfroos (cnw influenced folk singer)
* Adriano Canzian (experimental eletroctronic music)
* Bochum Welt (ambient)
* Aktuala (ethnic 70s rock)

Ce n'est absolument pas fait aujourd'hui. 200 000 entrées par an. On a totalement le pouvoir de renvoyer 200 000 clandestins, aujourd'hui, et d'arrêter de donner des autorisations de séjour, aujourd'hui.

&gt;J’aurai du me douter que proposer une expérience de pensée à un frontiste était largement trop optimiste

Tu as spéculé sur mon raisonnement et tu t'es lamentablement planté.

&gt;Tu as aussi dit : Le facteur le plus important dans la délinquance, ce sont les inégalités de revenus 

Classique le mec qui ne lit que la moitié des phrases...

&gt;Oh évidement, j’oubliais que pour le frontiste le fait qu’un gamin maghrébin de 12 ans qui se retrouve à faire le guet pour du trafic de shit dans une ZSP est le résultat d’une vocation ethnique et n’a rien à voir avec un phénomène d’entraînement ou de contexte.

https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman

Jamais dit ça. Contente toi de me citer. 

&gt;Inutile, tes sources suffisent ici, tu vois bien non?

Bien sûr qu'elles suffisent. Encore faut-il les lire.

&gt;Bon, j’ai bien compris ton besoin de simplifier les choses pour te sentir à l’aise. Cependant, sans nier ou minimiser la prévalence de ce problème, à nouveau ce que tu dis est faux, ou du moins plus subtil que ça. De l’ordre de 15% d'élèves ont des difficultés sévères dans une combinaison de ces domaines, de l’ordre du déchiffrement et/ou de la compréhension. Ne pas savoir lire touche une proportion de l’ordre de 3 à 4%, ce qui est déjà trop. 

Débat sémantique sans intérêt et rempli de jugements de valeur. 15% des élèves ne savent pas lire, écrire ou compter (c'est écrit mot pour mot ""15% d’élèves ne maîtrisent pas les fondamentaux de la lecture""). 40% ont des difficultés sévères.

&gt;De plus, c’est un problème complexe dont un des paramètres est le niveau à l’entrée en CP. Dans les sources que tu citais et que tu n’as pas compris ils mentionnent le caractère crucial de la condition initiale de l’élève à l’entrée dans un cycle

Sans déconner. Et donc en laissant venir des immigrés qui ne parlent pas français et sont très faiblement qualifiés ça fait mécaniquement baisser le niveau moyen.

&gt;Maintenant je comprends aussi ta tentation de mettre ce problème sur le dos des enseignants, eu égard à la haine que portent souvent les frontistes sur toute profession d’ordre intellectuelle

Comme d'hab une bassesse de quelqu'un qui ne sait plus comment s'en sortir.

&gt;Je souhaite vraiment t’aider : c’est lequel de ces mots que tu ne comprends pas ?

Je te retourne la question. Tu n'as pas l'air de comprendre que cela soutient exactement mes propos. Mais visiblement tu as du mal à comprendre ce que tu lis, je ne suis pas le seul à te l'avoir dit.

Tiens je vais être gentil je vais te mettre directement la conclusion de l'auteur :

 la mixité sociale, si
elle apparaît défavorable par rapport aux classes
favorisées, ne se révèle pas plus propice  aux apprentissages que des classes plus défavorisées. Nos
résultats invitent donc à conclure, comme le faisait
déjà Grisay en 1993 au niveau du collège, que la
mixité sociale a davantage d’effet sur l’expérience
scolaire des élèves que sur leur réussite purement
académique.

Et concernant l'expérience :

Ces résultats sont finalement convergents avec
ceux obtenus précédemment puisqu’ils indiquent que
la mixité sociale, si elle favorise une certaine confusion des normes scolaires, génère également, et sans
doute en conséquence, une expérience scolaire
connotée plus négativement.

En une phrase : expérience scolaire négative et aucun avantage scolaire. Bien joué.

&gt;C’est citer des sources et affirmer l’inverse de ce qu’elles disent comme tu le fais qui relève de l’aveuglement idéologique le plus crasse.

Non, il suffit de lire et c'est écrit noir sur blanc.

---

Le reste de ton commentaire n'a aucun intérêt. Je me permets de te corriger une dernière fois :

&gt;Pour qu’ils y crèvent ou en reviennent. 

Hahaha. Tu délires sur l'état de l'Afrique ce qui est d'ailleurs fréquent chez les pro-immigration. Non, l'Afrique n'est pas un continent où tout le monde meurt de faim... Ils ont 50/60 ans de retard en terme de développement, c'est pas grand chose et ce n'est surement pas en partant en France que ça va s'arranger.

Je te suggère de te renseigner car tout d'abord ceux qui partent font en réalité partie des personnes qui peuvent se payer le trajet donc ne sont absolument pas les pauvres qui risquent de crever de faim, d'autre part ceux qui sont en danger bénéficient déjà du droit d'asile (au passage les demandes d'asile sont rejetées à plus de 80%). 

L'immigration africaine est principalement économique : ils viennent en France tant que c'est un pays plus riche et plus libre, mais ce n'est pas parce qu'ils meurent de faim là-bas.

Viveva di pacchi di wurstel (quelli da 20 cent del discount), ketchup e maionese.

Passava il suo tempo con gli zingari rom andando a fare graffiti o con altri subumani di origine italiana. Una volta gli chiesi se si rendesse conto dell'atto vandalico e di quanto fosse deleterio. La sua risposta fu:

"" E io che mi devo sorbire la pubblicità ovunque non sono vittima del vandalismo legale? Devo vedere manifesti e cartelloni ovunque e non posso farci nulla. Io rendo la città colorata, la rendo meno grigia, combatto il sistema perché loro spendono un sacco di soldi per mettere la pubblicità e io gliela rovino e imbratto "".

Detto tra noi, i suoi graffiti facevano veramente ma veramente cagare. Credo si firmasse come pete mosh. Voleva andare in Spagna a fare gli esami di medicina perché erano più semplici. Ho meditato di stamparmi una targhette da indossare sotto i vestiti con scritto "" Se il mio medico è questa persona, non lasciatemi nelle sue mani "".

This is the thing. You mustn't respond to this question solemnly based on culture.

Because if we base our answer on culture: Canada, New Zealand and Australia are not valid answers, because they are dominantly European in culture. Thus Australia, Canada and New Zealand are European.

If we base it on geography: Canada, New Zealand and Australia are valid answers to the question. Russia is not because geographically it's European too.

It's a good idea to take geography in account for a big part, because Russia not being a valid answer makes more sense than Australia, Canada and New Zealand not being valid answers.

So we need to answer based on a mix of cultural reasons and geographical reasons. Now you want to think in 3 entities: Europe, Eurasia and Asia. But since we also need to take into account geography (Australia, Canada and New Zealand must be valid answers, so they  mustn't  be European. They're European in culture, so we make them valid answers based on geography) Those 3 entities can't exist at the same time.

So you have 3 choices:  Either you base the answer on culture: New Zealand, Australia and New Zealand are valid answers and so is Russia because culturally it's Eurasian, neither European nor Asian.

Or you base our answer on geography: New Zealand, Australia and New Zealand are not valid answers and neither is Russia because geographically it's Eurasian (and thus European as well)

Or you base it on both: New Zealand, Australia and New Zealand are valid answers, but Russia isn't. 

Eurasia , Europe and Asia can only exist at the same time if we're talking about culture (European culture is not Eurasian culture, Eurasian culture is not European culture, Asian culture isn't Eurasian culture etcetera) But if we talk about it geographically, you either call the entire thing Eurasia, or you split it into Europe and Asia and call countries that are split European and Asian a.k.a Eurasian.",0,1411223127,null,0,false,0,cknlm7r,t3_2gy01z,t1_cknlm7r,t1_cknl598,null,1426908490,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Dolcester,null,null,"&gt;Ça empêche de facto les naturalisations nouvelles. ¸

Sa veut dire quoi que ceux qui viennent de certains pays n'auront automatiquement pas le droit a la citoyenneté parce que leur pays d’origine ne reconnais pas la renonciation. Je doute très fortement que se soit légal???

Ajouté a cela que ses pays peuvent simplement voter des lois comme la Turquie, l'Afghanistan et la Somalie pour déjouer les systemes des pays qui ne permettent pas la double citoyenneté et la naturalisation.

&gt;Turkey allows dual citizenship, and former Turkish citizens who have given up their Turkish citizenship (for example, because they have naturalized in a country that usually does not permit dual citizenship, such as Germany or Austria) can apply for the ""Blue Card"" (mavi kart), which gives them some citizens' rights back, e.g. the right to live and work in Turkey, the right to possess land or the right to inherit, and the right to vote after 3 years.

Basiquement citoyen A renonce a sa citoyenneté en France et se fait naturaliser. Maroc et Turquie s'en fiche puisqu'ils ont une loi   qui lui permettre de la ravoir a l'insu de l'état francais des que son  processus de naturalisation est fini. 

 &gt;Et il est possible de renoncer à sa nationalité par décret, tout comme il faut un décret pour être naturalisé en France.

Ah oui comment as tu des sources???

Non sa ne l'est pas si tu es marocain, tunisien , libanais tu peux dire ce que tu voudras t'auras encore ta citoyenneté regarde l'exemple de  l'Allemagne et de l'Autriche.

&gt;Plus des deux tiers des immigrés du Maghreb, 55 % des immigrés de Turquie et 43% de ceux du Portugal combinent la nationalité française et celle de leur pays d'origine. La double nationalité est significativement associée avec un plus fort sentiment d'appartenance au pays d'origine.

Pourtant les statistiques montrent le contraire complètement

&gt;On observe peu d'impact de la double nationalité sur le sentiment d'être Français. Les immigrés doubles-nationaux se sentent autant Français que ceux qui ont abandonné leur ancienne nationalité (82 % dans les deux cas). Ce sentiment d'appartenance est un peu plus faible pour les descendants d'immigrés doubles-nationaux (87 %) par rapport à ceux qui n'ont que la nationalité française (94 %)

&gt;On n'a pas de stats sur la double nationalité en prison.

Alors 0 statisstiques et 0 sources et on propose une idée...


&gt; Non. Cela impliquerait qu'on arrêterait éventuellement de donner la nationalité française à certaines personnes. Vu le nombre de doubles nationaux venant de ces pays, s'ils ne sont pas contents ils pourront faire pression sur leur pays d'origine, mais ça ne regarde pas la France.

Je doute tres fortement que sa sois légale sur le plan juridique. C'est un cas flagrant d'inégalité et je doute que la cour constitutionnelle le permette ou la cour européenne. Basiquement parce que mon pays refuse de reconnaitre ma renonciation je n'ai aucun droit a la citoyenneté?? Il s'agit clairement d'une loi qui vise certaine communauté 

et d'ailleurs je me méfie encore plus du FN et de ses partisans. D'ailleurs dans la précédente discussion sur la Pologne.. beaucoup de chose semblait me troubler encore confirmer aujourd’hui .

Sa reste que la mesure ne s'appuie sur rien mais que sur du vent.


&gt;Tu essayais de montrer quoi avec ça ? Quel est le rapport avec la double nationalité ?

Que tes chiffres étaient bidons ce qui s'est avéré vrai.


&gt;Si on prend le cas de la Belgique, on voit que 3 milliards partent de France vers la Belgique alors qu'il n'y a que 113 000 Belges vivant en France... Ça fait 27 000 euros en moyenne par Belge en 2013.
Ces chiffres ne montrent rien et n'ont rien à voir avec une supposée ""générosité"" des expatriés.

Évidemment ta pris 1 donnée de la totalité pour montrer ton point ce qui est totalement déshonnête, sans compter que la Belgique a une réputation de pays a la flexibilité fiscale et qu'il y a une hausse 50% des francais qui demandait la nationalité Belge(Pays venant tout juste d’approuver la double citoyenneté dans sa constitution d'ailleurs en 2008). Mais curieux avant que la Belgique n'adopte la double citoyenneté en 2008 la contribution de ses expatriés était minime soudainement apres 2008 et ladoption de la double nationalité leurs contributions ont soudainement bondi a 3 milliards en 2012.


&gt; Les pays de l'UE ne sont pas concernés par la fin de la double nationalité. Lis le programme.

Non je ne l'ai pas lue envoie le lien avec la source précise svp. Ironique pour un parti qui veut sortir de l'UE

&gt; C'est faux en 2011, marginal en 2012 et ta conclusion tombe à l'eau.

Loin de la de 2003 a 2012 , 2011 a été la seule année(En partie causé par la crise)) tu ne peux prendre 1 année en donnée statistiques pour conclure que   que les résultats ne sont pas vrai.


&gt;La double nationalité avec un certain nombre de pays du Maghreb pose plus de difficultés d'assimilation"" qu'avec un pays comme les Etats-Unis.

Basé sur aucune source ni aucune preuve évidemment.  Certains migrants africains ont autant de problemes que ses communautés et ceux meme si ils n'ont pas de double nationalité. Sa reste a avoir le ratio criminel vs nombre de personnes dans la communauté qui ont une double nationalité (Qui je suis sur sur est absolument minime)

&gt;Qu'est-ce qui te permet de croire que les binationaux choisiront un autre pays que la France ?

La majorité d'entre eux sont des expatriés bien établi tout dépendamment du pays, la nationalité francaise sera laissé tombé.


&gt;Autour de moi, ce sont surtout des Américains qui renoncent à leur nationalité américaine... L'ambassade croule sous les demandes d'ailleurs.

Je l'ai montré plus haut ses américains sont déja établis en France ont un boulot tout comme le francais qui est a l'extérieur lâchera sa nationalité si il est bien établi ce qui est le cas de la majorité d'entre eux.




En conclusion tu ne ma rien démontré. l'interdiction de la double nationalité n'est basé sur rien de rationnelle,les sondages montrent que les immigrés sont toujours attaché a la France autant que ceux qui y ont renoncé  crée un faux débat, serait je suis pratiquement sur illégale juridiquement puisque certain français n'auront pas le droit a la naturalisation puisqu'ils viennent d'un pays A mais d'autres y auront droit puisqu'il viennent d'un pays B(Nah lol aucune chance que sa passe).

Aucune chance q'une cour  une loi ouvertement inégalitaire a se point. Une mesure qui ne s'appuie sur rien. 

Tout en sachant que la France n'a aucun controle sur les lois voté dans un pays ni a son registre de citoyen.

Bref un faux débat, une proposition d'interdiction basé sur rien.

Edit: Certaines mesures semblent si ridicules que je doute qu'il soit vraiment dans le programme du parti mais qu'il sorte tous droit de ta tête. Notamment l'interdiction a certain citoyen dont le pays ne reconnais pas la la renonciation d’être naturalisé français. Peut tu me montrer ouais ce que le FN propose cette mesure avec sources svp?

It's not taxing companies, it's taxing all of us, bottom lines will not be affected.

Big companies have more capital which makes them fundamentally more flexible to preadate on new uninformed capital, most of that money will go into coca cola, fast food and inhumane housing.

It all starts with the best product technology has to offer.

Then you sell it at a price point where you cover R&amp;D costs and some marketing.

Software designers will create products that will take advantage of new tech and in doing so boosting the demand for your products.

After a tech cycle passes, you basically use the same tech/components to make 3-4 slightly better products aldough they are mostly the same and most of the R&amp;D costs goes into design and marketing.

When a new technology comes along, you refubish the previous technology as consumer grade tech, the software is already abundant and the hype is alredy build up in the market and basically paid for.

At this stage you start making money of that tech, you finance expansion or get profits, this is when 5% growth turns into actual profits. By this time the assembly line is 5-6 years and now you finish of your payments on it. Most marketing costs are neglisable and it's done by vendors, and you pay for it in cheap phones.

After 2 cycles, you are done, the factory is wobly, the market is oversaturated by your products so you get one last edition out, usually an economy product, you go to town on this, and you usually make a killing with them in china, india or africa.

In public health care you wait 3 months up to 2 years depends on what you need. Almost every institution in this country is a nuisance, it'll be faster to say which is not. Income tax threshold is lower than in Tanzania, so 3 times minimum wage is already taxed, this makes people go for social assistance. We're spending 4 bln more for social assistance than for labor offices and business grants, government spending for R&amp;D is nonexistent. 

&gt; 88% of entrepreneurs and ceo's sees deterioration or no improvement in their businesses

There are 20+ separate institutions that can control a company. More red tape than almost every country in the EU. To get an average wage of ~3800 your employer will pay a total of 4300+ and you'll get ~2800, that is per 1 € earned by an employee, a total cost of taxes is 1.6 € - http://newdirectionfoundation.org/documents/public/attachments/TaxLiberationDays2013.pdf - page 13. That makes entrepreneurs export more than a half of their products, cause people here has no money to support national market.

None of them was so arrogant.

&gt; Poland is under construction. Literally everywhere in Poland theres infrastructure being built. It's due to EU funds (thanks!) but we are in the EU since 2004 and I haven't seen any previous government do that much. Sure it's not perfect but in contrary to everyone before it at least is.

""is under construction"" is a bad argument. Most of roads that has been built are 5 times more expensive than roads in e.g. Switzerland. Go from Cracow to Katowice and you'll pay like 30-40 zł for a section that is no longer than 70-80 kilometers. 

&gt; When GDP is growing everywhere it's ""thanks to our management, can I have a rise?"" but when crisis comes ""it's gov fault!"".

The case is that they were doing nothing to fix this situation. I wrote above about red tape. No one has enough courage to admit that we can't afford upkeeping that much of public sector. We wouldn't need so much of EU funds, or we could use them more efficiently if we wouldn't have so much taxes, cause companies that builds this infrastructure wouldn't give away so much to our glorious state.

C'è una grossa differenza fra licenziare tre persone e licenziarne 300, perché nel secondo caso si tratta di licenziamento collettivo che richiede una specifica procedura.

&gt; E per le aziende piccole come funziona?

Per le aziende piccole la possibilità di reintegro non è mai stata prevista, in caso di licenziamento illegittimo il giudice può decidere di ordinare il pagamento di un indennizzo.

&gt; Ok, quindi in pratica ti danno un tot di mesi di stipendio dopo il licenziamento?

Ti danno un pagamento, ordinariamente in soluzione unica, pari a 12-&gt;24 mensilità.

&gt; Perche' si dice che e' difficile licenziare

Perché la burocrazia relativa è abbastanza opprimente e, pre-riforma Fornero, il rischio di contenzioso relativamente alto. La situazione è anche più difficile in caso di licenziamenti collettivi, che richiedono una procedura di durata fino a 7+45+30 giorni e la consultazione obbligatoria dei sindacati.

&gt; e perche' non danno contratti a tempo indeterminato

Non c'è un caso tipico: ci sono aziende il cui esiste un alto turnover fisiologico e il contratto a t.d. è la soluzione legalmente più comoda, ci sono aziende che hanno un flusso di lavoro altamente variabile e quindi il contratto a t.d. è una necessità organizzativa, ci sono aziende che vivono dello sfruttamento quasi-schiavile della propria forza lavoro e usano i contratti a t.d. per imporre condizioni miserevoli a una forza lavoro senza alternative (perché se non gli va bene qualcosa non c'è neanche bisogno di licenziarli, basta non rinnovare il contratto al prossimo giro).

Sounds like credit cards suck in Germany. In the US for instance you can get a card like the Chase Freedom - No annual or monthly fees, 5% cash back on rotating categories (like Amazon or department stores) and 1% cash back on everything. Or a Capital One card that gives you 2% back on everything. Pretty good deals actually, PROVIDED YOU PAY THEM ON TIME. 

I do like carrying around cash in Germany.. especially those coins. It's pretty fun to go up to the bar and trade a few gold coins for a beer! I feel like a pirate, haha.

&gt;As for encouraging consumerism, I'd say that it only happens if you are buying things that you don't need. If I see a sale, I'll react the same way if I have to pay in cash or card. If you have self control and not buy things that you don't need, you can gain a lot of purchasing power via credit cards.

True. A lot of people are stupid and this way they'll be easily taken advantage of, but then again, that is their problem.

&gt;That and the fact that it builds your credit history, which will potentially save you thousands when you get a better interest rate on your home or car loan. 

In the ex-Yu we try to avoid loans any way we can. If you owe someone something, you're not free until you pay it back. I dislike loans more than anything (at least finance-related), so I don't see much benefit from using credit cards when it comes to credit ratings, but I see how you, or anyone from the West, especially US, would benefit from it.

However, banks have a lot of influence on politics. They also have an incentive for you to take up their loans. You're most likely to take up loans if you can't earn enough to accomplish anything without them. When you combine all these, it could (and most likely does) lead to banks excreting their influence on politics in a way that maintains status quo in which people are dependent on their ability to take up loans. This can hugely limit your freedoms — you don't earn as much as your labor and time are worth, and you have to spend more for the products that are worth less then their price would be in a truly competitive market.

That's why I attempt to have as little to do with banks as possible. The more you're in contact with them, the more you support them, since banks aren't altruistic — they always profit from that contact. By using credit cards, I'm supporting them.

I know, but you're still paying your own flight. Credit card companies *force* higher prices, as merchant cannot display the difference in price between goods without the fee and with it. You're essentially raising the prices of all products throughout the whole country, while disallowing any competition.

AND I KNOW your behaviour (reclaiming the fees you paid) is the most sensible thing to do, but it entirely depends on the anti-competitive practices by credit card companies. IF a cheaper payment system would arise, it has no change of surviving. It would either have to be vastly superior (which is unlikely) in order for consumers to start asking merchants to accept it. OR consumers could benefit by all merchants deciding to adopt the new system, cutting ties with existing industries and offering lower prices. 

Both solutions are unlikely for different reasons, but the bottom line is: you're paying your credit card companies a lot of money while simultaneously praising them for giving part of it back. 

Again, I'm not attacking your behaviour. It's the most sensible thing to do for an individual in the face of market failure. However, all-in-all it's a stupid system and should have been outperformed by competitors a long time ago.

States are sovereign. Such nitpicking about assets just isn't done, at least not after WWII. If you want to sanction Cuba for something, do it for existing human rights abuses.

Nah, they won't bother with that. Their mindset is that the referendum is illegal and so people will not be allowed to vote, whatever it takes (they threatened to dissolve the catalan government and all of our autonomy laws), also they'll push for boycott and try to convince people not to vote.

Yes, I think that Spain has historically always (and this goes back centuries) milked us for money, which we could use to live better. We are the community with more debt and the one that gives more money away to others anyway. In fact, we are the region in the world that (proportionally to population) gives more money, 15000M€ in 2011 from our taxes that were never reinvested in Catalonia, for example. 

Though it's not only about money, they are also threatening our culture and education, limiting the amount of hours that we can teach in catalan  for example.

The competition between the card companies in the US is fierce, so they are forced to provide such good deals. If you do your homework and choose the right card you can get a very nice deal with no annual fee. And why not? The only businesses that can charge more for using credit cards are some gas stations where paying cash will save you some money. Otherwise, it definitely pays for me to use the card, and it's convenient too. Instead of getting cash for something that costs $10.04, for example, I can pay with the card and have nothing else in my pocket. What is the downside?

true,Draakon0,null,null,"Yeah, except that's not really true if submissions are restricted with very strict guidelines for approval. Besides, that does not make sense, because the more people you have, the more people will actually post content and actively take part in discussions.

One thing I have observed over many content discussion/sharing platforms is that the quality of the place is somewhat propositional to moderators (as well as other content creators, more on that later). As the caretakers of the house, they are the janitors of the place and thus can put up rules and guidelines for content that gets shared. If these rules and guidelines are bad (or not enforced) quality, then of course you will have shit posts. High quality (and enforcement of it) will make people want to post more content, not how many you have there. Lower number of people just means you get less content daily compared to high numbers. Trying to control the number of people for quality of content is a bad reason. You are just not capable of doing your job IMO.

Content creators also have a certain influence on the content as well as the community. For example, some Youtubers I have been subscribed to have quite a few subscribers already. Normally, at that point the youtube comment section would be a complete garbage. Not always though, because the attitude of the Youtuber is reflected upon the youtube comments section too. If you have a youtuber that's racist, arsehole, sexist or just generally has any bad quality, people with matching quality will just flock to him. Sure, there are even bad apples here and there with good youtubers, but not as many as with the bad ones.

IMO, the stigma around the rule that /r/polandball should be stopped. You can't control influx of people coming to your sub regardless of what you will do. Well, unless you turn the whole place into invite only. But as /r/polandball is not that, the moderators of that subreddit should actually concentrate on doing what all moderators of any content sharing platform do: Enforce the rules and guidelines set for content, on the content, not the people.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I think *ostensibly* Americans and Canadians are very similar, but then Germans, Brits, Francs, Spaniards, and Poles are all *ostensibly* very different, but polling has actually indicated that culturally our attitudes towards things are quite similar. I think it's the same situation with Canada and America, where a lot of the superficial stuff is similar, but underneath you're both quite different. The elephant in the room is healthcare. From what I understand, 'Obamacare' is seen as extremely controversial, is facing legal challenges and doesn't even come close to the kind of stuff that most European countries and Canada have. In the EU and Canada Obamacare would be seen as an *addition* to whatever social legislation is already in place, rather than a centre piece. 

This is because Canada follows the form of liberalism (NB: pretty much all members of the Western World follow *some* form of liberalism) that most European states follow, which is 'progressive' or 'social liberalism' which attempts to enhance individuals' freedom by ensuring that all people have access to education and are never forced into anything *by economic forces*. In America, they tends to follow the 'laissez faires', 'classical liberal' model whereby most forms of government intervention are seen as restrictions on individual liberty (e.g. taxation).

And this is furthered in other areas which have less to do with Canada's social liberalism, such as foreign military interventions (Notably refusing to participate in Iraq in 2003, similar to most Europeans excluding the UK) and foreign policy (Canada having full relations with Cuba, despite strong American resistance). Canada is also members of several organisations which help maintain and develop links with her European allies, notably La Francophonie and the Commonwealth. Canada even helps fund a small portion of the European Space Agency's budget.

So, despite both America and Canada being stereotyped as large, and geographically diverse countries which enjoy hunting, shooting, watching a game of hockey or 'football' and eating some deliciously greasy foods, there's more fundamental and underlying differences which (I think) are the ones that actually matter and it's these differences between the USA and Canada which don't exist between Canada and the EU, or at least in far smaller quantities. That's why Canada would make a good addition to the European Union, but the USA would not.

Ich. Aus dem simplen Grund, dass es hier nicht wie angegeben um die Sicherheit geht, sondern einzig und allein um die Einnahmen.

&gt; Man fährt auf die Messehallen zu, fährt dabei über eine lange Brücke an deren Fuße das Ortsschild steht. Dadurch das die Brücke zweispurige Bundestraße ist werden natürlich hohe Geschwindigkeiten gefahren 

Und natürlich immer an den selben (den Einheimischen bekannten) Orten.

Ganz ehrlich: bis 20kmh zu schnell sehe ich ein Ticket als Geschwindigkeitszuschlag/Steuer.

true,falconberger,CZEC,Czechistan!,"Great, I have a question, hope you answer!

Most people mix two things when talking about BI – the structure of income redistribution and the magnitude of income redistribution. BI is a different structure of income redistribution, the magnitude is a parameter of the BI model.

But most BI supporters actually seem to want a higher amount of income redistribution, they want to ensure certain level of life quality for everyone, including people who don't work. But that's not what BI is about! You could achieve the same by just changing the parameters of the current model (actually, the current model does that to a certain extent).

So BI is a change to how money is redistributed in society – it would lead to some people becoming poorer and other people becoming equally richer. I'm quite sceptical about BI because I haven't seen any analysis that would answer the question who exactly would get richer / poorer and how much. Unemployed people get money from the government today – will they get more or less after implementation of BI? What about teachers, software developers, bus drivers, lawyers, etc?

AFAIK, the main benefits of BI are supposed to be:

- The system would be simpler and cheaper. Yes, simpler, but only negligably cheaper.
- It removes disincentives to work. I'm not convinced about this, you could argue the opposite is true actually.",0,1411236032,null,0,1411239009,0,cknqeaf,t3_2gvq7d,t1_cknqeaf,t3_2gvq7d,null,1426906190,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,cyborg_selkie,EART,"US citizen, lives in Romania, married into Englishness","I used to live near Hong Kong and went there a lot. Hong Kongers are pretty cool with white people from first world countries, but that's about it - and a lot of that comes from the fact that most white first world people work in international schools and finance and stick to their own expat circles. The majority of white first world people in HK aren't assimilated, don't speak the language, etc. I'd say most western Europeans (Britons, anyway) are much more tolerant of people who are black, brown, or southeast asian, as long as they make an effort to go with the flow, whereas overt racism based on appearances isn't particularly taboo in HK (or east Asia generally, in my experience). 

In practice, Hong Kong is only open to permanent immigration from qualified (read: white collar) workers and their family. The court actually went against HK's constitution when it decided that domestic helpers (mostly Filipino or Indonesian) don't have the right to permanent residency after x number of years, unlike people who work in any other industry for the same number of years, the rationale basically coming down to ""we don't want *those* people living here"". They have a pretty poor record of allowing legitimate asylum seekers to stay. If an immigrant can't afford to put their child in an international school, the education system does a poor job at helping immigrants assimilate into mainstream schools, or society in general. 

HK is one of my favorite 'cities' and I have many good experience with Hong Kongers, but the city state's openness to immigration is more limited than you'd think, and a bit...uncomfortable.

Woah woah woah, hold on a minute. Norway was a separate kingdom throughout the entire Union with Sweden. As it was during nearly the entire period under Denmark, except for a decade or two where Norway was officially just a province in Denmark. 

This is not the sort of thing to get wrong for a quarter-Norwegian. Otherwise an enjoyable read, though, so we'll allow this one mistake. 

He's also sort of presenting the ""Norway only became wealthy with the oil"" myth, but then he's just comparing us to the other Scandinavian nations, so I guess that's okay.

Edit: This is also a somewhat strange thing to say, but now I'm sort of looking for mistakes. It's still a solid B for the effort.

Wie kann man eigentlich? Es ist nun wirklich keine Meisterleistung

&gt;Alleine die Prämisse zu deiner Verknüpfung -die Existenz eines Motivs der BRD zur Unterstützung der radikal-islamistischen Terroristen- nach dem eigenen Prinzip ""Cui Bono"" betrachtet, kann verworfen werden. 

Weil du das sagst? Oder weil du zu dumm bist die Recherche echter Journalisten, Hersh, Greenwald, etc zu lesen?

Nochmal für die Dummen von Anfang an: Die USA hatten ein Interesse daran Assad los zu werden, deren Proxies(ISIS, Al Nusra, Al Quaeda etc. zusammengefasst FSA) sollten die Drecksarbeit erledigen. 

Natopartner Türkei ließ alle europäischen Jihadtouristen frei durch, obwohl klar war was die vorhatten, versorgte Verwundete Terroristen, ließ ganze Nachschubkonvois durch. Ohne Zustimmung Washingtons? Natürlich nicht, Hersh lesen!

Dementsprechend auch hier in der BRD. Alle einfach da hinreisen lassen, schließlichen brauchen die dort ja auch Nachschub an Menschenmaterial.

Also, Cui Bono? Genau, den Interessen der USA, insbesondere Assad loszuwerden. Kommt man selbst drauf wenn man nicht nur die Propagandaorgane sondern unabhängige Presse liest.

Der Rest ist wieder wilde Verschwörungstheorie, als ob die deutsche Regierung so etwas wie ein Eigeninteresse an irgendwas hätte, ja klar. Die führen Naziterror gegen ihr eigenes Volk, mittlerweile kommt ja selbst der Staatsanwalt im NSU Prozess in Erklärungsnot wenn er wieder mal versucht eine staatliche Beteiligung abzustreiten. 

Dann handelt man in der Ukraine noch strikt gegen die eigenen Interessen, bei TTIP, in Libyen, sendet Waffen an Terroristen, einfach überall. Man muss schon geistig umnachtet sein, wenn man der Bundesregierung unterstellt sie handle im eigenen Interesse, also dem des deutschen Volkes.

Und wo du ja glaubst so glänzend Schlüsse ziehen zu können, wo sitzen denn die Profiteure?

Mach das mal als Übung. Jede Krise, jeder Krieg kennt Profiteure. Wenn du hier also schon Cui Bono schreist, dann denk das auch zu Ende. ",0,1411236934,null,0,false,0,cknqs2l,t3_2gy9kq,t1_cknqs2l,t1_cknpnsa,null,1426906012,-1,false,de,t5_22i0,-1

true,syksy,,,"Advice to those planning their visits for tomorrow: *don’t* go to the Élysée¹. I went today, I arrived at around 8:30 a.m., and I waited about 9 hours (nine!) before the security check, and then there was also a line in the garden before you could enter the building (25 minutes for me, but it got longer while I was inside). All that for about 45 minutes for the visit, but I have to admit I speeded it up a little because I was hungry and tired and I wanted to go to the bathroom. I thought it was not worth it honestly, I don’t know much about the buildings from the same period in Paris but I’m sure there are plenty that are just as beautiful and don’t require you to wait all day.

When I arrived I was reasonably far from the end of the line delimited by barriers set up by police, and they lengthened it some more during the morning, so I thought it was reasonable to expect I would get in well before the evening. In reality, the police closed the line at 12:30 p.m. I believe, and since the visit of the Élysée Palace ended at 7:00 p.m., they stopped admitting people in at around 18:30-18:40 p.m. (I heard a guard saying it to a colleague), so I’m sure some people waited all afternoon (or even more) to be told they should come back another time.
