Il suo settore ""consumer"" è ormai ridotto ad una schifezza, produce più modelli per il mercato dell'america del sud ed est europeo, che per il nostro.

L'unico pregio di fiat al momento è che il mercato dell'usato in italia va veramente bene, si trovano auto quasi nuove ad un prezzo ridotto anche del 60% rispetto a quello di listino di soli 3 anni prima.

I suggest you read up on the [crap that is sent to female politicians](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/09/women-politics-female-politicians-rape-threats-patronising-comments) for example. This is an old and still ongoing phenomenon.

Look up how female news anchors are bombarded with criticism of their clothes, hair, weight, while their male counterparts can wear the same crappy suit for a year and never get mentioned.

Why do you care who criticises them? Does the gender of the person suddenly make a difference in terms of right and wrong? Because that's pretty much the definition of sexism.

It's very easy, practically automatic, to scroll past text that doesn't interest us: just move your finger on the scrolling wheel a little bit faster. That's what almost everybody does already on reddit in order to omit the children comments of a parent discussion they don't find interesting, and jump to the next comment on a particular hierarchic level.

&gt; Different language used for no reason other than grow national e-penis break it.

This assertion is false. As I've already mentioned, the purpose of multilingual comments is not nationalistic, but to add a value for those who want to benefit from it.

&gt; And so is the Reddit: pragmatic.

Reddit is everything. You can ask pragmatic questions in order to get information, and you can just browse it in order to get a feel of other people's opinions on matters. Also, notice that I explained that having a pragmatic purpose when asking questions was a reason why I *didn't bother* to make the effort (just like I am not bothering now as I am talking to you, who have already stated you don't like it).

&gt; you force me to filter out useless text, which makes reading more tiresome

No, I do the filtering myself by making the separations clear. The difference is literally the gesture you have to make with your finger for scrolling more or less (it isn't even long enough to require more than one gesture).

&gt; Yes, ad banners are also possible to ""ignore"", but they are still annoying. Do you seriously want to be as annoying as ad banners?

I actually don't mind banners that don't try to stand out or block my browsing. If those banners also provided a benefit for a significant portion of the site's userbase (even if not the majority, or myself), then excellent! and I do believe that several people (specially in a sub dedicated in part to different European cultures) like to have the chance to see a text written in different languages.",0,1416076104,null,0,false,0,cm3dnye,t3_2mdl0w,t1_cm3dnye,t1_cm3cuv4,null,1426011153,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

While there is still a significant group of people who think like this in Poland, they are still being ridiculed every time this kind of shit shows up. No sane person would believe that it's better to live in catholic Poland, than in secular Sweden. Homosexuality and religion really isn't that important of an issue and are always brought up in order to reach the people that don't know about anything else. It's not that important from the perspective of a straight person obviously.

And what is the only really important thing in life? It's happiness. And when is your average person happy? When he can afford everything he wants and doesn't have to work himself to death in order to do so. So, once the people get richer and better educated, they will understand that some men like girls, some men like men, and it's not like some of those want to be different, but because they're born this way. And the gay/straight ratio is probably the same in every country - liberal Sweden, kinda backward Poland or Iraq. 

Well, I don't even know what's my point. :D It's not like an average redditor needs to be convinced about these things.

Anyway, peace &amp; love and don't waste your lives on spilling bullshit over the Internet!

Some are playing the victim and exploiting this quite clearly, like not going to the law with so called ""harassment"" (yes, some has been faked) and just asking for Patreon money instead of y'know, donating it to charity or another organization like others have been doing in the same circumstances. Those who have harassed people are a very fringe minority who have been outed as trolls or are ignored. It would be like if people thought the Westboro Baptist Church represented all of Christianity, while it is an extremely, extremely, small portion of people. But it is not by any means a harassment movement, especially when it features people of all walks of life, including yes,*gasp*, women. It's like people aren't bothering to do proper research anymore.

That said, there are women who experience sexism and harassment, and that is a really shitty thing. Though you see, many of the people who get outraged over this man's shirt - the so-called ""Social Justice Warriors"" - think the tiniest shit is a personal offense and blatant sexism. This man wanted nothing more than to celebrate his achievements and is now being verbal abused and slandered in media and the internet.

That's what almost everybody does already on reddit in order to omit the children comments of a parent discussion they don't find interesting, and jump to the next comment on a particular hierarchic level.  

No, that's not how that works. Because brain has to switch between languages. You look at text and your brain is confused. It's slows down the progress immensely. It's like any kind of visual spam, ads, banners, etc. It is simply annoying. Yes of course I can swipe down, but as I said so you can do with ads or annoying pictures. Doesn't mean they should stay.  

&gt; This assertion is false. As I've already mentioned, the purpose of multilingual comments is not nationalistic, but to add a value for those who want to benefit from it.  

Jesus christ there are like dozens of websites for learning a language. And same amount of apps. Why don't you go there to learn language? Also you seriously think you will learn anything by reading random translations from random comments in random languages? This is bullshit.  

&gt; Reddit is everything.  

No, you don't understand what I have written. Reddit was built on transparent interface, it is it's trademark. By adding useless lines of text you are basically destroying that transparency. There is a reason it is made this way: people like that. That's why they left Digg which had dozens of stupid flashy things. And you are doing just that, adding another flashy thing that serves no purpose. No purpose. Zero. Null. You won't learn language. And if you want to do that there are dozens of ways that don't annoy other people. Period.  

&gt; No, I do the filtering myself by making the separations clear.  

No, for the fuck sake, it is not clear when suddenly there are two versions of text and I have to focus myself to distinguish which is which. Yes it takes fraction of a second, but if one has to do that for thousand of comments it's hard to focus.  

&gt; I actually don't mind banners that don't try to stand out or block my browsing.  

Great. Except your foreign language text actually takes place of something and stands out because brain focuses on ""new"" and ""out of place"" things. Automatically.  

&gt; I do believe that several people (specially in a sub dedicated in part to different European cultures) like to have the chance to see a text written in different languages.

Cuccette minuscole: 6 brandine, 3 per lato, io su quella piú in alto, ogni volta che mi giravo sbattevo ginocchia e gomiti e partivano le bestemmie, un caldo bestiale, un inferno. Al ritorno andó meglio, feci il carico di assenzio, 6 bottiglie da 75 cl e passa la paura! La nostra cuccetta e due dei prof accompagnatori abbiamo riso per 26 ore, per fortuna riuscii a salvare 2 bottiglie come regalo per papá.

L'unica parte divertente é stata quando uno dei ragazzi di una delle altre quinte (Cicco), disperato anche lui perché non riusciva a prender sonno, inizia a vagare tormentato nella notte e finisce in prima classe: vuota, BINGO! non fidandoci della situazione rifiutiamo l'invito e ce ne stiamo buoni nell'inferno. La mattina dopo Cicco non si trova!La vicepreside che quasi sviene, vuole tagliarsi le vene, buttarsi dal treno e disperata non riesce a contattare l'alunno scomparso perché il Cicco ha lasciato valigia, cellulare, portafoglio e giubetto nella cuccetta. FFW arrivati in hotel, troviamo Cicco in jeans e maglietta a maniche corte (nevicava fuori) che ci attende con un sorriso da ebete. A quanto pare il vagone della prima classe era stato staccato a Vienna, il Cicco, senza telefono, soldi, biglietto e giacca, eterno rimandato in inglese, solo in mezzo alla neve austriaca é riuscito a prendere un'altro treno per Praga e ad arrivare in hotel prima del resto della comitiva.

The reason why only sexual minorities are mentioned in the name is because the movement is built on the premise the minority in question is in a lower position in society (in the case of LGBT rights, that these individuals are not treated as well as heterosexual people). Therefore, a movement is created to bring that specific group of people on par with the rest. 

This is also the reason why the term ""feminism"" is used is because the feminist movement is based on the premise that women are not on equal terms to men, so a movement that specifically promotes the rights of women is needed to make women equal to men.

Famiglia e matrimonio sono concetti che con la religione hanno solo marginalmente a che fare.

&gt; La donna è perfettamente in grado di mantenersi da sola, e non servono più tanti figli da far lavorare nei campi.

Ed entrambe le cose sono solo marginalmente legate alla questione del matrimonio.

&gt; Il matrimonio è un costrutto sociale inventato per sostituire quello che una volta erano le tribu

Non direi, visto che esisteva anche all'interno delle tribú, ai tempi.

&gt; e tenere il popolo organizzato e in ordine.

Il matrimonio ha avuto tante di quelle forme in tempi e luoghi differenti che attribuirgli un significato specifico in termini di controllo della popolazione è, al piú, limitante, al meno, risibile.

One way feminism differs from the LGBT rights movement is that improving men's rights can positively affect women's rights. For instance, giving men better custody rights and giving men maternity leave improves female access to the workplace, which happens to be something feminists want. I can't think of any case where improving heterosexual rights helps sexual minorities, though.

At least in my multilingual comments, there is an explicit separation (an horizontal line) between languages. Even in multilingual comments when that separation is slightly less obvious, it doesn't take my brain any more effort to ignore the text than it takes to ignore the lines with the next user's name and metadata.

&gt; Reddit was built on transparent interface, it is it's trademark. By adding useless lines of text you are basically destroying that transparency.

Those lines of text are useless to you. They are useful to other people. Just like any given comment is useless to some people, so they just scroll through and ignore it.

&gt; No, for the fuck sake, it is not clear when suddenly there are two versions of text and I have to focus myself to distinguish which is which.

It's effortless for me and many others to automatically recognise if a text is written in a language we understand. Multilingual comments usually have clear separations so, if a user is interested, they know where to jump.

&gt; Great. Except your foreign language text actually takes place of something and stands out because brain focuses on ""new"" and ""out of place"" things. Automatically.

Everything takes space, and every comment in reddit, by being clearly separated and with a different indentation than surrounding comments, has a similar effect. Just like a comment can be interesting to someone or not, so can multilingual translations.

&gt; Here you go: https://translate.google.com/ TL;DR Stop trolling and stop spamming.

You are clearly missing the point. Multilingual comments intend to add an optional value that doesn't require the reader to go out of their way (besides being much more useful than the flawed translation Google could do).

I'm neither trolling nor spamming. We are clearly never going to agree on this, so I think it's pointless to continue this conversation any further. You keep on discouraging this practice if you feel like it, and I will keep encouraging it; other people can join or not, or react to it however they want.

That being said, once I had the visa appointment, the French consulate in Chicago processed everything very quickly (like a week...pretty sure Campus France's job is to smooth out all the problems in advance). All in all it was about a solid 3 month process, and a visa appointment won't do anything until you have all your paperwork/Campus France stuff in order. My best advice is to keep in close contact with Campus France, pay the fees if you haven't already, and let them know your timeline. As far as the visa appointment, not sure how to handle that, NY is probably a lot busier than Chicago was. Good luck though, that'd be awesome if it worked out. What city are you moving to?

Je te suggère d'ailleurs [cette étude](http://www.alliancevita.org/2012/06/letude-de-mark-regnerus-us-sur-les-enfants-ayant-eu-un-parent-homosexuel/)

Extraits :

*Les résultats les plus positifs concernent les adultes provenant de familles « traditionnelles » qui se disent plus heureux, sont en meilleure santé mentale et physique et consomment moins de drogues que les autres.*

*A l’inverse, les enfants élevés par des lesbiennes sont les plus mal lotis avec une augmentation statistique inquiétante des dépressions dans leur groupe.* **Les adultes  interrogés disent également avoir été plus souvent victimes d’abus sexuels (23% contre 2% chez les enfants issus de couples hétérosexuels mariés) et souffrent plus de précarité économique (69% dépendent de prestations sociales pour 17% de ceux élevés par leurs père et mère).**

Par ailleurs, les sciences sociales ont montré les dégâts des divorces et séparations sur les enfants et les parents. Du coup avec cet argument on interdit le divorce ?

[MUPUS (MUlti PUrpose Sensor)](http://www.dlr.de/pf/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-174/319_read-18906/) is one of the instruments on board Philae measuring thermal and physical properties of the comet surface. For measurements MUPUS has sensors in both of the anchoring harpoons, the PEN penetrator, and infrared sensor TM (Thermal Mapper) for surface-temperature measurements.

[MUPUS on Philae @Philae_MUPUS](https://twitter.com/Philae_MUPUS)  
Tweets edited to a more readable form:
&gt; First off: some reported MUPUS results as found in media are wrong. They never asked us.  
&gt;
MUPUS TM worked fine throughout the whole timeline and sees a very cold steep wall in front of us TM sees clear diurnal temperature signal. Around local noon direct sunlight on that wall caused a steep temperature increase and also steep temperature drop shortly after. Data indicate low thermal diffusivity and fluffy substance.
&gt;
The anchors still below Philae in shadow see the diurnal heat wave as well and at the same time as TM and the solar panels.
&gt;
Addressing the questions about that fluffy stuff: have to speculate. Best guess tiny mineral grains and organics fluffy like cigar ash.
&gt; 
Penetrator was deployed to the commanded distance. Remember that device had not been switched on since 2002. Temperature inside PEN dropped significantly compared to status before deployment. Might have hit a pile of stuff on the way out. Another instrument saw better performance thereafter - we might have changed Philae's attitude.
&gt;
Hammering started as intended in the lowest of 3 power settings (expecting a fluffy soft surface). The depth sensor shows some up and down but no progress. The control loop increased to power setting 2. Depth sensor still shows no progress. Control loop goes to power setting 3. Still no progress!
&gt;
This means that the stuff is really hard! A very interesting finding, not visible from orbit!
&gt;
We have a secret power setting 4. Nicknamed ""desperate mode"". Beyond the design specs. We activated it.
&gt;
About the 'desperate mode' The truly genius designer of the hammer, Jerzy Grygorczuk, always said ""be careful with power mode 4."" And still no progress. The hammer gave up and failed after 7 minutes. Jerzy was right. We were desperate, activated, were punished.
&gt;
Surface must be &gt;2 MPa hard! The comet remains surprising bizarre and uncooperative. To put this into perspective: MUPUS performed beautifully inside the specifications. The comet failed to cooperate.

You are getting downvoted but that's actually  something I read on a feminist blog. They argued that math and science are inherently sexist because they were essentially ""invented"" by (white) males and the whole peer review system is a facade as male scientists can not be real peers to female scientists. 

There's similar shit with the San Francisco cesspool surrounding Ruby &amp; other hip webdev communities. Those people argue that programming is sexist because it is meritocratic and meritocracies are bad because a system where reputation is based on actual merit is not inclusive as it excludes the people without skill (no shit!).

*Children raised by same-sex couples are one of the most difficult populations in the United States to study systematically because of their small numbers and their geographic dispersion. Census data are far from ideal, and better data would, of course, be welcome. However, currently, the U.S. census is the only nationally representative data set with a large enough sample of children raised by same-sex couples to allow for statistically powerful comparisons with children of other family types.*

**The prior literature has found no evidence that children raised by same-sex couples suffer any important disadvantages (Chan, Raboy, and Patterson 1998; Patterson 1995; Stacey and Biblarz 2001; Wald 2006), yet this same literature has been heavily criticized on the methodological grounds that universally small sample sizes prevent the studies from having the statistical power to identify differences that might actually exist (Alvaré 2005; Lerner and Nagai 2001; Nock 2001). The analysis in this article, the first to use large-sample nationally representative data, shows that children raised by same-sex couples have no fundamental deficits in making normal progress through school. The core finding here offers a measure of validation for the prior, and much-debated, small-sample studies.**

Ma cosa avremo mai detto!?

Abbiamo detto che l'immagine vera, nuda e cruda, della cometa 67P, rovina *l'icona* della cometa. Quell'immagine misteriosa e affascinante che questi corpi celesti, da sempre, hanno per la gente 

Nulla é stato tolto alla particolartiá della missione, nulla al ruolo importante all'industra e della ricerca italiane

Massú, ma dai! Questo é un paese in cui si possono fare critiche e ironizzare su tutto, e perché mai invece sulla cometa no!?

Se mettere in dubbio, sorridendo, i dogmi della scienza diventa un'eresia, eh, allora, non é in questo TG che qualcosa non va.

Per fortuna ci sono scienziati che sanno sorridere, e ci scherzano sopra! Sentite cosa ha dichiarato l'ingeniere aerospaziale Amalia Ercoli Finzi, uno de padri della missione Rosetta:

Inoltre, quella delle femministe non è stata una semplice opinione del tipo ""eh la camicia fa cacare"".

Ma è stata più del tipo: ""quella camicia è sessista, è simbolo dell'oppressione patriarcale"" e minghiate varie che solo loro sanno.

I capi del ragazzo, per motivi di immagine, gli hanno detto di fare pubblica ammenda.

Non è una semplice espressione di un'opinione, ma una manipolazione che fa leva sui sensi di colpa (""sessista"" is the new ""peccatore""), un ricatto morale da manuale di abuso psicologico.

È ovvio, chiaro, palese, evidente e lapalissiano che non è neanche lontanamente paragonabile a ciò che ha passato la ragazza dell'altro thread, e ripeto per la quarta volta che non sto paragonando gli eventi scatenanti in nessun modo, neanche da lontano e neanche per sogno.

Quello delle femministe resta tuttavia un tentativo riuscito di manipolazione. Solo psicologico, ma sempre abuso è.

Yes, yes, and yes. The Revolution is viewed as one of the most positive event in modern french history. It basically shaped France as we know it today (or it's supposed to have do so). Either *everything* we did since is plain wrong, or it must have some pretty positive aspects. So that's what school tells us : The Revolution ? Good thing we did it. 

We often focus on things like democracy, religion, and equality. Democracy in France ? Gotta thanks the Revolution. A modern non religious state ? The Revolution again. People being considered all equals and no one having birth privileges. Re-vo-lution. Of course, things were more complex than that. But many things percieved as good today are credited to the french Revolution.

One thing to remember is that french Revolution lasted more than 10 years. With many, many, many different phases. Robespierre's terror wasn't great, but it was only a moment in a 10 year process. Also *what* you choose to remember and value depends on your policital views. Nearly everybody in France is fine with the Revolution as a whole, but what you consider significant in that period depends on the political side you're on.

EDIT: As /u/Pilipili noted, schools aren't engaging in any sort of hardcore propaganda. Revolution is taught, every bit of it. Still, you have to consider that the Revolution's legacy was a hot political subject for about 100 years.

Best day ever. There was a (XIXth century ugly) castle in the town I then inhabited and the town organized in its park a big spectacle with all the inhabitants and kids, it was really wonderful with cheap-ass colourful costumes sewn by the families, music, lights and so on. It's a fantastic memory for a kid! 

As for monarchists, I wouldn't know since I've never seen them really (or more probably they don't say it out loud). One of my friends went to a very conservative and catholic high school and says he met real monarchist caricatures there. 

I think that there are very few royalists in France, monarchy has been tried and tried again (several times after the Revolution even) and it did not work well and it does not appear as a solution, even in a political crisis. Writing a new version of the Constitution and beginning a new version of the republic seems more credible for example. 

Thus, people who are monarchists tend not to say it in public because they feel they would be ridiculed, and the ones who claim it in public are usually the most extreme ones and they tend to be stereotypic in more than one way... so they don't help the (non-stereotypic) others in being okay with discussing it in public.

false,TranshumansFTW,null,null,"I feel your pain, friend. Iceland and Australia are both on the receiving end of some ridiculous governmental abuses of power, illegal actions and stupidity to the extreme. Our Prime Minister is trying to Americanise our health care system, and whilst most people are focusing exclusively on the $7 GP fee there are other, more sinister things. There are plans to increase the fee over time, and to implement much higher fees to access things like MRIs and X-Rays in order to ""deter those who don't need it"". They're discriminating massively against the disabled and the poorest in society, and have offered tax breaks to those who have private health insurance (even bigger than the ones already offered...).

Members of parliament are being revealed to be massively xenophobia, proposing laws that are not only illegal under the constitution but are frankly just insane. One specific senator, Jacqui Lambie, has mentioned several times that she hates Islam and is actively trying to ban burqas and niqabs in all of Australia. When asked what they were actually *for*, all she could reply is ""it's something to do with terrorism, I know that"". She's possibly the biggest fucking idiot this country has ever elected into government - at the very least, Abbott (our PM) knows how to talk and think at the same time. She seems to do one or the other, and never both.

The government are steadily stripping away our rights to privacy and freedom of speech, allowing the Australian spy agency ASIO to act above the law in almost everything. They now need a single warrant to spy on the entirety of the Internet, without exception, and this warrant is approved by a former ASIO agent who is independent of the government. Both ASIO and the Australian Federal Police are gaining more powers with regards to terrorism, both real and suspected, and are lobbying the government for more power. Despite ASIO being a civilian agency, they're steadily applying for powers that would give them the rights to make arrests under certain circumstances, which would make them into a literal secret police. In Tasmania, a proposed bill that will most likely be passed will make all forms of protest illegal, in any public place whatsoever, punishable by a minimum of 3 months in jail without exception. They're trying to steal our rights and take our jobs and healthcare, and then we can't protest against how despicable we think they are.

The government has ripped out our only climate change prevention policies, and then expected the carbon emissions and prices to go down. Both of them have gone UP. They're the only country not to make some kind of commitment to at least trying to lower emissions, and this is because we have a Prime Minister who doesn't believe climate change is happening.

false,Puzzle33,ZZZZZZhirondelle,Hirondelle,"Salut!

Je vais commencer par te dire que je suis désolée de ce qui t'arrive. Mais il ne faut pas que tu te laisse bouffer par le passé. Tu as bien fait de mettre fin à une situation dans laquelle tu étais la victime, tu n'a aucun regret à avoir là-dessus.

Mais dans ce genre de situation, de ce que j'ai pu en voir, il est vrai que ça se vit différemment de l'intérieur que ce que les autres en voient de l'extérieur. C'est très dur pour quelqu'un d'extérieur d'aider quelqu'un qui vit une telle situation, parce qu'on ne peut en percevoir que l'aspect ""généraliste"", et pas la dynamique propre.

J'ai pu faire un stage dans une association d'aide aux victimes, et j'ai vu qu'en cas de violences, souvent, la victime se sentait responsable des coups qu'elle percevait, parce qu'elle avait fait à chaque fois quelque chose qui avait ""énervé"" son agresseur"". Que parce qu'elle l'a énervé, elle mérite le coup, qu'elle n'aurait pas dû faire ce qu'elle a fait, que quelque part, c'est de sa faute.
Il faut prendre beaucoup de recul pour s'apercevoir que quelqu'un d'ordinaire ne réagirait pas d'une telle façon, que quelqu'un de ""normal"" gérerait autrement la contrariété, gérerait autrement sa relation à autrui.
Crois-moi, il faut beaucoup de courage pour faire ce que tu as fait, car une personne dans  un tel cas fait souvent preuve d'une incroyable faculté d'abnégation et même de déni (c'est-à-dire qu'elle s'oublie en tant que personne et nie ses envies, ses pulsions, sa colère pour tout transformer en culpabilité déplacée). 
C'est d'autant plus difficile que souvent, la personne qui subit la violence est placée dans un état croissant d'isolement, et que, de façon perverse, finalement, c'est son bourreau qui la comprend le mieux (pour expliquer, le bourreau va s'apercevoir par définition du moindre petit rien, percevra la moindre intonation, le moindre changement, le moindre regard, ce qui souvent l'énerve, mais au moins, il remarque tout alors qu'a contrario, le reste des proches ou amis ont sous les yeux quelqu'un qui subit tout ça, mais ne le remarquent pas ou bien ferment les yeux). 
Le pire est que ceci est le modèle familial : même une mère qui voit ses enfants se faire battre ne va pas agir, pour ne pas énerver davantage. Dans son esprit, elle protège en faisant ça. Surtout que la police ne peut agir que dans des cas précis, souvent sur constat de coups par un médecin légiste ou flagrant délit (il vaut mieux se rendre dans une association traitant les violences, ils connaissent les solutions d'hébergement).
Beaucoup de personnes n'agissent jamais, ou changent d'avis en cours alors qu'elles ont besoin d'aide. Donc, je répète, tu as fais quelque chose de très courageux.

Je fais exprès de détailler le mécanisme ici, des fois que certains vivant une situation similaire puissent trouver un début de réponse.

Pour revenir vraiment à ta situation, tu ne dois pas refaire l'histoire et culpabiliser. Ce n'est pas parce que tu as pardonné à ton père que lui comprend vraiment qu'il a été en tort. Je ne sais pas s'il a été suivi psychologiquement (il y a des associations qui s'occupent aussi de médiations familiales, qui proposent aussi d'ailleurs de superviser les visites de parents violents, et qui accompagnent psychologiquement victimes et coupables de violences familiales, tu devrais te renseigner, ils s'occupent aussi de réinsérer socialement si besoin), s'il a bien compris d'où venait son problème, car il y a souvent une cause sous-jacente consciente ou inconsciente.
Tu sais, renier sa famille est aussi une réaction très violente. Dans son cas, ça fait aussi partie du cycle de l'abus : il vit la situation qu'il n'a pas contrôlée comme une injustice. Encore une fois, cela fait partie des réactions ""anormales"" de ces personnes. De toue évidence, il n'est pas ""guéri"". Quelqu'un d'autre dans son cas aurait finir par comprendre que toutes ses réactions sont disproportionnées. Il lui reste du chemin à faire.
Ça ne signifie pas que comme ta mère et ton frère, tu doive lui tourner le dos. C'est normal que tu l'aimes. Tu as le droit de lui pardonner aussi, du moment que tu reconnaisses toujours ce qui s'est vraiment passé, que tu as été sa victime. Personne n'a à te dire comment réagir.

Par contre, il en ressort plusieurs choses : d'une part, tu as eu un modèle d'homme adulte assez catastrophique, et d'autre part, que tu as toi-même voulu de suite mettre la situation derrière toi, ""oublier"", sans forcément apprendre à la gérer émotionnellement.

D'abord, tu es très jeune. Tu as certes eu une expérience que beaucoup d'autres n'ont jamais vécu et ne peuvent pas tout à fait comprendre, mais tu n'as pas idée du nombre de personnes qui vivent des trucs terribles dans leur enfance. Il est possible de vivre avec un tel passé. Heureux même.
Commence par te focaliser sur les personnes qu te veulent du bien. N'attends pas l'approbation de ton père, ne te torture pas avec ça. Met-ça dans un coin de ta tête et occupe le reste à te faire du bien.

Ouvre-toi aux autres aussi. Il faut élargir ton cercle de connaissances : fais une activité autre que ton métier qui t'intéresse, tu rencontreras des personnes qui ont les mêmes centres d'intérêts, ça facilite la communication. Que ce soit du sport, un jeu, une association, du bénévolat, vas-y, fonce! L'important, c'est que tu ne sois pas seul, et que tu sois entouré de personnes bien intentionnées envers toi.
Téléphone et discute avec les gens que tu vois trop peu, apprend à connaître tes collègues. Plus tu seras entouré de personnes qui t'aiment bien, plus tu étofferas ton système de support. C'est important dans ton état.

Ne reste pas seul chez toi, ou avec quelqu'un avec qui tu t'engueule fréquemment.  Il n'y a pas que l'alcool qui est ton addiction : il y a le geste qui devient pavlovien, il y a le fait d'oublier, de débrancher le cerveau, de se mettre dans un état second. Plus tu te tiens éloigné de la bouteille physiquement, mieux tu y arriveras.

Parle à tes proches de ton alcoolisme. Et surtout, à ton médecin. Il y a aussi des associations autre que Alcoolique Anonymes, ton médecin les connaîtra surement. Sinon, demande à des associations d'aide aux victimes ou à des psychologues judiciaires, ils travaillent souvent avec (dépose une demande avec ton numéro de téléphone, c'est rare que l'agent d'accueil soit au courant). C'est plus approprié, tu es accompagné dans ta démarche au lieu d'être seul à gérer tes démons.

Quand au manque : c'est en partie une projection de l'esprit : en réalité, même si tu étais en contact avec ton père, dans une relation saine, tu ne vivrais pas avec lui, tu ne le verrais pas tous les jours non plus. N'idéalise pas ce qui se passerait, mais ne pense pas à la mort non plus. Ça peut arriver, bien sur, mais sans être médecin, tu me semble en pleine dépression : l'impossibilité de se projeter autrement que dans le morbide en est l'un des symptômes. Il y a des façons de traiter ça, je ne peux pas te dire laquelle sera la plus appropriée pour toi. Mais sors de ta coquille, fais-en une priorité.

Autre chose, pour laquelle je ne suis absolument pas qualifiée, mais que je te conseillerais quand même : renseigne-toi que ce qui s'appelle la psychologie transgénérationnelle, ça devrait t'aider à t'apercevoir de certaines choses, ce qui t'aidera surement à reprendre ta vie en main et rebondir.

Pardon pour le roman et tout le charabia, mais j'espère que tu trouveras un peu d'aide au milieu de tout ça. Prend bien soin de toi. Je te souhaite bon courage pour la suite, et beaucoup de bonheur à l'avenir.

Il *jargon* di questi SJW svitati è degno di un gruppuscolo di sinistra extraparlamentare del secolo scorso, ma l'argomentazione è pertinente: è scorretto indossare una camicia come quella al lavoro o in pubblico, perché rischi seriamente di arrecare offesa ad altri che vista la situazione non possono ragionevolmente sottrarsi.

? I never claimed so.

&gt;You are still using Scotsman in the linked reply anyhow, and you are even tweaking the definition of feminism to the point of negating it (they don't have a voice and they are happy with how society is?) because you don't have another argument than Scotsman.

I really don't see where I'm using Scotsman. I'm saying that out of all the feminist I know, none of them says crazy things like that and from my personal experiences I make the assumption that there is a silent majority, who doesn't feel the need to complain about crazy stuff like the so called feminists from the article/picture.

Also how am I tweaking feminism? An example would be great, cause it seems that you are making stuff up.

And to the part in the parentheses: I'm not saying they don't have a voice or are happy with the way society is right now. I'm saying that the people I know here in Denmark aren't yelling ""inequality"" all day (of course they do, when something blatantly stupid is happening) and they don't feel the need to do that, because they know that things are finally going there way now.

He is best remembered for his defensive tactics at the [Battle of Cartagena de Indias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cartagena_de_Indias) (1741) in modern-day [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia), where Spanish forces won a decisive victory against the British navy commanded by admiral [Vernon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Vernon).

&gt;In his life he was known as ""*Patapalo*"" ([Pegleg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegleg)) and later as ""*Mediohombre*"" (Half-man), for the many wounds suffered in his long military life.

What they neglect to mention is that France is not a democracy. In the transcripts from 1789 you can see people explicitly rejecting ""democracy"" and advocating for a ""representative government"" instead, which is the regime that is still in place today.

« Les citoyens qui se nomment des représentants renoncent et doivent renoncer à faire eux-mêmes la loi ; ils n’ont pas de volonté particulière à imposer. S’ils dictaient des volontés, la France ne serait plus cet État représentatif ; ce serait un État démocratique.

The best thing about it in my opinion is [the royal armoury, where you can see real weapons and armour used by kings and nobles](http://saltaconmigo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Madrid-PalacioRealArmeria.jpg)

- The Palacio de correos, a beautiful building which used to be the central building of the country's mail system and now holds the major's offices and a large public area with art exhibitions. Apart of the  building itself, it is also an interesting place to visit because you can access the rooftop and get great views of the city centre, and also because it has a free access resting area with sofas and free wifi in case you need a rest.

Ok, how much clothing does a person need to wear to not be ""skimpy"" and offensive? I mean both the pictures of a person on a person's clothing, and a person themselves.

Could short shorts be offensive? Short skirts?  Is there a line we can draw? Below the knee, above the knee? This exact discussion actually goes back to the core of feminism as early as the late 1970: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_sex_wars

The problem with drawing a line is that it tends to slip. It can slip in any direction but most often is tends to slip backward. This why many people consider sex-negative feminism neo-puritanic.  Because it's arguments for why sex, and especially the display of female sexuality, are offensive, sounds a lot like ancient puritanical arguments.

Trying to get adequate working conditions for factory workers in Pakistan, or equal rights for women in Muslim countries, is a much greater goal than attacking a man over his choice of clothing. Of course, the whole feminism movement is a shadow of its former self in this regard ... I'm of the opinion it lost all its grand goals/ideologies about a decade ago.

everbody who won a district gets a seat, and you get a number of seats based on much/many(?) percent of the total vote your party got, however if you have people who already won their district they get subtracted from that. so if your party got enough votes to get 10 seats in parliament and you also won 7 districts the first 3 people of your party list(oh yeah the parties rank the people they want to have in parliament on lists, which determine the order in which you give people the seats you got through the Zweistimme votes) but there is no system to regulate the other way around, so if you win 10 districts but only get enough  votes to send 2 people jackshit happens. This is one of the major problems with seat distribution, since if 10 districts all vote candidates from party A into office through the Ersttimme but party A does get 0 votes through the Zweistimme you can end up with a severly bloated parliament because now you also have to give seats to party B C and D(since they all have more then 5% of the total amount of Zweitstimmen) despite the fact that they didn't win a single district.

Had an american exchange student as an aquaintance for a while, and he remarked how when visiting to the doctor's he was unsettled by the fact that the doctor didn't joke about him with what he had. That made him think it was something very serious and start to panic. I'm not sure if that was just him or if that's customary in the US, but as a rule of thumb when talking to secretaries, doctors or people in similiar positions, Germans tend to be serious and concise as part of our understanding of being friendly.

Naturally, mileage might vary depending on individual characters and the stereotype about humour is not at all true, it's just different and among peers :)

On a different note, when driving with a car - depending on how populated or how much of a travel hub the area you move into is - there are a lot of traffic jams. 80 mil people on this small an area just cause a lot of traffic, no way around it. Public transportation in Germany tends to be a lot more punctual than in other countries, however.

From what I hear about medical professions and their available university courses, they tend to be in high demand. Good grades are very important to not end up at the back end of a long queue of applicants. This at least holds true for the straightforward ""doctor"" kind of medical studies, no idea how it is for other medical professions.

Looking further into that article and others, I ended up on [this different page](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundeverbringungs-_und_-einfuhrbeschr%C3%A4nkungsgesetz) about an overall federal law in Germany prohibiting bringing pit-bull/bull-terrier/staffie-terrier types of dogs in at all. Our boy is really important to us and we won't leave him. The thing is, there's a paragraph that I can't really understand via Google Translate, so I'm wondering if you can help me understand what it implies.

The translation I'm working with says ""Movement of animals of these breeds to Germany from abroad is prohibited. Also prohibited is the introduction of dogs of dangerous breeds, which determines the respective national law, from abroad in the country. [3] It may be moved or imported for the purpose of permanent holding in the domestic dangerous dogs if the accompanying person proves that the dogs right may be held in a country."" 

The German version says: ""Das Verbringen von Tieren dieser Rassen nach Deutschland aus dem Ausland ist verboten. Ebenso verboten ist das Verbringen von Hunden gefährlicher Hunderassen, die das jeweilige Landesrecht bestimmt, aus dem Ausland in das jeweilige Land.[3] Es dürfen gefährliche Hunde zum Zweck des ständigen Haltens in das Inland verbracht oder eingeführt werden, wenn die Begleitperson nachweist, dass die Hunde berechtigt in einem Land gehalten werden dürfen.[4] Mit Freiheitsstrafe bis zu zwei Jahren oder mit Geldstrafe wird bestraft, wer dem Gesetz zuwiderhandelt. Fahrlässigkeitstaten sind mit Geldstrafe oder Freiheitsstrafe bis zu einem Jahr bewehrt.""

Could you (or someone) help me understand what's meant by the part that translates to the last sentence I quoted in English? Something about possibly being able to prove that the dogs are meant to move permanently?

Dopo una vacanza devastante a Lloret de Mar - località turistica di infima lega sulla Costa Brava scelta a caso su consiglio di un belga ubriaco incontrato durante la nostra prima notte in Spagna passata a Barcellona - che ebbe come preambolo una notte letteralmente passata in strada al porto vecchio di Marsiglia con due tentativi di rapina di cui uno sventato da un'entraineuse dal cuore d'oro - con le ultime poche pesetas in tasca ci avviamo per Girona e aspettiamo il nostro treno. Un tramezzino in tre in tutta la giornata.

Il treno arriva ed è uno scatafascio di gente buttata a dormire fin sopra le cappelliere. A Port Bou - stazione di confine con la Francia - controllo doganale di massa. Per qualche motivo scendiamo tutti dal treno. Nella calca un tunisino che aveva già cacato il cazzo per tutta la tratta precedente adocchia il mio zaino e, colto il momento, lo acchiappa e si invola verso i binari. Nel tentativo di attraversarli si pianta di faccia su una rotaia e si sfonda i molari. Recuperiamo lo zaino mentre quello conta quanti denti gli mancano, un ferroviere ci copre la ritirata attirando l'attenzione di un paio di doganieri che fortunatamente non erano lontani. Dopo aver mostrato documenti e biglietti risaliamo sul treno e il viaggio prosegue senza fastidi - tranne la fame - fino a Nizza. 

A Nizza prendiamo un treno locale che ci porta fino a Ventimiglia. Niente di che, direte voi, ma qui c'è il però: la data era 17 luglio. Ovvero il giorno che precede l'inizio del G8 a Genova - cosa che noi, beatamente isolati nel nostro campeggio pieno di olandesi fino al giorno prima, ignoravamo del tutto. Immaginate quanto fosse gradita alla polizia di frontiera, alla Polfer, alla polizia normale che schieravano forze massicce in loco la vista di tre deficenti zozzi e affamati con chitarre appresso. Veniamo fermati e ci viene chiesto con insistenza che cazzo andiamo a fare a Genova. Noi caschiamo dalle nuvole e assicuriamo gli ottimi funzionari che non abbiamo alcuna intenzione di raggiungere il capoluogo e che anzi non vediamo l'ora di tornarcene a casa. Alla fine riusciamo - biglietti per Torino alla mano - a convincerli che non siamo dei caporioni dei social forum ma solo dei cazzoni in gita. Ovviamente dopo una perquisizione più che accurata di tutto il nostro bagaglio e delle nostre persone.

Preso finalmente il treno - mentre la popolazione locale metteva apertamente in questione la nostra rettitudine morale e anche l'integrità dei comportamenti dei membri femminili delle nostre famiglie - a quanto pare sciami di black block avevano causato non pochi danni in stazione nelle giornate precedenti - ci accomodiamo in uno scompartimento vuoto. 

A Cavallermaggiore, Cuneo, sale infine un indiano con tanto di turbante, baffo a manopola e abito tradizionale stile kolossal di Bollywood che per un'ora filata cerca di piazzarci una partita di tessuti, bene di cui era un grossista rinomato in tre continenti.

La parmigiana della madre del mio amico - che da buona calabrese ci portò direttamente in stazione nei tupperware - non ebbe mai sapore così dolce.

As a female software engineer, you're right, I'm not going to be so pathetic that dumb shirts will put me off. If I met this guy in person, we'd probably end up giggling about it down the pub.

However, when choosing a job, I really am looking to minimize my exposure to sexist environments. I have absolutely no patience for that shit, and I will have to start the jobsearch all over again after a few months, which is a waste of everyone's time. I would much rather not end up in a sexist environment in the first place. It's also pretty hard to determine in advance, and so little clues to internal culture go a long way.

What he's done is to present this shirt without context in a very public way, whilst representing his company. This is dumb, because it's put a negative question mark in my head against ESA, that they think this sort of attire is suitable for the workplace, and that their senior scientists don't perhaps don't take women seriously.

Neither of these things may be true, of course, but it doesn't stop my perception of ESA getting slightly tarnished. Next time I go to the jobs market, I might look at my options, be toying with taking the financial hit of space industry work (wages get a bit suppressed, because space is possibly the coolest thing ever and everyone wants to do it), then remember this debacle, and decide to leave it a few years, until that sector has matured a bit. This is exactly how you end up with shitty gender ratios - lots of people doing these calculations, based on datapoints like this shirt.

So yes, he's made a dumb decision that has tarnished his company's and sector's reputation a little. Apologise and move on. Well done to him.

Three things that obviously are not counted in there that are very significant:

a) US private donations. I mean, Bill Gates probably beats the hell out of all the Nordics by himself (certainly if Norway isn't included), and he's just the tip of the iceberg

b) US military assistance. Every time there's some big natural disaster like a tsunami or earthquake, there's this basic assumption that because US has carriers and helicopters and stuff it'll go fly to the rescue. I would **love** to see the fiscal estimate of how much it'd cost the EU to have the capability to pull off the rescue/resupply etc operations the US has managed in the last 10 years. 

c) US flex budget that can - again - often come from the department of defense or department of state. Ebola, various famines etc often get a reaction out of the US, but using quite specific resources often linked to the military which won't show up in the correct spending category.

so people wouldn't want to work for ESA/any other top organization in its scientific or commercial or charitable fields if both men and women wore shirts depicting the half-naked members of the other gender? 

This is a stupid argument, if you don't feel like working for ESA because of the lower wages and because well you're obviously not interested enough then say that instead of going the easy route and blaming it on a shirt. 

Honestly this whole gender ratio butthurt seems to come mostly from women underachieving. Not working for 80 hours a week is a legitimate choice; it just means you won't go as far as the males who are more likely to do that in for example finance.

 That women are less likely to make that choice than males is just what ends up making those gender ratios what they are for the most part (and contributing to that ""wage gap"" in the case of the whole working 80 hours a week thing.) Instead of blaming women's underachievement on things like shirts you should just admit you're not interested because of other far more pertinent reasons.

If women really can't stand the sight of crudely drawn half-naked females, or if people seriously think that a woman or man would be pushed away from working at the ESA due to something as insignificant as choices of clothes then I'd say those people are the real sexists. Are women all weeping willows that can't handle themselves? Because modern feminism has become completely indistinguishable from religiously based victorian prudishness and traditional conceptions of women.

Where are the rebels? The antagonists? the woman who would wear a shirt with half-naked guys if she was bothered by his shirt in the first place? Or even just somebody who told him hey maybe this is inappropriate, other women might get the wrong idea about you just a heads up instead of tweeting some nasty snide shit on twitter about it instead. 

Feminism has no more spirit, no effectiveness, no purpose anymore. Its been ridden by shallow, ignorant, PC-obsessed idiots whose only method is censorship in greater and greater quantities. 

I really do hate modern feminists. I volunteer at my country's major anti-human trafficking charity where we deal with women who do suffer from real, tangible issues but I don't think any of the women working here with me either as my bosses or the founder would have the idiocy of trying to solve this problem through bitching or complaining because they're people trying to make a difference. And what's funny is that I don't see any of the tumblrinas or hardcore feminists coming over or trying to help. The most they ever do is complain about prostitution in general and with idiotic arguments too. In fact I'd consider them to be less than helpful in actually effecting positive change for marginalized women.

So you know what, fuck your lowest common denominator. I'd rather go back to second or first wave feminism than the high minded smug, useless shit going on today.

And by the way, according to [this article](http://www.jcm.org.uk/blog/2007/02/racial-representation-in-the-european-parliament/) the EU parliament was until recently 99% white, with 5 of the 9 non-white MEPs coming from Eurosceptic Britain. 

Anybody who walks around Brussels will be shocked at how few non-white people work for the EU (I myself never saw one) compared to the member states.

Additionally, the idea that women in the West should do their best to help their developing counterparts is a flawed idea. Western women do not know the societal and cultural background of the billions of women in developing countries.

**Protested against possible red-red-green government in Thuringia**

4000 people protested last Sunday against a possible coalition of red-red-green (namely The Left, Social Democrats and Greens). Instead of an expected 600 people, more than 4000 showed up. The reason
for the protest is ties of several member of The Left that have direct ties to the Stasi and would be in government if the coalition happens.

**Plans for Sexual Education in Baden-Württemberg divide parents**

Future Sexual Education shall include diversity and equality of sexual orientation. While no actual plans have been made how this would incorporate into the curriculum, many parents are on the street
demonstrating against ""pornographization"" and ""gender-ideology"". The progressive education plan seeks to include all forms of sexual activity in the curriculum to prepare students - this includes ""swallowing, dirty taking and
other sexual practices"". Opponents of the change in curriculum fear that it will demote family values. They base their opposition on the current working paper including points such as alternative family
structures and explanation of other sexual orientations such as gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transsexuals, transgenders and intersexuals (I hope I translated them correctly, sorry if I made a mistake here). The
new sexual education curriculum is planed to start in Autumn 2016.

**Green Party Report on Paedophilia in the early years released**

The Green Party was open to Paedophilia in its early time as the report found. The report was presented by a research team from the Walters Institute in Göttingen, commissioned by the Green Party leadership to clear up the
Paedophilia accusations. Today's Green Party strongly opposes the old position, but works on clearing them up. The researchers praised that seldom they have experienced less interference when doing political research. The findings
stand in contrast of the narrative of success that is surrounding the Green Party. Several regional party programs included calls for decriminalizing sex with children between the years 1979 and 1985. The younger generations of the
Green Party war astonished by the reaction of many older Green Party member who had been active in the time in question.

**Bafög and internal cooperation increased**

The German student loan Bafög has been slightly increased by 9% to 45% percent depending on the kind of money (living allowance, maximum delivery, additional income limit, asset allowance and child grants). Further the ban on
cooperation between the federal government and state government in science has been slightly lifted. The ban is a relict from the founding days when the Allies wanted to impede Germany from growing strong again. They forced Germany
to set up its federal system such that each state competes against the others and the federal government. Therefore nearly every institution in Germany exists 17 times (except of state institions that cover foreign affairs). The lifting
will allow the 16 state education ministries and the federal education ministry to cooperate more closely and push reforms.

The act of taking a picture of a nude child with the goal of selling or trading it is ~~now punishable by law~~ *now punished harder and apparently easier to prosecute*. Further sexual offenses become time-barred later and child-grooming (contacting children via the internet and encourage them
to do sexual acts) is prosecuted harder.

be stationary at the major bus hub where the police could easily control the situation. Th voice great opposition 18 counter-demonstrations were
registered with the city. The strong opposition is partly due to the escalation in Cologne, after which many felt that civil society had not spoken
up loud enough against hooligans amongst which many neo-Nazis can be found.

**Gender-main-streaming on pedastrian traffic lights**

The city of Dortmund wants to replace broken traffic lights for pedastrians with a green woman instead of a green man until 50% of the city's pedastrian traffic lights are using women. The practise is already in place in Berlin-Mitte, 
Bremen, Dresden, Magdeburg und Zwickau. Erfurt goes a bit further and [their greem man do all kind of things](http://www.erfurt-web.de/Erfurter_Ampelm%C3%A4nnchen).

**Neo-Nazis in the city council of Dortmund want a list of all Jews, Kurds and HIV-positives in the city**

The neo-Nazi city councillor Dennis Giemsch provoked the city council by demanding a list of the address of all Jews, Kurds and HIV-positives
residing in the city. NGO's warned that the consequences of such a list have been known from the Nuremberg Laws in 1935 and hope that the
request will remain unaddressed or denied. Since the last local elections ""Die Rechte"" (engl. ""the right"") has one city council member who is
ignored by the rest of the city council and denied any cooperation beyond the necessary (like speaking time).

If Germany can proof that TTIP and CETA fall under the competences of a member state (and not only the EU), then Germany can simply opt out by voting on TTIP and CETA in the parliament.
They would then vote to cancel certain passages such as investor protection. Background is the Germany is afraid that American or Canadian companies could sue the German state for compensation if
investor protection was to be passed.

**European Court of Justice (ECJ) allows Germany to refuse social welfare payments to EU citizens with no intent to work in Germany**

Based on the case of Romanian woman the German Social Court in Leipzig asked the ECJ to make a ruling. The woman was not trained in any trade and did not work back in Romania either.
She wanted to continue not working and tried to receive social welfare payments in Germany. The ECJ clarified that social welfare payments can be withheld if the person in question is not willing to work.
Note that any EU-country can kick out people who are perceived as only collecting welfare payments after 6 months of economic inactivity. This case expands the current state of the art in the sense that these payments can even be
withheld when there is a credible reason that a person will not work before the 6 months are over.

**Germany circumvents recession by a margin of 0.1%**

Officially Germany had a growth of 0.1% in the third quarter. After a quarter of negative growth the positive quarter stops Germany from falling into recession (by definition two quarters of negative growth).
Main sources for the slow growth are identified as the ongoing international crises, but also a loss in confidence in the domestic policy. The reduced investment in Germany foreshadows reduced growth as it will
reduce the productivity in the time to come.

**US Congrass plans to stop paying the pension of former Nazis**

A new bill is in the making to stop pension payments to former Nazis. The background is that Nazis could seldom be charged for their crimes as most were not directed against Americans. Only lying when immigrating gave the US
a possibility to prosecute them. To solve the problem back in the day, Nazis were given a full pension if they left the US on their own. At least 38 individuals took the deal and several million dollars have been spend over the
course of the last three decades. Amongst the individuals are Waffen-SS members working in Concentration Camps and the rocket scientist Arthur Rudolph (who used slave work to build the V2 rocket and later was honored by NASA for
helping to put a man on the moon). This comes as a reaction to New York Times reports that more than a thousand former Nazi have been used as spies against the USSR in exchange for no prosecution.

This question makes more sense in the context of the American university system. There are literally hundreds of health-related MA degrees in Germany with a wide range of qualification you get out of and effort you have to put in. 

The quality of education in most German universities does not vary as much as in the States where you would get recommendations to definitely go to someplace like Standford. 

In Germany, most universities provide similar levels of education. But it might be important to consider that e.g. size of the department: If it is very small, you might not get to see or do the more advanced stuff, if it is too big it can be very anonomous. 

There is one important distinction. It is between universities (Universitäten) and universities of applied sciences (Hochschulen, Fachhochschulen). As a very general rule of thumb, the later provide education in fields with less theoretical and more practical demands - that is not always true. What is true, however, is that it is sometimes considerably easier to get into a program at a Hochschule compared to a University and that it is also easier to get your degree. But you will also earn a little less in the long run than you would had you graduated from a Universität. 

If you are interested in becoming a doctor or surgeon in the classical sense, there are some top universities in Germany but with very tough competition. From my experience, it does not really matter in the long run where you studied as things like personal engagement and so on become more important over time. 

For a MA in something like health care management, it will be easier to get into. And for this or similar subjects it might make more sense to study at a Hochschule rather than at a Universität.

Economic growth from 2008 to 2014 is higher than Germany (Germany fell and then came back, France didn't fall at all).

Large corporations in France are stronger than ever, with profits growing much faster than inflation! The French elite school system comes just after the US top 3 universities for providing Fortune 500 CEOs!

Unemployment may be higher than in other countries, but this is because poverty is low thanks to a high minimum wage. Is it better to have a neoliberal system like in Germany, with perfect flexibility and no minimum wage ? The result is low unemployment but plenty of working poors instead (the nice union agreements doesn't exist for slave-like service jobs).

Also, in France women work. In Germany, many women are housewifes (which doesn't count as unemployment).

Thanks to great family policies, we have one of the best demographic metrics in Europe, while Germany will crumble with tons of old people and few youths.

Exactly. They give free money to hypercorrupt governments. What do you think its used for?

The top layer needs money to keep the lower layers loyal. Thanks to ""aid"" they can.

If you want to read a real world example of this, I'd recomment [""The Road To Hell""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Hell_%28book%29).

If you want to *see* it in practice, go to Kenya or Uganda and see all around you how ""aid"" has destroyed the local garment industry. Ironically, garments being usually the first industry a country adopts on its way to actual development. Now even that ""start off industry"" was destroyed by our ""aid"" in most of Africa.

But believe what you want in you comfy armchair in the First World.

Sorry, but that explains it. You are studying something that has *never* worked in the real world and is only based on believes and good intentions.

During my time in Ethiopia, I learned that half the country is studying ""development"". They don't study engineering or anythng that would *actually produce value*, because the NGOs and IDOs just pay better. Perpetuating the vicious ""aid"" circle.

&gt; as simplistic and populist

That's what NGOs do. Actually, I am at a point that I am about to start an NGO as well. Nobody wants to hear the truth anyways, so I will just start some NGO with a name that contains all the buzzwords, collect money in Europe and play Santa Clause in some poor country, having a good life. Everybody will love me because I am the one handing out free money. That's what ""aid"" is about in practice.

Then you do two years of student teaching, up to half a year of which is now usually completed while an individual studies.  

School cultures and atmospheres are significantly different than in North America as well.  Instead of the students coming to the teacher, it is the teacher that changes classrooms.  Most students spend all day, every day together for years, and from the teacher's perspective, there is a strange us vs. them attitude.

If you're really interested in becoming a professor, then study here.  Also,  keep in mind that becoming a professor here requires a whole lot more work than in North America (not just a doctorate, but a Habilitation), and the academic job market in some areas is just as oversaturated as in North America.  Germans often have the mentality that if something isn't certified on a piece of paper, then it isn't so.

Queues in Paris and London are almost 1 km long

people started gathering since last night

inside the country there are lots of reports of voting fraud ( mainly by voting tourism, people drive in cars or buses from station to station and vote everywhere) and the police does nothing. These votes are usually estimated to be worth a few % so it's big. Lots of pictures on fb showing this phenomenon happening now.

it's bad if PSD ( socialdem party who is the big party in the government coalition - PM is main candidate) wins because they already have parliament ( over 60%), government, the general prosecutor, the ombudsman, the media watchdog ( being investigated btw) and some other structures on their side.

apparently the Dublin section ( only one in Ireland I think) hasn't been opened yet or it happened a few hours late

some people have to drive a few hundreds of km to the nearest section since they are rare

someone in Canada even flew 670 kms while turnout will probably be ~60pc or less so millions rather not bother to vote ( btw low turnout helps the PM win)

gendarmes were called in Paris again where 3500 wait to vote and it takes 4 hours

5000 in Wembley

Berlin at noon http://imgur.com/GwmoCy4

so far it looks like the PM is winning 56pc at 11 

RIP romanian constitution ( Paris last night at the embassy) http://imgur.com/ebImKIw

turnout so far apparently is 3pc higher than in 2009 at the same time when PSD lost again.. so this is a good sign

the new Foreign Affairs M. appointed just a few days ago said initially that he will be in Paris at 7:30 to vote and now at 2pm changed his mind and has a bs excuse. Earlier the bastard recommended people to go vote 400km away in Nancy

3 hours ago queues of 10 000 reported in London

in Torino someone put dropped his stamp in the voting box when he put his vote in. Now voting will be even more difficult because it can't be opened to retrieve it. Gendarmes came.

the PM is gonna be in deep shit regardless of results

hundreds of meters long queue in Dublin. Many went to Belfast instead which is 160km away.

the tv channels behind the PM say that the voting sections in the diaspora are actually empty

leaders of some parties are outside the country trying to vote there. They probably won't be able to.

the government can give emergency ordinance to extend voting time. It loves to use e.o. but it won't now since it doesn't help the PM win.

so far, the PM is losing everywhere in the diaspora

16.00: 51,42%/ 48,58% for the PM without the votes from diaspora and the voting tourism fraud

Edit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_of_Rhodes#Location_of_the_ruins

&gt;The statue stood for 56 years until Rhodes was hit by the 226 BC Rhodes earthquake, when significant damage was also done to large portions of the city, including the harbour and commercial buildings, which were destroyed.[9] The statue snapped at the knees and fell over onto the land. Ptolemy III offered to pay for the reconstruction of the statue, but the oracle of Delphi made the Rhodians afraid that they had offended Helios, and they declined to rebuild it.

&gt;The remains lay on the ground as described by Strabo (xiv.2.5) for over 800 years, and even broken, they were so impressive that many traveled to see them. Pliny the Elder remarked that few people could wrap their arms around the fallen thumb and that each of its fingers was larger than most statues.[10]

&gt;In 653, an Arab force under Muslim caliph Muawiyah I captured Rhodes, and according to The Chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor,[11] the statue was cast down and sold to a Jewish merchant of Edessa who loaded the bronze on 900 camels.[12] There is compelling evidence that long before the Arab invasion all traces of the Colossus had already disappeared.[citation needed] The stereotypical Arab destruction and the purported sale to a Jew possibly originated as a powerful metaphor for Nebuchadnezzar's dream of the destruction of a great statue, and would have been understood by any 7th century monk as evidence for the coming apocalypse.[13]

&gt;The same story is recorded by Barhebraeus, writing in Syriac in the 13th century in Edessa:[14] (after the Arab pillage of Rhodes) ""And a great number of men hauled on strong ropes which were tied round the brass Colossus which was in the city and pulled it down. And they weighed from it three thousand loads of Corinthian brass, and they sold it to a certain Jew from Emesa"" (the Syrian city of Homs).

Two things I care about are atheism and personal freedom, but when I see atheists jumping the shark into ""ban all religions by law"" I step in and voice my opinion, and I at least show that not all atheists are like that.

I am against religion and I don't want it to be given any preference by law, but if you choose to believe in a higher power that's your right and no one should take it away from you.

If there are feminists out there that don't agree with the current line of thought they should step up and make their opinion known, lest they all be painted with the same brush.

false,SnobbyEuropean,EURO,Orbánistan aka the Banana republic of the EU,"I started in kindergarten. It wasn't that popular at the time to teach English to kids so young, so my kindergarten was kind of an exception. It was useless, though. We learned words such as ""kitten"" and ""sausage"" without offering context or anything. That was our level I guess. At the end of the day, we all knew the ""jiggle balls"" song, and that's it. In elementary school you have to learn a foreign language. It's mostly English, but German is pretty popular nowadays too. Some schools teach Russian, Dutch, or French though. In high-school some schools offer students a chance to focus purely on foreign languages for a year. It's called ""year 0"". In this case by the end of the year you have to pass an intermediate or advanced language exam.


You can't really choose not to learn a foreign language in Hungary. You can try passing with a 2 (out of 5, Hungarian grading system. A 1 means you fail.) then going to a school that doesn't give you a matura in order to avoid the language exam, but that's kinda dumb.  


The way English is taught in Hungary is outrageous in my opinion, though. I went to said ""year 0"" and it was useless. You're basically told what to say during the language exam. Most teachers don't care about actual knowledge, they just want to produce students with papers that say they know their shit. For example, ""What do you do in your free time?"" is a question that pops up on every exam. To prepare yourself for this question, you have to memorize what the teacher writes on the blackboard, then repeat it after her. Not your own thoughts or anything, you just have to give an answer everyone in your class will also give. They basically tell you the questions and the answers, you memorize them, and at the end of the day, you don't know shit, you can't hold a conversation, you can't use English. 


Hilarious story: Friend goes to intermediate language examination. He brings his exercise book with him. He reads through the lines he'll have to say without knowing what they actually mean. Goes in, all pumped up and confident. Question: ""What do you usually wear?"". His answer: ""I usually wear skirts and dresses. In winter I like to wear layered clothing because that keeps me warm...""  He studied the ""female version"" of the answers for months, and he didn't even notice.

The CDU got their list entitlement in the direct seats, however the SPD got one more seat than they were entitled to. How does that work?

Or at a Landtag state election level, in Saxony there are 120 seats, but the CDU won 4 more FPTP seats than entitled to through the list vote, while The Left and SPD both won 1 more seat than entitled to making the seat number 126 in the Saxony Landtag, but the AfD and Greens stayed with the number of seats they were entitled to. How did they work this out?

*  Margins for companies (I'm not really sure how to say that, I mean ""taux de marge"") are lower than in the rest of Europe

* Private investment has been falling and is much less profitable than in  most other European countries

* Venture capital is low and offers a worse return on investment than in other countries

* The housing market is broken, most notably prices are artificially propped up by the low rate of new constructions and by government grants for renters (""allocations logement"")

* Unit labor costs are higher than other European countries such as Spain, Italy

* As for unemployment it mainly exists among young people (under 25) and seniors. While youth unemployment is largely due to increasing duration of studies and is therefore not that worrisome, there is a real problem with unemployment among older people that is mostly due to their cost and an inferior system of continuing education

I could have mentioned the weight administrative formalities have on companies, which leads to important threshold effects (companies that do not want to hire more than 50 people because it would be very costly) but our government's action in this area has to be acknowledged and logically should bring results.

**Living quarters, Flats etc.:**

If you rent an appartment /flat in germany it is totally empty. No furniture, no kitchen, no apliances, no light bulbs nothing. We germans bring our things with us in the next flat or buy the things if it is our first own flat. Flats with a kitchen or even furniture are very rare. If you want a flat with a kitchen seach for a Wohnung mit Ebk (Einbauküche). If you want a furnitured flat search for, ""möblierte Wohnung"", (expensive).

Just in the last 2 decades we started to move around more, before it was not unusual to work in the same company from apprenticeship to retirement. 

Germany is a land of tenants, tenant rights are high in germany, if you buy a house be sure there is no sitting tenant in it, you cannot throw them out, it is very hard to get a tenant to move out.

It is good to join a local Mietverein (club of tenants) if you are a tenant, they help you if you have problems with a landlord. If you are a landlord join the local club for landlords (Haus und Grund).

**Insurance:**

Health care Insurance is mandatory
In my opinion public insurance is the best especially for families. Be aware if you ever leave public insurance and go private, it is hard and sometimes even impossible to get back into public insurance. Private mabe cheaper if you are young and healthy and have no children, but later it will be expensive.

Second layer (high school) : While there was true issues amongst the people, for lack of food reserve during climatic-induced shortages, the actual movement was leed by aristocrats willing to take advantage of the uproar for political issues. They were certainly not democrats, they just wanted the power for themselves and got it through poll-tax based elections. Universal polling came a few years later when some more heads got chunked off.

Third layer (rarely taught) : the revolution really never occured. Power shifted from divine-rights to aristocrats, that's still true nowadays. Fundamental rights as defined by 18th century philosophers have been torn appart over the years to keep the necessary facial values and ensure submission of the ill-educated people. The entire 1789 episode was just for show because cultural values didn't evolve that much. Resurgence of patriotic and familly values during the 20th century and of nationalism nowadays demonstrate the lack of grasp most people have over humanism values.

false,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"&gt; I presume that, when working out how many seats a party is entitled to you would use the full seats of a region?

As I very clearly explained in the video, it is the party list vote that determines the share of the seats each party is entitled to. Each constituency initially elects one direct representative; then, the party list vote is used to allocate additional seats such that each party has the right proportion of seats. Thus, if a party polled 43% of the votes in the party list vote, the second vote, they should end up with 43% of seats in the Bundestag.

&gt; I assume the full seats (pre-balance seats) would simply be double what the constituency seats are?

I'm not completely sure what you're asking here. But the total number of seats in the Bundestag is about double the number of constituencies.

&gt; how do the Germans deal with overhang?

As of 2011, they increase the number of seats overall until the proportions are correct. These are the ""balance seats"". Before then, overhang seats were simply retained, but this was ruled unconstitutional.

&gt; The CDU got their list entitlement in the direct seats, however the SPD got one more seat than they were entitled to. How does that work?

Uh... the SPD got one more direct seat than they would have been entitled to according to the party list vote. The number of seats was increased so that the percentages could be made to add up without having to exclude any directly elected representatives.

&gt; in Saxony there are 120 seats, but the CDU won 4 more FPTP seats than entitled to through the list vote, while The Left and SPD both won 1 more seat than entitled to making the seat number 126 in the Saxony Landtag, but the AfD and Greens stayed with the number of seats they were entitled to. 

So, basically, the CDU was over-represented at the expense of the SPD and the Left. Removing 4 direct representatives from the CDU would have disenfranchised 4 constituencies, leaving them without a representative in the assembly. So instead extra seats were given to the SPD and the Left, and this corrected the anomaly.

Obviously it's not going to be accurate down to the last tenth of a percentage point. It just has to be accurate *enough*, although I can't tell you what constitutes ""accurate enough"".

However, reality is a bit more complicated. Maybe this is the 500th incident of sexism you've seen and it's the last thing required to convince you to do something else, or maybe it simply creates a more uncomfortable work environment so you decide to do something else after working for a while in addition to many many other factors.

No-one (or no-one sane( is saying that one single decontextualise thing like this is wholely determining of women's choices to pursue science or not. The issue rises when one sees things in more of a context. For example this may trigger other people into doing other sexist things at work making it more unpleasant, it may be construed as tacit support for sexism... Etc.

first this: there's no real political ideology

many left the country after joining the EU and in those times PSD was badly seen because of 2000-2004 ruling of PSD ( [Iliescu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Iliescu) president - honorary president now and still active - and [Nastase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_N%C4%83stase who is still loved by the party) PM who got in prison 2 times). Iliescu is responsible for the Mineriads in the 90s when protesters were beaten and some killed by miners called by him. People didn't like that the new power after the revolution ( looks more like a coup) were 2nd rank communists ( No lustration). That's why we're stuck in transition to democracy. The system hasn't been cleansed and the first election after 1989 is very controversial ie the opposition to FSN ( led by Iliescu) was attacked and things like that. The European HR Court said the Mineriad case must be reopened because there has been no solution and Iliescu is untouched. *The expats still remember these things.*

Now one current problem is PSD's campaign which was very nasty ie they criticised the opposition's candidate for being childless, promoted the bs that he sold kids, is nationalistic and promotes being romanian and orthodox which Klaus is not ( has citizenship though). Propaganda that Klaus ( the other candidate) sells us to Germany, Russia, China or.. everybody. Sells Transylvania to the magyars. Lots of bad things like that. The church was caught openly supporting the PM telling people in church to vote for him. And then there's bad governance and protection of his many crooks ( even the *current* deputy pm is being investigated, not just lots of ex ministers), terribly biased media behind him similar to fox news and russian media. The PM was caught plagiarising his doctorate thesis and lieing about having a masters from a uni in Catania. Lots of lieing in general. He criticised prosecutors for investigating Russian firm Lukoil and is very pro China which isn't popular. He wants to 'take political control over the anticorruption agency'. There's also an accusation that he was ( is?) a spy while he pretends that because he is young, he isn't affected of the 'old system's virus'. Apparently he spied on a UN prosecutor for Yugoslavia in the late 90s. He has support from a rightwinger and populists. etc etc etc etc etc

Per total, the best way to describe *Social-Democrats'* (PSD) campaign is using my grandmother's description: they're using the same tactics as the communists in '46 and the neo-communists in '90.

Pretty much everything is wrong:

* The entire campaign was based on slandering the other candidate, Klaus Iohannis (ethnic german, former professor, no children, lutheran). From a candidate who when confronted with his plagiarized doctoral thesis simply replaced the commission with his own buddies and declare the previous ruling ""an error"". From a candidate who divorced his wife so he could marry a subordinate of his. The very man who in his campaign claims to unite Romanians has left them more divided than ever. He is the one talking about morality, and accusing the other human trafficking. It's disgusting.
* The Romanian Orthodox Church has been paid great amounts of money out of emergency funds, and in return orthodox priests were ordered to tell people to vote for *""a romanian family-man, orthodox candidate who is afraid of God""*. [LINK](http://www.gandul.info/politica/circulara-primita-de-preotii-din-cluj-inaintea-turului-ii-acuma-n-o-am-in-fata-dar-stiu-ce-trebuie-sa-spun-13517847)
* The Ministry of Foreign affairs took absolutely no steps to help voting abroad. To the contrary, fewer polling stations were established. After heavy protests, the Minister was changed (also from PSD) but did absolutely nothing. Now PSD will have an excuse if voting goes poorly: the new Minister didn't have time to take any steps.
* PSD retired personnel from polling stations around the world to ensure there are less functioning voting cabins.
* Inside the country, in the southern counties Olt and Teleroman electoral tourism was, and still is in full swing. There are reports of vehicles transporting 10 to 15 people from other locations to vote on the ""additional lists"" for non-residents (which are NOT cross-checked, and allows people to vote in multiple locations)[LINK](https://www.facebook.com/sabin.gherman/photos/a.432183090237928.1073741828.425603624229208/626772577445644/?type=1&amp;theater)
* Famous case of fraud: the commune of Colonești, Olt county, where the ex-mayor (his son is now mayor) is standing with 5 meatheads to ensure everyone votes for PSD. [LINK](https://www.facebook.com/cristineagoe/posts/10152669160547819) Meanwhile the same cars, with the same drivers, but different people coming to vote keep showing up. [LINK](https://www.facebook.com/casa.jurnalistului/posts/785290748208923)
* Liviu Dragnea, one of the higher-ups at PSD, had the nerve to call Teleroman county (of the the poorest and least attractive places) a popular tourist destination and that explains the high number of people voting on the ""additonal lists"" for non-residents, but at the same time can't understand how Cluj (THE city of choice for university students country-wide, with a massive population of students) has a high number of voting non-residents. [LINK](http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/dragnea-constat-ca-teleorman-a-devenit-atractie-turistica-pentru-votantii-lui-iohannis-13499756)
* Gogosu in Mehedinți county has a presence of 263% | Oravița from Caraș-Severin County has 166% - all with a majority voting on additional lists from non-residents [LINK](http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-politic-18575176-analiza-votului-ora-13-posibili-indicatori-frauda.htm)

These are just a few things.

I can guarantee that if Ponta is elected, there will be massive protests all around. And believe me, there were some decent sized protests against him to begin with.

EDIT: More added.
EDIT 2: More details coming in.

* Gabriela Firea, spokesperson of PSD, who previously attacked Iohannis for not having children, announces the intent of PSD asking the Central Electoral Bureau to shut down polling station #152 in London because she *presumes* there was one account of fraud. [LINK](http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Special/COTROCENI+2014/Gabriela+Firea+reclama+vot+multiplu+la+sectia+de+votare+152+din+)

* Supposedly, a text received from Liviu Dragnea, campaign chief for PSD got into the hands of a news agency. Apparently after the warning message asking campaigners to stop the flow of electoral tourists until 4 PM because there were numerous reports to the National Anti-corruption Department was received, cars and busses stopped showing up at polling stations in Buzău county.

He was mayor of Sibiu for a long time and he turned it into a very nice city, much prettier than most here. He had problems making it into the big level politics, the current president didn't want to name him PM in 2009 and Klaus's party left the alliance with PSD last February iirc and went into opposition because the PM didn't want him to be minister of the interior affairs. It's kinda like the system doesn't want him. He's appreciated outside the country too which I can't say about the PM.

No debates for the 1st round. The PM imposed that he wanted debates on 4 private tv channels, all biased. Little to no negotiating. We had only 2 of them before the 2nd round and it was obvious that there is a big difference of character between the 2. The PM lost overall.

Under Irish law, only companies with their 'main base of operations' in Ireland pay irish corporation tax. This company is registered in Ireland, but its operations are in another country, it is not liable to pay irish corp tax. If this was a swiss registered company with its directors in Ireland, it would have to pay the irish corp rate of 12.5% on the 7.6 billion. 

This is being changed per the last budget. In two years (i think) all Irish registered companies no matter where they're based and all companies with a main base of operations in Ireland will have to pay corp tax here.

But judging by your comments and the literature you are referring to you either don't believe it or don't mind it. 

&gt; It seems the socialist have made modern Germans feel a disproportionate amount of guilt over an exaggerated shame.

For the majority part after the war the conservatives of the CDU were in power. But I guess to you the whole of Central Europe (Scandinavia, Germany, France) is a big socialist glob. With all the ""free"" state healthcare, Unemployment benefits, rather cheap University education and what not. 

&gt; Such as those who feel Germany got a raw deal after both wars. 

There is the sentiment that the Treaty of Versailles was rather harsh. It certainly made it easier for someone like Hitler to rise to power so easily and blame the ""others"" for everything that went wrong in the past. 
But then again, as one of the instigators of the WW I and subsequently beaten nation its what you somehow deserve. 

&gt; Rather than rely on academics who do no primary source researching, I prefer the professional historians who spend time in the archives, and seeking &amp; analyzing other undiscovered primary sources.

There is grave electoral fraud commited. Multiple independent observers are reporting it.

Per total, the best way to describe *Social-Democrats'* (PSD) campaign is using my grandmother's description: they're using the same tactics as the communists in '46 and the neo-communists in '90.

Pretty much everything is wrong:

* The entire campaign was based on slandering the other candidate, Klaus Iohannis (ethnic german, former professor, no children, lutheran). From a candidate who when confronted with his plagiarized doctoral thesis simply replaced the commission with his own buddies and declare the previous ruling ""an error"". From a candidate who divorced his wife so he could marry a subordinate of his. The very man who in his campaign claims to unite Romanians has left them more divided than ever. He is the one talking about morality, and accusing the other human trafficking. It's disgusting.
* The Romanian Orthodox Church has been paid great amounts of money out of emergency funds, and in return orthodox priests were ordered to tell people to vote for *""a romanian family-man, orthodox candidate who is afraid of God""*. [LINK](http://www.gandul.info/politica/circulara-primita-de-preotii-din-cluj-inaintea-turului-ii-acuma-n-o-am-in-fata-dar-stiu-ce-trebuie-sa-spun-13517847)
* The Ministry of Foreign affairs took absolutely no steps to help voting abroad. To the contrary, fewer polling stations were established. After heavy protests, the Minister was changed (also from PSD) but did absolutely nothing. Now PSD will have an excuse if voting goes poorly: the new Minister didn't have time to take any steps.
* PSD retired personnel from polling stations around the world to ensure there are less functioning voting cabins.
* Inside the country, in the southern counties Olt and Teleroman electoral tourism was, and still is in full swing. There are reports of vehicles transporting 10 to 15 people from other locations to vote on the ""additional lists"" for non-residents (which are NOT cross-checked, and allows people to vote in multiple locations)[LINK](https://www.facebook.com/sabin.gherman/photos/a.432183090237928.1073741828.425603624229208/626772577445644/?type=1&amp;theater)
* Famous case of fraud: the commune of Colonești, Olt county, where the ex-mayor (his son is now mayor) is standing with 5 meatheads to ensure everyone votes for PSD. [LINK](https://www.facebook.com/cristineagoe/posts/10152669160547819) Meanwhile the same cars, with the same drivers, but different people coming to vote keep showing up.

* Liviu Dragnea, one of the higher-ups at PSD, had the nerve to call Teleroman county (of the the poorest and least attractive places) a popular tourist destination and that explains the high number of people voting on the ""additonal lists"" for non-residents, but at the same time can't understand how Cluj (THE city of choice for university students country-wide, with a massive population of students) has a high number of voting non-residents.

These are just a few things.

I can guarantee that if Ponta is elected, there will be massive protests all around. And believe me, there were some decent sized protests against him to begin with.

EDIT: More added.
EDIT 2: More details coming in.

* Gabriela Firea, spokesperson of PSD, who previously attacked Iohannis for not having children, announces the intent of PSD asking the Central Electoral Bureau to shut down polling station #152 in London because she *presumes* there was one account of fraud.

* Supposedly, a text received from Liviu Dragnea, campaign chief for PSD got into the hands of a news agency. Apparently after the warning message asking campaigners to stop the flow of electoral tourists until 4 PM because there were numerous reports to the National Anti-corruption Department was received, cars and busses stopped showing up at polling stations in Buzău county.

* PSD propaganda TV station Antena 3 says the polling stations outside the country are empty. These images were taken by TNR, the equivalent of The Onion.

[90 protesters arrested at the arrival of Sinterklaas]
(http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2014/11/sixty-arrested-in-anti-piet-protests-as-sinterklaas-arrives-in-gouda.php/)

**For context:** We have a very popular national holiday called Sinterklaas, where an old man and his black helpers (Zwarte Pieten) arrive by boat and give presents to kids. Almost all kids under 8 believe Sinterklaas is a real person. There has always been a bit of a discussion about racism, since some people see the helpers as slaves. Still, it was never really a big deal.

That is, until last year, when a woman from the UN started complaining about it. This sparked a massive discussion and a lot of controversy, though no action was taken in 2013. The debate was rekindled this year and very heated arguments were taking place among the Dutch population. It is an extremely sensitive subject for most, since Sinterklaas is a very loved and valued tradition. Most Dutch citizens disagree with the proposed changes, such as rainbow-coloured or white ""Pieten"". People started protesting, both in favour and against keeping Zwarte Piet as it is.

Now, since the arrival of Sinterklaas in the Netherlands is an event many young children go to, the government banned protests in the area where this event would take place. A lot of people didn't listen. The police arrested them. Many people are angry, either at the protesters or the police.

Quoting the New Zealand Government here:

&gt; The countries negotiating the P4 agreement aimed to provide a high-quality vehicle for economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region. This means that the P4 agreement was designed so that other countries could later come on board. In 2009, negotiations were launched to expand the agreement beyond its original four members. The shortened Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) title is being used for this process.

The TPP we are talking about here is basically the TP SEP that is being expanded, its already in force within those four countries and being expanded to include others, this whole process is called TPP, the old agreement is been renamed TPP, the new one (when it comes into forces) is going to be called TPP. Hence why I called their old agreement TPP and not TP SEP or P4. 

In any case, this nitpicking bears little relevance to the original point that the EU should be building on these current agreements to a get a larger and more comprehensive one with the original p4.

Rumors diverge on if it is spinal cord cancer or pancreas cancer.

The party accused the duo of Turkish background to cater too much to conservative Turkish organizations that supposedly slow down integration of Turks in Dutch society. According to party leaders they didn't put their primary loyalty to the social-democratic principles Labour stands for, but rather the interest of their Turkish voter base. The two MPs criticized the more strict party line on immigration and the policies of Lodewijk Asscher, the Labour immigration minister who criticized the Turkish organizations. The two will continue as independent MPs, reducing the Liberal-Labour coalition's majority in parliament to 69, just two above the required 67.

Ich glaube für die meisten Menschen sind Verschwörungstheorien ein Mittel um sich die Welt schwarz und weiß zu malen, um sich ein einfaches Weltbild zu schaffen, weil man nicht damit zurecht kommt, dass es eben doch komplizierter ist als es den Anschein hat. Natürlich male ich mir jetzt selber das Bild da eher einfach, aber gut.

Es macht mir teilweise Angst, wenn ich mit Leuten spreche und die mir mit voller Überzeugen erzählen, dass es Chemtrails gibt und im Endeffekt nur das Nachplappern was man in etlichen Verschwörungsvideos sieht. Was mir dabei angst macht ist dieses Blinde vertrauen, ohne auch nur Dinge zu hinterfragen, eigene Nachforschungen zu machen. Das erinnert teilweise an Propaganda, der Menschen unkritisch trauen.

Als ich so 14-16 Jahre alt war, bin ich selber ein wenig in diese Richtung abgedriftet. Das fing Anfang meiner Teenagerzeit an, da war ich von Aliens fasziniert und war der Überzeugung das Aliens tatsächlich auf der Erde waren. Hatte da auch so ein schönes Buch von meinem Vater geschenkt bekommen, wo Vorkommnisse von Aliens auf der Erde ausgeglichen beschrieben wurden, z.B. Roswell, Kornkreise etc. was fake war und was nicht etc. 
Hatte da auch dann nen Buch von Erich von Däniken ""Botschaften und Zeichen aus dem Universum"" was ich glaub ich zu hälfte gelesen hatte, der unter anderem die Theorie hat, die heutigen Menschen seien eine Kreuzung zwischen Aliens und vor tausenden von Jahren lebenden Vorfahren der Menschen, die sich miteinander gepaart hätten oder so. Habe ich auch nur zur hälfte gelesen weil Däniken eben viele Kritiker auch aus der Wissenschaft hat, fand ich aber trotzdem hochinteressant wie er das alles so beschreibt.  Seitdem bin ich auch vom Weltraum &amp; Raumfahrt fasziniert.



Dann kamen die 9/11 Verschwörungstheorien an und ich fand das ganze interessant, hatte mir dazu allerdings auch eine differenzierte Meinung gebildet. Da kamen dann auch so Sachen wie Chemtrails rein, denen ich aber immer schon ziemlich skeptisch gegenüber stand. Und die ganze Sache mit der NWO und so ein kram konnte ich auch nicht wirklich folgen, da gabs einfach zu wenig und zu 99% nur Vermutungen und Theorien.

I totally debunked that. As for Obama spending the biggest spending was in 2009 as the result of the Disaster that Republicans left in this country and the spending in 2009 were actually already planned for Obama (except for the stimulus), since then he actually reduced spending. 

""obamacare"" -- again you'll hear hicks talking about it in a negative way, while is not a great piece of legislation it does protect millions (you know: MILLIONS) more Americans. If you don't live in US you don't know that healthcare insurance is a clusterfuck. Obamacare at least fixed some really bad things, for example if you lost your work or if you were self-employed you'd be on your own, now is different, and in a very good way. It actually encourage to be entrepreneurial and encourage job mobility. And many other good things. Basically a large majority of the Americans LIKE what Obamacare brings but when you ask them about Obamacare they don't like it because of the propaganda.

I'm sorry, I live here and I've never seen that from Obama. And actually black people are pissed on him that he doesn't do something extra for them. 

&gt;Not a word about Romanian politics, nor the whole point of this discussion. Should i assume that i was right about it?

I can write about Romanian politics but I didn't follow it closely for more than 15 years. Of course you can assume you are right. Although, just to point something, there are no communist parties in Romania and even the social democrat ones are pretty centrist, we do have parties from before Communist period that were revived and led by people who spent years in Communist prisons, as for the provenience of the leaders in general, since during Ceasescu's regime about 3.8 millions were members of Communist party (basically everybody over 18 who ever had a leadership role were forced to join the party) is obvious that at least at the beginning they were ""former communists"" but that doesn't mean much after 25 years and it will be less and less relevant. But yes, there's choice, there always is in democracy.

I have no clue about the entry requirements for a referendariat, but you need one if you want to become a regular teacher at a German school. At my school are some teachers who are not German, but they all originate from the EU and they all made 

I teach Maths and Physics at a Gymnasium in Rhineland-Palatinate and I had the opportunity to look into some Canadian schools in BC a couple of years ago, so I might point out some of the biggest differences I experienced.

Teachers in Germany usually teach two subjects and they teach all the grades their school kind provides, so I teach Maths from grades 5-13 and Physics from grade 7-13. 

The following is from grade 5-10:
Every subject is generally taught for the whole school year, with a few exceptions. 

Students can't chose, which subjects they have, unless it's a language or religion. They have 2-3 languages and they can chose, which language they will learn first, which one second and if and which language third. The languages usually are English, French, Latin and depending on the school, Spanish, Italian and ancient Greek. 

So German students have a LOT of different subjects during their week, up to six different ones at a day.
German teachers have a lot of different groups and quite a age span to work with.

This leads to a totally different approach towards teaching than I experienced in Canada. 

If you really think about teaching in Germany then I'd recommend that you try to become a Foreign Language Assistant first.

Ganz richtig. Aber ich sehe hier eben nur Nötigung, sexuelle Belästigung und vielleicht versuchte Körperverletzung, aber keine Vergewaltigung.

Und ums nochmal zu sagen: mir gehts nicht darum, den Typ zu verteidigen oder zu rechtfertigen was er tut. Denn das was er tut ist abstoßend. Aber ich bin der Meinung dass die deutsche Sprache genug Ausdrucksmöglichkeiten bietet um das zu beschreiben als dass man ständig zum schlimmsten Vergleich zu greifen, weil das dazu führt dass eben dieser Vergleich entwertet wird und tatsächlichen Vergewaltigungsopfern vielleicht mal dann entgegengebracht wird ""Ach du bist vergewaltigt worden?

Historically the solution that has been applied to get out of such crises was [stimulus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_%28economics%29): discouraging saving and stimulating demand. And you just agreed that these things promote consumerism. Ergo, consumerism is unavoidable if you want to ""sustain the economy"" after an economic crisis. 

&gt; Seems to me like lower unemployment rate correlates with lower inflation.

That's because you're only looking at dates spanning the last year. Expand the dates a bit and you'll see the bigger picture. [Also, look at investopedia.](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflation.asp):

""The opposite of inflation, deflation has the side effect of increased unemployment since there is a lower level of demand in the economy, which can lead to an economic depression""

false,elblanco,null,null,"It's a comparison that's subtly difficult to make (U.S. vs. European foreign aid) because the mechanisms for the aid collection/deliveries and the thought processes behind what is ""foreign"" or not are very different.

It's an imperfect mapping between the two territories because they simply work differently.

For example, in 2012, the U.S. Federal government donated ~$50 billion. But $17.2 billion was in the form of military assistance (training, stability operations, weapons procurements, etc.). Economic assistance was ~$31b and USAID was ~$12b.

Private donations are not well tallied since they don't go through a centralized collection and disbursement source, but appear to total between about ~$70b-~$100b depending on source. But those figures also lump in ""remittances"" ($47b) with NGOs (~$10b). 

This puts total U.S. foreign aid at ~$120b-$150b for 2012. Still, a tiny fraction of overall GDP, but 2.5-3 times what just the official numbers show.

The EU provided ~$71b through official aid (compare to ~$50b for the U.S. official mechanism), but those numbers include *intra*-European aid (France giving to Spain), which the U.S. number does not include, and does not include private aid and donations. A study I found [1] claims 15 European countries donated ~$300b in private foreign aid, a number that dwarfs U.S. collections, but again this includes intra-European aid.  It's also harder to determine EU private foreign aid because of the very different legal status's of organizations across the EU territory.

This doesn't even dive into debt relief, direct commercial foreign investment, etc.

Is the U.S. the most generous foreign aid contributor as a percentage of GDP? Probably not. Is the U.S. generous in raw dollar amounts? Absolutely.

It's a very difficult Apples to apples comparison to make however, even if you spend a long time looking at the data. At a start, you'd either have to include U.S. internal spending on state development activities (analogous to intra-EU AID) and internal U.S. charities and organizations (while excluding home grown state charitable government and private activities), or remove those analogs from the European data. 

Right now the comparison is Apples to Socks, normalizing the figures this way would at least bring them both into food or clothing categories.

Ich muss allerdings an der Stelle deines Theoriebegriffes widersprechen:

&gt;Verschwörungstheorien brauche keine stichhaltigen Beweise oder Nachforschungen, deswegen heißen diese auch Theorien und gerade deshalb sind diese so gefährlich wenn Menschen diesen einfach Blind vertrauen.

Was du hier beschreiben möchtest hat bereits das Terrain der ""[Theorie](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorie#Definition)"" verlassen und ist zur [(Verschwörungs)Ideologie](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verschw%C3%B6rungstheorie#Verschw.C3.B6rungsideologien_und_Verschw.C3.B6rungsmythen) mutiert. Eine Verschwörungstheorie kann selbstverständlich wie jede andere Theorie ebenfalls streng wissenschaftlich aufgebaut sein. Dazu gehört auch die Möglichkeit der Falsifikation und daraus folgen Adaption an die neuen Erkenntnisse, sprich: die Möglichkeit der Synthetisierung einer neuen Theorie aus These und Antithese. Wo nun Falsifikation und Nachbesserung -also Synthese- der VT im Vorhinein ausgeschlossen wird, hat man eindeutig ein verschwörungs**ideologisches** Weltbild vor sich.

Allgemein finde Ich den Ideologieaspekt ziemlich wichtig zu betonen, denn diverse, vornehmlich irrationale, ideologische Verschwörungstheorien sind ja sehr häufig fest in unkritische -oder nur scheinbar kritische- Weltbilder eingebaut. Daraus resultiert dann eben jener starrer, ideologisch-irrationaler Zustand.

false,Krawall2,null,null,"Laut dem EUropean sind mittlerweile also alle offenen Fragen an Ereignissen ganz klar Verschwörungstheorien. 

Aha. Der übliche Beißreflex der Propagandainstitute wenn der Leser nicht mehr will wie sie es verkünden. 

Ich weiß ja noch wie damals alle als Verschwörungstheoretiker abgetan wurden, die behaupteten bei der kuwaitischen Krankenschwester handelt es sich um die Tochter des Botschafters welche im Auftrag einer Werbeagentur bezahlt von der US Regierung die Welt vor der UN belog um einen völkerrechtswidrigen Angriffskrieg gegen den Irak zu beginnen.

Hinzu kommt der Unsinn den unsere Presse seit Jahr und Tag verbreitet. Niemand glaubt denen mehr irgendwas nach all den Lügen die man einem aufgetischt hat. Selbst ehemals renommierte Zeitungen sind heute in Sachen Glaubwürdigkeit auf der Stufe von Blogs angekommen, die Aliens hinter Fukushima vermuten und Chemtrails für echt halten. 

Es nimmt sich schlicht nichts wenn die Presse irgendeinen nicht verifizierten Müll in die Welt setzt, speziell wenn sie einfach nur aus offiziellen Verlautbarungen von jemandem abschreibt, der selber eine Agenda verfolgt. Wenn die Presse sich auf anonyme Geheimdienstmitarbeiter stützt, dann können das Blogs auch. 

Und nicht zu vergessen, diese ganzen Verschwörungstheorien die wahr werden, jedes Mal ist unsere Presse überrascht, nachdem sie uns doch ständig zu erzählen versucht, dass da nichts hinter dem Tellerrand ist. Totalüberwachung? Verschwörungstheorie. Gladio? Verschwörungstheorie. Iran-Contra? Verschwörungstheorie. Keine Massenvernichtungswaffen im Irak? Verschwörungstheorie. 

Noch lustiger wird es ja, wenn die Medien den Menschen erklären wollen, was WIRKLICH passiert ist. Dann gelten schon mal die Gesetze der Physik nicht, Zombies laden Schrotflinten nach, Zeugen versterben an nicht erkannter Diabetes oder verbrennen sich aus Liebeskummer im Auto. Da kann ich auch ein Verschwörungsblog lesen, welches behauptet die NSU Terroristen seien Teil einer außerirdischen Invasion. 

Das ist ja leider auch das Problem der meisten Konsumenten. Selbst zu denken und die eigene Ansicht dann auch zu vertreten. Ne, lieber wollen die alle irgendwen haben der ihre Meinung stützt. Die suchen ja auch alle nur nach Bestätigung und versuchen nicht ihre Ansichten zu falsifizieren. 

Deshalb nenn ich das was die Medien so ablassen mittlerweile auch nur noch Verschwörungstheorie. Russland hat MH17 abgeschossen, Quelle anonymer BND Mitarbeiter? Aha, Verschwörungstheorie. Russische Invasion(mal wieder) in der Ukraine? Verschwörungstheorie. Amerikaner unbeteiligt an dem Putsch in der Ukraine? Verschwörungstheorie. Schweinegrippe extrem tödlich?

Man sieht, die Presse selbst ist nur jemand der Verschwörungstheorien verbreitet, die keiner kritischen Überprüfung standhalten. Also gilt die Kritik an den schlichten Geistern auch denen, die dem Glauben schenken was in der Presse steht und das ist wesentlich gefährlicher, denn diese hat die Macht einen Krieg herbeizuschreiben, während sich derjenige, welcher dann eben keine jährliche Grippeimpfung mehr durchführt, maximal selbst schädigt.

Am Ende bestätigt man das ja auch selbst:

* The left-leaning Victor Ponta, from PSD. 

* The right leaning and ethnic German Klaus Iohannis, from ACL

Ponta is also Prime Minister and was responsible for organizing the elections. Because the diaspora is right-leaning, there are suspicions that he intentionally sabotaged the diaspora vote. These suspicions have been strengthened by the fact that he promised that every Romanian will be able to vote in the second round during a debate, but no measures were taken and 12000 people are waiting in line just in London.

The esteemed candidate also held a highly detestable campaign, accusing Iohannis of everything from child trafficking to not being the 'correct' religion (he's Lutheran). There are reports of voter fraud coming in every hour and it's well known that he bribes poor farmers with oil, sugar and flour. His strongest argument is that the previous president is supporting his counter-candidate, which he officially wasn't until Friday.

Iohannis on the other hand had a clean campaign is very popular in the western part of the country, as well as in the diaspora.

You couldn't even make it from your second sentence to your last sentence without realizing this. The U.S. classifies Military assistance as Foreign aid and includes it in foreign aid figures, while the EU does not (though individual countries may include the figure, France has a notable foreign military assistance program for example). The EU is also not Europe and comparisons have to be made between the U.S. and the various interlinked economic cooperatives that exist between European states.

Comparing the U.S. to an individual country in Europe is silly. But comparing only one subset of Europe to the U.S. is equally silly. European aid to Albania is still intra-European, even if it isn't intra-EU or intra-Eurozone (though that will change fairly soon).

There's other matters, if some countries count debt forgiveness or investment as foreign aid, then European foreign aid figures should also represent southern European economic stabilization and investment activities, like with Greece. Then the European numbers would be much larger.

If we want an apples to apples comparison, you can't just include these things or claim they aren't part of the numbers (they are according to the methodologies for aid calculation). A charity in France that collects donations for poverty relief in Basque areas of Spain is ""foreign aid"" even if it isn't part of the French National Foreign Aid program. And again, many people count remittances as ""aid"". So somebody working in Maastricht and sending money home to Aachen counts as ""aid"" under international aid metrics.

Also, don't confuse ""net foreign aid donor"" with ""doesn't receive foreign aid"". Spain is currently a net donor, but it *does* receive foreign aid.

Likewise you can't just lump in all intra-European development activities, that would be like claiming the U.S. Federal budget is intra-U.S. development aid. You'd be kidding  yourself if lots of the U.S. budget wasn't intended for intra-American economic development and aid, but nobody classifies building a military base or lab or tax processing center as aid, even if the reason it's built where it is is to stimulate local economic development.

Here's a fun thing to ponder, Hyundai gets tax breaks for building a factory in the Czech Republic, that gets counted as development aid to South Korea. Even though South Korea is a net donor. It *also* gets counted as development aid to Czech Republic from South Korea. The numbers don't cancel each other out.

false,pwnies_gonna_pwn,EART,World,"one thing that comes to mind is the utter time waste in anglosphere companies when it comes to meetings. surely it is not the single cause, but its something that always amazes me. 

disclaimer: i know exceptions on both sides, this is anecdotal though a lot of peers share the same experience. this is more of a broad feeling and i cant tell much for non-it fields. i am not talking about meetings that come with a specific method of work like scrum, etc.

i worked in a couple of projects with several us or international companies, and it usually went down the way of half a week of meetings, another day of fucking around cleaning up the misunderstanding coming out of those meetings and one and a half day to get something actually done.

non-surprisingly most of the things that need to be arranged or agreed upon will be talked over at the coffee maker/water cooler/lunch as everywhere else too. 

however the meetingmania works different in germany and in the anglosphere: german meetings usually are centered around a problem that need group work. that usually doesnt result in nice meetings, especially when no solution was found. often its more of a heated discussion.

the other side feels for me much more like feel good events, there is much more bragging going on and much more fingerpointing. its much more on an emotional level and incentivizes everybody to share the same uniform perspective on things.

what is most astonishing to me is the difference in actual time spend in meetings: for some it-project in germany you usually have a jour fixe style thing once a week and probably two if things go into a hot phase. 

with us-shops i've experienced things like daily meetings about low priority, long term projects, additionally to the high prio stuff that i grew suspicious that the level of trust employees get is different on both working environments.

in the end both ways are terribly inefficient. the german way gives way too much speech time for the people who are afraid of everything and the anglosphere way is way too heavy on micromanagement and uniformity.

No problem. Another section on the article does state that it shall not interfere with the neutrality of NATO states dictated by NATO. 

Meaning that if Turkey would attack Greece, the TEU is not enforced for NATO members when NATO demands neutrality of it's members in that conflict. So that would be a war between Turkey and part of the EU, however that would end up (probably German/French/Dutch forces under their or EU flags against Turkey)

That is not just an example, that is the reason this was added, it was demanded by Turkey and backed up by the US, so added by the EU. As Turkey said they would end up isolated within NATO given their prospects (or lack thereof) of integration in the EU, and the US found that a reasonable concern.

false,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"The Barnett Formula is the Goschen Formula with 40 years of additions added on. As I understand it, the funding level in the 70s was taken, and any subsequent changes ran through the Barnett Formula. The first baseline represent less than 10% of the current block grant, inflation having significantly eroded its monetary worth. To start from the position that it's mainly based on 1890s population shares, to change it to a major role, to finding that it's actually only 10% percent....I have a word for your initial statement and that is 'wrong'. 

Absolutely, a needs based system might be far fairer but the Barnett formula, to some degree, accounts for it. Also, Wales does not have a similar geographic distribution to Ssotland. Scotland's population density is less than half that of Wales' and the most remote areas of the UK are in Scotland, with the Islands and Highlands. 

Regarding the subsidy, that isn't how it works in practice. The line is whether the per capita deficit is smaller or bigger, given that everyone is expected to pay an equal share of the 'credit card' bill, so to speak. Those areas with lower than average deficits subsidise those with higher than average deficits. Scotland has historically been a massive net subsidiser of the UK, with the different declining in recent years. 

And yes, the situation has changed with the recent oil price situation, but it's a) not as drastic as you imply, b) likely to corret back up in 2015, and c) ignorant of historical contributions. If Scotland is allowed to subsidise in its good years, it should receive 'subsidy', as you are wont to call it, in the bad years. 

EDIT: Either way, my preference is not for the continuation of Barnett, or for some needs based formula, but for Scotland to regain a large degree of fiscal autonomy and to be self funding. That is largely seems to be the will of the Scottish people too. They don't want subsidies or to subsidise, but to look after themselves.

false,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"I'm going to repost from one of the other threads on this:

OK, apparently somebody has to take up the contrary position and suffer the downvotes.

There are reasonable reasons for not having a CSA, and they are, unsurprisingly, the obverse of the reasons for having one. Essentially, they boil down to the two faces of a single fact, which is that having a CSA concentrates scientific policy advice in a single official and office.

**Pro**: increases the visibility of scientific advice, gives the scientific advice a clear advocate and champion.

**Con**: provides a single target for lobbying, fails to reflect how science works, makes the scientific advice actually championed highly dependent on the preferences of a single person, politicises the giving of scientific advice, is not actually there for the public.

I'm going to assume from the tenor of posts so far that these pro points are generally appreciated, while nobody has raised the con points, so I'll flesh out the latter:

1. *provides a single target for lobbying*: if we assume that the office of the CSA is not in fact omniscient, then it's as vulnerable to the actions of lobbyists as other such roles in an information gap. Drug companies will very happily provide reams of scientific papers showing their drugs to be safe, pro or anti-whatever groups will do the same. Lobbying scientists themselves is hard, lobbying a single scientific advisor is easy.

2. *fails to reflect how science works*: does having a CSA reflect the way science reaches conclusions? No, it doesn't. It can act as a simplifying mechanism which reduces the complexity of the scientific state of play on a question to a binary filtered through one person. That's a huge convenience for a top policy maker, because they have a go-to person who says yes or no. It's not so much of a convenience for the science itself, which may not have such a clear answer.

3. *makes the scientific advice actually championed highly dependent on the preferences of a single person*: nobody can give exactly the same level of support and championship to every single issue, and which issues are pressed more forcefully will depend on the preferences of the CSA. Not very satisfactory.

4. *politicises the giving of scientific advice*: usually a very wooly phrase, but I mean specifically that when one operates in an advisory capacity, one finds that one chooses one's battles. As in point 3, you simply can't win all the time, sometimes the person you're advising will be more resistant, sometimes less, so you will unconsciously begin to horsetrade the achievable against the necessary. If you give someone a courtier's role, they will adopt a courtier's habits.

5. *is not actually there for the public*: that's right. The CSA is like the Chief Scientific Officer in a company - they're there for the benefit of the company, not the customer. That has powerful implications, given the preceding four points.

What would be preferable, surely, is a Science Ombudsman, someone whose job it is - on behalf of the *public* - to ensure that the scientific advice going into public policy is the output of proper scientific processes, and to be publicly critical when this doesn't happen, or when scientific advice is available that contradicts policy choices but is ignored. Instead of politicising the process of scientific advice, subject it to external criticism and, dare I say it, peer review. To me, that's an approach more in keeping both with other public policy areas, and with the scientific process itself.

Now, I have to say I can't imagine the Juncker Commission ""firing"" (nobody has been fired, the post has not been continued into the new Commission) someone for a pro-business stance. Yet the idea that she has been 'fired' for opposing GMO appears to be the preferred narrative - and if she wasn't fired, and it's highly unlikely that the position has been axed simply because of one opinion, then this is *somebody's* preferred narrative. For all the reasons given above, it seems likely to me that the narrative is being promoted by the last people you might expect - the business lobbying community.",0,1416160519,null,0,1416160735,0,cm465kk,t3_2mgvmj,t1_cm465kk,t3_2mgvmj,null,1425997493,22,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,22

Wikipedia says 20-30k RuFed troops took part in the action.

Do you still stand by your claim ""What Russia did in Georgia on the other hand would be an invasion.""?

&gt;*aggressively enter territory controlled by another such entity*

Hundreds of videos and photos documented the arrival of LGM and their storming of Ukrainian army bases in the Crimea.

&gt;*Generally with the objective of either conquering, liberating or re-establishing control or authority over a territory, forcing the partition of a country, altering the established government or gaining concessions from said government, or a combination thereof.*

Russia said it was merely re-establishing control over area which has always been Russian, and they forced the partition of Ukraine as a result.

Das Wochenende war super. Einfach nur rumgammeln ohne, wie vorher, dauernd an Schule denken zu müssen. Außerdem war ich am Samstag
noch Fotografieren, ich bringe daher mal wieder Bilder mit, diesmal aus einer alten Baumschule: http://imgur.com/a/OTBVE

false,TheEastSaxon,null,null,"&gt; The Barnett Formula is the Goschen Formula with 40 years of additions added on. As I understand it, the funding level in the 70s was taken, and any subsequent changes ran through the Barnett Formula. The first baseline represent less than 10% of the current block grant, inflation having significantly eroded its monetary worth. To start from the position that it's mainly based on 1890s population shares, to change it to a major role, to finding that it's actually only 10% percent....

Inflation just scales up the original Goshen formula. Given that the inflation measure used is the UK-wide CPI, that does not change the relative ratios that each home nation receives. You are correct that there are subsequent changes that are added on based on more recent population changes, but they are a minority of the funding amount and the 1890s population ratios still have the dominant effect.

&gt; I have a word for your initial statement and that is 'wrong'.

I really don't understand why people like you throw in lines like this. Clearly, the fact that we're having a debate means that I think you are wrong and you think I am wrong. But stating this outright doesn't add to my understanding, doesn't add to your understanding, and only makes me and everyone else reading your post think that you're obnoxious. What's the motivation, other than making yourself feel more superior?

&gt; Absolutely, a needs based system might be far fairer but the Barnett formula, to some degree, accounts for it. Also, Wales does not have a similar geographic distribution to Ssotland. Scotland's population density is less than half that of Wales' and the most remote areas of the UK are in Scotland, with the Islands and Highlands.

The Barnett formula doesn't account for it at all. There is zero input into the formula that accounts for needs. Scots often claim that it does account for needs when it suits them, but then they also claim it accounts for population density when it suits them, and then it accounts for the amount they're paying in when it suits them. It seems to be awfully convenient that a formula that does not have any of the three as inputs ends up with Scotland getting really high spending per capita, so perfectly blends the three. Of course, no formula with these three things as actual inputs is ever put forward so we can judge objectively.

&gt; Regarding the subsidy, that isn't how it works in practice. The line is whether the per capita deficit is smaller or bigger, given that everyone is expected to pay an equal share of the 'credit card' bill, so to speak. Those areas with lower than average deficits subsidise those with higher than average deficits. Scotland has historically been a massive net subsidiser of the UK, with the different declining in recent years.

The bit in your logic that does not hold is that not everyone is expected to pay an equal share of the credit card bill. The South Eastern bits of England pay it off disproportionately. If the rest of the UK followed their example, we wouldn't have a credit card bill. Think about it this way: if there was a corporate partnership with ten partners, four of them lost £100k a year, four of them lost £50k a year, and two of them made £20k a year, are the middle four subsidising the organisation because they're losing less than the ""average""? No, two of them are managing to keep the company going, and everyone else is a drag. Now maybe some point in the future those middle four will pull their finger out and start paying back the debt they are accumulating for the whole, but until they start doing that, they are not subsidising anyone.

&gt; And yes, the situation has changed with the recent oil price situation, but it's a) not as drastic as you imply, b) likely to corret back up in 2015, and c) ignorant of historical contributions. If Scotland is allowed to subsidise in its good years, it should receive 'subsidy', as you are wont to call it, in the bad years.

a) Fair enough: it's $76 a barrel currently. I stand corrected. Still it's a lot closer to $70 than the $100 last year or the $110 the SNP's projections are based on. This isn't a tiny movement: it's a 25% drop, so has a huge effect.

b) It's not likely to correct back up in 2015. Oil futures for next year are projecting a pretty similar price to current. 

c) It has only been on a very rare year that Scotland subsidises. The vast majority of the time it takes out. ",0,1416161317,null,0,false,0,cm46jii,t3_2mga9l,t1_cm46jii,t1_cm45w2r,null,1425997312,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2
