Les US récompensent ceux qui sont leur bien soumis et sanctionnent leurs concurrents. Or dans le cas de la BNP c'est très clair : il s'agit d'un avertissement concernant l'Iran. Les entreprises françaises sont en concurrence avec les US pour le marché iranien, et ces derniers veulent les exclure.

C'est d'ailleurs ce qu'il s'est passé avec PSA : les US ont exigé le retrait de PSA en Iran pour ensuite s'y installer avec GM. Coût pour PSA : 500 000 voitures.

Ce n'est donc pas le poids politique, mais la menace qui conditionne les sanctions. Or la France menace bien plus les US que le Royaume Uni au niveau géopolitique. On a encore des partenariats avec l'Iran et la Russie par exemple, et on risque de les faire chier avec le traité transatlantique.

De Gaulle was wary of the US exerting its influence on the EU via the UK as the UK/US historically have very close ties.

This led De Gaulle to use his veto powers to stop the UK joining the EU as De Gaulle was staunchly anti-American, condemning the war in Vietnam, the West's nuclear strategy, the structure of NATO and West Germany's dependence on Washington.

If De Gaulle had allowed the UK to join the EU i think things would look very different today. I imagine that the US would have liked to see a United States of Europe and wanted the EU to work more closely as to avoid a third world war.

Another point to consider is that when NATO was being considered by the US congress, at the time; the then current president (~1950) thought that NATO would eventually become an EU only deal, with Canada and USA becoming less committed after about 10 years.

From this I draw the conclusion that the EU would be almost identical to the US, with greater influence on current affairs and possibly a blue water navy (a man can dream).",0,1400163545,null,0,false,0,chimcbw,t3_25mcb9,t1_chimcbw,t1_chikgmk,null,1433807507,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Joe Biden's older son is also involved in politics and announced he will be running for governor. I wouldn't be surprised if Hunter Biden has similar ambitions, and is taking this opportunity to gain experience/reputation in foreign affairs.

The biggest and most important economic sector Ukraine needs to address is energy due to Russia's strong grip. This sector is known to be especially corrupt, and a lot of the causes for this corruption are well understood by WorldBank.

==============================================================================

 I am guessing Hunter Biden has taken on this job because he is trusted by IMF and its associated US and EU governments. I don't doubt even a bit that Hunter's ability to fill this position will be helped by close connections he has with western government. Energy is heavily regulated market everywhere in the world, and Ukraine will need these type of connections to escape Russia's grip.

You can say these money aren't the same, but that's the exact problem - money are interchangeable.


That's one of many reasons why tracing money such way is stupid - you can choose whichever source you want, and you won't be wrong (or right).


Another reasons include impossibility to look at the end result in closed feedback system like global economy, and the fact that most of the money in circullation is actually debt, and the more people borrow each other - the more economic activity is going on.

true,thewimsey,null,null,"Something else you might consider would be attending an American college for two years and then going to Germany. This is worth considering for a few reasons. The first is that two years of college in the US is usually considered the equivalent of an Abitur.  The second is that it will give you more time to improve your German.  This may or may not be necessary in your particular case, but it's worth noting that in *most* cases at my school, HS students who took the language placement exam for the foreign language requirement were able to test out of only 1 semester per two years of HS language learning. So four years of HS would put you in third semester German - which is not really enough to jump into college classes.  And even the best HS students tested out of one college semester per HS year - and 4 semesters of college German is probably enough to mostly follow along in class, and to be able to do the readings with frequent use of a dictionary, but it's not going to be enough to produce college level written work.

However - you may do better in your classes than average, or do outside work. And with the equivalent of 4 semesters of German + 6 months immersion and attending classes, you will quickly reach a much higher level of proficiency (with writing still being something of a sticking point.  But German universities tend to be fairly flexible, so it's easy enough to avoid classes that require papers for a while - for a long while depending on what you study).

The third reason to think about doing two years of college classes is preparation.  German universities are not more rigorous than US universities, but German HS's are (leaving aside outlier colleges and outlier HS's), which means that most German students will come to the university with a much better preparation than you will likely have had.

The fourth reason is kind of intertwined with the previous - it will be hard for your first university experience to be in a language you don't understand well - many people have trouble adjusting to college level work in the US, and it's going to be harder if you have to adjust to college level work in a different country.

But, having said all of that, you still have a lot of time to consider options and prepare.

These five sections accounted for 37.6% of the overall exports.

if Germany just steps up it could change everything, the rest of europe is highly unlikely to oppose this notion, meaning America would not be able to make a bold move. Therefore this would just intensify diplomatic relations and demonstrate to the rest of the world that europe is still separate and not a puppet. For, if America decides to make a bold move
it would create vast controversy around the globe. Hence making a clear statement that Europe is opposed to human rights infringement
which will make it more difficult for America to argue against, as it  is the so called land of 'freedom'. This has so much potential, but the power lays with so few.I think they should give the people a vote on it.

&gt; Just two days before the International Day of Conscientious Objectors, the 47 year old D. Sotiropoulos - pioneer of the movement - was sentenced to 10 months with a 2-year suspension for insubordination in peacetime

&gt; On the occasion of the International Day of Conscientious Objectors, Amnesty International urges the Greek authorities to bring its legislation and practice with the European and international law and human rights standards.

&gt; As the organization notes, conscientious objectors should not be arrested, prosecuted, fined them and imprisoned because of their refusal to enlist in the army or because of their refusal to perform alternative service is punitive or discriminatory.

[...]

&gt; Meanwhile, Amnesty International reiterates its concern about the punitive nature of alternative civilian service in Greece :

&gt; Those who have a conscientious objection to military service is required to serve an alternative civilian service is 15 months , which is much longer than the nine months military service in the Army , where he serves the majority of conscripts .

&gt; As such, it is punitive and discriminatory against conscientious objectors to military service , and , therefore , incompatible with European and international human rights standards .

&gt; Continuing arrests and trials , in violation of international law


&gt; Amnesty International is concerned about the continued arrests of people who have refused to perform military service for ideological reasons of conscience.

&gt; At least three such arrests have been known since the beginning of 2014 , more than 6 known arrests five objectors in 2013 (one of them was arrested 2 times ) .

&gt; At the same time the Greek military courts continue to condemn conscience because of their refusal to perform military service . One of those arrested in 2013 , Michael Tolis , total denier who refuses military service for ideological reasons serving both mandatory military service and the punitive alternative , recently sentenced to 8 months imprisonment with one year suspended. Called also pay 200 euros for costs and expenses .

&gt; Another conscientious objector , 47 years old , and therefore not liable to military service now , John Glarnetatzis , just not too long ago discovered that on September 19, 2013 he was convicted in absentia for insubordination . The Glarnetatzis told Amnesty International that he learned that he had been sentenced to one year in prison with two years suspended , only when he received a notice from the IRS that asking him to pay 200 euros for costs and expenses . The notice of the proceedings was sent to an old address , despite the fact that he had declared his current address to trial another conscientious objector , earlier in 2013 .

There is a chorus of criticism at Germany's policies coming from virtually every country in the EZ, and UK media like the Telegraph, The Economist, and The Financial Times criticize Germany regularly. If you think it just comes from the US, you are imagining things. And I doubt you ""always like to hear both sides"", since I have never seen you once even acknowledge any credence in any arguments that suggest Germany is benefiting from the euro at the expense of other countries. It's always deflection, and you reflexively dismiss anything the US says with respect to the EZ's monetary policy.

If Germany is fucked, Europe is fucked. And if Europe is fucked, the US is fucked. It's in everybody interest to keep Germany's economy healthy. So what is your fucking problem? Hating on us for being EU's powerhouse? Don't hate the player, hate the game.

&gt; ""Where the Fourth Republic welcomed the United States because it provided security for Western Europeans, de Gaulle thought the United States was exploiting its excess of power.

&gt; In his mind the United States had been an imperialist force since the war and cloaked its expansionism in the guise of an altruistic crusade for freedom. Washington, in his view, wanted to retain the bipolar status quo because it guaranteed American hegemony and turned Europeans into dependents.

&gt; For this reason Washington did not want to share decision making, especially over nuclear strategy, with France. The force de frappe, or French nuclear strike force, threatened American control over deterrence. The Gaullist grand design would, if implemented, fundamentally alter the status quo—especially with respect to Western defense, European unification, and East-West relations.""

&gt; If the substance of policy differed, so did the style. De Gaulle more openly challenged the United States. His assertive and seemingly arrogant diplomacy contrasted with the more manipulative and conciliatory demeanor of the Fourth Republic. He demanded rather than negotiated and, when blocked, resorted to obstructionism. He patronized American leaders and publicly criticized American policy.

Yes, of course this is true. However, you could flip this around and say ""If Europe is fucked, then Germany is fucked"". You're right that it is in everybody's interest to keep Germany's economy healthy, but as you say ""that isn't the end of all things"". Germany isn't the only country in the EZ, and you make it seem as if every country in the EZ exists to fuel the engine of Germany's economy. It's far more likely that the EZ will implode (not saying it will, I mean *if* it will) due to the situation in the periphery countries, not Germany itself. 

I am not suggesting that Germany's policies are the source of the problem, but I (and just about everyone outside of Germany) am suggesting its policies are *exacerbating* the problem. Your attitude seems consistent with the attitude of many German's, and the German government itself. You may be uncomfortable with this idea, but here is a truth: Germany, as the leading economy in the EZ, and the leading voice on the EZ/ECB's policies, will be blamed for anything that goes wrong with the euro and the economies of various nations in the EZ. Your country is the captain of this ship, and if it runs aground, people will be blaming your country, fair or not. So it is not in Germany's best interest to dismiss the complaints of the other country's in the EZ. 

It seems Germany is very reluctant with its leadership role in Europe. The Economist accurately described Germany as the ""reluctant hegemon"" for a good reason. But unfortunately, your country does not have the luxury of sitting on the sidelines doing nothing and hoping the crisis in the eurozone will go away with a little dash of growth here and some austerity there. Germany must take decisive action in radically reforming the EZ. You cannot simply dismiss criticism of your country as unfair, unwarranted, or unwelcome. Your country is in a leadership role, this criticism comes with the territory whether you like it or not. If Germany continues to do nothing, and the situation continues to deteriorate, your country will be blamed. So it is not my ""fucking problem"", it's yours.",0,1400171391,null,0,false,0,chipxp7,t3_25kquv,t1_chipxp7,t1_chip6fx,null,1433809267,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Another was that they were actively planning on supplanting him in France with other leaders, or at the least preventing him from gaining power, but relented when they got scared of Communists.

He held that grudge pretty consistently. He saw the UK as a force that would eventually split the Community and as an American puppet. Whether he was right or not in thinking that? Well, look at the past few decades and you tell me.

These numbers are the ratio of Federal spending each US state gets in relation to the amount of Federal taxes it pays. These numbers are relatively constant year over year. Yearly, there is a *very* substantial wealth distribution from wealthy, urban states to poor rural states. This is even more acute with lower income territories like Puerto Rico, where Federal inflows make up 20-25% of their GDP. This helps smooth over discrepancies that would otherwise exist when a monetary policy that worked in New York might not be the best monetary policy for Mississippi or Puerto Rico. 

Keep in mind, federal tax in the US is the largest tax burden for both individuals and companies. So this transfer is not a small or obscure tax. 

There is no mechanism like this in the Eurozone to smooth over discrepancies between monetary policy and fiscal policy. The current Euro situation forces low income countries with stagnant economies to be stuck with monetary policy that has mostly been appropriate for high income countries with expanding economies and there are no fiscal transfers to counter this. To bail out Greece it took months of tense negotiations, some tears from the world's most stoic leaders, and inflaming the public on both sides of the borders.

La France a des relations commerciales avec l'Iran et la Russie, ça ne plait pas aux US. 

&gt;Pourquoi tu passe ton temps a parler de menaces, de conflits, d'adversaires, de protectionnisme et de guerre ?

Citation de François Mitterrand, pourtant un bon allié des américains (le meilleur selon Kissinger...) :

*La France ne le sait pas, mais nous sommes en guerre avec l’Amérique.*

*Oui, une guerre permanente, une guerre vitale, une guerre économique, une guerre sans mort …apparemment.*

*Oui, ils sont très durs les américains, ils sont voraces, ils veulent un pouvoir sans partage sur le monde…*

*C’est une guerre inconnue, une guerre permanente, sans mort apparemment et pourtant une guerre à mort !*

Im Uebrigen ist es Muslimen unter gewissen Umstaenden erlaubt andersglaeubige Frauen zu heiraten.

Jemand, den ich kenne, der muslimisch aufgewachsen ist, sich selber aber als Atheist bezeichnet, hat es mir vor einiger Zeit mal so erklärt: 

Das Geschlecht des Mannes bestimmt die Religion des Kindes. Das Kind eines muslimischen Mannes und einer christlichen Frau ist automatisch muslimisch, während das Kind eines christlichen Mannes und einer muslimischen Frau de facto christlich wäre, was ein böses No-Go darstellt, was auch erklärt, warum viele eher konservative Familien, ein großes Problem damit haben, wenn ihre Tochter mit einem Andersgläubigen zusammen ist. Andersherum ist es natürlich kein Problem, da ja, wie gesagt, die Religion des Mannes das Geschlecht eines Kindes bestimmt und weshalb es egal ist, welcher Religion die Ehefrau / Freundin angehört. 

Deshalb ist es auch egal, ob sich diese Frau als Christin sieht, da bereits bei ihrer Geburt festgelegt wurde, dass sie eine Muslimin ist. Wenn wir uns auf die Religionsfreiheit berufen, dann hat sie durchaus den Strang verdient.  /s

The problem is export hubs in the US/Canada and import hubs in Europe dont exist for those volumes. They're both extremely expensive, so they're not often built for emergency use only. Europe would have to make serious efforts to diversify away from Russia, which includes a large up-front investment. 

With liquification and shipping, US gas is roughly $1 more expensive than Russia's (~7%). Medvidev said he sees these ""fundamentals continuing"" while acting as a Gazprom executive, aka Russia will always make sure it will undercut North American gas. 

So long story short, the gas exists, but export hubs, ships, and import hubs are very expensive. The US and Canada are not going to invest billions in export capability for a rainy day when Russia cuts off gas.

""Imagine a world with computers about a million times faster, so small we can have them in our pockets, with flat displays with pixels so small they're indistinguishable, and where common and cheap connections are faster than 10mbits""  
""Cool""  

That's it. Because 2014 is a faster, cheaper, improved version of 1984. An intelligent person in 1984 can imagine a close version 2014 with these informations.   

Now try to explain telephone and the changes in the world to someone 30 before its invention. Steam engine locomotives. Electricity. Planes (even inventors will try to persuade you it's impossible and name you insane).

The law that made it mandatory to save receipts was abrogated 11 years ago. You are not legally required to save receipts, although you might want to for items that might need to be returned or that are covered by a manufacturer's guarantee (you'll need the original receipt of purchase in both cases).

As for transport tickets, it depends on which type you have. Tickets that are valid for a fixed time after you start using them (e.g. hourly tickets, weekly passes) need to be validated when you start using them; tickets that have a fixed starting date and hour (e.g. train tickets booked in advance) don't need to be validated. Also, tickets you get on board are auto-validated by the ticket machine so you don't need to. In case of doubt, locals will most likely be able to elucidate.

For 3 days around Bologna I suggest getting a City Pass; it's a 10 tickets voucher which saves you about 3€ over buying 10 separate tickets and, most importantly, saves you from actually having to deal with ten separate physical tickets. Each time you validate it you can travel for the following 75 min on any combination of urban busses and urban train lines (you don't need to re-validate if you switch busses, only if the 75 min run out).

&gt;Ottoman military bands are thought to be the oldest variety of military marching band in the world, dating from the 13th century.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"I'll give you the Tsipras tl;dr:

* Unemployment is structural, it won't go away with austerity. Europe found trillions to help bankrupt banks but only found a couple of billion to help fight youth unemployment. We need a New Deal for Europe to create jobs.
* The ideas Guy mentioned are what created this crisis and also the crisis in 1929. We need to overcome the paranoia of debt and fiscal discipline. Instead, we should have a debt conference to cancel debts, like the London Debt Agreement of 1953.
* I'm shocked that Guy supports bail-ins. We had the taxpayer at first to take on bank losses and debts with all the bailouts. Now they suggest that it is depositors that should take on bank debts and losses. I wonder if Martin and Jean-Claude also are in favour of this. 
* Joker: I agree that there is a huge corruption problem between Greek banks, both private and public, and Greek political parties. The problem in Greece might have been fiscal at first, but the supposed cure made things worse and now the problem is not about fiscal discipline any more.
* Euroscepticism is caused by the proponents of austerity that pretend that there is no alternative. In response to people wanting to dismantle the union we should create a new Europe that redistributes wealth instead of pain. 
* There is a tendency to create a Cold War-esque situation. We need diplomacy. We need to make sure no nazis are allowed in the Ukrainian parliament. We must make sure that neither NATO nor Russia are allowed to have a military intervention in Ukraine.
* The European Left respects the right to self-determination. But nationalism never leads to a positive results. We are against changing the borders of Europe while we want for the people to choose their own destiny. There should be more autonomy within countries, perhaps by switching to a federal structure.
* It is an oxymoron to talk about combating immigration when at the same time our countries are contributing to the conflicts that force people to leave their homes and seek refuge in Europe. It is disgrace that our seas are turning into a graveyard. We should renegotiate the Dublin II treaty and create a policy with a common budget on immigration in order to redistribute the weight of addressing the problem. 
* All countries should give the freedom to their citizens to have their cultural traditions. Therefore, people should be allowed to practice their religion and believe in whatever they want. Policies like the ones in Spain against abortions are anachronistic and remind me of the Franco regime. 
* The biggest problem in Europe now is the democratic deficit. We talk about the elections but the decisions end up being made by Mrs. Merkel. What does Mr. Juncker have to say about the fact that two democratically elected governments, in Greece and Italy, were overthrown to install technocrats?
* Corruption is a structural problem, especially in the South, we must admit. There should be legislation on the European level to fight tax evasion, offshore accounts and other such forms of corruption. It's an issue of political will because there are huge economic interests that we have to fight against.

There is a clear divide between streets where turks live and where white people live. Not just in style of house but also decorations (satellite dishes everywhere) and who walks on the street. With the turks there are always kids on the street harassing everyone passing through. If you talk back they'll call their older brother who will show up with his gangster friends to shank you. 

They steal everything of value, beat up old people, vandalize pretty much everything not attached to someone's property (that's why their streets look worse.) and they segregate themselves from anyone not also a turk. Unless you happen to be the only white kid in their street but that kid will turn out to be a white version of the turks. They stereotype the fuck out of themselves by doing all of the above and dressing all the same. They suck in school regardless if they want to succeed or not because their parents don't know how to raise them properly. How do we all know this? Because their streets are still filled with those kids by 22:30. They have no guidance or instructions except for ""Go outside."" 

My personal experience with them? Some faggots on a motorscooter (those things that go 40kmh max) threw a milkshake in my face for no fucking reason. They drove by while going 40 and threw it in my face while I was cycling in the opposite direction. 

One tried to mug me once, I could only run because I knew his friends would be around the corner waiting in case I would retaliate. I ran and indeed, there they were.

Lot's of fighting between the turkish kids and white kids in schools. They don't make friends with white people. Ever.

In the past 100 years the main migration was Serbs moving into the area, so it was these people that should've been integrated into the existing population, which of course they weren't. There was some effort done during communism, for example when I started elementary school there were still Serb classes that learned Hungarian, but when the war started these were abolished. 

Expecting the Hungarian population, which is native to this area and was already on friendly terms with the existing Serb population, to adapt again to the newcomers while the newcomers don't have to do anything, has not achieved anything but angered the communities, which you can see in incidents in Temerin etc. Or that case in Subotica where kids talk to each other in English because they don't speak Serbian/Hungarian. And people aren't shocked about how divided the communities are, they are shocked by how Hungarians don't speak the ""state language"". You cannot *demand* a people to learn a language without showing some respect back.

A better example is South Slovakia where everyone is dual lingual and Slovaks speak Hungarian just as well. This is why the Hungarians there aren't asking for autonomy.",0,1400183463,null,0,false,0,chivynk,t3_25m44r,t1_chivynk,t1_chiunv5,null,1433812173,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,delenda_east,null,null,"&gt; Western Europe was always going to participate with the USA and forge alliances with one another, in opposition to the Warsaw Pact and Soviet Union. US and Western European interests were just too closely aligned for an alliance not to have taken place. With such forgone conclusions, I've never seen the point in resisting them. Why not accept it earlier on and get in on potentially better terms?

The Suez Crisis showed that this was not the case. The US limited help during the Falklands should have reinforced that, as should have their reaction to British currency crisis in the '70s as well as their unilateral removal of Breton Woods. The UK has always sided with the US to it's detriment.

And it was deGauls fear that the US would treat Europe as a giant battleground and buffer, a set of client states to throw at the soviets as needed. Their support of facist elements such as Gladio showed as much. Simply put a united Europe was and still is absolutely necessary to prevent abuses of the major powers.

About your second point, I would like to share your optimism about the possibility of UK being more integrationist. But the fact is that the UK thought it won the war, and this has made its attitude to international relations significantly different. This is where some of the calls of ""empire nostalgia"" comes in and it has it's roots in the UK's post-war sense of security and achievement. The UK has a view of sovereignty that the losers of WW2 simply do not have anymore, still believed in balance of power politics of Westphalian states which again the loosers of WW2 could not afford to humour, and most damming they started believing their relationship with the USA as one of equals. This perception of the UK as a genuine global player and its isolation from the destruction on the continent has made it unwilling to make the sort of concessions which the continental powers were able to do. It's creation of EFTA before trying to joining what became the more successful EEC shows this reluctance.

Ohter human rights. When this is misused, sets a precedent  or goes too far you've created the ability to go against one human right because an other might be harmed and in regards to your example a regardless of who does it, a 30 or a 13 year old. Someone putting his own words on the internet has nothing to do with privacy.

&gt;But should a 13-year old boy that want to be edgy by saying a stupid racist joke on-line be faced with that when he applies for a job five years later?

Just about every site that makes you clearly identifiable allows you the option to remove your statements. Even most that don't like Reddit allows you to do so and that's the way it should be.

And how often does this happen anyway considering what the internet is and that kids age. Besides anyone can go online and post shit. There's a Canadian with the exact same name as me and he likes jazz music. He could be posting gore on his social media for all I know.

and besides, if you're going to apply this to those you consider not really accountable for their own mistakes ie kids then consider why they're allowed to do that anyway. Their parents are giving them unrestricted access to the internet in ways that can according to you harm their future then what stops them from bumping into cp, chatting with paedophiles or watching snuff films. Seriously, tell me.

Actions have consequences for every human being and you'll have to live with that.
That same kid with his right to life can run from behind a car across a dangerous road in front of a truck and die. Yet we're not suing that truck driver because that kid was a stupid kid or because his parents didn't keep an eye on him and to do so would be ridiculous.

In the end that right to privacy for them is still there. If I post crap on facebook i should be able to remove that or my account. Same with my albums on imgur and so on. I wouldn't think of going after google or yahoo because of that though. 


And what with info that gets spread around. A youtube hit or shitty song someone made as a kid. He/she can be embarrassed as fuck but what are you gonna do?

&gt; J'ai vu un film qui se passe en arabie saoudite et la pauvre petite elle a pas le droit de faire de vélo simplement parce que c'est une fille

Cool, poste un avis sur ce film. Sérieusement. Poste un lien vers la bande annonce. Pose des questions, propose un débat, donne-nous le titre du film… C'est vrai que la pratique du vélo varie en fonction du sexe (un reportage récemment posté en parle, et parle de la bicyclette comme moyen de libération des femmes au début du siècle), il y a récemment eu des articles (http://www.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2014/04/there-such-thing-feminine-way-ride-bike/8886/) et on en a parlé dans /r/bikecommuting (http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/25gkcp/is_there_such_a_thing_as_a_masculine_way_to_ride/) c'est un sujet intéressant, et peut-être que l'expérience est différente pour les cyclistes français-e-s. Bonne idée. N'hésite pas à partager. Rien que le titre du film ! C'est sûrement beaucoup plus porteur qu'un lien vers une trotinette de course ou une vidéo virale où il y a, quelque part, un vélo.

Là, tu as reposté une vidéo dont on avait, pour certains, déjà vu mention plusieurs fois. Ça ne démarrait pas de débat, et la façon dont tu l'as titrée n'attirait pas spécialement l'attention sur un rapport avec le vélo. Pourquoi ne pas avoir dit ""moi aussi je me suis fait courser par un chien une fois quand j'étais à vélo, cette vidéo m'a choqué"" ou quelquechose comme ça ? On aurait vu le rapport, et on aurait même pu en discuter directement ! Et ça aurait été sans doute un peu mieux.

Just thought I'd say this is incredibly unlikely. It's uncertain that they will even be the largest party in the European elections in the UK in 2014. UKIP and Labour are neck and neck with about 28% to 30% each (depending on which pollster you ask). Even if UKIP does become the largest party in the European elections, that's still with only 30% of the vote. They'd need to mobilise the other 20% and then some for a majority to be voting UKIP. It's quite something that 30% might vote UKIP, but let's hold our horses. It's shocking, but let's keep a firm handle on what the situation actually is.

The same logic as doxxing rules here. If a user here gives his information out somewhere on the internet, you're still not allowed to post his real name in a ""google friendly"" format (see Unidan, for instance). The logic is that if someone really needs some information on someone, and is really motivated to find everything out, you can still find it (and so can the courts, for instance); but otherwise a citizen can expect a small manner of privacy and power over his own information in that he can choose what is easily accessible and what not.


Keep in mind that this ruling does not apply to 'pertinent' information, only 'embarrassments'; hence a citizen could, for instance, have a drunk picture of themselves removed from google images - but a doctor couldn't remove all references to a prior conviction of malpractice.

And that's what high courts are for. Here the highest court in Europe decided that the human right to privacy is paramount to the human right to information (which, to be clear, isn't defined as a human right in any country in the world and by no organization or declaration ever in history).

I refer you to [the European Charter of Fundamental Rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union#The_text). You'll notice the right to privacy and protection of personal data is in there, but not a right to 'information' (however you would define that).

And there's good reason for that. History has shown time and time again that protection of the individual rights is always paramount to the protection of 'societal' values. Because when individuals lose their rights, or are easily stripped from their rights, it's very easy for nefarious people to rise to the top and strip all human rights from citizens. See for reference: any dictatorial takeover of a (semi-)democracy ever.

&gt; Actions have consequences for every human being and you'll have to live with that.

Not if lives can be infinitely improved by a simple removal of a search index link. Juveniles have, for instance, the right to have their record expunged upon reaching maturity everywhere in the world. A convicted criminal, who has done his time, has the right to ask for his record to be expunged (note that this isn't always granted).

Do you really think it's fair that those kind of protections exist, but I wouldn't have the right to, for instance, remove a search index link to, for instance, a ten-year old picture of me puking my guts out because of alcohol? And why not? Because I have to 'live with the consequences'? For who? Who would that benefit?

true,SpanishNinjitsu,null,null,"OK, the debate is over and it seems there won't be a new thread like the last time, so here are some of my impressions!

* The previous one was much, much more enjoyable. I understand the time limits in order to better fit the five candidates and keep the debate dynamic, but yeah, the end result wasn't as fun. If some of you guys reading this haven't watched that one, do so, especially if you're considering voting for Schulz or Verhofstadt, they really shine there.

* I think Verhofstadt was better than Schulz today, if I were to point a ""winner"", it would be him. Great speeches, lots of energy, in some points he even threw the ball back at Tsipras and lectured Keller (not cool, Guy, but effective nonetheless).

* Schulz was Schulz. He went ahead and joked about he being the next president. I think he was right. Juncker was a no show again so his only ""competition"" was Verhofstadt. He had no need to go out of his way to deliver a great speech but still managed to get several rounds of applauses. He dodged the Scotland/Catalonia question a bit, but big kudos for his full-front response on religious symbols.

* Keller was great. Many of us here complained about her not having enough bite and she delivered. She really stepped up her game from the previous debate and in some moments she truly was a force to be reckoned with (one of the reasons she got so attention from Verhofstadt this time, I think).

* I know who Tsipras is. I understand how important he is to the European left and how Syriza brought hope to not only the Greek left, but to also all the south European leftist movements. With that out of the way: who decided it was a good idea to let the guy speak in Greek!? Verhofstadt slapped him a few times, Schulz kind of ignored him and Keller got many applauses that should've been his. Terrible move by the European Left.

* I'm not going to say anything bad about Juncker because this guy is probably going to get half the votes for Commission President no matter what, but... he really didn't want to be there. He didn't want to be there at all. I still applaud him for being more progressive than many of the members of his party, though.",0,1400190668,null,0,false,0,chizilo,t3_25n20t,t1_chizilo,t3_25n20t,null,1433813847,17,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,17

With the addition of Dutch for Verhofstadt and Spanish (and little efforts at Greek and Irish) for Schulz. The point isn't who can speak more languages.

Russia instead would install a strongman like Kadyrov who'd deploy death squads and paramilitaries (fight asymmetric warfare with asymmetric warfare).

Combined with technological advances and Russian disregard for civilian casualties, the Afghan resistance would eventually just break because they're all dead.

Basically, the central problem with the Soviet-Afghan war was the weakness of the Afghan regime the Soviets installed and the Afghan regime's army.  Modern Russia would make sure Afghans kill as many Afghans as possible.

The green parties and EFA( partis verts et alliance libre européenne) are quite fervent supporters of a federal europe too. They are mainly left parties, with a clear stand for an europe based on cultural regions rather than current countries. The parties of this group are : EELV, Unser Land (Alsace), Union démocratique bretonne (Bretagne), Partitu di a Nazione Corsa (Corse), Partit occitan (Occitanie),  Unitat Catalana (Catalogne), Mouvement Région Savoie (Savoie) and Eusko Alkartasuna (Pays Basque) (I hope I have forgotten none).    

Now, many parties other than those are proponents of a deeper integration.

I think Clegg was attempting to have broad ranging appeal for the European project. He was trying to demonstrate to even hardline UKIPers that UKIP's position was not necessarily correct. He tried to fight Farage on his own turf and unsurprisingly didn't do that well. 

But what he has done will be very important as the debate on Europe evolves. Hardliners have been exposed to the potential fragility of their views in a much more direct way than in previous years. In future the debate will (I hope) naturally trend towards some of the other pro-European arguments, that I believe to be much more effective. The thing about the persuasive pro-EU arguments, however, is that they require a common starting point. For instance, it is hard to understand why ""foreigners"" should have the right to come to the UK if you do not first been introduced to Cosmopolitanism or something of the innerworkings of the EU. The EU is necessarily very complex and will require a lot more ideas to become common to a lot more of the electorate before further arguments can hold sway. An education of the basic principles must be heard out, followed by further stages and at the end the true benefit of the EU will be apparent. So Clegg's performance, whilst not particularly good, was not quite as bad as the exit polls would suggest.

I think it's just basic math. The people you exonarate for sure are going to be far less than the innocent in jail.

It serves no purpose and it tortures innocents for no reason. Jails should rehabilitate, dissuade citizens from committing crimes and be humane.

This requires some innocents being fucked by the system, sure, but it also requires we be tough on jail rape.

&gt; Currently there are about 65 000 prisoners in Italy. Those cases are since 1969. A minimum of people prison since then, and it is at least the double, is 100 000 prisoners.

Scotland can indefinitely delay its secession until it's sorted out some deal that avoids a customs/immigration barrier with England, and squared this with all the countries that have a grudge against the UK (Spain, Cyprus) or secessionism (anywhere that's mates with Serbia), and the people or opposition parties of France, but the UK will be completely and utterly banjaxed.

I'd assume it must be because of the ongoing EU elections. Perhaps people are finding out a bit more about the EU or are being swayed by the arguments of the ""in"" camp. 

UKIP have really forced the issue and the election campaign has become a public debate about membership as much as a competition for seats.

Second: 
&gt;  Since the court began operating in July 2002, it has mostly steered clear of investigations that would entangle it directly with the most powerful states. It hasn't touched the Russia-Georgia conflict or the situation in Palestine.


The ICC is primarily an European project and if Europe decides to go after the US for Afghanistan over China for arguably much more brutal tactics in Tibet/Uighurs, Israel over significantly more brutal tactics in Palestinian territories or Russia for insanely brutal tactics in Daegestan, Chechnya and Georgia then this will be extremely harmful to the US European relationship. If Europe goes down this road and damages the US, especially during a time like this then it should be prepared for massive fallout.

It's funny that once Europeans get Obama, a leader who for all his faults is much more in tune with European expectations, is the time the EU goes after the US. The Snowden inquiry and now the ICC investigation which are infinitely more damaging to US strategic interests than inflicting sanctions against a small cadre of Russian officials in Crimea and Russia for invading another European country and annexing their territory.  China threatens economic penalties and Europe doesn't make a peep. Don't think the message you are sending the next US administration will be lost on them.

Just to get that of the way, I was appalled at how the EU, and French politicians in particular decided that they didn't want Turkey in the EU without objective reasons or without honest ones. 

The only good reason I can think of is that this Cyprus thing needs to be solved first. We can't have two countries in the EU that are at war with each other.

true,CopernicuSagaNeilDT,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; The US would sell Taiwan out to China...

I think we would really have to 'wait and see' for this result.  As much as the world stage has been changing and as much as it looks like it will at the increasing rate it is, especially given the US current behavior, I think that an accurate prediction on this is damn-near impossible.  I think that if it came to it, the US would ignore Chinese aggression toward Taiwan, but give it a week or two.

&gt; This may not be as big of an issue for China as you may think.

I think you make a real valid point.  Have you seen the [empty cities they've been building?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3XfpYxHKCo)  They aren't all from some previous economic boom, but some I think are just to keep people at work.

&gt; The problem is though that it will take years to build up the factories

Again, I say that with the rust belt (which is rotting and may as well just be empty fields) there are other more recent factories.  A lot of machines that go into manufacturing, both high and low tech, are built in the US still.  That is not to say that it would be flipping a switch; it would not.  It would take time, but in many areas in the US the infrastructure is there and the facilities are there, it just needs to be resuscitated with labor force and finances.  Again, when I say, ""just"", I don't mean a light switch; we are talking years of reconstruction, but that in itself will be an economic stimulant.

&gt; I have observed that over the last decade or so

I had a European roommate that pointed this out to me.  I thought it was rubbish, when he first said it, but it is getting scary.  I mean that honestly.  The idea that everything is for 'the veterans' and that every single person in uniform is a died in the wool hero and that every one is constantly risking their lives for freedom and liberty and American unborn, baby fetus Jesus and... The indoctrination is disturbing.  Do you know how much of unnecessary stuff is clad in American flags?  Every McDonald's has at least one.


&gt; It seems almost as if the Anglosphere never left WWII

You are very close here, but what the overwhelming majority of people from outside the US don't seem to realize is that the overwhelming majority of Americans 'know for a fact' that the US of A won the second world war.  Not that the US contributed to the allied war effort and was on the victorious side, but that the US won the war for the allies and the 'ungrateful people of Europe would be speaking German if not for us'.  This is actually the view.  Most Americans don't even know that 1/3 dead during the war were from the USSR or that the US lost barely more than 400,000
while Germany lost 10,000,000+, the USSR lost ~27,000,000, or that Poland lost 3,000,000.  Most of them think WWII started when Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941 and don't think that Operation Barbarossa in 1939 counts.  It's really sad.

&gt; all the while there is a lot of chest thumping going on on how this could never happen here

See the discussion on indoctrination, above...

&gt; Yeah I am aware of these things, but my impression is that although most people secretly think that way, the public narrative is a different one

Americans love the idea of the 'rugged individual'.  The Libertarian Party in the US is the primary push behind this, these days.  Many think that, ""If they'd just get a job..."", ignoring all the intrinsic factors in classism, racism, sexism, etc and economically depressed areas, ""... then they would be better off.  They haven't *earned* what *I*have earned.""  It's disgusting, frankly, but I don't totally disagree with you, here.

&gt; They seem to be more interested in taking out the internal opposition than to have a united country

Oh, it's about unity.  They want to eliminate the internal opposition, so that they can unite the power of the nation for themselves over the opposition.  Much like symbols in the past, the Tea Party, et al, have taken a great symbol of cross-culture, cross-border unity, [The Gadsden Flag](http://blog.cvsflags.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Gadsden-Flag-for-contest.gif), which originally was more like [this](http://www.loeser.us/flags/images/protest/join%20or%20die%20flag.gif) - an image to unite the states under the federal government - and turned it into the opposite of its meaning in some sick, hypocritical, Orwellian double-speak.  It is a Federalist symbol, used to unite a people against an external threat, that is now used as a wedge for bigots to utilize the 'Southern Strategy' and continue to divide the proletariat against itself.

&gt; The question for the last decade for me always was who the US will take with them as they exit the stage left.

As many as possible.  The fall of the US will bring havoc.  The US may be (have been?) a rather ruthless hegemony, but it was stable.  What replaces it could be better, but it could be much worse.

It's hard to read, especially to those who've never learnt it (i.e. the rest of the world), which would make communication with anyone who doesn't use it a pain in the arse – just like it makes life easier when everyone uses a common measurement system (metric). Think about how absurd it would be if German speakers still used Fraktur in this day and age. Imagine Facebook in Fraktur. Imagine your phone's operating system in Fraktur.

But not only is Fraktur hard to read, it's also hard to write. Antiqua is far more robust; Fraktur needs to be handled with a lot of care. To give you an example, italics don't work in Fraktur, instead a common method of emphasis was to increase letter spacing – except where it would break up ligatures (like ﬁ or ſch). This kind of emphasis has a far stronger effect than italics, because it changes the ""colour"" of the emphasised words, which italics doesn't. Another issue is the letter ſ (long s) with its obscure rules as to when it appears and its confusing similarity to f. This is a somewhat independent problem; ſ was used in Antiqua until around the late 18th century, so one could have reformed Fraktur in similar fashion, but it illustrates that producing a text in Fraktur is a lot more effort than writing in Antiqua, which is at odds with our age in which individuals write more than ever before.",0,1400220204,null,0,false,0,chjbll7,t3_25m3xm,t1_chjbll7,t1_chj42ix,null,1433819678,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

Don't use taxis unless you really, *really* need them, and believe me, you don't; there are night buses that come often during the night (1 am-5 am) that will take you to wherever you stay.

&gt; **Mais si le roi est fou ?**

&gt;La président de la république Paul Deschanel n'était-il pas fou ? En mille ans de Monarchie, le cas s'est peut-être présenté avec Charles VI. En réalité, il était malade. De plus, un roi ne gouverne pas tout seul. Il a des conseillers, lesquels sont tenus par une institution. Même malade, la seule présence du roi assure la stabilité du pouvoir. C'est là un avantage de l'institution royale. Par contre, c'est sous la république de Weimar qu'Hitler a été élu. Et Danton, et Robespierre avec la Terreur et tous ses massacres.

&gt; **Mais le roi, c'est un tyran !**

&gt; Cela n'est jamais arrivé en 1300 ans de monarchie française, et il y a assez de barrières dans les institutions de la royauté pour rendre impossible un tel événement. Ce sont les républicains qui accusaient Louis XVI d'être un tyran, alors que celui-ci a même refusé de faire tirer sur les émeutiers qui enfonçaient ses portes ! Les révolutionnaires ont liquidé des centaines de milliers de personnes parce qu'elles n'étaient pas d'accord avec eux. Qui est le tyran ? De toute façon, il suffit de comparer :

&gt;* Guillaume II est-ce la même chose qu'Hitler ?
&gt;* Sihanouk est-ce même chose que Pol Pot ?
&gt;* Le Shah, est-ce même chose que Khomeyni ? -Louis XVI est-ce même chose que Robespierre ?
&gt;* Nicolas II, est-ce même chose que Staline ?

&gt;La république, elle, est plus que tyrannique, elle est totalitaire, sur les corps ou les âmes. Depuis les années 1880, elle enseigne aux élèves une histoire tronquée, falsifiée, trompeuse. Elle a endoctriné des générations entières, montrant une vision purement négative de la monarchie, et de nos jours, une image négative de la France, dans une sorte de masochisme abjecte.

Nearly every monarchy that survived in Europe was always a constitutional monarchy or became one. I mean in the UK the Magna Carta was signed in 1215.

This was the first time Putin has done this when there was any sort of serious opposition to him in Europe. In Georgia, Europe was only half invested in stopping the conflict. Not only that, but Crimea and Eastern Ukraine are cleaner victories, which makes for more intoxicating highs compared to the embarrassments during their Georgian adventure. And to top it off, they did it regardless of vehement European and American anger and opposition.

Now you have the candidates doing actual campaign, positioning themselves on relevant issues, engaging in debates watched by people across the EU.

They could've prepared short speeches in English covering the most obvious topics and have Alexis memorise them (Keller pretty much ran on prepared speeches and she did great).

100 million die quickly, or 80 million die slowly after being raped, shot at, run over by military hardware, summarily executed or put into labor camps. 

How do you quantify human suffering? Why do you think the survival of a nation state is more important than minimizing the suffering of it's population?

&gt; I'm saying it will take you years, a decade at least.

A decade? Ha... You are aware we do have delivery systems already ready? This might not be known in cozy France, but we were ready to become a nuclear battlefield on a second's notice in the later 20^th century. The idea was the US would let us participate in their arsenal - but I guess we didn't believe that either.

It would not surprise me if we had some quasi-assembled bomb casings somewhere with the physics package missing. 

&gt; What the fuck are you on about ? 

I am pointing out that conventional warfare is irrelevant, and NATO's full of shit. The only thing that will prevent Russia from invading *any* of us is the fear of getting a bad blow themselves, something conventional warfare just doesn't offer. 

Thus, we all need to have first- and second-strike capability - not to use it, but to show we're willing to use it. The fail-deadly system is just so some soft-washed westerner doesn't decide it ""isn't really necessary"" - because once one of them does so, the threat scenario is gone and everyone elses nukes are worthless.

And should we have to use them ... then better make sure the least amount of human suffering will come from it. Which of course means going for the 100% annihilation rate.",0,1400232803,null,0,1400232987,0,chje6km,t3_25oxvc,t1_chje6km,t1_chje2cp,null,1433820894,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Tu lo sai, sì, che dei tanti processi a Berlusconi e politici molte volte i verdetti sono stati di innocenza o archiviati, sì? Anche se il FQ o Santoro urlano il contrario, talvolta il PM toppa clamorosamente. Come per le tesi di accordo Stato-Mafia.

La logica bifolca, se vuoi così chiamare la logica del popolino, è esattamente quella che descrivi sotto, una sorta di linciaggio moderno, dove pochi capipopolo (Travaglio, Santoro, Grillo, ma anche *mutans mutantis* Sallusti, Feltri, Belpietro) possono decidere chi è colpevole e chi no, senza attesa della analisi giudiziaria, che non sempre è affine al sentimento popolare/forcaiolo, che attesta ai politici (come una volta ai preti) tutte le malefatte di questo mondo e affida a loro il compito di caprio espiatorio di *tutte le colpe*, come vedo nel tuo urlo qua sopra, dove affidi a Berlusconi la ""colpa"" della crisi.

We are currently seeing China expand its military capabilities massively, being aggressive towards all of its neighbours (except russia ofc) and pushing its agenda through the use of force.

La mia personale opinione è che il rischio maggiore sia la sovraesposizione non controllata.

Dal nostro punto di vista, una grossa mole di informazioni agevolmente disponibili è qualcosa di fantastico, ma nella mente in via di sviluppo credo che possa portare a degli effettivi ""svantaggi"".

Per riprendere il tuo esempio della ""piazza"", io immagino una grossa libreria incustodita.

Il bambino ci vaga dentro, e può capitare tranquillamente nella sezione educativa e godersi completamente capolavori adatti a lui.

Un altro bambino può finire nella sezione dei noir, dei libri per universitari, dei testi erotici, con differenti risultati a seconda delle sue tendenze e della sua capacità di analisi.

Il terzo bambino potrebbe finire a leggere il Mein Kampf senza nessuno che gli fornisca chiavi di lettura adatte.

Un altro rischio tremendo è la condivisione ""guilt free"" di foto, filmati, informazioni personali.
Basta vedere il nuovo fenomeno mediatico di Vine, con i suoi video popolari di 6 secondi.
Il primo periodo era letteralmente invaso di video di bambine che uploadavano video pornografici con loro stesse come protagoniste.

La peer pressure sui bambini è molto più forte, e l'idea di ricevere attenzioni dagli sconosciuti su internet in cambio di un paio di foto è decisamente allettante per loro.

Per fare un bel TL;DR - L'uso di internet da parte dei bambini andrebbe monitorato (anche in modo non invasivo, con controlli ""discreti"" dopo l'utilizzo) nel loro interesse.

Bisogna anche tenere presente che non si può monitorare niente con una precisione del 100% e che impedirgli l'accesso è dannoso e li attira a farlo di nascosto, lontani dal vostro controllo, per cui usate il cervello, state allerta e pregate il vostro santo di quartiere che vada tutto bene anche quando NON potete monitorare.",0,1400236589,null,0,1400245575,0,chjet3x,t3_25p952,t1_chjet3x,t3_25p952,null,1433821189,9,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,9

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platypus

&gt;There is no universally agreed plural of ""platypus"" in the English language. Scientists generally use ""platypuses"" or simply ""platypus"". Colloquially, the term ""platypi"" is also used for the plural, although this is technically incorrect and a form of pseudo-Latin;[6] the correct Greek plural would be ""platypodes""

So I tend to go with platypuses, or platypodes (see: octopodes), but not platypi.

I dont know where you got the notion that Russia has no allies at all, China is one of its biggest allies as well as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Belarus and Iran.

Pretty sure Russia couldn't just ""declare war and be done with it"" NATO has a sizable force in europe, also nuclear weapons.

I didnt say China has a desire to attack Europe, im using China as an example, look at what they are doing to there neighbours who have very small military budgets. Drilling in disputed waters, building air strips on disputed islands, military vessels violating air space, this is what Russia could potentially start to do to Europe (well it is already doing it to Ukraine).

I think that its the very fact that the US/NATO have such large expenditure on their military that has kept the world relatively stable for the last ~20 years.
