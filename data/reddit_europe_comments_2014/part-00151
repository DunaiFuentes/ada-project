OGM -&gt; più produttivo

La cosa non è così semplice...

&gt; However, these increases in productivity, impressive as they are, will probably have a limited impact on the global food supply because the products currently available on the market are suitable only for large mechanized farms practicing intensive agriculture. In fact, most of the transgenic crops that have been produced to date, especially by the private sector, are aimed either at reducing production costs in agricultural areas that already have high productivity levels or at increasing the value of the final product (e.g. improving the oil quality of seed crops). 

TLDR: sono più produttivi ma sono ottimizzati per le zone ad alta produttività  e industrializzate

Esempio: nel caso la soia GMO, il risultato più brillante è stato quello della soia round-up ready

( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_soybean )

Cosa è la soia RundUp-ready ? Una soia che resiste al diserbante Roundup. Ovvero, tu spruzzi i campi di diserbante, il resto delle piante crepa, la tua soia sopravvive.

Bingo! maggior produttività!

peccato che, ad esempio:

1) questo valga solo per i paesi industrializzati, che farebbero uso estensivo del roundup

ovvero, maggior produttività per chi ha soldi da investire, ma per gli altri?

2) anche ammesso che la soia roundup-ready sia innocua, se il suo scopo principale è quello di permettere di irrorare impunemente la soia di diserbante, non sarà meglio accettare produttività minori?

Amazing, since I have both worked in Sweden and know what your political scene is like. 

There's no simplification in the statements of your left, many of whom do not even recognize the notion of ethnic swedes, or in that of your social democratic leader saying those things.

If you are referring to my many comments about gypsies? Well once again I've never said it is a genetic thing. I've said that their culture seems to breed a form of behaviour. Culture and race are very much different things. I also said that at what point do we ask if it is ours or their fault that gypsies **seem** to be universally hated in all countries that have a gypsy population. I mean it is a valid question. It is an interesting question. Because there is no way to deny that gypsies tend to end up not being a particularly liked minority in the countries they have a ""significant"" population of gypsies.

Again, seems like you prefer to only discuss what you deem ethical enough to talk about. Any opinion that questions your world view is racist, xenophobic or pure evil. Opinions you deem to fall under your subjective categorisation of intolerance is an intolerant act by itself. You preach tolerance but you seem to be very intolerant yourself.

But no worries, you're not alone. There are many ""professionally-offended-people"" out there. It is nothing new. Well in fact it is, this whole political correctness movement is fairly new and the only way it's followers can protect it is to kick up a huge dust cloud of being offended or throw in a hitler car or two so that they can kill off any discussion aimed at questioning this whole phenomenon.",1,1401286895,null,0,1401290579,0,cht41zt,t3_26okel,t1_cht41zt,t1_cht3rr7,null,1433989163,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Yes, politicians often don't talk about ethnicity, because their job is to care for the Swedish population. There is no point in bringing ethnicity into a discussion on education, or the economy, or infrastructure... It's more common for politicians to speak of integration, and immigrants, and whatnot.

Yeah, some people in Sweden criticize our culture in an attempt to defend immigration. I'm no fan of it. It is true that a lot of aspects of our culture come from other countries.

The EU is vital for most if not all countries. The problem is that most Europeans don't know or realize that unless working in industries that rely heavily on regulated common market. The EU is not a project to turn Spain into Germany with better weather. The common market requires regulations in all areas of society, and if the EU with all its regulations and standards would disappear over night, many industries and countless companies would be in deep trouble and many million people would lose their jobs. It might be ""Great Depression"" all over again, and then we would see a real shift to right across Europe.

Now we are talking. Instead of whining about it just say it. I mean I can take it and so can anyone else that according to you have abhorrent opinions. Let it all out, it is going to make you feel so much better. I promise.

What comes to my children. Well they will be allowed to form their own opinion and I will teach them one important lesson that many seem to not understand. Never judge a person on their opinions. If you disagree take the debate. If you are too afraid to take the debate, then you are not secure in your own beliefs and should with even less reason judge anyone over it. They will also learn to respect freedom of speech and opinion. However incomprehensible it might sound for you, I'd be willing to die for your right to say what the hell you want. I doubt that you would be willing to do the same for anyone that doesn't agree with you.

&gt;Pre-judging people based on your subjective opinion that they are not-native.

Not native has nothing to do with race. Absolutely nothing. Racism also per definition means that you see people of another origin, race, ethnicity or whatever you may call it as worth less than you. I don't. I think that every person has the right to exist, and that every person has the right to have an opinion and that everyone is as much human as I am. But I do not think that Europe should be open for everyone, I do not think that all people are completely and identically equal in every possible way. Some are smarter, some richer, some poorer, some good at sport, some are bad at sports etc.

I also believe that some cultures foster behaviour not compatible with western society. But that is a cultural issue, not a race issue. If it so happens that everyone belonging to that culture is of the same race it still doesn't make it anything but a cultural issue.

&gt;Yes, I'm 'professionally offended' because I try and explain to a racist, xenophobic, sociopathic, bigot that their opinion is abhorrent.

On that I agree. I however think that there is a whole lot of deliberate conflation of the two terms in Swedish politics.

&gt;Yes, politicians often don't talk about ethnicity

They actually do talk quite a bit about ethnicity, just not the Swedish one. Identity politics about Roma, Kurds, Palestinians etc all come down to ethnicity.

&gt;The word ""etniskt svensk"" is not taboo, in fact it's politically correct. 

Oh come off it. Your DN and Aftonbladet starting going on about how worrying it is and ""fishing in murky waters"" it was that Reinfeldt used the term in some parliamentary debate.

&gt;I said that you sound racist. I didn't call you a racist. Based on what you've written to me, you seem racist. 

That's interesting. Which particular part of my post denote feelings of superiority or inferiority on part of a people group? 

&gt;The reason it makes you seem racist is because that's what racists do, they look into people's backgrounds to try and define them. 

So I take it the Left is racist when discussing the problems of Roma, Kurds, Palestinians et al in terms of their ethnic identity?

&gt;It's actually the first thing you wrote to me, you called me an outsider. 

Yes, under the presumption that you were of French origin and talking for the Swedish ethnic group while saying Bangladeshis were just as Swedish as they are.

&gt;Yeah, some people in Sweden criticize our culture in an attempt to defend immigration.

Criticize is putting it lightly. It's often outright denial of it's existence.

&gt;I'm no fan of it. It is true that a lot of aspects of our culture come from other countries. 

It's true of all people that haven't lived in total isolation, that doesn't mean it's not extremely bigoted to decry all native contributions to it.

&gt;If you understand Swedish I could send you the link. He's the leader of Sverigedemokraterna, btw.

I understand Swedish. I'm guessing it's the swedification is about Kebab pizza?

&gt;I haven't heard Löfven do that. I haven't heard Reinfeldt call our culture ""purely barbarian"", I seriously don't know what you're talking about.

The former Social democrat leader, the woman who sank their party to historic lows, I forget her name at the moment. For Reinfeldt he said something to the effect of ""The swedish culture is pure barbarism, all good [culture] came from outside"" I recall reading it and thinking it was insane for a country's leader to show such disgust for it's native people. 

&gt;It doesn't seem like you understand our language, since you don't call the parties M, S, etc. 

I understand it well enough, I fail to see why not refering to them by shorthands or their nicknames like ""Sossarna"" and ""Borgarna"" denotes ignorance.

You said that. I didn't. Per your definition of a loosely defined neo-racism your statement is racist.

Well stop moaning about it. There's a report function you can click on. Or does someone have to draw you a map?

So not only do you get offended for the sake of others, you also worry about how much work people can do? Man you really are such a nice person... well no I take that back, you're not nice, you are in fact very narrow minded and completely pointless to talk to.

Besides the rules you are referring to say this one:

&gt;Racism, as well as xenophobia, homophobia and other forms of bigotry will not be tolerated.

Are deeply worrying in a sub that is highly political as it is a subjective view on what falls under each ""category"". As we see here, what you see as racist I don't. What I see as bigotry you don't.

Your views to me feel very bigoted by the simple definition of the word bigoted:

true,KosherNazi,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; The US can setup secret black site CIA torture prisons in Lithuania, Poland and Romania with impunity.

Why is the US the only one that gets blamed for this?  We didn't invade Poland and demand somewhere to torture people.  We showed up with $15mn in cash and the Polish intelligence service said ""thanks buddy, use that building over there.""

The very article you linked to says this:
&gt; And in December, the European Court of Human Rights heard arguments that Poland violated international law and participated in torture by accommodating its American ally; a decision is expected this year.

&gt; “In the face of Polish and United States efforts to draw a veil over these abuses, the European Court of Human Rights now has an opportunity to break this conspiracy of silence and uphold the rule of law,” said Amrit Singh, a lawyer with the Open Society Justice Initiative, which petitioned the court on behalf of a detainee who was held at the Polish site.

How is that ""acting with impunity""?  You want to just deflect all blame onto the US because it's easier than facing Europes own problems.  That's the kind of blind nationalism and demagoguery that Europes far right thrives on, and sure as hell isn't going to result in stronger federalization.

&gt; They can take a German off the street, rape and torture him before realising he just had a similar name to a terrorist. When he then went to take his case to the EU courts the US stated it couldn't go further because it was classified.

The Macedonian authorities stopped him at the border, and took it upon themselves to offer him to the CIA.  It was then the American National Security Advisor who ordered his release in 2004, an American newspaper (NY Times) which broke the story in 2005, and an American civil rights organization (ACLU) which took up his cause in the court system.

The European Court of Human Rights also ruled [in favor](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/12/13/el-masri.html) of Masri, saying he was abused in Macedonian and US custody, and he was awarded 60k euros.

And oh, don't forget that Germany [knew about the abduction days after it happened](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/02/world/europe/02masri.html) and did nothing.

&gt; CIA agents can be convicted in Italian courts for crimes on Italian soil but the US would never extradite their CIA agents so beyond being convicted in absentia they've basically gotten away with kidnap

Are you kidding?  The very article you link mentions that Italy's intelligence service cooperated with the abduction and rendition, were convicted, and then had their convictions overturned due to Italian ""state secrecy laws"".  Of course they're going to save face by trying to deflect all the blame onto the Americans involved, it's the exact same thing you're doing in this post.  ""We're innocent, it was all the Americans fault!""

&gt; The US can use it's extradition laws to extradite a British student for violating copyright laws in the US that don't even exist in the UK. The US are so interested in defending copyright and hollywood

And by US laws, [you mean UK laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition_Act_2003), right?  You also failed to mention that he was [never actually extradited](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-20636626).

&gt; More subtle and less overt stuff like ensuring only American business operates at events like the London Olympics.

In what way is McDonalds bidding for an Olympic sponsorship and getting one of the [many monopolies sold to the highest bidder by the IOC](http://www.theguardian.com/sport/datablog/2012/jul/19/london-2012-olympic-sponsors-list) an American political machination?

&gt; The International Criminal Court will only ever be a tool used to prosecute poor African nations warlords. China, Russia and the US have been ignoring the ICC for a while now. The UN said a clear ""No"" to the Iraq invasion and the US ploughed ahead anyway.

Well, you got us there.  The UN said no to the Iraq invasion but England did kindly help us out with that anyway.

Sarcasm aside, the blowback in the US has been huge from that, the war was immensely unpopular, and we then elected a president who finally extricated us from Iraq after 10 years.

Let's not pretend that the UN was all halos either, I'm sure you remember the endless empty resolutions passed condemning Iraq's renewed military buildup, Iraq's launching SAMs at aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones, and the infamous [oil for food scandal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil-for-Food_Programme).

&gt; For example when the ICJ ruled in favour of Nicaragua in the 80's the US simply dismissed the International Court of Justice. You heard that right when the UN security council voted for the US to uphold International Law and compensate Nicaragua for crimes against humanity the US veto'd it. It's like a comedy sketch.

The ICJ didn't rule that the US committed crimes against humanity.  From your own link:

""There is no clear evidence that the United States actually exercised such a degree of control as to justify treating the contras as acting on its behalf... Having reached the above conclusion, the Court takes the view that the Contras remain responsible for their acts, in particular the alleged violations by them of humanitarian law. For the United States to be legally responsible, it would have to be proved that that State had effective control of the operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.""

Everything else you said is accurate, though.  But it's worth pointing out that this all culminated in one of the [largest political scandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran–Contra_affair) of the last 50 years, in which a US President ignored explicit US law and continued to fund the Contras. It stopped when the deception was revealed.

true,spammster,null,null,"you can get your tax number from the local tax office (Steueramt).

you don't actually have to get one before you work. you certainly can and it makes sense, if you do not have your number you will be classed in the highest tax bracket until you file your first taxes (where you will get a number automatically and a refund).

the process is pretty straight forward though.

1. figure out which tax office is responsible for you.

here is the list of Frankfurts tax offices:

http://www.finanzamt-frankfurt-am-main.de/irj/FA_Frankfurt_Internet?cid=65340d5d64d4e3f9d750f27a699efa3d

the whole process is rather simple though, just call the info line to figure out which one will be responsible for you (they need your address or zip code)

if your lucky they will accept a standard email from you asking for it, if not they make you fill out paperwork.

they will tell you which form you have to fill out (get your dictionary for that one, this shits confusing for a native) you can either fill this out at home (you can do it online) but i would suggest you get an appointment at the correct tax office and fill it out with them. just make sure you state that you are a foreigner, work visa etc. and that english would be preferred (or you might get someone who doesn't speak any english at all (unlikely but can happen) if you warn em in advance you'll get someone who speaks fluent english who will just ask you for the required info and fill it out for you.

once thats done sign it and wait about a month you'll get a letter that contains the number.

once you have that number give it to your employer and make them deal with it.

generally a good idea to make it a personal appointment as they will provide you with additional info concerning tax law especially with regards to foreigners.

you will also have to go to the local ""Bürgerservicecenter"" (Citizen service center) which is a nice way of saying ""abandon all hope ye who enter"".

you have to show up there with your visa and preferably a copy of your rental agreement, you need to do this within the first week of moving in there. basically you are required to register your address with them. it doesn't cost anything but it will take time, you will wait in a sad sad environment and eventually talk to someone who has stopped giving a fuck decades ago and now just waits for the sweet release of death.

bring plenty of time, if you want it to be done anytime soon be there 15 min before they open and run for the ticket machine.

little edit: 

i just looked at the form you will have to fill out, its a 1 page document that comes with a 5 page document explaining what you have to actually fill in the fields.

For the ""autorización inicial de residencia temporal no lucrativa,"" the Spanish government requires that you have 400% of the IPREM (Indicador Público de Renta de Efectos Múltiples) in a Spanish bank. You can see the details on the IPREM for 2014 here:

http://www.iprem.com.es

It looks like the annual IPREM this year is 6.390,13, so you would need  25,560 Euros. 

I do know that when you request your visa to enter Spain, that the consulate may ask you to show more money in your home country's bank. Once you're in Spain, you have month (or a bit more) to apply for residency, they won't ask you to show the higher amount ever again, they'll go by the IPREM.

Edited to add: They also only check in that one moment what you have in the bank by looking at your ""movimientos bancarios."" You can move money around after that.

Speak for yourself. There is a line, and the line we drew after WWII is intentional harm to human life in a non belligerent situation.

Or else we would even have the right of self-defense for private citizens, which we don't, as irrational as it may look.

Our constitutions consider unacceptable not to punish even somebody who killed in self-defense, if disproportionate force was used. Imagine what our fundamental values might say on those who would shoot to protect their ""property"".

If this basic human rights principle has escaped your personal fundamental values toolkit, it's your own personal problem. The very system you live in is tuned to reject such reactions. That's also why we don't have death penalty,and the US does.

&gt; And to be brutally honest I agree with the sentiment, maybe not killing them but I don't think we Europeans owe the rest of the world jack shit just because their own countries are a shambles

true,silent_strings,null,null,"&gt; It's fairly straightforward to work out: is the NHS being used more and being made to do more with less as a result of a bigger (and older) population, no matter whether that comes from migration or not?

This is the whole argument -- it's doing more with less, yes.  That's why standards are declining.  If the only factor was immigration it would be doing more with more.

&gt; An increase in labour (i.e. immigrants) increases the supply of workers. This means wages are going to go down.

Okay, this is true, neither of us is telling the whole story.  There are also those positions which there are simply not enough skilled and willing British people to fill.  As for those in unskilled positions, they can't go any lower than the minimum wage, and are never likely to go above it.

&gt; To suggest that an electorate of 40 years ago is the voice that we're going to continue to base our current dealings with the EU on is unfair ... It seems the obvious choice to let them decide again.

I agree with that in theory.  As a matter of practicality, based on the uninformed nature of most voters, I'd say the obvious choice is to move onto other arguments as much as possible and try to avoid a referendum at all costs.

&gt; You do realise only one country in the world, Upper Mongolia, isn't in at least one trade agreement. It is clearly not the case that the UK would become this little isolated island.

We'd still have trade agreements, sure.  But with what clout would we be negotiating them?  I was referring to natural resources in that we don't have anything that we don't rely on trade to bring in, in order for us to trade it back out.  I'm not saying anything would plummet, or that we'd be shut out; I'm saying that we're in decline, and we're not in a strong position to bring about and safeguard our own renaissance.  We won't plummet, we'll merely inexorably shrink, as trade slowly becomes less favourable to us, as we become less attractive in terms of anything but our tax loopholes.  We'll rely more and more heavily on the financial sector, until we're essentially a tax haven/casino, and the real economy (that felt by the man in the street) will be weaker and more unequal than ever.",0,1401291302,null,0,false,0,cht61cp,t3_26ksj3,t1_cht61cp,t1_chsyesf,null,1433990097,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Man får höra så sjukt ofta på nätet om hur våra politiker, och svenskar i allmänhet, hatar på den svenska kulturen, nekar att den ens existerar, hyllar utländska kulturer osv. Är man inte källkritisk och faktiskt kollar runt i svensk media så får man för sig att vår kultur är både avskydd och hotad av vänsterpolitiker som aktivt försöker ändra den. Jag ska vara ärlig, jag föll för det. Jag trodde verkligen på det. Tills att jag satte mig ner med min mor och pratade om det. Hon bad mig hitta exempel, och jag började leta runt på media, och tänka på exempel i samhället, då vi inte får prata fritt pga rädsla för att bli kallade för rasister, eller exempel där den svenska kulturen blir förnedrad. Jag hittade det inte! Några enstaka exempel på politiker som gör dumma uttalanden, men väldigt få. Absolut inte på någon märkvärdig skala. Sorry!

Here's what Reinfeldt said.

""Det kan ibland vara bra att ödmjukt påminna om att väldigt mycket av det som är Sverige har skapats i utveckling, just för att vi varit öppna för att ta emot andra människor och andra erfarenheter"", after explaining the meaning of ""ursvenskt är bara barbariet"".

You see, our immigration dates back from hundreds of years ago. We've had immigration for a very, very long time. Our country was indeed shaped from it. In fact, the mass immigration of wallonier is still spoken about today. Now they are Swedish. Will you accept them as Swedes? You seem to be picky. 

""Det ursvenska"" that does not mean ""the swedish culture"" it means that which originated from Sweden without any interference from other areas. But he didn't say that was barbaric! He said ""ursvenskt är bara barbariet"", only the barbary is Swedish without any interference from any area. If you'd take the time to study our history you'd find this to be true. Outside influence is what shaped Sweden. We didn't bring outside barbary in, we brought positive things in from the outside. This does not, however, mean that there are no problems with imimgration. 

I don't know what Sahlin said, so I can't help you there.

But yeah, please send me some denials of my culture existing. I'd like to know which politicians to avoid. 

I don't know what DN or Aftonbladet wrote about the word, but surely Reinfeldt using it is enough to convince you that it is a politically correct word. 

No, it's not the swedification of kebab pizza, it was comments on how kebab in Sweden is not like kebab elsewhere, as an easy example of how things immigrants bring become swedified. A common attitude in Sweden.

Again, I find that someone who will make me defend where I'm from so heavily sounds like a racist. It's just what racists do. I wrote to you that I'm Swedish, correcting you, and you wrote back that my father is French. Look, my father can be French, I'm still a Swede. Your obsession with ethnicity makes you seem like a racist, I don't know if you actually are because I'm not in your head. 

Anyway, putting ethnicity aside, I think you've completely misunderstood what being Swedish is. The truth is, we've had a lot of discussions on it in the media, it's been about defining it and the difficulties with defining it. Is a Swedish-Finn not Swedish? What of the krigsbarn? Wallonier? Do we draw a limit somewhere? What purpose can ethnicity serve? How do we define our ethnicity? Is a child adopted from Russia not Swedish? Can a second generation immigrant not be Swedish? 

It's about what WE, the Swedes, call Swedish. We have very honest and open debates about it. We haven't come to a conclusion. There probably is no conclusion. Please don't send me another wikipedia article, and try to see it from our perspective, and try to acknowledge that the swedish ethnicity is not so well-defined. 

But your attitude towards it is frightning to me. Yes, I'm not entirely Swedish. Yes, I'm scared when I see SDU say that the place I'm from, that my friends are from, regardless of the color of their skin, belongs to... ""oss""? Who is ""oss""? Can I be part of it? I'm of French origin. I'll make it even worse for you, my last name is Algerian, as my father was half French, half Algerian. My friend Ru is not white, like me, should she be scared? Is she going to be a Bengali in the eyes of politicians who grow ever more popular? Is Sweden not for her? Can she not be a part of ""oss""? 

I couldn't feel safe in my country if we're not all equals, if Sweden does not belong to all of us who are from there. If part of the population will be singled out and called foreigners (of course they would also be called foreigners in the country of their parents...) my country will not be the same.

I hope I made some sense. I'd also like to add an apology, I'm sure you're not a racist. I know it's a really nasty thing to be accused of.

For instance, the danish Morten Messerschmidt was elected on a platform of ""EU back on track"" (just that, with varying responses when asked to elaborate) and ""welfare protection clause"" (basically, he wants to protect the danish welfare state, never mind that what he is proposing will eject the country from the EU with almost 100% certainty). It sounds really, really good to a guy who lost his job 5 years ago and need *something*, *anything* to happen, but it is non-solutions regardless. And for the wrong problems to boot.

Or from inside. Amancio Ortega, founder of Inditex and richest man in Europe, is collecting 900 millions euros every year in dividends and investing all of it on real estate. 6 billions invested outside and 4 billions inside. [Article about that](http://business.financialpost.com/2014/03/21/how-zaras-founder-amancio-ortega-has-quietly-built-a-us10-billion-all-cash-real-estate-empire/?__lsa=ce71-aa23).  It says something that the rich people in Spain doesn't invest a cent inside the country except in real estate and construction even after the bubble.


&gt; What foreign investor would ever put money into a country with unstable politics where a notable party is openly discussing the seizure of private property and labour policies that would lower productivity while increasing costs?

The same that would invest in a country that has a bigger party that wants to withdraw the EU and put a border again with its biggest market(if you count the full EU as one market). It's not like the two big parties doesn't support the IMF program and are planning higher taxes for fresh food and energy for domestic users to fund more cuts on the corporate taxes. And we are raising the retirement age to 67 from 65. And Spain has introduced a sostenibility factor to the pension system that would have the pension growing a 0.25% nominal until the social security has budget surplus(read never).

And there is a chance that we approve a new labour market reform that would allow the employers to decrease the salary of their employees unilaterally. It has been requested by the IMF and business owner association, but this isn't moving.

Be honest Spain has very stable politics. And the government is the hands of conservative party with absolute majority and after the next elections they will rule in coalition with the progressive PSOE. You can count with stable  pro-austerity governments that will keep the current policies until 2019. And Spain may go into bankruptcy before that year anyway.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  We need to be a superpower as powerful as China and the US

fact is, we can't both match the US military budget AND maintain our social programs. The US have somewhat a mild ""military first"" policy on the budget side. We don't. Sure we need to modernize and have a few more toys but i'd rather we stay around a 2% of the GDP in defense and be able to defend ourselves but without an enormous standing army, than have like the US *as much weaponry* than the entire rest of the planet put together (not counting what ever they hide in storage/mothball) but then have to fight just to maintain barely usable healthcare and roads in half the country.

So while we do need to rise up, i'm pretty sure it's easier to stay military buddies with the US and rise a bit mil spending but avoid grossly twisting our budget to buy billions of planes and gazillions of warships just to stick it to the russians. We *could* but then what ? another cold war while people have to rationate power because they can barely afford the bills like the average russian pensioner ? Is that the life we wants for our kids; bare survival scrapping by forever ? we have better things to do with that cash while we do have some spare, especially with the current crisis, and the automatization/robots-everywhere-taking-our-jerbs unemployement crisis looming in a short few decades. 

I'd say if the US wants to foot the ridiculous military bills let them foot it. we need to spend enough for our own protection but not much more. We're not the world police, merely our own sphere of influence's.

Now what we need is a *common defense* in Europe. Ensuring that money is properly coordinated across multiple countries, equipement standardisation, cooperating, military command integration, rooting out heavy military corruption in the baltics could probably do a lot more good (but c y u yelling russians in 3...2...1... even if we were to kick nato out of the continent and put an EU army instead).

&gt; But leave Nato today, no thank you. (...) Have some Russian experience, you'll come back with tail between your legs waving US flag.

Why? If they want to come here there are avenues available to apply legally. Why should a Mexican get priority over a person from Sierra Leone just because he was born in Tijuana and not Freetown? Neither were born in the United States, per our laws. Should American tax dollars be building schools in other countries and providing health care for those people as a matter of policy when those needs aren't met for the population we already have? If my neighbor bob is down on his luck or is wrecked with debt and his family has been here for seven generations, building the roads, the water system, fighting our wars, driving our trucks, or even as doctors or judges, should his family's contributions be measured as equally rewarded as someone from a failed or failing state?

""And as far as I know that impoverished population of mexico is already within the United States. Many of them already established US citizens. ""

No. They're not. That's what makes them Mexican is that they're in Mexico and not in the US and not citizens. Jesus. If people of Mexican descent are here legally, thats fine. Lots of spanish speaking families were in that part of the country before the territory was ceded by Mexico to the US. 

Mexico is a failing state. Like Panama and Columbia and to a smaller extent other South American countries wrecked by the drug trade before it. I take it that from this forum you live in Europe. There is an outright war going on in Mexico over the trade of Meth and Cocaine and it's killed more people than Americans died in Vietnam and the Korean War. We can either legalize the drug trade to deflate the war chest of these organizations or, as governments fall to the interest of Narcos, draw a line in the sand and keep illegality out by force. If you'd like to apply via the methods in place, if you'd like to do it legally, that's still welcome. But everyday, EVERYDAY along the border of Mexico people are killed or are killing who have no business being in the US. We have problems enough in our own cities we can barely deal with. Now we have to deal with Mexico's shit too?

Nel senso che le critiche che sta facendo Scanzi sono SOLO su un piano di comunicazione della proposta politica, non sulla proposta in sé.

Analizzare una sconfitta e dire che l'unico sbaglio attivo che ha fatto Grillo è non aver parlato con Renzi è una scemenza. è troppo poco, è comunque un voler giustificare un movimento che ha appena preso una tranvata in testa dicendo ""non ti preoccupare, non è colpa tua, non cambiare linea, tieni i toni più bassi e non far parlare quelli più impresentabili, ma per il resto vai benissimo così"".

Se non lo vedi vuol dire che stiamo leggendo due articoli diversi, più dettagliatamente di così non lo so spiegare.

Più in generale, su Scanzi: la sua partigianeria è talmente palese che non c'è bisogno di ribadirla, spero. Va in tv a fare battutine da avanspettacolo che poi può rilanciare su twitter e darle in pasto alle sue fan (""i voti della Picierno le prendeva pure un facocero lol"" ""se Renzi è credibile Giovanardi è una trans brasialiana lol"").

Le pochissime volte che fa ""l'articolo critico sui 5 stelle"", che è ormai un format stanco che ripete con cadenza regolare per darsi il tono dell'equidistante, segue un ributtante schema sempre uguale:

- dire che tale deputato grillino ha sbagliato a fare questa cosa (quasi sempre prendendosela con i difetti fisici, o di facciata, del singolo eletto; basta vedere cosa ha fatto con Crimi).

- battuta da avanspettacolo che non fa ridere nessuno

- analisi dell'errore, sempre e solo di comunicazione, esposizione di come l'avrebbe fatta lui

- battuta da avanspettacolo

- il punto più alto: MA GLI ALTRI SONO PEGGIO. Segue pippone contro il PD, condito di insulti alla Picierno o alla Moretti o a chi passa per di là in quel momento, spesso con quella carica di sessismo che da quelle parti è sempre molto apprezzata

Not to be a dick but to actually be a bit of a dick, you are right: it also involved [toppling governments \(often democratic ones\) that went against American interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_United_States_foreign_regime_change_actions) (Syria, Iran, Guatemala, Brazil, Chile...), [supplying dictators to fight against enemy regimes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran-iraq_war), [arming and financing barbaric warlords to fight off the Soviet Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Afghanistan#Foreign_involvement_and_aid_to_the_mujahideen) and in general doing a lot of really shady shit even without direct military involvement (of which there was plenty too).

Look at history before 1991 and you might rethink some of those statements. I do not believe Western Europe could have defended itself alone against the Soviet Union, nor do I think the US playing no part in WWII would have ended well either.

Sorry dude but just no. Briefly: American Cold War deployments to Europe were never intended to stop the Soviet Union (the plan was always to use nukes against an invasion), they were there to immediately draw the US into the war without delay (which was something European leaders feared might happen). American involvement in WWII didn't come as a gesture of goodwill either: it was Germany and Italy that declared war on it.

&gt; You also seem to think the US military can only do wrong

Not really, but would you seriously argue that the ability of the US military to quickly deploy around the world exists in order to help people? rather, the US military possess strong power projection capabilities which, as a side effect, can be put to peaceful uses.

I understand it but I don't speak it.

&gt;Jag hittade det inte! Några enstaka exempel på politiker som gör dumma uttalanden, men väldigt få. Absolut inte på någon märkvärdig skala. 

I would say that the leaders of both the biggest parties aren't fringe. The S leader Sahlin said something to the effect of Swedes being jealous of Turkish ""real culture"" from what I recall and saying you had just bad/silly things like Midsummer decorations if I recall correctly.

&gt;""Det kan ibland vara bra att ödmjukt påminna om att väldigt mycket av det som är Sverige har skapats i utveckling, just för att vi varit öppna för att ta emot andra människor och andra erfarenheter"", after explaining the meaning of ""ursvenskt är bara barbariet"".

So in other words he's saying that ""it's important to look to outward contributions as well"" after having stated that the native contributions were purely barbaric?

&gt;You see, our immigration dates back from hundreds of years ago. 

&gt;We've had immigration for a very, very long time. Our country was indeed shaped from it.

No, frankly it doesn't and it's a ridiculously dishonest claim your left relies on. 

I have read swedish history fairly extensively and immigration started with humanitarian efforts for fleeing Chileans in the 50s/60s under your Social Democrats. Before that you had a historic immigration of a few hundred Germans, French and Walloons total coming to Sweden's capital and the port cities. 

&gt;In fact, the mass immigration of wallonier is still spoken about today.

I did actually read up on that since it was brought up so much in your history books and found that there were only around 1200 people total, mostly skilled smiths, that came over and one third of those left for Belgium within a year. 

If those 800 people are ""mass-immigration"" then would you consider current modern swedish immigration to be mass-immigration? 

I seem to recall that the left got very upset when people used that term to describe modern immigration into Sweden.

&gt; ""Det ursvenska"" that does not mean ""the swedish culture"" it means that which originated from Sweden without any interference from other areas. 

Ur- denotes original. So that would be original Swedish culture from what I gather. 

&gt; I don't know what DN or Aftonbladet wrote about the word, but surely Reinfeldt using it is enough to convince you that it is a politically correct word.

The common term is, from a quick google, ""fiskar i grumligt vatten"". Simply that it became a debate of it's own point about his use of the word seem to point to it being politically incorrect.

&gt;Your obsession with ethnicity makes you seem like a racist

When you discuss issues of native ethnic groups ethnicity will be a factor. You might as well declare people racist for bringing up ethnicity when talking about self-determination of people groups in the middle-east or eastern europe.

&gt;I think you've completely misunderstood what being Swedish is. The truth is, we've had a lot of discussions on it in the media

The media which overwhelmingly consists of your cosmopolitan elites. I did not find their sentiment very represented at all among normal people even when working in cosmpolitan Stockholm.

&gt;It's about what WE, the Swedes, call Swedish. We have very honest and open debates about it. 

Not in the least as far as your media is concerned. It's essentially leftist circlejerks even on the state television shows like Debatt.

Meta-debates were from what I recall the modus operandi, when someone did mention ethnicity it became a question of ""should we even be discussing this?"", ""is the person racist for discussing it?"", ""won't it lead to ill-feelings by discussing this"", ""won't it play into anti-immigration feelings hands to discuss this"" and a hundred other nonsensical criticisms rather than facing the arguments themselves. 

&gt;and try to acknowledge that the swedish ethnicity is not so well-defined.

All those questions come down to nationality. They are swedish citizens and thus deserve the same protections from the state. That doesn't mean they're ethnically swedish, which is part of the genetic ethnic swedish group, anymore than they would be ethnically chinese for being brought up in chinese culture. 

This is essentially what I said about ethnic erasure. You conflate the national notion with the ethnic one and thus displace the ethnic voice to push the national one when they really are two very different debates at their core. One is about belonging to the nation and one is about the views of one of it's ethnic groups. It's very important to differentiate because if you don't your essentially quashing one groups right to voice their concerns.

&gt;But your attitude towards it is frightning to me. 

Well i'm not surprised. People are generally frightened when their assumptions are put to question and the youth party in the video are hardly shy about it. That's why cognitive dissonance is so strong and why I used to vehemently hate anyone who questioned my socialist, socioliberal and atheist views in my youth.

&gt;I'll make it even worse for you, my last name is Algerian, as my father was half French, half Algerian. 

I'd say that makes it kind of amusing. Algerians are after all extremely hostile to notions of Frenchmen being part of their own country, even to the point of ethnically cleansing the Pied Noirs, and the left seems to be fine with that whereas mild immigration opposition gets them very angry.

&gt;Is Sweden not for her? Can she not be a part of ""oss""?

Well looking at the nationalist SD types now they seem to go on about an ""open swedishness"" and building a civic identity that everyone who puts in an effort can join. 

That is essentially what you've been talking about. 

&gt;I couldn't feel safe in my country if we're not all equals, if Sweden does not belong to all of us who are from there. 

Well it doesn't belong to anyone and everyone. It belongs to Sweden's native people and it's citizens.  

&gt; I hope I made some sense. I'd also like to add an apology, I'm sure you're not a racist. I know it's a really nasty thing to be accused of.

No worries. I have long since stopped caring when people call names on the internet. Rational argument is all I really care about on here.

&gt;It's just that what I heard from you, I often hear from racists (I've grown up with neonazis and racists, in part).

Well those neo-nazis and racists views don't all grow from nothing so it's not surprising that they would also show some similar views. 

They are generally extremely radicalized people, to the point that they've grown to view things in black and white, who feel disenfranchised in some fashion and I think the displacement of the ethnic people's voice is definitely one of the big factors of that. 

I doubt half as many people would find themselves attracted to those kind of views and groups if they didn't have elitist media people and immigrants denying and deconstructing their ethnic people groups and cultures very existence.

I do view immigration concerns as valid. I don't think an exit is needed for anyone worried about those and don't think we should make tons of exceptions everywhere either. Just lower the criteria some more so countries can be even more strict on it and have the nationalists shut up about it that way because regardless of what's thrown around a ton of countries could handle immigration more strictly and efficiently then they currently do whilst still within the limits of EU regulations. I think Flemish elections with the decline of the far right and the popularity of Magie de Block were a big example of doing so without throwing all the ""muh jerbs"" ""dem leeches"" bs around.

I for example am pro federalisation in the long run. That's my opinon and think it's a bigger point then the TTIP. I however think that people too often think of governments on a step by step basis. They can focus at multiple things at the same time and they do. Drafting the TTIP will not take away from any legislature that may affect macro economics and thus greatly influence jobs for the young and whatnot.

Possibly because you're being dishonest as fuck. 

It was in 1995 they overwhelmingly elected an ex-Centre politican Mikael Jansson as Leader expressively to kick out the neo-nazis and bomber jackets crowd whom left to form Hembygdspartiet the very same day Jansson was elected.

They've essentially only elected reformists since Jansson with Åkesson kicking out the last remnants of people with non-civic national views whom left to form the National Democrats. 

Before Jansson they were a basically an activist movement trying to become a party that had Centrists (Jansson) and Moderate euroskeptics (Åkesson) in parts of the country and skinhead booted thugs (""Zeilon"" as he apparently called himself) in others.

Up until now, the ECR has been an important majority-bringer for the European People's Party (EPP), of which the CDU/CSU is also a member, said the European politics expert. If the AfD were to become a member of the ECR, it would have a ""very significant European platform"", Kaeding explained, a situation which would not be in Merkel's interest because the EPP would then have to form a coalition with the AfD.""

So Merkel of the EPP is going to have a chat with the ECR and say; ""look chaps, i really don't think you should let these people join your party... because i'd rather you didn't""

And the ECR would respond; ""oh, we had no idea. sure, we've no problem with the notion of an external party representative vetoing potential members of our party. go wild!""

nonsense.

In the UK we don't have a law here, [but we do have a constitutional convention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_conventions_of_the_United_Kingdom). Thus, in the case that a fringe party were named PM, it would be a breach of this constitutional convention. Constitutional conventions are almost never broken in the UK and if they are broken new laws are enacted. So the situation is quite a bit different from the EU where this is a specific legislative provision governing how the Commission President is chosen.

Die Piraten haben interne Auseinandersetzungen austragen müssen, in denen es darum ging ob die Partei sich auf Kernthemen (Bürgerrechte) beschränken soll oder ob man zusätzlich noch ""linke"" Themen wie soziale Gerechtigkeit, Grundeinkommen usw. bedienen möchte.

Diese Konflikte wurden sehr ""transparent"" bzw. öffentlich ausgetragen, es sind in mehrere Wellen prominente Mitglieder beider ""Lager"" ausgetreten. Das Ganze hat dann dazu geführt,  dass die Partei wenige handlungsfähig wurde (meine Einschätzung von Außen) und weniger Menschen wussten was sie überhaupt wählen wenn sie den Piraten die Stimme geben.

Nel viaggio incontrò Atlante che reggeva **non** il mondo, come tutti credono, ma la volta celeste, che stava quasi per fregarlo.

Costui è evidentemente da identificare con la catena montuosa dell'Atlante, che dà poi il nome all'Oceano.

Ecco anche spiegato perché i pomodori (una volta detti anche pomidoro al plurale) si chiamano così.

true,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"&gt; the Dakotas - actually below German murder rate

Uh, no. [The annual intentional homicide rate in Germany is 0.8 according to the latest figures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#By_country). In 2012, it was 3.0 in South Dakota and 4.0 in North Dakota, up from 0.9 and 0.6 respectively in 2012. In 12 years, the murder rate in the Dakotas has increased from being on a par with Germany's to about four times the German rate. In the same period, the murder rate in New York State has fallen from about 5.0 to 3.5.

Of all the states, Louisiana has the highest murder rate. Louisiana does not require permits to purchase or licences to own, allows open carry without a permit in most cases and is a ""shall issue"" state for concealed carry. Next is Mississippi: no permits to purchase required, no owner licence required, open carry allowed, ""shall issue"" for concealed carry. Then Alabama: no permits or licences required, open carry usually allowed except in vehicles, ""shall issue"" for concealed carry. Finally, we get to Michigan, where permits to purchase are required, but owner licences are not; handguns must be registered, open carry allowed, ""shall issue"" for concealed carry. Then South Carolina: no permits, no licences, no registration, open carry not allowed, ""shall issue"" for concealed carry. At #5, Missouri: no permits, licences or registration, open carry usually allowed, ""shall issue"" for concealed carry. So of the 5 most murderous states, only one has any sort of decent gun control.

&gt; Even the knife-only US murder rate is higher than the total German one. 

Which points to a culture of violence. This isn't helped much by allowing people to own firearms. With a gun, you can kill half a dozen people without them ever seeing you.

&gt; You say US Intervention has destabilized the world for the worst?

No, I say US *military intervention* has done so.

&gt; What about the Sykes-Picot agreement and decolonization of Africa, how about French control of Indochina?

All examples of really bad foreign intervention that created lots of problems. But it's not like Europe's own faults cancel out the US's; if anything, they reinforce the point that dropping bombs on foreign people is generally not the way to go.

&gt; The US gave a lot of material support with the lend-lease act to Europe prior to an Axis declaration of war against the United States

It was called Lend-Lease for a reason, the stuff wasn't given away for free. Or rather, *some* of it was, *after* the US entered the war. For example, the oft-cited US aid to the USSR was paid for in gold and minerals until the US entered the war.

&gt; and you skipped over the fact that there was another front in the Pacific.

I didn't really skip over anything, you explicitely cited US intervention in Europe. But again: the US didn't open the Pacific front out of the goodness of its art, it was attacked by Japan.

”Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Nigel Farage and accept he is the greatest hero Britain has ever had. Even greater than Churchill himself!!
At this moment, a brave, homosexual, transgender Labour champion who placed on the autism spectrum and understood the necessity of big government and fully supported all decisions made by Tony Blair stood up.
”What is the difference between a group of Romanians and a group of Germans living next to you?”
The arrogant professor smirked quite Hitlery and smugly replied “You know the difference, Romanians statistically commit more crime.”
”Well statistically Germans commit more GENOCIDE and I'd rather have my things stolen than be genocided”
The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Mein Kampf. He stormed out of the room crying those Nationalist crocodile tears. The same tears Nationalists cry for the ""dying"" white race even though they make up 8% of the worlds population. He wished so much that he could end his life via doctor assisted suicide but he himself had campaigned against it!
The students applauded and all registered Labour that day and accepted Ed Miliband as their lord and savior. A pigeon named “Welfare Dependency” flew into the room and perched atop the communist flag and shed a tear on the chalk. Red Flag was sung several times, and Ed Miliband himself showed up and enacted an 80% tax on the rich.

The concept of free movement and the Schengen Area are separate. I think in the case of both there are some advantages and some disadvantages.

&gt; Do you think European Union citizens from other countries should be able to work in your country? 

In general terms, yes. However, I think this should depend on other factors too (e.g. impact on infrastructure / housing / needs of economy) etc.

&gt; Do you think there European Union citizens from other countries should be able to live in your country?

Do you mean live and not work or study etc? Yes, in general terms. But again this should depend on other factors too (as per question 2). 

&gt; How would you address immigration concerns?

Leave EU and EEA, give control of immigration to national parliament. Enact legislation similar to Canadian legislation.

&gt; How do you view the European Project?

Some good things and some bad ones.

&gt; Did you vote in the last European elections?

Yes

&gt; Which way did you vote?

UKIP. (You have them listed under two options).

As for Turks, I've met many who are very white skin tonned and others dark olive like in Greece so it is similair . . it is the same for example in Iran where most people are very white skin toned . . especially the non-arab Persians.

Same goes for Italy - Sicily/Southern Italy boot = Olive skinned while North Italy = pasty white.

As far as for why people consider Greeks white and Turks ""non-white"" - it is simply because ""White"" has gone from meaning a Skin tone to meaning a culture.

What are you looking at? If austerity was to answer the ''debt crisis'' (we're discussing that, yes?) then it's clear failure. We didn't reign on debt at all, it's growing and ability of the nations to meet their obligations is impaired. Not to mention disinflation and other obvious side-effects that escaped realm of probability and entered reality. 

&gt; But I haven't seen any credible alternative to the necessary cutting back of massive overspending.

That's because you deem it necessary; US, Japan, UK… to name a few, don't. Of course there are alternatives, call it easing or debt-restructuring or whatever is on the table these days. 

Each of these alternatives is more prudent than unrestrained cuts within entangled system that undermine its structural integrity.., it's not science but common sense.

Yes, and some folks/institutions, such as IMF, admitted these mistakes publicly, not sure why you feel the need to ignore that?

This is because the hard fought post-crisis financial reforms in the US would have to be reversed to match the EU regulations. The EU has tried enacting similar reforms but they have been gutted by the UK and other nations with large financial sectors.

Financial industry interest groups in the US would love US financial regulations to match EU regulations, i.e. be included in the deal. Industry groups in London would like financial services to be excluded to get additional business form the US. 

But, given the fact the exclusion is at the insistence of the US, its not the industry groups. US politicians dont want to have to reverse reforms that were incredibly hard fought against the financial industry. Similar reforms were promised in the EU, but have not come to fruition, and keep being postponed. The new target is 2020 (originally 2012). Given of the history of them being substantially blocked, I am not sure 2020 is a realistic target even though its 8 years late.

true,Rc72,EURO,European Union,"&gt; auditing the debt to calculate how much of it is legit (really why is this even a question?)

Why? Well, because it isn't at all clear what's meant by ""legit"", or what they'd do afterwards.

Let's explain: what is the public debt? We are talking about bonds and suchlike which the country has sold to investors in order to finance its running deficit, the difference between what it spends and what it gets from taxes and suchlike. Deficit which, at the moment is around 5-6% of the GDP, depending on who you are asking. Since public expenditure is about half of GDP, this means that over one euro in ten that the government spends is actually borrowed.

Now, what is argued by Podemos and others is that much of that debt is ""illegitimate"", because it is money that the state had to borrow to lend in turn to the banks to bail them out, something it should have never done. There is quite some merit in that argument, but unfortunately somebody holding a Spanish government bond can't know whether the money he paid for it was used to provide essential social services, for bailing out a bank, or to pay some politician's football crony for building a superfluous road to nowhere. Moreover, those bonds are traded in the secondary markets, which means that they may change hands quite a few times before they come to maturity and the state pays them back (with interest).

Now, if a Podemos government came to the conclusion, after a citizen's audit, that, say 50% of that debt is ""illegitimate"" and consecuently decided that it is only going to pay back 50% of it, the ones who are going to be hurt are not those who have gorged themselves with that money, but the current bondholders. Not necessarily the same people...

There's another, much more immediate perverse consequence, and it's the infamous ""risk premium"" (""prima de riesgo""). If there is a perceived risk that you *may* default, that is, not pay back your debt in full, people are obviously less likely to lend you money. Just like a private person, the government is going to have to go to ""loan sharks"", asking a much higher interest rate to compensate for their risk. This is why, at some moments at the height of the euro crisis, Spain or Italy had to offer an interest rate of 6% and more to sell its bonds, whereas German bonds were being sold at much lower (even negative!) interest rate. Just *talking* about such a ""citizen's audit"" makes those who may buy Spanish bonds nervous, increasing the interest rate on Spanish debt. And the higher that interest rate becomes, the more money the government has to spend just to service the debt and keep it from increasing even further.

And if Spain indeed reneged even partially on its debt, *nobody* would buy a Spanish bond anymore, at least not for a long while. In the meantime, the government would not be able to keep borrowing money to finance its deficit. The outcome? A 10-15% cut in public spending, overnight.

&gt; The common security and defence policy shall include the progressive framing of a common Union defence policy. This will lead to a common defence, when the European Council, acting unanimously, so decides

My own understanding is that the Lisbon Treaty paves the way for greater cooperation should member states desire, but it didn't do a huge amount to actually further cooperation itself.

A few more passages from Art 42:

&gt; The policy of the Union in accordance with this Section shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States ...

&gt; Commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.

Article 42(7) (which was mentioned in what you linked) isn't hugely threatening in reality:

&gt;  If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. This shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States.

And, just for reference here is Article 51 of the UN Charter:

&gt; Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.",0,1401303865,null,0,false,0,chtc7io,t3_26pqxs,t1_chtc7io,t1_chtbekl,null,1433993072,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

The other reason is [that the credit card company takes on the same liability as the retailer](http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/problem/can-i-claim-on-my-credit-card-when-something-goes-wrong), even when you only pay part of the balance.

You have the same rights against your credit card company as you have against the retailer or trader.

This also applies for things like flights being cancelled or if your TV breaks and the retailer is unhelpful.

While for example in Greece it went from 3-5 million 500 hundred years ago to 10 million today. 

This is because to assimilate into Ottoman Empire, all you had to do was follow Islam, which hundreds of thousands of Greeks chose to do, so they could avoid the Jizya Tax/Persecution and eventually Genocide in Early 20th Century.

Ahahahha, i doubt that : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures

And that's just the official budget. If you count all the blackfunds, deals under the table etc the us military budget is probably nearer a trillion dollar. 

per. year.

And even if somehow our budget is close, we don't have the bottomless piles of weapons or old weapons in mothballs they have everywhere in the US. I wouldn't be surprise if they could still *twice* overnight the amount of gear they have on the ground if there ever was a real war they'd get caught in and fight tooth and nails (E.G: fictious alien invasion, conventional WWIII with russia+china+...) and still have some margin.


.... buuut unlike the US we don't have to try to rule or even police the world. Only to deal with things coming up on our continent, and the area around (let's say north africa, a bit of the middle east, and deal with russia somehow without starting a war, since they recently proved they hated us in ukraine.

The EU's role in pacifying the former Yugoslavia would probably have been included if it wasn't built as a short form video.

I think you can probably count the half a million people killed in the Crimean war as a Major war. The Franco-Prussian War killed upwards of 100 thousand and had an aftermath that featured 20,000 dead in the streets of Paris. 

The wars of German and Italian formation were tremendously costly. In the battle of Solferino the  Austrian army lost more lives in a day(2,386) than the US army has lost in Afghanistan in 13 years(1,742).

Europe's mid to late 19th century was better than the way it started, but that was because it was dedicating its energies to savagely subjugating much of the rest of the world. The tensions built up over this 'peace' also led to the 20th century wars.

The one sentence your refer to is certainly inelegant, but it hardly torpedos the whole video. 

And yes Yugoslavia was crappily governed. Romania had lovely relations with the US(see picture below), and that regime was a nightmare.

&gt; the upstart **anti-austerity** Five Star Movement

Mah, caro Lei, io l'anti-austerità dei 5S l'ho vista poco; forse c'è, scritta in piccolo in qualche meandro del loro manifesto, ma non è certo stato il pilastro della loro campagna elettorale (a meno che ""Io sono OLTRE Hitler!"" non si riferisse alla ripresa dell'economia tedesca grazie al riarmo, nel qual caso si potrebbe davvero parlare di politiche anti-austerità).

&gt; Consumer confidence data out today provides another fillip for Renzi’s cause

Ahah ma insomma, ma l'abbiamo letto davvero il grafico? l'ascesa dell'indice di fiducia dei consumatori inizia ad aprile 2013, con Letta neoinsediato a palazzo Chigi e Renzi a fare il sindaco di Firenze. Ci potrà mai dire qualcosa su Renzi? forse che sta cogliendo i frutti di una timida ripresa della fiducia iniziata un anno prima del suo governo, ma nulla di più.

&gt; But Italy’s long history of false starts makes this quite a gamble. Until there is more tangible evidence of durable reforms, the risk is that the recent rise in optimism will fizzle like so many before it in Rome—yet another example of the triumph of hope over experience. 

Alé, chiosa finale vagamente moralistica ma con aria saggia, che fa tanto ""eeeeh questi italiani, che scalmanati creduloni"". Nonché vagamente paracula: tutto un articolo su Renzi qui fiducia là e poi mi termini con ""però oh, cazzo ne sò poi io"".

Ecco, appunto. Diciamo qualcosa di meno scontato e meno certo ma forse un po' meno banale: Renzi ha sfondato in queste elezioni perché a) il suo governo è ancora nella fase luna di miele in cui si possono prendere decisioni (80€, taglio IRAP) senza affrontare le conseguenze (voglio ridere l'anno prossimo quando dovranno ri-trovare le coperture), b) perché si è trovato di fronte una destra sparigliata come mai prima (il centro-destra non si era *mai* presentato con ben 4 gruppi diversi e tutti mutualmente ostili) e c) perché il suo principale potenziale avversario, Grillo, ha lasciato a casa metà degli elettori, forse a forza di mesi in cui non combinava nulla se non urlare tanto.",0,1401307642,null,0,false,0,chte4rm,t3_26pd44,t1_chte4rm,t3_26pd44,null,1433993978,8,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,8

Chinese having a sweet deal with Russia will make border disputes easier, and make the Chinese more likely to cooperate in the Security Council (and, for that matter, in Pacific operations). 

The west being forced to put more spending into defense will make a lot of small nations very nervous and more likely to buy russian defense systems (think, e.g. Jordan, or the Lebanon, or Syria, or about three douzen central asian nations, who all have an interest in keeping ""independent"").

It's not creepy at all. And it's not just the US that does it. Hell, this post is on the front page of /r/Canada right now:

http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/26pgj3/o_canada_at_bell_centre_sun_by_fans_sens_vs_habs/

It's Canadians singing their national anthem at a regular NHL game. Is that creepy to you?

&gt;Maybe you don't cross them but both you and I know a lot of your compatriots are hyper nationalistic

Hyper-nationalistic? Really? Where and why do you have that impression. This is simply patriotism. A love for our country. I honestly think you do not understand the nuances of patriotism here. It is hard to explain the feeling behind the love for our country, and it is never to be confused with an unquestioning love for our government. Hell, the most patriotic segment of our country *hate* the government and everything it does.

&gt;the US nationalism can get obnoxious and pretentious at times.

Dude, I see comments on /r/europe *all* the time that put our nationalism to shame. Plus, we don't really give a damn if you find it obnoxious. We love our country, and we don't need to justify it to anyone. We couldn't give a shit less if it bothered you Europeans. That's your problem. And your incessant nagging and finger wagging at us for having the audacity to love our country gets **REALLY FUCKING OBNOXIOUS AND EXTREMELY PRETENTIOUS** at times. If you wanna really piss an American off, tell him how he should feel about his own country. That won't go over very well.

It's a small minority of people (say, 3% of the population, allowing for increase since 1994, if the Focus number is actually correct. Actual data would be nice ...) who owns guns. You may argue that this is not ""almost nobody"", but it's certainly not as big a fraction as using numbers like ""30 guns per 100 people"" suggests. And this number still looks wrong, I don't think that people own 10 guns on average.

And this matches my own experience (I don't know *anyone* personally who actually owns a gun, or 5, or 10) a lot better.

Pour ce qui est de la biodynamie, c'est exactement comme l’homéopathie: Ce n'est pas la substance qui soigne, mais les comportements collatéraux.
Les biodynamiques viennent du bio et/ou de la permaculture où le crédo est d'assurer la biodiversité insectes/plantes/humus qui assure un rempart de masse contre les agressions, ne pas écraser les sols, ne pas exiger des rendements indécents etc.. Étrangement quand a plus besoin de mettre ses cultures sous perfusions ( cf céréaliers qui cultivent hors sol en fin de compte ) et qu'on laisse les mécanismes naturels se remettre en place, ça va mieux. 

Pareil pour l’homéopathie, ça concerne une population plus à l'écoute de son corps, de son alimentation, de son mode de vie. C'est ça qui renforce son système immunitaire, pas des boulettes de sucre au milliardième de gramme de venin d'abeille.

 Je connais une famille qui avec le recul aurait volontiers traité l'otite de leur gamin avec des antibiotiques au lieu de l'avoir rendu sourd avec l'homéopathie.

As the Sacré-coeur has been built to redeem the ""faulty"" parisian people of 1870's commune up to the 1919, it's a symbol which is much more linked to our political present. 

It has been built under the third republic, which was very conservative, especially at the begining. Mac Mahon was a legitimist. He was a general which ordered the army to fire upon french people. The reason why monarchy didn't took over again was just because different groups of monarchists couldn't find a common ground. Mac Mahon forbid 14th july celebrations, removed symbols of the republic and ordrered the sacré coeur to be built and he did everything he could to stop republicans. The Sacré-Coeur is an anti-republican building. 

The fresco every one can see today is just amazingly colonialist and racist. On the right side, you can see the whole french society, including savages from the colony kneeling in front of Jesus. On the other side, it's the rest of the world. There even is a native american looking quietly to Jesus. The only character which turn is back to Jesus is a ""sans-culottes"".

thérapeutique de préparations élaborées à
partir de «substances-mères » fortement dilu
ées et « dynamisées ». Elle se fonde sur
quelques principes :

&gt;&gt;•
La loi de similitude selon laquelle « une substance qui produit des symptômes
chez une personne bien portante peut guérir ces mêmes symptômes chez
une personne malade ». À chaque remède homéopathique d’origine animale,
végétale ou minérale, sont ainsi associ

bonne santé manifesterait si elle absorbait cette substance.

Les principes de haute dilution et de
dynamisation par agitation de la solution,
dont les procédés sont supposés libérer « l’esprit intime des substances »,
étant à même d’agir sur l’énergie vitale du malade.

&gt;&gt;•
La loi de l’individualisation du traitement
(« il n’y a pas de maladies, seulement
des malades »), utilisée en association avec la notion de « terrain » du patient. 

&gt;Aucune de ces études n’a montré d’efficacité de l’homéopathie, pourtant certaines étaient de bonne qualité. L’effet clinique est non distinguable d’un effet placebo qui est quant à lui connu et démontré.

I love this area, Walk South on the Canal Saint Martin, it's beautiful and full of life. There's a little sluice where boats go through to adjust water levels, it's a cool attraction.

Stalingrad is a cool neighborhood. Walk toward the metro (it'll be aerial), and pass it toward the Canal de l'Ourq, there's a bunch of cafés and shit that are cool to sit at if it's nice out. They have boat ride too.

If you like architecture, Gare du Nord and Gare de L'Est are right there. Gare du Nord is the biggest train station in Europe. Kinda ghetto in the metro part though so keep your stuff with you... but it's also full of cops.

I don't know many places to eat there, but just walk down toward the 4th in the Marais and it'll be full of things. I used to be a valet at [Chez Julien](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chez+Julien/@48.8544353,2.3558996,17z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1schez+julien!3m1!1s0x47e671e2b6030813:0x514d9579ed8662c), right behind the Hotel de Ville. It's good food (maybe a little expensive), but the area is really beautiful).

If you walk to Barbès, then Anvers, you will see Montmartre and the Sacré Coeur. Just don't hesitate to wander in the streets and get lost. you'll never get lost. there's always a metro station somewhere or someone to tell you where one is and then you can easily get to anywhere.

I also like the parc de Buttes Chaumont, parc de Belleville et and Père Lachaise not too far in the 20th.

If you're staying at a hotel, you can always ask for restaurant recommendations!

And for shorts.... people overthink this way too much... just wear whatever you wanna wear, not everybody is as stylish as a magazine cover there like you'd like to imagine. Enjoy Paris!

Nein. Rassismus bezieht sich nicht auf *irgendeine* Klassifikation, sondern alleine auf eine Zugehörigkeit zu einer mehr oder weniger stark umrissenen genetischen Gruppe. Wer meint, ""alle Tennisspieler sind doof"", ist vielleicht ein Idiot, aber nicht zwangsläufig Rassist.

&gt; Die Gruppe, zu der man selbst gehört, wird mit positiven Eigenschaften beschrieben, die andere mit negativen.

Man kann sehr wohl Rassist sein, der die eigene Gruppe negativ sieht. Rassismus ist nicht zwangsläufig einer Übersteigerung der eigenen in-group.

&gt; Rassisten schauen nicht auf den einzelnen Menschen, sondern ihnen reicht die Zugehörigkeit zu einer Gruppe um ihn zu „kennen“. Wenn sie dann doch Menschen finden, die ihrem Vorurteil entsprechen, fühlen sie sich bestätigt.

Das würde nicht mal in Ethik, 7. Klasse zu mehr als ner Drei reichen.

&gt; Siegfried Jäger (Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, 2002) listet gebräuchliche Formen des sprachlichen Alltagsrassismus auf. Die einzelnen Sätze scheinen manchmal gar nicht problematisch, aber sie implizieren immer ein ""wir"" und ""die"", und ein ""besser"" und ""schlechter"".

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; how are Britain and France more ""experienced"" in defending themselves

Here is a list of wars involving Germany (West and East) since WW2:

* East German Uprising, Invasion of Czechoslovakia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan.

Discounting East Germany, that's only Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan.

Now the UK during the same period:

* Indonesian Revolution, Greek Civil War, Operation Masterdom (part of Vietnam), Malayan Emergency, Korean War, Mau Mau Uprising, Cyprus Emergency, Suez Crisis, Irish Border Campaign, Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, Dhofar Rebellion, Aden Emergency, The Troubles, Falklands, Lebanon Intervention, Gulf War, Bosnian War, Operation Desert Fox, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya

To add emphasis, the UK has been in a near full century of unbroken conflict since August 1914 (WWI declaration).

I fully concede that technology and opposition for the UK, France and Germany equalise some of this. However, there is no plausible way to discount the experience gained from this number and variety of conflicts. Not only has the UK fought more, but they've fought a greater variety of conflicts in terms of opposition, urban environment, context, geographical environment and type of conflict (e.g. single operation, small conflict, war with no/minimal allies, major war, war with multiple allies). In addition to the successes, consider the benefits learned from mistakes made in all these conflicts.

However, since a single, sovereign European Superstate has never existed, the NPT wouldn't apply to it as that state has never ratified the treaty.

For instance the European External Action Service, which Baroness Ashton is head of, is basically the foreign office of the EU and only came into force in 2009! So the EU is finally carving out some sort of foreign policy capabilities/competencies which are essential for in order to have military capabilities (you can't lead an army if you've got no use for them). Additionally, there's the Euro Battle groups, which came into effect in 2007, which also demonstrate the EU recently gaining competencies in that area. As a result of this, Ashton has been playing a pivotal role in lots of international negotiations, not just in Ukraine, but also, for instance, on the Iranian Nuclear Crisis. 

It could be an uphill struggle for the EU to gain more competencies given the change in public opinion since the financial crisis, but Sikorski is probably one of the best potential Commission Presidents to make progress in that area and to make effective use of the tools already at his disposal.

Tra parentesi, prendere alla lettera uno che dice che usa i miti per spiegare le cose non mi sembra una cosa saggia, in ogni caso.

Stavo parlando delle colonne d'Ercole, citando il mito delle 12 fatiche, che mi sembra il primo posto dove andare a cercare qualcosa riguardante la leggenda di Ercole.

Nel mito si dice che le colonne d'Ercole erano praticamente dove la tradizione le ha sempre collocate e dal contesto tutto lascia pensare che sia lì (compresi particolari che non ho citato).

Al contrario, l'ipotesi che le vede collocate nello stretto di Messina non ha indizi neanche nella mitologia, ma è semplicemente una mera ipotesi.

In ogni caso, che i toponimi abbiano riscontri nei poemi epici è una cosa che rientra spesso, vedi il caso di Palinuro, del Circeo (maga Circe) e, sempre per restare nel tema dello stretto di Messina, di Scilla e Cariddi.

&gt;È come fare teorie sull'ubicazione dell'Eden =&gt; Never Happened

Volendo è possibile. Come i luoghi già citati, anche la Geenna (=""inferno"") è un luogo reale, è molto probabile che anche l'Eden sia un luogo realmente esistito su cui poi ci abbiano costruito su un mito.

What are you trying to argue? It reads as though you presume Britain believes its culture is stronger or more individual than the rest of Europe, perhaps as if the rest of Europe is supposedly (in British eyes) much more singular as one cultural entity?

Britain fully understands other nations have strong and individual cultural identities (look at jokes about the French and Germans for instance).

true,rakony,UKGB,United Kingdom,"A few responses. Reform is not any empty buzzword, for undeniably the EU must change. Firstly the EU could clean up its corruption. A recent inquiry by Transparency International found evidence of persistent and endemic corruption within the EU. The EU parliament the rejected discussing its findings. Actually addressing the issues this report raised, issues which concern many people, would be a great way to start reforming. 

More generally the EU should scale back its attempts at further federalisation. An increasing amount of the European public is sceptical of European integration. The EU should abandon, or at least put on indefinite hold, ideas of ever closer union. People joined the EU for two big reasons: one to gain access to the world's biggest trade block and two formalise informal geopolitical alignment. That is the role of the EU and until the public shows willing otherwise that's all it should do. It should not seek further federalisation. 

Now before you claim that well people voted in federalist parties this is not really the case. For example many people in the UK vote Labour in the EU elections, not because they've reviewed Labour MEPs EU policy but because they align themselves with Labour's policies on a national level and wish to support their party. The Labour MEP will be part of Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats which favours further federalisation. However most people who voted Labour in the EU elections will not be in favour of this. Indeed their core electorate, white working class, is in fact quite euroscpetic and opposed to further integration. I would put it to you that this is the same for many of the votes cast.

Finally you claimed it's not the job of British MEPs to represent the UK. What the hell are they there for then? If its not the job of the MEPs to represent the opinion of the British public, the public that elected them, what is their purpose? The fundamental aim of any elected representative is to push the views of their constituents claiming otherwise seems bizarre.",0,1401319390,null,0,1401319650,0,chtjby1,t3_26oml8,t1_chtjby1,t1_chthf2r,null,1433996495,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Quel rôle historique ?

Tu as une drôle de lecture de l'histoire du capitalisme. Il a existé des tonnes de figures des managers, entrepreneurs (au sens schumpeteriens ou non), dirigeants d'entreprises, innovateurs, au fil des derniers siècles (selon le moment où l'on commence l'analyse). 

Lorsque tu veux te lancer dans les affaires (ou dans la création d'une association), personne ne te fait signer une Charte Historique du Chef d'Entreprise. Là encore il s'agit de questions plus complexes : est-ce que c'est ton entreprise ou diriges-tu une structure possédée par d'autres ? Quelle est ta politique de recrutement ? Quels moyens face à quels objectifs ? Faut-il te différencier sur le marché ou non ? Etc.

Bref, le boulot d'un chef d'entreprise, ce n'est pas exclusivement de bien payer ses salariés. Un chef d'entreprise paye ses salariés comme tu payes tes biens ou prestataires de service : il compare différentes options, les met en face de ses besoins, et se fixe un prix lui semblant correct à ce niveau. Il peut faire jouer la concurrence (comme toi qui refuserait d'aller à une boulangerie trop chère ou de payer un médecin trop cher, pour aller voir moins cher), négocier, etc.

&gt; Exploiter sournoisement (ou par incompétence) les rapports de force, c'est le contraire du capitalisme. 

On parle de rapports de force d'un côté. D'un autre, on pourrait plutôt parler d'offre et de demande ; termes plus neutres. D'un côté tu as des centaines de diplômés en psycho qui offrent leur force de travail. De l'autre tu as une demande plus restreinte. Normal que les prix soient à la baisse.

&gt; Si tu as des buts ambitieux mais pas les moyens de tes ambitions, je ne vois pas pourquoi l'employé devrait en porter les risques...

Un patron n'est pas ambitieux ou non selon le niveau de salaire de ses salariés. Il y a des patrons ambitieux et sous-payants leurs salariés ; et des patrons très peu ambitieux/foireux et sur-payants ses salariés par rapport aux prix habituellement pratiqués sur le marché (le prix du travail, du service fourni par les salariés : leur salaire).

Bref, tu mélanges tout. Cela n'a rien à voir avec une dimension historique, une question de mérite, d'ambition, ou autre. On peut trouver tragique la situation des bac +5 en psycho sans pour autant rejeter la faute sur un ""manque d'ambition"" d'un patron.

It's not the only one that gets blamed. The Polish government has caught plenty of flak too. But LibDependancyHell pointed out that the Poles etc in these cases were ""following [the US's] orders"" on this ... and well, they did. That seems relevant. Of course, that they were following orders is no excuse for the crimes they committed by doing so. But those who *gave* the orders carry the greater responsibility, can we agree on that?

I think the Polish government should have had the guts to tell the US to stuff it. But it's not like it's a relation of equals either; for a state which basically depends on the US for its security (or at least feels like it does), it's kind of hard to say no. Again, not that this excuses them! But there's a bit more imbalance of power to take into account than just, hey, ""we didn't invade them"" - that seems a little glib.

&gt;How is that ""acting with impunity""?

You're quoting this article about how there's an ongoing ECHR case, and an Open Society Institute source is saying that the court ""now has an opportunity to break this conspiracy of silence and uphold the rule of law."" Good, that's great. But a bit early to rhetorically ask, how is that ""acting with impunity""? Let's wait to see if there's an actual conviction first - and if any American is convicted, what the response by the US government will be.

People in Europe are so god damn worried about economic effects that they forget the extremely more important human element to this problem.

Where are our European values? Why are these people denied rights that we demand for ourselves and take as granted, simply based on accident of birth? 

These people are living, breathing human beings, and they *deserve* the same rights as we do, and that includes personal safety, and the right to the pursuit of happiness. And that is not and *should not* **ever** be based on any other metric than the fact that they *are* living, breathing human beings.

&gt;The Air Force had also flown 83 refueling missions delivering more than 544,000 gallons of gas to French Rafale and Mirage attack aircraft in close air support of French and Chad troops.

&gt;In March, President Obama authorized $50 million in “immediate military assistance to Chad and France in their efforts to secure Mali from terrorists and violent extremists.” The State Department has also committed $6.6 million to support free elections in Mali.

&gt;The White House also disclosed plans to set up a base in neighboring Niger to operate drone flights over Mali for the French, and also monitor the cross-border movement of fighters from the Boko Haram extremist group in Nigeria in support of AQIM. For now, the Predator and Reaper drones will be unarmed and used only for intelligence and reconnaissance, Defense Department officials said.

&gt;In addition, the U.S. Africa Command has spent $550 million over the past four years to train and equip West African security forces in stabilizing the shaky regimes of the region and in combating terrorism.

&gt;The secretive program, financed in part with millions of dollars in classified Pentagon spending and carried out by trainers, including members of the Army’s Green Berets and Delta Force, was begun last year to instruct and equip hundreds of handpicked commandos in Libya, Niger, Mauritania and Mali.

&gt;The third article is again about sub african immigrants and not the state of their wellbeing in their home countries.

&gt;The fourth is about immigrants being treated like garbage, again not their wellbeing in their home countries.

&gt;The fifth is again about how the Moroccan government treat immigrants.

&gt;None of your articles says that any of the immigrants are poor or they're fleeing war.

You know full well this is as a result of Europe ***paying*** Morocco to do this. And you clearly know very little about the state of Africa, and you blatantly ignored articles that mentioned specifically war and violence.

Here, let me link it to you;

http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2007/09/05/19443/moroccan-crackdown-strands-african.html

There are currently **15** conflicts going on in Africa, 5 of which are going consistently 1000+ deaths per year. 1 of those 5 is in North Africa, 1 is Somalia(Which we all like to forget about), and the other 3 are subsharan countries, the primary source of immigrants. But sure, none of them are fleeing from war. /s

You think wealthy people risk their lives to emigrate here? I'm not trying to be mean, but that is fucking retarded. I a'int gonna deny wealthy people are emigrating, but they're going to do it safe and legally, because we don't turn away people with money.

&gt;Which is? Why are you so mad about people who want to help them in their own countries?

Sorry, I value these people over the state of the economy. It's not like we have a welfare state to take care of the unemployed or anything, that would be a crazy idea.

&gt;If you really want to help these people you volunteer there.

I have. My parents would also have been some of the people you *de facto* condemned to death on the other side of the border, but fuck them right, I guess they just ran shit out of luck because they were born on the wrong side of the Mediterranean. 

&gt;We have doctors without borders and engineers without borders already and that's a huge progress.

Doing very little in the long term. Great organizations, utmost respect to them, but they're not going to realistically fix much. They do amazing work, and they can help small communities, but that's not doing anything to develop a country infrastructurally and it's not creating jobs. 

&gt;If we take in the people who try we're going to need to spend more and more resources in our own countries and less and less in the developing nations.

We spend jack shit on developing nations. We bribe governments to do what we like to suit our corporate interests. For example, Nigeria's main source of income in the long term is going to be oil exports. Which we're encouraging because it means cheaper prices for us.

&gt;Your demands are unrealistic.

No they're not. Okay, maybe they are a little, but if we stuck to ""unrealistic"" ideas, we'd never get anywhere. We should be striving to make these ideas a reality, not sitting by and saying ""It's too much"".

&gt;The economy will decline with a lot of immigrants

Where's your proof of this? I see this getting thrown around a lot; Where is the proof influx of immigrants is directly correlated to economic downturn?

It isn't. People have been mass immigrating to Europe for decades and we've went through several boom-bust cycles, and you know what? Immigrants didn't cause a single one of those. 

Every time we talk about EU enlargement some people harp on about all the immigrants. You know what, the Polish have been moving around Europe for a decade now, and unless you want to pin the Eurocrisis on Polish immigrants, then those claims seem pretty unsubstantiated to me.

&gt;segrigation and cultural conflicts

This, this I can understand. Large, uncontrolled influxes of immigrants into a single country will cause this problem.

But we're 28 countries. Why are we not able to diffuse the immigrant population amongst all of our memberstates, using economic strength, size and population as metrics for who gets how much? 

&gt;Ireland was once a very poor nation but it built itself up

We built ourselves up because we all emigrated and sent the money we earned in other countries back home which stimulated the economy. And we also had the European Union constantly pumping money into the country. The EU has not taken on anywhere close to similar level of investment in a non-EU state, and I don't expect it to unless it suits its interests specifically. 

&gt;No you're saying that everyone who don't agree with you are heartless scum.

I'm not going to say they're heartless. That would be an exaggeration. But I'm not going to say that it's not flat out, a wrong thing to do and it is an extremely poor set of priorities we have if we're going to toss out people who can, in the long term, lead to a net contribution to the countries they both live in and the countries they are coming from, because some right wing parties have scared us with baseless rhetoric.",1,1401325994,null,0,false,0,chtm49t,t3_26pv81,t1_chtm49t,t1_chtlf30,null,1433997809,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

You do know that you're English, right? You do know that it was YOUR country that started this whole globalisation thing by having the empire thing? 



THIS IS YOUR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE TOO YOU SON OF A BITCH

wow, it really grinds my gears when Brits are all upset about ""America's Hegemony"" blah blah

You guys have a pretty fucking good deal:

* you're empire basically still exists, and its because American naval power reinforces its integrity (I'm talking about 5 eyes).

* London has ENORMOUS influence in Washington, probably more than New York does. If I recall correctly, didn't president Reagan call Margaret Thatcher to get her approval before he sent commandos to Grenada?

And do you remember a while back when Obama, Cameron and Hollande agreed to shoot some missiles at Assad? France endoresed it, we were already to go! Obama was ready for it... and then Cameron brought it up to parliament who shot it down AND THEN, HOLY FUCK OBAMA MAGICALLY CHANGES HIS MIND THE NEXT DAY. 

And France was like ""America, we are ready to go! But we can't afford to do it alone."" and Obama just pushed it under the rug. Basically saying that he didn't give a shit about what France wanted, only what Britain wanted.

* How's that whole English as a global language doing for ya? You enjoying that? Because your language is the dominant language because the United States took over as global hegemon from Britain, perpetuating English's dominance

* Britain has enormous soft power that is amplified through America's soft power. There are probably school children in fucking North Korea reading Shakespeare right now (and if not, there sure as hell are in South Korea).
Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit, James Bond, fucking Downton Abbey, Planet Earth, David Attenborough... why are all of those such huge internationally recognized brands?? BECAUSE AMERICA, THATS WHY. The market for British cultural products is MASSIVE, so there is correspondingly a MASSIVE amount of finance available for british artists and that leads to awesome cultural products that they non-english speaking world loves too.

* I don't mean to be offensive, but the Dutch King is not a global figure. Danish king, Swedish king, Norwegian king, Belgian King, Spanish king... nobody knows who these are. Go to Japan, no one will know these monarchs... but if you ask them if they know who Camila Parker-Bowles is they will say ""Duchess of Cornwarru!"" Prince Harry is everywhere.

Bear in mind that the clout of the EU, Pacific Rim nations, and Latin American nations have increased while marginalizing a need to blindly align with Washington's agenda.  Globalization of trade means that the US is no longer the main industrial hub or even has a stranglehold on the world's knowledge base for engineering and business.

For example, you paint the ICC as pointed only at poor African nations, but law enforcement is very often a practice of what's possible not what's optimal.  Much like the Contras' awful crimes in Nicaragua, the practice of warlords is not excused if it happened to be funded by the former Soviet Union, the United States, or another large power.

The ICJ's decision against the US did not hold it responsible for crimes against humanity, only assisting the Contras in doing so which is an incredibly large difference.  

Just today, the President of the United States stated *more* dedication to multilateralism away from military adventurism.  While this leaves lots of room for extrajudicial killings via drones, it is a large step away from large-scale military operations we saw 10 years ago.

The rise of Fascism was not a world shaking event. It was notable, but countries were being led by monarchies for centuries, Fascism was essentially more of the same, but with different emphasis. Nobody could have predicted the Holocaust, so trying to play that card gets you nowhere.

In fact, the outbreak of war is what started the Holocaust, due to the influx of Jews from the Polish territory that was annexed. But that's aside the main point.

Britain and France were not in a fit state to fight a war against Germany, a heavily militarized nation. The two states had just started recovering from a massive economic crisis and the strength disparity in military capabilities between the French + British and the Germans was huge, especially as we got closer to the outbreak of war. The remilitarization of the UK wasn't really fully complete even by 1940. 

And then, we have to take into account that there was a very large amount of sympathizers. Not just on the hand of fellow Fascists in France and Britain, but we have to remember that German actions were, by and large, seen as a rebellion against what was regarded widely as a punitive, extreme peace negotiation. Many leading political figures and generals at the time saw the Versailles Treaty as a prelude to another war. 

Then we have the Stalinist elements within the populations which created political instability, simply because of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and they essentially took their orders from Moscow. In France this was very apparent, even in the middle of the war, when the Germans instigated Operation Barbarossa, the French resistance had a huge influx from the Communists, who until then had done nothing.

It was only around the push for the annexation of the Sudetenland and the later full annexation of Czechoslovakia that people started to realize Germany was after far more than its simple traditional holdings. The ""Peace in Our Time"" speech was a farce, Chamberlain knew it. It was Chamberlain who declared war when the Nazis invaded Poland. He only resigned after the Norway invasion was repelled, as it was a huge blow to not only British morale, but British capabilities in the region. 

So, when you're talking about ""warhawks"" in the 1930s having been beneficial? It would have only changed things for the worst. Warhawks is what caused the Versailles Treaty, and that's a very large part of what caused the rise of Nazism in Germany.

There needs to be a fine balance between diplomacy, economic coercion, and intimidation.

Sorry I must've missed it. Your first article mentioned it, the other four did not however.

&gt; You think wealthy people risk their lives to emigrate here? I'm not trying to be mean, but that is fucking retarded. I a'int gonna deny wealthy people are emigrating, but they're going to do it safe and legally, because we don't turn away people with money.

The first to emigrate is always the higher educated. [Brain drain is a serious concern especially for africa.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_drain#Sub-Saharan_Africa)

&gt; Sorry, I value these people over the state of the economy. It's not like we have a welfare state to take care of the unemployed or anything, that would be a crazy idea.

Holy shit do you actually think money grow on trees? There are tons of requirements to make a welfare state work, it's a delicate balance. There is a reason why USA cannot become a welfare state for instance.

Something that the developing nations have incommon is bad economies and first world nations good economies. Economy is the most important part of a modern society.

&gt; I have. My parents would also have been some of the people you de facto condemned to death on the other side of the border, but fuck them right, I guess they just ran shit out of luck because they were born on the wrong side of the Mediterranean.

You cannot seriously expect 500 million people take care of over 3 billion people in poverty or war. The best way is to help them enough so they can take care of themselves.

&gt; We spend jack shit on developing nations.

Yeah. Why don't we? They're unattractive markets because people in those regions are gerenerally greedy who will instantly take the money and run. A lot of scams come from there. We can change that but it'll take time. One of the foundations of mordern economics is trust.

&gt; We bribe governments to do what we like to suit our corporate interests. 

Suddenly we care about economics, interesting. Yes government in these regions are selfish which means investments in those regions is a better choice than just sending bags of money there.

&gt; For example, Nigeria's main source of income in the long term is going to be oil exports. Which we're encouraging because it means cheaper prices for us.

What's the problem with that? That's actually good. The problem is the conditions people work in. Congo mines kill thousands every (year?) for instance.

&gt; No they're not. Okay, maybe they are a little

Not even a little. No economic expert has said mass immigration is good and none ever will. Mass immigration is only goood for large corporations which means cheaper labour and worse conditions.

&gt; Where's your proof of this? I see this getting thrown around a lot; Where is the proof influx of immigrants is directly correlated to economic downturn?

More workers lead to worse wages and worse conditions. This will in turn only mean more profits to corporations and the economic flows will slow down. This is just economics 101 and if we take it a step further it'll lead to less money spent on welfare and worse conditions for everyone. In economics a lot of things is about balance, which is why a lot of the progressive countries are socialistic and not communistic or kapitalistic.

&gt; It isn't. People have been mass immigrating to Europe for decades and we've went through several boom-bust cycles, and you know what? Immigrants didn't cause a single one of those.

There is a difference between labour immigraiton and overflow immigration. If you look at the statistics countries which take in a lot of immigrants you'll see a trend in higher unemployment, more violent crimes and more segrigation.

&gt; Every time we talk about EU enlargement some people harp on about all the immigrants. You know what, the Polish have been moving around Europe for a decade now, and unless you want to pin the Eurocrisis on Polish immigrants, then those claims seem pretty unsubstantiated to me.

One of the reasons why Sweden is sick of EU is because of Polish, Romanian and Bulgarian workers who work for much less. It has caused companies to go bankrupt and worsened the Swedish economy a whole lot. So yes these immigrants are also not very good, but comparatively they're fewer - plus people go to Poland, Romania and Bulgaria to work so it evens out a little at least - unlike other countries.

&gt; This, this I can understand. Large, uncontrolled influxes of immigrants into a single country will cause this problem.

&gt; But we're 28 countries. Why are we not able to diffuse the immigrant population amongst all of our memberstates, using economic strength, size and population as metrics for who gets how much?

We're focusing the economic strength on the mediterranian countries currently.

A thing that's awful is that in Sweden we have segrigated areas where the government are afraid to enter, where our schools cannot teach certain things because they'll upset people and immigrated groups target minority groups because they have a conflict in their home countries or they believe different things. It's awful and not humane at all. Jews who are moving away because they don't feel safe is a huge problem, but these type of problems don't really happen in modern, rich and civilised societies right?

&gt; I'm not going to say they're heartless. That would be an exaggeration. But I'm not going to say that it's not flat out, a wrong thing to do and it is an extremely poor set of priorities we have if we're going to toss out people who can, in the long term, lead to a net contribution to the countries they both live in and the countries they are coming from, because some right wing parties have scared us with baseless rhetoric.

How long is ""long term""? Sweden currently has a loss from immigration and with segrigation and the unwillingness to educate oneself more it's going to take a very very long time for these people to actually contribute. It's a harsh truth but currently they're a drain on the welfare. Right winged parties have always exaggerated things but if you cannot seperate what is the truth and what is not you'll end up with a black and white view where you either don't believe any of the problems or believe all of them, and this is the worst type of scenario you can land on because they have to be either way wrong about everything or way right about everything for you to be right - and both parts are scary.

A report from Teori- og Metodecentret from 2006 found that seven out of ten young people placed on the secured youth institutions in Denmark are immigrants (with 40 percent of them being refugees).[7]

&gt;A 2006 study found that the share of immigrants has a positive and significant impact on the crime rate, confirming that a larger share of immigrants is associated with a higher crime rate. The data implies that this may be caused by the higher unemployment, and thus worse socioeconomic conditions among immigrants. However, unemployed persons born in France are still far less likely to commit crimes than unemployed recent immigrants.[11]

If the US Navy wasn't constantly doing this how long do you think it would be before piracy sprouted in other places of the world.  A couple of battle groups or a flight of SLBMS will not secure the worlds oceans you will need more ships and more importantly the ability to deploy them across the globe.  Otherwise international trade might come to a halt and Europe's economy will suffer.

What about regional powers like Iran, China, Russia, etc.  Yes Europe spends more than any one of these powers.  But does it have the capability to stop them from taking over or bullying their immediate rivals.  

The Tsunami in Japan disrupted production across the globe.  How do you think Europe's economy would fair if China decided to even the score with Japan, take over Taiwan or deny access to the South China Sea to her neighbors.  Imagine what any one of those conflicts would do to the global economy.

Could Europe intervene to stop this, does Europe have enough heavy lift capability to quickly move forces into the region to stabilize the situation or assist an ally?  Remember France one of your continents better military's couldn't deploy a small contingent of troops to Africa without US help.  Do you think Europe could project an entire Army on its own?

Granted I'm war gaming and these are all extreme ""what if"" scenarios but in this interconnected world if you don't have the ability to project force and protect your national interests abroad, you will find your economies and way of life threatened at home.  

The world has lived under Pax Britannia and then Pax Americana for almost two hundred years.  Old Regional disputes and wars while not entirely eliminated are not something the world has had to think about.  Some say WWI and WWII came about because of the power vacuum that existed between those two empires.  What could happen today without the presence of a single calming force on the world stage?  Europe could potentially fill that void, but it lacks the will power and the cohesiveness to do so.  I doubt it will attain either in at least a century.

I won't speculate on the intentions of the British public when voting on their MEPs.

If your MEPs are against further integration anyways, then I really don't see your point. They are free to vote for whatever they want regardless of their alliance.

On the question of British MEPs not representing the UK, I'll give you an analogy of my home country, which is a federal country: Our parliament is composed of two chambers, a national and a federal one. The national one is voted on in national elections and I do not expect a candidate I voted for to defend the interests of my home town, home region or home state, but my ideology and personal interests. The members of the federal chamber are sent in by the state parliaments and are there, at least in theory, to defend the interests of their home state.

Wait, what?? Don't they compliment each other?

Anyways, Sikorski is Polish and Americans love the Polish so it would work out between EU and NATO.

I mean Poland loves the whole democracy and liberty thing so it share that with the US (we all share his one)

But then Poland is also pretty darn Catholic and the US is still pretty darn Christian; so they share that value too.

And then they both like to be tough on their enemies, i.e. Russia. I kind of feel like Poland is to Russia what Japan is to China: a smaller, yet still formidable, country that is bolstered by American support.

IIRC The Polish have a concept called 'Polonia' which basically means that they continue cherish Americans of Polish descent and see them as having a special place in the Polish *ethnos*, despite not being fully culturally / linguistically Polish.

true,ImielinRocks,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Yeah, because integration worked so well with the other groups that have come here in the last 60 years.

It didn't? There are always some bad cases, but the vast majority seems to do just fine. I have quite a few of them as co-workers in the place I work (IT sector, so by now means ""lower-tier area""): English, French, Italian, Russian, Azerbaijan, Greek, ... They all seem to be doing fine.

Why limit yourself to the last 60 years only either? There was a huge influx of Polish/Silesian people in the 1880-ties and 1890-ties as well. I don't see their descendants being a huge problem (though to be fair, I never lived in the Ruhr area).

In the end, it's a case of having a fair measurement of how well those people integrate into the society, making them aware of the requirements, and sending those back who fail to make the effort.

&gt; You are aware that we do have a job deficit, especially in the lower-tier area, and you are aware that asylum seekers are banned from working here for some time?

For the last 25 years, I've *never* had a problem finding work. Neither did anyone in my family. And that's with the unemployment rate around here being 14.3% compared to the country's average of 6.6%. Sure, it might not have been the best job ever, and I might have need to move around the country for it (in one case 170 km; current job means I'm driving 90 km per day to and 90 km back from job; my brothers moved even farther away), but it paid my rent and bills. The ""job deficit"" is very much a solvable problem, especially for people willing to work.

And as with integration: If somebody is shown that they are *not* willing to work, they'll need to be expelled.

As for banning asylum seekers from working: I don't think it's a good and just law and I'm wondering why the BGH didn't overrule it yet.",0,1401347941,null,0,false,0,chtu0n4,t3_26pv81,t1_chtu0n4,t1_chttn2i,null,1434001602,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Commento a questa perchè ho visto il video da cui probabilmente è stata ""estratta"". Quello che diceva Farage è molto diverso - la discussione era fra una femministra oltraggiata che nella city di london le donne fossero ""discriminate"" perchè il salario medio delle donne per la stessa posizione degli uomini è inferiore. Farage diceva (correttamente) che la statistica presa così non ha senso perchè non include il fatto che in media le donne lavorano meno tempo degli uomini e per poter fare un paragone sensato è necessario prima normalizzare il salario alle ore lavorate.

Purtroppo questo toglie di credibilità anche a tutte le altre. Per il resto non so manco chi sia Farage, ho visto solo quel video. Però il *misquoting* è palese.

Finally, they need to learn the language and possibly learn to read as well. A teacher's salary around here is ~2000 €/month. Again, the average is probably lower than that so 1500 €/month.

true,rewboss,bavaria,Bayern,"Well, let's go through them one by one.

* Water: Yes, you're charged for water, and it's usually sparkling unless you specify otherwise. You may even be charged a small amount for tap water: Germans aren't used to people ordering or drinking tap water.
* Guten Appetit: In restaurants, I don't think you have to wait for everyone to get their food before you start. They do say ""Guten Appetit"", and actually it is one way of saying to somebody who already has their food before you do ""Go ahead, don't wait for me.""
* No free refills: This is true. The ""bottomless cup"" is an American idea.
* Taxes and tips: European countries have VAT, not sales tax, and VAT is always included in the retail price; but the amount of VAT you paid is always given on the receipt (important if you need to claim it back). Tipping is truly discretionary: if you don't think a tip is deserved, you don't tip. In Berlin the usual rate was 10%; out here in the country it's 5% to 10%. It's also done differently here: when the server tells you how much you owe, you hand over the cash and state how much you're paying (or ""Stimmt so"" to mean ""Keep the change""). The server then makes change as appropriate. You should never leave the tip on the table when you leave.
* Cash is king: Absolutely true, yes. Apart from anything else, you don't have the situation where the server takes your credit and disappears with it for several minutes.
* Lighting up: Smoking laws have been tightened up in the last few years. Mostly, smoking is allowed in cafés, bars, restaurants etc. only if there is a special room available which can be isolated from the rest of the establishment. Otherwise you have to go outside to smoke, although there isn't the requirement to stay at least so many yards away from the door. Drinking on the street doesn't usually have the same stigma attached to it as it does in the States, but some cities may have ""dry zones"" where it is actually forbidden. Traditionally, Germans drink very responsibly, but there does seem to have been a rise in binge drinking (""Komasaufen"") in recent years -- how much of that is reality and not tabloid hype I don't know, but it is a cause for concern.

Other things I would add to this list: In most places you don't need to wait to be seated; you're less likely to find the place full than you are in the States, but if you do you just leave and find a different place; once you have your food, wait staff will leave you alone unless you beckon them over, except to clear away the used plates; if you've ordered a salad with your meal it will normally be served first and you can choose whether to eat it as a starter or wait for the rest of the main course to arrive; wait staff don't engage in small talk with diners; if you want to pay you have to actually ask for the bill; your server will ask if one person is paying for everything (""zusammen"") or if you're all paying separately (""getrennt""); if you're paying separately, you tell the server what you're paying for and they add up what you owe; and once you've paid there's no pressure on you to leave immediately unless the place is crowded or about to close.",0,1401351361,null,0,false,0,chtumun,t3_26r055,t1_chtumun,t3_26r055,null,1434001899,16,false,SCHLAND,t5_2w5wj,16

Also there is the rich people from developing or ""rich-but-not-western"" countries, so rich indians, chinese, russians SA or qatari etc. They typically own an awful lot of stuff in France, and are concentrated in the south (thing Côte d'Azur), Paris or own châteaux and vineyard in the french countryside.

And of course, there is all the immigrants from the poor or developing countries so ex-french colonies from Asia of Africa, and other non ex-colonies like China, the countries in -stan etc. 

Just taking the exemple of the british : I live in a really small but somewhat ""bourgeois"" town (5000 inhabitants) in the Île-de-France, 30 kms from Paris, with absolutely nothing exceptionnal or even notable (there are historicals monuments, like a 1000 year old church, but british people have the same back in Britain, they're not the one impressed by this kind of stuff), and I regularly find myself surrounded by **only** british people, often with their children when I am just chilling with my friends in the local park. And whether it's on week days or week-end, it's always outside of holidays, french or british, i.e. they work and live there.
They typically are great people and are often willing to learn the language, which is cool since it's something that wouldn't be necessary for them, because you can easily get by with english and english is also the language used at their work.

There were fewer unemployed in Germany in May than in April.

The problem is that every year there are fewer unemployed in May than in April in Germany and in previous years that number was as high as 100,000.

The 24,000 number comes from trying to calculate the regular seasonal differences away.

This obviously won't work as well if there are fewer seasonal differences.

The milder winter means that the difference between the season was less server so there will naturally be a small seasonal upturn.

In total the number of those fully employed actually rose compared to last year and appears to continue to rise.

I can only give you a limited view from my working experience, since I moved south (Stuttgart) directly after receiving my degree. 
The area around Stuttgart is saturated with open job possibilites of all kinds. Just do a quick area search in Monster or Stepstone. Unemployment rate is really really low. 
A lot in jobs are in the industrial sector, automotive especially. So it depends on the skill set you bring to the table. 
In this area there are a lot of choices regarding job possibilities and carees, also payment. But with this come higher prices for living and a somewhat strikt recruiting process. 

Add a bit of strangeness (introverts with sometimes a heavy accent) into the mix and a lot of people shy away from moving to Baden Württemberg. But this is just a minor issue if one at all!


Do you have a formal training in some way or want to aquire one? This would be a big plus. 


As I mentioned I can only give you a glimpse from the situation around Stuttgart. Here are Mercedes and Porsches HQs so a lot of jobs either within those companies or external partners. Plus a ton of specialized companies in the machine building area.
A bit to the north, Waiblingen and Winnenden, there is Stihl, Kärcher, Bosch and Siemens, with a wide variety of job offerings. 

Construction companies are all around but that market is very fierce due to european competition. 


Another option would be to take part in one of the formal job training programms (Berufsausbildung) in one of the bigger companies. This way you would earn a really good degree and have a foot in the door or maybe even a job after the training. You will get paid and bigger companies ofter offer ""cheap"" housing for the trainees. Check out the site of the IHK www.ihk-lehrstellenboerse.de

The job situation in Germany is pretty good in general. A tad better in the South due to the big companies beeing located there. In Berlin it is a bit harder to find well paid jobs, likewise in the Ruhr-Gebiet (Dortmund, Düsseldorf) or Saarbrücken area but not impossible!

true,HighDagger,EURO,European Union,"&gt; What, in your opinion, is the ultimate goal of the pirate party?

• Transparent, corruption free politics with high engagement of the population in the political process.   

• Putting a halt and partly reversing the damage to privacy violations, offline as well as online.  

• Reform of the abomination that is intellectual property law, which has come to be used to stifle competition rather than promote it.  

• Promoting freedom and participation for everyone, to the best of the system's power - social liberalism - instead of mere absence of regulations (traditional liberalism).  

• Corruption free politics also means sound and honest policy on drugs: decriminalization, but taxation and regulation and thus proper government oversight and reduction in health risks through that.  

• Generally fact-oriented and functional politics. Together with transparency, reduction of corruption and engagement of the population, means things like opposing privatization where it makes sense (for example for infrastructure), and fighting against gentrification.

At the start, I had hopes that this kind of ""Sachorientiertheit"" (technocratic approach? dunno how to translate it properly) would extend to the Green boogeyman of nuclear power and GMOs as well and that we'd arrive at a sound energy policy without fomenting superstition and ignorance, but since most of the above goals coincide mostly with left/progressive elements of society and since those have in turn been represented and steered by the German Green movement, which has its roots in the Chernobyl case, it seems unavoidable that the party suffered a failure on this point. I find the others to still be mostly in tact though, which is why I haven't abandoned the party completely yet.  
Of course the first point has always been heavily bombarded and exploited by the press right from the start, which ultimately comes as no surprise either, given the state of things, but still wasn't something I had expected prior to actually witnessing it first hand. Before that, I didn't follow German media closely, nor did I ever scrutinize them to any significant extent, nor did I see them as as broken as they turned out to be. It's a flaw in the system, one that should have been prevented by publicly funded stations which would not have to rely on ad revenue. Which of course ended up to be a failure in its own right, and not safe from corruption either (see the money Lanz and Gottschalk got and compare it to how much actual journalism could have come from the same amount).

@Tweets, I'm saying that someone like Sevim doesn't fit anywhere. At least she shouldn't. Such clowns should have no place in any serious debate, in any role with authority, in any political party. But it is what it is. People are stuck between working all day and not having time to get informed, emotional reasoning, and ideology. Once again, it should be the job of the press to compensate for the lack of time of the common folk and investigate issues and then sum them up so that people can still be informed. Which is also not happening. And democracy relies on an educated electorate.

I already see my life being drained away by fighting trolls with information and my vote on reddit. You can have a look at my comment history if you want to see it for yourself. It's incredibly tiresome here, but it would be even more so with any German forum. Reach on an English website is better due to the larger user base and I get better efficiency on time invested. It's also in part due to me being incredibly disenfranchised with ""my people"". When I read ignorance in English, it could be from anywhere. When I see it in German, I'm confronted with the reality that people from the same place where I'm from are uninformed, yet arrogant enough that they defend and spread their misconceptions with no hesitation, everywhere they go. I'm German. I'm ""one of them"". It's unbearable. So I keep my distance - you've seen how strongly I reacted to the German dropbox content you linked...  
Furthermore, I also don't see the German political landscape changing much. It has been virtually the same for decades. Parties keep using the same lines, playing the exact same, predictable games, and all of them are full of shit. And on top of that, the strongest opposition movement runs on ignorance and paranoia, rallying against nuclear power while coal kills thousands of people every year and CO2 poisons the climate, and oil spills do their part. They may have good intentions, but the people they end up voting for know how to play on these fears.  
The only other possible opposition are protest voters, meaning extreme right or left wing populists - AfD and Linke.  
CDU is corruption. SPD is nothing. There's not a single political party with its main focus on actually solving issues. All of them are playing the voters, and playing games. And the only alternative that could have been there was DESTROYED by a media apparatus that has been corrupted from its journalistic roots to become profit making machines themselves, always listening to public opinion to get those views with the currently hot topics, high emotions, and least amount of work necessary.

So all I do is laugh about Green voters, discard Lefties and populists whenever I see them, and vote and voice my support for Pirates whenever I can. I'm no leader either. The very idea of leading people is alien to me personally. Who is to say that the Pirates are *my* party and not the one of all the others?  

So what would you have me do? I hate working with people. I'm probably the most misanthropic and society hating person you can find. Humans suck, big time, and they're proud of it, too.

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"&gt; Violence without a political point to it is more likely to be immoral.

I think this is a very difficult philosophcal position to defend. You are essentially objectifying the well-being of individuals when put into contrast with some ""greater good"". That, to me, is the very beginning of most of the suffering in this world, and I will stand against this and will speak out against this whenever I can.

You are able to attach differing values of usefulness to violence. Killing a serial rapist and killing an innocent child are both taking the life away from a human being, but most people will attribute a certain amount of usefulness to the first. 

But just because something is more useful doesn't make it less immoral. In a similar sense, just because something is less harmful doesn't make it less immoral. The mistake is in believing that usefulness and morality are neccessarily linked.

You can of course take this stance, this is up to you to decide. But it does mean that you begin to evaluate ethics on the grounds of their relative utility. 

But how to you evaluate? What's your metric?

And then, I ask you, what safeguards you from doing the ""right"" evaluation? To not fall into the always-present danger of personal bias and intellectual dishonesty which will twist your greater good and in the end serve a common evil?

A cynic might say that there is no evil - there are only people believing that they work for the greater good. It just happens that one greater good looks evil in the eyes of another. If you make statements like the above, it doesn't take long to fall into the trap of one.

&gt;As a liberal you could at least entertain the thought of which of these 2 sides fighting is defending liberal society and which is pursuing something completely different

I don't care who defends ""liberal society"", whatever that is. I see violence, and I dislike it equally because it closes the door to more civilised behaviour.

The rest of your post shows that you believe we are in some grand historical struggle against other ideologies that you deem to have agency all by itself, although the human actors might change. 

I do not share this point of view. I see human beings, and I see the problem of extremism as a social problem. But I refuse to be made a soldier in some war. There are extremist elements in society, I do not believe that ignoring one type of extremism is going to curb another type - be it left, centre or right.",0,1401353826,null,0,false,0,chtv16b,t3_26opnp,t1_chtv16b,t1_chtuimr,null,1434002099,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Plus, the EP can decided to block other projects as revenge. Maybe projects important to Cameron, I'm sure there's something.

I agree, Cameron's strategy here is unlikely not to work in relation to the Commission President. These negotiations are just an ongoing part of Cameron's efforts to build alliances - key to whether or not the UK stays in the EU.

But this is still extremely interesting because Cameron's main strategy here is to build alliances on people that want to reform the EU in his direction, for a renegotiation beginning after the next UK general election. Quite often the UK is peceived as being in a minority of one. In actual fact, there are many other governments that are sympathetic to the UK government position (but less keen to be seen to say it).

A common European course concerning refugees is our best chance to control the refugee situation and the costs it creates. If we leave the Mediterranean countries alone with the problem, they will be overburdened with the situation, which will lead to consequences for all of us.

The perception of the public is ""open borders = we aren't save anymore!"". But that is wrong. First of all, the borders are closed for these people, so Schengen doesn't have much to do with the problem. And secondly these people simply don't care about borders. They have fled war, prosecution, poverty and hunger and they have crossed the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe. A turnpike at the Italian-Austrian border won't stop from reaching Austria.

Oh, sure, without the EU it would be much easier for you to ignore Human rights and the background noise created by the United Nations and pissed off Human rights organizations. But you would still have to deal with the refugees, and you would still have costs for dealing with them. And without a common European strategy there would be much more refugees seeking asylum in the EU. A European strategy is cheaper for all of us than letting every country deal with the problem on its own.

Like I said above, there are ""only"" 300,000 refugees coming every year, and they create costs of less than 0,1 percent of our GDP. That hardly justifies ignoring our commitment to the Human rights charter or loosing our minds and voting for right wing populists. There are much, much more important topics to discuss.

On your second explanation thats actually a rather intriguing one. I suppose it didn't really occur to me as in the UK MPs fill both roles.

Check www.monster.de and www.stepstone.de for job offerings and decide for youreself. Then check http://www.immobilienscout24.de/ for rental prices in that area, or http://www.wg-gesucht.de/.

Public transportation is really not an issue in any of those cities. 

I can give you a small example. Working as a good skilled mechanic in a medium sized special production company in Stuttgart will give you around 3500€ p.M. Depending on your fiscal situation that will give you roughly 2000€ or more after taxes. 
If you live in the outskirds (e.g. Waiblingen, Esslingen, Ludwigsburg) you have excellent public transportation and the rent is a bit lower.     A 2 bedroom apartment (55-70sqm) will set you back around 650-750€ + utilities so roughly 780-880€. 
Public transportation is not cheap either, so that will be another 100€Plus depending how far away you live.

Tu connais sa stratégie de recrutement ? Le service qu'elle offre précisément ? La façon dont le marché se régule à ce niveau ? Les prestations de service offertes par cette association ?

Encore une fois : on est pas payé au ""capital humain"" (qui s'apprécie aussi par la correspondance des compétences par rapport aux besoins sur le marché...), mais selon une offre et une demande, dans une économie de marché. 

Le Grand Méchant Marché, ce n'est pas une dizaine de types autour d'une table qui fixe ce que valent X années d'études, Y années d'expériences, etc. contrairement à une économie planifiée (ou au fonctionnariat en France).

Ce dirigeant d'association n'a pas que ce que ""valent"" les études du salarié en tête. Il doit avoir des tonnes d'autres choses en tête. Tu ne connais même pas la finalité de ce job ; peut-être qu'il ne demande que peu d'expérience et de compétences au final.

Peut-être que le mec se plante ; et alors ? On ne peut le savoir à l'avance à partir d'une simple donnée sur les salaires. Un ""bon"" entrepreneur pourrait voir l'abondance de profils ""psycho-""/""socio-"" sur le marché du travail comme l'opportunité d'avoir une main-d’œuvre spécialisée pas chère. Et mettrait sur plan une activité à partir de cette donnée, la faisant peut-être même correspondre à des besoins qui n'avaient jusqu'à présent pas émergés. Un très mauvais entrepreneur pourrait aussi rassembler les gens les plus qualifiés/compétents du monde et faire de la merde. Mais ce n'est pas sur une simple annonce que tu peux juger des compétences du patron.

Cela peut être aussi une stratégie bête et méchante, très simple : être très exigeant, assouplir par la suite ses demandes, ou alors augmenter le salaire s'il tombe sur quelqu'un de très performant. Ou alors il est fauché et son association aussi. Ou alors il ne cherche pas la Perle, le Meilleur Psychologue de France, mais juste quelqu'un sachant faire de ""l'écoute"" (?).

true,HugodeCrevellier,EURO,Frank Reich,"And yet the FN came first. Why? Well, let's start with Schäuble's idiotic '*'fascist and extremist*' statement. This is explainable in historical terms: 

Pre-WWII Nazi racist ideology, especially *anti-Semitism*, led to the unspeakable wartime horrors of the concentration camps.

Because of this, European politicians are terrified of being perceived as racist or in any way similar to the Nazis of the past century.

This means that they're for example afraid to raise the issue of mass Islamic immigration into Europe. And, as they won't raise it themselves, they'll also immediately label anyone daring to be concerned by it, as being  ... *unabashedly racist xenophobic scapegoating fascists* or whatever. Buzzwords like '*Islamophobia*' (a bullshit term) fly around. 

But here's the thing: Mass Islamic immigration into Europe **is** a problem. Not only are Muslims not becoming less Islamic and more secular '*Europeans*', they show every sign of wanting to turn the tables around, seeking to instead make Europe more Islamic, and actually appearing to succeed in that. 

And most politicians do not dare confront this issue, for fear of the '*Islamophobia*' label. 

Given this bizarre situation, many people, especially on the traditional left, have nowhere to turn. And paradoxically, if only for addressing an obviously important issue (which is avoided as *taboo* by everyone but the FN), the FN, no matter its faults, appear as the only sane political party!
