false,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"It depends what you're looking for, but in terms of English speaking undergraduate degrees, Scotland is free for EU citizens and, with respect, they tend to rank higher than Portuguese institutions, so that might be an option you might want to look in to. Secondly, when it comes to your masters degrees, a lot of Universities throughout the EU teach in English and are free. If money is an issue, it doesn't follow that you have to be stuck in Portugal. (And even the most expensive tuition in the EU is still only going to be a third of the costs in Australia e.g. £21k GBP instead of £90k GBP in Aus. )

So, if I were an English-speaking EU citizen who was not enamoured with the choices my country offered, and spoke no other language than my native one, I'd be looking at studying in Scotland, followed by a free Masters degree from some other institution in Northern Europe. If I decided part way through my (science-only) course that I wanted to stay in Scotland, I would consider changing from Bachelors to integrated Masters, and graduate after five years with and MSc rather than four years with a BSc.

&gt;There were WMDs in Iraq. Saddam was regularly trying to make things difficult on weapons inspectors and would fire on planes in the no fly zone he agreed to.Of course it wasn't anywhere close to the threat being put forth by Bush though. And I personally don't think it was worth it with the lack of planning for the aftermath.

Where have you lived for the past ten years?

&gt;During the lead-up to war in March 2003, United Nations weapons inspector Hans Blix said that Iraq made significant progress toward resolving open issues of disarmament noting the ""proactive"" but not always ""immediate"" cooperation as called for by UN Security Council Resolution 1441. He concluded that it would take “but months” to resolve the key remaining disarmament tasks.[5]

Not to mention that it was proven that Iraq had *no WMDs whatsoever*!

&gt;UN is also a useless organization for some things

Do you understand why UN exists? To force countries to resolve issues peacefully, to preserve the sovereignty of countries and to stop anyone from asserting their ""values"" will-nilly on the rest of the globe. Not to mention that there is something seriously wrong with your ""values"" if you need to spread them using military action against nations that can't defend themselves.

And who the fuck are you to go above the rest of the world?

&gt; Serbia could have been dropping nukes on Kosovo and it could still be blocked by UN if Russia used their veto.

First off, that's bullshit. Second, that's the purpose of UN. So you can't do shit without the agreement of the rest of the world. If you honor democratic principles on an individual level, honor them on the international level, too.

Baltic Russians are mostly immigrants of a few decades planted during illegal occupation. Most of them have no roots here. Besides, as not many are willing to learn the local languages now, we could be sure that they wouldn't even consider it if Russian was an official language. But language is the key element to integration, we've seen that.

I don't understand how you call chauvinism that tiny Baltic nations are unwilling to split their already small countries between them and migrants, who already have the largest country on Earth.

Anyway, I have a solution for those refusing to learn the official languages of Baltics and demanding privileges. Just move to Russia. The country where they came from.

And that is true. The simple fact is that Iran is not an alternative for a sudden stop of Russian gas because Iran *couldn't* export gas to the EU - because there are no pipelines to do that. But Iran has expressed interest for such pipeline project. And if the relevant pipeline gets built then Iran would be not only an alternartive but a *direct competitor* to Russian gas.

Just because something is not written down and legally binding doesn't mean you're not supposed to honor it.

The article obviously shows that verbal assurance were given to Moscow.

There is a big difference between referendum observers and military observers. No one in their right mind would invite foreign observers to examine their military during war time.

But referendum observers were invited by Russians. To observe *the referendum*, which OSCE refused. But they send military observers to gather intelligence on the military? Of course they turned those away.

false,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and St Andrews are expensive places to live. Dundee is cheap. Glasgow is middle of the road. Stirling would probably be somewhere in the middle too. 

Glasgow has the best night life. Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee have decent night life. St Andrews is small but enough to get by. I imagine Stirling's is quite poor. 

I guess if you've looked in to it you'll be aware that you need to apply via UCAS. You'll also be aware that you'll only be able to pick five courses. Given the modular system in Scotland, it'd be a bit of a waste to apply more than once to the same University, as you should be able to internally transfer so long as you continue to meet requirements (at least in St Andrews, though it's not likely to be too different elsewhere). The personal statement you fill in is important, spend some time on it. The deadlines will be available on UCAS's website, but check those yourself. The earlier you apply, the better, since applications are on a rolling basis. 

Course requirements will be online in the prospecti from each university, but if you have any questions you should be able to contact an admissions officer at the University, especially if you didn't study the IB or some other course which will be well-known in Scotland (e.g. A levels).

To get your fees paid, you'll need to apply to SAAS. The Scottish Government will not giving you living support, though if the Danish government is like the Swedish government, they will likely provide you with living support even outwith the country. You'll need to submit the application form every year. 

The first year in Scotland tends to only be marginally higher than what are known as Advanced Highers, the most difficult high school qualification you can get. If your grades in those are good enough, you should be able to get direct entry to second year and shorten your time of study. Similarly, good IB or A level grades should allow that too. You can choose not to go down that route. 

In terms of accommodation, a lot of Universities will probably guarantee you halls for first year (sometimes with the caveat that you live a certain distance away). In St Andrews, those would be a good way to meet people since almost everyone goes in to them. I'd imagine it's pretty similar at the other universities. You might want to look into private halls of residences in the bigger cities since they can be cheaper/nicer. After that, you're likely to be on your own when it comes to accommodation.

The Student Union will probably give out advice on finding accommodation. The long and short of it is, if you will be living in a flat with more than three people in it, the flat will need to be HMO licensed. As someone not from the UK, you might be expected to pay a larger deposit than people from the UK. Any deposit you pay, the landlord must deposit in to a 'deposit protection scheme' which will protect you from bad landlords scamming you for that. When you move in to a new flat, remember to call up the electricity/gas company and tell them you're taking on the lease. If you're allow, shop around for the best prices. Set up a direct debit to pay as you'll usually get a discount. 

If you lvie in student halls or an HMO flat, any adaptor you use for power will need to be fused. 

There will be open days, which might be advisable for you to come to. If there are many you'd like to visit, but the dates don't add up, some offer the ability to do individual visiting days, so you can pad a week's trip out or something. 

It's kind of difficult to know what challenges you're likely to face, since coming from an other country adds another layer and it's difficult to know what is 'non-obvious' but tonnes of people manage every year with little to no guidance. You'll probably be able to wing it, once you're in. ",0,1412199482,null,0,false,0,ckxufyj,t3_2hzqsf,t1_ckxufyj,t1_ckxtdlm,null,1426730648,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

That is why a country's sovereignty has to be respected, i.e. why it must never be broken without the approval of the UN, because otherwise we descend into chaos.

I wouldn't be getting mad about all this so much, if the U.S. wasn't so hypocritical.

OK one last try, really simplified down:

A war is either good or bad. If good, allies should help, if bad, the country is bad. If it is bad, better not ally. If it is actually good, but nevertheless allies are so distrustful that they not believe it is good, better not ally because lack of trust is not really a good basis for that. In that case they are bad for not trusting in what is a good case. At any case, not a good marriage.

Clear now finally?

Maybe another parallel: if I you are my business partner, and I steal from you, better not be my business partner. If I don't steal from you, but you believe I did, again better not be my business partner because an unreasonable distrust is not a good basis for it. Either way - does not matter which side is wrong - if there is no strong trust and support, better go your own way. Clear now?

&gt; There is a big difference between referendum observers and military observers. No one in their right mind would invite foreign observers to examine their military during war time.

This distinction does absolutely nothing to help validate the sham referendum.

&gt; But referendum observers were invited by Russians. To observe the referendum, which OSCE refused. But they send military observers to gather intelligence on the military? Of course they turned those away.

[They didn't refuse it for no reason, fella, includng the invading army's inability to guarantee their safety](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_referendum,_2014#OSCE_and_UN_absence).

&gt; According to that, any trade deal is coercion according to you, including the Ukraine-EU association agreement.

No, the EU does not supply Ukraine with energy and did not repeatedly threaten to and then act on shutting it off. This is aside from literally buying Yanukovych to right pro-Russian policy.

He also called our language ""Mexican.""  Linguistic purism is a known feature of Castilla y Leon (actual, linguistic realities aside).  The officer was denigrating us based on the form of Spanish he thought we would be likely to speak, based on his perception of where we were from, regardless of the fact that he was actually speaking with us at that moment, and our Spanish was, in fact, Castillian.  I had never even been to any Spanish-speaking country other than Spain at that point.

Weil es zur persönlichen Freiheit eines jeden von uns gehört alles in unseren Körper zu tun was uns beliebt. Es ist unser Körper und wir sind die einzigen, die darüber zu entscheiden haben was wir ihm zuführen. Der Staat hat uns da weder zu bevormunden, noch hat er so zu tun als wüsste er was besser für uns ist.

Zu den Grünen muss ich jetzt wohl erklären, dass längst nicht alles was die sich so wünschen falsch ist, sie gehen es nur völlig falsch an.
Ein Beispiel sind die Verbote von alles und jedem. Wenn ich will, dass andere Menschen etwas nicht mehr tun, dann stell ich das zur Debatte, erkläre warum es besser ist dies nicht mehr zu tun und gehe mit gutem Vorbild voran. Ich zwinge niemanden über ein Verbot, sondern führe durch Vorbild. 

Ich bin nämlich selber grüner als die meisten hier annehmen. Kaufe fast nur Bio, bin mehr Veganer als Vegetarier, trenne meinen Müll, fahr viel mit dem Rad und ÖPNV, etc.

Ich würde mich aber nie hinstellen und jemandem sagen ""Ey, du darfst das nicht, weil ich der Meinung bin das sei schlecht für dich."" Nie!

Auch hier kritisiere ich wie die Grünen die Legalisierung angehen. Das schadet der ganzen Sache so stümperhaft gehen die da ran. Genau so wie die Piraten mit Grumpy Cat und Gebt das Hanf frei.

Kein Mensch identifiziert sich mit diesen Stonern oder anderen Bekloppten, wohl aber ist denen nahe zu bringen, dass Betäubungsmittelkonsum zur persönlichen Freiheit eines jeden Menschen gehört. Das verstehen selbst die Konservativen, denn gegen Freiheit will auch dort keiner sein.

Das zieht sich übrigens durch viele Anliegen. Wenn ich mit den Prolifern in meiner Umgebung spreche, argumentiere ich auch immer mit der persönlichen Freiheit der Frau, ein Recht was ihr schlicht zusteht. Ich respektiere die Meinung, dass manch einer der Ansicht ist, Glibber sei bereits Leben, aber auch der versteht meist, dass die Freiheit der Frau darüber steht und es keinesfalls von Vorteil ist, ein ungewolltes Kind in der Welt zu haben. Dies versteht der aber nur so lange bis die Femifaschisten um die Ecke springen, ihm Vaginaplätzchen hinterherschmeißen und brüllen ""MEINE FOTZE GEHÖRT MIR!""

Now the only weak point of Russia is West Russia with what they call the European Plains - IE. a choke point where mountains give way to open plains.

Anyway - the guy explains it better than me and it starts at around 3:50 with a picture of europe showing the terrain of russias western border. 

Where the russia (USSR) border has been pushed back and where Russias border needs to be in order to have any chance at being a super power is pretty much west of the Baltics because otherwise it won't be able to defend itself if Russia finally decides to go fishing and start a war with NATO.

And the West broke the memo first by supporting the protesters, threatening sanctions to Yanukovych and dealing with (according to Ukrainian constitution) illegal interim govt of Ukraine.

Second, the West shouldn't have given assurances it couldn't keep — such as NATO non-expansion.

&gt;This distinction does absolutely nothing to help validate the sham referendum.

You claimed that Russians turned away OSCE, which is a blatant lie, and the distinction is very, very important. If only OSCE didn't refuse to monitor the referendum, we would have known whether it really was a sham or not. Or we could just watch interviews conducted in the post-annexation Crimea to see what is the general attitude towards being part of Russia.

&gt;They didn't refuse it for no reason, fella, includng the invading army's inability to guarantee their safety. The OSCE are an independant body. You can't accuse them of ""gathering intelligence on the military"" for use by some nebulous opposing force just because yours is the military under the spotlight this time.

I see no mention of ""inability to guarantee their safety"" mentioned in the article.

Let's say the weren't gathering intelligence. The point still stands that they refused to monitor the referendum (because the vote would obviously be for joining Russia, albeit not 90%), but they wanted to inspect the military.

As a very, very rough ballpark, let's say that 8km of bridge costs the same as 1km of tunnel and that costs can be multiplied up, so the new link would be roughly ten times the cost; ~US$57bn in 2000's money, or roughly US$74-93bn in today's money using the [tool here](http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/relativevalue.php) to estimate current value.  Call it US$83bn.

I've shown you how you are wrong and cited sources on it. Russia has tried to manipulate Ukraine through energy politics, displays of force and outright purchase of Ukranian polticians since the failure of the USSR. That is literally it. You are making poor excuses for a needless invasion of your neighbour, and those excuses still don't in anyway make sense in reality.

&gt; Second, the West shouldn't have given assurances it couldn't keep — such as NATO non-expansion.

It didn't.

&gt; You claimed that Russians turned away OSCE, which is a blatant lie

It did.

&gt; If only OSCE didn't refuse to monitor the referendum, we would have known whether it really was a sham or not. 

If you, *defending the invasion*, have to say this, what does that say about the referendum? **If the Ukranian people really wanted to join Russia, why couldn't the referendum wait? Why didn't the referendum offer an option to maintain the status quo?**

&gt; I see no mention of ""inability to guarantee their safety"" mentioned in the article.

&gt; Uninvited OSCE military observers attempted to enter the region four times but were turned away, **sometimes after warning shots were fired,[95][96] which was another reason given for not dispatching referendum observers**

They were literally shooting at impartial observers. That's like a big red sign saying ""We're probably the bad guys, here.""

&gt; Let's say the weren't gathering intelligence.

They're impartial observers. *Who would they be gathering it for??*

Okay, if you are really admitting you lack the brainpower to work this one out, I'll explain it like I would to a highschool politics student.

When they pass pro-EU legislation, or make policy movements that you don't agree with, you threaten to increase the price, which you know they can't afford, threaten to shut it off, resulting in death, or actually shut it off, resulting in death.

I know you know this, and I know you are only saying you don't because we are talking about Russia doing it. If we were talking about the US playing energy politics, I'm sure I'd find you an expert. Duplicity like this is why Russian posters are losing face on these forums.

There's a road to Åland already, though about 25 kilometres of it is covered by government-funded barges. About 5 kilometres of that is probably cheaper to just build bridges instead (they're just short island hops), but there's some sort of strange budget reason why they operate barges instead. 

The rest 20 kilometres.. I don't know. I think most of the water between the smaller islands is pretty swallow, so bridges should be possible at least some of the time. The 10 kilometres between Åland and Turku Archipelago looks pretty deep, though. 

It's another 30 kilometres from Åland to Sweden and there are no isles in-between (the main reason why Åland belongs to Finland). To that part, you would have to build a tunnel.

You claim that our racism is rooted in the US society, but you think its less racist to call someone a N__ than not call someone a N__ simply because you think we have ""legal"" racism? Without any data to back it up how can you say that your police aren't just as racist if not worse? I tried to get stats on the demographic of your prisons and was unable to find anything. They just say that there are a lot of foreigners. In the US the reason so many blacks are in prison is because of the ""war on drugs"" and police profiling blacks in urban environments where they sell it as one of the only means to make a living. The majority of prisoners are still white (http://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_race.jsp). 

You say that the worst part of racism is one that is rooted in society and yet at the same time you seem to ignore that in Spain people will commonly use the ""N"" word as though there's nothing wrong with it. How many Moroccan and other Subsaharan African immigrants are mistreated because of their skin color. When Blacks in America go on vacation abroad Spain is one of the top countries they are told to watch out for. They warn each other about it. I love Spain and both my parents were born there, but that doesn't change that for as kind and welcoming as Spaniards have been to me I have heard tons of them speak racistly about blacks and jews and attribute broad stereotypes any time they see just one black or jewish person do something that they dislike.

The concept refers to the changes that were made to the status of soldiers in german law. Soldiers were granted certain civic rights which they didn't have prior to 1945. Voting rights and rights to unionize, for example.

The concept has frequently been derided as producing civilians in military garb. Part time soldiers that work their 9-5 shifts. A bit like I imagine your national guard.

Let's not forget BND spied on the likes of Turkey, Hillary Clinton and others.



&gt;And your economic destiny is less connected to the other european countries. We're supposed to become a federal state, and you clearly don't want.

I take it Denmark is also included in that? I know /r/europe is looking forward to federalisation and going on about it daily but I've not seen the same enthusiasm for it reflected in the actual European population. 

&gt;Maybe it was the narrative he told you, but here, all the medias mention the fact that Cameron think that Juncker is too pro-federalism.

Too pro-federalized = someone he thought he couldn't work with. 

&gt;Ok, so you just admit what I said since the beginning: britons feel closer to the US. French are also more than aware of how they are disliked by others in Europe, to be close to another non-EU country is just not an option.

It's the first time I've heard of France being disliked by others in Europe though, and they are far more likely to view the EU in a positive light (38% FR vs. 23% UK). 

It makes sense for the UK to feel closer to the US when they're disliked by Europe, don't particularly feel strong ties to Europe or the EU and have a strong history and cultural ties with the US.

Rather, many opposed it because they saw practically all the benefits in terms of prestige, infrastructure, promotion etc only going to Oslo and the immediate surrounding area, and people living elsewhere in the country had no interest in supporting that both in general, and especially after the government refused to support Tromsø's bid for 2018.

Of course, that in and of itself could be worked around. Unless you were from Tromsø and the surrounding area, most people weren't terribly set in their opinions and could probably have been convinced otherwise with the right marketing. Unfortunately the pro-Olympics marketing in Norway has been completely dreadful, alienating people at every turn and failing to drum up excitement up into the last few, important, weeks, and it kept getting worse.

Finally, the IOC have been absolutely terrible for the Norwegian pro-Olympics committee to deal with, because any newspaper wishing to cover the Olympics bid barely even have to go on google to find juicy stuff to write sensational articles about corruption or what-have-you. Combine it with their ludicrous (to the uninformed, anyone following the IOC or hell, FIFA's demands in recent years wouldn't be very surprised) list of demands thrown front and center into every news-source in the country, and the bid stood little chance. Combining general distaste for the ostentatious among Norwegians, its complete contrast to the promises that mainly got our current ruling coalition into power (fiscal responsibility), and some particularly ill-conceived demands like their own lanes on the roads (Oslo doesn't have enough of them to actually accommodate that even were people willing to try) or demanding a party with the King at his or our Olympic committee's expense, and people are basically hating the IOC right now. Other than some winter-sports celebrities you're hard pressed to see anyone comment on this beyond praising the decision or attacking the IOC as corrupt leeches destroying the spirit of the Olympics and calling for them to change their ways.

I wonder to what extent in the context ""being connected to central Europe"" the choice between two routes matters. I mean, on the one hand, you have the Baltic way.

On the other hand, a straight route towards Stockholm will bring you in the ""rich and prosperous"" realm way quicker. 

That said, we don't know how Europe looks like once these programs would hypothetically be finished, especially with Poland and the Baltics having quite some potential. Furthermore, Stockholm is the far edge of this realm, whereas entering from Poland, you're more centralized, which offers its advantages.

Were it not for CCPA's, Public Citizen, TNI, and a few other NGOs, well written pubs, I would not know this issue existed.

 I discovered quite a bit from the CCPA and Public Citizen pubs. 

So many things that are going on in US politics at their core relate to trade policy but that fact is aggressively hidden. 

Its a crime how much we are being deceived. In the US, there is NEVER any mention of the underlying loss of policy space caused by FTAs. 

Never. So, that omission literally turns every politician into a liar. Because they all pretend there are other reasons for things- reasons that in all probability are just made up. For example, GATS's standstill has blocked public services since 1998. Only trade experts know that. That lack of knowledge enables a lot of dishonest behavior.

&gt;

&gt;The __Twelve Grapes__ ([Sp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language). *Las doce uvas de la suerte*, ""The twelve grapes of luck"") is a [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain) tradition that dates back from at least 1895  but became established in 1909. In December of that year, some [alicantese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicante) vine growers popularized this custom to better sell huge amounts of [grapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape) from an excellent harvest.

&gt;The tradition consists of eating a grape with each [bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_(instrument\)) strike at midnight of December 31 with our families. According to the tradition, that leads to a year of prosperity.  In some areas, it is believed that the tradition wards away witches and general evil.  

&gt;The twelve grapes are linked to the [Puerta del Sol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerta_del_Sol) tower clock, where this tradition started and from where the change of year is always broadcast.

It's much better to fix the world.

Because when I look at [eurozone's GDP](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/uk-us-eurozone.png), I don't see any extra growth that the euro could have given. (and we could also talk of the 11.5% unemployment rate, the low inflation etc.)

This managed to annoy me, however not due to the intended - by now rather stale - joke of 'Germany being frightening'. Heinrich Heine lived in exile in France because his highly satirical works made him an unwanted man in his home country of, you guessed it, Germany. The fact that he cannot sleep at night thinking of Germany isn't because he's afraid, but because he has *Heimweh*, i.e. he misses his home with all his soul, and is worried about its future. He loves his home with all his heart - not really the kind of quote you'd like to use when you try to insult a place.

So the quote intended to piss off Germans really does work (yours truly is an example), but rather for a different reason. It's like quoting ""Blood, toil, tears and sweat"" and interpreting it as if Churchill was advocating appeasment because it was going to be a difficult road ahead. It works to piss off people, but so does stating that the sun revolves around the Earth. It's your own stupidity which annoys them, not the content of the quote. And that says more about you than anything else.

States are the basis for the UN system, the principles on it refer to the non-interference with internal affairs, territorial integrity, and so on. The Security Council can act when states violate these principles causing a problem for international peace and security.

The principle of self-determination is recognised by the Charter, but it doesn't entail the right to unilaterally secede.

From wikipedia article on self-determination (I can get better sources if you like, but this was most easily obtained):

&gt; According to the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, the UN, ICJ and international law experts, there is no contradiction between the principles of self-determination and territorial integrity, with the latter taking precedence. 

Self-determination can take place through representation within a larger state, for example, like Cataluña's case whereby they are constituted as an autonomous community. Other principles like uti possidetis iuris further curtail the principle of self-determination in order to preserve fixity of borders and reduce conflict.

The closest one can get to support for this position is the ICJ's Kosovo ruling, which stated that Kosovo's declaration of independence was not contrary to law (note it did not also state that Serbia was in any way obliged to grant it independence).

Transition from serfdom to freedom is certainly quick and easy on paper, but in real life is a huge psychological change. In Europe similar transitions were more gradual, whereas in Russia it was quite sudden and ""driven from above"". The typical late 19th century Russian conservative argument is that such sudden change broke the peasants' ""natural connection"" to the idea of Russia or some such fluffy stuff, which is the root cause of their radicalism - they weren't properly guided to their new, somewhat less slave-like state in the Russian absolute monarchy's social hierarchy, so they got uppity and took things too far in 1917.

Quickest way to piss off most Maltese?

Migration. Perfect topic to rile people up. In general, people misinterpret the position of migrants in society, are fearful of what might or might not happen down the line and, despite their passion for the subject, don't know a practical answer for their anxieties. 

Ignorance, fear and helplessness; the simplest mix to start something everyone will regret down the line. Or just something to laugh about from afar on the internet.

However.. 

I'm not sure what your opinion on the matter is. You start off by saying, basically, *somewhat right* and *somewhat wrong*, in attaching certain post-war decisions on school curriculum to 'americans'. First, you only listed the *somewhat right* parts, and I don't know what you *don't* like. 

Furthermore, I'm not at all sure about what you're implying - what, that if it wasn't for the post-WW2 're-education' curriculum, certainly at least approved by the US (the UK has lost its power by now), that Germans wouldn't have a guilt-complex about WW2? Or, to a lesser degree? Or what?

My point is, that while you have a good teacher (like I did for most of it) there will be lots of thoughtfull discussion and interesting points of view will be brought up, because he sees his students as beeing capable of thinking for themselfs.

If you have a bad teacher tho (like I did for one year) you will be indoctrinated with it, thinking outside exactly what the text says is basically beeing a nazi yourself etc. etc.

And quite frankly there are more bad than good teachers our there.

So large chunks of the german public have been indoctrinated that germany is the worst at ever leading and that inside we are basically horrible human beeings that when given the chance will try to kill everyone.

Germany should never be in any position of leadership and germany should enver be proud of beeing germany, if you get indoctrinated with that from a very young age it can understandably be really really hard for you to want more military power and more active leadership of germany, the whole WW2 fear complex gets even worse!

Btw that doesn't mean that people like me don't acknowledge our past, I too don't want germany to become this big giant leader, I want us to help, and I think because of our past which exists so we have to deal with it, we even have the responsibility to help so we should increase our military spending to a point where we are not useless like right now.

false,WilliamDhalgren,CROA,Croatia,"Uhm, I'd agree were it practically any other country but here?

1) if EDP procedure now doesn't punish them with at least an interest-bearing deposit, countries like Spain and Portugal are right to complain of a double standard. They've already been given (sensible) extensions to produce a downward path to their deficit. Min fine is 4billion euro. Not a scenario anyone desires for an already struggling economy, since it hardly helps. But this is a community of law, not one run by the market. It would be much easier to avoid were they persuasive in the commitment to some reforms at least. 

2) France has repeatedly promised and failed to put its deficit on a downwards trajectory, be it by austerity or by boosting growth or However. Whatever France has been doing, it hasn't shown any results in the last 7 years and is set to continue for another one. It's not a case of focusing on the short run with overly aggressive targets and incorrect policies (cuts) to achieve it and the like. By now, this damages the credibility of its medium-term commitment; IDK if a single country did less than France to tackle its long-term debt trajectory in the past decade. I'd rather see Italy spending more than France. Anyone really, apart prob Greece.

3) Nevermind the damage of credibility of the rules - a symptom rather than a disease, though a dangerous one - its that their economic policy is apparently impotent to do anything about the pathetic economic results. They're showing a deeper hole due to a further fall in revenue, not due to the aggressiveness of the expenses (say, in order to boost growth and hence revenue). With a long-stagnant economy, its not that they're not implementing a particular kind of policy, like austerity - they've not produced any ambitious economic policies; the political class seems to be merely trying and failing to implement austerity cuts. This looks set to say ""no reform"" - rather than just ""no austerity"". A lack of economic strategy or the power to implement any. This certainly destroys business and consumer confidence necessary for any kind of recovery.

ahh, you can - strategy there is improving your competitiveness by internal depreciation, similarly to how you would have depreciated the currency before the monetary union - it will just hurt more. See the recently linked Stiglitz article - recessions find a bottom, so a fair number of austerity-minded states found it, fairly deeply down, and have been deemed a success. Ofc only if one doesn't consider the price of getting there.

But looking at even those cases from a perspective of a country in a recession for 6 years now, and with an economy that has overall stagnated since before I was born 30+ years ago essentially, frankly I envy even finding a bottom in such a painful way. All that tried even THAT, at least did get to the bottom  by now. We might next year just barely, tough the projection risks are on the downside... which is to say no clear end in sight yet.. 

Its one thing to recommend growth-boosting policies rather than internal depreciation via cuts, another to simply continue to be economically unattractive while maintaining expenditure and revenue status quo. I think that's gotta be the worst possible economic policy, even compared to austerty. 

And I wouldn't ignore the Keynesian ""animal spirits"" that drive the markets -- to show a persistent lack of vision and strategy over your economy, and simply attempting to muddle through is far worse for the business and consumer confidence than having a more painful medicine than necessary, but having some resoluteness in applying it.

See, when you run a current account surplus with another Euro member, you're giving them goods/services and holding onto the money they give you in return. You're not buying goods/services back off them, you're just sitting on their money as savings.

This is good for you - it's more savings! More money you can spend in your economy. More public work projects that can be funded, etc etc.

But it's not good for your trade partner. Whilst they got the goods and services they wanted, the imports, they now have less money with which can be spent domestically.

It's a problem well known from the convertible money era, the Bretton Woods system. There, everyone is urged to ""buy local"", and to minimise imports - out of fear that of your nation losing money. Similarly, exports were encouraged, all with the goal of trying to bring more gold (money) into your country. [Mercantilism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism) it's called - where you endeavour to import as much ""money"" as you can, by supplying as many exports as you can, and buying few imports. It's impossible for this to work for everyone of course, because for every nation that's exporting more than it's importing, there must be another importing more than it's exporting. It fails hard in aggregate.

For the longest time, the focus of addressing this problem has been on the nations running the deficit. OH, well you're not competitive enough! Free up your labour markets! Just be better at exporting, damn you! Etc.

But in reality, it takes two to tango. It's going to be a combination of factors that's leading to Germany's such massive current account surpluses. As an export powerhouse, it's had no problem hoovering up Euros from other members - but this has proved to be a huge problem for the South. And so begrudgingly, Germany had agreed to take steps to reduce the size of its current account surpluses. The limit is in theory 6% (how this number was decided I'm unsure), a limit that has not been [at all adhered to by Germany](http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Articles/Detail/?lng=en&amp;id=173816).

The University ratings as used today are fairly new, it started out with the Shanghai rating to help Chinese students pick a foreign university. But the information used to get those ratings, are questionable to say the least.

For instance, uni's score points for publication output. The more articles posted in a science magazine, the more points you get. But what magazines? What are the quality of the articles? Have they been peer reviewed or not? What happened to peer reviewed articles to have been proven false? The sauciest example is The University of Alexandria, Egypt. It has a very high ranking based on published articles, but the articles (300 or so a year) are written by one engineer and published in a magazine he's editor of.

Other chief indicators are the % of people getting a degree, or the teacher-student ratio, or the amount of post-graduates or simply the amount of money avaliable.

These aren't factor of quality, but factors of quantity.

Einerseits will ich nicht der Aussage Islam != Frieden folgen,  aber andererseits muss ich schon sagen,  dass ich der Meinung bin, dass Asylbewerber christlichen Glaubens es einfacher haben (werden),  sich in unsere Gesellschaft zu integrieren,  da sie durch ihren Glauben ein eher westliches Wertebild haben bzw. in der Regel sicherlich auch dankbarer sind,  da es sich hierbei um Menschen handelt,  die normalerweise nicht nur vor Tod und Krieg (aus dem nahen Osten) fliehen,  sondern auch noch vor einer gewissen Form der Diskriminierung, die sie oft in ihren Heimatländern erfahren haben. 

Eigentlich erkennt man an den Vorfällen wieder,  dass Religion im Kern,  vor allem aus heutiger Sicht,  überflüssig ist. 

Die haben ihn im Prinzip nur zusammengeschlagen,  weil er den falschen imaginären Freund hatte. Er bzw. seine Familie sind ja auf der Feier nur aufgefallen,  weil sein Kind einen eher christlichen Namen hatte. 

Eigentlich sollten die Angreifer dankbar sein,  dass Ihnen Asyl gewährt wurde und nicht derart Zucht veranstalten. 

 Jeder,  der solch ein Problem mit Christen und deren Werten hat,  sollte besser kein Asyl in einem Land,  das christlich geprägt ist, suchen. 

Meine Befürchtung ist,  dass es a)  kaum Folgen für sie haben wird und b)  es bei vielen,  die dauerhaftes Asyl bekommen, zu Problemen kommt,  weil sie sich nur schlecht ""einleben"" können.

Sorry for the news site link, but you can check those numbers easily. Turns out I overstated the whole ""agreed to"" part, because apparently those summit goals are not binding, like pirate rules, and Germany just decided that those goals aren't for us

I'm having a hard time with this.

This always has to do with ideology.

false,[deleted],null,null,"Yes, strange how the West does not really see this, we saw similar problems here: aristocratic lords opressed the serfs but also to some extent cared for them, later on capitalist lords did not feel the same kind of caring for servants and proletarians and without pity threw out the old or sick workers to the streets to starve. While the old aristocratic lords were often more caring, often like, even an old and sick servant who cannot work deserves some food and a place to sleep. So for the old lords servants were more like very very low ranking family members, for the new capitalist lords they were entirely strangers, human machines.

To be fair, British  Tories around the time of the Disrali-Gladstone debate did say the same, that the Gladstonian liberal free market is less caring about the poor than the old, paternalistic aristocratic lords were.

But I think in the West this discussion went entirely forgotten: the Disraeli type Old Right went extinct, Gladstonian free-marketism became the new conservatism, and on the left socialism arose. So it was overshadowed by a new debate. 

I think one lesson to learn that there is a 100-150 difference in history, I am not even sure we here really went fully to a capitalist mindset or we are partially feudal in thinking, I think we are partially feudal, and further east I am mostly certain partial feudalism, it is not yet that kind of Britain in 1850 type of  capitalist thing, I think it is older, so it is rather impossible to expect people to think the same way and have the same values.",0,1412237655,null,0,1412237893,0,cky8vz8,t3_2i0srz,t1_cky8vz8,t1_cky5gxd,null,1426722649,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Dico ingenuo perchè la situazione in cui ci si trova adesso, con bilance commerciali completamente a favore della Germania e la Germania che chiede ""i sacrifici"" è una situazione pianificata a tavolino già prima dell' euro - con l' ECU, e prima dell' ECU c'era lo SME.

L' economia del 2014 è un' economia in cui la domanda, e non l' offerta, è il fattore limitante. La Germania ha ed ha sempre avuto un surplus di offerta. La Germania ha ed ha sempre avuto bisogno di un mercato. L' euro offre alla Germania il mercato di cui ha bisogno senza il rischio di cambio che il mercato comporterebbe se le altre nazioni non avessero adottato ~~il marco~~ l' euro. Il debito risultante dallo sbilanciamento non viene corretto in nessun modo ed è assolutamente normale e prevedibile che si creino situazioni dove il pesce più grosso mangia tutto - visto che i normali e fisiologici fattori correttivi sono stati del tutto eliminati.

La Germania vuole che l' Italia smetta di fare debito? Chiuda le frontiere e metta i dazi. E' semplice e talmente ovvio che ogni volta che sento parlare dei sacrifici dico ""ma questi sono scemi davvero o ci fanno? (spoiler: ci fanno)"". Il debito è la conseguenza del fatto che la domanda interna italiana è stata soddisfatta per anni con l' offerta tedesca, e non italiana. Di conseguenza, l' offerta italiana (le fabbriche) avvizzisce. E' davvero così difficile?

Best place to party: Bairro Alto, Lisbon. Just lots of friendly people drinking 4 euro mojitos in the street, talking to one another. Fun friendly environment. And their clubs play better music than in Madrid (sorry Madrid).

Whenever people (and journalists are people as well in most cases) come close to a power source there will be some form of temptation. I bet there are quite a few scandals uncovered because a journalist might hope for a better relation with the subject or try to gain other advantages... that is not right but just human and happens in every profession (medical, science etc...). A cure for this is a certain mass of independent news layouts, because it doesn't matter how big or small said scandal is - there will always be at least one journalist who want to get the scoop... 
But here lies the real problem: Most mass media is concentrated on a few publishing houses and overworked Online-and Print-Editors often just have the resources to rewrite a press release or a Reuters-News. And the new trend to install ""investigative journalistic departments"" will not stop this. You might get some germany-wide scandals like the ADAC-fraudthing uncovered but who should investigate a construction-scandal in a little town these days? 
Besides most big Newspapers in Germany are openly or not-openly politically biased: The Sueddeutsche is traditionally a little bit left of the center while the Focus is obviously very fond of CDU/CSU. And ARD and ZDF are always controlled in parts by the current government.

So a bias free journalist is just as important for an article as a smart and questioning reader.

""Tra corsie telepass lunghe chilometri e autostrade a quattro corsie, è sempre più frequente vedere veicoli che rimanendo (o spostandosi) sulla corsia di destra superano chi sta alla loro sinistra. Sono manovre lecite?
Partiamo dalla definizione di sorpasso data dal codice della strada, articolo 148: «manovra mediante la quale un veicolo supera un altro veicolo, un animale o un pedone in movimento o fermi sulla corsia o sulla parte della carreggiata destinata normalmente alla circolazione». Nei decenni, dottrina e giurisprudenza hanno chiarito che un sorpasso si ha solo quando chi lo effettua si sposta lateralmente (anche di poco). Tanto che l'articolo 148 (in vigore dal '93), nel descrivere la manovra, dice che prima ci si deve portare a sinistra del sorpassato (che viaggia sulla stessa corsia) e poi si deve rientrare al più presto (salvo che non si debbano superare altri veicoli e/o che non s'intralcino altri mezzi più veloci).
Dunque, in autostrada chi si trova sulla destra e vi resta sfilando davanti a un veicolo più lento sulla sua sinistra effettua solo ciò che in gergo si chiama superamento e non infrange l'articolo 148. Si potrebbe ritenere che, quando non c'è traffico tale da far rallentare qualsiasi veicolo si trovi in strada, venga però violato l'articolo 144, per il fatto di circolare per file parallele senza che ce ne siano le condizioni. La Cassazione ha però stabilito che non si è sanzionabili, a patto di accertarsi che chi sta davanti non abbia alcuna intenzione di rientrare a destra e di cautelarsi contro un suo eventuale rientro improvviso. In sostanza, gli si deve lampeggiare e/o suonare, sia per accertarsi delle sue intenzioni sia per avvertirlo del superamento in corso, che va fatto lasciandosi un margine per evitare la collisione (va considerato che non di rado chi non tiene la destra sta guidando distrattamente, soprattutto ora che impazzano telefonini, navigatori e tablet). Viceversa, in questo caso, colui che viene superato viola l'articolo 143, che al comma 5 stabilisce ch quando la carreggiata è a più corsie si deve percorrere la corsia libera più a destra, essendo le altre normalmente riservate al sorpasso (tranne quando è ammesso circolare per file parallele).""",0,1412240436,null,0,false,0,cky9crd,t3_2i23br,t1_cky9crd,t1_cky9888,null,1426722370,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

There is still a question mark over whether this process will succeed and even if it does succeed, how long it will take and at what cost. Will Eurozonians really want this? Will the richer Eurozone states consent to vast and permanent transfers of wealth to the periphery? Will strong federal institutions be created? The last five years of crisis have not answered these questions. This makes me think that there will be years and years of crisis to follow in the eurozone, with continued low growth and high unemployment and continued trends of people voting for extreme political parties. All this makes the eurozone system fundamentally unstable. How many more years of crisis are you prepared to accept?

The point I am making is that just because a single currency works in the US, this does not mean it will easily work in the eurozone. My point is not that the US is homogenous, it clearly isn't. My point is that it has other systems to deal with the fact of a single currency over a non-homogenous economic area. The eurozone does not have these systems.

false,-to-,FRAN,France,"The euro crisis is not so much about government debt, as some would make you believe, but about trade imbalances within the eurozone. A trade deficit increases the total (govt. + private) external debt, while a trade surplus yields net foreign financial assets. External debt tends to be a problem when the creditors say ""enough"" (see Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy). A surplus is not much of a problem (except when the countries you lent to cannot repay) but the point is that worldwide, all countries' trade balances sum to zero (unless we trade with Mars or something). A currency union such as the EZ, or any country with free capital flows and a floating currency, tends to have a small net trade balance due to currency fluctuations ""damping"" trade flows. Within a currency union (or with pegged currencies) such imbalances can develop quickly.

The eurozone member states' trade balances sum to the total EZ trade balance with the rest of the world (positive 1~2% of GDP IIRC). Exporting countries are thus as much responsible for the imbalances within the union than deficit countries. EZ rules agreed on a few years ago put limits at -3%/+6% of GDP.

That doesn't mean the project failed, or it can never work.

&gt;  This makes me think that there will be years and years of crisis to follow in the eurozone, with continued low growth and high unemployment and continued trends of people voting for extreme political parties.

With the recent economic crisis, we were bound to have, on average, low growth (even recessions) and high unemployment rate.

Regarding extreme political parties, that's something that would've happened anyhow.  In fact, the EU is an effective way to dissuade people to vote for radical extremists, because they tend to be against something which tends to be supportedy by the average joe.

Breaking up the Euro would make the new Dmark explode in value, and they would pay by unemployment. They will do what is necessary to keep the euro afloat, even if they grumble along the way.

&gt;Do you have any proof that the euro has brought any growth

Any proof that it didn't? It's mostly speculation. What can be proven is that it caused prices to converge, proving that different currencies make price comparisons difficult and hinder efficient markets.

&gt;or that the EU has brought any peace?

The EU is the big post-war project of pacifist Europe and the foremost tool of achieving goals through peaceful means in the whole of Europe.

&gt;There is no right and wrong, economics is not a moral science.

Adam Smith disagrees.

&gt;So please tell me how do you make Germans and Germany accept to pay each year an equivalent of 2% of their GDP (net transfers between states in the US) to ensure economic integration of Greece, Spain, or Portugal?

The ECB brings money into circulation corresponding to last year's inflation (the inflation target is 2%) by dividing it evenly across all citizens in the eurozone. This will help the poorest citizens the most while not having a very inflationary impact in the richer countries.

Russia is fighting a slowly losing battle and Kremlin does have a wonderful ability to make their neighbors hate them.

I would add that besides a military threat what Russia is afraid of is a domino effect of some scale. If they lose their trading partners and allies they would start losing pieces of the puzzle and Russia would become weaker. Possibly showing other regions that Russian Federation is weaker, might try to be more independent.

Russia is a huge land mass, they need that extra resource flow to even transport and manage their own country.

Another irony I find in Russia as a state is that they always looked to Europe with admiration. Was it Catherine that reformed Russian upper classes to mimic European style? Also how they built St.Petersburg on the Baltic sea coast as a new capital of Russia to be more into the region.

Not until the people all over Europe moved from being serfs of the land into a more citizen of a nation type deal, has Russia started searching for a self image along with other countries, keyword being here the scary ""nationalism"".

false,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; That doesn't mean the project failed...

It kind of depends what metrics you use to test success. [If you look at the EC's website](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/why/index_en.htm), it seems that they thought that the euro would bring things like ""*and for the whole European economy to perform better, bringing more jobs and greater prosperity for Europeans*. Where is this ""*more employment and better quality jobs*""?  By its own metrics, it does seem like the euro project is currently failing.

&gt; or it can never work

Of course, perhaps it can. My point is that for it to succeed, massive changes are needed and currently we are moving painfully slowly in the direction of change towards them. The question of whether rich eurozone will accept massive fiscal transfers is no closer to being answered.

&gt; With the recent economic crisis, we were bound to have, on average, low growth (even recessions) and high unemployment rate.

The difficulty here is that there was a global economic crisis, but now everywhere in the globe has returned to strong economic growth apart from the eurozone. The UK also had a recession and high unempoyment, but in the last couple of years the UK has created more jobs than the rest of the EU put together. 

&gt; In fact, the EU is an effective way to dissuade people to vote for radical extremists, because they tend to be against something which tends to be supportedy by the average joe. 

This is going to be an incredibly interesting thing to watch and I am not so sure I agree with you. The longer the crisis continues (and it does appear to be continuing) the better that ""unorthodox"" political parties seem to be doing all over the EU: AfD in Germany, FN in France, M5S in Italy, Podemos in Spain, Golden Dawn and Syriza in Greece, FPO in Austria etc. It is hard to predict how these unorthodox political parties will develop going forwards. Currently it does not seem that the EU has succeeded in dissuading people from voting for them.

&gt; I agree, but it also doesn't automatically mean it won't work, and everything should be scrapped.

My argument isn't that it should be scrapped. It is that it should be done properly or not at all. This via media is what is not ideal.

&gt; The EU institution is already a wonder all by itself. The euro, in comparison, is a minor issue.

Personally I think that the euro is a somewhat major issue as it it intimately connected with the entire project of European integration. While other bits of the European project have been successful, I agree, the single currency (and its success or failure) has become fundamental to the project.

Vielmehr waren die Leute völlig überlastet und mit den Arbeitsbedingungen an sich unzufrieden und die meisten, mit denen ich gesprochen habe zumindest, würden auf höhere Gehälter verzichten wenn die Bedingungen einfach besser wären. 

Für Ärzte mit Niederlassung ist es z.B. wohl jedes Quartal ein Krampf, auch wirklich für alle durchgeführten Behandlungen Geld zu bekommen. Einem Bekannter (FA für Allgemeinmedizin) schuldet die AOK nach seiner Aussage regelmäßig 5-stellige Beträge, die sie nur mit viel adminstrativem Aufwand und Durchhaltevermögen rausrückt.  Das ist wohl ein strukturelles Problem des Gesundheitswesens - die Bezahlung richtet sich irgendwie nach prognostizierten Pauschalbeträgen die in der Regel viel zu niedrig sind, und für alles was darüber hinaus geht muss der Arzt mit der Kasse kämpfen, auch wenn es ihm eigentlich zusteht. Hab mir sagen lassen, dass das der Grund ist, warum viele Fachärzte dazu neigen gegen Ende des Quartals (wenn die Pauschalbeträge überschritten sind) keine neuen Patienten mehr anzunehmen bzw. nur noch Privatpatienten reinzulassen. Bei den Ärzten in den Kliniken sind es die unmenschlichen Schichten die erwartet werden und sich nur bedingt in der Bezahlung widerspiegeln.

Was ich außerdem von vielen Ärzten, ob niedergelassen oder in der Klinik, gehört habe ist eine ziemlich tiefe Unzufriedenheit damit, dass der Beruf immer administrativer (und im Falle der Niedergelassenen: unternehmerischer) wird und unter dem ganzen Verwaltungsakt die Zeit mit dem Patienten leidet.

false,Krawall2,null,null,"Kann man nicht. Zeigt die Geschichte. Verloren wurden Kriege nur, wenn die Armee den Großteil der Bewaffnung gestellt und das Volk fast unbewaffnet war. Sieh mal nach Afghanistan, wo das Volk erst die Briten, dann die Sowjets und dann die Nato nach Hause schickte. Trotz erdrückender Luftüberlegenheit. 

Oder der Irak, in welchem die Amerikaner die Armee innerhalb von 4 Wochen schlugen und dann erstmal 7 Jahre lang vom Volk bekämpft und schlussendlich zum Abzug gezwungen wurden.

Ich red hier auch nicht davon einen Gegner militärisch zu schlagen, sondern eine Besatzung schlicht zu kostspielig zu machen. Wenn hier 80 Millionen Bewaffnete leben würden und den Besatzern wie den Amerikanern ständig tausende Soldaten über die Klinge springen, würde das auf Dauer zu teuer werden und man könnte den ständigen Abfluss an Material und Leben vor der eigenen Bevölkerung nicht mehr rechtfertigen. Ergo Abzug der Besatzer.

Diese verquere Logik von starker Armee ist ja sowieso nur übernommen aus den Broschüren der Rüstungsindustrie. Armeen kommen nie mit Partisanen oder Widerstandskämpfern klar. Die reiben sich langsam aber sicher auf.

Was auch oft nicht begriffen wird, dies liegt hauptsächlich darin begründet, dass die Amerikaner ihr Waffengesetz so weit beschnitten haben, ist das der 2te Verfassungszusatz dort eigentlich keine Einschränkungen bezüglich der Waffen kennt, ist das die dort eigentlich in der Lage sein sollten sich auch privat Flugabwehrrakten oder ähnliches zu besorgen, dank der Verfassungsfeinde im Präsidentenamt ist dies aber mittlerweile nicht mehr möglich. Das Recht auf Waffenbesitz kennt nämlich keine Einschränkung, schließt im Prinzip sogar Kernwaffen ein.

Auch hier in Deutschland ist dies eigentlich so aus der Verfassung herzuleiten. 

Der Artikel 20(4) räumt den Deutschen ein Widerstandsrecht ein, welches keine rechtliche Begrenzung kennt. Wie soll ein Volk ohne Waffen aber Widerstand leisten? Allein die Logik des 20(4) gebietet es in Deutschland ein extrem liberales Waffenrecht zu haben, schließlich muss sich das Volk gegen jeden, also auch Militär, verteidigen können, der es unternimmt die FDGO abzuschaffen.

Mindestens aber müssten die Waffengesetze auf dem Stand von 49 eingefroren sein, als das GG geschrieben wurde. Denn mit diesem im Hinterkopf wurde dies verabschiedet.

Aber mach das mal den Verfassungsfeinden im Parlament klar, die sich nach jedem Amoklauf in Aktionismus überbieten und die dümmsten Verbote aussprechen oder so wie du den Lügen der Rüstungslobby folgen und selbst nach dem xten fehlgeschlagenen Invasionskrieg wieder was von starker Armee erzählen.

&gt;Man scheint ja ziemlich genau zu wissen wer Terrorist ist, also wieso wird da nichts unternommen? Ich spreche hier auch nicht von präventiver Tötung, sondern u. U. sowas schrecklichem wie ein Ausreiseverbot? Information der türkischen Behörden, so dass die den wieder zurückschicken wenn der dort aus dem Flugzeug steigt? Irgendwas? Nein?
**Ach ja, da war ja was. Es gab ja die Stallorder den Terroristennachschub nicht zu behindern**

Daraufhin antwortete mir ein Verschwörungstheoretiker:

&gt;**Alleine die Prämisse zu deiner Verknüpfung -die Existenz eines Motivs der BRD zur Unterstützung der radikal-islamistischen Terroristen- nach dem eigenen Prinzip ""Cui Bono"" betrachtet, kann verworfen werden.** Denn schließlich hilft der sicherheitpolitisch nahezu hysterischen BRD importierter Terror weniger, als ein paar Dutzend deutsche Kämpfer in Syrien/Irak mehr. Interesse kann also gar keins da sein. Und dass die Bundesregierung so eindimensional und plump überlegt wie ein Forentroll und deshalb denkt, Terrortourismus und dessen Re-Import wäre in ihrem Interesse, das glaube ich dann eher nicht.

Dazu noch ein paar Beleidigungen in meine Richtung.

Und nun erneut, der Berg kommt zum Propheten. Falls sich jemand fragt warum ich in solchen Sachen eigentlich immer Recht behalte, ich berate Firmen gerade in Angelegenheiten der Sicherheit.

While google does provide some traffic to web sites they would all have more if google did not exist. I don't think you understand and I don't know how to explain it to you simply. 

We've gone a little too far to fix that issue now and the new stance seems to be to limit the amount of content google is stealing. 

Maybe. Google steals all apple / samsung /nokia phones then gives bits of them away for free and people go to google instead of them. (This is probably not the best analogy) If google had not stolen all the phones it would not be as big as it is. But now it is that big and you are speaking from that perspective which should never have happened in the first place. But like I said too late to fix that but it can and should be reduced.

99% of reddit is stolen content and some people do go to reddit instead of site A, B or C which has lost the traffic to reddit which is nothing but other peoples content but you think reddit is helping them it is not. Then Buzz feed and others steal that shit they found on reddit and make more money off it then the original source and reddit. Eventually the government will make a law.

Of course you can't. But I can explain it to you: people wouldn't bother taking photos of URLs or QR codes on their magazines, and the traffic of those publishers would plummet because the internet would be as useful as TV without a good tool like a search engine.

What? Users always click on Google's links to get the full story. Headlines and one or two sentences are only here to skim what's available. Again Google is providing this service to both the users and publishers for free.

I'm not concerned about URLs. No the traffic will go up. TV and papers are better then the net for good content. The net is going to only get worse as sites will all start charging (pay wall) eventually they can't give away news for free and stay in business. The web is still very far behind in readership and viewership but that will happen. Then the free internet will be all shit like a bad radio station or TV channel no one watches. 

No they don't. But that is only part of the issue. The issue it that they start at google instead of the NYT.

No google is stealing stuff and giving it away for free. That's only good for google.

Why do you think there needs to be a search engine? 

You can't seem to get past the fact the entire design structure of the internet is fucked. You are also not thinking outside that stupid structure.

Russia has tried to manipulate Ukraine through energy politics, displays of force and outright purchase of Ukranian polticians since the failure of the USSR. That is literally it. You are making poor excuses for a needless invasion of your neighbour, and those excuses still don't in anyway make sense in reality.

Giving cheaper prices and lobbying are not economic coercion, while threating economic sanctions to influence internal politics is.

&gt;It didn't.

Read the entire Spiegel article again. There were no legally binding agreements, but assurances were given.

&gt;If you, defending the invasion, have to say this, what does that say about the referendum? If the Ukranian people really wanted to join Russia, why couldn't the referendum wait? Why didn't the referendum offer an option to maintain the status quo?

Not Ukrainian people, Russian people in Ukraine, who in Crimea are a majority. Why wait? Wait for Kiev to take Crimean autonomy completely, to send its troops to prevent Crimea from ever separating etc.

&gt;They were literally shooting at impartial observers. That's like a big red sign saying ""We're probably the bad guys, here.""

God damn it man. They were shooting at *uninvited* **_military_** *observers*, not at _invited_ **_referendum_** *observers*, which refused to show up. Big, big difference there.

&gt;They're impartial observers. Who would they be gathering it for??

Impartial observers who operate from the West.

&gt;Okay, if you are really admitting you lack the brainpower to work this one out, I'll explain it like I would to a highschool politics student. You are offering them discounts to keep ensure they do as you wish. When they pass pro-EU legislation, or make policy movements that you don't agree with, you threaten to increase the price, which you know they can't afford, threaten to shut it off, resulting in death, or actually shut it off, resulting in death.

Ukraine gets cheaper prices for siding with Russia. Both sides benefit. Why should Russia keep giving cheaper prices to Ukraine if they turn their back to them? EU and Ukraine can benefit, while Russia has no benefit and is even at a loss for providing cheaper prices than profitable?

That's in no way economic coercion. That's called a mutually beneficial deal.

&gt;Okay so I'm Irish and we haven't bought any presidents off like complete fucking scumbags. Now defend buying off another president to pass legislation against his people's wishes without mentioning the fucking US. I don't give a single shit about the US. Defend your point or concede you can't.

http://smargiassi.blogautore.repubblica.it/2011/09/20/sorpassare-o-superare/comment-page-1/

""Ma volendo essere diligente ed essendo professionalmente curioso, ho rivolto tempo fa la domanda all’Ufficio relazioni col pubblico della Polizia di Stato, che mi ha fornito cortesemente una risposta competente e, volevo sperarlo, autorevolissima. Ve la riporto:

“La manovra di colui che circolando sulla corsia centrale trova l’ostacolo di un veicolo ed effettua il sorpasso a destra è sanzionato dall’art. 148, comma 15 Cds, con al somma di € 68 e la decurtazione di 5 punti patente. La manovra di colui che prosegue la marcia sulla corsia di destra, nonostante la rpesenza di veicoli sulla corsia o sulle corsie di sinistra, non integra la manovra di sorprasso a destra, ma solo quella di superamento da destra che non è sanzionata”.""  

poi   


""Nei tratti autostradali a 3 corsie sono spesso occupate la corsia centrale e quella di sinistra dal traffico veicolare, mentre risulta più libera quella di destra. 
Chi si trova a percorrere quest'ultima e ""supera"" a destra i veicoli procedendo nella propria corsia commette un'infrazione (sorpasso a destra)? 
Preciso che non vi è cambiamento di corsia e non vi è marcia a file parallele. 

Sulla questione ho trovato due sentenze della Cassazione che portano a risposta diverse: 

ECCO UN ESTRATTO DELLA PRIMA: 

""Per sorpasso di veicolo deve intendersi il superamento di altro veicolo che precede, comunque eseguito e non già solo quello che si svolga mediante spostamento del mezzo verso la sinistra della linea di iniziale scorrimento. Deve, pertanto, ritenersi sorpasso il superamento di altro veicolo che precede e che circoli nella stessa corsia, ancorchè ideale, senza che sia necessario lo spostamento della linea direttrice di marcia su altra corsia"". 

Cass. pen., sez. IV, 22 marzo 1991, n. 3189 

ECCO UN ESTRATTO DELLA SECONDA: 

""Nel caso di carreggiata divisa in più corsie per ogni senso di marcia, non sussiste sorpasso in senso tecnico-giuridico, ai sensi dell'art. 106 c.s., quando due veicoli marcianti in corsie parallele si sopravanzino l'un l'altro restando ciascuno nella propria corsia. In questa ipotesi mancano, infatti, gli elementi costitutivi della manovra di sorpasso, la quale consta di due spostamenti dei veicoli dalla direttiva di marcia, di cui uno, temporaneo, verso sinistra per superare il veicolo che precede e l'altro, conclusivo, verso destra, per effettuare il rientro nella propria mano"". 

Cass. civ., sez. III, 19 settembre 1979, n. 4820 ""

La fattispecie si verifica per mancato rispetto delle disposizioni. Su autostrada a tre corsie i conducenti debbono percorrere la corsia più libera a destra. Il rispetto di questa norma da sola basta ad evitare quanto evidenziato nel quesito. In caso di traffico intenso e le corsie sono occupate capita sovente che la corsia sull'estrema destra sia più veloce di quelle poste alla sua sinistra ed in questo caso vi è uno scorrimento su file parallele e quindi non esiste sorpasso a destra. Vi sono poi autostrade che vietano il sorpasso ai veicoli pesanti che debbono per forza occupare la corsia di destra. In caso di veicoli che procedono lentamente sulle altre corsie, è corretto che procedano tranquillamente sulla loro corsia scorrendo alla destra dei veicoli posti alla loro sinistra. Vi sono poi automobilisti che si piazzano sulla terza corsia circolando a velocità ridotta e non si spostano per alcun motivo. I veicoli che seguono non saranno costretti tutti a mettersi in fila dietro questi. Sarà più opportuno scansarli sulla destra e procedere. Non riscontro in tale manovre sorpasso a destra. Nel sorpasso a destra inoltre la causa principale è del conducente del veicolo che anzichè occupare la corsia più libera a destra circola sulle corsie di sinistra riservate ai veicoli più veloci. ""

Polizia Locale:
""La risposta del lettore è corretta. In effetti è VIETATO il sorpasso a destra, anche se chi occupa la corsia viaggia a velocità inferiore a quella suggerita dalla Concessionaria del tratto Autostradale. A parte l'obbligo per gli autocarri di viaggiare sulla corsia a destra e di occupare la seconda solo per il sorpasso (o le prime due a destra nei tratti a quattro corsie). 
Lo zigzagare tra le corsie è sicuramente vietato e fonte di pericolo per la sicurezza della circolazione. In effetti occorre verificare l'art. 143 del Codice, anche se la Polizia di Stato, in una intervista recente aveva affermato che proseguire sulla corsia occupata superando un veicolo che procede su di una corsia a sinistra non integra la condizione di ""sorpasso"" e quindi non è veitato. (dott.ssa Rosanna Ferranti, vice questore aggiunto della PS).""

false,Sc3p,null,null,"Hast du schonmal daran gedacht, dass eventuellen Angreifern das Leben der Zivilisten vollkommen egal sein könnte? Auch wenn in den Kriegen im Nahen Osten viele Zivilisten umkamen, so wären noch deutlich mehr gestorben hätte man nicht auf sie geachtet und ungeachtet der eigenen Verluste jeden mit Verdacht auf Waffen erschossen.       

Das war im 2. Weltkrieg ähnlich, in der Gegend wo ich aufgewachsen bin hatte eigentlich jeder Haushalt nen paar Waffen im Keller nur für den Fall der Fälle. Die wurden bevor die Amis kamen auch allesamt zusammen mit anderem ""unerwünschtem Zeugs"" in Güllegruben oder im Wald versenkt. Warum? Weil ne Knarre im Haus ne Erschießung auf der Stelle oder jahrelange Internerierung mit sich gezogen hätte.         

Du solltest nicht von den mehr oder weniger humanen Kriegen im nahen Osten ausgehen, sondern von Kriegen wo der Besatzer auch längerfristig bleiben will. In Frankreich wurden damals ganze Dörfer exekutiert, wenn in der Nähe ein Sabotageakt stattfand. Nicht ausgebildtete Zivilisten werden keine Chance gegen eine professionelle Armee haben. Der Grund warum die Amis da unten gescheitert sind, sind zum einen die Angst vor eigenenen Verlusten, weil der Krieg da eh schon unpopulär war und zum anderem die riesigen unbewohnten Flächen und Höhlen wo sich Widerstandskämpfer verstecken konnten. Wäre auf jeden Angriff auf einen US-Konvoi ein Vergeltungsschlag gegen Zivilisten gefolgt wären da ziemlich schnell ein paar Hinweise auf den Verbleib gewisser Leute gefallen.         

Du vergleichst hier Äpfel und Birnen: Würde irgendeine fremde Macht es wagen die Nato anzugreifen, so kann man sich sicher sein dass da keine Rücksicht auf Verluste genommen würde und von beiden Seiten extreme Kriegsverbrechen begangen würden. Du sprichst hier schließlich nicht von einem ""kleinem"" Krieg irgendwo in der Pampa, sondern von einem Weltkrieg. Und die laufen bekannterweise ein bisschen anders ab als andere Kriege, wo man in der Regel nur einen Teil der Bevölkerung hinter sich hat und der Rest keinen Sinn in einem Konflikt sieht.       


Btw: Das Projekt Gladio hatte einen ähnlichen Gedanken, nämlich einige bewaffnete Gruppierungen zurücklassen und die dann Sabotageakte begehen lassen (War natürlich voll mit Rechtsextremen weil der Kommunismus ja der Feind war und keine gute Idee).
Aber eine Armee absichtlich schwächen und dafür das Volk bewaffnen ist einfach nur dumm. Abgesehen davon, dass Zivilisten keine Chance haben würde es in Friedenszeiten uns in Verhältnisse wie in den USA versetzen. Jeder Polizist muss damit rechnen, dass jemand eine Waffe dabei hat, eventueller Anstieg der Mordrate (mit Pistolen tötet es sich einfach leichter und schneller) und nen Haufen Idioten die jetzt ganz leicht an Waffen rankommen und damit scheiße bauen.

Ukraine isn't in NATO or the EU, which is where our formal ""collective deterrence"" resides. So did we let a foreign country (Russia) invade and annexe a foreign country (Ukraine), yes absolutely. Did we let Russia invade and annexe a ""European"" country (in a political or legal sense), no we did not.

Its also interesting that you consider Ukraine European, but mention Russia only as ""foreign"" or ""neighbours"". It would be very difficult to draw such a division between the people of Kiev and the people of Moscow in my opinion.

McCain is not some fringe politician. He's an elected official, and a prominent member of U.S. congress.

&gt;So is the Crimean referendum, the Russian annexation and the presence of foreign troops in East Ukraine then, so I don't see where you are going with this line of thought.

All of which came after the EU actions.

&gt;And without exception those are a response to a government suppressing its own citizens. There wasn't any agreement signed yet.

Budapest memo, which you so oft cite, prevents influencing internal politics through economic coercion.

&gt;And Turkey is the legal successor to the Ottoman Empire, but they don't get to claim their territory back either.

No they don't, because there were no deals made that influenced dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, that were made void by Western actions. It is a completely different situation.

&gt;Now that's just silly. They collapsed on their own without any help.

In order for Moscow to allow German reunification, it was given assurances that NATO would not expand an inch eastward. The Russian belief that this was a genuine promise contributed greatly to USSR dissolving peacefully, without a struggle.

It is obvious that promise was a blatant lie.

&gt;At that point in time Eastern Europe was part of the Warsaw Pact. Nato expansion at that point meant poaching countries away from the Warsaw Pact, and we never did that. We just picked up the pieces when it fell apart on its own. We never intervened when eg. Belarus wanted to associate itself with Russia. We even kept well out of the questionable events in the Kaukasus.

No, the agreement was that if German unification was allowed, NATO would not move an inch eastward, full stop, no other conditions. As you can see from Spiegel article, Moscow was led to believe that NATO would not expand eastward whatsoever.",0,1412247259,null,0,false,0,ckyaifc,t3_2hsn32,t1_ckyaifc,t1_cky8kpj,null,1426721829,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I don't buy it. Dividing Germany and developing nuclear weapons and new war tactics is what makes a war impossible in Europe. You can't invade a hostile country anymore.

Perche' sul mercato italiano i prodotti tedeschi dovrebbero essere vantaggiosi rispetto a quelli italiani ?

L'azienda italiana e' sul territorio, conosce tutti i canali, ha agganci politici, ha costi di trasporto minori. Ha a disposizione una intera generazione di manodopera a basso costo, schiavi sottopagati senza neanche i diritti base tipo ferie o malattia e senza rappresentanza sindacale.

Tutto fa pensare che un prodotto italiano debba costare meno ed essere distribuito piu' facilmente, in minor tempo e ad un prezzo piu' basso. In queste condizioni, perche' i prodotti tedeschi dovrebbero essere avvantaggiati ?

Letztendlich läuft die ganze Diskussion auf eine grundsätzliche ethische Frage hinaus: Kann ich akzeptieren und verantworten, dass für meinen persönlichen Genuss Tiere getötet werden? Die weiterführende Frage wäre dann ""Sehe ich Tiere als weniger schützenswert an als Menschen"". Ich persönlich beantworte beide Fragen mit ""ja"". Es geht nicht um ""richtig"" und ""falsch"", es gibt in der Ethik selten Dinge, die inhärent richtig oder falsch sind. Deswegen muss der Typ auch gar nicht mit ""FAKTEN!!einself"" um die Ecke kommen. 

Die Zustände in der Massentierhaltung muss man meiner Meinung nach davon losgelöst betrachten, denn hier kann der Gesetzgeber ansetzen. Allerdings muss man natürlich auch Geld für entsprechende Kontrollen in die Hand nehmen und die Eier haben, auch einen großen Betrieb mal zu sanktionieren. Was da an Lobbyarbeit passiert, ist glaube ich in der Tat nicht zu unterschätzen.

Was mir, abgesehen von dem generellen ""holier-than-thou""-Vibe, tierisch (heh) auf die Eier geht, ist diese bekackte romantische Vorstellung von Natur und ""kleinbäuerlicher Landwirtschaft"", die oft in solchen Posts mitschwingt. Klassisches Beispiel ist die Freilandhaltung von Hühnern. Die ganzen Hippies denken, das muss ja total spitze sein, so mit Natur und freiem Himmel und so, weil sie ihre eigenen Vorstellungen auf die Tiere projizieren. Dass Hühner Fluchttiere sind und freier Himmel sie oft in Panik versetzt, interessiert da keinen. Oder wenn die Grünen mal wieder die Rückkehr zu kleinen Betrieben fordern.

But ignoring the conventional option restricts you to the nuclear option. You would end up skipping over any chance of keeping a conflict conventional &amp; limited to the Baltics to one that's global &amp; ends in wide-ranging nuclear holocaust. 

I've never understood the prominent sentiment in this subreddit that it would be a good idea to just scrap your conventional military and merely rely on a nuclear deterrent. It's never good to back yourself in a corner, especially when nuclear warfare is on the table. ICBMs should be a last-resort, not your only resort.

Although I agree Russia would more than likely hit us with tactical nukes if we invaded Russia proper *(or even East Ukraine)*. And that would probably easily escalate into ICBMs &amp; strategic nukes in general. 

But I highly doubt that's the case with the Baltics. Any war there would probably, in my opinion, be short, limited &amp; conventional, hence the importance of power projection and being able to respond quickly to situations with your military.

RE: Step 2: I am on the admissions committee for my department at the university where I work at.  We mostly just check to see if we think that international students can hack it.  We've never turned down admission to someone we thought could hack it in the program.  There aren't that many international undergrads anyway.  I think that at present, we have three undergrads from the UK (I know at least two were au pairs in the area and loved it and decided to stay), plus we have two people from South America (another au pair and someone who went to a German school while growing up).  In these cases, we knew that the people were able to live and function on their own and generally had their own independent social groups for support - they weren't going to show up, come to classes for two weeks, and then disappear.

RE: Step 6: A visa and a residence permit are not the same thing.  A visa is what allows you to enter a country.  This can either be a document that you apply for in advance of your travels, or can even just be the stamp in your passport that you get when you go through customs.  This all depends on what agreements exist with the country that issued your passport and the country that you are going to.  A residence permit is what lets you stay in a country for a longer period of time.  They are completely separate things, generally issued by completely different offices.

- Sur le site on est en train de tester pas mal de choses en A/B testing, la moitié des gens voient une version différente, et on change régulièrement les tests menés. Mode ""lean"".

- Par rapport à l'existant on veut vraiment être mobile et social. Mobile car c'est l'avenir et permet pas mal de choses en plus (géoloc, immédiat, etc) et social pour pouvoir mettre en avant les relations entre les utilisateurs et ainsi avoir un climat de confiance.

But The tactic to destroy a civilization isn't working in your neighborhood and the point here is, the coup d'etat started in the very moment, when Ukraine had the choice between offers from EU and Russia and Yanukovych didn't signed the agreement with the EU. I guess the EU was bad prepared and helped to start this thingie Maidan without reassuring that the new regime is a well known replacement.  To me it's looking like the failure of the Americans when they made a catholic puppet to South Vietnam's president and everyone knew Catholicism was identified with oppression. In this case everyone knew the country is split into to large groups but the EU vowed support to  one part only. My guess is, the EU believed the military power of Kiev is sufficient. 

In fact the Ukraine becomes quite expensive and not even Putin seems to be very interested to take over Donetz. The EU is already paying for sanctions to peasants and the Ukraine has no industry adapted to the standards of the EU. This reminds me on Eastern Germany and the hundreds of billions to upgrade the region to the standards of Western Germany. As far as I know the EU this will not happen. The EU itself is fucked because of the Mediterranean countries with a weak economy and because of Spain which is a potential country for civil war because of Catalonia and a ridiculous stupid administration in Madrid . Cameron was in the case of Scotland much smarter. The German government wants just better export opportunities or cheap labor.

&gt;All of which came after the EU actions.

Those were directly in response and tied to the violence against the citizens and could be lifted by simply stopping that violence. But you're not kidding me: the Russian actions came after their straw man antagonized the Ukrainian citizens so much he was chased out of his palace.

In addition, annexations and sending troops is a severe escalation and increase the violence and deaths. Why not just stop the violence rather than escalating it?

&gt;Budapest memo, which you so oft cite, prevents influencing internal politics through economic coercion.

The sanctions were aimed at specific persons and were directly tied to their personal violent actions against the Ukrainian citizens. The Ukrainian economy wasn't sanctioned, those were personal sanctions. Russia, on the other hand, had been playing hot and cold with Ukraine's energy security for years before.

About the memorandum: Russia violated points 1, 2 and 3 directly and repeatedly. The West imposed sanctions at some persons who were massacring Ukrainian citizens. It should come as no surprise that Ukraine preferred to deal with the West. (I cited it once if at all, by the way. Get some sleep.)

&gt;No they don't, because there were no deals made that influenced dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, that were made void by Western actions. It is a completely different situation.

Well, Ukraine is a completely different situation too then. Jeeze.

&gt;In order for Moscow to allow German reunification, it was given assurances that NATO would not expand an inch eastward. The Russian belief that this was a genuine promise contributed greatly to USSR dissolving peacefully, without a struggle. It is obvious that promise was a blatant lie.

So otherwise they would have started a war? I completely support that lie then.

&gt;No, the agreement was that if German unification was allowed, NATO would not move an inch eastward, full stop, no other conditions. As you can see from Spiegel article, Moscow was led to believe that NATO would not expand eastward whatsoever.

And with good reason. NATO would not and should not accept nations that are currently at war. The scenario would be very simple:

1: Ukraine joins NATO.

2: Ukraine invokes Article V as it is being attacked.

Der Code sieht nach C# aus, hier muss entweder die Version selber zusammengebaut werden (aus Major- und Minor Version Number), was bei einem Update eine entsprechende Anpassung erfordern würde, oder es wird direkt eine ToString() Methode aufgerufen. Da der zurückgegebene String hierbei so aussieht wie Microsoft es sich vorstellt, könnte man da etwas zur Kollisionsvermeidung nutzen.

Ersteres würde das angebliche Problem nicht auslösen, letzteres wäre mit einem Update der .NET Runtime gelöst und es wäre keine Anpassung seitens der Entwickler erforderlich, um alte Software funktionsfähig zu halten.

Aber der Code ist leicht verständlich, also muss es natürlich stimmen und es bringt Leser. Haben große Zeitungen niemanden, der mehr als nur ein Hello World programmieren kann? :(

The waste problem still isn't solved. Where to put the radioactive waste? Just unload it onto the coming 1000 generations?Bury it somewhere? Send it to eastern europe or africa?

Make no mistake. German engineers may be able to build safe nuclear power plants, but huge energy companies only want cheap power plants (= old, already written off ones). Also there is no 100% safety (you could argue that the japanese should also be able to run a power plant properly, couldn't you?). If you have a hazard in a nuclear power plant, whole regions can turn to a nuclear wasteland for hundreds, maybe even thousands of years. And for what? To make the big power companies even richer than they are today? Because again, make no mistake - the allegedly low costs won't be passed to the customers, that's as safe as the bank of England.

Of course Russia neighbors still feel unsafe, that I understand. It's always easier to bully the smaller guys.

That didn't concern Ukraine because the sad fact is that Ukraine does not matter in geopolitical terms for western europe nor the US and there was no reason for our government to do anything about it other than words (you were in russia's playground a decade ago, you're still there now, nothing has changed and we haven't lost anything).

It's their country. It's why NATO doesn't invade Russia even though it's stripping away the rights of it's citizens in the name of nationalist protection policies.

For goodness sake the findings of the OSCE are literally open to everyone everywhere. It was *created* as a forum for international impartiality and communication during the cold war. Russia has availed of the services several times. But now you are discrediting a renowned, impartial organization because it suits your political aims.

&gt; Ukraine gets cheaper prices for siding with Russia. Both sides benefit. Why should Russia keep giving cheaper prices to Ukraine if they turn their back to them? EU and Ukraine can benefit, while Russia has no benefit and is even at a loss for providing cheaper prices than profitable?

That's in no way economic coercion. That's called a mutually beneficial deal.

It is. It's incredibly, absurdly, *offensively* disengenuous to believe otherwise and I won't entertain your nonsensical idea that it isn't anymore. It's beyond stupid. It's done.

The burden of proof is on you if you insist, since you claimed first that it did. But I prefer to ignore it because ""what would have happened if..."" is purely speculative and just ends up projecting our preconception on our speculations.

&gt;Price have diverged.

The first three graphs in your link are just two countries, so that doesn't say a lot. The last graph shows that all values are to be found in a 5 percent range in 2007, while they are found in a 6 percent range in 2010. Truly, a gigantic divergence.

Goods prices did converge, anyway:[""We find that prices from the exact same store for the exact same product differ significantly across countries outside the Eurozone, but are often identical within the Eurozone.""](http://bpp.mit.edu/the-euro-and-price-convergence/)

&gt;Define morale then.

Consult a dictionary.

&gt;Smith rejected the idea that Man was capable of forming moral judgements beyond a limited sphere of activity, again centered around his own self-interest.

And then he goes on forming a moral assesment of mankind in general. Point is that a moral understanding of humans is a necessary precondition to develop an economic system, because it defines the goals of such an economic system. How far we can get is only half the problem; which direction we should go is the other one, and that a moral choice.

&gt;It widens the gap between countries and does not help the poor at all.

It's irrelevant to what Google can bring them. And my own web sites will never be pay-walls. Newspapers should be able to find a way to monetize all the content and users that Google provides for free.

If you were to separate Europe vertically in 3 blocks with that point in the middle then yes, basically only Russia and Eastern Ukraine would be in the eastern third and 'Eastern Europe' as a term that would refer to the technical easternmost third is pretty close to useless.

Colloquialism always wins over technicality when it comes to how most people end up referring to things. And the colloquial Western/Eastern European divide is based mostly on the economic discrepancy between the two sides which is biggest on the Poland/Germany and Austria/Hungary borders. 

That and the fact that Europe has been for a long time heavily shifted West from a cultural perspective. Portugal, Spain and even Iceland are ""heavier"" than some rock on Novaya Zemlya or in the Urals which gives this slight illusion that Europe ends where Russia's cultural area of the country ends, rather than where it actually does. Same principle applies to the Midwest example that I gave, it comes down to cultural influence and the movement of cultural influence at the time that the term was adoped rather than pure geography.

That's how it is, outside of academia language is much more alive and chaotic and doesn't give a shit about predefinitions. That's why if you're taken by force by someone, even if you're 50, you're still **kid**napped. Common speech affects definitions more than the other way around

I guess you would have no problem with prominent Russian politicians on ground in, say London or Washington, supporting the protesters which wanted to oust Cameron or Obama.

&gt;Those were directly in response and tied to the violence against the citizens and could be lifted by simply stopping that violence. But you're not kidding me: the Russian actions came after their straw man antagonized the Ukrainian citizens so much he was chased out of his palace.

That is still economic coercion. Europe could have then sit idly by and waited for Ukrainians to oust him themselves, set up monitored elections and then negotiated with the newly elected representatives. But the EU chose economic coercion, support for protesters and to deal with the illegal interim government.

Russia responded accordingly.

&gt;About the memorandum: Russia violated points 1, 2 and 3 directly and repeatedly.

Only after the West made the Memo void by breaking it first. You can't break the deal and respect the other side to honor its commitments. 

&gt;Well, Ukraine is a completely different situation too then. Jeeze.

What? How so? Did anyone promise the Ottomans that they would do something, and did Ottoman Empire dissolve after being given such assurances? Did the first party then break such a deal, which would allow the Ottomans to react? No.

&gt;So otherwise they would have started a war? I completely support that lie then.

They wouldn't have started a war, but the USSR wouldn't have dissolved for a long time. If you support the lie, then you have to accept that the Russian retribution for that lie is not unprompted.

&gt;It's like promising a guy you're not going to seduce his girlfriend: if his girlfriend breaks up with, you're not breaking your promise by seducing her after that fact.

No, it's more like promising a guy there is absolutely no way that you are going to seduce his girlfriend whatsoever, and when he leaves his girlfriend precisely *because* of that promise, you then swoop in and seduce his girlfriend. Then you get upset that the other guy gets mad.

It was planned to build at least 1.000 kilometers per year, but only half that quota could be reached. From 1940 on, forced labour was used, and 1942 all construction efforts came to a halt. The general wages from 1933 to 1939 kept staying below the level of even 1929.

After all, the money then came from a ponzi-scheme called 'Mefo-Wechsel' which were essentially promissory notes issued by the state in lieu of real money. It would have collapsed entirely had the war not been started and war economy been introduced.

I believe that if the waste issue could be solved, the technology is safe enough. Europe isn't on any tectonic rifts, we don't get tidal waves, and enough oversight should negate the issues of people attempting cost-cutting and low-bidding for such management contracts.

And I think there should be nationwide, if not Europe-wide facilities in place to remove radioactive waste from being an issue. Take some tax money, an old coal mine, and bury the entire problem under a million tonnes of concrete. Repeat as needed....

I quite like the idea of burying it in tectonic subduction zones, so over thousands of years it's sucked down into the Earth's outer mantle, where it would be radioactively inert by the time it re-emerges. A very cynical voice in my head suggests dumping waste in areas we've already accidentally made radioactive, as the damage is already done. I don't really have a guess as to the volume of waste we're talking about though.

Coal is by far the cheapest power source still, end-to-end, but this won't necessarily remain true in future. If the taxes for emissions rise, these companies will be left with ""waste"" which is difficult to store and expensive to deal with. In fact, the smoke from a coal power station is more radioactive than the waste from a nuclear power station (citation needed). Carbon capture systems are seriously expansive, and there is still not enough pressure on companies to seriously use them.

End-user cost is a somewhat variable feature through all this. I would never expect prices to go down, but they may not rise as quickly. At the very least, having nuclear in the mix would add slightly more competition to the marketplace. (cue tin foil hat price fixing ""conspiracies""). 

The south of England was entirely forest before Henry VIII decided he needed a navy built of a large amount of wood, but the people of today would really prefer less air pollution from burning things, I think.

After all this, I'm basically not convinced that the other ""renewable"" power generation methods are able to fill the power requirement gap. I want electric cars, trains, etc etc to be powered without a dependence on turning fossil fuels into the air we're breathing. We actually have electric cars now, but we're waiting on the switch to more eco-electricity.

According to you, every economic deal and every economic contract ever made in the history of mankind is economic coercion.

Do you understand how contracts work?

Contract:

&gt;Party 1 says it will do thing #1, if party 2 does thing #2.

If either side breaks their commitment, the contract is void and the other party doesn't have to honor its part of the deal.

That's like saying EU cutting subsidies to a country because that country doesn't honor the ascension agreement, trade deal or similar, is economic coercion.

&gt; c) While shutting out inepdendent observers

You're clinging to this shit again. The observers were invited, and they refused to show up. You're stuck on them turning away military observers, which are completely different from referendum observers.

&gt;It's their country. It's why NATO doesn't invade Russia even though it's stripping away the rights of it's citizens in the name of nationalist protection policies.

Russians, as all peoples, have the right to self-determination. Russians in Russia seem to be pretty content with what Putin is doing.

&gt;For goodness sake the findings of the OSCE are literally open to everyone everywhere. It was created as a forum for international impartiality and communication during the cold war. Russia has availed of the services several times. But now you are discrediting a renowned, impartial organization because it suits your political aims.

Okay, fine. Let's say they are impartial. You're still mixing military observers and referendum observers.

You can't say that Russians turned away referendum observers, which they in fact invited, just because they turned down a completely different group of people with completely different goals — the military observers.

Fertig geschwallt? Laber doch lieber in deinen Threads weiter, wo du abgehauen bist? Muss ich wieder Links aufzählen? So, gut. Dann bin ich ja wieder dran. Trolle müssen ja auch ab und zu gefütert werden, damit sie nicht verhungern:

Es ist bei dem Thema ein ziemlicher Unterschied in der Argumentations- und Sichtweise, ob man den Terrortourismus zulässt/unterstützt um, wie du sagst, ""Assad durch westliche ""Proxies(ISIS, Al Nusra, Al Quaeda etc. zusammengefasst FSA)"" zu stürzen"", oder weil die Diskussion wegen der [kontrovers diskutieren Rechtsgrundlage und fragwürdiger Effektivität](http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-09/islamischer-staat-syrien-rueckkehrer-terrorcamp-gesetz-89a) in der Umsetzung (auch auf EU-Ebene) vermieden wurde - beziehungsweise, weil die Ausreise von potentiellen Touristen vermeintlich verlockend für die Sicherheitslage war - wie im Artikel ausgesagt.

Ich hab damals im Thread bereits gesagt, dass entsprechende Argumentationen bzgl sicherheitspolitischen und der von dir ausgedrückten außenpolitischen Nutzen der Terrorausreisenden unsinnig sind, da Terrortourismus eigentlich in schlimmerer Form [re-importiert](http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-09/islamischer-staat-syrien-rueckkehrer-terrorcamp-gesetz-89a) wird. In Zahlen macht das aktuell 130+ Terroristen aus Syrien.

Weil der (Denk-)Fehler somit dadurch auch dem letzten zurückgebliebenen/hardlinerischen Sicherheitspolitiker klar sein müsste und nun akute Angst vor dem drohenden Re-Import des Terrors besteht, wird bei dem Thema schon seit locker einem Jahr ganz eine effektivere Neuregelung in adäquatem gesetzlichen Rahmen angestrebt. Wird sich zeigen, was da rechtsstaatlich überhaupt geht. Schließlich soll hier kein Guantanamo lite entstehen, wo einreisende Muslime oder eigentlich unschuldige, aber als Terorristen Verdächtigte festsitzen. Vielleicht willst du das aber auch, du hetzt ja hier ständig gegen deine sog. ""Mohameddaner"".

Jedenfalls: Was du zu alledem sagst ist nichts anderes wie ""Der Westen unterstützt Terroristen (=FSA) um Assad zu stürzen, es gibt keine moderaten Rebellen und wir schicken extra all unsere Dschihadisten runter, weil die Kämpfer brauchen: und mit denen stürzt der Westen dann Assad."". Denn sage und schreibe **[450](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm_dS-wEFvs)** Kämpfer mehr in Syrien und Irak sind mehr potentielle Terroranschläge in den nächsten Jahren/Jahrzehnten in der BRD wert. Ja, na sicher doch :D

Dass das gegen die innerstaatlichen Sicherheitsinteressen der BRD geht und deshalb jetzt auf Regierungsebene diskutiert wird -und noch dazu die gesamtwestlichen Sicherheits und Stabilitätsinteressen bezgl dem Nation Building im Irak und Afghanisten gefährdet- interessiert dich nicht. Wozu auch, denn das würde die eigene, radikale Sichtweise dann ja kaputt relativieren. Auch die kürzlich verabschiedete [UN Resolution](http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2178%20%282014%29) -initiiert durch die USA, die du ja wahrscheinlich zumindest implizit als eine Art ""Schattenregierung"" der BRD betrachtest-, durch die vielleicht eine völkerrechtliche Rechtsgrundlage bezüglich der effektiveren Bekämpfung von Terrorrtourismus geschaffen werden könnte, ist wohl eher unwichtig. 

Und mit Differenzieren kann man nicht Pöbeln, und ohne Reaktionen auf sein eigenes Pöbeln (actio=reactio) kann man sich nicht als In-die-Ecke-Gedrängten inszenieren um **noch mehr** zu Pöbeln :D

false,MauvaisConseil,FRAN,France,"&gt; You mean that the demand for their products isn't very elastic? 

Exactly.  German price elasticity is small. Especially for exports outside of the eurozone. German capital goods exports tend to 
be high quality goods that compete more on quality than on price.

&gt;The burden of proof is on you if you insist, since you claimed first that it did.

Nope, /u/SlyRatchet claimed that euro brought growth. I already showed the different growth rates between eurozone and UK+US.

&gt;But I prefer to ignore it because ""what would have happened if..."" is purely speculative and just ends up projecting our preconception on our speculations.

So we are supposed to take your word and never contradict the ""euro brought growth"" claim ?

As I said, the euro looks more and more like a religion. We have to believe in it, not think about it...

&gt;Goods prices did converge, anyway

Nope, there's been persistent inflation differentials and, as a result, large cumulative changes in relative prices.

*The divergence in spending and output growth has
been paralleled by divergence in production costs and
price levels. Unit labour costs, displayed again for the
1999-2008 period in Figure 2, were constant in
Germany while increasing by nearly 40 percent in
Spain. A similar picture is obtained for the other
GIPS countries and alternative measures of the price
level.*

*Since the European Central Bank has roughly
kept to its inflation target of (close to) 2 percent for
the aggregate eurozone, the GIPS countries have
clearly overshot this target while Germany’s inflation
rate was accordingly lower. *

&gt;If you're not eating your vegetables I'm not going to force-feed them to you

Lowering the level of debate even more...

Do you realize how ridiculous you sound ?

&gt;What? Then we should have divided France too..

France did not invade Germany in 1870, 1914 and 1940... It was the other way around my dear.

&gt;Hah! Ask Ukraine about that.

So the EU deal caused a war, it did not prevent it. EU did not bring peace as /u/SlyRatchet  said...

How far we can get is only half the problem; which direction we should go is the other one, and that a moral choice.

Those EU member states which amassed  levels of public debt way beyond 80% got there by loaning their way through decades of ""no austerity"" budgets.  That should be food for thought.

false,dances_with_unicorns,UNSA,USA,"Speaking as an American who has a German mother and is working at a German university: It's not as simple as you think it is.

1. Programs that are in high demand have quotas for non-EU foreigners; it's not as though these are going to be overrun.
2. While there are no tuition fees at German universities, you still have to support yourself, have to be fluent in German for pretty much any undergraduate program [1], and meet admission requirements (an American high school degree is most empathically NOT the equivalent of a German matriculation exam). In short, it requires a non-trivial level of commitment and effort that can create a very real barrier to entry. Just consider the years of study that a B2/C1 level of fluency in German requires (unless, like me, you were raised bilingually).
3. While the average cost per student is around €7,000 per year, most of that is fixed costs; the variable per student costs are actually pretty low.
4. Students who do get admitted are also fairly likely to stay for at least a few years after getting their degree. Not all of them will, but enough to probably bring in more than the variable per student costs in terms of taxes that they pay.
5. Many foreign students come from developing countries. Getting them degrees is essentially another form of foreign aid, and a pretty good one (""teach a man to fish ..."").

[1] There are many English language graduate program; in fact, I'm teaching graduate courses in English myself.

&gt;

&gt;The __Scoville scale__ is the [measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement) of the [pungency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pungency) ([spicy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice) [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat)) of [chili peppers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper) or other spicy foods as reported in Scoville heat units (SHU),  a function of [capsaicin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin) concentration The scale is named after its creator, American pharmacist [Wilbur Scoville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilbur_Scoville). His method, devised in 1912, is known as the Scoville Organoleptic Test. 

&gt;The Scoville scale is an empirical measurement dependent on the capsaicin sensitivity of testers and so is not a precise or accurate method to measure [capsaicinoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin) concentration, however, capsaicin concentration can very roughly be estimated as ~18 µg/gram/SHU.

You are offering them special rates if they do what you want, and threatening them when they don't. It's coercion through energy supply. The fact that the coercion revolves around a trade aggreement is meaningless; sanctions are a form of trade agreement for goodness sake, an agreement to withold trade or impose restrictions. It doen't change the intent or the effect of the coercion. End of story.

&gt; You're clinging to this shit again. The observers were invited, and they refused to show up. You're stuck on them turning away military observers, which are completely different from referendum observers.

I'm just going to repeat what I wrote last time because I'm sick of typing it out for you to disregard:

&gt; Because if you couldn't do it

&gt; a) Under armed invasion 

&gt; b) Under a week's notice 

&gt; c) While shutting out inepdendent observers 

&gt; d) While offering only JOIN RUSSIA or BECOME INDEPENDENT and no MAINTAIN STATUS QUO option 

&gt; e) While rigging the results

&gt;You would not have been able to pass the referendum. You know this.

The only reason you didn't wait is because under a legitimate referendum Russia would not have been able to annex Crimea.

&gt; Russians, as all peoples, have the right to self-determination.

Although apparently not Ukranians when that right conflicts with Russia's interests. Apparently *then* that gives Russians the right to insult every other nation in the west, saying this is their doing, while invading Ukraine.

&gt; Russians in Russia seem to be pretty content with what Putin is doing.

That's their cross to bear.

&gt; Okay, fine. Let's say they are impartial.

There's no ""let's say"" about this; they *are* impartial and you were wrong to suggest otherwise, and had this been about a conflict in North Korea you wouldn't be calling their integrity into question. They're not working for anyone, no matter how much you apparently want them to.

&gt; You can't say that Russians turned away referendum observers, which they in fact invited, just because they turned down a completely different group of people with completely different goals — the military observers.

Why did they turn away - sorry, *shoot at* - independent military observers? There are *juntas in Africa* that don't shoot at the OSCE. 

&gt; Can you upload that check which has Putin to Yanukovych written on it that you have in your possession?

How is this in response to the statement:

&gt; Besides, if Ukrainians wanted to oust Yanukovych they could have done it themselves

&gt; They did.

Explain that to me.

&gt; Threats to impose sanctions, which I linked you to numerous times.

Oh you meant **this:**

&gt;  Europe's leaders are to consider urgent sanctions against Ukraine after the worst violence in months of unrest claimed at least 26 lives.

&gt; At a joint news conference, French President Francois Hollande said those responsible for the violence ""will be sanctioned"" at an emergency meeting due to take place on Thursday, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed the threat, saying they were ""side by side with the men and women who suffer"". 

&gt; The EU has agreed to impose travel bans and asset freezes on Ukrainian officials “with blood on their hands” but leave the door open for continued diplomacy it was decided yesterday. 

&gt; Up to 20 interior ministry and security officials or “those responsible for violence and use of excessive force” will be targeted in what is being posited as a first message to the Ukrainian authorities.

Yes, that's *clearly* for the benefit of the EU and not to protect the citizens of the Ukraine from a purchased President that is *killing them.* **That's not influencing internal policy you moron, that's asking a president to stop killing his people. There's no legislation in Ukraine that permits this violence or death, that's the fucking point.**

""Actors and actresses""? As far as I'm aware it's mostly just actresses. Which is pretty much the reason why the entire thing even warrants attention. When young, white, attractive females are wronged, there will be someone somewhere on the internet rushing to defend them.

Na *dann*  würd ich aber nochmal lesen. Bei allem Respekt, aber nichts davon kann ich auch im Geringsten nachvollziehen.

Im letzten Thread gings darum, dass Terrorexport und dessen Re-Import laut mir nicht im Interesse der Bundesregierung sein *kann*. Das belege ich in diesem Thread durch die Tatsache, dass die Überlegung zu versuchen, eine **neue** Rechtsgrundlage zur präventiven Festnahme Terrorverdächtiger bereits lange besteht, aber wohl eher  kaum effektiv und gleichzeitig rechtsstaatlich umsetzbar ist.

Krawall bezieht sich auf den Submission-Artikel, in dem ausgesagt wird, dass aufgrund der naiven Vorstellung, einheimische Sicherheitsinteressen durch die Ausreise ohne Wiedereinreise (Konflikt mit der Realität) von Terroristen schützen zu können, aber **auch wegen er mangelnden rechtsstaatlichen Grundlage**, während er im verlinkten Thread die These aufstellt, dass die Bundesregierung, Terroristen deshalb ausreisen lässt, weil sie ja gegen Assad kämpfen und wir den ja unbedingt weghaben wollen. Dem halte ich die gegenüber den Teilnehmerzahlen im Syrischen Bürgerkrieg  relativ insignifikante Zahl an Terrortouristen und deren große Rückkehrzahl entgegen, aufgrund dessen es vielleicht im grundlegenden Interesse der Bundesregierung sein kann, Assad wegzuhaben, **aber garantiert nicht um den Preis**, Terror und Instabiliät in dem Maß zu re-importieren. Das könne jeder Vollidiot und auch eben zb jeder noch so verkappte Hardliner erkennen. Von daher kann Krawalls Deutungsmuster nicht zutreffend sein.

McCain wasn't in Moscow, he was in Ukraine. I wouldn't have a problem with, let's say Zhirinovsky, showing his face in Kiev. As long as he isn't armed.

&gt;That is still economic coercion.

No. It doesn't affect the economy of Ukraine, it mostly inconveniences a few specific persons and could be stopped at any time by simply not shooting their own citizens.

&gt;Europe could have then sit idly by and waited for Ukrainians to oust him themselves, set up monitored elections and then negotiated with the newly elected representatives.

You must be enormously impressed by the EU's power when you think three speeches and cancelling the holiday plans of some politicians makes more than a symbolic impact.

&gt;Russia responded accordingly.

You don't understand the word ""accordingly"". Did Russia let a few officials express their support and sanction a few dozen Ukrainian politicians then? No, they sent thousands of soldiers, annexed a province and have killed thousands. That's like blowing up a bar because you think a guy looked at you funny.

&gt;Only after the West made the Memo void by breaking it first.

No, the West didn't break the Budapest memorandum. Even if you think that delaying the Trois Suisses orders of the wives of some politicians counts as economic coercion, then certainly Russia's threat of using the gas tap predates and exceeds them vastly on that count. And then we're not even talking yet about points 1 and 2 (Respect Ukrainian independence and sovereignty within its existing borders.
Refrain from the threat or use of force against Ukraine.).

&gt;What? How so?

You can't claim ""it's different"" whenever something doesn't suit you. Past empires don't support current claims, period. Or else Moscow would be French.

&gt;They wouldn't have started a war, but the USSR wouldn't have dissolved for a long time.

If you say that it contributed to a peaceful dissolution then you say that it would have been war without. But in any case we are not responsible for the wars the Russian government starts. We can only attempt to calm the madmen down.

&gt;If you support the lie, then you have to accept that the Russian retribution for that lie is not unprompted.

No. We had to pack up the truth diplomatically so some people with hurt feelings about lost empires wouldn't start stupid wars.

No, it isn't. It has nothing to do with intelligence. It's just like if robbers broke into a person's house and stole their nude physical photos, or their money, or their personal possessions. We must live assuming that society offers us some degree of protection in the matters that we don't understand, or otherwise we wouldn't be able to take a single step without fear.

&gt; Nobody should be taking naked pictures of themselves unless they are comfortable with or (at the very least) prepared to deal with the possibility that it could be public information.

Equivalent to: ""nobody should have anything of value in their house unless they are comfortable with it being stolen"", or ""nobody should sleep without a weapon unless they are comfortable with being murdered at night"". Those people are the victims of a crime, plain and simple; it's the same as the people who are robbed unaware of just how vulnerable the practical totality of door locks are.

You just happen to have a different sphere of knowledge to theirs, and in this case you are aware of the dangers of technology. When you buy a drug, do you spend months or years carefully researching all the ingredients and the chemistry between them? or do you trust society in that what is sold to you is safe as long as used within the specified parameters? Well those people used a product within the specifications, and they were burned nonetheless; how ""stupid"" of them.

&gt; ""Actors and actresses""? As far as I'm aware it's mostly just actresses. Which is pretty much the reason why the entire thing even warrants attention. When young, white, attractive females are wronged, there will be someone somewhere on the internet rushing to defend them.

Are you trying to turn this into a SJW strawman? because my arguments are exactly the same for male and female victims. At any point did I make a distinction, and I would be writing these exact same lines had this happened to men.

&gt; A word which implies that a victim should not be expected in any way to assume any sort of responsibility for their own safety and well-being if it is within their capacity to do so.

false,Krawall2,null,null,"Du könntest dich auch über eine Whatsapp oder eine SMS bewerben, trotzdem macht das keiner. Das hat prinzipiell etwas mit dem Medium zu tun und den Vorurteilen die speziell ältere Personaler diesen gegenüber haben. 

Die meisten merken das ja auch an sich selbst, während man in einer Kurznachricht damit durchkommt irgendwelche Abkürzungen zu verwenden, tut man dies in einer Email komischerweise eher selten(zumindest die älteren Semester, wie es bei den Jungen aussieht, keine Ahnung). Man gibt sich dort schlicht mehr Mühe.

Aus dem selben Grund blicken viele auch auf dieses Medium hinab. Es steht in der Wertung unter dem Brief oder der Schriftform, es ist eine Art Wertschätzung dem ein Papier zu schicken und entgegen der landläufigen Meinung werden diese auch oft gelesen. Den ganzen Tag vor dem Rechner hocken, da ist eine Bewerbung auf echtem Papier schon mal eine Abwechslung.

Klar bedeutet das mehr Umstand für den Bewerber und ich würde auch nicht empfehlen dies auf Stellen zu tun die du suchst, also Nebenjobs etc. Dort gilt wie ich bereits schrieb sowieso first come first serve. Die wollen da niemanden der persönlich geeignet ist, sondern jemanden der einfach die Arbeit macht und fertig. Tut er sie nicht wird der rausgeschmissen und der Nächste eingestellt. Das ist für die meisten Firmen die solche Jobs anbieten überhaupt kein Umstand.

Du magst nicht zu den Verzweifelten gehören, der Großteil der Bewerber auf solche Stellen, meist niedrig qualifiziert, ist aber genau das. Ebenso werden die auch behandelt. Der AG weiß, dass die einen Job wollen oder brauchen und sitzt deshalb in der Machtposition. Du willst etwas von ihm und neben dir wollen das noch tausende andere. 

Das bringen die Inserate bei der Agentur so mit sich, da bewerben sich mitunter zwangsweise immer hunderte drauf. Jemand der keine Ahnung hat wie er zu Arbeit kommen soll geht wo hin? Zur Arge. Jemand der keinen Bock hat arbeiten zu gehen wird durch wen vermittelt? Die Arge, an Firmen die dort inserieren. 

So ist es überall wo man Menschenmaterial und keine Persönlichkeiten braucht. Baugewerbe, Sicherheitsbranche, Transport etc. Wenn man könnte würd man das alles durch Roboter erledigen lassen, der Mensch ist da nur Material. Die Versicherung schreibt bspw. vor, dass du an dem Objekt mindestens 2 Wachmänner haben musst, die müssen eine bestimmte Qualifikation haben etc. Ist dies nicht vorhanden, zahlst du höhere Prämien oder kriegst dein Objekt nicht versichert. 

Die Mitarbeiter selber interessieren dort niemanden. Wo die essen, wie die ihre Pause machen, ob eine Toilette vorhanden ist. Wichtig ist das Papier, welches nachweist das dort 2 ausgebildete Wachleute anwesend sind.

Oder im Transport. Jemand wird gesucht, der einen bestimmten Führerschein hat und einen LKW von A nach B bringt. Es interessiert den AG nicht ob der lesen und schreiben kann. Es interessiert ihn nicht ob die Route gut geplant ist, genug Zeit für Toilettengänge drin ist, oder ob der Fahrer betrunken zum Dienst erscheint oder rast. 

Ist eh alles versichert, aus der Haftung ist der raus. Er braucht Material, keinen Menschen.

Eine Anekdote eines Bereichsleiters dazu:

Die Versicherung schrieb für einen Generatorraum eine stündliche Überprüfung des Verschlusszustandes vor, sprich Klinke drücken, gucken ob die Tür noch verschlossen ist. Ohne diese Überprüfung kostet die Versicherungsprämie(keine echten Zahlen) 10000€ monatlich, mit dieser Überprüfung nur 8000€. Was macht also der Bereichsleiter? Stellt sich einen Subunternehmer an, der jemanden auf einem Stuhl vor diese Tür setzt, Klemmbrett in der Hand und dann jede Stunde die Klinke drückt und dies auf einem Formular abzeichnet. Kosten für den Mitarbeiter pro Monat: 400€. War Aufstocker, wurde nach 6 Monaten gefeuert und ein neuer Aufstocker eingestellt. 

Zahlen tut man also nur noch 8400€ gesamt, Ersparnis 1600€. Glaubst du irgendwen interessiert die Bewerbung von der Person die dann da vor sitzt? Keine Sau. Wo findet man solche Inserate? Arbeitsamt.

Menschenmaterial eben. Genau so geht man auch mit den Bewerbern um. ",0,1412261335,null,0,false,0,ckyf6sa,t3_2i300k,t1_ckyf6sa,t1_ckye7es,null,1426719587,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

If you would, nuclear energy would be way more expensive than other forms of energy - probably not even economically reasonable.

But what if the same analysis is done for fossil fuels? There are lots of costs (and health problems) associated with fossil that have just been historically ignored. Nuclear doesn't have that luxury simply because it's new and the populace is paranoid about it. Is nuclear still more costly in that case?

I've generally been pro-nuclear because even in the worst nuclear disasters, the environmental and health damage is localized to within a few tens of kilometers of the plant. Fossil is causing global damage.

You are absolutely correct on the waste issue though.

Er behauptet es gebe eine Stallorder genau dies zu tun. 

Nun kommt heraus das es nicht nur die Stallorder gab, sondern die Terroristen sogar bei der Ausreise unterstützt wurden, da man die lieber woanders ihre Anschläge begehen sehen wollte. Das ist genau das, was Krawall geschrieben hat. Ob die nun billigend in Kauf nahmen, dass die in Syrien Anschläge verübten oder dies wirklich wollten spielt dabei keine Rolle. Sie wussten was die vorhatten und haben es geschehen lassen. Im Strafrecht wären wir schon bei der Beihilfe. 

Verwässern tust dein Argument damit, dass du eine Rechtfertigung dafür suchst. Ob es nun im Interesse der BRD liegt oder nicht spielt keine Rolle, nachdem du kategorisch ausgeschlossen hast, dass die BRD das tut. Auch spekulierst du nur welche Absicht die BRD haben könnte, bzw. vermutest dass sie dies nie um den Preis getan hätte den Terror wieder nach Hause zu holen. Das hat alles nichts damit zu tun, dass die BRD Terroristen bei der Ausreise unterstützt hat, aus welchem Grund auch immer. Auch der Re-import wird schon eingepreist sein oder willst du behaupten die BRD ließ die Terroristen ziehen ohne die Möglichkeit bedacht zu haben, dass die zurück kommen?  

Auch erscheint mir der Grund einer Schwächung Assads als Haupt- oder Nebenfolge wesentlich logischer. Terroristen woanders Terroristen sein lassen zu wollen klingt nach Ausrede, speziell da sich die Gefahr, dass die bewaffnet, ausgebildet und radikalisert zurückkommen ja wesentlich höher ist.

No, not 'integration', I'm talking about knowing the difference between Edeka and Netto (without seeing either) and knowing how to sort out your insurances and rental paperwork... actual useful things prior to the 'trial by fire' method.

* Whilst young mothers (both expats and German) are the most annoying fuckers on my FB or social circles, I would like all expectant mothers to receive a 'baby-box' similar to the system they have in place in Germany. And possibly a flyer about how to shut up about having a kid... just to balance things.

* Actually have Germany's inter-state and international policing fixed. Sounds boring but honestly, no-one in different states talks to each other to share intelligence. And that's before considering the sorry state of the forensics departments...

* Remove blanket censorship on certain films/games... if someone is over 30 then surely they can be responsible while seeing blood in their horror/warfare game.

* Tourists in groups of more than four must stand at least 1m apart, as they're annoying as hell when grouped like files around shite in public areas or exhibits.

*  Immediately commission research into why there are so many people in Berlin (seemingly functional) that talk to themselves!! It's getting ridiculous as I'm catching other expats doing it now too.

* Additional research will be required by technical institutions to test and implement a staring competition tracking scoreboard for each individual city, in order to make staring at strangers a useful attribute and generate a sense of belonging between city denizens. 

* And just because something doesn't match 'the rules' (in whatever respective regard), then as long as a case can be argued coherently with good supporting evidence, then perhaps a change in the rules is required... a little more dynamism needed here.

It's not a proposition of the FN... Another lie. The FN's proposition is to reduce the incoming flow of immigrants to 10 000 per year. Foreigners that are legally in France will stay in France.

No one is proposing to enforce patriotism... You can keep saying bullshit but that does not make it true.

In fact you're criticizing something that you don't know, just like you did in our previous conversation.

&gt;The most powerful country in the world right now grew up so fast because of immigration

Because all countries are supposed to behave the same way...

Remember that population in France was 28 millions in 1800, 38 millions en 1900, and 65,7 millions in 2014. In the US, it was 3 millions in 1800, 75 millions in 1900, and 314 millions in 2014. For Australia it was 5200 in 1800, 4 millions in 1900 and 22,7 millions in 2014.

Different policies for different countries.

&gt;But closing all doors just like that isn't exactly some kind of miracle solution.

No one pretends that it's a miracle solution.

A big part of our immigration comes from Maghreb, Turkey and some parts of Africa where people have low school results, live in closed communities with many children. Studies show that they have very different backgrounds when it comes to [marrying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage#Current_status), having children and [educating](http://www.ined.fr/fichier/t_telechargement/63608/telechargement_fichier_fr_insee.r.f.rences.pdf) them. People from Asia and OECD countries score higher in school and integrate well (low unemployment and high mixed marriages)

This leads to very different results when it comes to [the cost of immigration](http://www.oecd.org/els/mig/imo2013.htm) : immigrants benefit OECD countries, except Germany and France, where they cost 0,52% of GDP each year.

&gt; Photo de Femen en en-tête

Déjà, Femen =/= féminisme. Le groupe a bougé idéologiquement, surtout depuis qu'on a offert l'asile à cette sociopathe de Shevchenko. Maintenant, Femen est au féminisme ce qu'Action Directe est à la gauche: des radicaux qui mixent toutes les idéologies qui trouvent et font du terrorisme au nom du ""progrès"".

&gt; Comme vous avez pu entendre, cette conne de Kelly Brook avoue publiquement avoir violenter deux de ses anciens petits amis et celle-ci, avec l’animateur, osent en rire… 

C'est un vrai problème. La plupart des féministes te diront que c'est la faute du système moderne qu'ils appellent Patriarchie et qui fixe des règles genrées pour les hommes comme pour les femmes, et que même si les hommes sont généralement dominants dans le système, ils souffrent particulièrement de la règle interdisant aux hommes de souffrir ou de montrer de l'émotion sous peine d'être traités de lopettes.

Je ne suis pas d'accord avec cette analyse, tout d'abord parce que je ne suis pas d'accord avec l'analyse de la Patriarchie et ensuite parce que la plupart des groupes féministes qu'il m'a été donné de lire affichent un mépris étonnant pour les problèmes des hommes. Leurs réactions se découpent en deux: ""Lol what about the men"" et ""On s'occupe d'abord des femmes, les problèmes des hommes se résoudront après!"" (Par magie?)

&gt; problème avec le fait d’avoir associés majoritairement ces valeurs à la femme par ces groupes, c’est le monté aux barricades contre les hommes. Jamais on entend dire  »Une lesbienne n’a pas respecté le corps de la femme » ou bien  »Une fille n’a pas respecté le corps de l’homme », le seul et unique discours qu’on entend est celui-ci :  »L’homme n’a pas respecté le corps de la femme ». 

...Si en fait, on l'entend. Les stats commencent à sortir, il y a autant sinon plus de violences conjugales parmi les couples gays (tous genres confondus) que parmi les couples hétéros (aux US, en tout cas). On en parle, des groupes comme les Canadiens de CAFE sortent du bois. Les groupes féministes sont peut-être pas le fer de lance du débat autour des problèmes des hommes, mais *ils n'ont pas à l'être*. Si vous voulez participer à une cause pareille, rejoignez des groupes MRAs ou *egalitarians*, n'attendez pas que les féminites le fassent pour vous.

&gt; féminisme extrémiste  
&gt; vagins sableux  
&gt; mentalité à victimiser la femme et culpabiliser l’homme  
&gt; Mange de la marde féminisme, retourne à tes racines et cesse ton putain d’égoïsme.

C'est clair qu'avec un débat apaisé et factuel comme ça, on va grave avoir l'occasion de faire avancer le schmilblick. /s

To allow them to diffuse that propaganda unhindered gives it an air of legitimacy. Combating this is the very least the EU could do and they can't manage it, lest German households see a few extra cent on their gas bill and Dr. Merkel's popularity is dented. It's disgraceful.

Das ist genau das, was Krawall geschrieben hat. Ob die nun billigend in Kauf nahmen, dass die in Syrien Anschläge verübten oder dies wirklich wollten spielt dabei keine Rolle. Sie wussten was die vorhatten und haben es geschehen lassen. Im Strafrecht wären wir schon bei der Beihilfe.

* ist dazu das Prinzip Cui Bono erfolgreich angewandt gewesen, da man um zu dem Schluss zu kommen, dass Terrorexport im Interesse der BRD ist, argumentativ in der Abwägung den Re-Import weglassen müsste. Von kann man davon ausgehen, dass die Bundesregierung entweder ihre Interessen unvollständig ergründet hat und wider ihre Interessen gehandelt hat - oder einfach dem Rechtssystem erliegt, welches einen effektiven Ausreisestop prinzipiell verhindert. Oder beides.

* noch ist das laut Krawalls Darstellung dazu getan worden, um Assad zu stürzen und mit Terroristen zu kollaborieren. Denn laut Artikel ging es ja angeblich um die innere Sicherheit - womit wir wieder beim gegen die eigenen Interessen handeln wären. Insofern gibt der Artikel Krawall eben **nicht** Recht. Da ""die Stallorder"" laut Artikel aus einem völlig anderen Grund gegeben wurde.

&gt;Verwässern tust dein Argument damit, dass du eine Rechtfertigung dafür suchst. Ob es nun im Interesse der BRD liegt oder nicht spielt keine Rolle

Ich suche keine Rechtfertigung. Ich sage, dass Krawall seine Aussage mit der Stallorder durch das Prinzip ""Cui Bono"" im Bezug auf Syrien herleitete, was aber nur funktioniert, wenn man den Re-Import des Terrors unter den Tisch fallen lässt. Der Grund für die Billigung der Ausreise war also ein anderer.

&gt;Verwässern tust dein Argument damit, dass du eine Rechtfertigung dafür suchst. Ob es nun im Interesse der BRD liegt oder nicht spielt keine Rolle, nachdem du kategorisch ausgeschlossen hast, dass die BRD das tut. Auch spekulierst du nur welche Absicht die BRD haben könnte, bzw. vermutest dass sie dies nie um den Preis getan hätte den Terror wieder nach Hause zu holen. Das hat alles nichts damit zu tun, dass die BRD Terroristen bei der Ausreise unterstützt hat, aus welchem Grund auch immer. Auch der Re-import wird schon eingepreist sein oder willst du behaupten die BRD ließ die Terroristen ziehen ohne die Möglichkeit bedacht zu haben, dass die zurück kommen?

&gt;Auch erscheint mir der Grund einer Schwächung Assads als Haupt- oder Nebenfolge wesentlich logischer. Terroristen woanders Terroristen sein lassen zu wollen klingt nach Ausrede, speziell da sich die Gefahr, dass die bewaffnet, ausgebildet und radikalisert zurückkommen ja wesentlich höher ist. Jede Unterstützung in dieser Richtung ist schlicht verwerflich. 

Siehe oben, du hast einfach nicht meine Aussage und meine Argumentation verstanden.

Ich lege jedenfalls zu allererst mal die Sichtweise nahe, dass eine rechtliche Grundlage die die bisherige Situation zufriedenstellend verbessert kaum zu realisieren ist und die kontroverse Debatte um soclh ein heißes Eisen deshalb vermieden wurde. Außerdem war dem Ministerium die Lösung des wegschicken wohl verlockend, da die anscheinend öftere Rück-Einreise radikaler Extremisten wohl anscheinend besser geahndet werden kann. Les dir meine Argumentation mal nochmal durch und was ich *genau* aussage. War wohl auch etwas verschwurbelt, da keine Zeit zum formatieren und kürzen.

Edit: Korrektur und was vergessen:

Der Punkt mit der Interesse Assad wegzuschaffen, ist eben imho der, dass gerade einmal 450 Kämpfer imho ein Nullsummenspiel darstellen, wenn de davon halt wieder 130+ ausgebildeter Dschihadisten ins Land holst. In Syrien sind locker hundertausende Kämpfer aktiv. Was sind da schon ein paar hundert gegen den politischen Fallout nach einer Welle von Terroranschlägen? So blöd kann man ja nicht sein. Das heißt für mich, dass es wahrschheinlich ist, dass man ob der kontroversen Rechtslage und Rechtfertigungsdebatte einer Neuregelung gleich auf die Schiene sprang, dass -wie du bereits sagtest- die Terroristen sich in Syrien aufreiben sollen, da man eh nix machen kann. Die Logik (Ich find das genauso mies, dass wir die Terroristen nicht von der Abreise abhalten. Aber wie willste das rechtlich regeln?) kann man auch gerne kritisieren, da muss man aber andere Ansätze als Krawall nehmen.",0,1412264914,null,0,1412267360,0,ckygzdp,t3_2i2rut,t1_ckygzdp,t1_ckyfwjj,null,1426718678,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

Yeah tell me about it...:D

&gt; I've been to Croatia and have many Bosnian friends in the US.

Yeah Croatian coast is beautiful and I guess those Bosnians are good friends. Generally speaking people from Ex Yu are great to have as friends, warm, easy-going, loyal, they've got your back in any situation.
You should drop by Serbia too, just say you are Canadian. :P :D

Anyway simple answer to your question: Generally Serbians are more pissed off at Croats. No real hard feelings towards Germans. 

A bit more complicated answer on why it is like that:  

Serbians always had a (mostly one-sided) love-hate relationship with Germans. Before world wars, Germany had a great economical and cultural influence on Serbia. Germans who settled here were first beer brewers, first bankers, first sport hunters...They would come here and bring all these new, fancy stuff and trends with them. And Serbs respected them very much. As I showed you, the dude on Serbian 1000 dinar bill is German, I think that says a lot. 

  Then of course things changed radically after the WWI and especially after the WWII. But still Serbians respect German technical prowess, discipline, efficiency, beer and cars. Today, generally, Serbs will have sarcastic comments and will be weary of Germany as a big world power, cause we don't really like big world powers over here :D. But a part from that, hard feelings toward Germany and Germans cause of the WWII are mostly faded and I think only respect remains.

Now as for the Croats, Serbs are still pissed off cause we saw them as brothers trough history and they didn't pass a single opportunity to fuck us up. :D Yeah, most Serbs feel that Croatia never truly repented for the deeds from WWII in same way as Germany did, not even close. And then you add these recent wars, where Serbs mostly fucked things up...and you still have some strong feelings on both sides. But I know out of 50 Croatians that I would to meet, I would have great time with 49 of them, but that 1 would really piss me off or hate me or even physically harm me. Same goes vice versa. We have a lot in common. Chances are that a lot of dudes of my age from Croatia and I listened to same bands, watched same cartoons, read same comics and books, laughed at same jokes and no amount of hate and political fuckery can change those kind of bonds.

la scelta che hai adesso è la seguente (non dirò che è semplice, per me lo è, sono a km da te e dietro un pc con la maturità già fatta, grazie al cazzo che è semplice):

1) te lo tieni, prendi spizzichi e bocconi di storia ""vera"" in mezzo all'oceano di gomblotto

2) lo ""denunci"" al preside. Occhio però: se vai da solo (ma anche con tutta la tua classe compatta) rischi di essere tacciato di rognare perché il rpofessore ti sta antipatico. Quindi: prove, prove, prove. 

Considera inoltre che qualsiasi iniziativa che richieda il supporto dei tuoi compagni ti lascerà da solo, perché spesso e volentieri al momento della resa dei conti si tireranno indietro. A me è successo; fregatene e vai avanti. Al peggio ti possono bocciare (che sembra una tragedia, ma non lo è), ma se le cose arrivano veramente ad essere esacerbate a questo punto? Accusalo di antisemitismo. Non è un'accusa falsa; i suoi discorsi sembrano chiari, gli ebrei stan dietro a tutto e sono cattivi. L'accusa è un jolly però, non giocarla alla leggera.

Se il preside non fa niente, escala. Ma non dopo due mesi. Dopo una settimana. Il vostro problema è che a giugno vi valutano, non tra due anni. Vi serve una soluzione immediata - non rapida. Il preside non ti caga? digli ""vado al provveditorato agli studi"" e VACCI. 

L'unica altra alternativa che puoi avere? studiarti il programma da solo. 

Io ho un temperamento diverso, diciamo che al tuo posto mi rifiuterei di ascoltare lezioni del genere, i miei mi darebberoi manforte, me ne uscirei dalla classe e andre in presidenza a studiare.

The Bosnian friends I have made are great, and we are taking one out to dinner at a place called Dubrovnik for her birthday.  Also, Balkan women are HOT.  Tall and skinny.

Some of the Bosnians I know survived Srebrenica, that was crazy shit.  But most of them do not hate the Serbian people, and want to move on.

I also think it's great how all the Balkan folks (most who came here as refugees) have integrated so well.  This is usually not an issue for any immigrants here, but these people who came here as very young refugees who did not speak English are now doing very well for themselves.  They work at Fortune 500 companies, are phsyical therapists, business people and so on and so forth.  Usually the first generation doesn't do so well like that.

Also, socially, they fit right in, they are NEVER condescending or arrogant.  They work their asses off and are a lot of fun.  They make me feel lazy!  They came here with nothing and have built themselves up, while I had it easy.

So basically, I think they are some of the best Americans around, and we are very lucky to have them here.  I would like a whole bunch more to come here, but maybe that isn't so good for you guys.

As for visiting Serbia, I will one day.  My father went to Belgrade and loved it.  Next summer we plan to go to Sarajevo, maybe we will make it a bigger trip.  


Oh, my favorite story about hanging out with Bosnians was watching Bosnia play in the World Cup when they got cheated out of a goal and lost.  My wife and I were the only people there besides small children not to be born in Bosnia.  When it became clear that Bosnia was not going to win, they started chanting ""USA! USA!"" because that is who they were going to root for now.  It was awesome.

Everything else is irrational nationalism.

The main reason the Eurozone still has problems is because we're applying the same monetary policies with different fiscal policies. The EU is attempting to unify fiscal policies but countries like France keep trying to do their own thing which is very harmful for everyone in the Eurozone.

Zunächst muss man sich registrieren, ein Anschreiben hochladen und diverse Formulare ausfüllen. Der Spaß beginnt, wenn die Formulare schlicht nicht passen, zB für einen Praktikanten ein Dropdownmenü mit den ""Gehaltsvorstellungen"" pflichtausgewählt werden muss, welche unten bei 10k-20k Euro im Jahr beginnen. Das waren mehrere solche Geschichten, die das Ausfüllen zur Tortur gemacht haben, weil man sich natürlich schon fragt, wie man es am geschicktesten interpretiert.

Hat man dann den ganzen Aufwand betrieben, wird man darüber informiert (sinngemäß): ""Jo also wir melden uns dann bei ihnen wenn wir Interesse haben. Sollten wir uns nach 3 Monaten nicht gemeldet haben, tun wir das auch später nicht mehr."" Dieses Versprechen haben sie immerhin gehalten.

Ein Prof hat mir sogar erzählt, er hätte jemanden persönlich in eine Firma vermittelt und von dort kam das Feedback: Davon könnten wir mehr brauchen. Das hatte er dann mal erwähnt, woraufhin 3 Studenten sich meldeten, sie hätten sich ebenfalls dort beworben, nix mit Bedarf. Also teilweise ist das System schon schizophren.

Vermutlich gibt es gar keinen Fachkräftemangel, sondern nur inkompetente bis bösartige Personalabteilungen. 

Also es hat schon etwas gedauert bis ich dann ein kleines Praktikum gefunden hatte, das dann sogar etwas bezahlt wurde... lustigerweise kamen dann nach wochenlanger Suche und Stress innerhalb von 3 Tagen 3 Angebote... 

War eine Initiativbewerbung, ich hatte dort angerufen und der Chef meinte direkt: gucken wir mal, ich melde mich. Nach 3 Monaten ohne Reaktion (wie ich das schon kannte) hab ich dann doch noch einmal - aufgrund drängender Frist zunehmend verzweifelt - dort angerufen. ""Oh, das hatte ich vergessen, ja na klar, machen wir! Kommen Sie doch einfach mal vorbei!""

Also wenn die Form deiner Schreiben so in etwa stimmt und du etwaige Mängel im Lebenslauf einigermaßen kaschieren kannst... Dann hilft nur dranbleiben. Falls vorhanden: unbedingt Connections nutzen. Im Zweifel gerne mal anrufen. Bei ausbleibender Reaktion halt auch zweimal ;)

You can be intelligent and still do stupid things. You can be really good at one thing and be absolutely clueless when dealing with another thing.

&gt; Equivalent to: ""nobody should have anything of value in their house unless they are comfortable with it being stolen"", or ""nobody should sleep without a weapon unless they are comfortable with being murdered at night"".

You can secure your valuables and your person fairly easily and in a way that most people will intuitively understand. Even if you don't, you know that society will be able to deter and punish any would-be murderers and thieves from doing so. When you're discussing information it's not nearly as clear, especially in this day and age. 

For starters, who do we punish? The people who accessed the data illegally? (And how do you prove that?) Or maybe the people circulating these images, who probably number into the tens of millions by now? Are we going to have to draft up new laws requiring consent to view intimate photos? Is that even a good idea? — And so on. 

In short, it's a very fuzzy area legally and you should be somewhat more cautious whenever you're putting yourself in a position where the law won't necessarily be able to help you.

&gt; You just happen to have a different sphere of knowledge to theirs, and in this case you are aware of the dangers of technology.

What exactly is ""their"" sphere of knowledge exactly? Knowing how to look good and pose for the cameras? Are you implying that they should be expected to know nothing else?

&gt; Well those people used a product within the specifications, and they were burned nonetheless; how ""stupid"" of them.

Again, that doesn't meant that the way in which they used it wasn't stupid. They shouldn't have been taking naked pictures of themselves in the first place.

&gt; Are you trying to turn this into a SJW strawman? because my arguments are exactly the same for male and female victims. At any point did I make a distinction, and I would be writing these exact same lines had this happened to men.

No, I'm just stating a fact. The only reason anyone cares *at all* is because they're young, attractive women whose role in society is to be sexually objectified. If they weren't, there wouldn't be hordes of men drooling over pictures of their naked bodies, and there wouldn't be anything to make a fuss over. In *theory*, I would also be writing the same exact lines if it happened to men, but if that were the case, nobody would be talking about it in the first place.

&gt; No, I absolutely wouldn't consider them responsible for what happened.

I'm not saying that they are responsible for what *happened*, I'm saying they should be more responsible about their own data. ",0,1412268456,null,0,false,0,ckyivih,t3_2i2ui8,t1_ckyivih,t1_ckyf474,null,1426717795,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2
false,gagarin90,neckbeard,,"Ciao OP. La mia storia è per certi versi simile alla tua: il mio professore complottista insegnava italiano (e in un liceo classico significa che avevamo una tonnellata di ore alla settimana con lui) ed era di ruolo: è arrivato al terzo anno (o prima liceo come si chiamava allora, Dio che vecchiaia) ed è rimasto fino all fine. 

Quest'uomo era una contraddizione vivente, in quanto oltre ad essere furiosamente complottista (trilateral commission, skull &amp; bones, Rothschild vari tirati in mezzo a ogni piè sospinto) e ultra cattolico, a 60 anni suonati è anche la persona più dotta e curiosa che io abbia mai conosciuto, della serie che poteva parlarti per ore del satanismo occulto dei Led Zeppelin tardo periodo per poi passare in tutta tranquillità a dissertazioni su questo o quell'altro commentatore dantesco e sull'importanza delle sue ricerche filologiche in merito al suono delle rime in questa cantica piuttosto che in quest'altra. Era una vera enciclopedia umana della letteratura, con una notevole appendice dedicata alle cazzate.

Del tipo: diceva che i jeans erano un'invenzione degli ebrei per sterilizzare i cattolici (not joking), frequentava abitualmente gli esorcismi pubblici a cui veniva invitato dai suoi preti di fiducia, diceva di essere amico molto intimo di un Templare che gli aveva rivelato robe che nemmeno Adam Kadmon ed era anche abbastanza negazionista (su questo però si conteneva, perché era stato messo sotto processo una decina d'anni prima, per apologia del fascismo).

Non so esattamente qual'è il punto del mio discorso, ma volevo dirti che lui alla fine è l'unico professore di cui conservo un ricordo positivo. Non perché adesso creda che i massoni stiano cercando di sterilizzarmi mettendo sul mercato jeans sempre più stretti (hipster, sveglia!1!!!), ma perché a un certo punto ho iniziato ad ammirare la fierezza con cui quest'uomo (che tra l'altro era la persona più gentile ed educata del mondo) sostenesse i propri ideali. Cioè tutti gli ridevano in faccia (anche i suoi colleghi, tra cui un deficiente ignorantone che si vantava di aver votato Giuliano Ferrara alle elezioni), ma lui con tutta la calma del mondo ti spiegava il suo punto di vista citando miliardi di autori e titoli (ricordiamo la celebre Nesta Webster, giamaicana autrice di una monumentale storia della massoneria).

Quindi OP, tieni duro, impara quello che puoi e magari cerca di trovare il giusto compromesso tra il fare contento il tuo prof e il non scrivere cagate esoteriste in terza prova. Nella mia esperienza parlare con il professore non cambia niente. Tra l'altro tu hai 18 anni e zero esperienza, lui può intortare te, i tuoi parenti e i suoi superiori come meglio crede, senza contare che in qualsiasi confronto la tua parola varrà sempre nulla contro la sua. Tenerselo buono in questo modo è un ottimo allenamento per il tuo senso critico.

Unfair: Current borders

Fair: Expansion of borders to include majority Hungarians areas while still being contiguous

Ambitious: Szekerland, a Hungarian-majority exclave in Transylvania (Romania). It is not connected to Hungary by a majority ethnic area, making any argument for transferring it to Hungary difficult, but not impossible. It would make it similar to Kaliningrad and Russia in this regard.

Problem: Small pockets of majority Hungarians distributed throughout Romania and Serbia (and though not drawn, these do exist in Slovakia as well). These are extremely problematic to reintegrate into any kind of ""greater"" Hungary without taking large numbers of other ethnicities, and creating a diplomatic and geographic nightmare.

Fuck off: Non-Hungarian areas, or areas with Hungarian as a minority. Almost no one except some extreme nationalists even want these back. Relations between Hungarians and the red ethnicities are also strained (except Austria).

LOL: Croatia. This was part of Hungary through a personal union, but it was semi-independent, and not really considered part of the ""core"" kingdom.

In the DDR (East Germany 1949-90) only one party called *SED* (**S**ozialistische **E**inheitspartei **D**eutschlands/*Socialist Unity Party of Germany*) was allowed to rule. During the ""Revolution"" in December 1989 they changed their name to *PDS* (**P**artei des **D**emokratischen **S**ozialismus/Party of Democratic Socialism), because the name *SED* just stood for suppression and anything but Democracy, which was not the best position for them to be in for the first *free* elections in East-Germany that were set on 18 March 1990.

In 2005 the *PDS* then combined with the *WASG* (a group that protested against the policies of then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder) into the Party *Die Linke* (*the Left*).

Agreed on that.

&gt;Either we unify fiscal policies or we abandon the eurozone project with catastrophic consequences for all

The catastrophic consequences of your position can be seen today in Greece, Spain and Portugal. Fiscal integration doesn't bring back competitiveness, it widens the gap between rich and poor countries, increases unemployment AND debt. With no income and no growth, debt will not reduce itself.

&gt;The EU is attempting to unify fiscal policies

No it's not. The EP agreed to lower the budget (and therefore the transfers) for 2014-2020, not increase it. Germany did not agree to pay more for the other countries. As I've said before, I don't see this happening in the future.

Where does the buck stop? We can argue about specific instances where force made things worse (such as Iraq), but what's the alternative? The options are effectively ""use force to attempt to stop the problem"" or ""do nothing and hope the problem goes away."" 

&gt;The media just loves to make us feel disenfranchised from the world around us... Nobody considers the possibility that they might be the ones that will have to enforce that ""order"" or that the ""order"" will be enforced on them, so they cynically agree to supporting their neighbors' death or subjugation. If ""order"" is maintained through force instead of solidarity then maybe we need to change that, rather than defend it

I've got no idea what your point is here. It's not some sort of media conspiracy that makes people willing to accept force, it's part of being in a society. As a society, people have agreed to give certain powers to the government which they themselves are not allowed to exercise. 

&gt; You describe this so casually and find nothing wrong with it? You value this as a civilized society that opposition to the status quo is met with violence? Or that violence by the police is legal? In Iceland it isn't and people are doing fine, but nobody's telling you that, do they?

See, that comment about Iceland proves my point. The *threat* of violence is omnipresent. If you break a law, you've got two options; let the cops arrest you, or resist arrest. If you resist you know that they *will* use force. Maybe they'll just lead off with clubs and tazers instead of guns, but that's still force (and if you manage to overcome the clubs, you know that the cops are going to return with even more force, whether that means guns or just more officers). If the police weren't able to use force, there would never be any reason for you to *not* resist arrest. 

Now, pay close attention because I'm not supporting police brutality or anything like that. Police do not have a blank check to attack citizens without cause. But the simple fact is that power stems from the barrel of a gun. It's an authority that society *empowers* the government with.

I'm not a chauvinist, so I never understood what's wrong with that. 

&gt;""Russified Finn-Ugrians"" would probably be a fitting term for the Karelians, Ingrians etc. of these days.

They mostly refer to [Vepsians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vepsians) and [Chud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chud) because of the [Primary Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Chronicle) passage: 

&gt;They drove the Varangians back beyond the sea, refused to pay them further tribute, and set out to govern themselves. But there was no law among them, and tribe rose against tribe. Discord thus ensued among them, and they began to war one against the other. They said to themselves, ""Let us seek a prince who may rule over us, and judge us according to custom [po nravu]"". Thus they went overseas to the Varangians, to the Rus. These particular Varangians were known as Rus', just as some are called Swedes, and others Normans and Angles, and still others Gotlanders, for they were thus named. The Chuds, the Slavs, the Krivichians and the Ves then said to the Rus, ""Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come reign as princes, rule over us"".

&gt;Do you have any source for this? Would be interesting to read.

Well I don't agree myself with that point of view. Mostly because culturally and linguistically ethnic Russians are mostly Slavic. While genetically 25% of Russians, 65% of Finns and around 35% share [haplogroup N1c](http://www.eupedia.com/europe/Haplogroup_N1c_Y-DNA.shtml) this indicates that at least partially that hypothesis is correct.

While the original source of the hypothesis is surely [Mykhailo Hrushevskyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykhailo_Hrushevskyi) with his book Історія України-Руси.

Germany had imperialism and had to be stopped, but Vietnam, Pakistan, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, etc were attacked using rhetoric of defending democracy. In fact, with your logic, since US and Europe have been responsible for most of Africa's and the Middle East's destruction since after WW2, maybe we should start committing mass suicides?

Usually it is social pressure and learning that inhibits the criminal side in most people regardless of their rank. That's why consistently good diplomacy and acting in a way that promotes trust is important. 

Not all international crises can be solved without war, but those that require warfare are usually preceded by bad or lacking diplomacy and education. 

I find the belief that impeding corporal punishment is the only thing that inhibits criminal behavoir strange. Ask yourself: Why don't I steal? Or murder? Is it because I would go to jail (or worse) because of that? Or because I don't think murdering and stealing are morally acceptable?

You can't prove that. Even if you could, it's irrelevant because the question isn't ""should force always be used?"" it's ""should force sometimes be used?"". Since you bring up WW2, that's a pretty good example that sometimes force is needed. 

&gt; Don't just skim through links, actually read them. Iceland's police aren't allowed to use violence, unless first agreed by the community

Police in all democratic countries get the authority from the community to use force. They don't typically have to ask permission each and every time they use force, but it is still approved of. If the community *didn't* want police to be able to use force, they'd vote to change it.

&gt; The government is nothing abstract. It's a group of people. If people are so damn bad that we need the threat of force to maintain order, then they are also too bad to be in positions with the authority to enforce order.  

I don't follow this argument. Bad people definitely exist, and bad people can definitely be in charge of governments, so it seems that you're kind of floundering here. 

More importantly though, I'm not saying that all people are always bad all the time and only respond to a constant use of actual force. I'm saying that the threat of force exists everywhere. It might not be the primary response from the government (after all, most of the population doesn't commit crimes at all, and of those that do, most don't try to violently resist arrest), but threat is always somewhere down the pipe. If you break the laws and then defy law enforcement for long enough, it's a known fact that sooner or later you will be dealt with using some level of force.

false,HappyReaper,null,null,"&gt; You can be intelligent and still do stupid things. You can be really good at one thing and be absolutely clueless when dealing with another thing.

Which is exactly what I'm saying. They haven't protected themselves because they are not technologically savvy enough to be aware of the risks. They didn't do anything stupid, because with the knowledge-base they had (a fairly common one out of technologically-oriented circles), the risks weren't visible and couldn't be taken into consideration. An experienced chemist could theoretically detect that a medicine is dangerous, or know in which aspects state controls are weak and pay special attention to those products; that wouldn't make another victim of that medicine stupid (nor their decision) for not taking that into consideration.

&gt; You can secure your valuables and your person fairly easily and in a way that most people will intuitively understand. Even if you don't, you know that society will be able to deter and punish any would-be murderers and thieves from doing so. When you're discussing information it's not nearly as clear, especially in this day and age. 

And if you secured valuables in your person and you were mugged, would that make your decision stupid because in retrospect you could have secured them elsewhere?

You know the dangers of technology because, due to your life circumstances, your knowledge in that area happens to cover it; this isn't true for the majority of the population. It was perfectly reasonable for them to assume that the technology was secure, just as it is for you to assume that the food you buy won't poison you. In their case, their assumption happened to be false, and society failed to protect them from the crime committed against them.

&gt; For starters, who do we punish? The people who accessed the data illegally? (And how do you prove that?) Or maybe the people circulating these images, who probably number into the tens of millions by now? Are we going to have to draft up new laws requiring consent to view intimate photos? Is that even a good idea? — And so on. 

This is a totally separate discussion, but OK:

Yes, you punish the people who accessed that data illegally. When possible, you prove that with police-work; sometimes it isn't possible, just like what happens with other crimes, which doesn't somehow switch responsibility elsewhere. I believe it's also fair to punish the people who host those images publicly (if they are aware of it), or who store them privately (which is what is often done with other material obtained through abuse); the first case is usually easy to track, while the second is usually found by accident.

It's not fuzzy at all. An illegality being difficult to prove doesn't make it any less illegal. Accessing or hosting private information without consent is a crime in most countries; even just its possession is, in some cases.

&gt; What exactly is ""their"" sphere of knowledge exactly? Knowing how to look good and pose for the cameras? Are you implying that they should be expected to know nothing else?

I don't know them. If you want that question answered maybe you should ask them yourself. Everyone has a different sphere of knowledge, and technology is not everyone's. This is irrelevant for the discussion.

&gt; Again, that doesn't meant that the way in which they used it wasn't stupid. They shouldn't have been taking naked pictures of themselves in the first place.

They absolutely have the right to do so, and expect their privacy to be preserved. They weren't breaking any law or breaching anyone's rights. It's like when you are raped and someone tells you ""you shouldn't have been wearing those clothes in the first place"".

&gt; No, I'm just stating a fact. The only reason anyone cares at all is because they're young, attractive women whose role in society is to be sexually objectified. If they weren't, there wouldn't be hordes of men drooling over pictures of their naked bodies, and there wouldn't be anything to make a fuss over. In theory, I would also be writing the same exact lines if it happened to men, but if that were the case, nobody would be talking about it in the first place.

That is not a fact, and I'm actually proving you wrong by telling you that I couldn't care less about their gender. You are in fact the first person I've talked about this topic with who highlights their gender as a relevant factor. However, the hypothesis that other people may have inconsistent beliefs about this issue doesn't affect the validity of any reasons given here.

&gt; I'm not saying that they are responsible for what happened, I'm saying they should be more responsible about their own data.

Which, now that they have been victims of a crime, is a factor they can take into account for future decisions. It doesn't make their previous uninformed decision ""dumb"".",0,1412272571,null,0,false,0,ckyl3k5,t3_2i2ui8,t1_ckyl3k5,t1_ckyivih,null,1426716758,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I work in Alabama and in a city that is actually among the highest concentration of Masters level educated workers in the nation. 

And most people down here honestly don't care what you do. Have several friends that grew up gay in a very conservative small ""redneck"" town and nobody cared. Of course, he mostly keeps to himself and doesn't push an agenda. People down here react negatively when you push an agenda and in turn push their buttons. 

That's why the Top Gear episode went like it did. It was salacious and is not honestly a good representative of how people are down here. There are some that care but most don't. 

And if someone in the US is talking to someone that identifies themselves as being European and makes it obvious they're European that will of course incite conversation. Europeans down here are something you may come across once in your lifetime unless you go to an international city or a city they visit a lot (New Orleans... Europeans have been all over the place every time I've gone to NOLA). 

So I don't see why it's a negative why, if someone from Ardmore Alabama comes across a Dutch guy and wants to talk to him. He's being friendly. 

And your inclusion of ""Straight white male college students with no topic of religion"" kinda rubs me the wrong way. I happen to know a gay black atheist down here and he's gotten negative comments maybe once in his life. He's also a drag queen. In Alabama.

Stop thinking random news stories represent the US and it looks like you're trying to discredit your friends, who had what looks to be a good experience in the US, based on their ""demographic"".

Also a few centuries is still a lot of time to fuck up, german energy companies have repedeately proven they are utterly incompetent when it comes to waste, sometimes just throwing the waste containers into the storage place which led to damage to like 70% of them which are then leaking into the ground water, germans think that human error especially over a long time period will cause loads of trouble.

Germany is not actually burning more coal, they are exporting less energy and using more of it for energy at home, the new coal power plants are there to replace old ones, these will be more enviromental friendly, and while I aggree that we should get rid of coal, germany is still one of the leading european (and iirc. even world wide) countries for reaching the kyoto protocol numbers...

So we are overall doing pretty good.

Also if you planned to bring the whole germany has to buy energy from france thing later... let me just stop you here, infact that happens during winter yes!

But during summer france has to take a huge number of their nuclear power plants off the grid, otherwise they would overheat the lakes and rivers and would kill a lof of animals etc. (can also result in river water becoming extremely poisonious because of the fauna changes etc), so during summer they actually import energy from germany.

Why do you think people in the US South would give a shit what you are? 

I have lived in the US South almost my entire life and I find people's interpretation of the South completely false. There are parts where some of it is true but for the most part the US South is very diverse and people have been living with this diversity since Civil Rights back in the '60s without, for the most part, much issue. 

For instance, as of 2010, Metro Atlanta alone had Metro 716,434 foreign-born residents. That's a metro size of ~6.2mil so around 12%. 

As long as you're just visiting and don't try to push an agenda on anyone, they won't care. Because people down here don't even like their own siblings to push an agenda on them. As the saying goes down here:

* You can talk about anything in the South so long as it isn't politics or religion. 

To give you an idea, I had a tour of a plantation in the South and there was an Indian family also touring it. If I see someone is *obviously* not from the local area (even within the US) I'll usually be friendly and talk to them. This was in Louisiana. They had been through the South for almost a week at that point and had been having a wonderful time.

The measures taken are simply to require a higher level of education and income before accepting new immigrants.

&gt;What do we do after to save our economy ? 

Get out of the eurozone. Do you even understand what you read in this thread ?

Immigration costs 0,5% of GDP growth, euro costs at least 1%.

Other measures are detailed [here](http://www.frontnational.com/le-projet-de-marine-le-pen/).

&gt;Our society ? How do we deal with what we already have ? What is your vision of the future ? Do you really think getting rid of the Europe will bring us somewhere ?

&gt; * Don't spam.

&gt; * Don't ask for votes or engage in vote manipulation.

&gt; * Don't post personal information.

&gt; * No child pornography or sexually suggestive content featuring minors.

&gt; * Don't break the site or do anything that interferes with normal use of the site.

Si tu enfreins une de ces règles tu es susceptible de te faire shadowbanned par les admins. Lorsque tu es shadowbanned tu peux continuer à utiliser reddit comme d'habitude sauf que personne ne peut voir tes messages (à part toi et les modérateurs sur leur subreddit). Ça fonctionne de cette manière afin que les bots qui spamment ne se rendent pas compte qu'ils ont été banned (et qu'ils ne créent donc pas de nouveau comptes à cet effet).

A ne pas confondre avec le ban d'un subreddit qui t’empêche effectivement d’accéder au subreddit en question. Les modérateurs d'un subreddit ont toute liberté de bannir un utilisateur selon leurs propres règles.

Dans le cas présent il semble que /u/Warven a été shadowbanned puisque son message était visible seulement par les modérateurs. J'ai la possibilité d'approuver son commentaire manuellement, c'est pourquoi tu peux le lire.

Uno dei motivi è perché il sistema dei prezzi si è inceppato. Mi spiego: un sistema a cambi fissi può efficacemente funzionare se gli squilibri vengono corretti dal sistema dei prezzi, ossia quando i prezzi nella nazione in surplus, secondo la legge della domanda e dell'offerta, crescono, mentre diminuiscono quelli delle nazioni in deficit. Bene, nell'Eurozona è successo l'esatto contrario.

[fonte: FMI](http://i.imgur.com/RxWcjxr.png)

Nota come i Paesi in crisi sono quelli in cui i prezzi dei beni sono cresciuti più rapidamente. La crescita dei prezzi tedesca è sempre stata costantemente sotto il parametro di riferimento fissato dalla BCE, quindi significa che in termini reali la Germania ha svalutato rispetto a tutti gli altri Paesi dell'Eurozona. Capisci che stiamo parlando di leggi del mercato, quindi qualcosa deve aver pesantemente interferito: in questo caso, una parte della colpa può essere ricondotta al credito facile concesso dai Paesi del Nord a quelli del Sud (o quelli in crisi, definiscili come vuoi), che ha alimentato l'inflazione di questi ultimi (come dice, tra gli altri, pure Zingales, che mi pare non sia un pericoloso komunista keynesiano); l'altra parte della colpa può essere ricondotta alle riforme Hartz, con cui si sono precarizzati milioni di tedeschi, che ha causato una diminuzione dei salari pro capite del 6% tra il 2003 e il 2009, influenzando naturalmente il mercato interno e la dinamica dei prezzi (come ammette lo stesso governo tedesco).

I can. Isn't it sad that i can prove that ALL US and Europe interventions everywhere since after WW2 have made things worse? This is where the thought process ""let's intervene with force"" leads us
&gt;Even if you could, it's irrelevant because the question isn't ""should force always be used?"" it's ""should force sometimes be used?"". Since you bring up WW2, that's a pretty good example that sometimes force is needed.

Yes, and i agree with this, and i already admitted fault in generalizing. I've made my point though - a military-industrial complex lies about protecting democracy to support oil interests and they want us to think like the poll results.
&gt;If the community didn't want police to be able to use force, they'd vote to change it.
