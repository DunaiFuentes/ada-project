true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"There's some room for interpretation of the Lisbon Treaty in regards to by whom the President of the Commission is *nominated*. This is the first election under the new treaty, so there's no precedent, which pretty much means that however it will be done this year will become the way ""how it's always been done"".  
Under the old treaty, the various member states stuck their heads of government together to decide on a President of the Commission, and then the Parliament confirmed it. So, the Council nominated the President, and the Parliament's role was pretty much ceremonial. Under the new treaty, the Council is supposed to take the parliamentary election into account, which the Parliament interprets to mean that the Council's role is now purely ceremonial and the actual choice is up to the Parliament, if not formally then at least in practice. In theory, it has the power to do so by simply refusing to elect candidates until the Council gives in and nominates the ""right"" one, but if it came to that the Parliament better be able to draw legitimacy from a high turnout.

It seems odd that the treaty doesn't spell out how it's supposed to be done, but this isn't unusual. I'd bet that most Germans don't know that the Chancellor gets nominated in a similar manner -- *formally*, the Federal President nominates the Chancellor, to be elected by the Bundestag, there's just a very strong expectation that it will be whoever gets selected by a majority coalition. In the UK, *formally* the Queen just picks somebody AFAIK, but it would probably be the end of the monarchy if it wasn't the leading candidate of the party or coalition that won the parliamentary election. The European Parliament interprets the Treaty of Lisbon in a similar way, but this would mean a considerable shift of power away from the Council (read: national governments) towards the Parliament, so some people like to interpret the treaty differently.

They get these homophobe ideas/support from their religious faith. And when muslim jihadists destroy buildings and lives, they do so under the promise of a holy afterlife.

I know that some muslims are relatively civil, but that happens most often because of the secular/other faith people around them forcing them to assume a more western way of living their lives. Iran is an odd country all around and I won't go into discussing them.

The ultimate goal should be to make everyone more secular. But in the immediate future DO NOT piss against the wall and tell the non-believer it's raining.

It is not the only source of immoral violence and persecution in all of its kinds, but it is most certainly one of the most common.

true,mick_jones,null,null,"&gt; Non era pro­ba­bil­mente mai acca­duto prima che una sce­neg­gia­tura non pro­dotta otte­nesse un grado di noto­rietà simile a quella di Quen­tin Taran­tino per Hate­ful Eight. Per rica­pi­to­lare: l’anno scorso Taran­tino annun­cia di essere al lavoro su un nuovo film. Anche que­sto, come Django Unchai­ned, che gli è valso l’Oscar per la sce­neg­gia­tura, sarà un western, ambien­tato dopo la fine della guerra civile. A gen­naio il blog Defa­mer, una spe­cie di Dago­spia di Hol­ly­wood, ottiene e pub­blica una copia della sce­neg­gia­tura.
Taran­tino monta su tutte le furie annun­ciando una que­rela e accu­sando gli agenti degli attori a cui aveva pre­li­mi­nar­mente pre­stato il copione (fra gli altri Bruce Dern, Samuel Jack­son e Tim Roth) di avere inde­bi­ta­mente pas­sato lo script ai blog­ger. In que­ste con­di­zioni, afferma, non farà più il film e tanto peg­gio per tutti.
Due set­ti­mane fa Film Inde­pen­dent la fon­da­zione che spon­so­rizza il festi­val di Los Ange­les e gli Inde­pen­dent Spi­rit Awards annun­cia però che in via ecce­zio­nale il regi­sta con­durrà un «live read» — una let­tura dal vivo — degli Odiosi Otto desti­nato a vivere così, per una sola sera, in forma di «let­tura dram­ma­tica» di un gruppo di attori diretti dallo stesso Taran­tino. Un «read» con­si­ste, appunto, nella reci­ta­zione pub­blica e inte­grale di un copione da parte di un cast, simile a quelli con­dotti nelle prove prima delle riprese di un film. Il for­mato è diven­tato molto popo­lare in città gra­zie alla serie di «reads» pre­sen­tati al museo LACMA con la super­vi­sione di Jason Reit­man (Juno, Labor Day) .
Il pro­gramma di quest’anno si è con­cluso pro­prio gio­vedì scorso con la let­tura de Il Lau­reato a cui ha par­te­ci­pato Sha­ron Stone nei panni di Mrs. Robin­son, e alla pre­senza di Buck Henry lo sce­neg­gia­tore ori­gi­nale del film.
Il «read» a sor­presa annun­ciato da Taran­tino non ha invece pre­ce­denti in quanto basato su un mate­riale desti­nato a non essere mai pro­dotto altrove, il che spiega il tutto esau­rito fatto in pochi minuti quando sono stati messi in ven­dita i 1600 biglietti del Uni­ted Artist Thea­ter di Los Ange­les.
Fuori dal vec­chio movie palace, da poco restau­rato, sabato alle otto c’era una ressa delle grandi ante­prime; cine­fili, addetti ai lavori e taran­ti­ni­sti incal­liti hanno fatto dili­gen­te­mente la fila depo­si­tando i cel­lu­lari rigo­ro­sa­mente proi­biti come con­di­zione per l’occasione unica di ascol­tare la sce­neg­gia­tura «male­detta».
Poco dopo la folla è esplosa in applauso quando Taran­tino è salito su palco in tenuta western da «man in black», com­preso ste­tson nero sven­to­lato a mo’ di rodeo. Dall’introduzione e diven­tato subito chiaro che la sua rinun­cia al film è stata meno che peren­to­ria : «Fra poco ascol­te­rete la prima ste­sura di Hate­ful Eight — ha annun­ciato il regi­sta — sono al lavoro alla seconda e sicu­ra­mente ne seguirà poi una terza…». In altre parole un pro­gramma piut­to­sto chiaro di pre pro­du­zione di un film che pre­vede di fare. Poi, accolto da un tifo da sta­dio, il regi­sta ha pre­sen­tato il cast della serata come i «Taran­tino Super­stars», tutti col­la­bo­ra­tori di lungo corso: Kurt Rus­sell, Samuel L. Jac­skon, Amber Tam­blyn, Wal­ton Gog­gins, Tim­Roth, Michael Mad­sen, Zoe Bell e Bruce Dern.
Gli attori hanno preso posto sulle sedie dispo­ste sul pal­co­sce­nico scarno e Taran­tino si è messo die­tro il leg­gio posi­zio­nato sulla destra, ed ha comin­ciato a rac­con­tare il suo film. «Esterno giorno. Una pia­nura inne­vata del Wyo­ming ripresa in tutta la glo­ria dei 70 mil­li­me­tri… In lon­ta­nanza scor­giamo una dili­genza che attra­versa il pano­rama moz­za­fiato a tutta velo­cità…».
Taran­tino, si sa, sa essere con grande agio un gran «racon­teur» e, con con­sueta ani­ma­zione, ha descritto come la «stage coach» con­te­nesse due pas­seg­geri, legati ai polsi con un paio di manette : il cac­cia­tore di taglie John Ruth (Rus­sell) e la sua pri­gio­niera Daisy Domer­gue (Tam­blyn), un’ assas­sina che Ruth sta por­tando al pati­bolo nella città di Red Rock (a fronte di una lauta taglia). Ben pre­sto si imbat­tono in un uomo nero che fuma la pipa in mezzo alla pista seduto su tre cada­veri. È il mag­giore Mar­quis War­ren (Jack­son) della caval­le­ria nor­di­sta (di cui indossa ancora l’uniforme)passato anch’egli dopo la guerra all’attività di «bounty hun­ter» free­lance.
War­ren è un a vec­chia cono­scenza di Ruth e, cari­cato il suo cargo sulla dili­genza, il mag­giore si uni­sce alla comi­tiva. Poco più tardi ecco un nuovo incon­tro con un uomo dal forte accento sudi­sta, anche lui vit­tima di un inci­dente di cavallo ed appie­dato in mezzo alla pra­te­ria con­ge­lata. È Chris Man­nix (Wal­ton Gog­gins) un ribelle irre­go­lare del Mis­souri, noto per le scor­ri­bande a fianco dei con­fe­de­rati e le vio­lente rap­pre­sa­glie conto i neri eman­ci­pati. Fra lui e il mag­giore War­ren ci sono subito scin­tille di osti­lità ideo­lo­gica e raz­ziale. Il gruppo per ripa­rarsi da una ter­ri­bile bufera di neve, rag­giunge la sta­zione di posta detta Millie’s Haber­da­shery, tenuta da un impro­ba­bile oste fran­cese. Il resto del «film» si svolge per­lo­più in quest’unica loca­tion dove i nostri si uni­scono a un boia (Tim Roth), un anziano gene­rale con­fe­de­rato (Dern) e un taci­turno cow­boy (Mad­sen). Le dina­mi­che nel gruppo sono scan­dite dal solito dia­logo a raf­fica che rivela ine­so­ra­bil­mente con­flitti far i per­so­naggi e alza ver­ti­gi­no­sa­mente il livello di peri­colo.
Vista l’ambientazione, la pro­fes­sione e razza dei due pro­ta­go­ni­sti­prin­ci­pali, i paral­leli con Django diven­tano chia­ra­mente ine­vi­ta­bili, anche per­ché Taran­tino torna con que­sto testo a ela­bo­rare in chiave «post­mo­derna» il retag­gio di schia­vi­smo e seces­sione. Ma il tono della trama che carica la ten­sione in un ambiente con­fi­nato porta alla mente anche certi pas­saggi di Death Proof, e la scena della taverna di Bastardi Senza Glo­ria.
Dato che la parola è il fon­da­mento dell’artificio taran­ti­niano, Odiosi è un western «dia­let­tico», e il dia­logo è con­sue­ta­mente infar­cito di sofi­smi e tur­pi­lo­quio quanto l’azione lo è di bru­ta­lità. Da quello che abbiamo visto sul palco del Uni­ted Artists, le pole­mi­che ancora una volta divam­pate dopo Django — in par­ti­co­lare sull’uso di epi­teti raz­zi­sti — non hanno mini­ma­mente ini­bito la riven­di­ca­zione del regi­sta al loro uso come legit­tima espres­sione arti­stica. Regi­sta e per­so­nag­gio, da die­tro al suo leg­gio, Taran­tino ha descritto scene e inqua­dra­ture, simu­lato effetti sonori, snoc­cio­lato rife­ri­menti e cita­zioni di clas­sici del genere e a volte ammic­cando diret­ta­mente al pub­blico senza lasciar ombra di dub­bio su chi fosse in com­pleto con­trollo del mate­riale e della serata. «Eh no, eh!» — ha escla­mato a un certo punto rivolto ai suoi attori — evi­tiamo di co-sceneggiare. Atte­ne­tevi al testo per favore». Uno scor­cio impa­ga­bile sul pro­cesso crea­tivo e sul metodo di uno dei regi­sti più cari­sma­tici oggi attivi.

true,itstugi,null,null,"&gt; But most people don't work in the financial sector.

I agree. Most people don't, but an unproportional amount do, given its gross productivity. According to [this](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa1-rd/united-kingdom-national-accounts/2006-edition/united-kingdom-national-accounts---the-blue-book.pdf), and depending on your definition (including real estate) of financial sector, the revenues of that were up to ~16% of the UK's GDP in 2004 (page 110). Now it's under 10%, if I remember correctly.

Anyway, with such a large chunk dependent on the wellbeing of the financial sector, other lines of work are obviously influenced by it, as demand will decrease for the other industries.

&gt; I think we just have the same problems in every country, the recession gives them the opportunity to ask for lower wages due to higher unemployment and a reticence to risk switching jobs. 

Yes and no. Our wages, like in the US, have not increased in real terms since the mid 90's. This is also due to the fact that they were too high to begin with, but now this trend is continuing despite a favourable economic climate. Yes, employers have it easier to make people work for less, and there, the government needs to step in. However(!) there are other contributing factors for the apparent decrease of wealth, which are the rising energy costs with the EEG-Umlage (I'm not going to translate this :D) and the further gentrification and the steep price increase in rent, essentially making landlords 19th century capitalists with little to no oversight.

&gt; Alongside the ever increasing automation of tasks and offshoring of more work.

I disagree. This has been going on for 200 years, and we're doing better than ever. Actually, I think this is not a problem for us, but for the poorer countries, as we are basically living off their poverty.

&gt; Honestly, I can just see us ending up more like developing countries, with terrible inequality, divisive politics, rampant crime, etc.

I don't think so. The inequality is stark, and maybe on the rise, but we are nowhere near developing countries' levels (check out the lowest 15% of the U.S. in OP's link!).

There will be no trend to divisive politics. Germans *hate* divisive politics and polarising statements. That's why Angela Merkel is chancellor. And why she has to deal with the SPD as junior partner. The FDP was too direct and had absolute opinions, which has been a no-no in German politics since the 80's. With Merkel, we're just floating along, getting the feel-good politics and rhetoric that the German public loves.

Crime is actually not a major problem I think, yeah, we're not on Icelandic levels, but hey, we're a big country, there are always people trying to cheat the system.",0,1398254482,null,0,false,0,cgztstm,t3_23oifj,t1_cgztstm,t1_cgzr70w,null,1433482804,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

Il fatto che l'iniziativa sia esplicitamente *vietata* agli uomini, mi fa pensare che sia una sorta di risposta alle attività *vietate* alle donne, cosa non vera.

Ma permettimi di auto-denunciarmi dicendo che io sono uno di quelli che aborra le ""quote rosa"" come quelle presenti in politica, per il semplice fatto che la mia idea è che a me interessa avere dei buoni politici, non ha alcuna importanza per me che siano uomini o donne. ""Allora come risolvi il fatto che ci siano solo politici uomini?"" mi chiederai tu. E io ti risponderò ""Non lo so, in un mondo perfetto il motivo potrebbe essere che alle donne non interessa entrare in politica, in questo mondo probabilmente ci saranno una marea di altri fattori, ma di sicuro non è dovuto a delle ""quote blu"" o che dir si voglia"". Già che siamo in argomento, qualcuno mi spiega come mai non ci sono le ""quote rosa"" tra i piloti di F1? Perché nella F1 la bravura di un pilota è immediatamente misurabile (al millesimo di secondo) e quantificabile. E i pochi piloti donna che si sono presentati nel corso degli anni, erano per lo più mediocri. Vogliamo politici mediocri perché abbiamo le quote rosa e quindi ce li dobbiamo tenere? Vogliamo delle specialiste informatiche mediocri perché agli uomini vengono vietate queste iniziative? Non voglio dire che le donne sono mediocri, attenzione. Le donne hanno lo stesso potenziale degli uomini, aspetto con gioia una Schumacher femmina, sarebbe bello poterla vedere in questa vita. Ma finora, fatti alla mano, non è ancora successo.

Non so, non detengo la verità, magari mi sbaglio di brutto, ma cosi a pelle quest'iniziativa mi sembra quasi come voler ridurre gli incidenti stradali legando dei cuscini sui paraurti, quando con'adeguata educazione stradale e una corretta imposizione delle regole stradali si otterrebbero risultati migliori.

In reality I would argue that a large fraction of Russians have always been at least acquiescent if not downright enthusiastically supportive of their government's policies. For instance, I definitely believe that Putin's astronomically high approval rating is quite real and reflective of the true sentiments of the general Russian population.

Moreover, frankly whatever view Russians may have about Russia's internal policies, when it comes to foreign affairs, there has always been a much higher degree of consensus [uniting the government and the general population](http://sovmusic.ru/jpg/posters/ussr0067.jpg). If anything, the arts are just as emblematic of this attitude. For instance, no matter how critical Solzhenitsyn might have been of the Soviet government, when it came to Russian nationalism he was more than fully on board. The sciences are really not that different either. I'm a physicist and the subject of politics has inevitably repeatedly cropped up when talking to Russian colleagues. And frankly in contrast to the more moderate attitude I would have expected to come with education, anecdotally even among them notions of Russia being the ""elder nation"" showing the light to the surrounding peoples is surprisingly prevalent.

true,RealSourLemonade,WALE,Cymru,"&gt;The Obama administration has expressed concern at what US officials see as Britain's slide towards the European exit door.
Washington firmly believes that the departure of its strongest partner in Europe would also reduce American influence on the continent, as Britain so often shares American views.
""It is important to state very clearly that a strong UK in a strong Europe is in America's national interest,"" said a senior US administration official. ""We recognise national states but see the EU as a force multiplier.""
Britain's free trade philosophy is regarded as vital in preventing the union from drifting towards protectionism, while since World War Two, successive British governments have been more assertive on a variety of foreign policy issues, and more in line with American thinking, than other major European nations.
""We understand that a Europe without the UK would be a weaker Europe,"" said a Whitehall source.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt; Georgian war proved that Russian army is a joke - they met next to no resistance yet still struggled very much to have everything done.

And they still managed to capture all of their objectives in three days. I think as time passes, it looks more and more likely that the operations in Georgia were little more than a dry run of subsequent invasions. Sure Russia struggled in Georgia, but they also learned a good deal about their capabilities and tactics at the time.

This article could be less effective without the context of Snowden.

This is all speculation of course, but it could be one possible explanation of the ""indignation"" witnessed in this article.

&gt;

&gt;The __Convention on Road Signs and Signals__, commonly known as the __Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals__, is a [multilateral treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateral_treaty) designed to increase road safety and aid international road traffic by standardising the signing system for road traffic ([road signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs), [traffic lights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_lights) and [road markings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_marking)) in use internationally.

&gt;This convention was agreed upon by the [United Nations Economic and Social Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Council) at its Conference on Road Traffic in [Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna) 7 October 1968 to 8 November 1968, was done in Vienna on 8 November 1968 and [came into force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_into_force) 6 June 1978. This conference also produced the [Vienna Convention on Road Traffic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_Road_Traffic), which complements this legislation by standardising international [traffic laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_laws).

&gt;The convention revised and substantially extended the earlier 1949 Geneva Protocol on Road Signs and Signals,  itself based in turn on the 1931 Geneva Convention concerning the Unification of Road Signals.

Tu n'es pas à une contradiction près, je vais pas faire de multicross-quotes mais tu dis plus haut que le doxxing te foutrait ta carrière en l'air. 

Le FN ne sera jamais dédiabolisé dans le jeu des partis, c'est un doux mythe qui, répété 1000 fois, n'en sera pas plus vrai.

&gt;Ou sinon défendre des idées, dissolution de l'euro et réduction de l'immigration par exemple.

Il faudrait que tu m'expliques en quoi ces idées sont spécifiques au FN, pourquoi elles sont de bonnes solutions aux problèmes actuels, comment le FN dont l'appareil de parti est squelettique compte les appliquer. Dans la bouche de Marine ou de Filippot, je n'entends que des cris, légitimes peut-être, contre le système et la recherche de boucs-émissaires ( tu viens d'en donner deux, on peut en ajouter d'autres comme tu sais, les juifs, la finance, les roms, les droits de l'homme, les homos, les parisiens, les canards, les chinois, les polonais, les fonctionnaires, les féministes, les républicains, les musulmans, les énarques, les journalistes, les partis, je me demande qui cela laisse dans la société française ). Être une marionnette de Guignol, c'est la raison d'être du FN, pas les ""idées"" ou le ""programme"" de la Marine. 

&gt;D'où vient ton obsession pour le caca ? Tu proposais déjà un régime à base de merde à un mod.

Quelle obsession ? Un type me ban, je vais pas lui envoyer des fleurs. D'autant qu'il n'a rien d'autre à foutre que de screener un MP pour faire de la dénonciation. Cela m'étonne à peine que tu justifies des techniques de délation et d'abus de pouvoir. Est-ce de ma faute si ""de merde"" est le qualificatif qui vient immédiatement pour les idées du FN ? Elles en ont le goût et l'odeur. 

&gt;Par ailleurs, le fait même qu'on ait eu une discussion tout à fait normale avec l'un de mes autres comptes montre bien que j'ai eu raison d'abandonner /u/BonConseil[1] [-22] . La fin de la forme mais la progression des idées.

Che il mio precedente PM, appena entrato in azienda, veniva a parlare inizialmente sempre con il mio collega (a parità di seniority). Era una cosa istintiva. Ho dovuto dimostrare di avere delle skills, cosa che non è stata un problema (le avevo), ma frustrante. Senza contare che, sempre in confronto al medesimo collega, ero più portata in alcuni task e mi venivano assegnati dopo che era lui a dichiarare che era più ""conveniente"" (in termini di velocità/modalità di esecuzione) darlo a me. (Non me la sto tirando, lui era più skillato in altri ambiti, ovviamente. Ognuno ha i suoi cavalli di battaglia.)



Possono sembrarti delle sciocchezze, ma è frustrante, pregiudizievole. Sono nuova di qui, quindi non so bene tu cosa fai, posso definirti un fumettista? Ma se qualcuno pensasse di te ""sì, okay, ha fatto delle cosine carine, però è (boh, metto a caso:) italiano."" (utilizzato come confronto verso altri fumettisti internazionali, termine tendenziamente irrilevante per la tua produzione, ma usato in quel contesto contro di te, come se fosse una caratteristica che definisce te e le tue capacità) non ti farebbe girare il culo?

Ein Gesetz von 1965, das jetzt fast 50 Jahre alt und damit näher am dritten Reich als an der Gegenwart ist, kann doch die Möglichkeiten des Internets, Streamings, P2P usw. überhaupt nicht einfangen. Aber politisch wird da natürlich an dem festgehalten, was schon immer so war. Der ganze christlichrechtskonservative Brei zielt doch nur darauf, dass alles bleibt, wie es ist. Darauf werden Zeit, Energie und Geld verschwendet, anstatt sich mal über vernünftige Lösungen Gedanken zu machen. Allein die NSA-Geschichte zeigt, dass unsere regierende Klasse überhaupt kein Verständnis für die ganze Thematik hat. 

Die Erfahrung zeigt, dass Serien, die im halblegalen Streaming gut laufen, auch mehr als DVD oder was auch immer gekauft werden. Bands verdienen ihr Geld seit Jahrzehnten nicht mehr mit Plattenverkaüfen, sondern mit Konzerten und Merch.

Überhaupt, warum soll ich darunter leiden, dass die gierigen Medien- und Wirtschaftssyndikate und die Regierung, die ihnen nach dem Mund redet, ihren Hals nicht voll genug kriegen können? Soll ich darauf verzichten, eine Serie zu sehen, die nur einen Klick entfernt ist? Klar, ich könnte auch ein halbes Jahr warten, bis die Serie mit beschissener deutscher Synchro und drei Werbepausen am Samstag vormittag bei den Privaten läuft, wenn ich sie ""umsonst"", also bezahlt mit meiner Zwangsabgabe sehen will.  

Nochmal zur Werbung. Bei dem ganzen Scheiß gehts doch nur darum, sich systematisch belügen, instrumentalisieren und unmündig machen zu lassen. Werbung in fast allen Formen ist für mich eine Belästigung. Die halten jeden für einen Trottel (was in den meisten Fällen ja auch korrekt ist), das ist eine Beleidigung. Im Supermarkt stehen vier Regale voll mit 5436 verschiedenen Schampoos, die im Wesentlichen alle das selbe tun. Ungefähr niemand braucht medizinische Pflegemittel. Gegen Schuppen, gegen Haarausfall, für mehr Dichte, Haarreparatur, nässende Kopfhaut bla bla bla. Wer braucht denn den ganzen Mist? Wer hat überhaupt Lust, sich damit auseinanderzusetzen? Länger als dreißig Sekunden bafasse ich mich doch nicht mit dem Quatsch. Selbes bei Stromanbietern oder Handyverträgen. Da wird einem vorgegaukelt, dass man sich als freier Konsument ja aufgeklärt über die verschiedenen Angebot informieren und dann nach seinen eigensten Bedürfnissen auswählen kann. Jeder Einkauf wird so zu einer Selbstverwirklichung. Blödsinn. Das ist alles der selbe Dreck, der halt nur anders stinkt. 

Und solange mir keiner nachweisen kann, dass Adblock krimineller ist als die Konzernoligarchie, von der wir regiert werden, bleibt mein Adblock an. Mein Mitleid mit den armen Werbetreibenden hält sich in Grenzen.

 [**Filter bubble**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter%20bubble): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;A __filter bubble__ is a result state in which a website [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on information about the user (such as location, past click behaviour and search history) and, as a result, users become separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles. Prime examples are [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google)'s personalised search results and [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook)'s personalised news stream. The term was [coined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism) by [internet activist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_activism) [Eli Pariser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Pariser) in his book by the same name; according to Pariser, users get less exposure to conflicting viewpoints and are isolated intellectually in their own informational bubble. Pariser related an example in which one user searched Google for ""BP"" and got investment news about [British Petroleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Petroleum) while another searcher got information about the [Deepwater Horizon oil spill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill) and that the two search results pages were ""strikingly different.""     The bubble effect may have negative implications for civic discourse, according to Pariser, but there are contrasting views suggesting the effect is minimal  and addressable.

This does nothing with regards to the discourse of xenophobes because they don't care about facts that much. 

As for those wanting tighter controls, this gives them plenty of arguments. Kids having rebelling against such backwards forms of parenting, shows they do bring these customs with them and try to hold on to their culture. It also points out there's probably many other kids being oppressed by their parents who don't dare to rebel. It does show these families have a high likelihood of ending up being dysfunctional and problematic. 

Also importing more and more of these cultures means it becomes easier for them to immerse themselves and their own children in their own tradition.

Toute la politique d'Amérique du Sud, l'article du sujet décrit bien la position du Monde : il passe sous silence le soutient populaire du gouvernement en place et raconte la repression des manifs étudiantes pacifistes, san trop parler du fait que ces étudiants mettent en avant les combats des anciens bourgeois en exil depuis que Chavez a nationalisé leurs entreprises pétrolières.

Les manifs à Taiwan, contre encore une fois le recul de l'Etat devant les marchés avec les privatisations habituelles, sont passées sous silence.

Questo è ovviamente valido per ogni settore.

This reduces inflation as wages decrease (cost of things goes down) which is necessary in the UK as the pound is already very strong. This is why richer countries like the UK and Germany require poorer countries in the EU (like my own) so that goods can be manufactured at a cheaper cost. It is also why they need a certain level of immigration by low skilled workers to put a downward pressure on inflation. Otherwise inflation would spiral out of control and the countries would be too expensive to live in which is what happened in Ireland.

However, people object to this as they see their wages decrease so their gut reaction is that it is negative. The truth is that with increased integration and a reasonable intake of immigration this deflation is perfectly ok and actually beneficial as these people pay taxes to support the social state (which helps the poor that are the main critics of immigration) which in turn facilitates and creates employment and thus limiting unhealthy deflation.

It has a lot of soft power, but it doesn't come close to matching American soft power. They say the one thing that the US managed to export best was its culture. Europe doesn't have a cohesive culture to export. In fact, it imports more American culture than vice versa.

The EU is an economic giant, I'll give it that, but its hard power is incredibly reliant on American power. France and Britain, far and away the most capable military powers in Europe, are heavily reliant on the US for logistical support, troop transport, intelligence etc.

Imagine if the USSR had been unable to move and support troops in Afghanistan without the help of the US. Would anyone have called it a superpower?

Europe has the potential to be a superpower at most on par with the US. It's rich, has a large population, advanced technology etc. The problem is that is politically fragmented for no good reason other than emotional arguments concerning sovereignty and national identity.

China, more than any other country, is in the best position to become a superpower in this century, and that is mostly due to the fact that it has nearly a billion and a half people.",0,1398269269,null,0,false,0,cgzzdrj,t3_23rbmd,t1_cgzzdrj,t3_23rbmd,null,1433485501,15,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,15

What I do think is that there has been a very worrying tendency in some European countries where bowing to people's religious beliefs is becoming the norm, out of political correctness. 

That habit was mostly long gone with regards to Christianity, the dominant religion. The law has been defined from a secular perspective, and religion has had to adapt. But the stance with regards to cultures other than our own in many cases has been different. Treating their religions as we have treated ours is deemed racist and xenophobic.

In the same vain of what you said, you can have the best training and the best weapons in the world, but it doesn't mean a damn thing if you can't get them where you need them to be or worse can't keep them supplied when they're there.

On the other hand the EU even though we were struck hard by the crisis has a larger combined gdp and population, still the potential for expansion (whether that's something we wish for is debatable though) and a higher potential for growth in it's east where the former soviet block is catching up. I'd say the potential is there to surpass considering we still got nearly 86 years to go. A lot could happen though. China could become a bubble that's about to burst even when their government keeps it in line so far (in a fair or unfair way). 

Take Germany for example. I turned from a ruined and beaten nation stripped of some land with a semi crushed infrastructure and a new government once more into the strongest economic nation in Europe in much less time. Hell that's about the time it took for the US to actually establish itself as a world power.

Sure times are not the same but looking back at history it's more then possible.

I agree that at the moment we're nowhere close due to being fragmented though.

As far as soft power goes it's debatable too. The EU spends more of it's budget on foreign aid. Also simply due to being split up a lot more is spend on our diplomatic infrastructure and relations are mostly good with former colonies like the UK's. On the other hand the EU is building up association agreements across the world. And has already established them with much of south-east asia, india, nearly entire south america, the middle east and north africa, canada and soon the US.

edit: Monocle's ranking seems to agree with me: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power#Measuring

Some other notes:

&gt;John McCormick believes that the EU has already achieved superpower status, based on the size and global reach of its economy and on its global political influence. He argues that the nature of power has changed since the Cold War-driven definition of superpower was developed, and that military power is no longer essential to great power; he argues that control of the means of production is more important than control of the means of destruction, and contrasts the threatening hard power of the United States with the opportunities offered by the soft power wielded by the European Union.

&gt;Alexander Stubb, the Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs, has said that he thinks the EU is both a superpower and not a superpower. While the EU is a superpower in the sense that it is the largest political union, single market and aid donor in the world, it is not a superpower in the defense or foreign policy spheres. Like Barry Buzan, Alexander Stubb thinks that the most major factor constraining the EU’s rise to superpower status is its lack of statehood in the international system, other factors are its lack of internal drive to project power worldwide, and continued preference for the sovereign nation-state amongst some Europeans. To counterbalance these, he urged the EU leaders to approve and ratify the Lisbon Treaty (which they did in 2009), create an EU foreign ministry (EEAS, established in 2010), develop a common EU defense, hold one collective seat at the UN Security Council and G8, and address what he described as the “sour mood” toward the EU prevalent in some European countries today.",0,1398271357,null,0,1398277234,0,ch00ddk,t3_23rbmd,t1_ch00ddk,t1_cgzzdrj,null,1433485967,20,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,20

true,emergency_poncho,EURO,European Union,"&gt;Moravcsik is a smart guy, but his argument that Europe is the world's second superpower is laughable.
It has a lot of soft power, but it doesn't come close to matching American soft power. They say the one thing that the US managed to export best was its culture. Europe doesn't have a cohesive culture to export. In fact, it imports more American culture than vice versa.

Are you stupid or something? You just blatantly contradict yourself in your first two sentences. No one is saying Europe can match America's hard or soft power - his argument is that Europe is a better candidate for the world's **2nd superpower** in the 21st century than either China or India.

&gt;The EU is an economic giant, I'll give it that, but its hard power is incredibly reliant on American power.

Moravcsik's whole point is that hard power, in the 21st century, is becoming less and less important, and soft power is increasingly important for states to get what they want. Statistically, interstate wars are much less common than they were in the 20th century (or in any other period in human history, for that matter), the cost of war is becoming prohibitively expensive, and public support for war is eroding quickly - even US populations are becoming war-weary. Hard power is less and less useful as a means for a state to get what it wants.

&gt;The problem is that is politically fragmented for no good reason other than emotional arguments concerning sovereignty and national identity.

True, but I wouldn't call issues like national identity and sovereignty, essentially the core of nation-states, merely trifling, unimportant issues that European countries are inexplicably hot-headed about. A country willingly abandoning its sovereignty runs directly contrary to everything any politician, philosopher, or historian has ever thought, in the entire history of humanity up until relatively recently.

&gt;China, more than any other country, is in the best position to become a superpower in this century, and that is mostly due to the fact that it has nearly a billion and a half people.

Moravcsik directly undermines this point, arguing that in the 21st century, a state's ability to project power can be best measured via GDP per capita - the wealth of a nation's citizens. China has 300 million middle-class and upper-class citizens, and about 1 billion people squandering in poverty.

The last city that the Halych brothers visited was Horlivka. According to Yevhen’s family, several unsuccessful attempts have been made to use his brother’s bank card.

&gt;  “The last call from Hennadiy came at 11:00 am with the information that they were in Horlivka and that there was unrest in the city. The code word that I knew was mentioned. He repeated that word three times and then suddenly hung up. At 11:40 I tried to phone my husband but the call was rejected. At 12:15 I received a text message stating ‘I am busy, will call.’ All subsequent attempts to contact him or his brother Yevhen have been unsuccessful,” she said.

I'm not sure about that. The US has had faster population and economic growth than the EU for a long time. [The IMF projects that the US will overtake the EU in GDP within a couple of years as well.](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2013/01/pdf/text.pdf)


I think soft power is something that is hard to quantify. It's also entirely dependent on time.

I won't argue that Germany doesn't have a great deal of soft power, but if we take the example of media, then how could any country even compete with American soft power?

The fact that we're typing in English here rather than in Flemish or French is indicative of American (and British) soft power in the long term.

From what I heard there also seem to be a lot of Poles grabbing the oppertunity to learn Dutch, so much infact that I heard the language courses are full of Poles while other ethnicities are more likely to bail. 

negative sides are that they are considered to be very cheap labour, with many (unlike the UK for example) that only work here temporarely and have a house with children in Poland or saving up money for it. This also means they live cheap in the Netherlands, want to work very long hours and are more eager to work under shitty conditions. And well that doesn't fit well with the people who's jobs they are competing with, is this fair competition? Other thing is the Drunk and the driving, in some area's there are already problems with youth drinking way too much but atleast we have had some campaigning creating social awareness about drunk driving the last decades, this sadly is still is missing a lot in the Poles atm (plenty of accidents caused by drunk poles in the region here) Theft in the cities has gone down, but theft on the once very safe rural area's has gone up and most of it is going east, so people blame the ex-ussr countries which Poland happens to be one of. Do remember crime has gone down in Poland, and we are probably receiving some of the folks who caused. We generally get low-educated poles here with more students in the summer.

Je suis calé sur les sujets que j'aborde. En toute humilité.

&gt;Pour ce qui est de l'extrémisme, la question est de savoir si une idée tente de briser le consensus 

Manque de chance ce n'est pas ça l'[extrémisme](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extr%C3%A9misme).

Et le consensus au sein de quel groupe ?

Si c'est briser le consensus de la minorité politio-médiatique qui opprime la majorité, alors oui, on peut dire cela des idées du FN.

Si tu parles du consensus de la population, alors ce n'est pas le cas, la majorité étant largement contre la poursuite de la politique d'immigration actuelle. D'ailleurs on reproche souvent au FN d'être démagogue.

&gt;les extrémismes sont donc malvenus pour ce qui est de faire de la politique.

Le lien logique sort de nulle part.

&gt; Et d'ailleurs, ils n'y crois pas eux-même : leur but avoué n'est pas d'accéder au pouvoir, mais de faire évoluer les idées.

Tu devrais relire [Gramsci](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci).

Il y a une bataille des idées pour faire qualifier des idées normales, et inversement faire passer des idées extrémistes dans l'opinion majoritaire.

Le but principal n'est pas d'accéder au pouvoir mais bien que la France améliore sa situation. En particulier, en appliquant les idées du FN. Il ne s'agit pas d'une démarche d'égos ou de personnes. On ne va pas trahir nos électeurs pour avoir un ministère comme l'ont fait EELV ou le PCF.

I think Madrid is more classical, and Barcelona more modern, but both cities very cosmopolites. I'm sure you'll feel like in home.

San Sebastián is reaaaaally beautiful. And Bilbao has the Guggenheim museum. Road to Bilbao, you can make a stop in Burgos and see the famous cathedral in a quick visit.

The south of Spain has good places to visit too, but maybe you'd need more time in Spain.

true,koleye,UNSA,American Europhile,"&gt;Are you stupid or something? You just blatantly contradict yourself in your first two sentences. No one is saying Europe can match America's hard or soft power - his argument is that Europe is a better candidate for the world's 2nd superpower in the 21st century than either China or India.

I'll admit I didn't watch the video, but I am very familiar with Moravcsik's writing. He has, in numerous articles, argued that Europe is currently the world's second superpower. [Take this article from March 2010 for example.](https://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/library/current_history.pdf)

In the introduction he states that
&gt;...Europe is clearly the second superpower in 
a bipolar world.

&gt;Moravcsik's whole point is that hard power, in the 21st century, is becoming less and less important, and soft power is increasingly important for states to get what they want. Statistically, interstate wars are much less common than they were in the 20th century (or in any other period in human history, for that matter), the cost of war is becoming prohibitively expensive, and public support for war is eroding quickly - even US populations are becoming war-weary. Hard power is less and less useful as a means for a state to get what it wants.

The great powers have refrained from war among themselves since WWII. That doesn't mean hard power isn't useful. The whole reason we call it the Cold War was because the US and USSR never came to blows. They leveraged both their soft and hard power in third countries. The US, Russia, and the EU ALL still do this. (Afghanistan, Mali, Libya, Syria, Ukraine etc). Public support for war waxes and wanes. The US was war weary after Vietnam, but became involved in numerous conflicts in the 1990s. The same will be true of this century.

&gt;True, but I wouldn't call issues like national identity and sovereignty, essentially the core of nation-states, merely trifling, unimportant issues that European countries are inexplicably hot-headed about. A country willingly abandoning its sovereignty runs directly contrary to everything any politician, philosopher, or historian has ever thought, in the entire history of humanity up until relatively recently.

In the grand scheme of things, they are entirely unimportant. A country is just a big tribe. There's literally zero logical reason for one species to be split into 200+ tribes that compete against each other in a zero-sum game. In suggesting more political unity, I don't hold Europe to a different metric than other regions of the world. It's just that Europe is closest to abandoning an old style of nationalism in favor of a new one based on things less close to one's heart than ethnicity, national identity, or religion.

&gt;Moravcsik directly undermines this point, arguing that in the 21st century, a state's ability to project power can be best measured via GDP per capita - the wealth of a nation's citizens. China has 300 million middle-class and upper-class citizens, and about 1 billion people squandering in poverty. What good are these masses of poor doing, other than sucking up state funds, and being able to topple the government if they become too angry?

The problem with that argument is that despite the billion people living in poverty, everyone is talking about how China is on the cusp of being a superpower.

Does anyone make the same arguments for other newly industrialized countries like South Africa or Indonesia? No, and the reason is because they don't have the manpower to power a massive economy.

The PRC hasn't been toppled because the economy is visibly improving for most people, even if they are still nominally poor.

If GDP per capita translated directly into power projection, then why can't Luxembourg, Singapore, and Belgium be superpowers?

At the end of the day, being a superpower is largely a function of both GDP per capita and population.

The US has a large population and a high GDP per capita.
China has a larger population with a lower GDP per capita.

Both are conducive to superpower status.",0,1398272936,null,0,false,0,ch014zn,t3_23rbmd,t1_ch014zn,t1_ch00gek,null,1433486328,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

And, having helped to knock out Libya's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes, it pulled back from the front-line operations. But America's role remains essential, not least in providing air-to-air refuelling, as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the European allies.

[Poland Requests U.S. Military Presence](http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/europe/item/8488-poland-requests-us-military-presence)

&gt;Poland’s recent appeal to Washington reads like something printed on the front pages of newspaper from 20 years ago: Poland Fears Russian Invasion – Asks U.S. for Soldiers.

&gt;Radek Sikorski, Poland’s foreign minister, made the request for an American military presence after becoming “alarmed” by Russia’s recent military exercises conducted in Belarus, a former Soviet satellite that borders Poland. Sikorski minced no words in his entreaty: “We would like to see US troops stationed in Poland to serve as a shield against Russian aggression. If you can afford it, we need some strategic reassurance.” The appeal comes about a month after Vice President Joe Biden proclaimed America’s determination to continue providing support to Poland. It seems Mr. Sikorski is ready to put Biden’s sincerity to the test.

&gt;The U.S. military is increasing its presence in Poland and the Baltics in response to the crisis in Ukraine, officials said Wednesday.

&gt;The military will deploy jets now in the Britian — six F-15 fighters and one KC-135 re-fueler — to Siauliai Air Base in Lithuania, a U.S. defense official told NBC News.

&gt;The U.S. already has four F-15s in Lithuania as part of a NATO’s Baltic air policing rotation — jets that fly patrols and respond to airspace violations in the Baltics.

[U.S. Navy ship to arrive in Black Sea by Thursday](http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/08/politics/us-navy-ship-ukraine/)

&gt;Washington (CNN) -- The Navy warship USS Donald Cook is scheduled to enter the Black Sea no later than Thursday as part of the latest U.S. military effort to demonstrate support for Eastern European allies concerned about Russia's troop buildup along its border with Ukraine.

&gt;The movement of the guided missile destroyer was confirmed to CNN by two U.S. military officials who declined to be identified because a formal announcement has not been made. The ship will conduct exercises and port visits while in the Black Sea. The guided missile destroyer USS Truxtun took part in scheduled exercises in the Black Sea last month and departed March 21.

&gt;NATO members Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey have Black Sea coastlines, as do non-members Ukraine, Russia and Georgia.

Europe has some of the most advanced technology and best trained soldiers in the world, but that doesn't mean shit if you can't get them where they need to be or keep them supplied when they're there. 

Sure, you can defend Germany or France, but what about Estonia &amp; Finland? What if you need to respond immediately, to stop either from falling and it devolving into a nuclear stand-off? You can't do it without the United States. Sure, you can do it in the long-run, but if Estonia &amp; Finland are under Russia's boot, and not in contention, Russia will just threaten a nuclear war if you mobilize and try to re-take them. 

When concerning nuclear powers, whether Russia &amp; the European Union or China &amp; America, any war will either be a nuclear holocaust or a short, limited &amp; decisive one. And this is exactly the type of thing that the Chinese military has been training for and it's Generals &amp; Professors advocating. And as we see in Crimea, Russia has already put it in practice, rather successfully mind you.

Ukraine was an example of an area slipping from their sphere of influence and with an easily disputable area that was once theirs and full of ethnic Russians. Something which they grabbed to lose less. If the riots in Kiev never happened Crimea would still be there as a part of Ukraine.

Therefore, the US is quite capable at launching and maintaining a mission in some deserted hellhole on the other side of the planet. The EU is not very good at doing this, but honestly, doesn't have very much need to do this either.

Et ? En quoi ça rend le FN marginal ?

Le FN n'est absolument pas en marge, il est au contraire au centre du débat médiatique et des propositions politiques. Il lui est indispensable.

Par contre, il est très mal vu chez les BAC+5 de trente ans et plus ainsi que les immigrés, c'est à dire une minorité de la population qui représente pourtant 95% de mes collègues et supérieurs.

&gt;Le FN ne sera jamais dédiabolisé dans le jeu des partis, c'est un doux mythe qui, répété 1000 fois, n'en sera pas plus vrai.

Peu importe, ses idées progressent. Une majorité de la population trouve qu'il y a trop d'immigrés, et la fin de l'euro convainc de plus en plus de personnes.

&gt;Il faudrait que tu m'expliques en quoi ces idées sont spécifiques au FN

Quel autre parti diffuse ces deux idées en même temps ?

&gt;pourquoi elles sont de bonnes solutions aux problèmes actuels

Tout dépend de quels problèmes tu parles.

Et personne ne dit qu'elles vont résoudre tous les problèmes entièrement.

Par contre, je peux te montrer pourquoi la baisse du nombre d'immigrés et le renvoi de clandestins permet de faire baisser le chômage, d'augmenter la rémunération de certains métiers peu qualifiés, baisser les loyers dans certaines zones, baisser un certain type de délinquance, diminuer les dépenses sociales plus fortement que les rentrées fiscales, diminuer les montants nécessaires aux projets d'urbanisme, améliorer la cohésion sociale, et améliorer le sentiment d'insécurité culturelle.

Pour l'euro, je pourrais te montrer comment la dissolution permet de retrouver une croissance à plus de 2% par an, de faire baisser le nombre de chomeurs de 1 millions de personnes en 3 ans,  et de retrouver l’équilibre des régimes de retraites et de protection sociale en deux ans.

Es-tu seulement prêt à écouter ?

&gt;Être une marionnette de Guignol, c'est la raison d'être du FN, pas les ""idées"" ou le ""programme"" de la Marine.

""Non so niente del vostro paese""... andiamo, cosa vuoi che ti rispondiamo, ti riscriviamo tutta la storia d'Italia dalla preistoria ad oggi, magari ordinata per città e con i locali dove mangiare e dormire? Che discussione vuoi che nasca da lì?

After tax income is irrelevant when arguing about exports. Employers pay taxes and social benefits, which have to be taken into account when discussing the costs of goods. 

The underlying statistical data does not take social benefits like healthcare or tuition fees into account.

So?

Germanys main exports are motor vehicles and parts thereof (17.4%), machinery (14.9%) and chemical products (9.6%), accounting for 41,9%.

To remedy that, they created huge databases that were widely accessible for people with high level clearance.

The US lost in Vietnam. It couldn't handle them even with support.

Right away!

* The Crown of Aragon magically becoming the [Catalonian-aragonese crown](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_de_Arag%C3%B3n#Nombres_alternativos).
* Turning your [typical sucession war where the loser side gets punished by having all its benefits removed](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerra_de_Sucesi%C3%B3n_Espa%C3%B1ola) into Braveheart with the Catalonian nation fighting against the Castillian conquering hordes (you and I have discussed about this not so long ago).
* Christopher Columbus [not only being Catalonian](http://www.naciodigital.cat/noticia/42914/noves/proves/demostren/catalanitat/cristofol/colom)...
* ... but he claiming America for the Catalonian-aragonese crown, [and we don't know about it because Castille censured it all](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fShGWiD0jRc). Also he sailed from Pals, Catalonia and not from Palos, Andalusia.

Those were the big four that just came up the top of my head and I'm sure I could find a few more if I were so inclined.

Do you really think my arguments are simplifying the situation? Actually my intentions are to give a more rounded perspective of the whole situation, away from a good vs. evil manichaeism that, I'm afraid, has no basis in reality. The independentist arguments are not always that reasonable (I think I made a good example of this on this thread) and I don't think it's intellectually honest to pretend that they are. Sorry if this bothers you guys, but reality is usually muddy, dirty and complex as hell. Even more when we talk about politics. Pretending otherwise is dishonest and/or naïve, me thinks.

&gt;Can't you think for one instant that among the milions of independentists there are people from all walks of life, some of them maybe more learned, suspicious and intelligent than you? People that think and that are not easily fooled and misled?

Sure. And I can also think about the millions of unionists that are more learned, suspicious and intelligent than yours truly. That doesn't change the fact that my critiques to Catalonian secessionism are not that off the mark.

&gt;... (yeah yeah, you repeteadly said yiou agree with them, but c'mon, i do not buy it, it's just too perfect an excuse)

Sorry I don't fit in whatever comfortable categories you have for political stances. You'll find most people here won't either.

&gt;they made the far right a normal thing, same with your arguments, make both sides unreliable (spanish nationalism being an evil ideology from the beggining, with all the fascist-nazi-dictatorship ties and all) so independentism gets the bad press, 

Loved how Intereconomía now becomes ""the spanish media"". And both sides are unreliable: even when you're right about Spanish nationalism being a fascist creation (and you NEED to ask me about this in a more appropiate thread because Spanish nationalism is kind of interesting) that doesn't make Catalonian nationalism good by default (I've had to deal here with people who suggested Andalusian and Galician immigration towards Catalonia was a conscious effort by the Spanish government to destroy the Catalonian culture, come on).

But if it turns gas off (or increases the price to stupendous levels) only to Eastern Europe, chances are they do that because they do not want to lose the Western Europe markets. So in this case Germans exports to Eastern Europe would simply be a wise business strategy. Imagine it is not gas, but baguettes.

...

Obviously they don't work against Russia. Hmmmmm

&gt;The European Union just can't defend it's citizens there, in a timely and decisive manner, without American support. Simple as that. You lack the capability. 

And this is any different for... let's say Alaska? After all Russia can just blitz it and when they've taken it there's a sudden nuclear standoff and everybody says oh shit sorry people Alaska ain't worth it.

&gt;And Vietnam was a loss of will.

Oh really? You mean just like I just told you? Wow.     
Damn if only we didn't have that same problem in that other place you mentioned...Syria. Wait what do you say? The will wasn't there to begin with? We never went there? Holy shit.

&gt;and any hypothetical war we're talking about would be conventional, even if it's short &amp; limited. 

Something something cold war.

&gt;Think of what would've happened if Winston Churchill wasn't there to keep the Brits committed. 

Yes and what does that have to do with anything?

&gt;Also....weren't many European countries in Afghanistna too? lol 

Yeah. Why did we need to be there again? hmmmmmmm

Also it only illustrates my goddamn point. They were an insurgency. They still exist there. They still control certain areas as opposed to the government of the country. 

&gt;And the scenario I'm talking about is the other side unwilling to mobilize for total war and nuclear holocaust because it lost the short &amp; limited war. 

And you're saying we'd loose the short and limited conventional war. Even though we have a ton more troops. A military budget more then double that of theirs, far more modern equipment and that on our own turf.

Why? Just cause the Russian troops trained for it?

And Estonian resistance is just going to stop once Russian tanks reach the coast? Hmm it's weird that the war in Iraq took 8 years then. 

&gt;As I've pointed out numerous times before, it's why China's training and military doctrine revolves around short, limited &amp; decisive wars. It's why Russia calls tactical nuclear strikes ""de-escalation"". 

If they do tactical nuclear strikes to accomplish this short and limited war in Estonia then they've **already** started a nuclear war. Without those utilising those nukes they **can't** do a short and limited war against the EU and without any lead up to it they can't get any support for it. Ukraine couldn't do anything back. Neither with nukes nor conventionally and there was a long lead up to it.

Yet you kept on going about Mali and the like. We can literally send our troops to the Russian border by fucking train. ",0,1398281365,null,0,1398282274,0,ch05ekj,t3_23rbmd,t1_ch05ekj,t1_ch04hc5,null,1433488465,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

It was done. It was called the Budapest Memorandum and it's why Russia was able to stroll freely into Crimea. 

&gt;Nobody is going to use nukes on disputes that are not on their original territory. Even if it were original territory, nukes would come into play as a last resort - when nothing else is left to lose - when total collapse in unavoidable anyway.

And this only goes to back-up my point completely. Estonia gone doesn't threaten the total collapse of the European Union *(or...maybe it does with this one..but not the other two)*, America or even Western Europe in general *(where the two EU nuclear states are)*. The most important moments will be in the opening act of any conflict; where both countries try to keep the engagement short and limited to Estonia. 

After that, it can go any way. Nuclear holocaust or no action at all. But the one with Estonia will be in the better negotiating position. Hence why power projection and the ability to immediately respond is so vital, and something the EU can't do without the United States.

War überrascht über die Kommentare des Arbeitsrechtlers... sehr interessant. 

Edit: Es ist aber nicht wirklich Sklavenhaltung. Es ist halt ein Job und ich fand es nicht sonderlich schlimm dort zu arbeiten. Ich war allerdings auch nicht längere Zeit da und kann daher zu eventuellen Vorgaben und dem durchdrücken von diesen nichts aus erster Hand sagen. Laut Gesprächen existieren diese aber und wenn man bestimmte Vorgaben nicht erfüllt bekommt man Probleme - wie das konkret Aussieht weiss ich nicht, aber ich denke in der Dokumentation war das ganz anschaulich dargestellt. Ansonsten gibt es leider noch beschissenere Jobs für weniger Geld hier. Das die fiesen Dinge natürlich subtil ablaufen und man davon nichts mitbekommt ist wohl anzunehmen, von daher kann ich dazu nichts sagen. 

Allerdings sieht die Situation für Leute die Arbeitslos sind und vom Jobcenter dorthin verfrachtet werden schon etwas anders aus. Mit 50 oder einer Erkrankung dort zu arbeiten ist unter den Bedingungen sicherlich sehr grenzwertig.

Now if it was 27.73, you don't bother with the complicated stuff, but you know you have some 1 and 2 cent pieces. So you ask ""3 cents?"", give 30 EUR in bills and 3 cents, and get some change back. But you won't get 1/2/5 cent pieces back, so they don't accumulate.

All this doesn't take a lot longer than paying without giving change, or paying with an EC card (which can take really long).

What also happens frequently to me is that I see the final sum, start searching in my purse, and the cashier waits because she expects me to give her small change.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  And I doubt the memories of East Germany's secret police is the only explanation.

You're right that it isn't. Privacy has been a political topic since long before the Reunification. We recently had our first census after eyeballing statistics since the last one some 30 years ago, and even then they devised a statistical model in which most people weren't actually polled. During the previous one, privacy concerns lead to the constitutional right to [informational self-determination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informational_self-determination), which is essentially what the EU privacy directive has been modeled after.  
Privacy has come up as a *major* political issue several times since then, and practically always won out over the security and law-enforcement side of the argument. In 2008, we got another constitutional right out of it, the beautifully named [fundamental right to the guarantee of the confidentiality and integrity of information technology systems](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grundrecht_auf_Gew%C3%A4hrleistung_der_Vertraulichkeit_und_Integrit%C3%A4t_informationstechnischer_Systeme), which set a particularly high threshold for the search of digital communication and devices. That's the one the [federal trojan](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/chaos-computer-club-anatomy-of-a-digital-pest-11508378.html) was in violation of. Not because of what it *did*, but because of what it *could* have been used to do due to its capability to be extended, which is something the Constitutional Court had *specifically* banned in its verdict. This was a *major* scandal, even though this trojan had only been used in about a dozen instances, so it's not as if it had been widely deployed.  
Another example would be the Constitutional Court's ruling that ended [data retention](http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention), which resulted in Germany's non-compliance with the EU data retention directive (the one that the EU Court finally killed off the other day). An indicator for how big those issues have been here is that FAZ and Zeit, the newspapers I linked to in the previous two examples, don't normally publish articles in English but did in those exceptional cases.

With the exception of Austria, Germany (unfortunately) is also the only country [not covered](http://i.imgur.com/4J8EGSi.jpg) by Google Street View, because the instinctive reaction by the paranoid public was to reject it for privacy reasons.

Bonne question. Pour moi, je dirai qui remet en cause certains aspects fondamentaux de la situation actuelle.

&gt; Est-ce que tu fais la même critique aux positions des autres ?

Sans problème. Il se trouve que tu es l'un des seuls qui essayent de tenir des raisonnements. Je ne prends pas la peine de critiquer ceux qui sortent une phrase remplie d’inepties sans aucun argument.

&gt; En particulier les postulats de l'économie libérale ?

Aucun souci, je ne suis pas un fan du libéralisme absolu. D'ailleurs, il me semble que le libéralisme ne doit jamais être considéré d'un point de vu absolu mais d'un point de vue relatif. Mon opinion, c'est qu'on a besoin de plus de libéralisme en France, mais il ne faut pas en même temps supprimer un interventionnisme lorsqu'il est justifié. Typiquement, je n'encouragerai pas l'éducation privée car elle peut être contraire au principe d'égalité des chances.

&gt; Non, tu as oublié une étape fondamentale dans mon raisonnement, où j'explique pourquoi il est impossible qu'il y ait convergence politique un jour. On a évalué le coût pour l'Allemagne d'un fédéralisme. Par exemple ici. C'est inenvisageable.

J'ai pas de souvenirs d'arguments là-dessus de ta part, j'ai du les rater. Ton lien est intéressant, mais ne représente pas une vérité absolue non plus : il part de l'hypothèse que la convergence doit être totale et que les pays du sud ne progressent pas. Donc, une hypothèse contestable et un phénomène conjoncturel.

&gt; C'est pour cela que je demande systématiquement de sourcer vos propos et de me citer.

Citer, c'est bien. Mais ça ne doit pas remplacer une logique. Il y a plein de sources particulièrement absurde et partiale que je peux citer.

There's this magical thing called land and Estonia is connected to it as well as Russia. Through a damn large border even.

and yeah. Kalinigrad would be absolute toast.

Oh and yes all those submarines. 
Firstly. They have one bloody harbour to go with in the Baltic sea. A nice place that surely won't be targeted huh.

Secondly it has become increasingly easy to find them with the years. Especially in such a confined area. Their nuclear attack and guided missile submarines are all incredibly old. The only stuff they are really keeping up with are ballistic submarines and that for exactly the reason you mentioned. Nuclear power projection... and you act as if the rest of Europe doesn't have submarines and anti submarine frigates.

Peoria. Pretty much every male you meet here under the age of 30 is an engineer at caterpillar or komatsu. Both of these companies also have plenty of other positions not requiring an engineering degree that pay well also. Almost everyone I know is making around $70k/yr and we are all around 25-28.

&gt;I don't get home that often but from what I've heard people have been leaving the state in droves until recently

This is possible. However, everything I have read about people leaving Illinois has little to do with the economy, and much more to do with higher taxes relative to other states (and fucking horrible weather).

&gt;There's also the issue of getting a decent job without a degree.

Yeah this blows, but a buddy of mine works in IT without a degree and makes like $18/hr. It's not a whole lot, but you can't really expect to make much more being 25 without a degree.

&gt;I know from my high school only a minority could afford to get secondary education.

Well if in state tuition is as much as you say, I completely understand. However, there are always an abundance of scholarships people are far too lazy to apply for (like I was in college) that can reduce the costs quite a bit. But yeah, it's either that or take out loans.

Illinois must have ridiculous college costs. My tuition in AZ was $3000 per semester (I think its $4000 now). The figure you mentioned seems more like out of state tuition or private school tuition.

Something tells me you don't have a fucking clue about geography.

I'll give you some hints. Ukraine is nowhere near the baltics and Estonia's border with Latvia is nearly as big as it's border with Russia.

Mali was only a French thing and they only used support in the form of transport. Without it would have taken longer but it wouldn't be a huge matter of time  anyway

&gt;I don't think you quite understand how important time is in a war, especially a limited one.

I don't think you understand the way Finish military defence is build up. I don't think you understand geography. 
I don't think you understand that you don't just win a war nowadays by defeating local military. I don't think you understand how nuclear deterrent and military alliances work. I don't think you understand the speed needed to get to the eastern front. I don't think you understand that Russia's only border with the EU is not Latvia. I don't think you understand which side Ukraine (A different big Russian border) would be on in this conflict. I don't think you understand the massive economic deterrent.

Maybe I think that you do actually understand at least half of those things but completely ignore them to push your argument.

Seriously are you trolling?

2% GDP spending isn't comparable to 5-10% GDP spending. Ensuring your country is safe &amp; secure can go a long way in fostering the environment needed for that kind of legislation. Plus, Poland is one of the strongest and fastest growing economies in the EU. 

Just like America's military spending isn't holding back it's social spending, or the commonly-repeated lie that the only reasons Europeans have good social security nets is because of there subsidized security from America *(though it DOES make it cheaper)*.

It's actually rather infuriating being a American; because given the immense leverage our military affords us on the international scene and the strong trade benefits this affords us, it would be cheaper to reinforce that social security now than in the case we lose that international precedence. I can't help, but draw similarities with the UK and the end of the British Empire. It would've been *way more affordable &amp; easier* to set-up such a system when the Empire was at it's height instead of when it was at it's twilight. 

Also, keep in mind, I really doubt that the European Union would've even happened had it not been for the security &amp; stability the United States, France &amp; the United Kingdom guaranteed to it's predecessor organization *(European Atomic Energy Community &amp; the European Coal &amp; Steel Community)* through NATO.

&gt;With this understanding, we, as the Turkish Republic, have called for the establishment of a joint historical commission in order to study the events of 1915 in a scholarly manner. This call remains valid. Scholarly research to be carried out by Turkish, Armenian and international historians would play a significant role in shedding light on the events of 1915 and an accurate understanding of history.

There's already a vast international consensus on the facts of the Armenian genocide. It does not line up with current Turkish views at all. The onus of proof now lies with the Turkish side. It's their historians who would have to present new research to sway the global scientific community's views towards their perspective. This proposal is a backhanded attempt to sidestep the status quo and pass the burden of proof back to the international community. Participating in this ""commission"" would be an admission that already well established facts are up for debate.

true,100courics,HUNG,Hungary,"I think it's important to highlight the context of EU-US relations. Last time the US was like, ""fuck off, Yurop, it's not my problem,"" the Second World War happened. Yes the world loves to go like, ""USA blows this, USA sucks that..."" but it most likely would've been an even more horrific place right now, had the US not bothered - of course this is hypothetical. However, one of the habits the US has is to stick around after the invasion to make sure the procedure was worth its time, which is a fair demand.

Since the War, however, the US has been locked into its self-created role of World Police. Ukraine is a member of the Partnership for Peace program of NATO. The program itself is more symbolic than practical - let alone binding - but it shows that NATO member states (notably the US) began placing interest in the given state. Thus, while NATO is officially merely a mutual defense pact, becoming a partner of it has many more effects in the long run. Thus, while a full-scale invasion wouldn't be justified in terms of NATO use, the US may just judge the situation as it did 60 years ago: I either help them now, or will have to invade them in ten years because they'll be overrun.

The love-hate analogy is partially true, but most Europeans subconsciously HAVE to be happy about NATO membership because, if they weren't, nothing would keep them from being next on Russia's hitlist. It's very easy to complain about the US when it does something immoral like Iraq or Afghanistan. But it's only so easy for (western in some cases) Europeans because they had the pillow known as the US to land on when they fell for decades now.

Lithuania is connected with Poland and there are works starting on trans-baltic railway through Finland-Estonia-Latvia-Lithuania (plans laid down, finance almost there, companies already preping constructions etc). Also, Baltic sea can be easily closed and taken control of by EU, because it surrounds Baltic Sea completely, while Russia has only two entry points (one of which is more like an isolated lonely island surrounded by angry men). Sweden, Poland and Germany have direct access to Baltic sea and can use it to deliver ships, army, supplies. The distance from Germany to Baltic states through Baltic Sea is about 800 km, 600-400 km from Poland and 200 - 300 km from Sweden. They can mobilize and arrive for help on time. In addition, many of their avionics are in operational range for air combat on Baltic heavens.

Regarding your links, I appreciate these. But excuse my skepticism...I really don't think ""Pledge of no first use"" ever meant anything other than some populist deals. Even the article you linked says:

&gt; ""No one there or here ever had a 'no first use' policy,"" he said. ""Only very naive people ever believed that. It doesn't mean any change in operations, in readiness, in technology, targeting. It's just a very practical statement for a country that now has few other ways of warning off attacks on its territory.""

In general, Soviet Union and Russian Federation do not differ much in terms of military tactics and nuclear deterrent strategies. I do not find these posturings surprising, they always liked to wave their nuclear weapons and frighten everybody. That set aside, a nuclear strike on say Estonia would be a nuclear strike on EU. EU would respond immediately. Pretty sure Russian military generals would be deterred by this fact themselves, too. Unless suicidal...which is a possibility

c'est assez facile de détecter des gens qui ne discutent pas dans le sens où ils ne reprennent pas les propos-mêmes qu'ils quotent et partent sur des tangentes qu'eux-seuls comprennent car venant d'un discours réappliqué machinalement

Avoir tort ne veut pas dire être fêlé, et encore moins ne pas être baisable.

Tu as mal lu, je t'ai justement demandé de quels problèmes tu voulais parler. À quel page du bréviaire me renvoies-tu ? Une citation serait la bienvenue.

Je n'ai pas dit ""personne"". Encore une fois, tu confonds la minorité de dirigeant avec l'ensemble de la population.

J'ai dit que les dirigeants ne le cherchaient pas, et j'ai expliqué pourquoi. Jamais dit que le FN était le seul à le chercher. À nouveau, tu préfères avoir tort ou être un menteur ?

&gt;On a déjà eu la discussion non ? 

Où ?

&gt;La dévaluation n'est pas une solution pérenne aux déficits et à la perte de compétitivité économique. 

Personne n'a prétendu que la dévaluation était une solution à long terme ou qu'une fois la dévaluation faite c'était terminé. C'est facile de réfuter des thèses que personne ne soutient.

&gt;Donc ils ont fait le choix de pouvoir continuer à refinancer la dette.

Source ? Ils ont fait le choix idéologique de l'Europe dans le SME, rien à voir avec la dette. Le [Black Wednesday](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros#.C2.AB_L.27homme_qui_fit_sauter_la_banque_d.27Angleterre_.C2.BB) est d'ailleurs un très bon exemple de cas où l'attachement au SME a coûte des milliards alors qu'une sortie avec dévaluation aurait rapporté des milliards au Trésor Britannique.

Sometimes I wonder what could have been. But yeah, only the top people get their choice of school so it's hit and miss with a lot of pain in between.

""Prépa"" is to prepare for the competitive admissions test for the top engineering schools. They offer a limited number of spots depending on your score and ranking. There are different tiers of engineering schools in France.

One tip : google the email address of your correspondent, or copy/paste some parts of the description of the apartment. Usually, web pages denouncing a scam pop up... because they get lazy, they keep using the same emails and the same descriptions... I bet you'll find your guy.

Regarding the documents (id scan and such), they use it to scam other people... so you could end up having issues, being flagged as a scammer.

I don't know if Sciences-Po does a good job or not helping the foreign students on apartment issues. I hope so. However, since, you asked, it's never too early to start looking. Finding a flat in Paris is difficult.

However, don't send money unless you use a very well known intermediary, like AirBnb for example. Be careful also with offers on ""leboncoin.fr"", a major French website (a sort of Craigslist). It is quite useful to buy stuff but many scams are reported.

And don't buy lists of available apartments from real estate agencies. They're not technically scams but the information is outdated, or they just copy/paste from ads they find elsewhere... just bullshit, and they will never reimburse you.

You may also ask the Thai embassy in Paris if they provide a list of serious agencies.

Sorry if I sound scary... if you can afford it, you should come maybe 2 or 3 weeks before the beginning of courses, rent a place through AirBnb and look for a place by yourself.

My 2 cents: open an account in a French bank, make a deposit for the whole six months of rent that you will offer as a guarantee to the landlord. It's a common procedure. Of course, the landlord can't in any way touch it if you pay your rent on time ; but if you don't, it's not too difficult for him to get paid. As far as I know, it is the only way to offer a guarantee, except if you have family or friends living in France ready to sign papers saying they will pay if you don't...

*he Crown of Aragon magically becoming the Catalonian-aragonese crown*

The Crown of Aragon did not magically became the catalan-aragonese crown, what happened was that the usual ""Corona d'Aragó i de Catalunya"" was simplified documentally to ""Corona d'Aragó"" from the XIV century onwards in the royal chancillery documents. A simple observer analysis of the history of the origins and developement of the crown will show to you that it is absurd and ridiculous to diminish the weight and importance of Catalonia (the Principality of Catalonia, which was the official name of Catalonia until 1833) in the crown, since the kingdom of aragon was given as a dowry to the count of barcelona, the royal chancillery was in Barcelona, the archives were in Barcelona, the ruling house was catalan, the imperial expansion was done basically by catalans (València, Mallorques, Naples, Sicily, greece, etc), the law was for the most part catalan (based on the gothic law, the only western european nation to mantain it for that long), etc. 

This ""catalano-aragonese"" controversy just exist as a way to try to diminish the history of catalonia and deny its existence as a nation, a controversy, as most of them, outside the academia, just like the catalan-valencian controversy, done for political reasons. The crown of aragon was as catalan as aragonese (constitutionally speaking) and mostly catalan in everything else, from economy, to foreign policy, to the military. 

Just to add a sensationalist argument you are sure to like: 

*Magna est profecto gloria nationis catalanae diebus nostris: Papa, catalanus; Rex Aragonum et Sicilae, catalanus; vicecancellarius, catalanus; capitaneus ecclesiae, catalanus; generalis ordinis minorum, catalanus*

I am sure a learned man like yourself does not need a translation, it's preety easy to understand anyways.

This was written by the second catalan pope (Alexander VI Borgia, from a Valencian family), I think its pretty clear he made no distinctions between catalonia and the crown of aragon. Would you call the pope a ""sheepy nationalist""? Or maybe the most reasonable answer is that catalonia was a normal nation in that context, just like france or england or scotland or Denmark were.

If you want historical lies and revisionism you just have to go to the PP chiefs and their ""spain is the oldest nation in europe"" hit (personally, i think not even they are stupid enough to believe that). 

As you said we indeed talked about the war of spanish succession, but again, you keep repeating things which are unaccurate or just very uninformed. First of all, there's anything but typical in a modern succession war, and both the spanish and the austrian succession war which followed it, were huge world wars, with hundreds of thousands of casualties and huge consequences for the main parties involved. 

The catalans, just like any people, didn't fought in the war, ""for some king or for another"", . They were fighting for their way of life, for the laws that governed them, for the land their consodered it was theirs. You also mistake modern era ""privileges"" for ""benefits"" when the most accurate contemporary translation would be ""constitutional rights"" of the catalan people, rights which predated the union of crowns between the kingdom of castile and the crown of aragon and which were earned by the catalans through history (such as not having to serve in foreign wars, the inviolability of the homes, the right to elect mayors, etc).
 Just like in the other conversation we had you just take what you like of history (from wikipedia?) and then anachronise it as you please; last time you told me of XVIII century europe as if it was XI century europe, with the people having absolutely no say in government, something that england, holland and other countries would have something to say about. Catalonia had its own constitutional system back then, and it was the reason the people tried to defend it from bourbon absolutism. It had nothing to do with independence, and most catalans know the difference between the rights we had back then and actual contemporary independent states.

And finally, this ""Columbus was catalan thing"". Well, Columbus has as good a chance to being catalan as being from italy, several members of tyhe expedition were catalan, and catalonia was still an important mediterranean power with lots of connections. 

There's an important claim, with evidence to support it, as a historian i give it a chance. And Pals could have been the catalan pals and not the andalusian one, I dare you to offer more proof to one option than the other, isntead of ridiculing it. The other looney ideas, like a catalan claim of america or that castille activelly suppressed its just a fringe idea with no support in the academic community, and most of the catalan public is not even aware of the claim existing in the first place. 

This kind of argumentation you put forward as a ""catalan independentist claim"" is very similar to something that happened in china several years ago, when chinese media went ballistic because they said koreans beleived confucious to be korean; this was absolutely bogus, no korean thinks that, but maybe some loon in some backwatee village published it on his blog, and sensationalist chinese journalists inmediately picked on it, and many chinese still bnelieve that koreans in general aknowledge confucious as korean, when it is completely false. 

What is more, did you know were all this columbus claims come from? From the Institut Nova Historia, a fringe research group liederated by Jordi Bilbeny, a man who claims davinci himself was catalan; does any university in catalonia (which are amongst the best in spain, BTW) consider him a serious scholar? No, he has no prestige or respect or anything between in the academic community, and even the documentary you cite wasn't claiming that.

You are right in that there is a general frustration in the US about the lack of unity in the EU, but that's not the real problem when it comes to Ukraine. The real problem is that, while most sides agree that what Russia did was bad, no one actually cares enough to do much about it. Pissing off Russia too much just isn't worth the hassle. I mean, it wouldn't be World War 3, or even a crashed economy, but especially because of all the fossil fuels that Russia is pumping out to the west, it could at least be a big inconvenience. And what does saving Ukraine get us? AT best, we get a warm fuzzy feeling for helping the Ukrainians out, at worst we get sucked into a civil war. It's a lot of risk, for very little reward. 

As for your question, if the US or the EU wasn't around, the EU or the US would probably just keep doing what it was already doing. Halfhearted sanctions, and strongly worded letters. Maybe the US would apply some slightly harsher sanctions if it didn't have to worry about the opinion of the EU, but that would really be the limit. Even giving Ukraine weapons is an unpopular idea, and military action is out of the question.

&gt;  From the outside, without knowing all that, it makes Germany's reaction to all these spying scandals hard to understand.

Sure, it must seem artificial because there's no real reference to relate it to, so we tend to apply the conventions we're familiar with from our own societies. From a German perspective, it's incomprehensible how Americans seemingly find it acceptable that many employers test employees for drugs, for example.  
I believe that a lot of the mutual criticism between Americans and Europeans have their roots not in the cultural differences, but in the similarities. *Because* our cultures are so similar, we tend to apply our own expectations towards how something is supposed to be, without taking into account that we're dealing with a different culture. So, we criticize the wide-meshed social net in the US, or things like the death penalty and generally much harsher sentences, but hardly anybody bats an eye when e.g., China diverts even further from what would be European values. In reverse, Americans believe that laws against Holocaust denial or restrictions on gun ownership mean we're less free.

Pour montrer le ridicule de ta thèse de la centralité du FN dans le débat politique. Comme si l'insécurité, le chômage, l'immigration avait attendu le FN pour exister ou pour faire l'objet de récupération par des partis. Cela s'appelle une hyperbole. 

&gt;Tu préfères avoir tort ou être un menteur ?

Je préfère parler en bonne intelligence avec quelqu'un qui admet la capacité du langage à dire plus que ce qui est écrit. Malheureusement, j'ai une faible girouette qui me condamne à des débats picrocholesques car elle s'est levée du pied gauche ( ou qu'elle n'accepte pas le détournement d'un fil à sa gloire ). 

&gt;c'est assez facile de détecter des gens qui ne discutent pas dans le sens où ils ne reprennent pas les propos-mêmes qu'ils quotent et partent sur des tangentes qu'eux-seuls comprennent car venant d'un discours réappliqué machinalement

Non, c'est une référence explicite aux différentes interventions de Monsieur Philippot et les tiennes notamment sur Hénin-Beaumont. Si le FN était si central, il ne serait pas constamment dans la dénonciation des individus, ou sur de sujets annexes qui antagonisent à peu de frais. C'est aussi marrant de te voir citer forces études où le FN n'a été ni parti pris, ni associé, ni rien du tout. Agréger n'importe quoi, ne rien développer, faire diversion. Ouais, on a vu. Cela ne marche que dans *Des Paroles et des Actes*

&gt;Avoir tort ne veut pas dire être fêlé, et encore moins ne pas être baisable.
 
Oui. Fallait le relever. Merci. 

&gt;Tu as mal lu, je t'ai justement demandé de quels problèmes tu voulais parler. À quel page du bréviaire me renvoies-tu ? Une citation serait la bienvenue.

A défaut un aphorisme. *Immigration et Sortie de l'Euro sont les deux mammelles du FN.*

&gt;J'ai dit que les dirigeants ne le cherchaient pas, et j'ai expliqué pourquoi. Jamais dit que le FN était le seul à le chercher. À nouveau, tu préfères avoir tort ou être un menteur ?

Non, tu n'as rien expliqué. Tu as juste posé un lien sur la répartition des richesses. Qui n'établit aucun lien de cause à effet avec ce que recherchent les dirigeants. Ni sur ce que le FN rechercherait réellement. A nouveau, soit tu ne te rends pas compte de ce que tu dis dans une espèce de pathologie soralienne, soit tu mens. 

&gt;Tu es semblable aux peuplades qui expliquent par de la magie ce qu'elles ne comprennent pas.

Et toi semblable à celles qui voient dans le verbe une preuve ontologique. Ce n'est pas parce que ça a été écrit quelque part à quelque moment par quelque quidam que c'est **VRAI**.

&gt;Un peu de lecture sur l'euro alors : ici et ici.

Une vidéo et un rapport de scénarii de 100 pages. Aucun n'ont la vertu de la preuve ni même de la comparaison. En passant, la fondation Res Publica appartient au Che. C'est quand même bien proche du PS. 

&gt;Où ?

Historique, d'il y a au moins un an. 

&gt;Personne n'a prétendu que la dévaluation était une solution à long terme ou qu'une fois la dévaluation faite c'était terminé. C'est facile de réfuter des thèses que personne ne soutient.

Non, personne :wink:. Surtout pas les prophètes du FN. Sauf qu'historiquement chaque dévaluation est la der des der. Jusqu'à la suivante. 

&gt;Source ? Ils ont fait le choix idéologique de l'Europe dans le SME, rien à voir avec la dette. Le Black Wednesday est d'ailleurs un très bon exemple de cas où l'attachement au SME a coûte des milliards alors qu'une sortie avec dévaluation aurait rapporté des milliards au Trésor Britannique.

Il y a des coûts et des bénéfices à chaque changement de statu quo. Le problème des dévaluations est qu'elles enterrinent le changement càd les faiblesses des économies qui en ont besoin. Mais elles ne résolvent pas les causes. S'il y a eu trois dévaluations entre 81 et 83, c'est que les nationalisations et les hausses des prestations en impactant négativement l'économie les avaient rendues nécessaires. Pas le SME. D'ailleurs comme d'hab', tu quotes le cadre et non la cause. 

&gt;Ce sera donc la pitié.

Je n'en ai pas besoin non plus. 

&gt;Pauvre chou. Définitivement la pitié.

Chacun son fardeau. Quand je te vois prêcher dans le vide alors que tu sais pertinemment que tu mens, je me demande qel cheminement (psycho)logique aboutit à cette stratégie de la baudruche.

Ta phrase est tournée comme si je devais te rendre des comptes. Permets-moi cordialement de t'inviter à manger ta merde. 

&gt;Tu as honte d'être Français, tu l'as toi-même dit.

Ben comme tout le monde, je l'espère. Mais même sur internet, on a le droit de ne pas être catégorique. Y a des bons côtés et des mauvais côtés. Le nationalisme prétend établir un lien charnel, filial qui abolit toute remise en cause. Si c'est ton trip, pourquoi pas.

This right here is the reason, Turkey will not accept anything. I am sure more than 95% of the Armenians think like this and this is what is keeping any apology from happening. This issue isn't a moral issue anymore. This became a political matter just as Erdogan is saying. There is a long history of Western countries fucking with Ottoman Empire as well as Turkey and this has left(unfortunately) a mark on the people. Turkish people doesn't trust any country at all. It doesn't help that there are many Armenians, Greeks... hating the Turks for everything that had happened doesn't help. There needs to be compromise from both sides if we are to see any improvement.

Hell you seen what happened with the summer protests. We were called terrorists, Armenians, Greeks, traitors, gays, infidels, Jews just because we opposed Erdogan and his corruptions. We can't even accept ourselves and you guys are waiting for a big apology. As much as I want to see Armenian-Turkish relations to improve, its not gonna happen.

I'm not in any way optimistic, free market capitalists like Reinfeldt and his lackeys have been spreading neo-liberalism in such an irreversible manner so that even the social democrats and other left wingers are convinced of subscribing to all kinds of cancerous destructive policies just feeding the dismantling of the welfare state.


All our current parties are in effect neo-liberals in action, their virtual voicelessness or critique is condoning everything destructive that is done to Sweden, from privatizing government entities since decades now, the neglect of the education system, to mass importing uneducated workforce and abandoning any kind of responsible immigration policies for utopian damaging concepts such as multiculturalism, which is not to be confused with multiethnicism which is a valid humanist concept.


It's like our political class was hijacked by Goldman-sachs and marxist hippies combined, any responsibility and rationality being eliminated for profiteering and utopian globalist dreams, which happen to coincide well for the capitalist ideals whereas the hippies are too spaced out to understand what they are destroying, in the process of failing to check the neo-liberal agenda the basis for the whole humanist tolerant mindset in Sweden will be destroyed in the end, in favour of a dog eat dog society.


The worst part is that people don't seem to care/understand in general, they still look at our party structure as something self-explanatory, democratic and innocent, often even defending the policies of the government which strictly run on ""economic growth"" as an indicator on social progress for them, when often the opposite is true.


To give a closer glimpse what kinds of people we are dealing with, have a look at this. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sueK7f30hyU

Unfortunately it is in Swedish, the gist of it is simply that Reinfeldt already as a younger man in 1993 is promoting the ideals that the welfare concept is something unsustainable, how the welfare state needs to be dismantled.


He is doing exactly that, turning Sweden into some kind of capitalist abomination one step at a time, and he is not alone in trying to do that.

No other entity that has performed similarly atrocious crimes has put in nearly as much effort as Germany has in this way. The way the war is treated in Japan is fucking disgusting and it's a disgrace.

The number of lives lost in the procurement of slaves remains a mystery but may equal or exceed the number who survived to be enslaved.[68]

So 1.2-2.4 million, plus more than that, and an unknown number that died/were killed while still in Africa. Clearly this should be considered a genocide? Does it not qualify because the purpose was not primarily extermination but enslavement?

Most indigenous Americans died as a result of disease or starvation. This was a direct result of the Europeans outspoken plan to conquer the land to use for their own. Similarly in the Ottoman Empire, while a few people were summarily executed, most deaths came as a result of disease and starvation due to the forced relocation.

28 countries which have huge levels of integration and pooled sovereignty. 

One is officially one country, and one is officially 28 countries. However the USA grants some of the highest levels of autonomy to its component parts of any country in the World (even including other federal states) whilst the European Union is the most integrated set of independent states in the world. Whilst officially both entities would tick two different boxes, they're still incredibly similar (well, speaking relatively and only in terms of governing structure at the highest level). It's like the Labour party in the UK being officially ""of the left"" and the Conservative party being officially ""of the right"", however, you can get individuals in both parties who sit very close to the left-right divide. So much so, that those individuals share almost exactly the same ideological outlook, despite being in ideologically opposed parties (or ticking completely different boxes). 

It's for the reasons outlined above that making a comparison between the European Union and the USA makes sense, whilst making a comparison between the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) and the Russian Federation doesn't. 

On the other hand, it would probably also be disngenuous to compare the European Union (or even the United States to a certain extent) with a fully unitary state like Japan, because Japan is definitely in the ""country"" box, but it is very much in one corner of that box whilst the USA sets at the opposite end (in terms of governing structure) and the EU sits in a completely different box entirely.",0,1398318468,null,0,false,0,ch0mecd,t3_23tzy7,t1_ch0mecd,t1_ch0l535,null,1433496545,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

So arguably they are equally as atrocious as attempted genocide.

Either way, the US apologized for both those things and doesn't deny that they happened, were terrible, and were the fault of the US government.  That's what I was taught in school in the US.  The US is therefore in a different camp than Turkey.  Like Germany, we've admitted that those things were wrong and were our country's fault.

It is true that people view them as very long ago wrongs, however.  The 19th century seems like ancient history to Americans.

Thinking about it right now, I'd say the Vietnam War is the atrocity that the US is most in denial about.  Nevertheless, many Americans believe that the Vietnam War was an atrocity.  That's what my parents raised me to believe.

Probably because officially, campaigning starts tomorrow.

PNTCD has been engaging in ""pre-campaign self-promotion"".

You'll notice that I wrote three whole paragraphs to accurately explain my position. If I could have summed it up in one sentence like ""Texas and California are more independent than the UK and Italy"" then I would have saved myself the time and wrote that.

Still a big difference.

Take the military budget comparison, for example.  The US military is one unified system.  The combined military budgets of EU countries do not fund one military system.  There are many redundancies and an overall lack of coordination.  The EU has no unified military command structure.  So in that respect, the US and EU aren't comparable.
