Je pense que [la page wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_gills_%28human%29) va nous mettre d'accord vu que l'on a raison tout les 2 :)

&gt; * An average diver with a fully closed-circuit rebreather needs 1 liter (roughly 1 quart) of oxygen per minute. As a result, at least **192 litres  of sea water per minute** would have to be passed through the system

&gt; * A diver needs, on average, about 1 mole of oxygen gas per hour. **Water contains 88% oxygen** by weight, and as two molecules of water are necessary to produce one molecule of diatomic oxygen gas, about **36 grams of water are needed to produce 32 grams of oxygen** . Assuming 1.0 as the density of water, **36 ml of water needs to be converted to oxygen per hour**

Tu assumes que l'on ne fait qu'une branchie géante donc oui pour un humaine cela ne serait pas pratique

A few thoughts though: French Riviera in the summer is overcrowded, it might be hard to find cheap housing. Marseille to Menton in July or August is going to be very, very hot. Not a good time of the year to hike long distance. 

So if I were given the choice I'd hike the GR51 before summer (think May / June), or in July / August I would go on another GR (in the Alps or in Brittany).

Anyway, the best source for infos is probably this one: (http://www.gr-infos.com/gr-en.htm).

There you go, citizens of various political convictions. Unfortunately I haven't been able to proof that the local citizens were pro Russians, but neither did the media. And no, the make up girl does not represent the whole region.

""The SMM accompanied 100 Malaysian, Australian and Dutch experts, who accessed areas associated with the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17. The SMM and the expert team were escorted by armed personnel, at different stages, from the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk “People’s Republics” (“DPR” and “LPR”). [...]

The head of the village administration of Petropavlivka handed over some personal belongings of the crash victims, which local people had collected and taken to the municipal building.  ""

The SMM, together with 64 experts and police, went to the village of Rozsypne (73 km east of Donetsk city), where inhabitants handed over some personal belongings of the victims of the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 crash. 

[...]

The experts reconfirmed that the “Emergency Services” of the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” (“DPR”) had, in conducting search operations, behaved in a professional manner. 

http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/122466

&gt;Everything could have been properly arranged with help from the international community had the ""rebel"" leadership not obstructed and hampered the investigation.

The separatist leadership hindered the OSCE first 2 days after the crash, which might not be ideal but is understandable given the confusion that must have existed and the fact that they are operating in a war zone. Then the media turned it into a story, based on a claim by the Ukrainian Army. 

&gt;It was ""used"" exactly as it should: a report on the "" separatists' "" clumsy propaganda attempt using passenger belongings they shouldn't have touched with their dirty, murderous drunken claws.

No, it was not. It's a prime example of propaganda, simple and clear. You do not distort truth and that's final. You're the gullible audience of a media campaign, or more like it, a show. A show where we can all be angry and hateful while rooting for our favorite team, how enjoyable.

&gt;You should get on your knees and beg the Dutch people for mercy and forgiveness.

The media should.

&gt;I can prove my claims with reliable sources while you keep conjuring up easily debunked Russian lies or stories pulled from your effeminate Belgian-impersonating troll ass.

Effeminate Belgian, says the Dutchman. But alright, prove me the Russian involvement in the crash without using crackpot propaganda outlets or manipulated Western media who have proven themselves corrupt with embarrassing frauds.

&gt;Prove it.

This, is the money shot ladies and gentlemen. 

When the UK signed up to Europe there was no talk of federalisation, single currency and the rest. It was the single market which was, and still is a fantastic idea. Its simplicity belies its genius. 

The reason the UK is so tired of Europe is as in the build up to the euro, we experienced Black Wednesday where we found out the hard way that it is impossible to maintain diverse economies and currencies within a centralised Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).

At this point we realised the hard way that the euro was a dangerous project, where the risks incredulously outweighed the benefits.

Since then Europe has pretended this didn't happen and continued down the route, despite the well intentioned messages of caution from Britain. As a result, Britain has been painted as a 'stick in the mud', [causing hold-ups and problems for the rest of Europe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRmc9IPGmiA).

What you don't see is that Britain loves Europe like family, and family means tough love and truth, not sycophantic arse licking. If you want that you can find a multitude of eastern states all terrified of Putin, who will whisper sweet nothings in your ear about how amazing the euro is, ^so ^long ^as ^you ^protect ^them.

We crashed our car drink driving in the ERM. Now we have spent close to 10 years watching you driving around town drunk, before you finally had a huge crash. 

Now for the past 5 years, Europe is hungover. All the Southern states who were sat in the back seat with no seatbelt are crippled - maybe forever. The North, who had seat-belts and airbags still have major concussion and broken ribs. 

Rather than pile in with 'I told you so's', but all we here are messages about how great drink driving is, and actually the problem was that you didnt drink drive enough. To be safe and secure you need to drink and drive much more. 

[Actually it all reminds me of this sketch show.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ew8rdu7ZY4&amp;t=0m35s)

There are still **no answers** on how to resolve the crisis. Europe is stuck in a dream world where letting things collapse is slow motion is seen as preferable to big shocks and honest discussion about the problems.

Anyway, it all reminds me of the quote by William Pitt the Younger.

&gt;*I return you many thanks for the honour you have done me; but Europe is not to be saved by any single man. England has saved herself by her exertions, and will, as I trust, save Europe by her example.*

We love Europe. We love europeans. We love the single market. We love the diversity of culture. 

Yes Roma gypsies are a bit of a pain, but do not for one minute make the mistake of thinking that we want to leave because of a few beggars. We as a nation are a product of immigration.

Right now the British left is fractured, and a lot of the 'little england' votes are abandoning the Labour party. There is an election next year and the UKIP bounce is because they are making the right noises to this demographic. You can probably do research and see that Farage rarely talked about immigration before he had his infamous meeting with Murdoch.

We want out because Brussels is corrupts and unnecessary. Europe has a strong future and we want to be part of it, at the heart of it, **but we will not step inside the car with you again until you admit you have a problem and take the right steps to detox**.

* Most of the houses in the city's historical centre have been retrofitted with an elevator, unless the building is too small (only 2/3 storeys) or old to house one. Those without an elevator may come with a stairlift.

* The condos built during the building spree of the late 19th/early 20th century are spacious enough to allow for a lift to be installed, or for the stairwells to be retrofitted. The smaller standing houses built during that period generally don't need one as they're only two to three storeys high, but since many are owned by (relatively) wealthy people and/or are located in poshier parts of town, some have lifts nevertheless.

* Postwar housing was built with lifts in mind so finding a condo without one is unlikely (unless you happen to live in one of those places in the city's outskirts which was built illegally during the '60s...).

* Council houses seem to be an exception. The bigger and more modern ones do, in fact, come with lifts but the older ones (built more or less in the 1920s) don't, and my grandma lives in one. In that particular case, the stairwell is too tight and the roof too weak to support a lift, so they're thinking of putting one outside and the entrance will be provided by what are currently the landing's windows.

On top of that you need to hire services like more TV channels, internet and phone. 

The reason for this is because the company that owns the (old) phone line is required to let other companies use it. So if A owns the line and you want internet from B then B needs to pay A €10 for usage of their line.

Zudem kommt es ja auch oft darauf an, aus welchem Blickwinkel man auf ein Ereignis schaut.

Ein Beispiel:

Viele, auch unsere Medien erzählen ja die Verschwörungstheorie von der Annexion der Krim. Da soll sich der böse Lord Vladimir mit seiner Truppe gegen die freie Welt verschworen haben, ganz offiziell mit Brieg und Siegel und hat dann die Krim annektiert.

Das ist natürlich schon beim ersten hinsehen als Schwachsinn enttarnt. Da gab es keine Verschwörung, die Interessen der Russen an ihrem Hafen sowie dem Schutz der eigenen Bevölkerung waren offensichtlich, der Ablauf der Sezession eben der einer Sezession, dies alles auch offensichtlich nachprüfbar.

&gt;Madame, Monsieur,

&gt;Hautement motivé et capable de travailler aussi bien en équipe qu'indépendamment, je pense posséder l'expérience et les compétences que vous recherchez dans le secteur du tourisme et de l'accueil, auquel je porte un intérêt tout particulier.

&gt;Je parle couramment l'Anglais, l'Italien et le Portugais. Je possède aussi des notions d'Espagnol et j'étudie le Français, auquel je possède un très bon niveau de compréhension et n'éprouve aucune difficulté à me faire comprendre. L'attention au détail, de bonnes méthodes d'organisation ainsi que la capacité à respecter les échéances figurent parmi mes meilleures qualités qui, je le pense, correspondront à vos besoins.

&gt;Je possède la double nationalité, Italienne et Brésilienne, ce qui signifie que je peux travailler comme n'importe quel citoyen Européen. J'ai vécu deux ans et demi en Angleterre et quatre ans en Italie. Je pense que les années passées dans ces deux pays présentent un avantage puisqu'elles m'ont permis d'établir des liens avec des personnes de différents horizons et milieux sociaux.

&gt;Je comprends l'importance de la vie privée, du travail ardu et du fait de maintenir une relation professionnelle. Tous mes précédents postes ont requis du travail pratique et sans relâche. Cela demande de la patience, de la compréhension et du respect à l'égard d'autrui.

&gt;Je possède aussi un permis de conduire international, me permettant de conduire partout en Europe.

&gt; An Enabling Union should foster sustainable economic growth and job creation by stimulating (public and private) investment at both European and national level, promoting social investment and enhancing Europe’s overall competitiveness by supporting structural reforms, especially in countries that are lagging behind, while remaining on the path towards fiscal consolidation. Measures to strengthen and transform national economies implemented by Member States but supported by EU instruments – will enable Europe to realise its combined growth potential, which is in the interest of all EU countries irrespective of how well or badly they have weathered the crisis storm. ‘Smart’ investments will provide them with better tools to enhance their human capital through an active agenda focused on knowledge and skills.

&gt; A Supportive Union should enhance the EU’s ‘caring dimension’ to address concerns that the crisis has hit some countries and social groups exceptionally hard, fuelling a sense of social injustice within and between Member States. The potential measures foreseen under this pillar would send a clear signal to European citizens that efforts to reform national economies and social systems will always have to respect minimum social standards and will not lead to a ‘race to the bottom’. Instead, a social compact including social convergence criteria and more specific measures to support those suffering most from the crisis – including, for example, a complementary European unemployment scheme, an obligatory minimum support scheme or a European Mobility Fund – would flank efforts to promote Europe’s economic competitiveness.

&gt; A Participatory Union should strengthen the ties between the EU and its citizens by increasing its democratic legitimacy. The focus should not only be on traditional issues such as the powers and role of the European
Commission and Parliament, but also on expanding the opportunities for frank discussion within Member States and between citizens from different EU countries; on mechanisms to strengthen the public’s direct involvement in the EU policy debates; on ways to enhance the role of national parliaments in European policy-making at Member State level; and on expanding schemes that enable people to experience the direct benefits of EU membership and foster greater understanding of the Union.

Reading the above makes it seem like an easy win for nations like the UK, we participate in the enabling-union, which sounds very single-markety, and avoid the supporting union and participatory unions like the plague.

However... reading the details of the suggestions makes it clear that elements of eurozone economic governance exist in the former, and elements of single market access in the others, so it is far from clear that britain could avoid being ensnared in ever-closer-union...",0,1419845728,null,0,false,0,cn86wbg,t3_2qn3px,t1_cn86wbg,t3_2qn3px,null,1425168715,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

false,platypusmusic,null,null,"&gt;Koalitionsfreiheit bezeichnet das Recht von Arbeitnehmern und Arbeitgebern, sich zur Wahrung und Förderung der Arbeits- und Wirtschaftsbedingungen zusammenzuschließen. Kern dieses Rechtes – das Koalitionsrecht[1] – ist die Möglichkeit, Gewerkschaften und Arbeitgeberverbände zu gründen und sich diesen anzuschließen.

&gt;Arbeitsbedingungen sind Bedingungen, die sich auf das Arbeitsverhältnis selbst beziehen, wie z. B. Lohn, Arbeitszeiten, Kündigungsschutz usw., Wirtschaftsbedingungen haben darüber hinaus wirtschafts- und sozialpolitischen Charakter, wie z. B. Maßnahmen zur Verringerung oder Vermeidung der Arbeitslosigkeit.

&gt;Koalitionsfreiheit wird nach positiver Koalitionsfreiheit, also dem Recht, Gewerkschaften und Arbeitgeberverbänden beizutreten und der negativen Koalitionsfreiheit, also dem Recht, Gewerkschaften und Arbeitgeberverbänden fernzubleiben, unterschieden.

&gt;In Deutschland, der Schweiz, Frankreich und Italien gehört die Koalitionsfreiheit zu den verfassungsmäßig garantierten Grundrechten. Die Europäische Menschenrechtskonvention (EMRK) gewährt in Art. 11 Ziff. 1 ausdrücklich das Recht, Gewerkschaften zu bilden, ebenso der UNO-Pakt über bürgerliche und politische Rechte in Art. 22 Abs. 1. Auch die negative Koalitionsfreiheit ist durch die EMRK geschützt.[2] Auf EU-Ebene wird die Koalitionsfreiheit durch Artikel 12 Abs. 1 und Artikel 28 der EU-Grundrechtecharta geschützt.[3]

However, lightning isn't usually so damaging to pure stone buildings, so this doesn't really matter.

But *any* castle must be renovated from time to time. Otherwise it will degrade into a ruin. We have lot's of castle ruins, if you prefer that. But we also have lots of nicely renovated castles.

In Germany, we have a law called ""Denkmalschutz"", something like ""land mark protection act"". That means that an owner of a building that falls into this category cannot just renovate the way he likes. He must adhere to lots of things, e.g. that the windows are (or at least look) authentic, the right stones are used and so on.

For some people, this is a pain in the a..   but some other people like it. There are a good number of (moderately) rich people that buy an older house under Denkmalschutz and make it their hobby to renovate it in the most authentic style. They even use clay and straw, if that was originally used.

And then there are [castles like the one in Friedberg](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burg_Friedberg_%28Friedberg%29) that are just too huge for this treatment. In that castle, we have:

* a Gymnasium (german highschool, just better)
* Kreisbildstelle (where schools from the county can rend educational movies)
* part of the local tax office. This one is actually a castle-in-the-castle. This is because in Germany we have two words for castle. ""Burg"" is the military stronghold thingy, and ""Schloss"" is the representative thing. So there is a small Schloss inside the Burg.
* several houses where people live (""Burgmannenhäuser"")
* a park
* a now evangelic church, still in use (""Burgkirche"")
* a tower that you can climb (""Adolfsturm"")
* a roman bath (about 2000 years old, I didn't find an exact date)
* a well (""Georgsbrunnen"")

So, this castle is the opposite of what you asked. And yet I found it important to point it out, because usage and re-usage of a castle *is* authentic, as authentic as it can be. Even in medieval times, castles were constantly modified. When you make a tour, the guide probably say ""This are romanic Foo"" and ""This are in the style of gothic bar"" and later ""The interior was designed according to baroque style"" and so on.",0,1419846910,null,0,false,0,cn874qe,t3_2qn4t3,t1_cn874qe,t1_cn7ytoc,null,1425168606,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

Comunque, scherzi a parte, i miei commenti in questo thread sono scaturiti dal fatto che nel giro di poco tempo mi sono imbattuto in:

- un thread qui su /r/italy in cui l'OP di turno aveva aperto un thread di lamentele disprezzando l'italiano medio che si lamenta;

- seguaci di Biglino che invitavano teologi su fb a discutere con Lui, e il titolo della pagina era ""fatevi avanti, cialtroni"" e i commenti dei seguaci erano tutti estremamente poco lusinghieri nei confronti di chi non è allineato col Biglino-pensiero;

- una donna incontrata al bar che diceva che gli uomini sono tutti superficiali, stupidi e sono in tutto e per tutto inferiori alle donne;

- quest'altro thread in cui si usa di nuovo l'espressione ""italiano medio"" per disprezzare pesantemente tutti;

- vari post ""euforici"" (ma siamo su reddit, questo è normale);

- incontrato IRL un tizio appartenente a un noto moVimento che si riteneva aver capito tutto, mentre gli altri sono schiavi del sistema, quando invece non voleva ragionare e ignorava volutamente alcune cose che gli davano torto.

Quindi mi auspico che nel 2015 si possano criticare gli atteggiamenti, le idee, i comportamenti o quel cavolo che si vuole senza disprezzare le persone e senza farsi superiori agli altri, che non serve a niente, se non a creare un ambiente tossico.

Theoretically, if you encounter a rule which you don't see as rational, any behaviour should be OK, so why not jaywalk in Germany, cut in lines in the UK, stomp on money in Thailand or refuse to give up your seat to elderly people because you came first?

If you imagine a person doing all that, the first label coming to mind is ""grade-A asshole"" or similar. Disrespectful, obnoxious, unpleasant. During my travels, I try everything possible to not stick out in this way. Breaking rules to spite others **is** despicable.

*That's* the reality. And few things rub people the wrong way more than doing this rule-breaking out of spite.

Edit 2: So, the place where I jaywalk the most often is a pedestrian crossing, the traffic lights for cars there are only activated when someone presses the button. I can see the traffic lights for the intersections to the left and the right from there, but they are far away. My rationalization is, I can see perfectly well no cars are coming, so I cross without pushing the button because if I pushed the button, with the time delay, the traffic lights on either side would already be green and the pedestrian crossing red light would come on just as the cars got there, thereby inconveniencing everyone.

1- Coupe les ponts. Vraiment. Tout contact. Supprime-la des réseaux sociaux, supprime son téléphone, son mail. Note tout ça dans un document ou dans un mail que tu t'envoies et que tu archive pour ne pas l'avoir sous les yeux. Oublie le.

2- Supprime toutes les traces, autant que possible : photos, souvenirs, images facebook. J'ai tout téléchargé et mis dans une archive que j'ai stocké dans un disque dur que je n'utilise plus, ou presque. Rien sur mon tel, rien dans mon appart : l'objectif est de ne pas retomber dessus ""par hasard"".

3- Y penser, c'est normal. Ca permet d'évaluer où tu en es dans ton deuil. Trop y penser, c'est malsain, ça ne fait qu'entretenir la douleur, ce n'est pas constructif, et ça pousse à l'auto-apitoiement. Analyser la relation, oui : ça permet d'avancer et de se construire. Tourner en rond en se rappelant à quel point elle était géniale, non : elle te manque, d'accord, mais il y a plein de poisson dans l'océan.

4- Un deuil, c'est une remise à zéro. C'est dans ces périodes que tu progresse le plus : lis beaucoup, fais du sport, remet tes choix et tes croyances en question, change d'amis, d'habitudes, lance toi des défis. *Il faut apprendre à être heureux sans les autres*, sans quoi on ne peut jamais être totalement heureux avec eux.

5- De la coke et des putes. 

6- Non, je déconne pour la coke. 

7- Du sport et des filles. Une nouvelle garde robe. Un nouvel état d'esprit. De l'aventure. Des prises de risques. Devient la meilleure version de toi-même. Prends soin de toi, pour que ton esprit sache que tu mérite que tu prenne soin de toi.

8- Concentre toi sur toi, sur tes envies, tes besoins.

9- Médite : Apprends à découvrir le pourquoi de tes émotions. La pleine conscience est d'une grande aide.

10- C'est terminé pour une bonne raison. Fais une liste de ces raisons, et raccroches-y toi. Tu en auras besoin : tu ne retourne *pas* avec elle. C'est terminé, il n'y a pas de deuxième chance. Tourne la page, accepte le, et avance. Ce ne veut pas dire que ce sera plus facile, mais plus vite tu l'acceptera, plus vite ton deuil se déroulera.

Prends ton temps, laisse faire les choses : sache que, de toute façon, ça passe. Tu vas te sentir comme une merde pendant un moment, mais je te promet que ça passe, et que ça va mieux après :)

Fais des trucs qui te font vraiment plaisir, tu verra, s'occuper de soi, ça a vraiment du bon :)

Bon courage :)

No, emphatically No. This is not a situation where everything is fine and we are threatening to leave because we can't have our own way. No No No. This is a cop out argument where you just dismiss all criticism because it doesn't fit your agenda and you don't have to accept reality.

This is a crisis conceived and born out of the arrogance of the Brussels bureaucracy using **known** financial defects to shoehorn political federalisation without any remote guarantee of success. The lives of 700m ppl and the largest economic bloc in the world are subject to the experimentations of Eurocrats. Theres a quote about one death being a tragedy, a million a statistic. This is how hundreds of millions economic welfare and prospects are being treated now by Brussels. 

The European project was noble. Closer integration helped bring peace to a region. However, now thanks to the crumbled economy and failed polcies we have extremist groups on the rise, regional distrust and tension, mass unemployment, and maybe worst of all, a wasted generation, just at the point where globalisation has arrived as a force. 

Just 5 minutes ago the [Greeks headed to a third round of elections](http://www.fxstreet.com/news/forex-news/article.aspx?storyid=77588135-a8f1-4600-8887-9ee75ed1257d) in a move which could see their bailout blocked, and them head for default and possible exit from the eurozone.

This is nothing to do with whether Europe works for Britain. It's about the biggest financial/political fuck up in post war history - and not being brave enough to admit it and make the necessary reform.

The UK is fully supportive of Europe, once you are able to admit that you have a problem and want to resolve it.

**The UK LOVES Europe and the EU**. The UK is desperately fighting back the excuses to leave. 

Nobody wants to leave the EU. We want to be friends and to be part of a community, contribute to the common good, and be part of the largest economic bloc in the world...

**but** if you think we are going to hold hands with you while you jump off a bridge you need a reality check.

If Europe showed the slightest interest in reform, the UK will be the happiest nation in the world. However, its easier to dismiss us as disruptive or problematic, than listen to the cold fact that Brussels fucked up and London was right. That doesn't mean that the UK expects special treatment or our balls shampooed by servile Germans. 

We just want you to pay attention to what we say, and not focus on who is saying it.

The worst thing is that the past 5 years of 'crisis' were just a warm up. Get ready as 2015 looks like it will be very unstable.

false,VittorioD,null,null,"OPEC,, Russia, Obama e Putin possono essere legati da un'unico filo, quello del petrolio, anche se appartengono a situazioni differenti.

Che succede?

Petrolio.

In America e Canada con un prezzo del barile molto alto, oltre i 100, sono convenienti nuove tecniche estrattive, come il fracking o le tar sands. Questo comporta un aumento esponenziale dell'offerta, tanto che ***gli USA da importatori netti di petrolio passano a quasi esportatori*** (linguaggio poco tecnico, ma ti dà l'idea. Gli USA sono quelli che consumano più petrolio in assoluto). I progetti per nuovi siti di trivellazione stavano fiorendo un po' ovunque, il North Dakota ora sembra l'Arabia da quanto petrolio trivellano. 

Nel mentre.

Putin invade l'Ucraina, la parte della Crimea, che era russa finché non fu donata alla regione sovietica nella seconda parte del '900, che poi si staccò dopo la caduta del muro e divenne l'Ucraina che conosciamo oggi. L'Occidente impone sanzioni commerciali alla Russia, che quindi subisce un rallentamento dell'economia.

Poi: L'OPEC vede aumentare l'offerta a fronte di una domanda stagnante, con tratti in caduta. Panico. Si opta nella riunione di Novembre a Vienna di mantenere inalterata la produzione per tenere le quote di mercato. 

Infatti il dilemma é: prezzi o quote? Se tieni il prezzo alto, le quote diminuiscono perché entrano gli americani e i canadesi ( ma ce ne sono molti altri che fanno fracking ). Se tieni le quote alte, i prezzi diminuiscono perché fai battaglia sui prezzi. E gli OPEC sono quelli che producono a prezzi più bassi; Si parla di 5usd a barile per l'Arabia Saudita, 20 considerando i programmi sociali, per guadagnarci. Per gli americani almeno il doppio. Quindi optano, non senza resistenze (Iran in prima fila, che soffre a sua volta sanzioni per il nucleare e un'economia in recessione). L'Arabia Saudita fa da padrone. Il prezzo cala a candela.

Di nuovo in Russia.
Russia sta subendo la contrazione dell'export per le sanzioni e nel mentre si era adoperata per concludere patti con l'est per le sue risorse energetiche, che sono la stragrande maggioranza del suo export. Cala il petrolio, uno tra i suoi asset principali, calano le entrate di bilancio.

Il Cremlino fa il suo bilancio considerando, come l'IRAN, un'entrata il barile. Quindi fa: numero di barili venduti moltiplicato prezzo barile uguale tot entrate. E su quelle entrate ( anche su quelle entrate ) calibra il suo bilancio. Il barile è stato iscritto a 100usd. E il Bilancio chiudeva in deficit. Immaginati te lo scossone. 

Inoltre, con un petrolio in calo e un export fermo, l'economia scivola subito in recessione, il rublo è sotto pressione. Perde a botte del 15 per cento a seduta in borsa, e tocca la soglia psicologica di 100 sul dollaro ( 100 rubli per un dollaro ) per poi tornare a galla, prima con un rimbalzo tecnico, poi agevolato da open market della Banca Centrale Russa.

Ma ha perso lo stesso metà del valore. Questo ha fatto sì che ci fosse una fiammata di inflazione, che però gestisce male.

Per fermare l'inflazione alzi i tassi, ma se alzi i tassi strozzi l'economia che già soffoca. Che fai? La situazione si evolve in questi giorni.

L'IS si inserisce nel contesto perché un barile basso non consente ai paesi esportatori di portare avanti i programmi sociali che avevano intrapreso. Questo comporta meno finanziamenti e meno uguaglianza sociale, in Paesi in cui le disparità sono eccezionali. Questo porta malcontento ed estremismi, e in una zona come il medio oriente, una polveriera, i miliziani dello stato islamico riescono a penetrare laddove c'è malcontento. Quindi c'è grande apprensione. 


(il lato buono è che paghi meno la benzina, eh, e un sacco di cose. Cioè, i programmi sociali agli arabi, così come le loro supercar che sfoggiano a Londra e negli Emirati, il circuito di formula uno, il grattacielo nel deserto, glieli paghi tu, come glieli pagano gli occidentali)

In 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 NORWAY was at the top of the ranking. In 2011, Norway was number 2, behind Finland. 

Now HERE’s where it get’s interesting, *kiddo* - in 2012, Norway fell dramatically to FIFTH place, behind Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland.

What happened?!? Well, you see: On 22 July 2011, an angry man blew up a car bomb in Oslo and then shot a bunch of kids on an island.

If you had bothered to... you know... **look** at the chart, which you most definitely have not, you would have noticed that the total score that determines ranking is compiled from 12 factors. 2 of these factors are ""Vengeance-Seeking Group Grievance"" and ""Security Apparatus"".

Norway’s score for both of these worsened dramatically after the terror attack. A fucking terrorist certainly is a vengeance-seeker with a grievance, and the catastrophically complete and utter incompetence displayed by Norwegian police that day revealed that our security apparatus was far, far worse than had been assumed.

The dramatic worsening of *those two scores* contributed to sending Norway down on the ranking.

What you are referring to is called the international style, which in itself is a made up term used for an exhibition in the usa. This international style was heavily promoted by le Corbusier who put form over function.
The Bauhaus and das Neue Bauen were quintessentially functionalist and are not reducable to 'boxy' design.  They were philosophies of improvement of architecture for the common man, social movements that wanted to create a new, improved and functional architecture that served the people and not aesthetic appeal of the architect.
So to sum up, Bauhaus has nothing to do with the commercial contemporary architecture you're referring to. Look for example at the Neue Staatsgalerie in Berlin, the last proper Bauhaus building ever built and you see how elegant it is. Or look up Bruno Taut, one of Germany's greatest architects ever, though sadly little known.
And one last thing about the concrete, it's not at all that common during the initial phase of modernism, most houses were made from brick, as it was cheap, available and well known for its qualities. Concrete was used mostly by le Corbusier later on in his fascist phase and after the war.

Yes, the Jews were defrauding the Nazi government that was legally confiscating 100% of their assets.

The problem with any law is that both sides can abuse it. A good example are the variants of the RICO law in the US which allows assets to be confiscated from suspects **before** they are convicted. Such confiscation can and does interfere with the suspect defending themselves in court.

If there was any serious crime other than tax evasion, it was always possible to go to a Swiss cantonal court and to show evidence that someone stole their money or gained from drugs and the Swiss court would strike down the secrecy law.

I'm not, and internet communists bring this up everytime. If attempts at building communism end up being totalitarian dictatorships, it still speaks volumes about communism. If I claim that humans can fly, jump out of the window and die, would you argue that humans can still fly, it's just that my flight happened to devolve into falling down?

Also, I had to say I laughed a bit about the idea that you could ""devolve"" from Leninism. Lenin, Dzierżyński and the rest were monsters.

&gt;Yugoslavia was thriving under communism, much more than it is now.

I would be very surprised if Yugoslavia was thriving today, considering it doesn't exist, but I know what you mean. 

&gt;and the latter wasn't even true communism. 

True, I recall a guy from /r/europe raving how communism in Yugoslavia was great because his parents could afford nice vacations despite only being *middle class, and not even in the party*. So, it's not a very good example of successful communism, is it? At best, it's a ""devolution"" of communism that wasn't nearly as bad as the others until Tito held it together, then it got really bad.

&gt;The same thing could be said with current Russia, which had a better infrastructure during the Cold War and also possessed a higher education level than it does currently.

I always see that argument on /r/Russia. Russia got much worse after USSR broke up. No shit, the USSR and their eastern bloc was an empire that occupied a good part of Europe. Isn't it obvious that their standard of living would drop down when they couldn't exploit all their former client states anymore? In Poland we had a saying about this relationship with Soviet Russia: ""We give them our coal, and in exchange they take our steel.""

&gt;Catalonia

My knowledge about those events is minimal, but I was under impression that most of the success in Catalonia can be attributed to the Anarchists, and the later communist takeover by [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Negr%C3%ADn) actually helped to bring the entire state down?

&gt;On December 23, Nationalist forces launched their assault on Catalonia. By now, most Catalans were demoralized and tired of the fighting. Alienated by the Negrin government and the Communist party's nationalization of industry, the CNT was filled with defeatism and internal division. Pi Sunyer, mayor of Barcelona and a leader of the ERC, told President Azaña that ""the Catalans no longer knew why they were fighting, because of Negrín's anti-Catalan policy.""

Some new policy has to be implemented; if the southern EZ states had independent central banks, they could have devalued their currency or borrowed more, invested in infrastructure, regained competitivity, and now have returned to a more stable footing instead of stumbling from one crisis to another every year. Within the EZ, which apparently everyone in the North is in favour of, there has to be more more inter-state solidarity for it to actually function. So, yes, maybe the North does need to accept fiscal transfers, as everyone predicted would be necessary from the beginning except the politicians blindly pursuing integration.

Well the last part is a big problem. How do you fight an organization that doesn't use vioelence but connections and money? Hells Angels and other criminal organizations can be fought ""easily"" because they are violent and the actions include human trafficking and drug smugling. Maybe ""easily"" is the wrong word....it's just conventional police work. But the mafia seems to be smarter. 

If you want to fight them, you have to fight the financial and legal system on which the EU and Germany are based. Corrution and the power of money are hardwired into our society. The first one is illegal, but the boundary between ""corrution"" and ""the power / influence of money"" can be very tricky. It seems to me that what the mafia is doing in germany isn't that different to what normal companies and politcal parties do: Trying to use every loophole the law offers to make money.

The only way to use e-voting to commit voter fraud is to be present when a person votes, and confiscate their ID-card after you have verified they voted for who you told them to vote for. Doing this on any large-scale, you end up in possession of a large amount of ID cards that you shouldn't have.

false,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; And what you don't seem to realise is that austerity can - and has - cause the economy to contract faster than it causes public spending to come down.

No. What evaporated was the flow of money to these economies and with the money gone, troubled economies started to sink. There was nothing to do, but cut down public spending.

&gt; Some new policy has to be implemented; if the southern EZ states had independent central banks, they could have devalued their currency or borrowed more, invested in infrastructure, regained competitivity, and now have returned to a more stable footing instead of stumbling from one crisis to another every year. 

If the southern EZ states had their own currencies... They would have huge amounts of debt denominated in foreign currency - that is the normality with small states. With high budget deficits and increasing inflation, foreign capital would flow out of these countries, sending the foreign currency reserves in all time low while interest rates would skyrocket. As the export industries of troubled Euro countries are already working on full steam, any devaluation wouldn't actually increase current rate of exports, as there isn't room to expand them! What devaluation would do is to cut down wages and standard of living of everybody in the country, meaning a huge capital transfer from working classes to public sector, while people owning property would be saved from any cut.

The current situation isn't optimal, but at least there is much more visibility. The problem that needs to be solved in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece is how to make production grow. These economies all have too big and inefficient public sectors not to mention legislation that are prohibiting private sector from functioning properly!

&gt; Within the EZ, which apparently everyone in the North is in favour of, there has to be more more inter-state solidarity for it to actually function. So, yes, maybe the North does need to accept fiscal transfers, as everyone predicted would be necessary from the beginning except the politicians blindly pursuing integratio

Fiscal transfers based on what? If they are based on GDP/GNI then fiscal transfers would actually move money from south to east, not from north to south. If on the other hand fiscal transfers would be used to balance cyclical changes or temporary fiscal crisis, what would be the mechanism to prevent a fiscal crisis continuing for ever? You can't really expect that blank checks are written year after year just because a member state can't finance it self. It that is the logic, what is there to prevent member states from spending lavishly on social benefits and public sector?

&gt; As to your line about inflation, you realise that the US and the UK pursued the monetary policy the southern EZ states advocate and have not had rampant inflation? ... Even 20% inflation would be better than the deflation that the policies you advocate are causing. 

USA and UK are very special economies. First of all both have currencies that are considered reserve currencies - the British Pound less so. What this means is that that these countries can outsource part of their inflation to the rest of the world. Secondly both of these countries are centers of global economy, during a global recession they act as safe heavens for capital. Money withdraws from periphery and developing countries into them. Just look at the crazy amount of investment into housing in London from all around the world, that is just one example of money flowing in. 

In case of the 20% inflation, what you are suggesting is that it is better to predispose over 300 million people to high inflation than it is to have troubled countries make structural reforms to really change their economy. Hell, if that is the line you are taking, it would be much cheaper for Eurozone to just hand the Greeks money to run their public sector.

So we just print money, hand it over to member states, until we get into 2% inflation and then just stop?! And all problems were solved with that?

&gt; Germany, France and especially the UK would never accept it, so you can stop fear mongering.

Where do you think the money to bailout Greece, Cyprus, Portugal, Ireland and Spanish bank came from? It came from other member states taking more debt and debt obligations.

&gt; This is just false. There's no reason why government spending would cripple an economy. Government spending as a percentage of GDP is a bad indicator of a healthy economy.

I didn't use government spending as an indicator. In economies where the public sector uses money efficiently and where private sector produces more, the current account balance is either positive or balanced, it is possible to keep up high public spending. However when you have current account deficit, that is money flowing out of the country and fast, and inefficient public sector with private sector not producing enough. Then you are faced with an question: **is it easier to cut spending or make the spending efficient and enable the private sector to grow?**

&gt; Here's a list. You can see that the Scandinavian countries spend a lot compared to their GDP, yet they are not having economic troubles.

As someone with a decent level of understanding on all fields of economics and a pretty deep knowledge on mathematical economics, game theory and industrial organization, I have seen the field I served being raped, misinterpreted and abused by politicians, each serving his/her own retarded agenda.

On top of that, economics being an effective theory and not a science, gives the general public the false idea, that even without a formal education not only they can understand but they can also make economic propositions, which to their eyes are just as valid as those made by academics.

And the cherry on top is that because economic policy is inherently interwind with politics, it is being carried out and planned by politicians and their agendas and not by experts themselves. That means that every moron out there, with political rights, gets to indirectly affect a nation's economic policy via his/her vote. And in an era where presidents get elected on the basis of how cool they look in a televised debate that's just depressing.

To give an analogy that's like a patient having a saying on the medical procedure supposed to be performed by a medic.

Finally, one of the saddest things I have encountered in my academic life, is having to watch people who admitedly know their shit (i.e. have advanced degrees in their field), choosing to forget/ignore all the things they struggled so much to learn, just so they can serve some sort of agenda that will ensure a shit ton of money for them.

It was decreasing because there wasn't enough production to replace the aging infrastructure that was build before the Soviet annexation of the country.

Thanks to Soviet mismanagement.

Bref, j'aime bien letstalkmusic car on peut y avoir d'intéressantes discussions et le subreddit est bien modéré, mais je trouve qu'il n'est pas encore au niveau de /r/truefilm et peut s'améliorer. Je déteste /mu/ pour les raisons que tu as citées (trololol kanye west circlejerking arcade fire bleuh), mais [leur Wiki](http://4chanmusic.wikia.com/wiki/4chanmusic_Wiki) est à peu près acceptable. Rateyourmusic est indispensable pour découvrir et s'élargir à des quantités incroyables de musique et ses quelques défauts mineurs (surreprésentation du metal, overratedeness de Pink Floyd) n'enlèvent rien au fait que j'adore ce site.


Pitchfork sont bien, car ils ont un système de notation efficace et consistant et sortent des tops de fin d'année solides bien que prévisibles. J'aimerais bien trouver le même type de magasine en France pour me tenir au fait des sorties hexagonales.

&gt;And the cherry on top is that because economic policy is inherently interwind with politics, it is being carried out and planned by politicians and their agendas and not by experts themselves. That means that every moron out there, with political rights, gets to indirectly affect a nation's economic policy via his/her vote. And in an era where presidents get elected on the basis of how cool they look in a televised debate that's just depressing.

First of all, it is really important that politicians can affect politics and not only economic experts. Now, of course, politicians need experts on their side, advisors that know their shit. And they do, in functioning democracies. However your dream of a completely technocartic, math-based government is simply not viable not wanted. As you said yourself the economy is interwined with politics and there is no other way around it. Economic policy means negotiating with leaders from the economy, with your voters, with other parties, you need to wage interests, values and all sorts of thing. You can't take these things out of economic policy, a complete technocratic economic policy is simply not possible.

Economic experts want an economic policy that is only concentrated on increasing GDP growth per year, but economics is just so much more difficult than that. Maybe French people would rather have job security than a turbo economy like Germany? Do you want to take these desires out of government's economic policies?

On top of that I think it's really dangerous to have an entirely mathematical view on economics and politics, which is increasingly becoming more popular. People are inherently irrational and things like bubbles over and over again prove it. You can't take the human element out of economics, I'm sceptical towards trying to ""mathematize"" economic processes, at least, entirely.

I will let you know a secret... Britain has been very clearly communicating all this since before the Euro. 

Nobody listened, or wanted to listen. 

The subject of Europe has destroyed our political system. Would you believe that until Delors speech to the TUC in 1988, the British Left were anti-Europe, and the right - pro (which is why UKIP is able to pick up traditional Labour votes now). 

That was when Europe was about trade. However, when Europe because about political union after the Delors speech, the positions shifted. After the ERM crash, half of the British conservatives still kept faith in Europe, believing that necessary reform from inside was possible, the other half saw the madness ahead and wanted out.

This split caused still unresolved fractures in the Conservative party which allowed pro Europe Labour to win successive elections. 

I say pro Europe for a reason. The party was pro Europe, not necessarily the people. Labour was the ruling party by default, because Conservatives had so much chaos that they were unelectable. Note that despite this pro-Europe party having huge majorities, Britain still kept out the Eurozone because despite of politicians, its was seen too toxic a subject to touch. 

Only now are we starting to come full circle and see the re-emergence of the eurosceptic conservatives who have spent 15 years being ridiculed in Europe and Westminster. Cameron is very firmly in the pro EU camp. He will fight until the death to keep the UK in Europe - (maybe this is not widely realised) - but as the madness continues his own self interest will kick in.

The reason for this recent fixation on immigration I suspect is two fold. I will say openly here, I am broadly pro-immigration as in the long term its benefits outweigh the short term issues.

**Domestic**

As I explained, traditionally the British Left was anti-Europe but only came to support it when Delors signalled a shift to Big Government Europe from Free Market Europe. For left wing politicians this was great news as it meant that even if a Conservative Government came to power, an overriding socialist structure in Brussels would still be able to frame the wider scenario.

For working class Brits, it didn't change much, apart from opening up the borders but until the eastern states joined, this wasn't an issue. Then when in 2004 the situation changed with 1m+ immigration coming in from Eastern Europe under EU rules, the existing equilibrium was destroyed. 

This has been a huge issue for the working man who has seen wages driven down by a mass influx of labour who are willing to live 5-10 people to one property, and work for less wages. For a native family man with a mortgage, kids and bills, suddenly he finds his humble lifestyle close to unaffordable.

For anti-EU politicians, its an easy sell. I don't think any of them believe it really, because immigration has been great for business but it has also had a disruptive effect on working class Britain, and at the end of the day people vote, not companies, and companies know that politicians say untruths to get elected. 

**International**

Immigration is not just a UK issue. I lived in Spain for a few years and the dislike of immigration is much more brazen there than it is in the UK. I had my phone snatched once by a Roma from the coffee table when I went to the toilet and left my pregnant wife alone for a moment. When I found a policeman, the first question was ""Roma?"" People are much more open about concerns over outsiders... Maybe its good to be honest, but I feel that UK is extremely moderate in comparison. 

In Paris, when you step off the Eurostar to get on the metro at Gare de Nord, the first thing I am met with are gangs of Roma by the ticket machines. Walk around some central areas and you have whole families lying down on cardboard next to an ATM begging. As we all know, the French are not shy about these issues and thats why Le Pen is doing so well. 

Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden etc etc etc the same issues exist. I am not sympathising or agreeing, but if you ignore issues, it pushes reasonable people to the extreme. My view is that the Roma begging gangs are an inconvenience and mass immigration is a long term benefit, especially considering pension issues and low birth rates. 

Europe is not collapsing because of Roma beggars. It is collapsing because of the euro.

However, we get back to why the UK is so focused on Immigration. 

It's an issue which the politicians can put in their teeth and make a movement with. It gets the support at home, and gets them support with big groups of second and third parties across Europe, who may soon be in the next coalition Governments across Europe.

Before, the UK's calls for wide ranging reform have been ignored, but immigration is a popular subject across the region and serves the purpose of starting the conversation of reform. 

Right now, the UK is just ignored, and told to sign cheques, but otherwise fuck off and sit in the corner.

**What should be fixed?**

Step back from this idea of federalisation, slash the Bureaucracy, continue bolster the free market and free trade agreements - you know, just the usual stuff.

I wasn't speaking about fraud, but eavesdropping - which has been made trivially simple. Literally any application, without needing special administrative rights, can log ballots cast on that computer. You have to trust not only the electoral committee, but also Microsoft, Apple, Skype, Mozilla, Google, Logitech, that no-name AVI to MP4 converter you used only once, and every USB dongle you've ever connected - and even [Sony CDs you've played](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal). Do you honestly trust the developers of, say, uTorrent to be law-abiding citizens who would not exchange your privacy for money?

Mind you, such piece of eavesdropping software is close to impossible to find and identify. So you find a piece of code that waits for a certain window to appear, with certain size, with a certain window title SHA-1 [hash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) (to avoid naming it in the program), and with a certain shade of green pixel at x=10, y=50 window location. Then it takes a screenshot of certain areas inside that window, OCRs it, and sometime later sends three encrypted integer values (carrying person's ID, district, candidate) to a remote location, possibly hiding that in update check request or any other normal traffic. How does this information lead you to believe that it is an attack on the voting application? There is no information to reveal it.

At best, you find the malware, report it to central databases for anti-virus software to scan and remove, but you won't find out what it did unless you explicitly test it against the voting application - which I doubt Symantec, Kaspersky and others are doing with every malware they find.

This is an extremely lucrative way for large-scale mapping of population's political preferences (voting process reveals voter's name, sex, age, district, preference), in unprecedented precision, by an outsider without any inside knowledge or cooperation.

They *are* dishonest to their electorate (although not more so than their predecessors or any other mainstream European party for that matter). If they were honest, they would say ""You know what, we can try re-negotiating but it's going to be risky and will cause lots of problems and may eventually lead to a national currency. You want that or do you want austerity forever?"". 

After they're elected, they'll have to either fall back on their promise to ""seriously re-negotiate the bailout terms"" or fall back on their promise ""to not cause any problems to the economy and never undermine the country's membership to the euro"". 

&gt; And where will people turn then? 

That's an interesting question. A ""material conditions"" reading of the story will lead one to think that since the economy will keep deteriorating, another anti-bailout party will pop up and become popular and eventually after a series of them one is going to be honest/radical enough to go through with their promises. By that time, either the Eurozone will have reformed itself or Greece will just exit the monetary union. But an interesting alternative view is that the economy will remain shit but people will get used to it and it will become the new status quo.

* Berliners are also famously rude. However, it's not meant to insult you: on the contrary, it's a kind of wit. There is an *art* to being properly rude the Berlin way.
* Germans maintain eye contact for slightly longer than Anglo-Saxon cultures do. This may make you think they're staring at you all the time.
* Try to develop an interest in history. Berlin is full of some of the coolest history on the planet.
* There are a lot of rules and regulations, but they're mostly common sense, and/or based on respect for other people's needs (e.g. don't be noisy after 10 pm).

Maybe French people would rather have job security than a turbo economy like Germany? Do you want to take these desires out of government's economic policies?

The best job security is when there is more demand than supply. If you have an economy that doesn't grow or economy that is decreasing, it doesn't matter a single cent what the legislation says about your labor rights: at the point where the company you were working goes bust, you are out of job.

And let me also add one thing: Germany doesn't have turbo economy. The German GDP growth has been anemic, yes it has done better than most other Eurozone economies, but the troubles are just ahead of it. The illusion of Germany doing well is caused largely by work force decreasing faster than it is naturally replenished, thus causing more demand. However the people who have just left the work force are just in the beginning of their path, more money will be used to pay their pensions and health care.

While this is true, we have fortunately known for a long time the full aspect of several branches of various theories. Yes, there is not a single theory that offers an immediate remedy to every country's problem. However, you don't need a PhD to understand simple macroeconomics, which in the case of Greece, seemed to be the case.

If you take a hard look at various fiscal and monetary measures in Greece over the past decades, within the context in which they happened, you will want to pull your hair out. Yes, the retardation was this high over here.

You have to realize that my idea on politics is the product of me having spent most of my life in Greece. And if you haven't lived here, trust me, you don't know the half of it.

Also, true story :

As an MSc student I tried to collect data for a paper on interest rates on housing loans issued by privately owned greek banks. The National Statistic Agency flat out refused to give me data going further back than 2007... I filed a request at the Ministry of Economics, asking to force them to give me the data, since there was no legal reason why I shouldn't have access to that data. 

My request is still being ""reviewed"" after 5 years... 

edit : Yes, you should always account for non quantitative elements in an economic analysis. Which you then try to mathematically express. While all agents irl are not rational, this is also accounted for by either ""nearly perfectly rationality"" or ""equal expected average irrationality"" for all agents. While I'm no expert in macroeconomics, I can tell that there are several papers out there addressing the issues on the lack of perfect rationality in various models. [example](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~akerlof/docs/inflatn-employm.pdf)

1. Die Musik von Kraftwerk ist als doppelter Transfer zu verstehen: Es wird sowohl ein Bild
deutscher Kultur und Identität vermittelt, als auch ein nachhaltiger, transnational wirkender
Einfluss auf die Entwicklung populärer Musik ausgeübt.
2. Kraftwerk selbst als Beispiel für Hybridisierung: Ihr Spiel mit deutscher Identität in Form
von 20-minütigen Stücken mit deutschen Texten tritt zurück zugunsten eher typischer Pop-
Muster und einer kosmopolitischen Perspektive (mehr und kürzere Songs, Bilingualität).
3. Die Entstehung von Krautrock und insbesondere Kraftwerk ist das Ergebnis der spezifischen
historischen Situation in der BRD.
4. Kraftwerks Auftreten ist ein Beispiel für ethnic performance (vgl. Möhring): Sie spiegelten
ihrem Publikum dessen Erwartungen des 'typisch Deutschen'.

* ""Autobahn"" von Kraftwerk als stereotypes Bild / Klischee der deutschen Kultur (in den 70ern)

* Zuschreibungen von nationalen Identitäten sind nur fehlerbehaftete Konstrukte

* ""Nation"" oder ""Volk"" als konstruierte Konzepte, Sinn = Bildung einer Nation/Identität (im deutschen Fall)

* Beide beruhen auf Konzepten, Mythen, Vorstellungen und (verzerrter?) Selbstwahrnehmung und adaptierten Idealen (gerne auch aus anderen Kulturkreisen)

* Einfluss der Nationalsozialistischen Ideologie ist nicht von der Hand zu weisen

* Kraftwerk spielten mit der Aufladung des Begriffes, mit seinen Nazi-Verbindungen, im modernen Kontext

* Laut eigener Aussage u.a. französische, rumänische (?), russische Einflüsse auf Kraftwerk

* Musik als Persiflage auf Volksmusik/volkstümliche/nationale Musik bzw. deutsche Identität (und sei es die im Ausland so Wahrgenommene)

false,Zwemvest,NETH,The Netherlands,"No, I am not. But for one; the monarchy isn't poor, they don't NEED those pensions. The monarchy is actually one of the richest royal families in Europe. But they cede(d) most of their personal profits to the state, in return for some simple pensions. Now, I agree that these pensions could be toned down a little, but the argument that the monarchy should be absolved purely because they cost too much is nonsense; it'd cost us FAR more to absolve the monarchy.

Second, a lot of millionairs and billionairs are born into their wealth. The American Dream doesn't exist, most millionairs aren't self-made. These people and their companies have the wealth and resources to lobby to their goverment. No matter how you twist the ""companies-control-the-goverment"" conspiracy theory, you've GOT to admit that companies have influence in the goverment. So there is no reason to go after the monarchy specifically for tax payer money; the same could be said about the Royal Dutch Shell, who lobbies to keep tax rates for companies low. The money the monarchy receives is just a lot more direct. I agree though; it's not a fair system. Capitalism favors the rich and the old, not the hardworking and the creative (as it should do).

I will try my best not to react because despite your lack of maturity in this conversation I am above your level of discourse and you are only proving yourself the childish one here

and why would you want to deter me from being interested in politics when it's abundantly clear western capitalism is failing  hard and the only people who want to keep it going are the spoiled baby boomer generation who need to collect their pensions still while they throw the debts and unemployment on their children.

the truth is the capitalist economy collapsed in 2008 and had to bee rescued, every time someone says this the only phrase that comes to mind is ""too big to fail"", I don't trust an economy that's not actually capitalist anymore, to be more extreme the marriage of the state and business is often called ""fascism"", I don't believe we are there yet but it's very close. 

level with me here though becasue I was very close to just not bothering to reply, are you here to simply defend the US or actually have a real conversation about what it means to be a secure nation, Financial freedom is one of the most important aspects of this since money and debt pretty much equal slavery- 

When replying think to yourself, does the capitalist economy in general rely on ever increasing GDP and growth otherwise face a situation where it will roll over on it's debts? is this infinite growth model sustainable forever in a world of finite recurses et  cetera as I just don't enjoy these conversations that turn into a shitting contest, I can say that the bond buying and QE measures have worked to stabilize the US economy since 2008, it has had the same effect as devaluing the currency to cover the bad debts, the money created has been used by companies to back stocks and pump the dow back to new highs, bond yields have lowered thanks to all the money piling in there and you are right those bonds are actually yielding negative now becasue it's not a true market and real actors like China have stopped buying them. 

My problem as I see it is, this is all from debt created at 0% interest, what happens when interest rates rise again? won't that lead to people getting out of these assets due to the fact they are not profitable, interest rates have not risen since 2008, isn't that a new precedent? at the very least you have to agree we are in unchartered territory here.

But I think the working class voter should also be told that if jobs wouldn't be taken there by immigrants, they might go to China, India or Latin America and so would the tax money. This is a problem that the US had...pretty much all its history, which is why they are now made of Germans, Irish, Scandinavians, Italians, French and so on...who also immigrated and took local jobs. But now they are the most developed country (or among the top), have a recovering economy and leads pretty much the world. 

So if the worker is also aware that when countries of origin of these immigrants, ""shielded"" by the EU from outside negative influence, like civil wars, dictatorships, russian expansionism; so if these workers get more money, have a good economy and are friendly, they will also buy more...products. 

The example with 1 million immigrants from Poland is good. The tragedy is that on this continent, as a result of years of wars and isolation, 1 million people have to leave their country to work for nothing in other countries just to make a living. But now the economy is going well, and their are going back home. Britain does trade with Poland, without bureaucracy, and Poland is not much of a problem now. Similarly, there are two countries left, Romania and Bulgaria. So east immigration to west, within the EU, is good for both. Also, the crisis did not start because of east Europe. It started because of poor monitoring of credit...because the EU does not have the power to intervene directly in national politics. And east Europe is the exact result of a divided continent, at war (or argument) daily.

The Roma issue does seem to be a problem. And it is in many countries including Romania, Bulgaria or Hungary which all are countries with large numbers of Roma. But the actual issue is that the problem is shoved under the carpet and not discussed about. The immigrants from India, the Roma, are now a European nation essentially. They have their own social rules, language, culture and history that almost all share...but they are the pariah. Blacks in America also went through a similar phase. But now the president is black. So change can be done...

""Step back from this idea of federalisation, slash the Bureaucracy, continue bolster the free market and free trade agreements - you know, just the usual stuff."". But the question is...didn't this start the crisis? Free market and trade without rules? Wouldn't a federal state be able to apply economic reform in greece, without going through a second layer of bureaucracy? Or wouldn't the same federal government, be able to make Romania apply laws must bolder, and educate it's own citizens of Roma origin, without going to a slow adapting mindset of this former communist country?

The idea of federalism might actually slash the bureaucracy. Same law everywhere, and if one state fails, the other pick it up, and it will then pick up others. Much of what is happening today...but having to go through the pain of having the Greek government mess things up, while both citizens in Europe and in Greece have had enough of the same problem.

For the UK, if anything, it's ""moral"" duty to contribute, right now, is not with money or by leaving, but by simply promoting the same view that made it recover, in the rest of Europe. I'm sure a Europe where 80% of its countries are on the plus, is very very profitable for the UK.

Are we? I thought I was replying to this message... *""If Podemos wins the next spanish election, we might see a surge in similar parties across the continent. And then finally some EU reform.""*

So what are these EU reforms? That is a valid question...

Okey, lets look at Syriza and their suggested policies. The central theme of their solution to the crisis is restructuring/forgiving debt. The problem with this is that currently the major holders of Greek debts are the other EU member states and the ECB. From these two, the only one who can do cut down of debt is the ECB as they have bought Greek debt from the market with cents. However ECB making the restructuring of the debt isn't enough. Other EU member states would need to make the cut also, meaning that they just ended up paying part of Greeks debts. That is a political suicide!

But lets pretend that ECB cuts down debt, other Eurozone states give Greece 50 years to pay their current debts with 0% interests. What then? There would be no additional loans coming from the EU and other Eurozone states, the Greek state would need to function only with income it gets from taxes. Is the Greek state really up to that?

&gt; I am not that interested in reformist EU/EP-level politics so I cannot answer your question properly.

The Russian rule actually wasn't that bad. We are speaking of imperial Russia, a different state from modern Russia or the Soviet Union. Under the Russian rule Finland was quite autonomous, with own currency, own constitution, own border control, own post office, and for example the Finnish language gained official position. The autonomity was such extent that Finns commonly viewed it as a personal union, two monarchies with a common monarch, not that Finland was a part of the state of Russia.

I am still worried that the difference in legislature from the EU and its member states (much more liberal laws than there would ever be in the national parliaments - for most of them at least) will give a huge rise to the far right. Especially because they often are the only one's who talk about it (not that they would tell truth, but who cares about that if the other side just sits there and says nothing).
European politics have to be implemented into everyday coverage/life of the citizens. But for that to happen, national parties have to be interested in making them national topics. There are a few solutions, but I do not feel like I can help much there.

With that we have to do everything to stop european elections from being sub-important to a lot of citizens but I feel thats mostly because national parties never talk about their EU policies ...

I mean there are so many questions .. Does the EU still have a democratic deficit ? It certainly changed in the last years and became much better.
Do we want to create a ""european"" culture for a ""european"" people ? I think we do, but nobody wants to talk about it. In my country I also have different cultures from my local part of the country, and the country itself. Why shouldnt there be another european layer on top ?
There are so many options. Make a ""citizen"" subject in school where half of it is your country, the other half is the european union. Without political education there is not much to be expected here ...

The fact that you even *have* a feminist political party that got 200 THOUSAND votes is *insane*. I am very happy for you that those raving lunatics did not get into parliament. But the fact that they almost had a chance is creepy.

&gt;I think it's funny how some people seem to think that it's forbidden to talk about immigration and that it's a bad thing, but simultaneously want to curb discussions about gender roles. Don't you see the irony in that?

Stating that virulent hatred of men is a bad thing is not equal to curbing ""discussions about gender roles"". 

&gt;Meanwhile, most Swedes can comfortably discuss both immigration and gender roles. Maybe you should spend more time talking with Swedes instead of painting this bizarre picture of Sweden in your mind. How about that?

Only today I found out after years of being bombarded ""Ireland must pay it's debts"" Ireland is one of only (off the top of my head) three European states NOT to default on debt, Finland, Norway and I think Switzerland being the third. 

I don't see people shunning German bonds anymore so this whole ""nobody will ever trust us again"" thing is a total lie.

anyway I'm off point, I love that the left is making tracks in Ireland but sein fein in its current form is only a populist faux left party in reality but at least a move in the correct direction. 

the problem with the movement like this is it needs to be uniform across many countries in europe, if Greece elects Syriza  on their own and the rest of europe stays in the centre right the capitalist boys club will simply stop investing in Greece altogether ""becasue those guys are crazy"" and then point saying ""look at those leftist policys running the economy""

unfortunately that is the realpolitik behind the scenes however if it becomes a movement then it has sticking power to achieve things.

I really do home sein fein do come to power in the next election although I will be voting socialist but they better not fuck it up with debt based spending and populist policy's. building a country takes hard decisions that the public can empathize with.

That depends very much on what your nationalist priorities. Ukraine is not and cannot be one-nation-one-country country because you have half population that speaks Ukrainian and half population that speaks Russian, one part of the population are Catholics, another Unionists and Orthodox  schism, and Russian Orthodox Christians, also Jew and Muslim minorities.

If you support **civic nationalism** otherwise known as patriotism - then I can respect that. But to enforce civic nationalism you have to guarantee the rights of all citizens, and by that you have to give national status to Russian language and ensure the safety of Russian Orthodox Churches.  Then by all means build your own country. 

But if you try to make Ukraine country only for Ukrainians and Catholic Unionists - then as Russian nationalist and patriot my way would be make everything possible to protect Russian-speaking population in your country.

Déjà dans l'ouvrage ""Les discriminations entre les femmes et les hommes"" sous la direction de  Françoise Milewski et de Hélène Périvier (2011), tu y trouveras beaucoup de chiffres détaillés sur le question et des explications très détaillées des mécanismes (notamment le très fameux ""plafond de verre"" pour les femmes cadres).
Dans l'ouvrage, tu trouveras que l'écart entre les femmes qui n'ont pas arrêté leurs carrières et les hommes est de 17%. Ce qui invalide tout de suite l'argument, ""c'est parce qu'elles prennent des congés maternité"". Que nenni !
Tu peux aussi sonder la littérature scientifique sur le sujet en Français qui est déjà assez conséquente rien qu'avec google scholar:
http://scholar.google.fr/scholar?hl=fr&amp;oe=ASCII&amp;as_sdt=0,5&amp;q=discriminations+salariales+femme+homme

L'article de wikipédia est pas mal aussi:
https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/In%C3%A9galit%C3%A9s_de_revenus_salariaux_entre_hommes_et_femmes
Il renvoie à un étude d'Olivier Thévenon (OCDE) que tu peux consulter en détail et qui montre même un accroissement des inégalités salariales femme/homme.

Autre précision importante: l'écart est hétéroscédastique. Il augmente au fur et à mesure que l'on grimpe dans la hiérarchie des salaires. 
Il y a un article très intéressant de the atlantic qui est paru récemment sur le sujet:
http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/12/the-sticky-floor-why-the-gender-wage-gap-is-lowest-for-the-worst-paying-jobs/383863/
Entre deux smicards, la discrimination salariale de genre est faible voir nulle (les deux reçoivent le smic). Par contre entre de hauts cadres, on va détecter des écarts très importants. Les femmes qui sont conseillers pour les finances personnelles aux USA ne gagnent que 58,6% en moyenne du revenu de leurs collègues masculins.

And all the good this has done Greece is have it drop from a ""developed country"" status to an ""emerging market"" status. 

I'd humbly suggest when your country is no longer considered a ""developed country"" that perhaps instead of burning piles of money to try and create wealth (which is essentially what austerity is) to change course and look at your next options.

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;STATISTICALLY MOST of our Russian speakers are ""RUSSIFIED"" ethnic Ukrainians.

That's untrue. Your error comes from the assumption that those who were called 'malorossi' spoke modern Ukrainian. While the languages they spoke could be considered dialects of Eastern Slavonic - Ukrainian wasn't defined from all of then but just the Western dialects spoken from Kiev to Lwow.

After the Ukrainization process began in the 20's under the Communists - those who lived in the East and South of the country were faced with unknown language that wasn't their own tongue, but something as far from Russian and Ukrainian. Similar how the [Rusyns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusyns) never adopted Ukrainian but kept their own language.

In the 30's after multiple protests they were given choise between Ukrainian and Russian language - and most of them choose Russian both for education of their children and for administrative tramitation. The reason of that is because in some regions Odessa, Donbass, Luhansk - the majority were always Russian-speakers and in other South-Eastern regions  there were significant Russian-speaking minority. So that population already knew Russian language and between something known and unknown and foreign - choose Russian.

So your statement while not completly false - is incomplete. 

&gt;Come fight us, pussy. I say this as a person of Russian/Polish noble descent, an avowed anti-theist: come fucking fight us you subhuman katsap; you don't know shit about what our Nationalism stands for. We spit on that ultra-conservative Svoboda party platform; our enemy is the Kremlin and its katsap supporters like yourself, not people who live within our borders.

You are aware that with your words you are acting as anti-Ukrainian propogandist. One of those provocateurs who that claims to be on one side but at the same time shows the worst traits of that side that even the best propaganda wouldn't be able to point out?

&gt;Not a single one. The philosophical and structural foundations are completely different.

So it is different, not because you want to execute people for their opinions, but because the opinion you want to execute for is different?

false,Krawall2,null,null,"Du hast völlig Recht. Das Gesamtland kann sich da arschverletzt fühlen und dumm rum blubbern, ändern tut das nichts daran, dass dort eine Sezession stattgefunden hat, die dem Selbstbestimmungsrecht der Völker entspricht.

Das ist ja auch das Problem der Verschwörungstheoretiker, die von einer Annexion sprechen. Rechtlich ist das nämlich nur eine, wenn die Russen dort ihr Militär hingeschickt hätten um die Bevölkerung dazu zu zwingen sich bei der Wahl für eine Abspaltung zu entscheiden bzw. diese Abspaltung einseitig vollzogen hätten. 

Da beides nicht der Fall war, wird versucht allein den Fakt das russische Truppen vor Ort waren als Grund für eine Annexion zu verkaufen, was nicht nur dumm ist, sondern der eigenen Argumentation aus früheren Zeiten entgegen steht. Weiterhin wird behauptet, dass es sich ja wegen der Angliederung an Russland um eine Annexion handeln muss, schließlich verlor die Ukraine Land und Russland bekam es. Dumm nur, dass ein eigenständiger Staat, und dies war die Krim nach der erfolgreichen Sezession, einem anderen Staat jederzeit beitreten kann. Dies ist auch geschehen, dies ist so auch vertraglich fest gehalten. Jedes erdenkliche Argument der Verschwörungstheoretiker kollidiert ganz klar mit der Faktenlage, aber irgendwie stört die das nicht.

Auch die auf die Sezession folgenden Abläufe zeigen deutlich, warum die Russen dort Blutvergießen und Krieg verhindert haben. Hätten die dort nämlich nicht eingegriffen, wäre auf der Krim das selbe wie in der Ostukraine passiert. Eine faschistische Militärjunta die ihr eigenes Volk bombardiert. 

Um noch mal was zu deiner Regierung und der Verfassung zu sagen, auf der du ja auch gerne rumreitest:

Die Regierung der Ukraine ist illegitm, sie ist es genau genommen bis heute. Bei dem faschistischen Putsch wurde die nötige Mehrheit zur Absetzung des ehemaligen Präsidenten verfehlt, trotz Oktopusvoting, ausschließen der kommunistischen Partei von der Abstimmung und bewaffneten Faschisten im Saal. 

Damit war alles was danach als Regierung verkauft und durch den Westen unterstützt wurde schlicht verfassungswidrig. Gegen so eine Regierung ist Widerstand nicht nur rechtlich korrekt sondern sogar geboten. Dass in diesem Klima ein Landesteil sich abspaltet dürfte selbst dem dümmsten einleuchten.

false,Mnyx,FRAN,France,"A factor you doesn't take into account is that more democracy might imply less integration. Take the constitutional treaty for example, it was a failure in France because it was too liberal and it was a failure in the Netherlands because it was deemed not enough liberal. Peoples of Europe are slightly different. In order to pass it, democracy was bypassed and the Lisbon treaty which is a lighter version was adopted without votation in most major countries (I think Ireland had a referendum, beside that, I'm not sure).


Economy aside, a simple rule is that you can't have expansion and integration at the same time, that's why the UK needs to leave the EU. If you want a federal union, that's the best decision that could be made right now. Military wise, the european union already have an army, and it's NATO, in the treaties it's clear than the EU must not step on NATO's shoes, but it could reform itself once UK is out of the picture, as it is a country that will NOT push for military integration and support the US agenda.


Also more integration would mean more legitimacy, and that leads to two things: transfer of powers, and those powers should rest in the hands of elected people. Europe so far has been a great invention to strip powers from the national level to subnational levels and suprational levels; something which I think is a huge mistake, I believe in a Europe of nation-states, but the flair says it all. To whom do you transfer those powers ? There are no european elected governement, and I don't like the idea of a stronger subnational federalism/regionalism/autonomies, whatever.


Now the big problem is legitimacy. The fundamental element of legitimacy in my country is the abstract notion of nation that expresses itself through concrete elements, everything derives from it. If you kill it, what do you replace it with ? Another european nation ? I don't think Europe is culturally ready for that. I don't believe in any post-national thought either. 


The fact is, when we look at the past, we've made steady progress but the road ahead is gonna be bumpy. The euro was a half-success, Britain will halt any advance in the fiscal and financiary reforms that are needed to progress. Certain people here will say that cutting Britain out of the EU would be like cutting its own leg, but what is a leg worth if it doesn't want to move forward ?

The Republika Srpska police, after the release, came out saying that the tape was ""mounted"", probably meaning ""manipulated"", only to come out a few days later, after request for the release of the documents on the forensic analysis, to say that ""it doesn't matter whether the forensic analysis was conducted,"" leading many to believe that the analysis has, indeed, never been done, and they were just perpetuating the party policy, which pretty normal in a heavily corrupt *de facto* particracy.

This comes after the SNSD-led (Cvijanović's party) coalition won the election in November in RS. They have a two seat majority, and the two MPs who were allegedly being discussed about in alleged Cvijanović tape — labeled ""papci"" (pl. of ""papak"" - ""hoof""), which is how the woman on the tape called MPs they ""bought"" — left the opposition led coalition to become ""independents"" and sided with the SNSD-coalition in electing the Cvijanović as the mandator for suggesting the Ministers to the Assembly, thus giving SNSD technically a four-seat majority in the Assembly.

To add to that some comedy and Balkanic intrigue — one of the MPs that left the opposition after being elected as their candidate to become independent, in the beginning of this year left the party from the SNSD-led coalition to join the opposition, with SNSD-led coalition accusing him of treachery and being bribed.

The media situation in Republika Srpska? Biggest TV stations are:

* RTRS - state (i.e. entity) TV, which is basically ruling party's political outlet, since the board of directors is named by the Assembly,

* BN - opposition channel

* ATV - more-or-less unbiased, but often leans towards regime.

Of course, there exists media freedoms from the legal standpoint, major Bosnian channels are accessible to anyone and a lot of foreign channels are accessible to anyone with cable (AlJazeera Balkans and N1, CNN subsidiary, being the local newcomers).

Biggest papers:

* Glas Srpske - SNSD's Rodong Sinmun, definitely the biggest newspaper in RS,

* Nezavisne, Glas's biggest competitor, written in Latin, unlike the Cyrillic Glas, is somewhat pro-Bosnian, unlike Glas and SNSD, takes up a much smaller share of the market — both Glas and Nezavisne (meaning, quite ironically, ""Independent"") are owned by the same man, Željko Kopanja, and the previous editor of Nezavisne is now the editor of Glas. She is the daughter of SNSD cadre, Nebojsa Radmanovic, previous Serb member of the tripartate Bosnian presidency.

* Press RS — pretty much pro-SNSD tabloid.

The situation in Bosnian print is better, however, with outlets such as Slobodna Bosna and Oslobodjenje being decent examples of journalism and both are accessible in RS, just as any foreign media outlet that can find someone its audience.

The biggest freedom is, of course, on the Internet — since its the cheapest.

The political context — SNSD has been in power in RS for quite some time now, and when they're not in power, the opposition is. The difference between the regime and the opposition — they're both shit, however the shit in power always stinks the loudest.",0,1419866288,null,0,1419866657,0,cn8bvtz,t3_2qppb0,t1_cn8bvtz,t3_2qppb0,null,1425166362,57,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,57

&gt;The devaluation will lead to ""burning piles of money"" since it will hold less and less value. 

Actually on the contrary. Because southern europes productivity is less than that of Northen Europe you essentially have the Germans and Dutch exporting at the same price to Greeks because it's all in the same currency. This means when a Greek or Italian goes to buy a product they won't particularly favour their nationalities products or a product from spain/portugal/italy or Greece because the trade is done in the same currency making the same product produced more productively in Germany priced at a cheaper rate. 

If the Greeks had to devalue their currency against the Euro those German exports would no longer hold their values which would cause a shift for the Greeks to stop purchasing northern european goods and instead pump money into local manufacturing which would then provide jobs for Greeks and in turn allow them to purchase even more locally Greek made products (as northern european goods would now be considered too expensive). This is also has the effect of devaluing Greek exports to Northern Europe which now makes Greek products cheaper than German/Dutch products in Germany and Holland making Greek products more attractive than Dutch/German products which would also boost manufacturing and Greek exports. 

In fact this German/Northern Europe export policy has caused for the US treasury to accuse Germany of exporting poverty to the eurozone as well as globally

The point of my post was to say that it is very easy to confuse the media and politicial consensus (the extreme political correctnes) with the real opinion of the Swedish people. Seven of our eight political parties promote mass immigration and the feminist agenda, but you wouldn't find 7/8 normal Swedes who promote it.

The tables have finally started to turn however and more and more people are opposing these destructive ideologies as the real consequences of them are starting to show.

Swedes, Danes and Norwegians have been similar culturally for centuries. Of course we still are, even though our media and politicians don't want us to be. So don't read too much into what our politicians and media are saying because in reality we don't support mass immigration and crazy feminists much more than you do.

You should use Sweden as an example for how much you can ruin your society by letting cultural marxists set the agenda. It is shameful to admit but the Swedish people have been very naive and we've put too much trust in our politicians for a long time. Now we are paying the price for it.

Die FLugzeuge waren nicht echt? Ein weiteres Gebäude ist eingestürzt, obwohl kein Flugzeug es getroffen hat? Seltsam, schauen wir uns doch mal ein paar Videos an. 

Ich erinnere mich, wie es sich langsam alles zusammenfügte, ich suchte Foren, in denen solche Themen diskutiert wurden, ich versuchte selber Fragen zu stellen. Jedoch immer noch mit ein bisschen Skepsis, es erschien so unglaublich. 

Eine Zeit lang ging ich in die Schule und dachte mir, scheiße, checken die nicht was hier abgeht? Das draußen die ganze Welt gelenkt wird von irgendwelchen nicht greifbaren Mächten. Ich hab mich wirklich hilflos gefühlt. Hab danach immer mehr Verschwörungen gesucht. Irgendwann bin ich glaube ich mal auf einen richtig guten Beitrag gestoßen, als auf irgendwas seltsames bei 9/11 hingewiesen hatte. Und irgendjemand nahm sich die Zeit und erklärte mir es. 

Seitdem sah ich es nicht mehr so engstirnig, informierte mich über die anderen angeblichen Verschwörungen und merkte, wie dumm ich irgendwelchen Leuten nachgelaufen bin. 

Hab mich aber immer für diese Themen interessiert, war dann auch sehr lange auf conspiracy unterwegs, oh man das war ne Zeit.

Der Punkt, an dem ich merkte, das die Welt viel zu komplex und unvorhersehbar ist, als das eine Macht dahinter steht, war irgendwie befreiend.

This could be an extremely positive lifechanging experience for you.
As a german I would like to give you some advice about Berlin and Germany in general.

1) First of all, don't be afraid. We're not that mucht different from you.

2) Language is the key. At first German seems much more complicated than English and a little bit overwhelming. But it has a certain ""logic"" to it. No one will ridicule you for not speaking it perfectly. When it comes to foreigners speaking our language we are very kind and almost flattered.
But even without German you can communicate pretty effectively, especially in places like Berlin.

3) If possible visit a ""Gymnasium"". It is the highest schoolform in the German 3-legged educational system and has the most similarities to high schools. Unfortunately I don' know much about Australian high schools. But if compared to American ones it is a bit more challenging and can seem a bit overwhelming as well. But eventually you can get an ""Abitur"". It's a degree that lets you study tuition free at every German University.

4) Germans can seem a bit reserved at first sight. But it is more a sign of proper manners and respect. For some in Germany friendship is a serious thing. We don't want to annoy or invade your ""space"" to soon. But as already said, if you make friends, it probably can last a lifetime.

5) Germans can be pretty direct. At first it can seem a bit offensive. But once again it's just the way a lot of us were brought up. As much as  Germans love friendliness and openess, we love honesty and integrity.

6) Berlin is awesome! This is the place to be in Germany and maybe Europe. It's a vibrant city and maybe the coolest on the planet. It's hard to describe Berlin you have to feel, hear and smell it.

&gt;Because southern europes productivity is less than that of Northen Europe you essentially have the Germans and Dutch exporting at the same price to Greeks because it's all in the same currency.

Ermm not exactly. Maybe the Dutch or German prices are lower because they are more efficient at producing a good . Furthermore even though demand does depend on price, what needs to be calculated is elasticity. Maybe Greek consumers won't buy local products even though they might be cheaper. 

Moreover greek products depend on some foreign imports in order to be produced (oil, coal, flour anything). So if Greece devalues its currency by 10% the products will not be 10% cheaper but ~8% cheaper, meaning the devaluation could be unecessary.

Furthermore, Greece devalued its currency several times in the past without success, therefore what makes you think that it would be a success this time?

The point of my comment was not try and excuse these acts. It was merely to claim that calling the UK an enemy nation as it spies on you is ridiculous given the context of how almost every other Western nation participates in similar activity. Arguably they're positively bound to. The point of a government is to fulfill the needs of its electorate and if these needs are best served by spying to, for example,  gain an advantage in trade negotiations or access useful information on geopolitical threats it would otherwise not have (due to lack of intelligence sharing) arguably it should do so.

Le problème est que tu fais des comparaisons ""ceteris paribus"" dans un monde où tout est inégal.
Lis ce que j'ai écrit.
Entre une femme sans arrêt pour congé maternité et un homme, on a 17% d'écart de salaire (cf ""Les discriminations entre les femmes et les hommes"" sous la direction de Françoise Milewski et de Hélène Périvier (2011)).

En plus, tu tronques complètement les chiffres de l'étude que tu cites.
Je suppose que tu parles de l'étude de l'observatoire des inégalités présente dans wikipédia vu les chiffres que tu évoques. D'ailleurs, je ne t'avais même pas parlé de cette étude là mais de celle d'Olivier Thévenon pour l'OCDE.
La seule étude que tu lis, tu n'es même pas capable de la citer correctement. A poste et expérience équivalents, on a un écart de 9%. Et après, tu dis que ça ne fait pas mention des choix de carrière? Ce qui n'est pas du tout négligeable!
Une femme ingénieure gagnera moins qu'un homme ingénieur par exemple.
Au passage, l'article de the atlantic que j'ai mentionné porte justement sur la discrimination de salaires au sein des métiers. J'avais même pris comme exemple le cas des conseillers pour les finances personnelles où l'écart est de plus de 40%.

Mais la discrimination ne s'arrête pas là: il y a aussi les promotions facilement moins accessibles (phénomène du plafond de verre), le fait que les temps partiels concernent plus les femmes (loin d'être souvent le fait de leur plein gré), le fait que les familles monoparentales soient surtout composées de mère, etc...

Le phénomène est assez connu et il est même évoqué dans un article assez vieux (1996) qui est dans la première page de google scholar:
http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2869349
""Les discriminations salariales entre hommes et femmes, «toutes choses inégales par ailleurs»""

En ce qui concerne le choix des professions, effectivement il y a un fort biais de genre mais ça n'annule pas le constat des inégalités salaries.
Au contraire, cela montre que les inégalités femmes/hommes se construisent tôt puisque déjà les femmes sont orientées vers des formations moins rentables.
C'est tout l'intérêt des études de genre qui étudient ces mécanismes.
Et comme tu l'as toi même souligné, certains métiers sont associés à des sexes. Des expériences ont été faites sur des très jeunes enfants, quand on leur demande d'associer des sexes à un métier, ils associent déjà la femme à l'infirmier, l'homme à l'ingénieur, etc...

If southern and northern economies would compete from the same customers inside the Eurozone, then increase of wages would make southern producers more competitive. However southern and northern producers aren't competing against each other, the industries are different. And no, increase of wages in north wouldn't lead to to increase of consumption of southern products and services, they would largely end up to China, the leading maker of consumer products.

Fiscal transfers based on what? Like I said before, if it is GDP/GNI wise, then it will lead money flowing from south to east, not from north to south. Another issue with fiscal transfers is that they go hand in hand with increased responsibility and accountability. If there is to be permanent fiscal transfers, there has to also be increased European supervision of spending of public funds.

&gt;  The two are not mutually exclusive. I defend that we should do austerity when the economy is good, and deficit spending when the recession hits. And of course we should always work to make the state more efficient.

The problem is that austerity wasn't done when the times were good nor were structural reforms. What is the guarantee that these will be done in good times? If European solution is wanted, then there will have to be European supervision of that solution, that will mean that member states have to give more legislative power to the EU.

&gt;  That's not what you were saying. You were saying that the size of government directly impacted the economy. Now you are saying that inefficient and anti-business policy contributes to a troubled economy. I agree.

I was saying that in the context of this whole discussion, the context paying troubled economies in the Eurozone. The fact of the matter is that especially southern countries have too large public sectors compared to private sectors ability to produce: if it wouldn't be a problem, they wouldn't have had to bailed out.

If you were willing to read in-depth articles in the first place, you wouldn't have the simplistic naive views you have now, would you? If every complex matter could be simplified into a single short paragraph, then everything would be sweet and easy, but reality is not like that.

Anyway, I'll try, even though I know you'll latch on some sentence or other, twist it out of context and use it to attack me personally: The Eurozone is an incomplete union that cannot work without some form of fiscal transfers. Countries are not households; some countries will have debts and trade deficits and you can't have a system that assumes they won't have them. Monetary policy is a thing and should be used. Fiscal policy is a thing and should be used. 

&gt; And let me raise another point. Why on the earth does the Bank of Greece has to have more than 3000 employees, why is that in the law? 

Is that even true? Can I see a source?",0,1419871821,null,0,false,0,cn8efll,t3_2qpaib,t1_cn8efll,t1_cn8e4d9,null,1425165104,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7
false,PopeLinux,PORT,Portugal,"&gt; Fiscal transfers based on what? Like I said before, if it is GDP/GNI wise, then it will lead money flowing from south to east, not from north to south.

That means that, currently, the east is poorer than the south. I don't see what's the problem here.

&gt; Another issue with fiscal transfers is that they go hand in hand with increased responsibility and accountability. If there is to be permanent fiscal transfers, there has to also be increased European supervision of spending of public funds.

I'm fine with that. I believe the EU should be a federation like the US, with fiscal transfers, united military, and more powers to the European Parliament. If you don't agree, that's alright. Everyone is entitled to their opinions.

&gt; The problem is that austerity wasn't done when the times were good nor were structural reforms. What is the guarantee that these will be done in good times?

I agree. It's doesn't make it impossible though.

&gt; If European solution is wanted, then there will have to be European supervision of that solution, that will mean that member states have to give more legislative power to the EU.

Again, I'm fine with this.

&gt; The fact of the matter is that especially southern countries have too large public sectors compared to private sectors ability to produce: if it wouldn't be a problem, they wouldn't have had to bailed out. I already made a note in another thread of this whole discussion that in Greece the Bank of Greece is mandated by legislation to have over 3000 employees while the Bank of Finland even with financial supervision counted in can manage with 600 employees total. What the Greek should do is to fire 2400 employees from the Bank of Greece as they are complete waste.

I don't think there is one rule of globalisation that fits all working class outsourcing. Sure, ie mining became unprofitable due to globalisation, but there is little risk of property construction or my local plumber being outsourced to India. 

At times I have felt it would be quicker to bring someone over from India, but that’s a different issue.

Britain set itself up as a service economy, and now the out-souring risk is more pronounced towards the lower middle classes. The British working class is more affected by inward immigration.

Britain has a similar melting pot make up as the US, so this is something you should keep in mind. With the exception of the US, I struggle to think of a nation out there who has not been more affected than the UK by immigration. Ours however dates back to pre Roman times and has been consistent throughout the ages. Their history goes back a couple of centuries.

On immigration however, I broadly agree with you. To me it is not an issue. 

Politicians are good at manipulating issues. I think immigration is an issue to open the door to reform. Now the eurocrat elite in Brussels say it is **non negotiable**, assuming the UK will back down like usual. 

This time it is different, and they will face the spectre of losing what is projected to be the largest EU economy in 2030 and the global centre of finance, for the sake of notionally regulating immigration (that really isn’t a problem anyway) to help (pro EU) Cameron keep public support from UKIP. 

However, if and/or when the eurocrat elites agree to negotiate, then the door is open and everything else is on the table for negotiation. 

As I say, I am pro immigration and we are just seeing political manipulation of short term volatility. 

I just think that after years of doing things correctly and getting zero respect or dialogue from the eurocrat elites in Brussels, the UK Gov are starting to play dirty like everybody else.

Generally, if you want to understand the UK, you need to stop taking immigration seriously as an issue. This all comes down to a Europe of free trade or a United States of Europe. Right now, the UK played by the rules while almost all others cheated, and slowly the free market is becoming a small function of federalization. The UK did not join a project aimed at creating a federal country. It joined a free trade project. At present, the UK is completely isolated in Europe. However, immigration is an issue that can be used to build bridges against the eurocrat elite.

**Moving onto the question of the cause of the crisis.** 

No, free trade did not **cause** the crisis – exactly the opposite.  

[Capital is like water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCxMYC5I3Nc) – it fills the shape of whatever you pour it into. It becomes whatever you put it into. If you put money into a charity, it does good. If you put money into narcotics, it will do bad. If you put money into a flawed single currency project, it will ruin several hundred million lives.

The crisis was caused because under the ECB and the Euro, countries like Greece, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Italy (PIIGS) with historically poor credit ratings, now found that they could borrow at German interest rates. We are talking about countries who had to borrow at 10-15% interest could now borrow at 3-5%. 

I understand that speculation is seen as a dirty word outside of financial circles, but it plays a very important role in terms of fair value discovery and price stability. When value is too far out from fair value, speculators act to bring it into line by buying and selling. They are the regulators of the free market.

[Here](http://cl.ly/image/213C2M1F3X0s) we have an image of price volatility of Onion futures verse Crude Oil – and bare in mind that Crude is often seen as a highly volatile asset. 

The difference is that speculation is banned in Onion trading, but allowed in Oil. 

The reason this matters is that prior to the Euro, when Governments misbehaved, speculators could act in the market and restrict their unstable behaviour via the currency market. Consider Soros breaking the Bank of England. He concluded that the UK Govt was irresponsible for trying to take part in the ERM, and he was absolutely correct and he punished them through the free market.  

Getting punished by the market is much more of a lesson than being fined by a regulator or ratings agency who can be influenced to be lenient or look the other way. There is no moral grey area there. 

With the euro replacing domestic currencies, speculators moved into the bond market. I assume you are aware of the term bond vigilantes, which refers to the ability of the bond market to restrain a government's ability to over-spend and over-borrow. The problem is that a currency can be devalued, and rates can be manipulated, and Governments accept the lesson and learn, but bonds affect how a government is directly funded. 

**By implementing the single currency, the free market was partially forced out of operation.**

Additionally Germany and France flagrantly and frequently broke the rules of the Maastrict Treaty, setting the example that excessive borrowing is ok if you can get away with it.

So what do we have in this perfect shit storm. 

1)	Countries with poor credit ratings able to borrow at German rates for a decade.  
2)	Flagrant disregard from the core for Maastrict rules.
3)	No control over interest rates or currency

These Governments assumed that they could borrow indefinitely, but as soon as recession hit the they folded. 

Normally in a recession a central bank can tinker with interest rates or the money supply to stimulate growth, but being under the ECB and having the euro meant that these countries were trapped, and couldn’t do anything. The ECB is effectively an instrument of Germany and Germany has had an outstanding crisis, benefiting directly from having its currency undervalued by the periphery. So, we have a situation where everybody has broken the rules, and the dominant successful part of Europe is punishing the weak, failed part economically as a consequence, with no way out.

Democratically elected leaders are being ousted (Italy) and replaced by eurocrats. This lack of respect for democracy is leading to support for extremist parties, while youth unemployment is at 50% in a few countries.

You'd think that it literally can’t get any worse, but it probably will.

So, in respect to your comment about free markets and trade causing this crisis… no. Not in a million years. When Barosso made a similar claim, it signified the moment that he lost all credibility on the global stage.

The ECB is a centralised institution and is designed to be a pillar of federalization. It acts as a straight jacket for those underneath its umbrella.

What I have described above is the exemplification of how federalization can lead to crisis – because it blocked the function of the free market and put the economy into the hands of unaccountable beurocrats.

The UK and the US are examples of successful political and currency unions, but our paths were not A, B, C. They were slow process of evolution and negotiation.

The EU is so diverse that its impossible to have one set of rules for everybody, and its madness to try.  All that’s happening now is a crude attempt to displace national identity, but the only effect is that multi generational hatred is building up. 

European unity was there 20-30 years ago because the balance was right, and now it is at risk of shattering. 

The problem is another derivation from where you see. You say federalisation can fix Greece. The Troika is acting as a federal government would, and is failing. Greece will bring a new period of instability. The problem is not whether we need to have XYZ rules to join the ABC club. The question you should ask is what the ABC club is and if it should even exist.

At the end of the day, I see a 50/50 chance of the Eurozone in its current form lasting until the referendum in 2017. All this concern may be in vein.

Di sicuro, ci sara' una vittoria schiacciante Syriza, con conseguente disastrosa fuga dei pochi investimenti rimasti in Grecia e panico finanziario.

Ovviamente per gli stati dell'Euro Forte, cedere al ricatto aprirebbe la porta dell'inferno: anche Italia, Francia, Spagna e Portogallo pretenderebbero altrettanto, quindi la Germania, i Paesi Bassi e tutta l'area Nord si rifiuteranno.

&gt; Yes, we must reduce bureaucratic inefficiency (and make it easier to do business to spur investment). But we can't sacrifice a strong social safety net, which is what austerity means, and what the right wants to do.

There are multiple ways how to achieve a strong social safety net. In the southern and central European countries the providing and paying for the safety is largely outsourced to companies by making it virtually impossible or prohibitively costly to fire permanent employees. However this is totally unworkable. It has lead to a situation where people who are without job, are in many times out of all social safety nets, and with the recent introduction of temporary contacts, younger generations are being exploited.

Another way is that the state pays high enough social and unemployment benefits that give the same security. However this only possible when there are high income taxes for the middle and higher middle wage earners, and the collection of taxes is followed. For example in Denmark it is really easy and affordable for companies to fire employees that they don't need, the safety is provided by the state with high social and unemployment benefits.

Yikes. I was wrong. But I looked it up, and what you write here is also incorrect. 

She proposed that the government undertake an investigation/assessment of the total national cost of ""men’s violence against women"", and then, implicitly with an absolutely massive increase in funding, pay for these various women’s shelters.

It is one thing to read article from a journal, completely another thing to read a speech from politician. 

&gt; The Eurozone is an incomplete union that cannot work without some form of fiscal transfers. Countries are not households; some countries will have debts and trade deficits and you can't have a system that assumes they won't have them. Monetary policy is a thing and should be used. Fiscal policy is a thing and should be used. 

Fiscal transfers are a-okey. However there needs to mechanism for these. Like I have said before in this discussion, if they are based on GDP/GNI, then the money will flow largely to east. If the fiscal transfers are meant to be used in a temporary manner due to unexpected fiscal crisis, that is a-okey. 

However what ever the way is, member states will need to give power to an European institution that will supervise how money is used. Because if money is not used productively, then fiscal transfers will just increase the impoverishing of Europe. 

&gt;  Is that even true? Can I see a source?

Well, I don't think there's any article in an economic journal that advocates to treat countries like households and says that monetary and fiscal policy should never be used.

&gt; Fiscal transfers are a-okey. However there needs to mechanism for these. Like I have said before in this discussion, if they are based on GDP/GNI, then the money will flow largely to east. If the fiscal transfers are meant to be used in a temporary manner due to unexpected fiscal crisis, that is a-okey.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; However what ever the way is, member states will need to give power to an European institution that will supervise how money is used. Because if money is not used productively, then fiscal transfers will just increase the impoverishing of Europe. 

If you had read the linked article you would see that what you're saying is covered. 

&gt; Ha! I read wrong. It isn't mandated to have 3000 employees by the law, it just has that many. Wikipedia article in here. Let me say that if Syriza comes to power, and if they fire the 2400 unnecessary employees, they will win one instant friend from the North. Until that time, I am very skeptical.

While I do agree that if other countries can have equivalent institutions perform the same service with vastly less employees, that's a sign that the Greek institution is overstaffed, I don't really agree that the number of employees in the BoG should be the standard to measure how committed a Greek government is to cutting wasteful expenses.

Nimmt man die Entwicklung der letzten fünf Jahre als Referenz, so muss im Dezember noch mit Ausgaben 616 Mio. Euro gerechnet werden. Damit ergibt sich hochgerechnet für das gesamte Jahr 2014 ein Aufwand von 10,665 Mrd. Euro und somit ein Mehraufwand im Vergleich zum Bundesvoranschlag von über 470 Mio. Euro.

Auch wenn die Beamtenpensionsausgaben nicht so stark wachsen, führen die Ausgabensteigerungen bei den Bundeszuschüssen zur Pensionsversicherung zu enormen finanziellen Problemen des Bundes. Wenn hier Ausgabensteigerungen von jährlich fast 9 % fortgeführt werden sollten, stehen wir in wenigen Jahren vor einem finanziellen Kollaps! Es bedarf daher endlich umfangreicher Reformen, um das System im Sinne der jungen Generationen ins Gleichgewicht zu bekommen. Der wesentliche Hebel zur Stabilisierung der Pensionsausgaben ist das Pensionsantrittsalter. Die Koppelung des Pensionsantrittsalters an die Lebenserwartung ist der einzig gangbare Weg, um die Pensionsausgaben nachhaltig unter Kontrolle zu bringen. Es muss möglich sein, mit der Angleichung des Pensionsantrittsalters auch vermeintlich unangenehme Maßnahmen umzusetzen, wenn sie uns und unseren Enkeln die Pensionen sichern.

Nimmt man die Entwicklung der letzten fünf Jahre als Referenz, so muss im Dezember noch mit Ausgaben 616 Mio. Euro gerechnet werden. Damit ergibt sich hochgerechnet für das gesamte Jahr 2014 ein Aufwand von 10,665 Mrd. Euro und somit ein Mehraufwand im Vergleich zum Bundesvoranschlag von über 470 Mio. Euro. Im Vergleich zu 2013 wachsen also die Pensionsausgaben nicht um die budgetierten 4,1%, sondern um voraussichtlich 8,9%.

**Pensionen stellen mit einem Viertel der Gesamtausgaben das größte Teilbudget des Bundes dar**

Auch wenn die Beamtenpensionsausgaben nicht so stark wachsen, führen die Ausgabensteigerungen bei den Bundeszuschüssen zur Pensionsversicherung zu enormen finanziellen Problemen des Bundes. Wenn hier Ausgabensteigerungen von jährlich fast 9 % fortgeführt werden sollten, stehen wir in wenigen Jahren vor einem finanziellen Kollaps! Es bedarf daher endlich umfangreicher Reformen, um das System im Sinne der jungen Generationen ins Gleichgewicht zu bekommen. Der wesentliche Hebel zur Stabilisierung der Pensionsausgaben ist das Pensionsantrittsalter. Die Koppelung des Pensionsantrittsalters an die Lebenserwartung ist der einzig gangbare Weg, um die Pensionsausgaben nachhaltig unter Kontrolle zu bringen. Es muss möglich sein, mit der Angleichung des Pensionsantrittsalters auch vermeintlich unangenehme Maßnahmen umzusetzen, wenn sie uns und unseren Enkeln die Pensionen sichern. Denn die Folgen einer finanziellen Explosion des Pensionssystems sind wesentlich schmerzlicher und weitreichender als die Reformmaßnahmen selbst.

&gt;The __Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment__,  abbreviated as __CEFR__ or __CEF__, is a guideline used to describe achievements of learners of foreign languages across [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) and, increasingly, in other countries (for example, [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia) and the [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines)). It was put together by the [Council of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe) as the main part of the project ""Language Learning for European Citizenship"" between 1989 and 1996. Its main aim is to provide a method of learning, teaching and assessing which applies to all languages in Europe. In November 2001 a European Union Council Resolution recommended using the CEFR to set up systems of validation of language ability. The six reference levels (see below) are becoming widely accepted as the European standard for grading an individual's language proficiency.

On one side you have the general tits you'll find plentifully on the internet, the far-rights, the racists, the nationalists and all combinations of them. They'll, wrongfully or correctly, claim repression as a means to further their point in any situation. Let's call them **Group A**.

On the other side you have people who are very quick to jump the gun and blast anything that is remotely anti-immigration as racist, ignorant or stupid. Their will is probably good, but they are almost just frustrating as the other group. Let's call them **Group B**.

And then you have people who are neither of these extremes. They are not racist, hold no hatred to people for their background or *anything* along those lines. They have international friends and are generally good people. But, they also happen to think that immigration is not done right. They of course are not outright against immigration, but they believe there is too many numbers coming in (more than we can handle or need), or the people coming in are not good resources (not filling skills gaps or alike).

**Group C**'s reasons are not in any way hateful, moronic or prejudice reasons, but this **Group** C is so fucking scared or weary of being branded as **Group A** by **Group B**, that they don't say anything and keep quiet on what they think is an issue to the country.

This now leads to **Group A** being the only vocal ones against immigration with their thick as shit ideas and clearly hateful spiel. This further scares **Group C**, and you're now in a vicious circle where any sort of critique of immigration is going to land you in bad water.

basically as profit margins on shale oil tighten companies are forced to go to the junk bond markets for more of their capital, Yields are already rising to record highs due to the downward pressure on the oil price and risk that they may never get their money back.

It's a vicious cycle that cuts into their profit margins and in the end may being production to a halt altogether as well as end in a situation where many of these companies will go bankrupt and case an even bigger problem which is the contagion effect of bad debts.

but seem ignorant to this and choose to ignore it so I don't know why I'm bothering to point it out again.

I mean you don't even have to look far to see the current prices are already closing down shale operations and this price could stay the new normal for over a year so when are they going to open again and do you think they are going to just leave that expensive equipment that is paid for on credit just lying around, fact is they have to pay their debts and pay their bills so there wont be any closing down and opening again when the price recovers, running an oil company is not like opening up a lemonade stand on a sunny day

From the Guardian article: [*""Release Marwan Barghouti. He can be Palestine's Nelson Mandela""*](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/28/release-marwan-barghouti-palestines-nelson-mandela) march 2014

&gt;Many believe he could come out of prison, stand for election, win the presidency, unite the Palestinian factions, negotiate a settlement, put it to his people, win their support and then preside over a process of **""truth and reconciliation""** in a newly independent country. (...) **Even Shimon Peres, when he was running for the presidency of Israel, declared he would sign a pardon for Barghouti**. (...) But if peace is ever to come, Israel will have to acknowledge that **Barghouti was a political and not a military leader**, that **he never carried arms** and that **he always opposed actions targeting Israeli civilians**, even while **defending the right of Palestinians to resist.**

There is a campaign to free him that is supported byArchbishop Desmond Tutu, former Taoiseach John Bruton, Nobel peace prize winner Mairead Corrigan Maguire, political activist Angela Davis and many others including now british PMs. Even some writers among the left wing press in Israel  wish to set him free. **There is a strong case to demonstrate he's a political leader, not a murderer and not a terrorist**.


His arrest was unanimously criticized by human rights groups for breaching the Geneva Conventions, including Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and anti-Apartheid activist Ahmed Kathrada.

In fact all the actual testimony against him was for attacks on military forces, which is not terrorism. The only other evidence against him is a single letter for funds to ""fighters"" with his name on it, with no mention of targeting of civilians.

It's not like Estonians hate Finns of course. It's just that people in the more popular tourist spots can have preconceived notions of what a Finn might be after if they see one. For example, even though over 40% of the tourists staying in Estonia for a day or more are Finns, and only about 5% Germans, museums in Tallinn often offer visitor information in German, but not in Finnish, since they don't expect Finns to visit the city to see its rich history.

false,barsoap,SCHL,Sleswig-Holsteen,"Ha! In Germany I don't even need my ID card, the little postcard that informs me about when and where to vote is enough.

If you can get hold of one of those you can cast another vote, unless that person also votes with ID card, at which point they'll see that the same number in the voter register voted, or tried to vote, twice.

It's one of those simple things that should really be done: Require an ID. Heck, it could even be an expired one, it could even be something non-official, like a driving license, all that matters is that you have a photo and the issuer is relatively reliable (as there's always a share of people who don't have a strictly valid ID at the moment).

I probably should exchange my notification card with some neighbour and then challenge the vote on the basis that that was possible...

There's also ample of room for voter intimidation and other shenanigans in traditional postal voting. But it's all harder to do at a grand scale as you don't have so many single points of failure as in internet voting. And requiring many people to pull it off has one, very important Achilles heel: The more people, the higher the probability that there's *some* snitch.

Last, but not least, I'd like to quote the German Federal Constitutional Court. The CCC was challenging the security of voting machines that were used somewhere in Germany, the court listened with interest and attentively (they always do when the CCC is there, they seem to like them), then said, in effect: 

""All that security talk doesn't really matter in the way you think, in particular, it doesn't actually matters whether the system is secure or not. All that matters here is that this is way too involved and specialised knowledge for the average citizen to understand in a reasonable time frame. Understanding that, however, is the basis of allowing citizens to observe the vote, which is a fundamental right, therefore, forget about any kind of electronic voting"".

It was a very nice thing: Asking the court to shoot down voting machines and instead of shooting them down, they nuked the whole issue from orbit.",0,1419884023,null,0,false,0,cn8l7wi,t3_2qp3ic,t1_cn8l7wi,t1_cn88fs5,null,1425161937,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

And then the things men and women are ""allowed"" to do at work and in their freetime are very different depending on the country they are in.

So the only logical explanation for why this is is because there were people in history that had an opinion about correct behaviour and shared it with others. Every region hat different people with different thoughts about correct behaviour which led to the current state.

As for the common denominator of the patient wanting to be healed, I would guess, that not having a public debt of such a proportion to your GDP could be considered the equivalent for public economic policy. 

Finally, you'd be right to assume that political parties in Greece have think tanks. And a normal person would expect various policies to be the product of input from those. But not in Greece mate ;) 

No think tank group could ever propose all the shit that went on with Greek public finances in the latter half of the last century. It's as simple as that. I'm not going to go deep into that cause it would literally mean me writing a freaking book instead of a comment, but feel free to conduct your own research.

En ce qui concerne les differences, elles ont toujours été la, et elles expliquent une difference constante de 2% de chômage et 1% de difference de croissance a la montée et a la descente. La France reprend plus lentement et moins fort, mais elle descend moins vite et moins fort. CELA A TOUJOURS ETE. Mais globalement, la France a toujours eu un chemin parallèle aux US.

Mais plus maintenant.

La raison est simple: alors que les Austeriens ont le contrôle en Europe, ils ont été vaincus aux US. Quand Obama tuait le Sequester et arrivait a faire plier le congres au moment de l'arrêt du financement du gouvernement, les Austeriens Europeens ont impose leurs règles sans aucune validation démocratique ou politique. L'austerite est décidée par des gens non élus, qui ne rendent de compte a personne.

C'est une difference fondamentale.

false,PM_ME_YOUR_LANGER,IREL,Ireland,"&gt; That was the point, are you stupid? This crash for Russia was predicted years ago. Lo and behold here we are, proven right. 

SO you are telling me Russia has experienced a dramatic crash in natural gas revenues when in fact the prices for their natural gas have largely remained constant? 

because what that article is saying is that Russian natural gas business is under threat when in fact it has never been better as they just just signed their biggest every deal to sell gas to china undercutting the US and Canadian LNG plans. If anything they have expanded their revenue stream since that article was written and that is FACT 


&gt;In May, Putin went to Beijing to press for a $400 billion contract to send gas to China through a new pipeline, dubbed Power of Siberia. Alexei Miller, head of Russia’s natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, announced that, after some tense negotiations, a final 30-year deal to supply 38 billion of cubic meters of natural gas annually was signed. This appeared to be a major victory for Putin and a warning both to Europeans, who bought 160 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Gazprom last year (30% of their imports), and to Americans, who would like to supply liquefied natural gas to Asian markets.

So there you go, Russia increased it's total gas sales volume by 38 billlion in one deal alone and recently just signed a second deal with china. Europe has not cut it's imports in any meaningful way either and Turkey has signed on for more gas now too. 

Oh and very few people foreseen the current slump in oil prices and certainly not mainstream economists. You will struggle to find a single reputable source outside of fringe blogs that predict todays prices years ago



&gt;Your inability to understand the article is a personal problem. 

Oh I understand the article just fine, what I don't understand is why you are moving the golaposts from oil to natural gas and using two year old articles to claim a point which is not true. 

&gt; If my sources are wrong you should have no problem refuting it, so far you cant.

There I just did, read above again if you don't understand

&gt;Sorry that Putin's fascist 3rd reich is falling before it began, actually I am not sorry. Believing it ever had a chance was your Santa, but Santa doesnt exist. Bad christmas for you and Russia, long cold winter ahead.

If things go downhill, people will demand for a scapegoat. And the future would very much depend on which scapegoat theory will come out on top. Sure, there's a chance that the blame will be put on the administration that would turn to imperialism and conservative rollback rather than social and economic reform when faced with internal opposition. But how high is that chance really?

You don't need an imperial army and ICBMs to fuck up Europe though, all it would take is some ten thousand armed covert insurgents, and the infrastructure for those won't go away under any circumstances. You don't even need some kind of fascist coup for those to be deployed, all it would take would be some renegade (or at least plausibly deniable non-renegade) army leader.

That's not to say things will always just get worse. Russia still has a sizeable intellectual elite bare of power, even more so when we count in its intellectual diaspora. Or maybe the Russian Orthodox Church will find itself trapped in some kind of kumbaya reform movement. Or maybe anti-imperialist political reform *will* happen in time. Who knows.

The graph basically shows connections between Russian language media in Baltics and important persons connected to those. For example, Edgar Savisaar is the mayor of Tallinn and Nils Ušakovs is the mayor of Riga (yes, both capital city governments have a rather pro-Russia government due to large scale immigration of Russians to the capitals in Soviet times).

That 'empire' controls most of Russian media in Baltics and is a very important tool for the Kremlin. Note that local Russians are used to special privileges from Soviet times (Russian language everywhere) and this media is one tool to make them fight against any reduction of those. That includes protesting against converting Russian schools to Estonian/Latvian/Lithuanian, demanding Russian language special status (currently, it has no official status), portraying pro-Kremlin view of events (Tallinn riots 2007, Georgia war 2008, Ukraine 2014 etc).

Some of these media enterprises have had fines and temporary bans in Latvia and Lithuania for propaganda, but this is, of course, used to show the 'lack of media freedom in Baltics' by the media itself.

Meanwhile, Estonians/Latvians/Lithuanians don't follow that media at all, which means very different attitudes in the same country based on nationality.

Möglicherweise ist das sehr subjektiv. Viele, die in Deutschland den NC nicht schaffen, studieren ja deshalb in Österreich. Ich denke, je nach Interessenslage vermischen verschiedene Gruppierungen der Gesellschaft hier eigentlich 3-4 in Wirklichkeit getrennt zu behandelnde  Themen:

* Thema 1: Arbeitskräftemangel, vor allem wegen geringerer Geburtenzahl. Das ist aus meiner Sicht klar so. 
* Thema 2: Mangel an Facharbeitern, weil möglicherweise zu viele studieren (wird hier eher weniger diskutiert)
* Thema 3: Welche Qualifiktionen, Selektionen, Zugangshürden sind für welche Tätigkeit erforderlich? 
* Thema 4: Welche Bezahlung ist gerecht? Die Wirtschaft will geringere, die Beschäftigten höhere Einkommen.

**ad 3:**
Stellt man hohe Ansprüche, wie Deutschland mit dem Numerus Clausus, so steigt der ""Marktwert"" der Absolventen, also das Gehalt. Die Qualität der Leistungen und Produkte steigt. Auch die deutschen Autos haben deshalb ein besseres Image als jene von Spanien oder Rumänien und die Kunden zahlen auch mehr dafür. Wenn ich mich einer schwierigen Operation unterziehen müsste, hätte ich in einen Arzt mit NC-Selection mehr Vertrauen, als in einen, der kaum Selektionsprozesse durchlaufen musste, oder Selektionen wie in Österreich, wo die durchkommen, die größte Ausdauer haben bei Anmeldeprozeduren zu völlig überfüllten Lehrveranstaltungen. Wenn es um eine Operation mit nur 50% Erfolgsquote geht, bezahle ich lieber mehr für einen guten Arzt, um meine Chancen zu steigern. Mein Eindruck ist, dass durch diese inflationäre Ausbildungspolitik mit immer geringeren Hürden mehr und mehr Schlampereien einreißen. Als Patient kann ich in Österrreich vielen Ärzten nicht mehr vertrauen. Es wird immer schwieriger, festzustellen, welcher Arzt genau und gründlich arbeitet. Man ist gezwungen, viele Patientenrecherchen einzuholen, um festzustellen, welchen Ärzten man noch vertrauen kann. Das frühere Qualitätssiegel Dr. med (mit NC) ist heute nichtssagend geworden. Ein Medizinstudium in Österreich zu bestehen, lässt in vielen Fällen keine Aussage mehr zu, ob man dem fertigen Absolventen dann als Arzt vertrauen kann. Andererseits sind jene, welche in besser bezahlte Gesellschaftsschichten aufsteigen möchten und den NC nicht schaffen, daran interessiert, dass die Zugangshürden geringer werden. Dieser Konflikt wird immer bleiben und liegt in der Natur der Sache. Ist es gerecht, das jemand der intelligenter und/oder fleißiger ist, mehr verdient? Eigentlich regelt das ja der Markt, z.B. bei den Ärzten mit hohen Erfolgsquoten bei schwierigen Operationen, Firmen siedeln sich lieber in Regionen mit Stromnetzen mit geringeren Ausfällen an, Autos mit mehr Zuverlässigkeit und weniger Verbrauch bei mehr Leistung erzielen höhere Preise. So lange jeder die Chance hat, durch mehr Lernen und gute Auffassungsgabe gute Schulerfolge zu erreichen, was spricht dagegen, für Ärzte einen NC als Zugangshürde zu schaffen? Was hier bedauert wird, ist, dass eine ausländischer Arzt, der geringere Selektionsprozesse durchlaufen hat, gleich hoch bezahlt wird wie einer aus Deutschland, der höhere Selektionsprozesse durchlaufen musste. Wer keinen NC will, kann doch in Österreich studieren und dort Arzt werden. Doch in Österreich wandern viele junge Ärzte nach Deutschland aus, weil man dort mehr verdient. Dass die deutschen NC-Ärzte sich dagegen wehren, verstehe ich. Es wird ja auch für rumänische Autos weniger bezahlt als für deutsche, welche viel höhere Qualitätskriterien-Tests durchlaufen müssen. Es gibt ja auch Rankings von Universitäten. Dabei ist Österreich durch die inflationäre Bildungsnivellierungspolitik schon weit nach hinten abgerutscht. Je mehr diese Entwertung der Bildungsabschlüsse fortschreitet, um so weniger werden solche Abschlüsse am Markt wert sein. Arzt ist nicht gleich Arzt, Universität ist nicht gleich Universität und Auto ist nicht gleich Auto. Diskutanten hier gehen jedoch vom Dogma aus, dass jeder Arzt gleich viel kann / wert ist. Das entspricht nicht der Realität. 

**ad 4:**
Am Markt gilt: was einen Wert hat, hat einen Preis. Wenn Selektion durch NC ein Wert ist, dann ist nach Marktgesetzen ein höheres Gehalt normal. Ob und wie weit man Menschen wie einen Marktfaktor betrachten kann, darüber kann man lange streiten. Dass Firmen höhere Einnahmen nur mit hoher Kundenzufriedenheit bekommen, ist eine undiskutierbare Tatsache und limitiert Einkommensmöglichkeiten von Mitarbeitern, welche nicht so gut in der Lage sind, die Kundenzufriedenheit (während der Ausbildung die Zufriedenheit der Lehrer mit den Schülern?) zu erhöhen. Die realen wirtschaftlichen Zusammenhänge lassen da dann oft wenig Spielraum für hohe Einkommenswünsche bei geringerer Leistungsbereitschaft oder Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Aus meiner Sicht ist es fair, wenn es Chancengleichheit gibt. Das kollidiert nicht mit dem NC als Selektionsfaktor. Kollidieren würde demnach nur, wenn nur Reiche oder Protektionskinder studieren könnten. Je höher die Gehälter, um so besser muss die Qualität von Leistungen / Produkten sein, damit am Markt auch ausreichend Käufer dafür gefunden werden. Viele, die in der Wirtschaft stehen, müssen sich täglich dem harten internationalen Wettbewerb stellen. Das geht um so besser, je höher die Qualität ist und je niedriger die Kosten. Der Markt ist oft auch ungerecht wie derzeit bei den großen Elektrizitätsunternehmen in Deutschland. Das treibt viele erstklassige Firmen in die Verlustzone und erhöht den Druck, dass Firmen auch weniger sogar für erstklassige Mitarbeiter bezahlen können, auch wenn sie es wollten, oder noch höhere Ansprüche an Mitarbeiter stellen müssen.  

Beim Thema Arbeitskräftemangel wird nun von allen Kontrahenten der Gesellschaft versucht, die getrennten Themen 1, 3 und 4 kräftig durcheinanderzumischen, die wahren Interessen zu verschleiern und für ihre jeweiligen Interessen zu missbrauchen statt die getrennten Themen einzeln offen und ehrlich durchzuargumentieren. Da wird dann das Thema Fachkräftemangel missbraucht, obwohl es in Wirklichkeit um Gewinn-, Wettbewerbsfähigkeitsinteressen, Einkommensinteressen, Anforderungen an persönliche Qualität, Erleichterung des Zugangs zu höheren Einkommen und Verteilungspolitik geht.

Krugman a refute point-par-point depuis 2008 jusqu'a aujourd'hui l'idiotie de la peur des effets mécaniques de la dette sur les taux d'intérêt. Malgré les Downgrades successifs de la note Francaise la France emprunte a des taux record... vers le bas. Les Bond Vigilantes étaient des fantômes, des Boogie Men. La dette US a augmente mais l'effet Keynesien est en pleine demonstration. Entre 1945 et 1955 la dette US n'a pas diminue. Mais la croissance l'a fait réduire par rapport a l'économie de 60%. La meme chose se passe aujourd'hui et personne en Europe ne le voit!

Aujourd'hui aux US, le deficit est a 500 Milliards, soit 60% de moins qu'il y a juste 3 ans. La part de la dette sur le PIB est en dessous de 3%. Si les choses continuent le deficit va devenir un surplus au milieu de 2015 et les US rembourseront en net de la dette qui de toutes façons est diminuée mécaniquement par la croissance. C'est comme cela que cela se passe depuis 70 ans. 

Mais les eurocrates et les Austeriens ne voient aucune valeur ajoutée a cela. L'austerite est un très bon outil pour imposer un nivellement social, politique, économique. Si tout le monde acquiesce et reconnait la justesse de cette austérité, ils voteront pour des partis très identiques, ils accepteront de rendre les clefs de la protection sociale, ils accepteront la précarité permanente ainsi que sa consequence directe: la docilité.

Mais le pire est que les Americains, oui ces Americains que l'on montre toujours en exemple, on prouvé de manière definitive que la dette a ce niveau n'est pas un problème.

Their political programs are more-or-less the same, but their rhetoric differs. SDS used to be fervently nationalistic, SNSD was the opposite. Now, they have almost completely switched roles, with SNSD rhetoric being fervently nationalistic, populistic and anti-Western (although their political program still states they're pro-NATO and pro-EU), while SDS rhetoric is more conciliatory, while still having an emphasis on preservation of Republika Srpska, which all Serbs do, but through economic strengthening and cooperation.

What SDS says is far more in-line with their political program, then that is the case with SNSD. However, that might be simply because they're the opposition. They have been in power before SNSD and they're responsible (along with other major Bosnian parties at the time), for the criminal and corrupt privatization of social property (Yugoslavia at one time converted state owned property into social property, which was in line with its policy of workers self-management; the democratically elected parties at the beginning of the 90's at the brink of war, during and after the war swiftly converted this property back into state property and then sold it off at bogus tenders, receiving huge kickbacks and ruining the country's industry).

But we're again going into history. What is today the difference between SNSD and SDS and the coalitions gathered around them — the major difference is the rhetoric and that the former are in power, while the latter are not. Bleak view, I know, but such is life in the Balkans.

As per the second part of your question, the police of RS and cantonal police forces in Federation are obliged to cooperate by the Bosnian constitution, and they do. This action was done in cooperation between RS police and Sarajevo cantonal police.

As far as I know, though, it is unusual for the RS police to conduct operations on FBiH territory and vice versa. I think that legally, RS was supposed to send a request to Sarajevo cantonal police, which was then obligated to follow up on the request itself, without RS police getting physically involved on the area of Sarajevo canton, but I really do not know how the law treats this.",0,1419889083,null,0,false,0,cn8o5c7,t3_2qppb0,t1_cn8o5c7,t1_cn8n5hf,null,1425160530,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

You know whats stupid in my mind, the fact that the people in Crimea quite clearly want to be part of Russia and somehow Russia is being sanctioned by the USA and Europe for simply listening to their wishes. anyone who believes those people want to be part of Ukraine is delusional and I challenge anyone to produce an opinion poll saying they want to be Ukrainian, they wanted their independence long before shit went down in Kiev this year too but Ukraine denied it to them but yey all this fuss about giving it back, more dumbfuck American propaganda is all it is, all they want to do is start WW3 so they can take Russia oil like they tried with the Yeltsin puppet government in the 90s and now they have dumbfuck useful idiot eastern Europeans fighting their propaganda war on the Internet for them..yea you pissed me off now but idiots like you being used by the USA to push their own goals just makes me so angry.

but anyway regarding the chinese ethnic angle

&gt;Social Darwinism has reached the level of state religion in modern Chinese society, with the ubiquitous phrases expounding the importance of ""developing oneself"" and ""using one's advantage"" to prove one's fitness over others. There is usually a racial overtone to such talk, with the Han Chinese cast as the dominant race in the globe that - due to national complacency - were recently overtaken by hairy barbarians from the West, but will eventually reinstate their domination over the globe.
Those of other ethnic origins, particularly of African descent, are often spoken of in condescending, almost sub-human terms, as a kind of hapless helper race to be valued for their physical strength and musical talents, but otherwise to be ""managed"" by one of the superior, more ""developed"" races.
Such views are not implicitly conveyed, but explicitly, in the form of an overtly racist natural history taught in the school system wherein Chinese physical characteristics of reduced body hair and physical size are taken to indicate a higher level of racial development over hairier and supposedly more physically robust Europeans and Africans who only recently became civilized and so bear the characteristics of a harsher lifestyle. My students unflinchingly express a condescending affection for Africans, with statements such as, ""I like black people, because, since they are closer to animals, they are really good at sports."" There is a widespread belief among average Chinese that Africans and Chinese are not able to produce offspring together and, therefore, effectively constitute separate species.

&gt;Another key indicator of fascist state organization is the militarization of the youth, which is an integral part of the Chinese education system - and indeed of Chinese working life. All university students in their freshman year are obliged to enroll in five weeks of military training and indoctrination, most of which consists in standing still for long periods of time, marching for hours on end from 5 AM until 1 AM, shouting, ""Yi! Er!"" over and over and mass-rehearsed and largely useless hand-to-hand combat drills.

I have heard the idea of the dominant han repeated elsewhere as well and well it's not like the myth of rude entitled Chinese tourists abroad isn't well known either.

While capitalism is thriving in China there is a huge focus on state controlled industry too

&gt;While Chinese rarely express an open desire for imperialist expansion, an ideological sense of the inevitability of such expansion is a hidden part of national political consciousness. Rather than being self-admitted expansionists, Chinese expansion is instead expressed by characterizing foreign nations as ""part of China"" which must one day be reconquered and brought into the fold of the motherland to redress the historic injustices of foreign domination by restoring territorial integrity.

'The equipment it used was, as that of the entire Polish Army in the west, leased by Great Britain to the Polish government. After the war, a bill for over 68 million pounds sterling, covering the equipment and operating costs of the Polish Air Force in Great Britain, was paid from the Polish gold reserves deposited in Canada. It's ironic that, cynically abandoned by her Western allies in Yalta, after making a contribution of blood to the very survival of the Western democracies, Poland had yet to pay for the privilege. Still, from their standpoint, the Poles were fighting for their own country, hoping to return to a free Poland as her own independent armed forces.'

Bell Aliant is my provider, and I did go through a bunch of throttling nonsense with them. They had limited my speeds to 1.5mbps even though the package I have is ""up to"" 7mbps. After several of their modems dying on me I got fed up with their refurbished equipment and bought my own modem.

Of course, my new modem had many more advanced diagnostics than Aliants locked-down garbage did, so immediately I noticed that my speeds were typically maxing out at ~3mbps but that they had a ""downstream rate cap"" on there for 1.5mbps.

Many calls and complaints (over the course of a few weeks) didn't resolve it, so I took to social media and started calling them out on it. Within 24 hours they called me back and said they put the rate-cap on my line because it was ""unstable at speeds higher than that"". After I mentioned that those stability issues were most likely the fault of their modems constantly overheating, rebooting, and eventually failing, and that I now had a proper modem, they agreed to remove it.

That was about 8 months ago and I haven't lost a single connection, and get around ~3mbps, since.

Long story short, they send out crap equipment, when that fails rather than properly fixing the issue they just limit the speed to something their 10 year old refurbished-many-times-over modems can handle, and then blame it on ""line noise"" if a customer complains.

In my original reply I said 1.5mbps because that's what I'd *still* be getting if I hadn't gone proactive and fought with them over a ""measly"" speed boost (measly in quotes because it's still terrible, but it's double what I had before, so take that as you will).

Sure, provide your sources. However my view is very simple, all refugees should be helped according to our capability (meaning that of course everyone cannot be helped) and all criminals should be punished in accordance with their crime. You're making it easy for yourself by looking at groups but as I made very clear I see individuals. I don't want any one individual to be denied access because some other individual commited a crime as there is no connection between the two. 

&gt;And what of the people who's standard of living is drastically reduced because of the policies that you advocate? 

As I don't care any more about any ""host population"" than I do about people from anywhere else hypothetically if 10 000 refugees are accepted means 10 more rapes, on aggregate people are better off. Sure, some individuals are worse off but a lot more individuals are much better off.

I would also be hesitant to attribute Ireland recent growth to the troika, our economy is completely different to both Greece and Portugal (export rates, for instance). Even if it was due to the troika, applying a blanket austerity program is going to have different effects in different countries based on the economies of said countries. What could potentially create growth in one country could hinder growth in another.

But you try to deny Russia has fascist characteristics, yet claim China is fascist? I'm really confused. I also don't see what China has to do with Russia being fascist.

Sounds like a respectable news site. 

&gt;Those of other ethnic origins, particularly of African descent, are often spoken of in condescending, almost sub-human terms, as a kind of hapless helper race to be valued for their physical strength and musical talents, but otherwise to be ""managed"" by one of the superior, more ""developed"" races. 

Unsourced. Is this really the case? I'm curious.



&gt;Another key indicator of fascist state organization is the militarization of the youth, which is an integral part of the Chinese education system - and indeed of Chinese working life. All university students in their freshman year are obliged to enroll in five weeks of military training and indoctrination, most of which consists in standing still for long periods of time, marching for hours on end from 5 AM until 1 AM, shouting, ""Yi! Er!"" over and over and mass-rehearsed and largely useless hand-to-hand combat drills.

Simply not true. Military service is only mandatory on paper, but since China has so much (male) inhabitants, conscription is not required.

Ich persönlich neige trotzdem eher zu der Meinung, dass Ärzte doch nicht besser werden, wenn man Zugangshürden ganz abschafft. In Österreich sind sie auch nicht ganz abgeschafft, sondern es gibt Eignungstests und ein Kontingent an Studienplätzen, auf die man sich z.B. unabhängig von der Abinote mit Eignungstests bewerben kann. Doch auch meine Meinung ist subjektiv, ich habe alle Oberstufenklassen im Gymnasium und beide Diplomprüfungen im Studium mit Auszeichnung abgeschlossen. Bei meinem Studium haben das bei der ersten Diplomprüfung nur 2%, bei der 2. DP 10% geschafft. Meine Frau wurde Sub Auspiciis Präsidentis promoviert. Da war dann der Bundespräsident bei der Promotion dabei. Wir beide sind ""arme"" Arbeiterkinder gewesen. Meine Frau hat aus dem Elternhaus extremsten Gegenwind gehabt. Noch extremer geht es gar nicht. Darum habe ich kein Verständnis dafür, dass ""arme"" Kinder bei der Bildung benachteiligt sind. Begabte Kinder brauchen keine Nachhilfe, sondern geben Nachhilfe. Ist das nicht der Fall, so sind sie nicht begabt. Der Zugang zum Arztberuf muss aus meiner Sicht selektiv sein. Nur wie das am besten geht, da gibt es möglicherweise doch verschiedene Wege. Dass andere Wege besser als der NC sind, davon bin ich nicht überzeugt. Dass viele dies glauben, macht es für mich nicht richtiger. Ein Aufnahmetest ist doch viel eher nur eine Blitzlichtaufnahme als eine Beurteilung einer Gruppe verschiedener Lehrer über mehrere Jahre, die im NC zum Ausdruck kommt. Ich halte daher Aufnahmetests für ungerechter und weniger treffsicher als den NC. Aber ich weiß, dass meine Meinung nicht viele mit mir teilen. Ich kenne auch sehr viele Leute, die für viele Fachgebiete gleichzeitig sehr begabt sind. Die Fokussierung auf Medizin beim Eignungstest wird daher aus meiner Sicht überschätzt. Die etwas fachunabhängigere Aussagekraft des NC passt da durchaus gut aus meiner Sicht. Dass jene, welche dadurch ""aussortiert"" werden, das lieber anders hätten, muss man auch irgendwie verstehen. Mehr Ausländer rein und/oder mehr Kinder produzieren ist ja durchaus eine logisch notwendige Systemänderung bei der deutschen Demographie. Trotzdem darf auch die fachliche Qualität nicht auf der Strecke bleiben. Wenn ein jordanischer Arzt beim deutschen NC durchkommt, wäre das aus meiner Sicht  gegeben. Aber ich vermute eher, dass Jordanien auch keinen NC hat. Ein jordanischer Arzt kann trotzdem ausgezeichnet sein. Nur so objektiv abgesichert wie mit einem NC ist das dann eben nicht.

Austerity measures stop the bleeding and stabilize the patient.

I am more familiar with Romania's situation. In 2009 IMF extended a 27 billion loan to stabilize the country in exchange for painful structural reforms. Those reforms included a 25% cut in public employees salaries across the board - teachers, doctors, police, etc - and 15% cut in all pensions and welfare benefits. 

We are five years later we still see the political fallout for those austerity decisions. However, the country fully recovered from the recession and from what I understand it shows a substantial economic growth.

The Baltic countries had to take even more stringent austerity measures. Lithuania experienced the worst recession in the EU. Their economy contracted initially by 17%. They undertook painful reforms and now, not only they reversed the trend, but they are the fastest growing economy in the EU.

In other words there is no pixie dust. It's pain, and in so many words, it's survival of the fittest.

I don't know what exactly you mean by this. Basically phoneme=sound, but different pronunciations or realizations of a particular phoneme are called allophones, and German, like all languages, has these. For example, the [ç] sound of *sicher* and the [x] sound of *Dach* can be considered allophones. Phonemes do not really have one pronunciation due to these allophones. 

And, as for the arbitrary nature of English writing, it isn't necessarily arbitrary, it just comes from the nature of English, with many words from French, Germanic, Latin and Greek origins, as well as many, many other loanwords.

An Ideen, die uns die Lieferung von Lebensmitteln erleichtern könnten, mangelt es in Deutschland derzeit nicht. Umso erstaunlicher ist es, dass viele erstmal nach Österreich exportiert werden (müssen), damit die Umsetzung irgendwann auch hierzulande klappt.

Aus München stammt EmmasBox , eine Art Packstation für Lebensmittel, wie sie so ähnlich auch in Großbritannien von großen Supermarktketten ausprobiert wird. Vor wenigen Wochen haben die EmmasBox-Gründer bekannt gegeben, dass sie 2015 vor allem in Wien und Linz zahlreiche Märkte der Pfeiffer-Gruppe (Unimarkt und Zielpunkt) mit ihren Draußenkühlschränken ausstatten wollen.

Ebenfalls im neuen Jahr startet die Rewe-Tochter Billa, Österreichs größte Supermarktkette, eine Kooperation mit dem Berliner Alternativzustell-System Lockbox. Bei dem erhalten Kunden ihre Bestellungen in blauen Kisten direkt nachhause an die Tür geliefert – selbst wenn sie gar nicht zuhause sind. Möglich macht das ein Metall-“Anker”, der in die verschlossene Haustür geklemmt und an dem die Box vom Zusteller mit einem Stahlseil befestigt wird. (Mehr dazu hab ich kürzlich für Krautreporter aufgeschrieben.)

Nun meldet Lockbox, Billa werde Lockbox als Versandoption im Online-Shop anbieten, um Lebensmittel, die morgens bestellt werden, noch am selben Tag zuzustellen (“Same-Day Delivery”). Bislang passierte das abends zwischen 18 und 21 Uhr, künftig werden die Zusteller deutlich flexibler sein – und die Kunden müssen nicht nachhause hetzen.

Die Kooperation mit Billa ist ein ziemlich großes Ding. In Deutschland kooperiert Lockbox-Gründer Thomas Kraker von Schwarzenfeld bislang vor allem mit kleineren Online-Händlern, unter anderem dem Rezepte-Versand Kochzauber.de, dessen Zutaten in einer separaten Kühlkiste per Lockbox zugestellt werden.",0,1419899252,null,0,false,0,cn8tkzi,t3_2qrit3,t1_cn8tkzi,t3_2qrit3,null,1425157941,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

""ch"" can be pronounced [ç] or [x]. Determining which one is just a matter of looking at the vowel. Front vowels are followed by [ç], and back vowels by [x].

But in English, determining the pronunciation of something like ""-ough"" is rather arbitrary because there is no hard rule that says ""pronounced [æf] after this letter and pronounced [o] after this other letter"". You just have to memorize it. And in my opinion, any set of things that you ""just have to memorize"" instead of knowing a rule might as well be called arbitrary.

Too many negative experiences, blatant attacks on Russian interests or complete disregard of Russian position made Russians into the conspiritards they are today, especially when conspiracies were proven correct time and time again. You hold no moral high ground anymore, you lost it when you redrew map of former Yugoslavia, destabilized Middle East under bullshit evidence, ""tortured some folks"", spyed on everyone 24x7, hosted black sites and so on and so forth, plenty of other skeletons in the closet.


The most likely outcome of current crisis (if you believe that Russia will change and Putin will go in some way or another), would be a witch hunt on Russian liberals (guys from 90s, plenty of them stayed in Governmental positions) and a rise of nationalistic tendencies, which would make Russia **temporarily** a better partner for Europe, but in the long run it will have the opposite effect. 


Russia if it were to survive the crisis and potential conflicts both within itself and in places like Central Asia (which probably is the next ""target"" for Great Game with participants like China, U.S and their NGO+CIA business and a weak and waning Russian influence in the region) will turn into a real boogey man, there would be no compromises, no dialogue, no cooperation, just good old hatred and hostility to any actions of the ""general West"". 


I wonder how much time we have left before ""new developments"", probably 2-3 years for prep and ""systemic inertia"", but once things would be put in motion, Central Asia will blow up like Middle East during Arab spring and the place might turn into a bloodbath for a while.

I disagree with this analysis. What EU really wants is stability and commitment to remain in the EU and thus prevent it from facing dissolution. The reason why parties like Syriza are not fancied by Europe is not some evil love for corruption but threats to stability.

Frankly, I don't want Greece and Spain to suffer under austerity if they see a better way or if they do not want it imposed on them. But I am really not certain there is. Well, I am curious as to what happens if Syriza wins. Best case scenario is them going to terms with EU and I hear they did mellow down a bit.
