true,Aemilius_Paulus,RUSS,Russia,"&gt;I couldn't believe in pro-Russian protests because when I was in Kharkiv locals weren't even considering idea/possibility of joining Russia - it was non-sesual

Right, but situation changes. Nobody thought that was possible. Nonsense was the perfect word to describe it. 

Now we have Crimea. Nobody I know ever dreamt of joining with Russia. Now some do, others hate the thought of it. Depends on which one of my friends from back home I ask. Most of the ones who wouldn't mind a union with Russia want one for the jobs. A lot of people go to work in Russia, more jobs there, better pay, easier to get a work visa then in EU (or especially the US). 

But most of the people I know live in Western Ukraine and Northern Moldova, so it isn't even an option for them :P (not that most would want it). However, just about everyone I know doesn't want the enmity between Russia and Ukraine, the trade between the two countries is too close. Ukrainian economy is tanking and it has also always been closely linked to Russia's economy. Hurting trade with Russia is a bad idea. If only the leadership was more sensible, it is possible to have EU in mind as an eventual goal without cutting trade and burning all the bridges with Russia. 


&gt;Probably because both Russia and Ukraine was equally poor back then.

An interesting fact that a lot of people on this sub don't realise is that while Russia isn't very rosy, it actually got a bit better in terms of raw GDP per capita since the USSR. Ukraine is still somehow worse off. Ukrainian economy is literally worse than it was in the stifled Soviet days. And the corruption is insane. Yet a lot of people think here for some reason that the Crimeans wouldn't want to join Russia because 'hurr durr Russia sux'. Well, it is true, we've seen better days, but frankly speaking, Ukraine is in a really bad situation right now, for purely pragmatic reasons I would cast my lot with Russia. Preferably not permanently though, god knows what path Russia is heading with Putin... I thought I knew the man, we all thought we knew the man, but after Crimea it is hard to predict him.

* **Faster/farbror/mormor/morfar/moster/morbror** - we have names for grandparents/aunts/uncles depending on what side of their family they are from. So, if I say my aunt Anna is going to pick me up from school, in Swedish the person will also know if it is my maternal/paternal aunt. I find that really confusing in other languages. I always say stuff like ""my aunt on my mothers side"", ""my maternal grandmother"" etc. I think it is because I am used to give that information, and all of a sudden I can't. 

* **Dygn**. Meaning the whole 24 hours, a day and a night. Is used quite often actually. Used in a sentence like ""I am a fireman, I work 3 *dygn*, then I am off for 6 *dygn*""

* **Orka**. To not have the energy, to be to lazy, or unwilling, a bit depending on the context. 

* **Hinna**. To find the time to, or to be on time. Used in ""We have to *hinna* till tåget"" or ""*Hinner* you  go by the post office?""

* **Mångata**. Literally translated to ""moon road"". When you see the moon in the water on a clear night, so it looks like a road. Looks like [this](http://colourlessgreenlinguistics.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/0f711ae1d0a9f8ed89fda05efebff2f1_720x560.jpg).

And even during the war, Georgia actually managed to get themselves no less dirty, which is no small feat when competing with the Russian military.

People will worry about putting food on the table, gas in the heater, a flat to live in and a job to pay for it all before they will worry about politics.

You are free man, you can think as you please. Doesn't change the fact that there ARE alternatives, including even deeper integration (into one super-state) than these proposed by supporters of federation.

&gt; no sane person should

Please, don't use *ad personum* insults to a large part of EU population. You see - support for federalization is still relatively weak. And there are many reasons for that - most of which are totally alien to Americans, mostly because the path you took while transforming individual states into single federalized country.

&gt; EU can't hold it all together, it will simply fall apart again. 

So far EU is, was, and in foreseeable future: will be holding it together without federalization.

Stop working in absolutes. Nothing will collapse if EU won't turn into federation. Yes, it'll be much weaker entity, but catastrophic scenarios you try to draw are silly. 

EU would collapse only if people would try to implement federation right away. EU citizens are very tied to their national and centuries long cultural identity - and that right now is on a raise, not fall (just look at the results of most recent elections - in Hungary). Federalization would mean nations stepping back to a degree, and that will meet a lot of resistance. It already does, that's why parties like British UKIP gain so much support. 

^(Each time someone compares Angela Merkel to the *empress of Europe* UKIP and similar parties gain one additional supporter, hehe )

What people in EU need right now is a lot of education and agreeing that working for a good of EU means working for their own good, and achievements of EU are as much of their own achievements as they are for everyone else in it. Cause you see - the identity of European Union citizen is something that pretty much doesn't exist in a mind of average citizen within EU countries. And without that - any attempts of federalization will end up as a complete failure.

So please, don't say that ""EU will either go federal or go back to warring with each other"" - it's BS that got nothing to deal with reality. There are many, many alternatives, all of which include keeping EU and pax europa only in different forms and with different jurisdiction.

&gt;*""In short, Enlightenment means borders. Take away borders, and people begin to identify themselves not by territory and law, but by tribe, race or religion. Nationality is composed of land, together with the narrative of its possession. It is this form of territorial loyalty that has enabled people in Western democracies to exist side by side, respecting each other's rights as citizens, despite radical differences in faith, and without any bonds of family, kinship or long-term local custom to sustain the solidarity between them. For on the foundation of territorial attachment it has been possible to build a kind of civic patriotism, which acknowledges institutions and laws as shared possessions, and which can extend a welcome to those who have entered the social contract from outside. You cannot immigrate into a tribe, a family or a faith; but you can immigrate into a country, provided you are prepared to obey the rules that make that country into a home.""*

1. Nations: The argument for border security is a fundamental part of the social contract between citizen and state elected government.

2. Democracy: 70-80% in polls in the UK indicate public support for control/reduction of immigration (the polls blur the exact question likely) as per the anecdotal verdict of the author. The government has lied about immigration and not represented the people. This is a fundamental break-down in democracy and the social contract above.

http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/press-article/75

3. Infrastructure: The real change to the country is numbers in the millions at the record rate of immigration historically for the current 15 year time-period. Pressure on housing (demand and supply and pricing), hospitals, schools, transport and changes to green-belts and planning permission in along with Holland the most densely populated region of Europe (ignoring the micro-states). This is generational change at a high rate affecting most of the country's population. The statistics and reports at Migration Watch are worth looking at: 

http://migrationwatchuk.com/briefing-paper/4.29

&gt;*""Over half a million EU migrants expected in the next 5 years – that is more than the population of Manchester""*

4. Migration: The pull factors of the economy, welfare, language, opportunities of the UK as compared to the push factors of differential in pay, employment, minimum wage across the EU28 for a Treaty set in 1957 to apply to 2014 is clearly badly applied if you look at the actual data on Migration atm. Clearly migration policy of Permits and points-based system of visas etc as used favorably in Australia and Canada is a better ENGINEERING solution to rate of flow of people.

http://www.loc.gov/law/help/points-based-immigration/canada.php#proscons

5. Freedom of Movement of Labour: This appears to be part of the attempt to improve the poor conditions of a region not suited to a currency union. Movement of labour between regions is important part of ""optimum currency unions"" theory due to economic shocks in one region compensated by the ability of the work-force to migrate to other regions to balance. As the UK is not in the self-destructive eurozone (ie it's not a euro-holding member) the rationale here should be questioned why the UK should have to share the freedom of movement of labour with the eurozone countries? Additionally the argument has been made already concerning the Eastern block in reference to their attempt to flee the communist sphere of influence in large numbers seeking a better life in the West due to the ""changes"" to their economies wrought during the privatization cycle in the 1980's. This has led to wage compression in lower-paid industries for the employed and 2m unemployed British citizens. Controls should be possible at times when these conditions are at their maximum.

British people are paying the costs of a eurocratic experiment and man-made disaster with no accountability and no recompense.

6. Welfare System: The UK welfare system is culturally distinct as proven by the negative comments of the EU that it ""courts abuse"" as being ""too generous"". This also adds as another pull factor. Finally the British system of a fair and caring society as per a fair border policy and a fair welfare system is unsupportable in the EU and open to abuse and open to creating an atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion on ""benefits scroungers"" let alone the actual economic costs of such ""free-loaders"" that breaks down trust in society.

So any national Government which relied on the Directive when implementing it is in trouble, as their actions may have been illegal, as there was no Directive.

And as the Charter (arguably) applies to any national law implementing an EU law, all those national laws are also invalid if they also break the Charter (which they almost certainly will).

And even if that wasn't the case, if someone in the EU brings a case against an ISP for illegally collecting their data, their national courts will probably have to interpret the implementing law in accordance with EU law, including the Charter, so there's a good chance the ISP will lose (so ISPs may have to start deleting all their data retained in reliance of the Directive).

No

Turkey has about as many divisions as a country like England does. it was the centre of an empire, so you would think that it would have alot of different ethnic groups and divisions. but it really does not 

their is the possibility of a Kurdistan, like America is pushing for. but that is suggested to be more about the east/west economic gap. 

Sometime I think it would be funny mostly because they could make Batman their capital city.

Considering Location and history, you might think thair was a large greek population. but they were almost all forcefully relocated to greece (and greece recolated turks to turkey) the 120,000 left in Istanbul has droped to 7,000.

trying to carve up a country should never be done anyway, it always ends badly. Natural break up, and independace is one thing, but partitioning another a country is never a good idea. and the time it can take to settle, and the potential economic burdan of doing such would be more damaging than helpful to the EU

&gt;This information leaked from the official meeting of José Manuel Barroso with the Bulgarian politics. Barroso asked Bulgarian politicians not to stand on the way of harsh EU policy towards this project. “We ask Bulgaria to be very careful,” said Barroso.

In other words, EU Commission is bullying weaker members into obedience.

&gt;Mr Barroso said there are “people in Bulgaria who are agents of Russia”, a reference to figures in the ruling Socialist party who have been trying to clinch a bilateral deal with the Kremlin. 

Will Barroso compensate out of his own pocket billions lost for the Bulgarian economy, including the 20% cut for Russian gas? Typical unelected Brussels bureaucrat - pursuing lofty political goals for the ""higher good"" while imposing suffering to the millions.

&gt;Professor Alan Riley, from City University, said the South Stream project – already well under way and intended to produce gas by 2015 – funnels energy long distances from Siberia to the Caucasus and then on to the Balkans purely to circumvent Ukraine. “It makes no sense. It provides no new gas and is intended solely in order to undermine Ukraine, yet the Western policy is now to spend huge sums of money to save Ukraine,” he said. 

Typical British divide-and-conquer approach. Why should Russians and their European clients pursue independent and mutually beneficent agreements when we can entangle them all into a web of interdependence with corrupt banana states that can be influenced by our agents.

Half the industries (conservatively) in Ukraine gave to be scrapped, they would be entirely uncompetitive on the EU market.

Well the rugby team predates partition and rugby teams (as is the case with football teams) under official rules represent the associations they're from rather than national territories, so the IRFU looks after the whole island despite partition.

The soccer teams did split however and were already in the process of doing so before partition. When soccer was brought to Ireland it was set up in Belfast and the organisation that picked the team chose mainly northern protestant players as a result a southern equivalent was set up to pick players from the south. Despite this both association picked players from north and south until 1948. Both played under the name Ireland too professing to be the legitimate Irish team.

I lived in Chernivtsi, there were many Jews there for a long time, now there are none and my parents always told me to never tell anyone that I had a Jewish grandmother on my mother's side. Antisemitism still exists, it's just not the antisemitism that Russia claims is happening. Jews aren't in danger in Ukraine, but nor are they accepted in Ukraine. 

My father worked personally with Yatsenyuk in the late 90s when in the UkrSotsBank in Chernivtsi, my father was one of the head corporate attorneys in their Chernivtsi branch and Yatsenyuk visited them quite often from Kiev and the bank he was working with. One thing he remembers about him was that Yatsenyuk was either Jewish or had at least one Jewish parent and yet curiously enough, he was also pretty much making a secret of it, hiding what was a fact of his life. 

In short, things could improve. As the article notes (I don't know how much you or others here read of it) the antisemitism isn't disputed to not be prevalent in Ukraine per se, but the important difference is that antisemitism is not institutionalised officially.

I like herbal things like the ones I mentioned before [gin included], or other rather distinctive like Goldwasser which is practically not even vodka.

and the only time I had Grey Goose, a friend who treated me to it asked: *...and?* [fancy factor] and I was like: *well, it's vodka...* so, you see, I'm not gonna pretend I'm any competent. I can't even tell a difference between wheat Grey Goose and potato Chopin...

French vodka must be a blasphemy ;D""* a hopeless case, sorry.  

that being said, I thoroughly enjoy all books about all kinds of alcohol and *knowing*, *drinking* not so much. I guess I must be a crypto-snob or somethnig.

true,Seefor,DENK,Copenhagen,"&gt; Yet a lot of people think here for some reason that the Crimeans wouldn't want to join Russia because 'hurr durr Russia sux'. Well, it is true, we've seen better days, but frankly speaking, Ukraine is in a really bad situation right now, for purely pragmatic reasons I would cast my lot with Russia.

You make some interesting points. It is certainly true that for someone like me, coming from a rich Western country, where we know how good we have it, both in terms of income, stability, low levels of corruption etc. we can have a hard time wrapping our heads around the fact that people would choose Russia over a potential future with a society like ours. Of course we then often tend to forget that developing a society like that takes a long time. Look at Poland, for example, often held up as a great example of European integration and development. They've been 10 years in the EU, but GDP per capita is still $13,393 (nominal) compared to $59,190 in my country. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita). 

So it takes a long time to develop a society to our levels. I can certainly see why a lot of people would think more short-term then and choose Russia, which they think might provide a more certain boost in income or jobs in the near future, than the plans of becoming a Western country, which is a very long-term perspective. Of course I still think that this is the right choice to make for Ukraine, since choosing Russia is indeed short-term and actually very uncertain, especially with Putin at the helm. They risk becoming part of a pariah state with a failed economy and a repressive and authoritarian regime.

But it does help to understand the motivations of the pro-Russians, especially with regards to the fact that their concerns are very real and that they should not be demonized.",0,1397025401,null,0,false,0,cgnwcxd,t3_22j2c2,t1_cgnwcxd,t1_cgnhriw,null,1433275736,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Anyway who are we to be lecturing the rest of the world on gay rights? It was not so long ago that Bush was mobilizing voters with the desire to ban gay marriage.

I have [posted about this case previously](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1q5xku/belgian_tax_inspection_starts_proceedings_against/) on /r/europe.

A general timeline:

**1991**: De Gucht is a EU MP for 8 years and head of the bureau of the Liberal Party (one of the three main parties in Belgium), and at the same time he works as a buy out manager. He starts a consortium with a good friend from the Liberal Party that works at the regional government-owned investment fund, and together they invest (his money and the taxpayers money) in a Belgian company in the zinc-industry. 

**1994**: The original owners of the holding that owned the zinc-company are accused (and eventually convicted in 2004) of fraud, involving top-politicians of the Catholic Party. They need to sell of the zinc company.

**2005**: The zinc company got sold to a British competitor, and De Gucht had negotiated pre-sale rights, so he got bought out at a preferential rate. At that time the government-owned investment fund had been privatized IIRC, with the privatization being coordinated by the friend of De Gucht, so I'm not sure how much of the sale went back to the public.

**2009**: fiscal inspection notices discrepancy between expenses (Italian villa of 5 million) and reported income. Asks De Gucht for access to bank records, De Gucht refuses.

**2010**: inspection states suspicion of fraud, which is needed because the statue of limitations is so narrow in fiscal cases (this widens statue of limitations from three to seven years).

**July 2011**: under pressure from the EU and OECD to combat fiscal fraud and tax evasion (Belgium was on the OECD ""grey list"" of tax havens), the Parliament makes the law that allows access to bank records in fraud cases less strict. The law did nearly not pass, as the Socialist Party abstained. In their view, after lobbying of the Liberal Party, the law was severely less then the OECD recommended.

**Mid 2011**: the inspection wants to use the new law to obtain access to the bank records of de Gucht. De Gucht goes to court, claiming that the law is a violation of privacy. He ask the judge to rule that the law should go to the Supreme Court first.

**December 2011**: the court ruled against De Gucht, saying it should not go to the Supreme Court: if you suspect fraud, you can use this law. De Gucht goes in appeal.

**Januari 2012**: Inspection obtains bank statements, demonstrating an untaxed/declared profit of 1,2 million through the sale of the zinc company in 2005. The inspection claims a fine of 900k (De Gucht proposes a 50k settlement). No agreement on a settlement is reached, so a court date is set for January 2015.

**March 2012**: in appeal the court rules in favour of De Gucht, sending the law of 2011 to the Supreme Court, to rule if it is a violation of privacy. De Gucht claims in interview that he is not stalling the investigation, but championing the rights of citizens against a privacy-violating government.

**March 2013**: The Supreme Court rules against De Gucht, validating the law of 2011, i.e. using it is the case of suspected fraud is not a violation of privacy. There is no appeal possible against this ruling.

**December 2013**: In a separate court case, started by De Gucht, the judge ruled that the noted discrepancy between the stated income and the visible expenditures where reasonable grounds for a tax adjustment, but *not for assuming fraud*. **Any evidence obtained in the fraud-investigation is not admissible in court**. The court did not agree with De Gucht, who argued that the regional head of the inspection leading the investigation was biased against him (""wichhunt"").

**January 2014**: Though the court ruled that the regional head of inspection leading the investigation was not biased, he received a reprimand from his superiors (and had already stepped down from the investigation).

**April 2014**: Three leaked letters of De Gucht demonstrate that he contacted the head of the federal tax inspection in 2012 and mid 2013 to complain about the fraud case, and demanding that the regional head of inspection leading the investigation should be pulled of the case. De Gucht admits in the media that he did send those letters, but did never receive a response, nor any help. The next day a fourth leaked letter is published, demonstrating that he not only did receive a response of the head of the tax inspection, the later also send De Gucht internal tax inspection documents that De Gucht could use in his fight against his own tax inspectors.",0,1397027887,null,0,false,0,cgnwwfl,t3_22l8r0,t1_cgnwwfl,t3_22l8r0,null,1433275995,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

Renzi, col suo decisionismo e l'elemosina degli 80 euri, con il suo eloquio da preghiera dei fedeli e le comparsate da Maria DeFilippi, si é rubato quella fetta extra che aveva dato il boost a Grillo.

Pero' c'é da contare che questa demografica non ha capito un cazzo delle europee, e la mattina delle elezioni, sentendo l'Europa troppo lontana, non andrà a votare. D'altro canto, bisogna vedere se il grillino dell'ultima ora se la sente di votare Grillo alle europee o se lo sente troppo ""estremista"" in materia.

L'italiano medio, giovane o vecchio, é mostruosamente conservatore. In piazza ai Vaffanculo ci va, ma all'idea di anni di lacrime e sangue per fare le riforme ed uscire dall'euro, preferisce lo status quo, ""che non si sa mai"".

I've been listening to the BBC World Service the last few weeks, trying to get some more in-depth coverage on the issue. And the Poles are involved in EVERYTHING!

* ""Poles taken among the local population suggest they fear an upcoming Russian invasion"" - who the hell is taking these Poles? Why isn't anybody defending them?

* ""Crimean Tatars boycotted the Poles"" - What have the Poles ever done to THE TATARS?

I mean, people should really stop a) asking the Poles their opinion on any event all the time, and b) taking Poles from everywhere. It's the weirdest thing.

This is a common historical trait and shouldn't confuse anyone. When Britain was building its post Napoleon coalitions it mandated that all its allies had to abolish slavery. The death of the slave trade was considered as important to the British Empire as post-modern thought is to the west today. You cannot be friends with us if you traded in people. So France (among others) had to abolish slavery as part of the process to form the still standing alliance.

Why not impose post modernism on Saudi Arabia then? We don't care about them. SA are friends of convenience. The moment they run out of oil they have no place in the circle of the west. Why bother seeking long term ethical alignment with a friend of convenience? Whether this is a good thing or not is open to debate.

My dad said he lived in Paris and I could stay with him but it turned out he lives on a farm in no mans land Normandy. From Florida to Normandy where no one spoke a lick of English and I didn’t know a word of French.... I Immediately regretted it until I moved to Paris for a better job, met a girl then another girl, then another and another and so on until I met my girlfriend who’s also an American. Next thing you know 7 years went by and its all one huge blur.

I tend to stay with or around other expats as it reminds me of home and they usually want to do the same things and its easier to talk to with people from my country. Don’t get me wrong the French are ok but some times I don’t want to play English teacher or debate politics they dont understand and I just want to talk like the mumblin redneck I am. 

Unpopular opinion, I don’t really like living here, too many things I like doing is damn near impossible or too expensive. I always get people who ask but what about the food or the sights? Have you ever had Mahi Mahi you just caught deep sea fishing off the coast of the Bahamas? or deer jerky?

Yes I ve heard that. But Iam sure the Germans knows what they are doing. On my opinion on the basis of their historical experiences. I understand them they insist on the austerity measures. On a long term you cant spend more than you produce. And if you do that you become indebted. The problem is that becouse of the very strong unions is very hard to decrease public spending. 

I belive that reasons for our weak economic growth are not just in the monetary policy. We have very high taxes becouse of the welfare state. Welfare state its ok but it costs us a lot of money and it became unsustainable. Becouse of European welfare state we must have very high taxes. If you have high taxes you became unattrractive for foreign investments and companies domestic and foreign start to invest elsewhere. If that happens you loose jobs and you loose some taxes. Taxes on profit for example. 

And thats what has happend to us. Our goal should be how to became again atracttive for investments and how to became a place where doing business is simple and easy.

Completely irrelevant, Crimea was part of the sovereign state of Ukraine now, a thing accepted by Russia when they signed the 1994 nuclear arms treaty. Now Russia just up and annexed part of a sovereign country.

&gt;They're not the only ones, in Europe or America, who have ever engaged in annexations, are they?

This is a very stupid argument, based on a logical fallacy from the ""Tu quoque"" family. Just because many nations annexed other territories historically, does not justify Russia doing it now.

(1) that Britain would be able to prosper both inside or outside the EU and therefore the decision to leave or not is really an economic question but a political one.

Two spaces followed by a new line start turn into a line break, like this.^^*[Space][Space][Return]*  
A blank line starts a new paragraph, like this.^^*[Return][Return]*

You can learn about **bold**, *italics* and bullet points by clicking the ""formatting help"" link that is at the lower right of the text box whenever you write a reply.

Before I get to your questions, you'll have to read through the following:

Make a habit out of using proper grammar, capitalization and punctuation. Kudos for at least capitalizing the beginning of sentences, but not capitalizing *I*, or omitting the apostrophe in *I'm* or *don't* mean you just don't give a fuck about putting the least bit of effort into what you write. How, then, do you expect people to even bother reading what you wrote?

 *  What are the european political parties?

[Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_political_party#Current_Europarties).

 *  How are political groups formed?

[Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_groups_of_the_European_Parliament#Requirements_and_privileges), [European Parliament website](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/007f2537e0/Political-groups.html), [official rules](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20090309+RULE-029+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;navigationBar=YES).

 *  Who can be elected for an eurodeputy?

By Eurodeputy you probably mean [MEP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament). How they are elected depends on the country, but any resident adult EU citizen can run (i.e., you don't have to be a citizen of the country you run in).

 *  Do you think that the political groups should nominate their own candidates for president for the European Committee?

I do, assuming that by 'Committee' you mean 'Commission'. You may want to watch the [debate](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22k0k1/the_first_headtohead_debate_between_martin_schulz/) in a few hours.

 *  What are the procedures for electing a president for the European Parliament and the European Committee at the moment?

See [here](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/002fe4ba57/The-President.html) for how the President of the European Parliament is elected. As for the President of the Commission, [see here](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-202_en.htm).

Broadcasting stories in Russian television how Putin is probably not a Russian citizen, or may be a muslim, or how everything he does is morally wrong and damaging to Russia will get you out of air, and probably to jail.

Not so when you have state controlled media, then you have only the state bias and state propaganda.

true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"&gt;Vielleicht sollte es nach Bankenrettung einfach **mehr** Konsequenzen geben

Absolut.

&gt;Wenn eine Bank bankrott ist, dann sollte sie bankrott sein. Und wenn der Staat ihr hilft, aus durchaus berechtigten Systeminteressen, dann sollte man die Bank einfach enteignen. Bankrott heißt ja, dass es eh keine nennenswerten Realwerte mehr gibt, die die Bank besitzt, nach Abzug der Verbindlichkeiten. 

Bitte? Nachdem du ""Realwerte - Verbindlichkeiten"" gerechnet hast, kommt bei dir ein ""nicht nennenswertes"" *positives* ""+x"" heraus?

Da gibts einfach nix mehr zu enteignen, das wird alles -an zb andere Banken- verscherbelt um Schulden zu decken.


&gt;Verstaatlichen, garantiert keine Boni für die Banker, die Bank abwickeln und die übrig gebliebenen Werte irgendwann wieder privatisieren. 

Wait... Wieder bleiben bei dir Werte übrig? Seit wann hat eine Bank mehr reale Werte als imaginäre (hier: negative) Werte? Lass dir das mal nochmal durchn Kopf gehen.

Irgendwie scheinst du nichmal kapiert zu haben, dass ne nahezu insolvente Bank einfach viel, viel mehr Schulden als Werte, geschweige denn als real anzufassende Wertgegenstände hat. Mal drüber nachdenken.

Weiter im Text:

Verstaatlichen hört sich halt so schön an, ist aber bei weitem kein Erfolgsgarant.

Muss man sich individuell überlegen; wenn ich ne Bank notverstaatliche übernehme ich die Schulden mit, beschädige den Staatshaushalt also nachhaltig. Kann also auch nach hinten losgehen und funktioniert mit mehreren Banken schonmal gar nicht. Deshalb hat man in Deutschland und in der EU manche Banken notverstaatlicht (zb Hypo Real Estate) und andere nur ""wie gewöhnlich"" gerettet. Wenn ein Staat -zb Griechenland- als bankrott gilt, fällt Vertstaatlichung außerdem sowieso als Option weg.


Island hat damals ja gleich drei Banken verstaatlicht und ich behaupte Island hatte mit ihren wirtschaftlichen Spielereien [mehr Glück als Verstand.](http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/island-droht-eine-neue-finanzkrise-a-923064.html) Wir werden auch noch sehen, was das für ein Nachspiel haben wird, fein raus ist Island nämlich immer noch und bei weitem nicht:

&gt;In Umfragen bekennt fast jeder zweite Isländer, kaum noch über die Runden zu kommen.

Die krasse Verstaatlichungsaktion war ja nicht so geil, was?
_____________________________________________

Anyways: Mit der Verstaatlichung machst du doch auch nichts anderes als ebenfallss den Steuerzahler die Schulden bezahlen zu lassen?

Warum? Lieber überlegen wie ich Systemrelevanz am besten zerschlage um in Zukunft ein ordentliches Wirtschaften zu haben, das ohne EIngriffe wie ""Bankenrettung auskommt""

Es darf nicht mehr zu Gewinnprivatisierung und Verlustsozialisierung kommen, daher muss das ökonomische Grundprinzip der Eigenhaftung endlich wieder gelten.

C'est ce que disait [De Gaulle, l'Europe dans sa conférence de presse en 1965](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sTxImWjDus). Et à Peyrefitte: ""l'Europe supranationale, c'est la domination par les Américains"". Tu peux nous dire pourquoi un des grands chefs d'Etat de l'histoire de France a dit ça ?

&gt; et ériger des barrières à tout ce qui vient de l'extérieur de la France, a fortiori USA.

Il ne s'asgit pas de devenir la Corée du Nord mais de rétablir **un contrôle** des mouvements de capitaux. Pour rappel c'est ce qu'on faitait dans les années 70, et ce que font actuellement 90% des pays du monde.

&gt; •Les USA (et principalement la CIA) sont responsables de tous les maux du monde moderne, l'Holocauste compris (ou peu s'en faut).

C'est carrément de la diffamation ça. Il dit que les USA ont eu des périodes de grandes liberté et des périodes de pertes de ces libertés. On a eu des gouvernements qui se sont oppposés au nazisme ou au totalitarisme soviétique, tout comme on a eu McCarthy, les coups d'etats en Amérique du Sud et la guerre en Irak. 

On est justement dans une de ces périodes-là, comme on peut le voir avec l'affaire Snowden. De Gaulle pensait que l'OTAN n'aurait plus de raison d'exister une fois l'URSS disparue, or c'est le contraire qui s'est passé, avec les pays baltes qui ont rejoint la construction atlantique. Avec les révolutions colorées et les évènemetns en Ukraine, on assiste à une manoeuvre d'encerclement de la Russie préconisée par Zbigniew Brzezinski, conseiller de Jimmy Carter, dans son livre Le Grand Echiquer.
 Et il ne faut pas mettre les Américains et leurs gouvernements dans le même sac : [Jimmy Carter dit justement que la démocratie aux Etats-Unis ne fonctionne plus.](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/07/former-president-and-commander-in-chief-america-is-no-longer-a-democracy.html)

Et Mitterrand à Benamou : ""les Américains sont voraces, ils veulent un pouvoir sans partage, c'est une guerre invisible, sans morts apparement, mais une guerre à mort"" ?

Heureusement, à moins de révoquer des centaines de lois et tous les traités européens ainsi que révoquer l'autorité de la cour européenne des droits de l'homme, il y a finalement peu qui puisse être fait par des élus FN. Il y a encore moins qui serait accepté par la majorité, et encore moins qui a des chances d'avoir des résultats positifs pour la France.

Donc dans les villes, on assiste à des gesticulations sur le thème de la vengeance sur des associations et en faisant mine de lutter contre un ""communautarisme"" qui n'existe pas vraiment. Ca va continuer, on verra aussi probablement une espèce de retour en arrière sur certains aspects de l'urbanisme, notamment la place de la voiture, mais qui ont peu de chance de donner de meilleurs résultats que les politiques urbanistiques jusqu'à maintenant et de faire revenir les commerces dans les centres appauvris.

School fees in the UK went up because we allow foreigners to come here and that increases demand. Migrants who have more money then the locals are driving up the cost.

Even /r/poliitcs who was strongly for this before now sees how it fucked them.

More people more cost. 

Same goes for why London is so expensive. 

As the other poster said you are not factoring in cost of living. It's relative everywhere you go. Because it has to be.

I'm sure a doctor in Poland can afford to live in a family home in Poland. A doctor in London can't even afford to live in London or the train fare to live outside of it. So they live in an area that is fucking worse then Poland.

true,canteloupy,ZBSuisse,Suisse,"Il y avait un reportage dans le milieu Rom récemment sur M6. C'était pas mal. On voyait de tout. Des voleurs plus ou moins organisés, des mendiants, des travailleurs au noir, des travailleurs officiels établis qui votent, des femmes SDF se faisant expulser de caravanes insalubres sans se faire reloger qui dormaient avec les bébés dans la rue, etc. Ils montraient que parfois ils rentrent au pays, où ils laissent quelquefois leurs enfants et leur ramènent des tas de choses de France. Certains en Roumanie vivent dans de grandes villas alors que d'autres s'entassent dans des quartiers sans eau ni électricité, que les Roumains de l'ethnie majoritaire ont coupé de leurs quartiers avec un mur, et il n'y a pas de ramassage de déchets.

Bref, partout, la misère. La misère dont on sort difficilement quand c'est tout ce qu'on connaît, la misère à laquelle on est acculé dans son pays d'origine et dont les autres pays se foutent. Bien sûr, on peut reprocher aux gens de voler ou de harceler les gens, de ne pas ""bien"" s'occuper de leurs enfants, etc. Mais la question qui vaut la peine de se poser est : le ""meilleur d'entre eux"", celui qui a vraiment envie de s'en sortir, de changer de vie pour le mieux, quelles sont ses opportunités réalistes? Et c'est là que le bât blesse, car pour sortir de ce mode de vie, il devrait trouver un logement, un travail, et couper les cordons avec les siens. Ou s'intégrer dans la société Roumaine qui a l'air de les rejeter. Franchement, à l'heure actuelle, je ne vois pas ça arriver.

Alors il y avait des choses louables là dedans. Il y avait ce village Rom construit par une mairie progressiste avec l'aide d'un architecte, où les gens peuvent habiter tant qu'ils mettent les enfants à l'école, avec un permis de séjour qui leur permet d'avoir un boulôt (tout bêtement la loi Européenne de la libre circulation). Il y avait de l'argent en soutien aux quartiers pour leur permettre d'installer des infrastructures en Roumanie, notamment par Lyon.

Donc voilà, on peut faire de la répression dure, leur dire yaka focon, arrête d'être dans la misère, espèce de pauvre, toi qui ne connais que ça il faut bien que tu saches que c'est mal. Mais ça n'a aucune chance de marcher dans ce contexte de marasme total pour les Roms. Il faut plutôt donner la chance à ceux qui sont motivés de construire quelque chose de solide là où ils sont, et donner de réelles chances d'éducation à leurs enfants.

Personnellement, je pense que sans sédentarité, construire quelque chose de solide est impossible. Mais ça doit venir du dedans. Dans la situation actuelle, la communauté se voit comme un groupe extérieur à tous, rejeté et persécuté, et c'est assez dur de ne pas le comprendre. Leur réaction à certains (profiter des autres avec des larcins ou de la mendicité, sans construire à part ceux qui ont la chance d'avoir de la propriété en Roumanie) est négative, mais elle est compréhensible par une mentalité typiquement humaine de ""un tiens vaut mieux que deux tu l'auras"".",0,1397045757,null,0,false,0,cgnzyft,t3_22ilob,t1_cgnzyft,t1_cgnzh19,null,1433277499,6,false,france,t5_2qhjz,6

Natürlich ist der Bezug Amokläufer - Ego-Shooter sehr viel schwieriger zu erklären bzw. entkräften, weil die Verbindung so naheliegend ist.

Vergangene Amokläufer wie in Winnenden oder in Erfurt haben sich immer als Einzelgänger oder als abseits der Menge lebenden Menschen profiliert. Solche Leute leben oft zurückgezogen beschäftigen sich dann häufiger mit sich selber oder ihren Hobbies wie z.B. Computer und Videospiele. Die prozentuale Anzahl von Amokläufern die Computer benutzen und/oder Videospiele spielen ist also deshalb signifikant höher. Auch muss beachtet werden, dass Videospiele unter jugendliche sehr beliebt sind. Von vornherein ist die Anzahl von Jugendlichen die Videospiele alleine wegen ihrer gesellschaftlichen Relevanz besitzen ziemlich hoch, allein in meiner letzten Abiturklasse gab es glaube ich kaum einen der noch nie einen Ego-Shooter gespielt hat sei es Counter-Strike, Call of Duty, Battlefield oder ähnliches. Dahingegen gibts es auch immer dieses Beispiel was vesucht diesen Fehlschluss aufzudecken: ""Alle Amokläufer aßen Brot, Brot verbieten!"".
Es existieren außerdem Beispiele in denen Täter keine ""Killerspiele"" besaßen oder sonstiges Material. http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoklauf_von_Ansbach

Betrachtet man das ganze Statistisch gab es in den letzten 2 Jahrzehnten 5 Amokläufe an Schulen, prozentual zur Gesamtanzahl an Jugendlichen die ""Killerspiele"" spielen ist dies 0 Komma irgendwas. Eine Relation kann man daraus auch nicht erkennen. 

Auch halte ich die Verbindung zu Schützenvereinen für abwegig, diese dienen den Tätern meiner Meinung nach nur als Mittel zum Zweck, bzw. erleichtern es dem Täter Schießen zu üben und um einen Waffenschein zu bekommen usw. ohne großartig aufzufallen.

In the early 20th century it was a popular assumption that as technology took over work, we'd reduce working hours and increase leisure time. Russell viewed this as a central neccesity to a fulfilling and joyful life. The 8 hour working day was viewed as a stepping stone to a 6 hour and even a 4 hour working day. 

He did, on this account, write ""In Praise of Idleness"" (available here: http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html) 

He viewed the puritan work ethic as a fundamental evil designed by rulers to fool people into working harder for their profit and obfuscate true quality of life. 

I, personally, think that there is a lot to be said for this world view. I'd love to re-construct society in a way which allows much more leisure time for people and neccesitate less drudgery. It is a difficult proposition in a capitalist society, ofcourse, since such a society relies on perpetual economic growth which requires hard labour. Additionally, the technologisation of Industry, in a capitalist society, results in increased profit for sharholders and CEOs by laying off surplus staff. Ideally, it should instead result in workers simply not having to work as much in sectors which are becoming technologized.

But it is not for lack of reason, lack of justification or lack of grievance on the part of Catalans for wanting independence. You refer to *independists* as some kind of entity seperate from the Catalonian population itself. If you made this statement 20 years ago, I would have concurred. But it is hardly a minority sentiment by now; polling has increasingly shown that a majority of Catalans favour independence, with a near total majority in favour of greater autonomy. 

And it is this very attitude in Spain's part that lead to the independence movement in Catalonia to sky rocket in the past few years and is at every step making independence an even more popular option by rejecting a debate for independence. Just 7 years ago, only 15% of Catalans were in favour of independence if given the choice of greater autonomy. Now it levels at 50% and is increasing. That is simply a textbook example of an indicator showing grievances of autonomy left unchecked. 

To sway Catalans away from independence, address the Catalans themselves, not the political parties working for independence. The UK in its campaign against Scottish independence is doing this very thing. After all it doesn't need permission from the Scottish Nationalist Party to sway the Scottish populace. 

If you, and Spanish government officials, have been oblivious of this fact for the past few years, then it is little wonder that the Spanish state is staring down the barrel of Catalan secession.

Why not just use Germany's own counterintelligence authority to uncover the extent of the Americans' activity?

&gt;De Maizière: Counterespionage work cannot be the subject of an interview with SPIEGEL. Please understand that. If all of our suspicions are correct, everything that we are discussing right now isn't even taking place on German soil. That also makes it difficult to assess. However, **I do want state again that cooperation between the intelligence services of the United States, Great Britain and Germany is indispensable to us. It is in our national interest and it cannot be allowed to be harmed** -- not even through the parliament's investigative committee.

De Maizière mentions the cooperation between various intelligence agencies, but what exactly does that cooperation look like? And if Germany believes intelligence sharing with the US and the UK are so important, why isn't the German government more forthcoming with its own citizenry about the extant of its own actions? Notice how the first sentence in his own response to counterintelligence against the US is that it ""cannot be the subject of an interview with SPIEGEL"".

Of course he cannot discuss sensitive matters like this in an interview with a newspaper, but he is essentially hinting that counterintelligence *is* is occurring *against* the US and the UK, and then a few sentences later lauds the cooperation *with* the US and the UK. Isn't this in essence what the intelligence agencies of the US and the UK are doing against Germany? Working together, yet spying on each other? Then why all the fuss about being spied on if you acknowledge you do the same?

&gt;De Maizière: We want to discuss questions, together with experts, about the reform of the digital agenda: What happens when so-called back-doors are built into operating systems -- gateways through which the agencies can get onto a computer? How can we create a secure cloud? How does artificial intelligence compare to human intelligence? What about the recognition of emotion? Are there, as in the stem-cell debate, limits that should not be crossed?

I agree with him here. Governments should not force private companies to compromise their own security in their products just so it makes it easier for them to spy. It's blatantly lying to the customers about their own security expectations, and is kinda creepy and violating in a way.

true,tombox24,null,null,"&gt; that's his proposed scenario of the UK exit from EU, not a starting scenario to step back from.

I don't see your point, yes it is a proposed scenario, and it is also a starting point to step back from. In the table he gives a *very basic* outline for the ideal scenario for the UK outside of the EU. He caveats the table with notes at the bottom of that page. There is also a large section on the negotiation of the exit, check page 26 box 8 for a basic summary.

&gt;so feel free to throw in an appropriate quote to support your statement. :)

Ha OK. Well the quote you give must be taken in context, and although I'm not sure (because its not clear) but I believe he is talking about concessions to the EU *after* an ""out"" vote. I.E. The UK agree to pay its *full membership contributions* until the end of that particular budget, at which point the UK's contributions are renegotiated as part of an exit of the EU. Although he does mention that not paying any membership fee would be beneficial, he states that would be ""almost certainly unachievable"" (bottom of page 11 as a foot note to Box 2). It does seem to be a strange way of putting it, given that the UK could never be part of the EFTA without some form of contribution. But I believe he is just sticking to the format of the argument for consistency's sake. Basically saying it would be best for the UK to pay nothing but acknowledging it would never happen.

&gt;Isn't the whole thing about UK leaving EU out there because UK is a net contributor?

I haven't heard this line of argument, mostly it's a sovereignty thing. Eurosceptics want a more direct democracy, that they feel is missing as part of the EU. Many also believe that in the long run (10-15 years) it would be economically beneficial to be out of the EU, but in the EFTA. Immigration does of course come into it, mass immigration has changed the face of British society very quickly, the British public want to be able to re-assert control over their borders. So its a mixture of Sovereignty, economics and immigration, these three factors vary with importance depending on who you talk to.

&gt;What's the point of leaving EU if they'll still have to keep their law in line with EU (to stay in EFTA).

The paper argues convincingly that we wouldn't. UK companies that export to EU member states would have to comply with EU (EFTA) regulation in the same way every other country around the world trades. But the UK domestic markets that make up the vast vast majority of UK GDP would not be stifled with unnecessary regulation. The section that talks about repealing current EU regulations that have been written into Law and directives in the UK starts on page 30.

Either way, having read the whole document, I feel its a fairly unbiased outline for a strategy the UK should adopt if (and only if) there is and out vote. Its written from the perspective of an outvote having been passed.

No one *important* gives a shit about a Russian or his opinion, so Russians in return don't give a shit about anything at all.


Russians are just like any human are dualistic in nature, the only difference is - being more extreme version of it. This means that Russians can be kind, understanding and caring or unbelievably violent, cruel and hating. Middle ground segment again simply not care.


If given a choice of whom to put as a head of state (although i never voted for the guy) i would choose Putin over a random piece of shit or a western appointed ""prominent opposition leader"", because from my point of view Western leaders/think tanks/politicians/corporations/banks don't give a shit about a Russian or his everyday life, or what he think.

They already showed that attitude time and time again, so in my mind in a pure sense of self-preservation Putin and his buddies oligarchs whom he controls, would be more interested in a prosperous and strong Russia. Need i remind you where did all the stolen money from Russia went from the last 20+ years of plundering Russia? Do you think no one knew where they came from ? Do you think anyone cared?

 
So when i hear about bad corrupt Russia nowadays and how it would be just wonderful if it would be more complacent and cooperative, a small movement upwards starts in the corner of my mouth, with a thought of ""hey, how about you guys would just go and fuck yourself"".


Lastly, about injustice stuff, United States for example has a bigger income inequality disparity than anyone in the world and i believe there are about 50 million people on food stamps or smtn, why no one revolting there, when trillions of dollars are pumped into Wall street? Russians are just as people as Americans, they are not aliens from other Galaxy, their reasoning would be similar if asked.

(prices in euros with USD conversion at bottom)

* 350-400/month rent.  This is a decent cost category to cheap out in, but try to live with other international students, and be as close to a major metro line as you can afford.
* 350/month food (~12eu/day).  You should eat out often, it's a good way to get to know the neighborhood and get a feel for the culture.
* 200/month entertainment (bars/clubs) (3-4x/week @12-15each).  I think this is the place you should be least willing to underspend... enjoy your time, meet friends!
* 250/3-day trip (10-200 for travel, 30/night, food/drink).  Take the overnight bus if you're traveling within spain, and don't spend all your time travelling- get to know your home city.
* 100/month misc (phone bill, metro, school/apt supplies)

Total: 1,250/month &gt; $1,725.50 (15000/year &gt; $20,689.50) + tuition.  The school I attended had a tuition matching program with my public university in the US which I attended on scholarship... so tuition was not bad for me, but it could be an additional expense to consider.

Difficult to say, as the case has yet to come near any substantial argument, all the court cases &amp; discussions up until January next year were about procedural aspects (e.g. did the BBI had sufficient grounds to access his bank records?) and questions formally unrelated to this case (is the 2011 law in accordance with the Constitution?).

So, for completeness sake: we are now in the situation that the BBI is considering whether to appeal or not to the procedural ruling that the indications of fraud found two years ago are not admissible in court when the trail starts in 2015. There has not been a single ruling on the substantial issue (contrary to what shitty newspapers, such as the GVA today, are reporting).

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"Here is the article in case there is a paywall

&gt;IN THESE first days of spring a mood of relief fills Morristown, Tennessee, near the foot of the Great Smoky Mountains. After a harsh winter, clouds of white pear-blossom once more soften the hillsides around town. The air rings with children’s happy cries and the buzz of garden tools. Still more cheeringly, city burghers—led by the mayor, a local state lawmaker and the head of the largest church—no longer face mass arrest, a risk they incurred by vowing to hide a family of asylum-seeking Christian home-schoolers rather than see them deported back to Germany.

&gt;Civil disobedience does not come easily to Morristown, a conservative spot of almost 30,000 souls. Yet city fathers swore to endure jail time, if necessary, to shield Uwe Romeike, his wife Hannelore and their seven children, from federal agents with orders to expel them from Morristown, where they have lived since fleeing Baden-Württemberg in 2008. A stand-off seemed likely when, on March 3rd, the Supreme Court declined to hear a final appeal against the Romeikes’ expulsion, handing victory to the American government, which had always rejected the family’s claims to be refugees from religious and social persecution. However, a day later federal officials put the family’s deportation on indefinite hold—thereby allowing them to stay without setting a legal precedent (and without insulting Germany, a close ally).

&gt;German laws forbid parents from educating their children at home in almost all cases, citing society’s interest in avoiding closed-off “parallel societies”. Germany’s highest court calls schools the best place to bring together children of different beliefs and values, in the name of “lived tolerance”. In plainer language, the Romeikes believe that, if they return to Germany, their children face being taken to school by force. This happened in 2006: the youngsters wept as they were driven away in a police van. (On the next school morning supporters showed up and officers backed off.) Worse, their children might be taken into care—this is the family’s greatest fear, prompting their flight from Germany. As the Romeikes scanned the globe for options, the Home School Legal Defence Association, a Virginia-based group, urged them to apply for asylum in America. The hope was to cause a fuss in the press, says an HSLDA lawyer, Michael Donnelly, and to “fuel the flame of liberty in Germany”.

&gt;In America, home-schooling has been legal in all 50 states for more than a generation. About 2m children are home-schooled. Many but not all are Christians whose parents want to shield them from the wickedness taught at Godless public schools. Mr Romeike, a music teacher, works as the pianist at the First Baptist Church in Morristown, which attracts 1,300 worshippers on a Sunday and boasts its own TV station. The church hosts weekly gatherings for 60 home-schooled families, among them the Romeikes. The children meet friends, play sports and take classes (taught by parents) in everything from science to quilting.

&gt;The Romeikes’ case has fired up social conservatives across America. Their church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention, whose spokesman suggested in March that the Romeikes were unwelcome in Barack Obama’s America because, as a heterosexual married Christian couple with well-grounded children, they represented “the antithesis of this administration’s political agenda”. Morristown’s mayor, Danny Thomas, does not go that far. But he says that locals were deeply upset that the Romeikes were initially granted asylum by a federal immigration judge, only for the government to challenge that ruling. A dapper retired businessman, Mr Thomas was ready to harbour the Romeikes in “some place where they couldn’t be taken”. He is not surprised that home-schooling is on the rise. Christians feel increasingly persecuted, he avers, and it would be hard to find anyone in Morristown who does not believe that “God is being pushed out” of the public sphere. Others call the Romeikes model migrants. Some people come to Morristown “illegally”, says Dean Haun, senior pastor at First Baptist, but the Romeikes did everything by the rules. “They are not on welfare, they’re not asking for handouts. They’re hard-working.”

&gt;Tilman Goins, a Republican who represents Morristown in Tennessee’s House of Representatives, recently condemned Germany’s home-school laws as “promulgated under Adolf Hitler in 1938”. Mr Goins was being obtuse. If there is a link between Germany’s home-schooling policy and Nazism, it is that history helps explain German angst about fringe groups with passionate views that reject the liberal consensus.

&gt;**Father Knows Best v Father State**
Many conservative Christians want to portray the Romeikes as religious martyrs. Yet relating his saga in his hilltop home, flanked by a child’s swing and wide, sloping lawns, Mr Romeike mostly describes a sad story of mutual incomprehension, made worse by official bossiness. His countrymen are suspicious because they do not know much about home-schooling, he suggests. It is “the German mentality: things have to be a certain way.” Piety puzzles them too. “If you believe the Bible you are kind of from the Middle Ages.” Mr Romeike has old-fashioned views, grumbling about German schoolbooks “ridiculing” parents and teachers, for instance. He takes a sternly Biblical line on Creation and homosexuality. But strikingly, he says his children might never have been home-schooled if the two eldest had not been bullied at primary school. Stones were thrown at them. His daughter saw a child’s trousers pulled down. Their headmaster retorted that his school was “peaceful”. Years of legal battles ensued.

&gt;At root, theirs is a story about trust in the individual and the role of the state, revealing wide transatlantic differences. Americans assume that most parents try to do what is best for their children. That can be an uncomfortable principle (there are some daft parents, among them Lexington on a bad day). But the alternative—the presumption that the state knows best—is worse.

Is this getting any press coverage in Germany? And if so, what is it like? I thought it was odd that this article said that home schooling is illegal in Germany, but also mentioned that the reason they haven't been deported is to avoid angering Germany. And if the reason the are deported is because they are not really refugees, why would this anger Germany?

(FYI this is getting very little press coverage in the US. I've only heard of this story once or twice before, it just a little bizarre because I don't associate refugees with being from Europe.)",0,1397053481,null,0,false,0,cgo2gdw,t3_22lwqt,t1_cgo2gdw,t3_22lwqt,null,1433278677,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I'm tracking a few long running fiscal fraud cases such as this to (someday, time permitting ;-) ) illustrate/explore the value of non-pure text ""narrative structures"". 

Basically, I'm convinced that our current model of reporting news like this (a flurry of 5-paragraph pure text articles when a event happens, with an occasional summarizing background text) is not sufficient to deal with slow moving and complex news like this.

IMHO there is room for more visual narrative structures linking (databases) of events, persons, primary sources and writeups. For example, projects such as [Visual Investigative Scenario's](http://vis.occrp.org/) or [Little Sis](http://littlesis.org/).

Such a narrative structure could be gradually expanded when a story like this develops (even crowdsourced?), or could be the result of a datamining operation on a large scale dataset. For example, [in February I won a challenge](http://blog.neo4j.org/2014/02/graph-gist-winter-challenge-winners.html) (in the category Finance) where you needed to develop a prototype/basic analysis using a [graph database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database) to model a complex domain. In this case [I used the large, public ICIJ-dataset of offshore companies](http://gist.neo4j.org/?8724726).

- **Donc ce sera rétabli si ça avait été supprimé ?**

Voilà tout. Il suit donc les choses suivantes sur l'article des déconneurs :

C'est faux, elle ne dénonce pas cela. Elle répond à une supposition du journaliste ""**si** ça avait été supprimé [...] **par exemple**"".

&gt;qu'il n'y a pas d'obligation légale pour une municipalité à fournir des plats de substitution à la viande de porc – contrairement à ce qu'affirme Marine Le Pen.

C'est faux : elle n'affirme pas ça.

&gt;Que dit Marine Le Pen ? Si on résume, elle explique que les mairies FN ne feront pas le choix d'abandonner le porc, dans l'hypothèse où il faudrait se passer de plats de substitution.

C'est faux. Elle n'explique pas cela.

With the information we now have, it seems like the sale of those shares was not ""business income"" and the tax office would have lost the court case. But of course, we'll never know. 

Should the tax office have access to bank accounts based on the mere suspicion of fraud? I would argue that there should be a court order to do this, so that both sides would be heard and an impartial judge eventually decides. 

You're right in saying that in almost all big fiscal cases, there are public accusations and rebuttals. The statements of the former head of the tax office were mostly made after he had been removed from the case, so those don't mean that there was a campaign. But the leaks from the tax office to the press are what I find so surprising. Then again, if you want to see a conspiracy, you'll see it anywhere. I'll assume there wasn't one. 

I believe him using his influence to get the document that helped him, edged on abuse of power. But I wonder if something illegal happened. Like this whole affair, it seems to have been technically legal. Just like many of the loopholes the BBI wanted to investigate.

Usually it takes two to dance - for every cases something problematic benefited the higher-ups, you can also find a reason or two why everyday people agreed with it, too. It is just not so easy to lie to the people. For example, they, too, were a bit on the greedy size - have a nicer  car than the neighbor etc. so went along with it.

The simple truth is, for example the  company I work at in Vienna - as capitalist as it gets - couldn't really deal with the same labor costs and 20% less sales. If that works that way. There is not so much slack in the margin plain simply. Accounting is not magic, it clearly shows these stuff, and this is why although there are good and substantive criticisms of capitalism - like the ones asking the question why are not we self employed - this kind of criticism can simply be refuted by a bit of accounting knowledge. Whoever worked at a company where for example profits were more than 10-20% of labor costs, so if it stopped being capitalist all you would get is a 10-20% raise?

Now if it would be possible to have 20% cut in work time but only 5% cut in sales, we would have it long ago, because the management would use it as a cheap worker retention method instead of always having to give higher and higher pay raises in order to retain the best workers and not make them quit.

This story is about a city council, not a firm. This means it is really easy - because they are just handing over the cost to the local citizens. Just longer queues for renewing a passport or the usual things they do. Or if they hire more employees, the taxpayers just pick up the check. So it is really a case when they can just hand over the cost to someone else and look cool.

true,AlextheXander,null,null,"&gt; I personally think there a lot to be said for that views that assume The Powers That Be oppressing everybody just because they are evil and greedy are flawed.

This is hyperbolic and it is not a claim which i am making. 

&gt; The simple truth is, for example the company I work at in Vienna - as capitalist as it gets - couldn't really deal with the same labor costs and 20% less sales. If that works that way. 

The theory is that productivity will not drop. The reason this experiment is being made is to test that. Its right there in the article.

&gt; Whoever worked at a company where for example profits were more than 10-20% of labor costs, so if it stopped being capitalist all you would get is a 10-20% raise?

From the way that you phrase it i'm not entirely sure what you're saying.

&gt; Now if it would be possible to have 20% cut in work time but only 5% cut in sales, we would have it long ago, because the management would use it as a cheap worker retention method instead of always having to give higher and higher pay raises in order to retain the best workers and not make them quit.

You're relying on a flawed premise. By saying that employers must attract employees you're assuming that workers have leverage. In times of high unemployment such as this, a worker has no leverage because he/she is easily replaceable. Hence, employment happens at the sole premise of the Corporation/Workplace unless the workers in question are organized into Unions who will press their claims and 'blacklist' jobs which corporations refuse to compensate properly. 

Whatmore, in these times, pay raises are halting across Europe and America due to austerity.

&gt; This story is about a city council, not a firm. This means it is really easy - because they are just handing over the cost to the local citizens.

I must again point out that the entire premise for this experiment is the hypothesis that a less intensive work week will result in more productive workers. This means that productivity will not be lost (if the hypothesis proves correct).
Even if additional employees are needed (which will be good to combat unemployment) these extra money can be had through other means than budget cuts.

Non-US media really doesn't care about US States because they are a small part of the larger US. They don't have any relevance to other countries, it's purely US internal politics. That's why most Europeans don't know and don't need to know where US States are.

I would argue that most countries in Europe were more defined by some geographic effects. The nationality has then been constructed to include most of the people inside those borders.

It's regularly in the news because it has substantially different finance laws to its neighbours, something that could only be done because it's a sovereign country. I can't actually remember the last time I saw New York in the news, certainly not when it affected Canada for example. 

Wall Street has been accused to collapsing the *global economy*, both in the recent global crisis, and during the Great Depression (note that the accusations are of questionable value, but they are frequently leveled). American finance regulation has massive outcomes on the economies of most countries.

&gt;Non-US media really doesn't care about US States because they are a small part of the larger US. They don't have any relevance to other countries, it's purely US internal politics. That's why most Europeans don't know and don't need to know where US States are. 

That's my point though, the same thing applies to most European states. For the most part, their relevance is tied almost completely to the regional level. Luxembourgian finance regulation might be relevant for, say, Holland, but it's a completely triviality for Japan. 

This obviously doesn't apply to *all* small European states. Brussels, as the HQ of the EU and NATO, makes Belgium important.

Page 31 and 32 are value judgments on your part that say very little on how scientific minded people in the US are.

That is more relevant to the discussion then the wash on whether or not the US military is well funded enough.

Page 32 isn't a zero sum game, in both instances 90% of the people asked have some trust in the actual military or scientists.

But the point is to keep the stronger sanctions still at the bay and only impose them as a consequence when they're most needed. Because if you go straight to the level 5 then there's nothing left after that except force.

Currently it is important to keep Putin away from his fallback option of further escalating situation with military force. Keeping sanctions in place and extending them only stepwise as necessary while continuing the diplomatic efforts is the most effective way to do it. *Currently* - but the situation is tense and volatile: Putin's foreign policy is a failure, his great project is crumbling, and there is a possibility of him resorting to the fallback option.

Hence I agreed by emphasising the very important caveat *""at the moment""*. I do support diplomatic and economic sanctions. And as Putin has showed no actions nor will to actually de-escalate the situation I think discussing and probably imposing new sanctions will be relevant shortly.

&gt; I mean, Russia doesn't hold back on import bans (Moldova, Lithuania), so why should we?

I think imposing them in a mere tit-for-tat manner would dull the purpose and effectiveness of economic sanctions.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; De Maizière mentions the cooperation between various intelligence agencies, but what exactly does that cooperation look like? And if Germany believes intelligence sharing with the US and the UK are so important, why isn't the German government more forthcoming with its own citizenry about the extant of its own actions?

The extend in the sense of number of occurrences isn't, but the nature of the cooperation is public information as part of [the law](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/g10_2001/__7a.html) that regulates it.  
Specifically, BND can pass on information about terrorism, illegal arms trade and (under certain conditions also) human trafficking to intelligence agencies of foreign countries if:

 * this is necessary to protect foreign- or security interests of Germany, or significant security interests of the foreign nation,  
 * it doesn't contradict overwhelming interests of the affected person that are worthy of protection, notably that the state guarantees an adequate level of privacy protection and it can be assumed that the information will be used in accordance with the principles of a state of law, and  
 * a reciprocal agreement exists.

They can also pass on information concerning the security of NATO troops in Germany.

&gt;  Notice how the first sentence in his own response to counterintelligence against the US is that it ""cannot be the subject of an interview with SPIEGEL"".

*Counterintelligence*. Those are measures concerning other intelligence agencies, particularly about preventing their activities in Germany and against German interests (e.g., trying to figure out if they attempt to listen in on government communication, and taking measures against it). From what has become known so far, there simply weren't any against ""friendly"" services, but there will be.

The exchange of information about potential e.g., terrorist threats is entirely unrelated to this.

&gt;  Isn't this in essence what the intelligence agencies of the US and the UK are doing against Germany?

No, that's intelligence gathering, not counterintelligence.

Ce que je soulignais dans mes précédents messages, c'est qu'il appliquait tout simplement les pouvoirs qu'on lui attribue. Si un conseil municipal peut décider de subventionner ou de soutenir une association arbitrairement, un autre conseil municipal peut défaire cela.

Il n'aura pas à rendre compte devant d'autres personnes que ses électeurs ou son conseil. Si l'action du maire était illégale, il y aurait déjà un dépôt de plainte, t'inquiète pas pour ça... :D

Sinon, le maire est le premier magistrat d'une commune. Il n'a pas besoin de passer par un tribunal pour disposer des pouvoirs de police, puisqu'il représente l'autorité, localement. 

Et non, légalement, tu n'as pas le droit de financer des associations ""partisanes et politiques"". Sachant que ce détail permet d'attaquer en justice des subventions données... mais cela ne signifie pas l'inverse : qu'une association non-partisane *devrait* recevoir automatiquement des subventions (ça serait du grand délire :D).

Cela fait également partie des pouvoirs plus ou moins arbitraires de notre système républicain (le maire a *beaucoup* de pouvoirs, même si on l'ignore souvent). Lorsqu'un autre parti l'utilise, ça choque sûrement moins. Si la LDH trouve que cette décision était illégale ou injuste, elle doit par contre avoir un solide dossier à présenter.

Apparemment, ce n'est pas le cas. Et si le maire justifie cela par l'application de la loi, il pourrait très bien ne pas le justifier du tout. 

C'est une tempête dans un verre d'eau. Une poignée d'associatifs locaux estiment qu'un local gratuit et une subvention leur est naturellement dû. Un maire auquel ils étaient opposés leur retire l'un et l'autre. Des médias et l'association en question trouvent ça très, très, très grave, et appellent à la ""vigilance"".

true,Pwndbyautocorrect,EURO,European Union,"&gt; I know some may regard the diplomatic and economic sanctions imposed so far as underwhelming. But the point is to keep the stronger sanctions still at the bay and only impose them as a consequence when they're most needed. Because if you go straight to the level 5 then there's nothing left after that except force.

The fact is that as they are now, the EU's sanctions on Russia are underwhelming. They do not reflect how serious unilaterally annexing part of another country actually is. Sanctions should reflect how grave the sanctioned deed was instead of only increasing if Russia invades eastern Ukraine **as well**. By that logic, Russia could walk away with Crimea, promising no further action against Ukraine's territorial integrity. As ridiculous as it may sound, many European politicians (including prominent Germans, one in the Parliament and one working for Gazprom) would describe it as a ""victory for diplomacy"".

Furthermore, it's not like economic sanctions cannot be imposed in a gradual manner: why not sanction a/a few Russian banks at first, then keep going if the situation escalates, finally hitting big banks like Sberbank?

&gt; I think imposing them in a mere tit-for-tat manner would dull the purpose and effectiveness of economic sanctions.

Actually, tit-for-tat sanctions are the most common case of economic retaliation. They're widely used worldwide by big players such as China or the U.S. and convey a message: ""Don't think about restricting imports/exports or we'll hit you just as hard"".

&gt; Putin's regime is not going to last forever and it won't fall down softly when its time has run out.

* The Soviet Union's assistance to helping Germany evade the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles and a non-agression pact (and the partitioning of Eastern Europe)set the stage for World War II. Without that pact, Germany would've had to keep its forces divided between two fronts. 

* Soviet repression created deep resentment in most of the places where the Soviet Union established communist governments, which was a driving force behind the expansion of NATO after the wall came down- much of Eastern Europe wanted protection from ever going through a repeat of being under Russian domination.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; The fact is that as they are now, the EU's sanctions on Russia are underwhelming. They do not reflect how serious unilaterally annexing part of another country actually is. Sanctions should reflect how grave the sanctioned deed was instead of only increasing if Russia invades eastern Ukraine as well.

Well, if you view the sanctions merely as a sort of punishment then yes they're an underwhelming punishment, and probably even going to level 5 sanctions straight away would be too mild in that sense. The problem is that then there would be nothing else left but force.

If we are to seek a solution by diplomacy and negotiation then imposing sanctions stepwise as needed is the best strategy. For that you need to keep new sanctions on the table, not impose them all and then have nothing else left. It's also important to let the other side know what will be the next step, and that there is determination to impose that next step. 

In that sense some of Martin Schulz's comments are unfortunate as they imply that there might not be such determination in the EU. Pretty lame stuff coming from him. But on that one point I agree with him - the operative word being ""at the moment"".

&gt; Actually, tit-for-tat sanctions are the most common case of economic retaliation. They're widely used worldwide by big players such as China or the U.S. and convey a message: ""Don't think about restricting imports/exports or we'll hit you just as hard"".

Yes, that's often used in that type of situations. Doesn't mean would the best choise in this situation.

Well, name one country, just one country that doesn't have this problem. Hint: the word ""kickback"" is not of Russian origin. Also, it doesn't affect regular people, not visibly enough, and it's visibility that matters for regular people.

&gt; Corrupt police force and education system means it really loses effectiveness.

Yeah, so there were many court trials in this area, thousands of people went into jails, lost their positions, paid heavy fines. There is, of course, still some corruption, even pretty high for European standards. Those things don't go out on one's wish. But compared to Yeltsin's era? It's night and day.

Exactly. What was considered normal just fifteen or even ten years ago is dragged into the light now.

Why? Don't really know. May be it's somehow connected to the fact that people don't get younger over time, and to the other fact that it's easier to earn money running some business or, say, writing code.

A 50, une entreprise est toujours une start-up, et ne peut pas s'accommoder de ça.

Autre exemple: le CDI/CDD/Intérim.

&gt; Says who? Some guy from outside? I think it's easier to see what's inside when you're, well, inside.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course I don's see everything. Of course I mostly see only two cities. But I have no reasons at all to think that those two rather provincial, backwater cities are special in some way.

Sorry, your argumentation is sort of like ""I never slept with a man. That means homosexuality doesn't exist"". Appealing to personal experience is fine and dandy but it if you only use it you fail to see big picture. Living in Ukraine I never gave or took a bribe and I have friends working in public sector who never took a bribe but that doesn't mean Ukraine has no corruption problem. 

&gt; Well, name one country, just one country that doesn't have this problem. Hint: the word ""kickback"" is not of Russian origin. Also, it doesn't affect regular people, not visibly enough, and it's visibility that matters for regular people.

Every country has problems with crime. Difference is scope of the problem. Scope of the problem in Russia is much wider and at much serious level than in ""first world"" countries. And it does affect people every day. Every day you ride or walk on the roads that are built and maintained by the city, every day you use utilities which are also maintained by the city. And corruption degrades the quality of these things significantly by stealing your money. You can easily visit web sites like RosPil, RosYama or RosZKH (inb4 ""Navalny is national-betrayer kokoko"") for examples of everyday problems people experience because of corruption.

&gt; Yeah, so there were many court trials in this area, thousands of people went into jails, lost their positions, paid heavy fines. There is, of course, still some corruption, even pretty high for European standards. Those things don't go out on one's wish. But compared to Yeltsin's era? It's night and day.

Not many. And you're missing the point here. Corruption is still systematical in Russia. It's not some odd thing that happens once in while.

&gt; Exactly. What was considered normal just fifteen or even ten years ago is dragged into the light now.

It was brought into spotlight by some people but then was quickly swept under the rug because it affected some high rated officials.

&gt; Why? Don't really know. May be it's somehow connected to the fact that people don't get younger over time, and to the other fact that it's easier to earn money running some business or, say, writing code.

In our case I think the immigration flows themselves are fairly self-regulating based on economic opportunity (Latin America, particularly Mexico, is better developed than North Africa) and slow when the jobs just aren't available. The lesser extent of social programs also makes it less desirable to be in the United States unless they're actually working and earning that higher US wage. Generally speaking they're also not fleeing political persecution, so there's not additional pressure to remain in the US even if it the most financially sound move, the exception to this being Cuba. However the US still has a lot of policies based on political immigration that date back decades and centuries to when Europeans were the largest immigrant community and would pile up in port cities in slums even if there wasn't actually any work available based on vague promises.

 Where reform is needed is making sure these immigrants are documented so that they're protected in the workplace, their children aren't being neglected, and they aren't victim to human traffickers.
