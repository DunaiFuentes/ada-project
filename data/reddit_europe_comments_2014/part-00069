true,diredyre,HESW,Hessen,"""Geldschöpfung"" ist ein selten dämliches Wort, es ist doch vollkommen irrelevant ob die Bank den vollen Betrag hat oder nicht solange am Ende die Bilanzen stimmen, den vollen Betrag muss Sie ja nur im Falle eines Kreditausfalls hinlegen und das passiert entsprechend selten. Es ist Aufgabe der Zentralbank die Geldmenge so zu steuern, dass die Preise möglichst wenig fluktuieren und wenn überhaupt leicht zunehmen, Inflation ist deutlich weniger gefährlich als Deflation, aber letztlich versucht sie nur so genau wie möglich die tatsächliche Entwicklung der Wirtschaft abzubilden. 

Wichtig ist die Wertschöpfung und das kannst du ganz einfach selber tun indem du beispielsweise ein Haus baust, das hat Wert und wenn du den Steinbruch etc. auch hast, brauchst du dafür keinerlei Schulden zu machen. Die Wirtschaft schafft Wert und Geld ist lediglich Mittel zum Zweck um das ganze einfacher zu machen. Der Sinn der Banken ist es das Kapital so zu verteilen, dass die Wirtschaft am produktivsten funktioniert, der mit der guten Idee bekommt Kapital, der mit der schlechten nicht, in der Theorie zumindest. Solange sie das richtig machen und nicht in irgendwelche Blasen reinstolpern sind sie nicht nur nützlich sondern sogar notwendig.

Source? Did Putin shoot the demonstrators? He just wait till the Olympics were at it's best and started to slaughter people on Kiev? Or did that order came from west to the protesters? Or did they made that decision by themselves? 

And why Russia needs to even bother to send troops to Crimea when they already have there over 12,000 legally? And 2/3rd of Ukraine Army in Crimea has fled? The people of Crimea have made their mind: they want to get security, they don't want the unrest west Ukraine shit and that is their right. And you are dragging Putin everywhere...

A quick search through his letters reveals that he certainly does have a concept of Italy as a whole, of which Florence (and supposedly, the other city-states) is a part. 

Example:

""Li Magnifici Signori Dieci — desiderando che la munitione et fortificazione della nostra città, dopo lunga discussione et matura consultatione finalmente giudicata non solo utile, ma necessaria a resistere agii imminenti pericoli che si veggono ogni giorno non solo a noi, ma a tutta Italia, per le frequenti inundationi de' barbari""

[source: https://archive.org/stream/laletteredimich00buongoog/laletteredimich00buongoog_djvu.txt]


[My translation]

""The magnificent Ten Lords, deliberating, after long and careful discussion, that the fortification of our city be not only useful but necessary to resist the imminent dangers we see everyday, **not only for us, but for all of Italy**, of recurring barbaric invasions..."" 

Either way, it's true what goerz said... there's this weird recurring habit on the internet of somehow dismissing Italy as a fabricated notion that has only existed for the last three or four generations. Italy, as a concept, has existed for millennia. And the more recent process that led to the Italian Unification traces back to at least the late middle ages (Dante, etc.)

In the context of this thread things are even more bizarre, as some people are suggesting that Italy has no specific claim to the works of Michelangelo, apparently because the artist wouldn't be able to produce an Italian Birth Certificate. I never hear people say that modern Egypt shouldn't hold a claim over the pyramids of Giza and a right to exploit them and a duty to preserve them, and the discontinuity, in the case of Egypt, is much larger.

The equalism movement is a new one. I don't call myself an equalist or a gender humanist or what have you because I don't much about it.

È irrilevante ai fini di questa discussione. Per un cristiano, Gesù ha detto quelle parole. In un'ottica cristiana, quindi, si può opporre quella frase di Gesù agli eccessi dell'automortificazione. Gesù ha più autorità in materia di qualsiasi teologo o papa o santo.

No, se in un determinato momento provi una qualsiasi emozione, per me in quel momento non sei razionale, perché non pensi al 100% lucidamente.

Let's first correct that one a bit: *""The Nazis were famous for their oppressive nature, and now in Germany, to combat this, there are strict oppressive laws to quell the bad forms of ""free"" expression.""*

At least that is what I assume it is supposed to mean. It's still not quite correct, but lets keep it that way for now.

This sentence, by the way, is not a question.

The equivalence comes with the structure* ""The Nazis were famous for their oppressive nature, and now in Germany [...] there are strict oppressive laws [...].""* 

This is what is called a coordinating conjunction, in which two subjects are being linked with similar values.The word ""and"" specifically links both values (""oppressive Nazis"" = ""oppressive modern Germans""). **So here was exactly when you used the word Nazi not to describe modern Germans, but to set Nazis and modern Germans as equal in your sentence.** 

The solution here is easy: you want a ""but"" instead of ""and"". A ""but"" also makes this a coordinating conjunction, but one which contrasts instead of equalizes the two parts of the sentence. 


And while I'm at it, lets go full grammar nazi (hehe) and try to find out what you actually were trying to say:

It doesn't help that you didn't use punctuation, so it actually reads: ""The Nazi's were famous for their oppressive nature and now in Germany [...]"" which makes it read like the nazis still are in Germany. In addition later in the sentence you write ""their are"". From a cursory reading you could get that ""their's"" are oppressive laws, or that ""they"" are strict. Lets keep that as ""There are"".

Even with punctuation ""to combat this"" just dangles around. What you actually say here is that the laws are in place to combat the fact that the nazis were famous for something. So we should forget that they were oppressive? Not likely. We will have to make sure what actually needs to be fought.

I am also not quite sure about your use of quotation marks around ""free"". The way you wrote it it reads as if expression cannot be free in the first place. It might make more sense to say ""to quell the ""bad"" forms of free expression"". Quoting ""bad"" here shows the opinion that that expression is free, but that the Germans claim some forms of them are bad. 

To get the whole thing down in one sentence: *""The Nazis were famous for their oppressive nature, but to combat this nature Germany now uses strict oppressive laws to quell the ""bad"" forms of free expression.""*

And this is a statement we can discuss about.

Do you understand what 'Minister' means in this context? Looking at this and other comments of yours, it looks like you're misunderstanding the word itself. 

In English the word minister means a number of things, and in some areas (especially in North America) it means some kind of Church official, a preacher, or something like that. In Europe, when we say 'minister', in most cases we are referring to Government Ministers. Basically, it's what in the U.S. is called a Secretary: so the Minister of Defense is the equivalent of the Secretary of Defense; the Minister of Foreign affairs is the equivalent of the Secretary of State, etc. 

Does that makes things any clearer for you? The Minister of Culture is part of the Government of Italy...

Anche no. Io ricordo prediche di povertà, che non vengono seguite in nessun modo, come buona parte delle parole, che restano vuote bandiere sventolate e mai seguite davvero dai fedeli, ai quali interessa molto di più la promessa di redenzione e vita eterna piuttosto che il doversela guadagnare con carità, povertà, altruismo, e assistenza (salvo una rara percentuale che in effetti segue le parole di Gesù, e solitamente guarda con sdegno simile al mio l'establishment clericale).

edit: è anche noto che Maria Teresa di Calcutta (santa), antiabortista militante, ha pagato per una campagna in Irlanda per rendere illegale il divorzio (salvo poi appoggiare quello della sua amica Lady Diana), e negava ai malati terminali cure palliative in punto di morte, perchè riteneva che la sofferenza avvicinasse a Dio. Un'inchiesta del Guardian ha portato alla luce le condizioni disumane degli orfani nei suoi orfanotrofi, e tra l'altro pare fosse atea, da alcuni suoi scambi epistolari. Tuttavia è stata santificata in tempi da record, e ha portato un sacco di soldini allo IOR.

Ecco, a me fa rabbia. Non abbastanza da fare danni a nessuno, ma abbastanza per convincermi che una struttura che spalleggia persone simili e le tiene a baluardo ed esempio sia completamente marcia e dannosa per l'umanità.

&gt; No, se in un determinato momento provi una qualsiasi emozione, per me in quel momento non sei razionale, perché non pensi al 100% lucidamente.

Discordo: ci sono tantissime figure storiche mosse da passioni fortissime, sia in campo religioso che di ricerca, sia filosofi che politici, che hanno fatto della ragione il loro strumento, e della passione la loro bussola. Detta come la dici tu sembra che solo i Borg siano razionali, e chiunque altro sia da tenere meno in considerazione solo perchè prova emozioni... ma forse ho capito male io.

La rabbia non annebbia il cervello se tu non glielo lasci annebbiare. Mi fa rabbia quando sento che un militare con la moglie incinta a casa è morto in missione, e nonostante questa rabbia non credo che la mia reazione sia poco lucida.

Non capisco , c'è questa specie di leggenda secondo cui gli atei non provino emozioni e siano super razionali.. Si possono avere delle emozioni e continuare a vederci senza alcun problema. Non ho chiesto a nessuno di andare ad appiccare il fuoco alle chiese, credo sia un handicap culturale che vada risolto con calma, nel tempo, con l'educazione e l'illuminismo, non di certo con la violenza. Al contempo la consapevolezza dei limiti imposti da tale handicap mi fa rabbia, e non credo sia normale il non provarne.

Vorrei sapere se vedere la gente che si lava la coscienza pregando invece di risolvere i problemi del mondo non ti fa un po' rabbia, o se quelli che escono dalla chiesa guardano con disprezzo il mendicante zoppo davanti alla porta della chiesa non ti irritano un po', o se non ti fa incazzare vedere il presidente di una delle più ricche banche al mondo, indagata per riciclaggio in molti stati, predicare la povertà a mezzo pianeta.

Non so, a me un po' da fastidio. Poi vedi tu.

PS: non sto cercando di convincerti a diventare ateo. La fede è un'esperienza assolutamente personale e interiore, su cui nessuno può aprire bocca, secondo me, e che andrebbe tenuta rigorosamente personale. Sto parlando dell'istituzione politica ed economica che sfrutta la fede per soldi e potere.

**Non.**

Il faut absolument sortir de cette logique binaire.

Il dit très exactement :

*L'Europe représente plus de la moitié des importations-exportations russes. On a une forte interdépendance en matière énergétique et économique : peu de Français savent que plus d'un million d'automobiles construites en Russie, soit un tiers du total, sont produites par des marques françaises... Peu de gens ont l'idée des énormes investissements faits dans la péninsule de Yamal pour mettre en valeur des gisements de gaz naturel. Ce sont des investissements considérables (30 milliards) dans lesquels Total notamment intervient. La Russie est un pays réémergent proche, Moscou est à trois heures de Paris. Les entreprises françaises installées en Russie ne souhaitent pas du tout que la crise s'envenime.*

Nous avons déjà sacrifié notre industrie automobile en Iran avec PSA, ne faisons pas la même chose avec la Russie pour faire plaisir aux américains. Ce qui doit compter dans la politique française, ce sont les intérêts français.

Il compare cela aux États-Unis, et se demande ce que ces derniers nous apportent. En effet, il apparaît que la politique monétaire américaine nous est extrêmement néfaste, et favorise les délocalisations vers les pays en zone dollar.

**Le XXIe siècle ne doit pas se résumer au tête-à-tête de la Chine et des États-Unis. Il est souhaitable que l'Europe s'organise pour exister par elle-même.**

And to be honest I feel like when you're from somewhere else it's probably not a bad idea to write a somewhat longer letter since the person reading this will want to know more about you since you're not german.  
I feel like focusing more on your skills and experiences would benefit you more in this case.  
And from my personal experiences there are a couple of things which matter alot to people who want to hire somebody:  
-If you've taken the info for the appliance out of the internet or somewhere else you need to write atleast 1 paragraph about the skills and experiences that are required in the info. Especially if you DON'T have the required skills.  
(For example i'm a design engineer and for my job it was required to know a special constructing program which I sadly had no idea of. But in my application if wrote that I didn't know this program but I would be more than willing to learn/study this program to enhance my skills. And I got the job.)  
What I want to say is: If you read the stuff which is required don't be intimitaded by this but rather focus on those skills and make a statement about each and every one of them so the employer sees that you're honest and willing to learn. This count just as much as your grades and stuff.  
What I'm trying to say is. You should rather write more than less since every question unanswered which comes to your potential future boss he'd probably rather drop your application than to call you back and ask.

To be Commission President, you have to be proposed by the heads of the national parliaments (Cameron, Merkel, Hollande etc.) to the Parliament, which either approves or rejects you. This like how the Queen offers a prospective Prime Minister to try to form a government after an election.

However, the problem was that in past European elections, the parties gave no indication of who'd they support, so Parliament's approval was more of a rubber stamping procedure. They worked in the vacuum of the European legislature and just approved each other's suggestions.

However, now, the public knows who the parties would approve of, and as is the case in coalitions, you can get a feel of which parties would work together.

Note you could still very well argue that many of those doing the trafficking in the streets are desperate people and in many cases forced to do it. But that's OK, no one cares.

That is, you can take up employment like a national after you graduate (within those 18 months), and unless you become unemployed for an extended period of time, you'll be fine and keep your work permit until it eventually becomes permanent.  
Since you're a business student, think of it as the German tax payer having an interest in you staying and paying taxes and social contributions here after the state has invested in your education. But if you fail to find a relevant job before those 18 months are up, there's apparently no demand for you on the labor market, so we write the investment off and you fall back to ""external"" status which means you'd have to meet the minimum salary requirement just as if you were a non-EEA applicant who had studied elsewhere.

true,komodenu,null,null,"Il serait triste que nous devions en revenir à la boulè pour avoir des représentants représentatifs. 

Les sujets abordés par les législateurs, aujourd'hui, sont très techniques et il y a un fort risque qu'une personne tirée au hasard ne soit juste pas intéressée par le sujet (on voit ce que ça peut provoquer dans le fonctionnement de la justice étatsunienne lorsque des jurys populaires sont tirés au sort).

En dehors des soupçons de corruption, quel est le problème de nos représentants, aujourd'hui ? Je dirais qu'il est celui-ci (et nous l'entendons régulièrement) : ils considèrent que le courage en politique est d'aller à l'encontre de la volonté de ses électeurs. Or cela devrait être vu comme un vice, et non comme une vertu.

Comment peut-on en finir avec ce vice ? Un moyen simple, sans nécessiter une refonte complète des institutions, serait de garantir la révocabilité des élus. Si un élu ne représente plus ses représentés, ceux-ci doivent pouvoir le congédier à tout moment et en choisir un nouveau.

Il faudrait bien entendu une proportionelle intégrale pour permettre ça : il ne s'agirait pas que les électeurs ayant voté pour un candidat de tel bord tentent de révoquer immédiatement le candidat de l'autre bord qui aurait été élu par la majorité. Pour que les élections soient démocratiques, il faut que chacun soit représenté par quelqu'un ... qui le représente.

Peut-on faire mieux ? Certainement. Congédier un représentant revient à régler un problème une fois que le mal a été fait. Nous sommes aujourd'hui à l'époque de la communication instantanée à travers le monde entier. Pourquoi avons-nous besoin de représentants ? Certainement pas parce que nous n'avons pas les moyens techniques de faire entendre la voix de chacun. Mais plutôt parce que chacun à autre chose à faire que de participer à chaque décision. 

Si on accepte cela, la conclusion logique devrait être qu'il doit être permis sur chaque vote au représenté de reprendre la main sur le représentant. Si je veux participer au vote d'une loi, j'y participe. Si mon représentant vallait précédemment 100 voix, il en vaut désormais 99 et j'en vaux 1. Cela permet à la fois d'être certain du vote fait en notre nom sur les sujets qui nous importent, et ça peut servir d'avertissement au représenté (si tous ses représentés reprennent la main, il risque d'ête congédié rapidement).",0,1394455481,null,0,false,0,cfywzg0,t3_201hnz,t1_cfywzg0,t3_201hnz,null,1432736436,12,false,france,t5_2qhjz,12

Aber egal, ja die Bilanzen müssen schon stimmen, das ist klar. Aber dennoch ist die gesamte Schaffung von Geld mit Zinsen und damit mit Schuld belegt und wenn alles Geld nur mit Zins geschaffen wird, dann müsste nach einfachen mathematischen Gesetzen immer mehr zurückgezahlt werden, als geschaffen wurde und das ist praktisch in Geldwert nicht machbar.

Das irgendwelche Werte hinter dem Geld stehen ist dabei irrelevant, wenn man nur vom Geld an sich spricht. Ich kann meine Bank ja nicht mit Brötchen bezahlen. Und wenn ich mein Haus an die abtrete, bekomme ich nie dafür den Wert um den Kredit vollständig zu decken.

EDIT: Ein gutes Beispiel sind ja Autokredite. In der Regel ist es so, dass der Wert der Fahrzeuge viel schneller verfällt als die Tilgung des Kredites angsetzt ist, d.h. mein Auto ist nach kurzer Zeit nur noch die Hälfte Wert, obwohl die Tilgung des Kredites nicht mal annähernd zur Hälfte abgeschlossen ist. Somit steht hinter dem Kredit bereits nach kurzer Zeit kein Wert mehr, sondern nur der Glaube der Bank in den Kreditnehmer, dass er seinen Kredit dennoch abtragen wird, welcher aber in keinster Weise mehr mit einem realen Wert verknüpft ist.
So ist es mit sehr vielen Krediten für Privatkunden. Wenn man das realistisch gestalten würde, also die Kreditraten an den Wertverlust des finanzierten Gutes koppeln würde, wären bei vielen Waren die Tilgungsraten wohl um ein vielfaches höher. Darum stolpern auch immer mehr Menschen in die Kreditfalle, weil sie langjährige Kredite für Waren aufnehmen, die garnicht so lange halten oder deren Wert garnicht so lange hält.

La loi fixe les règles concernant : 

- les droits civiques et les garanties fondamentales accordées aux citoyens pour l'exercice des libertés publiques ; la liberté, le pluralisme et l'indépendance des médias ; les sujétions imposées par la défense nationale aux citoyens en leur personne et en leurs biens ; - **Rien de technique**
- la nationalité, l'état et la capacité des personnes, les régimes matrimoniaux, les successions et libéralités ;  - **Rien de technique**
- la détermination des crimes et délits ainsi que les peines qui leur sont applicables ; la procédure pénale ; l'amnistie ; la création de nouveaux ordres de juridiction et le statut des magistrats ; - **Rien de technique**
- l'assiette, le taux et les modalités de recouvrement des impositions de toutes natures ; le régime d'émission de la monnaie. - **À mon avis déjà trop technique pour les députés**
- le régime électoral des assemblées parlementaires, des assemblées locales et des instances représentatives des Français établis hors de France ainsi que les conditions d'exercice des mandats électoraux et des fonctions électives des membres des assemblées délibérantes des collectivités territoriales ;   - **Rien de technique**
- la création de catégories d'établissements publics ;   - **Aucune idée**
- les garanties fondamentales accordées aux fonctionnaires civils et militaires de l'État ;   - **Rien de technique**
- les nationalisations d'entreprises et les transferts de propriété d'entreprises du secteur public au secteur privé.   - **Technique**

La loi détermine les principes fondamentaux : 

- de l'organisation générale de la défense nationale ; - **Technique** 
- de la libre administration des collectivités territoriales, de leurs compétences et de leurs ressources ; - **Rien de technique**
- de l'enseignement ;  - **Rien de technique**
- de la préservation de l'environnement ;  - **Assez technique**
- du régime de la propriété, des droits réels et des obligations civiles et commerciales ;  - **Rien de technique**
- du droit du travail, du droit syndical et de la sécurité sociale.  - **Rien de technique**

Restent les lois de finance et les lois de financement de la sécurité sociale, qui sont des sujets techniques mais où il y a pléthore de fonctionnaires pour aider les députés, qui de toute façon ne sont pas des spécialistes.

Enfin, les lois de programmation n'ont pas grand chose de technique, il s'agit de fixer des objectifs à l'État.

Pour conclure, tous ces domaines ne devraient pas être techniques, ils devraient être facilement compréhensibles par n'importe quel citoyen. Si les législateurs ont complexifié ces domaines, ils ont échoué et leur tâche démocratique serait de simplifier tout ce bordel.",1,1394456806,null,0,false,0,cfyxayk,t3_201hnz,t1_cfyxayk,t1_cfywzg0,null,1432736586,-3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,-3

Article 12 du même Préambule :

La garantie des droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen nécessite une force publique : cette force est donc instituée pour l'avantage de tous, et non pour l'utilité particulière de ceux auxquels elle est confiée. - **Idem : les administrateurs se servent en négligeant l'avantage de tous et dépensent à court-terme pour être réélus, c'est le marketing électoral**

et surtout le putain d'Article 15 :

**La Société a le droit de demander compte à tout Agent public de son administration.**

Deficit e' quanto aumenta il debito; in pratica, il deficit e' la differenza fra le entrate statali e le uscite. 

Siccome questo valore - di per se' - non dice molto, spesso si usa il rapporto deficit/pil, cioe' di quanto cresce il debito pubblico rispetto al prodotto interno lordo.

Si puo' garantire che questo rapporto rimanga sotto un certo valore promettendo di non aumentare il debito pubblico (tagliando spese o razzolando entrate).

Considera anche che il PIL non fluttua piu' di tanto di anno in anno.. si parla di un intervallo di variabilita' di qualche punto percentuale.

Barrierefreies TL;DR:

**Intransparenz**

Die Verhandlungen zum TTIP unterliegen der Geheimhaltung. Das Mandat der Verhandlungspartner ist weder öffentlich, noch durch das Europaparlament demokratisch legitimiert. Die Folgen des Abkommens können gewählte Parlamentarier aber auf Jahre binden. In dem Handelsabkommen werden jetzt also schon hinter verschlossenen Türen die Weichen dafür gestellt, was Parlamente in Zukunft dürfen.

**Wettbewerb**

Wettbewerbsfähigkeit ist im TTIP das dominierende Ziel. Andere Werte wie soziale und ökologische Standards müssen sich unterordnen. Wie weit die Menschen in Europa ihren Lebens- und Arbeitsraum schützen wollen, wird irrelevant, solange die Unternehmen auf beiden Seiten des Atlantiks ihre Gewinne maximieren können.

**Daseinsvorsorge**

Alle möglichen Dienstleistungen sollen nach dem TTIP liberalisiert werden. Was sich frei und harmlos anhört, bedeutet, dass auch öffentliche Dienstleistungen und Kulturangebote in Zukunft nach Rentabilität bewertet werden. Die freie Entscheidung soziale oder ökologische Standards darüber entscheiden zu lassen, wer einen Auftrag aus öffentlicher Hand erhält wird den Menschen genommen.

**Klagen**

Investitionsschutz bedeutet im Klartext neue außergerichtliche Klagemöglichkeiten für internationale Unternehmen gegen öffentliches Handeln. Vattenfall nutzt solche Klagerechte bereits gegen den Atomausstieg und Phillip Morris kämpft mit Investor-Staat-Klagen gegen Regeln zum Gesundheitsschutz.

**Agrarindustrie**

Die Verbraucherschutzstandards für Lebensmittel sind in Europa deutlich strenger als in den USA. Weder gentechnisch veränderte Pflanzen noch mit Chlor oder Wachstumshormonen belastetes Fleisch dürfen in Europa verkauft werden. Sollten in einem Handelsabkommen die Sicherheitsstandards der USA anerkannt werden, wäre dieser Schutz weg.

**Lobby**

Das TTIP soll neue transatlantische Institutionen für regulatorische Zusammenarbeit schaffen. Diese wären nicht demokratisch legitimiert.  Mangelnde Transparenzregeln und fehlende Verantwortlichkeiten machen solche Gremien anfällig für massiven Einfluss durch Lobbyisten.

**Energie**
Durch umwelt- und klimaschädliches „Fracking“ ist die USA in den letzten Jahren zu einem Exporteur für Erdgas geworden. Nach dem TTIP würde sich den US-Energieunternehmen in Europa ein großer Markt öffnen – ihre gefährlichen Fördermethoden würden lukrativer.

**Urheberrecht**

Urheberrechte sind jetzt schon in Europa und den USA sehr strikt geregelt. Nach dem Abkommen soll das Urheberrecht noch weiter verschärft werden. Gerade im Bereich Wissen, in der medizinischen Forschung oder bei Patenten auf Saatgut, gibt es aber gute Gründe, geistiges Eigentum der Gemeinschaft zugänglich zu machen.",0,1394457942,null,0,false,0,cfyxlq2,t3_2019p0,t1_cfyxlq2,t3_2019p0,null,1432736728,10,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,10

Ansonsten ist der Artikel peinlich, weil falsche Informationen kund getan werden und auch schlecht argumentiert wird. Zum Falschen:

- Die Beschneidung ist nicht konstititutiv fuer das Judentum. Es gibt viele juedische Sowjetrussen, die nicht beschnitten sind, weil es damals verboten war. Es ist eine der 613 Mitzwot (religioese Pflichten), die man als glaeubiger Jude zu erfuellen hat.

- Es gibt Rabbis, die anderer Ansicht sind, was Beschneidung angeht (keine Vorhaut ab, sondern es muss zumindest ein bisschen Blut flieszen, quasi wie es jetzt schon bei bereits beschnittenen Gerim ist), was angesichts der klaren Worte in der ""Bibel"", wie der Artikel die Torah nennt, doch etwas befremdlich ist. Gut, darueber kann man sicherlich theologisch diskutieren, aber was mich am meisten stoert ist die schlechte Argumentation:

&gt; Wenn man die Bibel tatsächlich für Gottes Wort hält, muss man schlussfolgernd auch dieses Gebot ernst nehmen.

Aus Wiki:

Die Strafe ist von der jährlichen Steuerschuld abhängig (Bundesgerichtshof, Az: 1 StR 416/08); danach ist die Steuerhinterziehung mit ähnlichen Strafen wie Betrug behaftet. Der Steuerschaden ist maßgeblich für die Strafzumessung.

    Bis 50.000 Euro werden normalerweise Geldstrafen verhängt.
    Ab 50.000 Euro kann auch eine Freiheitsstrafe (auf Bewährung) verhängt werden. Ab dieser Schadenshöhe ist zudem regelmäßig ein besonders schwerer Fall gemäß § 370 Abs. 3 S. 2 Nr. 1 AO gegeben (vgl. BGH, Beschluss vom 15. Dezember 2011 – 1 StR 579/11).
    Ab 100.000 Euro sollte in der Regel eine Freiheitsstrafe verhängt werden.
    Ab 1.000.000 Euro ist eine bewährungsfähige Strafe (bis einschließlich zwei Jahre Freiheitsstrafe) nur noch bei Vorliegen von ""besonders gewichtigen Milderungsgründen""[1] zu verhängen.

true,JasonYamel,UKRA,Ukraine,"&gt;Dude, I didn't link to any misrepresentation by anyone, I linked to the leaked call.

As I said, the leaked call itself is a misrepresentation **by** Estonian FM **of** a conversation he claims he had.

&gt;Of course not, and yet he used the term and it's clear what he means.

Not to me.

&gt;This should be an investigation by an independent organisation such as OSCE. There's no way in hell Prosecutor General Oleh Makhnitskyi would ever announce investigation results that incriminate those in power today.

Sure, I have no problem with that. If you notice who's blocking OSCE observers and investigators these days, it isn't the Ukrainian government. And they should let them investigate the massacre too.

&gt;First of all the hypothesis is a very plausible one. It is known that extreme right members did participate in the protest and pushed for them to become violent.

It is an outrageous claim and as such it requires very strong evidence to be put forth. ""Right wingers were present"" is not evidence, especially  since they were very restrained in using guns, and only used them once the police began an outright massacre (first time was on the 18th, when there were snipers visible on the roofs and 18 people died, including many shot with sniper rifles). There's no shred of evidence that the protester side had even a single sniper.

&gt;While these groups incited violence, Yanukovych on the other hand had no interest in escalating the situation further. (Not to mention even if he wanted to, at the very least he wouldn't be shooting his own policemen since he can just order them to be violent, so at least those shots came from elsewhere).

Not all policemen were shot (many were beaten and died in the hospital), but the ones that were have all died on the 19th and 20th and again as far as I'm aware no sniper rifle rounds, just handgun and hunting rifle rounds. An investigation documenting all that would be nice, and is in progress.

&gt;The proofs were not just that the investigation hadn't started. They claimed they were refusing to investigate, which is different. 

Who's they? Ashton was listening, not talking. Paet was mistaken, no one was refusing to investigate, which even he later admitted when he said their conversation was misrepresented.

&gt;As he said, that hypothesis was becoming more and more evident.

No, he said it was becoming ""more and more prevalent"". As in, people believe that. Which, again, no they don't, and why he said what he said is his business. The medic he was talking about, Olha Bohomolets, has refuted his version of their conversation.

&gt; It's weird that he'd be so specific and taking seriously something completely baseless.

I still fail to see how what one guy says on the phone can be considered evidence when even his story and accounts of conversations he had do not check out, and he says he was misunderstood and that facts on the ground superseded what was said in it (on Feb 24).

&gt;Exactly, point being that claims that ""what matters is whether it gets legitimized later on, and how soon"" is rather shortsighted. People are quick to quickly legitimise whatever is convenient for them.

But the situation in the rest of Ukraine is completely different - almost 100% opposite in fact. There is enough time to hold a presidential campaign, and even more time for a Parliamentary campaign, with that election probably happening in mid-fall, and since the parliament has more powers under the restored constitution of 2004 that latter election is more important. Ukraine is completely open to the world right now, media and observers from all over will be watching both elections and reporting unimpeded about what they see (at least this is publicly declared, if it turns out not to be so, **then** you can complain about illegitimate process).",0,1394462161,null,0,false,0,cfyyxwo,t3_1zwu0p,t1_cfyyxwo,t1_cfypcqs,null,1432737395,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

And Ukraine is hugely different. It can end up being a **limited war**, which isn't something the European Union is ready for, or capable of responding too, without extensive U.S. support. 

It's not like 1970, when tensions were at a all time high and it was a zero-sum game. This can be limited, a slowly-developing conflict, that even if it goes hot, might not go nuclear. Would Russia be willing to go nuclear if they lost conventionally in Ukraine? Perhaps. 

But more importantly, **would the European Union go nuclear if they lost in a conventional war?** I don't think so. At all. Hence why if the EU launches a conventional intervention, *without U.S. support*, and they're beaten back? Well, that's it. 

Sorry. 

I don't see Europe, even France or the United Kingdom, mobilizing for total war over Ukraine, a ally neither are tightly bound too or required to defend *(I.E. Ukraine being a non-NATO ally)*.

So, all those people, and all those nukes, won't mean a god damn fucking thing if it means a non-nuclear, limited war. What matters than is a cohesive, integrated and standardized military which is properly funded and capable of power projection far from it's borders under it's own power *(I.E. Without U.S. Help)*. 

Also why China is training for fast, limited wars; because they know it's less likely to raise bring about a total war, nuclear scenario. And it's harder for America to keep up support on the Home Front when it comes to escalating a otherwise small conflict *(I.E. Chinese seizure of Filipino/Japanese islands)* into a full-blown war. 

Russia and Ukraine are working on the same principle, only thing different being Russia is a lot god damn better militarily *(I.E. Or at least more capable of projecting power)* than the Chinese, and the Europeans are much less willingly to go to war than the Americans *(Nor, it could be argued, as prepared logistically and intelligence-wise)*.

true,OWKuusinen,FINL,"Terijoki, Finland","&gt;I'm not saying it shouldn't be there - it has worked well to keep humans from living horrible lives - but it's not a freedom to take someone else's money under the threat of imprisonment if he/she won't give it.

But is it their money? If we're talking of earners, be it individuals or companies, the government has paid either their schooling or the schooling of the employees, as well as creating the opportunities under which the money was made. 

Finland, for example, is known for highly educated people (to whom you have to pay relatively little, compared to USA) and relatively non-corrupted government. These are possible because the people don't need money for college fund or for expensive insurances. To compare: before we started the wellfare state experiment in the early 1960s the most you could say about this country was that people could read and we had forests. Nokia cut lumber and made rubber tires! Needless to say that we were rather poor and there wasn't much hope that it would ever change. Now, even after the country has been in recession for 6 or 7 years we're still one of the more well-off countries on the continent. 

I see it a little like you have a recept for a cake. You use ""free"" ingredients and ""free"" oven to make the cake and are then horrified when the owner of the ingredients and oven wants his cut - even though you started with only an idea and now you have a (at most) half-eaten cake.  

People have this strange feeling that if the money was on your account even for a second then it's yours. Perhaps, if people never saw the whole cake, only the one where a cut had been taken, they would be happier. 


EDIT: Anecdote to illustrate my point: the only (successful) Finnish politician who has declared herself to be a neoliberal says that she has gotten her money on her own work, completely forgetting that she's from a relatively poor family and has two master's degrees with student allowance on top paid completely by state.

Il rapporto Deficit/Pil non è stabilito ""per decreto"" ma si basa sul rapporto tra il disavanzo dello stato (quanto le entrate superano le uscite, quindi quanto ci indebitiamo ogni anno) e il PIL. 

Per ridurre il rapporto Deficit/Pil il governo può ridurre il disavanzo (aumentando le tasse o riducendo la spesa pubblica) o aumentando il Pil con opportune manovre

Quali sono queste manovre? In questo caso l'azione avviene ""con un miglioramento dell'avanzo delle partite correnti..."". Questo termine così difficile indica la differenza tra esportazioni e importazioni di beni.

- La police. Ca c'est intéressant. Mais le facteur confondant est ici la richesse des ménages qui habitent dans les villes. En effet, il y a une grosse demande de police de la part des riches parce que ce sont eux qui ont le plus peur de se faire cambrioler et attaquer.

Do you think he can't comprehend the point being made?

He's saying the idea of a phrase being incorrect in this way is meaningless. Language is defined only by how it's used, especially fixed phrases. This phrase's pervasive usage does indeed makes it not wrong. Language does not evolve according to strict logical rules.

For example, I could be pedantic and say you should be using the subjunctive in your sentence: ""That's like saying if enough people *were to start/started*..."" Though you might object, there are in fact people who consider not using the subjunctive incorrect. But a lot of people still don't use it. There was a point in the evolution of the English subjunctive when people just like you kept complaining about its decay. What's changed now about the logic of the subjunctive and indicative tenses? Nothing, only the way people use them has changed.

To contrast this, look at how people often mistake the phrase ""for all intents and purposes"" for ""for all intensive purposes."" This is a simple mistake made when hearing a phrase for the first time and then trying to write it down.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; As I said, the leaked call itself is a misrepresentation by Estonian FM of a conversation he claims he had.

Sorry I misread this. So far the only claim I saw released Poet was:

&gt; *“I didn’t give any evaluation. I stated that this information was going around. Anyone can put together things like that. The conversation was held a week ago. But it was put up now, a week later, now when the new government in Ukraine has started work.”*

He's simply stating was not give an evaluation (which was clear as he even said no investigation had been made) and that it was one week old (so it was before the new government started working).

Nowhere does it says he was mischaracterising the information he had been given. What it implies is that some people were mischaracterising his affirmations and skewing the context. But none of that means his affirmations should be dismissed. 

&gt; Not all policemen were shot (many were beaten and died in the hospital), but the ones that were have all died on the 19th and 20th and again as far as I'm aware no sniper rifle rounds, just handgun and hunting rifle rounds. An investigation documenting all that would be nice, and is in progress.

On the one hand you claim this, on the other hand Poet after talking with people on the ground talks about *""a stronger and stronger understanding that behind the snipers it was not Yanukovych but somebody from the new coalition""* why should I believe any of us to be more well informed than he was. 

It's irrelevant what any of us is aware of until there is an independent investigation taking place. And so far, independent investigations, there was none and it seems like they won't take place.  

&gt; The medic he was talking about, Olha Bohomolets, has refuted his version of their conversation.

First of all she didn't refute his version. She said a doctor wouldn't be able to evaluate whether bullets in two bodies are from the same shooter or not. 

Also it amazes me that some are happy to take public declarations at face value, over private leaked conversations. Talk about having a bias. *""Oh yeah they got caught saying that, but now in public people have told that's not true so... I guess that's it, everything's clear now"". Surely you'd have the same attitude had it been a leaked call from Russians. 

Again, show me the results of an independent investigation and I'll be happy with it. Up until then all we got is propaganda by both sides. 

&gt;  No, he said it was becoming ""more and more prevalent"". As in, people believe that. 

No need to nitpick over words when we can just quote him. He said *""a stronger and stronger understanding""*. And in the very beginning he started by using the word ""evidence"". So those were his words. 

&gt; and he says he was misunderstood and that facts on the ground superseded what was said in it (on Feb 24).

This is really frustrating. 

He's very specific as to what he said was being misunderstood. The call is there for you to listen to. And I just pasted his quote.

The nazis enslaved people based on ethnicity and the non-enslaved ethnicity still lived in dire conditions in a poor social infrastructure. The nazis blamed this on their country's recent economical and political history, but the truth is that they didn't have any plans to develop their social state. This blame shifting was all part of the fascist propaganda methods of enticing nationalism through a common sense of national pride, which in this case was hurt and had to be fixed at all costs, especially at the cost of the social state of the non-enslaved ethnicities.

Fascists the first ones to call themselves socialists, because historically socialism was their enemy and this purposeful confusion is what has made people side with fascists thinking ""oh, these guys are cool, they're not like those commienazis, they're just fascists"" time and time again.

I do not and will not ever attempt to make excuses for those crimes that were committed. It would be a tragedy if people would forget what happened, because that creates a chance that they make the same mistake again.

But can't you see how it does nothing for either side if you see today's Germany and its 80 Million inhabitants as nothing but descendants of Nazis? Aren't you aware that the vast majority of civilians had no part in the mass killings (which does not excuse the general persecution and alienation)? That there were many families risking their lives in support of Jewish friends and partners? That there wasn't a single democratic election, despite Hitler's and Goebbel's propaganda, even long before the deportations started, where a majority of Germans voted for the NSDAP? That around 77 000 non-Jewish German citizens were killed for opposing the NDSAP's agenda of racism and hate?

Even if you're eager to forget all of that and regard 1933's Germany as nation of 98,96% Nazis, it's simply ignorant to claim their grandchildren should feel personally guilty.

It seems kind of inappropriate to act like Germany is a nation of war profiteers. The Jewish population was (and to a lesser degree still is) an essential part of Germany.  

My grandfather on my father's side was drafted into the Wehrmacht in 1941 and shot in the head in Russia (he was lucky to survive and sent back home, otherwise he would've died like the vast majority of Wehrmacht soldiers fighting in Russia). My father had cut contact to his parents (and I supported that decision) because they had denied that his father voted for the NSDAP during the last ""democratic"" elections. On my mother's side, my grandmother's family in Danzig/Gdansk was murdered by NS soldiers because they were friends with a Jewish family and hid them when the deportations started. It's not like the average German had a marvelous pastime happily murdering Jews in his backyard.

&gt; They should be ashamed and guilty until the end of their time as a nation, not 2014 but in 3014 they should still remember and feel sorry for what they did as the collective known as Germans. 

Remember and feel sorry? Definitely. Accept personal responsibility for crimes they didn't commit? Unrealistic. You inherit neither the good nor the bad deeds of your parents.

You again misread me. I didn't say that **he** acknowledged misrepresenting the conversation he had with the doctor who is mentioned in the phone call. He identified the doctor as Olha Bohomolets. The doctor herself, [refuted Paet's account](http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/03/5/7017758/)

&gt;Водночас доктор Ольга Богомолець також прокоментувала цю розмову: ""За весь час протистоянь в Києві я не мала доступу до загиблих правоохоронців, тому не могла коментувати характер їхніх поранень"".
""Я лікар, а не судовий медичний експерт для того, щоб давати такого роду оцінки"", - зазначила вона.
""18-20 лютого мені довелося спілкуватися з величезною кількістю людей і складно зараз згадати всіх і особливо, про що ми тоді говорили. Але згадану тему точно не обговорювала по телефону, і ніколи не обговорюю політичні теми по телефону"", - додала Богомолець.

At the same time doctor Olha Bohomolets also commented on this conversation: ""At no time during the conflict in Kiev did I have access to the deceased policemen, so I could not have commented on the nature of their wounds"". ""I am a doctor, and not a forensic pathologist, so cannot give assessments of this kind"" she said. ""On the 18-20 of February I have spoken to a huge number of people and it is difficult now to remember everyone, and especially the content of every conversation. But this topic I certainly did not discuss over the phone, and I never discuss politics over the phone,"" Bohomolets added.

&gt;Also it amazes me that some are happy to take public declarations at face value, over private leaked conversations. Talk about having a bias. *""Oh yeah they got caught saying that, but now in public people have told that's not true so... I guess that's it, everything's clear now"". Surely you'd have the same attitude had it been a leaked call from Russians.

What amazes me, in turn, is that someone would take what is basically an unfounded rumour based on not a shred of actual evidence, containing numerous inaccuracies, and refuted by the supposed source of that rumour, and claim that it is some big bombshell. 

And if that's all the Russians could come up with while listening to everyone's phone conversations, even over special lines like the Paet-Ashton call, it also tells you a whole lot.

&gt;I didn't say the situation wasn't different, I said your affirmation made no sense. The fact that the affirmation would fit something completely different in a context you don't agree, shows you should have put some more thought into it.

If a legitimate referendum was held in a fair and transparent manner in, say, 6 months, even if it was not strictly speaking constitutional, would be a legitimization of something I completely disagree with and wish would not happen, but could no longer argue against on the basis of it being not legitimate. So your point doesn't make much sense - I am all in favour of people deciding their own fate, and my complaint isn't against the idea of a referendum in Crimea but about how it is being faked.

Of course we care, it's just Russia as country was so powerless in the 90's and to show you that I mentioned things we couldn't prevent because of that:

1. Genocide of ethnic Russian minorities in Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and Chechnya which our government failed to prevent either by sending troops or forcing evacuation. 

2. We lost sovereignty over our traditional territories: Northern Kazakhstan, Belarus, Ukraine (except Western part: Lwow and Wolyn), Transnistria, parts of Lithuania and Letonia.

3. We lost strategic military bases, Baikanur, corridor to Kaliningrad, military equipment and thousands of foreign contracts and credit rights, not to mention the famous brain drain.

Then there was a continuous economic crisis due to bad macroeconomic politics which were imposed to Russian government and a war in Chechnya. Russian government couldn't do anything to help Serbians more than it already did, yet thousand of Russian voluntaries went there to aid our brothers.

I am not sure how I will vote in the UK general election 2015 yet. The Conservatives will put a referendum in their manifesto, but it still isn't certain what the Labour party will do. Also, there is a chance that legislation for the referendum is passed in this parliament. A vote for UKIP in the general election has been seen as wasted vote in the past, but arguably that is now changing.

A referendum on UK's membership of the EU will answer that particular question, but whichever way it goes, other questions will arise. If we vote ""out"" how do we organise our future relationship with the EU, and indeed the rest of the world? If we vote ""in"", again, how do we manage our relationship with the rest of the EU (and in particular the eurozone) as it moves towards federalism, without us?

true,OWKuusinen,FINL,"Terijoki, Finland","&gt;About making choices, being gay, adoption etc.

Sorry to hear about the Danish legistlation concerning gays, but we were talking about taxation and money. The suburbian utopia is one example, your freedom to travel and ""enjoy other aspects"" is another. Common to both is that they would be hard to make true without money. And for most, well-paying job means education (which is very expensive business to pay on your own, ask Americans).

Very few people in the world want to place themselves in a situation where they have few choices. To get back to my earlier rant about landless farmers and their offspring - without welfare state there wouldn't have been any choice between what their offspring would do - now they can educate themselves and become doctors - if they so wish. 

I'd add that even if said offspring were gay, welfare state gives them more opportunities to find and be true to themselves. Being able to marry or adopt is an important part of that equation, but hardly the whole picture. It also includes stuff like sexual education that acknowledges that not everybody is born hetero and assures us that this is ok. This doesn't mean just you personally know that gay is ok, but all the heteros around you as well. As I'm sure you know, this isn't self-evident. The views toward gays are harsher there where such education isn't given (and life is pretty sucky for heteros as well). 

&gt;Alas, I pay 56+8% in taxes to support other people's life choices.

Examples? But generally speaking, welfare state is a package deal. You get stuff you don't view that you need, even though perhaps you need them indirectly - stuff like child benefits may be useless to you directly, but they are indirectly very important as you are part of a society that needs children.

&gt;That's not freedom. It's just majority dictatorship.

It's also not freedom if we didn't have any sort of progressive taxation. Then money (and with it, power) would concentrate on few families who could do pretty much anything with those landless farmers. 

Nobody in society is completely free (and define freedom as the ability to make choices). The trick is finding a situation where most people can fulfill their dreams ""well enough"". 10 room apartment in downtown Copenhagen is a nice dream, but an 7 room apartment in Copenhagen isn't much worse as far as living standards go. As you know, each additional unit of something increases value only logarithmically while the price of getting it grows exponentially. Those missing two rooms might get whole apartments to people who would go without. That's an immense gain to them and only low gain to you -- and anyway, without chances like that, Copenhagen wouldn't be very desirable place to live in the first place, what with the homeless problem and all!",0,1394471612,null,0,1394472044,0,cfz2xmp,t3_1zz7lb,t1_cfz2xmp,t1_cfz10np,null,1432739278,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Who's *them*? Whose own territory? Chechens already have their autonomous republic. They have their president there and receive generous support from Moscow. Who are you talking about when you say *them*? The militants hiding out in the mountains? Can you tell me, exactly how can a group that plants [car bombs](http://www.columbian.com/news/2014/jan/17/9-wounded-by-car-bomb-in-russias-dagestan/) represent the interests of the people? They are just fringe radicals, sponsored by Saudi oil sheiks, with ties to Al Quaeda and the radicals in Syria. They do not want *their own territory*, they want to conquer a [big chunk of land between the Black Sea and the Caspian](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Caucasus_Emirate.svg), ethnically cleanse the whole region and a establish a Sharia state, with Doku Umarov as its undisputed leader. There is NOTHING democratic or freedom-bringing about their aims. They already had their *own territory* some 15 years ago, and back then they just invaded Russia, to spread their fucked up ideology. I really don't get it. What is your justification in handing over Chechnya to a bunch of murderous fanatics that do not represent any sizable chunk of population in Chechnya and whose basic objective is to wage this war with Russia until there is no-one left?

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Neither condition will be fulfilled within a month and a half or two of hard economic sanctions.

But who's to say the Russian people will turn and blame Putin and the oligarchy for that. Their media will portray it as the west imposing harsh economic sanctions against them. It will portray the EU/USA as the aggressors and ordinary Russians the victims (no doubt Putin the strongman saviour). And for what the Russians might ask? For saving ethnic Russians from an illegitimate Ukrainian government (think of they would phrase this)?

There's also the difficulty of being reliant on the Russian economy. Take the UK. We import some gas from Russia, that would hurt us. Two, BP are invested in Russia, so one of our big companies would take a hit (don't know how many other companies as well). Three, the UK pension is invested to an extent in BP, so that would take a hit. Four is general confidence in the City of London, our core industry. If the government are willing to alienate Russian investors when the UK doesn't like Russia, will that make people lose confidence in the City? Cumulatively that makes a lot of different problems the UK government and people will face in trying to do this. Our government would need some strong public support for this, something I doubt would be forthcoming. Poland, given their history with Russia, is an entirely different beast.

Then there's Putin's reaction. Lets assume sanctions are imposed in a clear attempt to destabilise Russia (do we want a severely unstable Russia? That's a factor unto itself). Does Putin seem like the type to take it laying down, or is he likely to turn it up a notch? And how? Economic sanctions are one thing, but if it went military then are we willing to risk that? It would look mighty bad for us to be big and strong risking our economy, only to back down when the troops are needed. Selling sanctions is one thing.

Not entirely true. It depends on when you book the tickets (for both train / airplane). F. ex. on Christmas last year I had to go from Hamburg to Frankfurt. The ICE train ticket was about 90 Euros (early reservation) and the Lufthansa direct flight was 55 Euros (+ it was of course much faster). So OP, check the Lufthansa / Germanwings / Air Berlin websites if you are planning your trip in advance. 

But u/dirkt is right about the short distance trips - the ""Regionalbahn"" is quite cheap and comfortable and especially in Northrhine-Westfalia = NRW (Aachen, Köln, Düsseldorf, Münster) doesn't take much longer than the highspeed trains (ICE, IC). Plus: You don't need to buy tickets in advance (it's always the same price, so you can be spontaneous).

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"With respect to your first paragraph, I don't really know what to argue except that I don't think the propaganda will in any way negate the effect on Russians. You have to remember, people in Russia desire stability more than anything else. They still vividly recall the fucked up economic situation during and following shock therapy in the 90s, where the economy was even more fucked up than in the final years of the Soviet Union. It won't matter who caused it, what will matter is that this illusion will be removed, and it will have been removed by Putin's actions, regardless of how legitimate many Russians view it as.

&gt;There's also the difficulty of being reliant on the Russian economy. Take the UK. We import some gas from Russia, that would hurt us. Two, BP are invested in Russia

Not anymore. BP-TNK was sold to Rosneft (and BP was very very glad to get rid of it, given the myriad problems Putin's regime created for them). As to the energy reserves, the point isn't that they'll stop indefinitely. Norway and North Africa can kick production up a notch for the meantime, and regardless all EU countries have to have a one month reserve of gas by law. This also removes your issues with the City and BP.

As to confidence with Russia - it depends on the level of sanctions. You're imagining full and comprehensive long term economic isolation, and I never suggested that was the case. Rather, that they should be put in place to pressure putin. It would just take a little time for the sanctions to begin affecting Russia, and Putin certainly doesn't want to see the country imperilled, nor his regime. He'll play ball with the West, and the West will probably ask Ukraine to make Crimea more autonomous or some such to satisfy the Russians back home. With respect to the influence on Putin, I've also stated in the past that the West's biggest problem if they impose sanctions will be giving Putin an 'out'. Something to make him seem like he won, or at least drew, as happened with Syria.

 And the hit from Russia wouldn't be that big, it's not as if Russian money makes the City run. I doubt Russia would even account for a twentieth of the capital flows in London (and that's a high-estimate). Regardless, visa and residency restrictions on the oligarchs would make them the hardest hit in this case as they tend to live in the west (and they have great sway on Putin as a whole, particularly with public resentment). 

Regardless, I think you're ignoring the cost to the West of inaction. First, it delegitimizes many aspects of international law and custom that have been broadly held up over the past few decades. It's by no means perfect, nor always upheld, but this show of weakness by the West will destablize the international order. Second, it completely fucks up the NPT. If the West wasn't willing to bat for a country that gave up it's nukes, then no country without nukes is safe, and soon we'll have runaway nuclear proliferation. Just think of what Iran could now say about it's nuclear program, and it would allow neighbouring states to follow suit, particularly if they think Iran is going to get the bomb.

Let me be clear that I have nothing against Russian people generally, and while the following comments will be harsh, when I refer to ""Russia"" I mean the Russian government as a political entity and not every person of Russian nationality, origin, descent, etc.

The history of Russia and Ukraine largely consists of Russia either controlling Ukraine or badly wanting to.  Only 22 years ago, Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, which in my opinion was the worst thing to ever happen to Ukraine, as the Soviet government was oppressive and violent in the extreme, not respecting human rights or dignity.  The KGB, of which Putin was an officer, was one of the tools of this repression.  Given Putin's history in that organization, there are plenty of Ukrainians, myself included, who see Putin and his current government as the old Russian imperialist power by another name that would like nothing more than to control Ukraine again.

This, in my opinion, is why the Euromaidan protests broke out in the first place.  The trade deal with Europe was seen as a great opportunity to escape the domineering influence of Russia, as my personal feeling has been that while Russia hadn't invaded Ukraine by that point, it resented Ukraine's independence.  Thus, when Yanukovych not only rejected the deal with the EU at the last minute, but went straight into the arms of Putin, Ukrainians lost it.  Yanukovych, whom many Ukrainians still mistrusted after the Orange Revolution of 2004, was seen as a corrupt, thuggish sell-out who was making Ukraine more dependent on Russia for the sake of his own gain.  As everyone suspected, when his palace was taken over this year it was confirmed that he had been milking Ukraine dry and making himself rich.  Before the trade deal fiasco, everyone knew that corruption, cronyism, and incompetence ran deep in the Ukrainian government, and they could live with that for a while, but Yanukovych's move was the straw that broke the camel's back, as it was seen by those passionate for Ukrainian independence as a thinly disguised threat to Ukraine's (de facto, if not eventually de jure) independence.

Right now, watching Russian troops march onto Ukrainian territory unopposed, I am livid.  Yesterday, I was watching the excellent reporting of Simon Ostrovsky of Vice News, where he interviewed Ukrainian officers who were held at gunpoint and told to surrender, or offered bribes for defection by Russian officers, etc.  and was nearly screaming ""How dare they?"" at my computer.  I am amazed that the Ukrainian troops have had the balls to take the abuse and humiliation and not fire a shot, but at the same time they have every right to.  In any case, as if we didn't already know that we can't trust Russia, this whole invasion is a complete violation of its agreement to respect the borders of Ukraine, ""Russian-speaking majority"" in Crimea or not.  Furthermore, Putin's claims of ""protecting Russian citizens and ethnic Russians"" in Ukraine are BS, as their lives were never in danger in the first place.  The current government in Kiev consists of mostly the same MP's, with the exception of Yanukovych and his closest cronies, as were in Parliament before the protests began.  The claims that ""radical fascists have taken over the government and are a threat to Russians in Ukraine"" are hogwash.  Also, Putin's claim that his troops are there to ""stabilize the situation"" are BS as well.  If his troops are doing anything they are escalating - blockading Ukrainian troops in their bases and so on.  Ukraine has every right to fire on these men walking around in unmarked uniforms carrying Russian guns and driving Russian vehicles.  It is only because they want peace rather than war that they haven't.  Giving up Crimea to Russia is out of the question, as that would only give them ideas that they can manufacture another excuse and march troops in somewhere else and take that too.  In this staring contest, Russia has to be the one to blink.  And of course, that referendum that only includes options for greater autonomy for Crimea or joining Russia and doesn't include an option to stay with Ukraine as it is is completely unconstitutional and bogus.

I think you may be aiming at another thread. Nobody here is talking about anybody abandoning anything. I was saying that the EU macroprudental framework which was implemented in 2011 needed to have been written in to the maastricht treaty in the first place. Same goes for two-policy-goal concept. 

The ECB was set up along the lines of the Bundesbank. It should have been set up along the lines of the Bank of England or the Bank of France instead. 

I find it wholly insufficient that now, years after the Euro has run into huge problems, we are all going back and saying...""*oh yeah, we forgot to think about the CB's stimulatory role or about financial/bank regulation....duh*"". 

We had all partners on board in 1992 when they made the maastricht treaty. Back then, one of the main concerns is ""how can we make sure it doesn't go wrong"".  In those days, macroprudential regulation was the latest buzzword. How it didn't get included into the treaty is beyond me. 

&gt; Abandon each military, 

Dude, Not what this conversation is about. at all.

Bad news: they reason they're looking for teachers is often because they're assholes to work for and people walk out. Pay is low, hours are intermittent (""we'll start you on five hours a week and see how it goes""). 

Other concerns: some schools will never give you more than 20 hours a week because beyond that you get some kind of labor rights, which they want to avoid. 

Also, many schools have several venues in different parts of the city (including corporate and institutional clients) and may want to send you around the place, and you'll need to rely on public transport to get there. They do not pay you for travelling time. When I taught English I got paid €10 an hour (I'm unqualified), but only when I was teaching - about 4 hours a day. The rest of the day was spent traveling, and I was out of the house for around 12 hours a day, most of it spent traveling around the city on buses, not being paid. It sucked.

Finally, though most are OK there are a few schools that don't manage their finances properly, and are unreliable in paying staff, either through incompetence or dishonesty. In the worst case I know of, an entire school just disappeared last year, taking with it the staff's salaries and the customers' money. 

Good luck - definitely blast every school in Rome and compare all of those who offer you a job before deciding.

In fact, for a very long time Russia avoided building pipelines to China because they were holding out to get around the spot price on gas in China, but with China quickly gaining leverage in Central Asia (where previously, pretty much every pipeline led west) that rapidly changed and now Russia is happy to take whatever it can get. 

Regardless, it's not as if Russia could quickly retool all those fields to send them to China, or that China would take it without the serious discount on European prices it's been seeking for ages, so that's not an alternative for Russia either.

More importantly than army expenses being 16% of the budget, however, is that Gazprom alone supplies over 20% of the government's revenue.

true,Not_here_to_be_nice,NRW,Nordrhein-Westfalen,"&gt;Lieber Herr Heiser,

&gt;Ihr Klagelied hat nichts, aber auch gar nichts mit dem alten oder einem neuen Urheberrecht zu tun. Wenn Sie einen Anwalt beauftragen, der Ihnen zu Ihrem Recht verhelfen soll, müssen Sie ihn erst einmal bezahlen. Wenn der Anwalt für Sie Klage erhebt und Sie dann den Prozess gewinnen, muss die Gegenseite die eigenen und Ihre Anwaltskosten sowie die Gerichtskosten in vollem Umfang tragen. Das Risiko ist nur, dass Sie zum Beispiel hinsichtlich Ihrer Schadensersatzforderung zu viel verlangen und dann auf einem Teil der Kosten sitzen bleiben, wenn das Gericht Ihnen nur teilweise recht gibt.

&gt;Wenn Sie sich vergleichen, wie es hier wohl geschehen ist, müssen Sie ebenfalls einen Teil der Kosten, zum Beispiel die eigenen Anwaltskosten, tragen. Das gilt nicht nur im Urheberrecht, sondern allgemein. Offensichtlich haben Sie einem Vergleich mit diesem Inhalt zugestimmt. Also was regen Sie sich auf? Dass Ihr Anwalt zu viel verdient? Der hat offenbar sehr kulant nach der geltenden Gebührentabelle abgerechnet. Wollen Sie ihm den ihm zustehenden Lohn für seine Arbeit nicht gönnen?

&gt;Es gilt schon immer: Recht ist eine teure Resource.

&gt;Das aber ist streng zu trennen von den Regelungen des Urheberrechts. Wenn das Urheberrecht Ihnen einen höheren Schadensersatz zubilligen würde, würden auch die Rechtsverfolgungskosten steigen.

&gt;Ihr Verlangen, dass die Urheber mehr bekommen sollen als die Anwälte, ist in dieser allgemeinen Form unrealistisch und gesetzlich überhaupt nicht regelbar. Gerade bei relativ geringen Streitwerten wie hier sind die Kosten notwendiger Weise sehr hoch im Verhältnis zum Streitwert. Geht es um größere Beträge, sind Anwalts- und Gerichtskosten im Verhältnis zum Streitwert deutlich niedriger. Aber auch das hat mit dem Urheberrecht überhaupt nichts zu tun.

&gt;Ihre so einfach daher geredete Forderung dass die Urheber mehr bekommen müssten als die Anwälte, ist also nicht zu Ende gedacht und in dieser Form einfach dumm.

&gt;Das geltende Urheberrecht ist gerade bei der Abgeltung und Ahndung von Urheberrechtsverletzungen durchaus streng gegenüber dem Verletzer. Also was wollen Sie konkret daran ändern? Wollen Sie eine Preisliste für jede denkbare Art einer Urheberrechtsverletzung ins Gesetz schreiben? Das Gesetz würde mehrere 1000 Seiten umfassen und niemand würde sich mehr darin auskennen und alle denkbaren Fälle wären auch dann noch nicht geregelt. Eine solche Forderung ist also Blödsinn.

&gt;Das Urheberrecht, gerade das deutsche, ist ganz überwiegend ein fairer Ausgleich zwischen Werkschöpfern und Werknutzern. Dass im einzelnen ständig daran gearbeitet wird, es zu verbessern, insbesondere es neuen Nutzungsgegebenheiten anzupassen, zeigt, dass alle Beteiligten eine faire Lösung anstreben, auch wenn die Interessen häufig sehr gegenläufig sind.

&gt;So platte, undifferenzierte und populistische Forderungen aufzustellen wie Sie, ist billig, dabei durchaus kontraproduktiv und führt ins Leere – außer Sie gewinnen dabei eine persönliche Genugtuung, Ihre Meinung geäußert zu haben. In der Diskussion um das Urheberrecht führen solche Reden aber nicht weiter. Ich empfehle – wie das bekannte Warnschild fordert – vor dem Reden das Gehirn einschalten.

&gt;Die Kommentare, die Ihren Artikel lobend, belegen nur die Unkenntnis der Schreiber und reflektieren eigentlich nur dumpfe Besserwisserei bei vollkommener Unkenntnis.

I currently do not have a work permit because from what I heard, you can't get one unless you have a job. Which I can only get once I am there. One of the problems I want to overcome, is the low pay/scam schools. I hear that they are common traps for people who are unqualified. This is why I figured that having the CELTA and BA would be much better for me. 

I should also mention that my friend probably had a lot of success because she tutored privately and illegally. She said that an underground economy is more than common there and she had no problems. Especially since she left the EU and came back every 3 months to get her passport stamped.

Having a mandatory military service keeps the youth unemployment lower as of February is at 59%. If you are in your military service you don't count as unemployed. plus you don't have to hire permanent personnel and you only have to pay a salary of 8 euros per month.

Cutting from salaries and pensions and the cost of 8 euros from mandatory military service compared to the weapon contracts of billions is like a drop in the ocean.

I have a friend with a CELTA who arrived two weeks ago and started work on Monday. I think she is getting between €12 and €15 an hour, but again only about 5 hours a day. Working for one school alone, you can expect to take home between €800 and €1,000 a month. 

For private lessons you can charge €25 or upwards (some people manage to charge €30 or even €45) and of course that's tax-free, but you need to work your network to achieve this sort of thing.

Working in a school is a good way to make contacts for private lessons, but again be warned: a guy I met was getting private clients from his school, and the school was suspicious so sent in an 'undercover' student who caught him soliciting. They busted him and threatened him with a €500,000 lawsuit so he had to leave and of course they retained his final month's salary.

The other problem I've had with private students is they're unreliable - they don't have any incentive to continue classes so they drop out all the time (or just don't turn up - meaning they don't pay you even though you go to meet them). Schools charge for blocks of classes in advance, but that's difficult to ask for when you're starting out doing private teaching. Try posting an ad on wantedinrome.com and seeing what happens.

However my friends and I are all EU citizens. I think you might find a larger (but not insurmountable) barrier without a permit. Like you say, the black economy is thriving, and I do know a couple of Americans who are just here on tourist visas but earning some form of money 'in nero'. Not that I condone this sort of thing. But if you want to pay tax here, you need a *codice fiscale* which I don't think they'll give you without a contract, and most schools are very reluctant indeed to give out employment contracts. 

As for cost of living, you can get a room in a shared apartment for about €400 plus bills, maybe less, and supermarkets are cheap so if you cook for yourself you'll just about get by. A monthly transport ticket is only €35. Going out socializing is going to be a bigger hit, you're looking at about €5 for a beer in a bar and €20 per person for a reasonable meal with wine. Beer in supermarkets is incredibly cheap though, and wine is cheaper than water.",0,1394479079,null,0,false,0,cfz6jrj,t3_202bqh,t1_cfz6jrj,t1_cfz65vk,null,1432741050,3,false,roma,t5_2t0su,3

Most of those packages never left Germany and went straight to the German industry maily Krupp (steal) and HDW Werft Kiel (those guys produced the submarines that Greece bought because of their pseudo-Greek-Turkish arms race)

Germany didn't enforce changes to the Greek military budget because it would have endangered the bilateral treaties about new vehicles (like I said those were mainly submarines and other ships).  However since you can't tell the German public that the government is donating billions to the German military sector they hid those sums in those famous care packages. So now our newspapers could write xenophobe bullshit like [this one](http://www.bild.de/politik/wirtschaft/teuer/deal-mit-kieler-hdw-werft-perfekt-11883902.bild.html) and the government had the once-in-a-lifetime possibility to hide donations to the most disgusting industry.    
You probably didn't read about this because it our newspapers blamed it on the ~~je~~...Greek rather than addressing the truth that our country made a lot of money out of those treaties. Stricter regulations would have endangered contracts with German companies which might have led to firing workers.

Yes, that is the theory. But does it work? Did Greece develop enough high-tech industries to support itself after 30 years of subsidies? Or did it just create dependency on subsidies?

Right now, Germany is doing well competing with the Chinese, but if you are forced into a confrontation with China/Russia due to your transatlantic commitments, that'll be the end of it. In the current crisis, the EU is serving merely as a front for transatlantic interests (Nato East expansion, oil corporations, etc.).

Germany is like China, you can win the trade but you cannot win the war.

And you can forget all about demographics. It's technology that counts! That is also the difference between China (526,412 patent applications) and India (42,291 patent applications).

There are tons of archaeological dig sites in France, who take volunteers. I studied archeology. I have a ""Licence"" in archeology. I dug every summer, and the sites were eager for more volunteers, and missing personnel.

There are at least 100 planned archaeological dig sites in France every summer which take people, students, amateurs, and foreigners. It's extremely easy to get in. 

OP might need to wait a couple months until the list of archeological digs in France for this summer is available.

Here is last year's list : http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/Disciplines-et-secteurs/Archeologie/Sur-le-terrain/Chantiers-de-benevoles

On the right hand side of the webpage, you can click to look at a PDF of a list of all digs which accepted volunteers in 2013, with the contact information of the chief archeologists who are all eagerly awaiting emails from potential volunteers. In a couple months, on this website, the list for the 2014 summer digs will be available.

The only downside of being a volunteer is that you're not paid. However, you're housed and fed. Also, I've done about 15 summer digs like this in my life. Half of the time you end up having a great time, getting girls, partying every night after a long tiring day digging a fascinating site. The other half of the time you end up in a boring group, in a possibly uninteresting dig site. It all depends on luck. 

So OP, unless your students want to be paid, you should definitely promote a dig site in France! If you need any help, just PM me, and I'll walk you through the process of how to be accepted as a volunteer. But it's basically just writing email ""motivation letters"" to the archaeologists in charge of the chosen dig sites. What's most important is that the volunteer needs to really be interested in participating in such a project. The archeologist needs to be convinced that the volunteer has a passion for archeology, or the time period (prehistory, roman era, middle ages..etc..) of the site. He doesn't need to be an expert.

Merci pour tes remarques.

Effectivement, je vais certainement mentionner l'inspiration initiale du projet par reddit et /r/france dans la FAQ. Si tu vois d'autres points concernant reddit à y mentionner n'hésites pas à m'en faire part.


&gt; Par ailleurs, sauf erreur de ma part, il n'y a pas eu de retour sur les conseils donnés lorsque tu as demandé quelles fonctionnalités non présentes sur reddit nous aimerions voir implémentées sur comigoo. 

J'ai fait [un premier retour pour la version 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1qyz20/update_jai_cr%C3%A9%C3%A9_un_reddit_like_fran%C3%A7ais_voici_la/) concernant le design et je compte faire de même avec les nouvelles fonctionnalités dès que la version 3 sera en place.
J'essaie de regrouper les changements par lots pour aboutir à de véritables évolutions et non pas des petites retouches. ça prend donc du temps de tout réaliser mais vos avis sont bien pris en compte et il y'aura bien un retour comme pour la V2. 


&gt; Enfin, dernier point, quelle est la politique de comigoo concernant les données personnelles des utilisateurs conservées dans les logs serveur ?

Les données personnelles des utilisateurs sont considérées comme des données sensibles certaines sont même cryptées (comme le mot de passe) et la politique est donc de les protéger. Elle ne sont en aucun cas divulguées sans raisons légales.

true,e1821e,GREE,Greece,"So here's how it goes, for the uninitiated to Greek matters.

/u/YannisBab is Yannis Baboulias, the author of this article. I'm not violating any rules because he is the one disclosing his identity and uses the same username on Reddit, Medium and Twitter. He's a Greek that lives in London and always relies on second hand information. He writes for the new media started by people who previously worked for ""the establishment"" without any complaints. Many of them were fired. These media are used by the opposition in their propaganda war. This means that when Greece has a problem, this problem is immediately magnified 100x by them, in a pointless point scoring. This time he went too far, he even editorialized his own title to jump into conclusions. But there's a path between journalistic populism and government or opposition propaganda. More on that below.

Greece belongs to a geographic area receiving a large migratory wave. It is very convenient for some  countries to lecture others when their infrastucture is under a lighter load. Yes, the conditions are not ideal. But most of these people are illegal immigrants. Here it is again: they entered the country illegally, usually via Turkey. Of course, this doesn't mean they should be denied of their basic human rights. But if a hospital was designed to take care of 60 people and is forced to accept 200 because of the moronic Dublin regulations, this doesn't mean that Greece should be forced to deal with it alone. You could sit in London, Vienna or Paris and lecture Greece all day, but in the end if your own country was somehow beamed to the South and received a huge number of illegal immigrants, you'd understand that there are no magic solutions. Especially when fiscal discipline is in order.

The logic of the opposition and these new media (the author just reproduces Unfollow's story) is this: if there is a problem the government is to blame, because we do not govern. Their platform is based on blatant lies. For example, they managed to convince some desperate poor people that the day following the elections things will instantly become better, other countries will somehow have to forgive over half of Greece's debt etc. It's ironic how dozens of opposition MPs declared deposits of hundreds of thousands of Euros and speak of socialism.

The whole article is filled with half-truths. For example, the current Health Minister studied History and Archaeology. His father died prematurely and from a young age he had to work and save the family publishing house, which was frequently burnt to the ground by pseudo-anarchists friendly to people related to the opposition. He later became famous for selling his books on TV. As for the ""cancers are not urgent"" statement, it is taken out of context. He meant that if you are uninsured and hit by a car, the hospital will treat you in any case. If you are uninsured and have cancer that is not terminal, you'll have to fill some paperwork and go through a procedure. Speaking of this, it is surprising how many people don't know that they are eligible to request an ""uninsured's booklet"" from the local authorities. It allows you to use all public hospitals and pharmacies for free. 100% free. If you are a Greek and know an unemployed person that is not covered by another scheme, please let him or her know about that.

Regarding the conditions in this prison hospital, yes, they are bad. But stating that somehow the government and the employees plot to kill people is idiotic. New hospitals do not appear out of thin air and it doesn't matter if you are a leftist or a conservative. There are procedures to follow and there are discussions to have, in the Parliament and elsewhere. It will seem bad to say that, but these people are still prisoners. They did something illegal. It's not easy to let them all go to a regular hospital at once.

As for Troika matters etc. Only an uninformed person would suggest that Greece is not a sovereign state any more, or that Greece is a hellhole from end to end. As a matter of fact, most places outside Athens haven't felt the effects of the crisis in the same way as Athens does. This again has to do with most illegal immigrants ending up in Athens, putting a strain on prisons and hospitals that are already filled up. I'm sorry but Greece wasn't founded to save every single person on the world, it has a duty to take care of Greeks first.

Finally, it is true that the Troika made many bad decisions and Germany's conservatives played a big role in that. But the taxpayers didn't paid a single Euro yet. They even made some cash on top and this was stated by other European officials. I remember the Austrian finance minister repeating that last year. The loan agreements don't work the way you think they are. Nobody takes out Euros from your country to ship them to Greece. States can collectively borrow from the markets at market rates. But they don't lose cash. ECB is balancing things out behind the scenes, providing their banks with liquidity. At the same time these banks received a lot of deposits from Greece and other crisis-hit countries because depositors were scared they'll lose all their savings.

That's about correct, yes.

&gt;Do you think that is is being used as a fig leaf in an attempt to disguise economic motives?

As military reponses are out of the question during the *current* crisis, I'd say no. The German government is speaking in terms of ""not alienating any party"" when they want to give euphemisms for putting our direct economic needs first.

I would agree with your assessment if we're talking about Germany's general attitude towards military spending, however. The current government is very slowly attempting to revert this, such that we are able to offer more support to our NATO allies when they actively seek to project hard power (in particular France).

&gt;Also, does Russia have you over their knee with the gas supply, and has this caused anyone to reconsider the total abandonment of nuke power?

I am unsure about how much we are dependent on Russia in the mid to long-term, but our economy would definitely take a turn for the worse if the Russians stopped to consider us as a valuable trading partner. 

Russia wasn't the reason to abandon nuclear energy. Germany has a long history of a very successful environmental movement. They have been represented in the higher echelons of power for almost 20 years now, and have wide grass-root support in Germany.

After Fukushima, Merkel simply did what was then most popular and decided to scrap nuclear power (even though she had it 'renewed' after it had already been nearly scrapped during the previous government. Her argument went something along the lines of having underestimated the dangers of nuclear power .. she has a PhD in physics). This occured just before some important elections. The only credit I can give to her is that the move was very wise politically, and she has stuck to her decision this time around.

In any case, I'd argue that it would be easier to reduce emissions and become energy independent if we put nuclear into our mix. Most energy experts would agree, I assume. Our current ""renewable minus nuclear only""-attitude is a definite result from the strong popular support this attitude has.

And 45 minutes travel time from Cologne to Hamburg compared to 4 hours in the train is just great. Take off in Cologne, loosen your seat belt, get tomato juice, fasten your seatbelt, be in Hamburg :D

Regarding fast trains: To save money, you can also check Last Minute Bahn Tickets from [LTUR](http://bahn.ltur.com/index/ConditionSpar), for example. But you have to be lucky to have your desired connection offered and you can only book a week before the trip at the earliest.

&gt; Short trips [...] You don't need to buy tickets in advance (it's always the same price, so you can be spontaneous).

This is indeed pretty nice, especially travelling to near bigger cities. Just keep in mind that you can't buy tickets inside the train, they removed the machines quite a while ago, but all the stations provide machines and if they are defective, Deutsche Bahn is insightful (that's my experience). 

In the countryside/smaller towns the connections are less frequent and a LOT slower.

You could argue they've been punished enough though. Their baby was killed at six days old. I don't see what locking them up would achieve in this case.

I'm entitled to this much and I can back it up if necessary. This also had been the opinion of pretty much every Russian in this thread.

I have answered each and every one of your questions. Can Chechens have their referendum? Sure, why not. Many Russians would be very happy if they left Russia and had their own country. Do they have the right to do so? Sure, if you say so. What's your objection? You say that there is some *them* in Chechnya that call for referendum and don't want it to be part of Russia. Much like the activist groups currently active in Crimea. So where are these people?

You repeatedly failed to describe who these people are. You just made up this conjuncture that there is some dissent present in Chechnya, that involves a group of people large enough to be taken seriously and calls for some measures, such as above-mentioned referendum. But you have no evidence of it, it's just some nonsense you made up to make your bullshit assertion. Boo-hoo, evil Russkies are being hypocrites again, oppressing the freedom-loving peoples of Chechnya. Oppressing whom? You really have no clue about the subject, about the players involved, and so far your only arguments were some child-like assumptions that have little to do with reality. What's your point?

Why not hold another referendum in Pakistan and Afghanistan, if these guys would like to have the Taliban take over. Might have another one in Iraq, a referendum where the public would take a pick between the sunni militants paid by Saudi and the shia militants paid by Iran. Then you could have a referendum in Syria, Nigeria, Mali and the rest, about their willingness to accept Al Quaeda as their legitimate leaders. Then you could hold a referendum in Lebanon, about having Hezbollah in charge. I mean shit, why stop there. Lets run a referendum in Mexico, asking if people would like to be governed by local drug barons. Then you could have one in Cambodia. They still have some khmer rouges running around, no?

The second

Outisde London and the Southeast of England, Scotland is the most prosperous area of the UK, we have a very diverse economy which is roughly equivalent to the UK average in terms of GDP per head and that's without including oil.

There's a widespread feeling in the UK though that Scotland doesn't contribute our share (we do) and that's not a nice position when those same people control your funding.

both are really annoying but If I HAD to choose one it'd the Anti-English one, it's worrying that so many English people are under the impression that we hate them and we can't even have the Independence referendum based around greater representation without people chalking it up as another expression of being Anti-English",0,1394486673,null,0,false,0,cfzabpx,t3_202d3j,t1_cfzabpx,t3_202d3j,null,1432742827,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

Also I have a serious doubts that Denmark/Switzerland/Netherlands style democracy can be implemented in Russia. Countries are sooo different, at different development stages.

If UK and USA promised to maintain Ukraine territorial integrity, they had to send troops to Eastern Ukraine now, Eastern Europe would stop to freak out, there will be no talk about Ukraine dissintegration etc. But nooo, there are expenses involved (or may be behind the public discourse, UK/USA are satisfied with such a development? ... like Russia will bite more, than it can chew... so eventually it will choke... cardiac arrest ... and Russia will disintegrate, who knows???)

true,MartelFirst,IDF,Ile-de-France,"Yeah, all you need is money for transportation, and occasional money to buy packs of beers or something. I liken volunteer archaeological digs to summer camps for adults. I'd personally do it every summer if I had a month-long holiday every summer. You have a good time with other young people spending the summer, out in the sun, usually in French countryside far from civilization, digging interesting stuff. Some of the best times in my life were at digs. It might be sometimes hard physically, and maybe intimidating at first (most volunteers are university students in archeology, and they'll know their shit), but ultimately, at the end of the day, dirty, and tired, it's just so awesome to lay down in the sun, with the other volunteers, sipping a fresh beer and joking around.

Usually, the archaeologists supervising the digs are fun too. There's nothing formal. Many use crude language, buy beers as well, because they're living the life, and understand it's physically demanding and that thus the volunteers need to have fun. 

Don't hesitate to ask more about it. I'll gladly help out.

I'd just like to add that some dig sites ask for a minimum length of stay. Usually, the minimum is 3 weeks. I think 3 weeks away from home, in a remote area, is a good time. Not too short or too long. And anyway, once you're there, you could ask the archaeologist in charge if you can extend your stay, if there's room available. So my advice is that you go for 3 or 4 weeks, and if you're having a good time, chances are you can extend your stay by simply asking. Also, dig sites have different numbers of volunteers. It can go from 6 volunteers, to 40. A good number, which usually guarantees a good time, is a site that houses some 20 volunteers. It's not too big a number for it to be impersonal, and not too small so you're sure there will at least be a few other fun people. So if you can, try to get some info on how many volunteers a specific site houses.

I wonder though. What would the world have looked like had the central powers won in the war before that or it never happened at all. I mean it's much more difficult to establish lines between good and evil in that war if we'd compare it to WW2. It all escalated so fast in the July crisis and all after some stupid royal got shot.

I mean the nazis would have probably never taken the lead later on.

And what would have happened to all the colonies? Would they gain their independence much later, around the same time or not at all? Would they continue to be often treated as second grade or exploited or would modernist ideas take over bit by bit (See Leopold loosing Congo under international pressure) and changes make it so that relations are more similar to the comparable modern tiny colonies that are still left. Would Europe be economically stronger or worse? Would certain parts of the world like Africa still have problems with genocides, rebels and religious war or not?

On the colonies part I suppose history tells us it would not be beneficial for some/most whilst a few others may have been better of without the power-grabbings and wars that followed.

In Italia, il Presidente del Consiglio [PdC] (cioè il capo del Governo, mr. Renzi da qualche giorno) è nominato esclusivamente dal Presidente della Repubblica [PdR] (mr. Napolitano, soprannominato ""King Giorgio"").

&gt; art. 92 della Costituzione: ""*Il Presidente della Repubblica nomina il Presidente del Consiglio dei ministri e, su proposta di questo, i ministri.*"" 

Ad elezioni avvenute, le ""delegazioni"" di tutti i partiti prendono parte alle ""consultazioni"", cioè colloqui separati con il PdR, durante il quale il partito che ha vinto gli indica il suo candidato preferito alla Presidenza del Consiglio. Il PdR nomina così il PdC ""incaricato"", che si presenta davanti alle Camere (prima Senato, poi Camera dei Deputati) a chiedere la ""fiducia"" (confidence vote). Una volta che avrà ricevuto la maggioranza dei voti in Parlamento, il suo Governo sarà pienamente legittimato. Questo succede perché siamo una repubblica parlamentare, e alle elezioni votiamo per il Parlamento (centro di tutto il nostro sistema istituzionale), che esprime poi il Governo. 
C'è da dire però che negli ultimi anni la competizione elettorale si è ""americanizzata"", e molti italiani credono comunque di votare direttamente per il Presidente del Consiglio (come succederebbe in una repubblica presidenziale). 

Se durante la ""legislatura"" (cioè la durata in carica del Parlamento, 5 anni da noi, ogni quanto si vota) il Governo non ha più la maggioranza dei voti delle Camere (oppure fatti esterni lo indeboliscono politicamente), il PdC si dimette e fa scegliere al PdR cosa fare, il quale può, dopo aver ascoltato le ""delegazioni"" di tutti i partiti: 1) scogliere le Camere anticipatamente, e noi italiani torniamo a votare 2) scegliere un'altra persona - o la stessa - per formare un nuovo Governo, che dovrà chiedere nuovamente la fiducia delle Camere. Quello che è successo in Italia qualche giorno fa è la seconda opzione: Letta (PdC) cade, Giorgio Napolitano (PdR) nomina Renzi, che riceve la fiducia del Parlamento e diventa il nuovo PdC. 

L'operazione fatta da Renzi e Giorgio Napolitano, ovviamente, è iscritta nel quadro della Costituzione, nessun problema. Molti però (non solo all'estero, anzi!) si pongono dei problemi politici a tutto questo. E per esempio ci chiediamo se forse non sarebbe meglio aggiornare la nostra bellissima Costituzione a questi tempi, votando direttamente per il Premier, e legandolo obbligatoriamente all'elezione delle Camere. 

Cosa vuoi sapere esattamente del sistema politico?

* Sono cristiano, quindi credo nel paradiso: non in un paradiso con gli angeli con la parrucca e l'arpa, sia chiaro, ma una enorme luce. La descrizione che provo a dare di paradiso è ""un posto dove è sempre maggio.""
Ma sono un cristiano abbastanza tormentato dai dubbi, per cui a volte viene meno la speranza e mi trovo a pensare che non ci sia nulla. L'idea di un aldilà è molto consolante, senza dubbio.

I think the stereotype should belong to the Dutch, they have a sense of humour but it's often really juvenile. Sorry my Dutch friends, you have many other redeeming qualities but... holy shit, I just googled to see if I had an consensus and :

&gt;[However, at the end of the 17th century the Dutch lost their sense of humor. The Dutch Republic was in decline, the Dutch Reformed Church denounced laughter and advocated sober lifestyles, and etiquette manuals appeared which considered it impolite to laugh out loud. This continued into the 1960s: during World War II, American soldiers were instructed not to tell jokes to the Dutch as ""they wouldn't appreciate it"".](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_customs_and_etiquette#Humor)

The world was focused around Europe.  
It was always a country from Europe that was the strongest in the world, first it was Greece, then Rome, then Germans, then Poles, then propably Germans again... Independent countries.  
Today Europe doesn't matter anymore. People think it does matter because it is in the center of the map. But it doesn't.  
Why? Pretty much because of the EU. Europe is drowning in immigrants, giving away money to lazy f_cks, Germany (oh, the almighty Germany!) has a growth rate of -2%. The EU signs IDIOTIC deals about fighting the global warming (which doesn't even exist) and slows down whole europe's growth even more. The EU started as a free-trade union, but today it is a Bureaucracy Union.  
China, a country 30 years ago 20 times poorer than Europe, introduced a free market, and today laughs at Europeans, how stupid they are. China became the world's second superpower, right behind the US. Within a few years, it will be the world's greatest superpower, with a 10% growth.  
THIS http://www.objectivesubject.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/229645279_fef2d36cac_b.jpg is how the world map really looks like today. Europe doesn't matter anymore.  
Fact: you remember when a few decades ago, when the Warsaw Pact still existed, some left wing, communist groups terrorized europe? the soviets were funding their weapons. They wanted socialism, and then communism.  
The European society pretty much hated them, and they got almost eradicated.  
But then, the ones left from these groups (Rudi Dutschke for example) thought ""why attack? why not just use democracy and become politicians, and gain power this way?""  
And they are the ones rulling in EU today. If you don't believe me, you can google it.

However I do not consider them the sole offenders for not doing something about it because lest you forget your very own country pushed trough a lucrative military aircraft deal with Greece in 2010. ""Nicolas Sarkozy, the French President told the Greek government that all existing arms contracts must be honoured."" I'm fine with the critique but I wouldn't focus it at a single scapegoat.

Countries would be just as eager to exploit Greek military spending but would have no real reason to keep it from crashing completely at their expense.

-you will be an illegal immigrant who speaks no italian in a country where speaking the language is essential. 
-ESL schools have plenty of labour supply courtesy of the UK, whose citizens can work here legally. I just spoke to a school the other day who is letting their star teacher, an american, go because they can't deal with the legal hassle.
-contracts are essentially a thing of the past. Not even Italians manage to get them anymore. Instead, your typical entry-level worker is an ""independent contractor"" and you need to have a work permit to do that.
-Many ESL schools pay late (months or years late) or do not pay at all. Not getting paid is extremely commonplace, and having to fight to get paid is routine. If a school knows you are working illegally and taht you don't know the system they are more likely to try not to pay you.

Despite all this many Americans work here illegally. I know one guy who managed to get his school to sponsor him. One guy. And he had to go back to the US for 6 months while the embassy processed his request. The rest do crap work (eg selling tours, nannying, etc) and hope they don't get caught. Getting caught can mean a deportation order. THey don't physically put you on the plane, but still, not a good thing to have happen. If you are staying for more than three months it means you can't really safely travel within Europe either because they are likely to ask where your residence permit is, either in transit or on return to Italy. I just got back to Italy today and he asked to see my residence permit (I'm American) THe laws are getting stricter too. Sorry if I sound dickish but I'd consider this 
carefully and have a plan B.

true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"Krass. Ich glaub hier haben viele gar nicht so richtig das Thema verstanden. Weder, was eigentlich im Artikel drinsteht, noch was der Sinn des GPG ist.


**Erstens**, der Inhalt der Studie ist im Prinzip nicht neu. Was da gesagt wird ist 1)selbstevident und 2)eigentlich altbekannt.

**Zweitens**, bevor jetzt die Meute losjohlt: ""Scheiß Feministen, hab ichs doch gewusst, Frauen werden DOCH gleichbezahlt!!!1"", sei gesagt:

Der GPG ist erst einmal **NICHT** dazu da, direkte Frauendiskrimierung zu belegen, sondern vor allem allgemein soziologische Ursachen für den un- und bereinigten GPG auszumachen, inklusive die Mutterschaft zb. Soll heißen: eine Art *indirekte* Diskriminierung in Form von bevor-/nachteilenden Strukturen.

Insofern kann wirklich absolut gar keine Rede favon sein, den GPG vom Kopf auf die Füße gestellt zu haben. Lächerlicher clickbait.

Zum Thema ""Direkte Diskriminierung aufgund des Geschlechts"":

Die wirklich interessante Frage ist nun ja, wie viel sich von den laut OECD übrig bleibenden 7-8% bereinigtem GPG wegen Mutterschaft abziehen lässt, und welcher Prozentsatz nun die tatsächliche Diskriminierung beziffert.


Rechnerisch ist das alles ja gar nicht mehr genau nachzuvollziehen. Deshalb; um das ganze runterzubrechen auf eine einfach Aussage:

&gt;Für Statistiker gibt es erklärbare Variablen: Die Diskriminierung ist zwar da, kann aber teilweise begründet werden.

*(Zitat: [ZEIT Artikel zum GPG](http://www.zeit.de/karriere/beruf/2013-03/lohnunterschied-geschlechter-statistik))*


&gt;In drei repräsentativen Bevölkerungsumfragen der Jahre 2008 und 2009 kamen Forscher der Universität Bielefeld, der Universität Konstanz und des DIW zu dem Ergebnis, dass eine unterschiedliche Entlohnung von Männern und Frauen in der Bevölkerung zwar grundsätzlich abgelehnt wird. Wenn jedoch nach den konkreten Vorstellungen gefragt wird, wie hoch ein gerechtes Arbeitseinkommen im konkreten Einzelfall sein sollte, so wird **einer Frau ein deutlich geringerer Lohn zugebilligt als einem gleich qualifizierten Mann.**

*(Zitat: [wikipedia ""Gender Pay Gap""](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Pay_Gap#Ursachen))*

Es bleibt also anzunehmen, dass **direkte Diskriminierung** faktisch vorhanden ist, auch wenn man den konkreten Betrag doch schlecht ausrechnen kann (-&gt;ZEIT).


Insofern ist die Artikelüberschrift von Heise nochmal eindeutig als massiv irreführend und unfassbar oberflächlich überführt.

Wie bereits gesagt:

Der Sinn beim Gender Pay Gap ist doch eigntlich die Hervorhebung von Fehlkonstruktionen im System, die zum Beispiel die wirtschaftliche Segregation, Bildung und Berufswahl und Vereinbarung von Arbeit und Privatleben der Frau bestimmen und sie unterm Strich nunmal benachteiligen. Das bedeutet natürlich indirekt eine Privilegierung der Männer und Diskrimierung von Frauen.

Es ist leider immer noch so, dass unser System Frauen freie Berufswahl/Jobwahl usw zwar nicht verwehrt, so aber auf jeden Fall **erschwert**.

Und genau dieser Umstand wird durch den bereinigten GPG ausgedrückt, der laut OECD immer noch bei 22% in Deutschland liegt. 

Das sind keine 22% nur wegen Mutterschaft.

Das sind 22%, weil unser System Männer indirekt bevorteilt, indem es Frauen benachteilt (zb Jobaufgabe der Frau bei Mutterschaft durch strukturellem KITA Mangel; soziologische Stereotype die Berufswahl betreffend-&gt;berufliche Segregation).

Daraus folgt, dass man den Artikel gleichzeitig bejahen und verneinen muss:

Ja, Mutterschaft macht einen großen Teil der Differenz aus &amp; Nein, direkte Diskriminierung von Frauen spielt trotzdem eine unbestimmte (kleinere) Rolle.


[Als kleines Schlusswort wünschte Ich mir, r/de wäre immer so eloquent und ausfürhlich-differnziert wie es bei wirklich jedem noch so kleinsten Randthema sein möchte.

So, they do define the meaning of a word for you.

&gt;Because you seem to hold a de facto approach to linguistic syntax I thought you would appreciate this concept.

Sorry for the technicality, but: we're not debating syntax (sentence structure), but semantics (meaning of words) and orthography (proper spelling), the second being a slight deviation from the original topic into the the area of spelling competitions.

It can.

So, you are blaming the E.U. for higher taxes when the E.U. has no powers over taxes?

&gt;did you see europe's debt?

You wrote that Germany's 'growth' is -2%. You moved the goalpost.

&gt;umm... on what i wrote above?

So, your personal opinion?

&gt;hey, scientist! are you poor because of extremely high taxes? do you want to get rich?

What an intelligent retort to the years scientists put in their work, and, you just dismiss all of their findings with just *one* sentence. I mean, how much more arrogant can you get?

&gt;just say that global warming is caused by humans, and then we will steal funds for fighting it

Nobody is saying that we should fight to stop it. You can acknowledge that its happening without supporting fighting the climate change. 

I noticed there is a huge denial amongst Conservatives on the basis that if they accept there is global warming (even though they can't deny all of the evidence in favour of it), then they will have to support policies which fight it.

&gt;it is. for example the minimum VAT eu members can set is 15%.

Again, you changed the subject from ""Try selling X on the streets"" to VAT, which is a competence of the Union. You can't keep up with the claims you make?

&gt;we would be represented by a weak, dying shadow of a once dominant civilization.

Really? And how did you decide that?

&gt;pro-european politics.

Provide evidence.

&gt;i just wrote a list of parties that rule in the europarlament, almost all of them clearly say that they are ""socialist"". 

Yes, you wrote political parties. I asked you how did you make the connection between Rudi Dutschke and those parties?

&gt;have you got trouble reading? 

No, I have trouble following people who don't make logical sense.

&gt;there was peace in ukraine, ukraine was neither pro-russian nor pro-eu. it was normal.

#

&gt;then the eu started sticking it's nose into it, and boom- euromaidan, invasion of crimea.

So, you admit you know nothing about the situation? 

Here is how it went:

Ukraine itself wanted to sign FTA with the E.U. 

Yanukovych changed his mind, and went with Russia's proposal. 

People rebelled, he passed totalitarian anti-protest law 

Protests got violent.

Parliament ousted Yanukovych

Crimea got invaded.

Many of those who lended to Greece did so at a much lower rate and as Trucidator explained could have done some much better investments with it. Why did Merkel boast about it?

Even though Germany is among the more pro EU minded countries sending millions of tax payer € to stem the Greek wound is not something you justify easily without pointing at the economic advantages and the consequences if southern Europe became a row of dominoes.

Do we blame the countries and their governments who still chucked military deals and loans at Greece? greek politicians for rolling with the corruption? The EC for actively following and even pushing bad advice in some areas? etc. What are you gonna do start some new semi anarchistic project?

In my opinion (but that's just me) The best way to halt all of this is by an actual proper  semi-federal system. One in which other countries only shoot themselves in the foot if they keep Greece on the payroll, military deals are not a lucrative intereuropean trade with a single coordinated military and preferably a number of other tweaks to the capabilities of the EP and EC.

Yes there's still going to be situations like this but in the end we all take a slice of the shit we may get us in.

There's also the ""Wochenendticket"" (for weekends) and the ""Quer-durchs-Land-Ticket"" (for weekdays).

Most Germans don't know this, but the cheapest way to travel within Germany are buses. For decades, there was a law that prevented long-distance bus connections and it was lifted just a bit more than a year ago. The whole business is still very young and not every city has a connection, but at the moment you can travel for insanely low (promotional) prices.

Nato is to bomb Russian allies in Syria like it bombed Serbia in order to split the country. Kosovo is to serve as precedent for splitting Syria, while it may not serve as precedent for the Crimea. 

That is easy to understand because the Americans are good and the Russians are evil. That is why we must ""escalate military pressure.""
