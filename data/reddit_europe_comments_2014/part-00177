true,JonasY,null,null,"&gt; You do know ukrainian officials tried to repair water supply multiple times and workers were shot at and driven away by terrorists?

And that is according to some other Ukrainian officials? You know what they said when the admin building in Lugansk got hit by an air strike?

&gt; The authorities in Kiev denied its planes had been involved. Initially, the anti-terrorist operation said the explosion originated from inside the building, then that an anti-aircraft missile operated by the separatists had misfired, reacting to heat from an air-conditioning system on the outside of the building.

...

&gt; But a CNN investigation in Luhansk has found clear evidence that whatever detonations hit the building and the adjoining park came from the air. The tops of trees were splintered, and a series of small craters -- about a dozen -- had been blasted in a straight line, starting in the park and reaching the walls of the building, blowing out many of its windows and spraying the area with jagged shrapnel. That's what appears to have killed most of the victims and injured 20 more.

You have given your opinion but could you give us your reasoning and perhaps define ""civil war"" in your understanding of the term.



The keys elements in the opposition are Russian citizens and majority of organisations and tactics support is also Russian. Those key elements pray on desperate elements of East Ukrainian population and manipulate them in to executing Russian geopolitics in the Ukraine. This is the safest way for Russia to be involved. They are minimising their losses and amplifying resonance of the effects of the war by using propaganda and lies and painting legitimate government as war mongers whos aim is to eradicate Russian ethnics, which anyone who is willing to put some time in to researching this conflict will see past Russian spawn lies and misinformation.

true,i_drah_zua,native-bavarian,native (Österreichisch),"I'll copy and paste together some parts of older comments of mine, so please excuse any errors and irrelevancies.  
Maybe you'll find something that helps you understand, or just accept, articles.  


[From this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1v39o6/eli5_why_dont_we_develop_a_new_international/ceok95r):  

&gt;Inanimate objects (and *all* other nouns) also have genders, but they are not biological ones, it's strictly grammatical.  
Example: der Tisch (the table) is grammatically masculine. I don't see it as male, even though I say (literally translated) ""He is expensive"".  

&gt;Often the genders of nouns help to see what is being referenced on later in the sentence, clauses or in later sentences.  
""The vase(f) fell right onto the table(m). But *he* didn't break.""  

&gt;The second sentence is clear what broke and what didn't. I could also say ""But she didn't break."", and it would again be clear what is meant.  
In English it would be ""The vase fell onto the table. But it didn't break."" It's always ambiguous, and you have to specify.  

[German version from here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LANL_German/comments/1vnd0e/need_some_help_regarding_word_order/ceudyrn):  
&gt;Compare  
""Die Vase ist auf den Glastisch gefallen, aber er ist nicht zerbrochen.""  
with  
""Die Vase ist auf den Glastisch gefallen, aber sie ist nicht zerbrochen.""  

[Also from the first comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1v39o6/eli5_why_dont_we_develop_a_new_international/ceok95r):  

&gt;But what I do notice is that often [in English] you read three sentences without knowing what gender a person is, and that is a bit weird and annoying to me.  
&gt;Genders of people are always the same grammatically wise.  

&gt;There are few exceptions, i.e. diminuatives which are always neuter, like the often as illogically quoted ""das Mädchen"", or nouns that can apply to both genders, like ""das Kind"" (the child), even though you know what gender it has, but I cannot think of anything more, really.  
But that's a small part of all nouns.  

[The previous paragraph is explained with examples here:](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1v39o6/eli5_why_dont_we_develop_a_new_international/ceohq36):  
&gt;It works with any word that describes a person:  
&gt;der Lehrer (teacher, m), die Schülerin (student, f), der Bekannte (aquaintance, m), die Bekannte (aquaintance, f), die Beamtin (civil servant, f), der Soldat (soldier, m), ...  

&gt; Example of ambiguity:
&gt;In English you say ""I'm bringing a friend"", which leaves the gender undefined.  
&gt;In German you'd say ""Ich bringe eine Freundin mit."" (f) or ""Ich bringe einen Freund mit."" (m).  

&gt; Of course, if you didn't want to disclose the gender (to not spoil a punchline, or to be secretive, ...) you could also say: ""Ich bringe jemanden mit."" (someone).  

&amp;nbsp;  

So, I don't know if it helps you, but it's an attempt to rationalise articles and genders, and shows that they aren't completely useless.  

Also, quite some imported words in the German language do have more than one article, and it often varies with location and dialect (partially copied from the internet):  
Das/die Cola, das/der Joghurt, der/das Radio, der/das Teller, die/das E-Mail, der/das Keks, die/das Aspirin, der/das Filter, der/das Gummi, der/die Paprika, der/die Sellerie, the list is almost endless.  

[Look here](http://www.deutschegrammatik20.de/das-substantiv-nomen/numerus-singular-plural/nomen-mit-zwei-artikeln-schwankender-artikelgebrauch/)

For those words there is not ""one true article"", it really depends on where you live and what dialect you speak. For example, most Germans say ""die Nutella"" while most Austrians say ""das Nutella"".  

If you are interested and able to read it, you can read the [Zwiebelfisch article in that](http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/zwiebelfisch/zwiebelfisch-der-butter-die-huhn-das-teller-a-432890.html), and there's a long list of nouns with multiple articles at the bottom.  

&amp;nbsp;  

And then there are words with different meanings, that only distinguish by their article:  
e.g.: die See - the sea / der See - the lake  

[Look here](http://www.deutschegrammatik20.de/das-substantiv-nomen/numerus-singular-plural/nomen-mit-zwei-bedeutungen-polysemie-und-homonymie/), but don't let this confuse you if it's too much, this is just an interesting list, and not meant as a learning aid.  

Just learn the nouns together with the article, and everything in there is no problem for you.

D'abord, non, on ne peut pas tout automatiser. Faire une coupe de cheveux ou repeindre une cage d'escaliers, on ne peut pas automatiser. Ensuite, il est faux de dire qu'on a besoin de moins de travailleurs. Il n'y a pas une quantité finie de produits a produire ou de services a rendre, qui serait en France plus basse que chez les autres et expliquerait le fort taux de chômage.

Le problème des inactifs est lié au fort cout du travail, que beaucoup de gens associent a tort aux salaires. En France, étant donné le niveau des charges sociales, et les couts annexes, il est parfaitement possible d'augmenter les salaires et de baisser le cout du travail (raison qui explique pourquoi le travail est moins cher en Suisse, avec des salaires plus élevés par ailleurs). C'est une bête question d'offre et de demande.

Donc soit on baisse le cout du travail pour les moins qualifiés (c'est un peu le principe qui sous-tend le statut d'auto-entrepreneur), soit on fait en sorte que les moins qualifiés deviennent plus qualifiés (formation professionnelle, formation initiale, etc.)

Mais l'idée qui consiste a ce que quelques-un travaillent pour financer les loisirs de tous les autres ne fonctionne pas sur le long terme. Même dans un pays comme la France ou c'est un peu le cas, on continue de taper sur les riches. Il y a un moment ou plus personne ne bosse...

true,ruincreep,null,null,"I'll summarize what I think is the gist of the podcast (regarding imported words from English only, as that's the only language that doesn't have genders - for other languages like Latin it's another story):

* first of all, there's no ""right"" gender for words imported from English, because they don't have a gender (the assumption that ""it = es = neuter"" is false, because there are no genders in English and therefore ""it"" has no meaning regarding the gender). So it's anyone's choice use any gender for new words, even if it sometimes sounds weird. After a while, when the word becomes more widespread, the gender the majority of the word's users use becomes ""more right"", just because you hear it more often. In his example, in the beginning of blogging, the first adopters said ""das Blog"" and were very serious about it. When blogging became a more widespread phenomenon, the majority of people in the ""scene"" used ""der Blog"". That doesn't mean ""das Blog"" is wrong all of a sudden though. Therefore the following points are not rules that say how it HAS to be done, but more observations on how it IS done, and of course there are exceptions. 

* for English nouns derived from verbs in present progressive form with the ending *ing is treated like the german infinitive (*en) and therefore become neuter: the feeling - das Fühlen - das Feeling. Maybe not the best example, but you get the point

* the word ending *ty (integrity, identity) is translated to *tät (Integrität, Identität) and imported words become feminine like most/all existing *tät words in german

* if a word is a synonym for an existing german word, the gender of that word is used, like in your example computer/Rechner. His example was: Christopher Street Day - der Tag - der CSD

* if none of those rules that make a word neuter or feminine apply, masculine is used as default

I don't see how ""die E-Mail"" fits in there and he doesn't mention this specific case, but he mentioned there are more rules he doesn't cover in the podcast that may apply before the masculine fallback. Or maybe the synonym-rule applies (die Post - die E-Mail)?

If you &gt;honestly believe that a pro Ukrainian coup is not going to produce a &gt;heavy reaction in the East then you are taking fantasy for fact.



I would not go as far as saying a ""heavy"" reaction. We are past the ""coup"" now and it is arguably a strong word to use here. The issue is that it is very difficult to see what the East have a problem with as no one from the East can clearly explain. The language issue is blown out of proportion and amplified by Russian lies and propaganda. What else? The East is all for corruption, because that is what Maidan was standing against and Maidan demands were to create more transparency, bring order and personal responsibility to governing elite and stop with this Russian integration as it has not brought any good to any ex Soviet state. So what is East standing for? Nothing that isn't what Maidan demanded but it was skewed by local criminals seeking to get to the helm of the region. Look what is happening there now, how businesses are being taken away, peoples possessions being taken away etc.

true,MAH_NIGGARD,native,native,"&gt; Generally there are two schools of thought for new words:
The first says foreign-imported words take the neuter. This is true for a lot of words imported from Latin.

I don't think that theory has any basis in reality. 

&gt; The second says it takes the form of a similar word that already exists in German. So Computer might be masculine (I don't know for certain so don't want to make any declarations, just an example that came to mind), because the German word that already existed for this was ""der Rechner"".

There are more mechanisms though.  
 Many endings are exclusively for one gender. -ität always is female (Universität, Rarität, Qualität etc.), -tion is also always female (Konstruktion, Abstraktion etc.) and there are many other endings like these.  
Often words that belong to the same ""group"" get the same gender. Marihuana obviously is female in Spanish. So is it female in German? No, because drugs usually are neuter, so it is das Marihuana.

 There are more rules like that and Germans nearly always instinctively know the gender of a new word.  

Laptop for example has 2 genders though. Der Laptop or more rarely Das Laptop. Both are correct. The piece of clothing called ""Top"" is definitely neuter though.

&gt; I've always been confused about email. I'd have thought it'd be masculine like der Brief, but maybe the first form was interpretted like die E-Mail-[Addresse].

Die Post (Sie haben Post!). Post is from Italian and female because it is female in their language.

To fix this, the European political class needs to engage the people directly, instead of leaving it to national parties who, surprise surprise, campaign on national (and sometimes even local or single-issue) platforms. *Then* we can talk about the Spitzencandidate as having a mandate, but not before. 

The antidemocratic part is carrying on regardless, as if it's votes and technicalities that matter, rather than engageing the people and taking them with you. The EU has a reputation, deserved or not, for being distant from the people it purports to represent. It might be the right idea, therefore, to have a candidate chosen by (rather than simply approved by) the parliament, but it's the wrong way to go about it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The East is all for corruption, because that is what Maidan was standing against and Maidan demands were to create more transparency, bring order and personal responsibility to governing elite and stop with this Russian integration as it has not brought any good to any ex Soviet state. 

You have no idea. Politics in Ukraine can't be understood like that, it will never make sense from a Western perspective. Unless it is put under a shroud of lies which reduce the phenomenon to a good guys versus bad guys situation. And the good guys are for transparency, political responsibility, proactiveness and other fancy buzzwords.

Russia is more easy to understand. There's the untouchable party of Putin with its faux-imperial center and its restoration of Soviet and Tsarist traditions. It's creative approach to democracy and freedom of speech. Then at the fringe there is a large collection of nutjobs among which the mystical conservatists, the naieve liberals and of course the communists. Not at all an ideal situation, but it is predictable and workable.

In Ukraine these fringe nutjobs aren't there for entertainment, they are Ukrainian politics. What the people on the street protested about in Maidan, it has already been butchered, ignored and rendered irrelevant by the polticians and elites these people put there trust in. Not that the people were just protesting for these Western values, no, they were heavily invested in Ukrainian nationalism and conservatism as well. 

But in any case, the part of Maidan that the West supported and at its turn supported positive Western values has largely been murdered by the ruthless Ukrainian political reality. It was a good try though, but alas. They'll try again in 4 years, it's what they usually do.

Maidan is over. The time of hopeful peaceful protests on liberty square is over. The conservative nutjobs won, the shitty carrousel of Ukrainian politics kept turning. And now it's about civil war. 

And that's what the East fears and is willing to fight. They aren't opposed to an honest attempt to fight corruption and the interests of elites influencing politicians. All sides of the political spectrum are almost equally guilty of that. The East fights the people who have taken power who do not represent the interests of Eastern Ukrainian and do not have the slightest legitimacy over Eastern Ukraine. They're not risking their lives to fight transparancy, that's fucking absurd.

&gt;Lets see now: Chechnya, two wars, thousands dead. How about Georgia? What about Ukraine now? Transnistria? What about law and order within Russia itself? How about death of journalists who oppose government? Am I still being ridiculous?

I can't speak for Transnistria since I don't know anything about that situation but yes, you are being ridiculous.

true,NieustannyPodziw,POLA,Poland,"&gt; The solstices and equinoxes should be our four major  holidays for sure.

In Poland they actually are:

1. Winter solstice of course become Christmas, many pagan customs are now Christmas traditions, for example [Christmas tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree#Poland), kolędowanie or [koledari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koledari) (totally assimilated by Christianity: pretend that the Sun is the Star of Bethlehem, horned prankster-spirit Turoń is the Devil, add Three Wise Men and some angels and suddenly it's oh-not-pagan-at-all ;)), empty seat for ghosts/unsuspected ~~ghosts~~ guest, etc.
2. Spring equinox is still somewhat alive. On the first day of spring young kids build an effigy of [Marzanna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marzanna), the goddes of winter and death, and drown it or burn it (or both) in order to make the winter go away. For older kids it's Traunt Day, when they skip school classes (some schools actually legalize this custom, and organize trips or other activities instead of classes), however it's probably not linked to equinox traditions (not directly at least). Some other customs become Easter traditions, for example [Śmigus-Dyngus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Śmigus-Dyngus), Polish-style easter eggs, some traditional food (kołacz, [mazurek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazurek_(cake)#Mazurek_tradition), [Easter Baskets](http://easteuropeanfood.about.com/od/polisheaster/a/blessing-baskets-swieconka.htm), etc.
3. Summer solstice we already explained in this thread.
4. Autumn equinox is known as Dożynki or [Dozhinki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dozhinki), the harvest festival, probably the biggest festival in rural areas. Completely assimilated by Christianity, usually local priest is the host of the festival.

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"No, I don't think they wanted peace even in the end. The Nazi's ideology was very clearly based on social darwinism of the worst kind, and this requires eternal struggle. I doubt their perfect Empire would have been too peaceful, even if they had crushed all external opposition. Infighting was crucial to their own ideology, as can be seen by all the events that lead up to WWII (Night of long knives). And there would always be an internal enemy as long as more than two people were alive.

Edit: More generally, I believe any political system which ultimately bases its power on the oppression of its citizenry will never have peace. The reason is that even in the absence of external enemies, you will have to worry about internal ones (organised or not), and as long as human beings aren't immortal, transition periods will occur. Examples would be the Communist regimes. If, for example, a liberal leader dies and a more Stalinesque one appears, you can kiss ""internal"" peace goodbye. 

At least if you define peace from the perspective of how free from violation (physical and psychological) the life of the average citizen is, you will find that many regimes have their internal clocks set to war.",0,1403432575,null,0,1403432947,0,cidyeko,t3_28s46d,t1_cidyeko,t1_cidybe3,null,1434349651,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

They're either for or against it. I don't know about you guys, but I haven't seen a single thing to suggest that Obama is even upset or concerned in any way. 

This is how anyone who even pretends to be anti-Russian would've handled Crimea's annexation if they were the president of the United States:

* Send entire fleet to the Black Sea, park it in Romanian ports.

* Force Turkey to close the Bosporus.

* Close the straits between Denmark and Sweden to cut the Baltic Sea off from the Atlantic. 

* Make Finland join NATO.

* Close the Gulf of Finland to cut off mainland Russia from the Baltic Sea completely.

* Aim his guns at Kaliningrad, Russia cannot physically reach it without stepping on NATO territory thanks to the previous measures, use it as a means to apply pressure on Russia.

* Make Moldova join NATO, oust any pro-Russian governmental elements with Romanian aid.  

* Declare Russian minorities in eastern bloc countries a national security issue, implement martial law in the areas they reside in. 

* Cut off that southern Ukrainian bit between Moldova and Romania to negate any Russian incursions, keep going north and gradually arm the Nistru's entire western bank, all the way into Ukraine.

* Start deporting or imprisoning Russian minorities in eastern bloc countries due to the very real risk they represent to those countries' security. 

* Start pounding Kaliningrad with total impunity, pass the ball to Putin.

That would be the bare minimum that Obama would've had to do to even pretend his stance on the whole thing is anything but pro-Russian. Instead we got ""sanctions"", ""slamming"" and ""blasting"". 

NATO doesn't exist without the US. Since Obama is pro-Russian until proven otherwise, that makes your plight and mine even drearier than before.

I do agree with some of what you're saying. But a big part of the trouble is much of what the EU parliament does **is** distant from the people. It is mostly very boring. That's not to say it's not important but you're not going to get voters excited by it. 

""Check out this report on 'Promoting free movement by simplifying the acceptance of certain public documents' we've been looking through!"" doesn't make for very exciting election literature.

That's not to say I disagree that they need to engage more, they should also be running more under their european grouping not their national party and that should be fairly fixed what grouping they're in before the election not after.

&gt;but it's the wrong way to go about it.

I think they didn't have a choice. The national governments didn't confirm or reject their idea and as you pointed out the national parties control the election campaigns. There is a problem there **but** pushing ahead with their plan is the best course of action. 

Yes this time their candidate does not have the full democratic legitimacy but he has more democratic legitimacy than the last president of the Commission and if they stick with this method the next PotC will have even more legitimacy because the spitzen candidates will get more attention.

Nationalistic ideology, on the other hand, is on the rise: there are lots of writers, philosophers, historians (including immigrants to Europe) discussing and supporting it. Their points are: Russia is a European country, which belongs to European culture; soviets are bad, soviet borders are artificial and to be reconsidered, most of Ukrainian and Belarusian ARE Russians.

One thing for sure: soviet borders, which were made to fight with local nationalism, are falling: Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan and now Ukraine already had civil wars and more to come. There are dozens of Kosovo-like cases all around former USSR.

People perception is more of a generation thing: elderly remember that Ukrainian are ""brothers"" and can't understand how their ""brothers"" could go against Russia - their only answer is that evil Americans or fascists from the Moon have come to power by lying to nice Ukrainians.

It appears as snippets of text taken out of context and filled with nothing less but ""fancy buzzwords"". Let me explain, who was to rely on a shroud of lies is Kremlin in order to maintain its grip on inert population, fortunately for us Europeans dirty Kremlin lies don't work and we see Russian government for what it really is. This is where Kremlin fails to understand how civilised world works. Nice attempt to project Russian system on Ukraine with regards to fringe groups, but no, you are wrong. Those fringe groups are essential in Russia, they feed Kremlin its power and strength and are used as an instrument to execute Kremlin very controversial and unwritten policies (control of foreigners for example, hence large number of neo nazi and pure orthodox christian groups). They rely on it to brainwash its unsuspecting proportion of populous with its garbage propaganda and used actively to divert attention from criminal activities that take place in the government.



I can assure you that what happens in Russian is no where near as much as in the Ukraine. I can also assure you that Ukrainian population is politically mature much more than Russian and activities in Kiev and the whole Ukraine is a very good example to it. After the recent events and European integration will force Ukrainian government to adopt and restructure itself for more transparency and responsibility. If you don't see this or don't understand you should turn of RT. It is astonishing how you are able to claim that people who have taken power are a) do not represent changes and more civilised perhaps more westernised system of more transparency and personal responsibility; b) they have no legitimacy of the Eastern part of the Ukraine; are you saying that referendum in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine was legitimate? You should be ashamed of yourself if you honestly believe this unless you are doing this for money. 



Finally, the way you conduct your discussion is based on straw man argument, which is very typical of those in support for Russian actions and it stems from lack of understanding and lack of apprehension. Russia has no business getting involved in to other countries business. Chechnya, Georgia and Ukraine can chose their own path and if it is outside of what Russia wants, tough luck. What Russia does then is put on a show and fires up propaganda machine on how Russian population being discriminated against in said territory.

Das Buch selbs hat absolut nichts mit der AfD zu tun. Nur weil diese den Euro kritisieren macht sie das nicht gleich zu Libertären und nur weil sie dadurch vielleicht unter den populäreren Parteien am wenigsten weit vom Standpunkt dieses Buches entfernt sind macht es dieses Buch auf keinen Fall zu einer ""AfD-Bibel"". Vor allem weil es bei der typischen Eurokritik darum geht den Mangel an Kontrolle der jeweiligen Staaten über ihr Geld als das Übel darzustellen, was dem Grundgedanken dieses Buches völlig zuwiderläuft. Schlechte Vergleiche ""mit einem AfD-Anhänger"" helfen da auch nicht weiter.

Zum Text:

&gt;Der „Unwissende“ wird an die Hand genommen und in Geheimnisse der Wirtschaftswahrheit eingeführt. Ein Buch über Volkswirtschaft, das völlig ohne Statistiken, Tabellen und Mathematik auskommt, sieht man nicht alle Tage. Das ist ja zunächst einmal etwas Positives. **Etwas Verführerisches.** In einen Kommentar las ich, das Buch sei eine Einstiegsdroge – als ob Einstiegsdrogen jemals zu etwas Gutem führen würden.

Danach:

&gt;Das ist verführerisch simpel erklärt.

Die Grundkritik hier wäre also das Thema sei zu simpel erklärt um wahr sein. Auch wenn es nicht explizit erwähnt wird, scheine es mMn. doch gewaltig durch. Das die Autoren des Buches auf diese Kritik im Buch selbst eingehen bleibt unerwähnt. Weiter:

&gt;Wer keine Schulden macht, lebt freier. Wer sein Geld steuerfrei kassiert – mangels kaum vorhandener staatlicher Aufgaben, gibt es in dieser Ideal-Welt auch nur ganz geringe Steuern und praktisch keine Beamten –, der gibt es sinnvoll und immer irgendwie werterhaltend aus. Nun ja. Da kenne ich Menschen, bei denen das anders wäre, aber egal. **Die gingen dann eben vor die Hunde.**

und

&gt;Das Ganze klappt natürlich nur, wenn man auch noch auf ein umlagefinanziertes Rentensystem verzichtet. Das geht ja auch im Prinzip ganz einfach, weil die Eltern später von ihren Kindern versorgt werden. Kinder sind Altersvorsorge. Wenn sie keine haben, dann helfen die anderen Bürger schon aus Gründen der Menschlichkeit. **Okay, wenn nicht, dann eben nicht.**

Mal abgesehen, dass die von mir hervorgehoben Stellen von Schmitz stammen und nicht von den Autoren des Buches, was nicht unbedingt gleich ersichtlich ist, bleibt ein weiterer Punkt der Autoren unerwähnt: Nach ihnen kommt viel der von Vielen empfundenen sozialen Kälte dadurch erst zustande, dass es den Menschen möglich wird ihre Verantwortung abzugeben. Würden die Menschen selbst wieder die Verantwortung tragen, würde den Menschen besser geholfen werden können, und wenn dies nicht so wäre, warum sollte dann ein System das auf diesen Menschen beruht und Politiker an dessen Spitze stehen funktionieren?

&gt;Zum anderen gäbe es für die Bürger keine Mauer mehr. Dann könnten sie sehen, dass es anderen besser geht. Das hätten die DDR-Bürger noch mit dem Blick nach Westen gekonnt.

dazu:

&gt;Der aus dem Osten gesehene „goldene Westen“ war also gerade kein Beispiel für das Bürger-Paradies der Österreichischen Schule.

Das ist nun einfach schlecht geschrieben. Die Autoren des Buches sind der Meinung, dass eine Gesellschaft, basierend auf ihrem System, es besser hätte als der Westen es jetzt hat und dass wenn dieses System parallel zu unserem existieren würde wir den Vergleich hätten, den die DDR damals hatte. Schmitz schießt hier also völlig daneben. 

&gt;„Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland ist ein demokratischer und sozialer Bundesstaat“ steht in Art. 20 GG. Und ich bin froh, dass das da steht und diese staatliche Ordnung auch nicht beseitigt werden darf. **Mit der Wirtschaft der Autoren wäre der Sozialstaat vom Tisch und Schwache von der Gunst der Starken abhängig.**

Ein weiterer Punkt der Autoren der hier ignoriert wird, da sie eindeutig vertreten, das dies schon jetzt der Fall ist, nur dass im Moment diese Starken das Geldsystem unter ihrer Kontrolle haben.

Dem ""AfD-Anhänger"" blinden Glauben zu unterstellen und dann so etwas abzuliefern und zu erwarten, das es jemand blind glaubt grenzt schon an Beleidigung.

It might take a decade or more before the results of this shift will be felt, so after you step out of the EU all seems cosy and fine, but once the already running programmes are finished, new partially EU funded programmes will become more and more rare.

We joined the EEC and the EU. We were one of the first non founding members and that's what brought us prosperity. NI wasn't a part of that. The Celtic tiger proved we had more than enough money to go around and looking at how it was spent having NI might have actually been good for *us*. Our competitive corporation tax would have debatably rejuvenated NI's dying industry. Westminster absolutely was a distant government (and still is, look at how the treat Scotland with contempt, they straight up ignore NI until there's trouble over flags or something) that was completely out of touch with the problems of the country. Its lack of sovereignty prevented it from making decisions which would have benefited it (joining the EEC being the least of them).


&gt; the UK has been a much bigger, much stronger economy and has pumped copious amounts of money and political capital into NI the whole time.

NI is only a sinkhole because British politicians prefer to pump money into it rather than make policy changes that would make NI more economically competitive at the expense of mainland Britain.


&gt;It's pretty pointless to have a conversation about this because we'll just trade atrocities as if it was some sort of proof. Both sides have a lot to answer for but that doesn't change the fact that the government of another sovereign state (RoI), was funding and harbouring terrorism against civilians in British territory both in in NI (where more than half the population wanted to remain British) and on mainland UK.

Both sides were horrible, no one is going to argue that but Irish nationalism and resistance was entirely reactionary and much more discriminatory than British persecution.

&gt;Regardless of what you think of that, the real problem with it is that all along, the people in power in RoI never actually wanted to reunify with the North (and still don't for that matter), so in that light the lengths they went to to destabilise NI and encourage the conflict is pretty despicable imo.

That is a lot of hearsay and while I won't deny the Irish government was slow to investigate paramilitaries on our side of the border, to say that we outright supported it in an effort to destabilise NI is just speculation. It could be true but we'll never know and it spits in the face of the efforts made by the Irish government to bring the good Friday agreement to fruition.

As for the wished of the NI people. Today the majority want to stay but during the troubles there was never a referendum and no polls that weren't biased towards loyalists. There was an Irish catholic majority that was suffering real persecution at the hands of British rule and to brush over their plight is just revisionism. ""Its ok now, it was always ok. Not as bad as people say, just a few bad eggs."" A sentiment shared by the British ruling class towards a lot of its former colonies.

What they don't realize though is that much of the rest of the world has caught up to and surpassed the UK, and that if the UK were to go at it alone that they would be little more than a second rate regional power. 

The UK has, IMO, three choices:

Manufacturing closer to the border and having tons of cheap labour would make us more competitive, so Catalonia and the Basque Country were given a higer priority for public grants and infraestructure development, while the more isolated regions were deliberately neglected so that they would provide a steady supply of migrant labourers.

In the intermediate years I think a lot of the harshest restrictions have been lifted a little bit, but dog owners are probable very aware that a new wave of incidents would bring even harder restrictions.

What you're doing here, in your desperation to place Romanians up there on the list of 21st century victims who we should all pity, is ignore the fact that Norwegians don't need to beg either. If you are here legally, you get help. If not legally admitted to the country then just like any other country you will be deported. It isn't a bad thing for Norwegian beggars either as contact with the police will lead to contact with social services which = getting help. The police here aren't going to 'abuse the law' because they aren't the police in the US or any other country where they get a bad rap for that kind of behaviour, even if errors do occur occasionally.  Don't believe all the anti-police hype you hear.

Let me ask you a question, where do Norway's homeless go for 2-3 months in winter when it's so cold that a human would die outside?  They go inside where help is at hand. Or they leave and go home. The beggars don't need to beg, help is there for everyone and that is what this law is partly about.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The truth of the matter is we have a decade or two left to get greenhouse gases under control before it becomes too late to stop catastrophic climate change and billions of humans along with most species of plant and animals die off. Greenhouse gases are the most important contributor. By switching to shale gas, the US has cut emissions back to the levels they were in the early 90's and the rate is going down faster. We've almost completely stopped using coal. Most renewable energy equipment comes from China. Chinese manufacturers build solar panels and other alternative power components using mainly coal fire power plants which negates the the savings on greenhouse gases Europe is getting by switching over. Just economically, the amount of manufacturing that is closing up shop in Europe and moving to the US where gas has lowered the price along with the emissions to a fraction of what it costs in Europe should be worrisome. 

Some benefits:

&gt; David Victor, an energy expert at UC-San Diego, estimates that the shift from coal to natural gas has reduced U.S. emissions by 400 to 500 megatons CO2 per year. To put that number in perspective, it is about twice the total effect of the Kyoto Protocol on carbon emissions in the rest of the world, including the European Union.

and

&gt; Indeed, U.S. carbon emissions have dropped about 20 percent per capita, and are now at their lowest level since Dwight D. Eisenhower left the White House in 1961.

Similarly, France and the German Empire negotiated their original armistice in WWI in a [dining wagon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compi%C3%A8gne_Wagon). When France surrendered to Germany in 1940, Hitler had the same wagon taken back to the same place and made the French sign the armistice there.

The harshness of the Versailles treaty is also partly a result of the French-German enmity, as is France's wish for similarly harsh conditions after WWII (although that was probably thought of as more of a safety measure).

Also the UK is in good need of increasing relations with their other close allies like Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, places that make more since to have an alliance than say... Croatia.

This is what I don't get. You make it sound like the decisions in Brussels are made in a vacuum and that the UK has no say in what happens. The fact of the matter is that the UK, as one of the biggest countries in Europe, could have a great deal of influence over what comes out of Brussels but would rather complain about everything instead. 

I hear these arguments and most of the time they are baseless. For example, what exactly is stopping the UK from increasing relations with Australia, Canada and New Zealand? You make it sound like some dictator in Brussels is forbidding the UK from doing anything.

Yeah but as they say:

&gt; The declining profitability and production primarily owed to lower oil prices and rising costs.


That's how the oil business works. That's why Russia is trying to prevent more supply from coming on the market. When oil goes down in price input prices rise and profitability falls. That's why Russia's economy is tied to oil prices. Bringing more supply online in Europe would lower the costs all around. Right now natural gas costs a third of Western Europe's price. Europe has plenty of room to open up production before the price of natural gas falls so dramatically. Oil isn't the shale booms major benefit, oil prices are tied to the global markets, where it counts is in natural gas which tend to be more local.

It does kind of. [Mobile missile shield aside](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/28s9dj/new_secret_recordings_of_polish_officials/cie0643), I've always believed that it was much more worth defending Eastern Europe with our soldiers than Western Europe, but now I'm not so sure. Why put our lives on the on the line in nuclear war over a continent that doesn't like us at all? If it wasn't for the helping Eastern Europe, I would think that NATO is a worthless institution and that it would be far better to work out a treaty between the US, Britain, Greece, Norway and France than to carry the rest of the dead weight.


Edit: Also Poland is badly misinterpreting the missile shield move in general. The US has to think globally about issues, which means if we want to prevent our ally Israel from bombing Iran's nuclear facilities we need cooperation on bringing Iran to the bargaining table, it means we need Russia to keep its airspace open as we withdraw from Afghanistan, it means we need to keep them neutral in disputes with China. Sometimes that means making token gestures like the missile shield. It doesn't mean you've been abandoned, it means that we currently don't believe a Russian invasion/nuclear strike on Poland in imminent. If the threat does become real you would see a lot of US soldiers and missile shields. Not for nothing, but we can't sacrifice our entire foreign policy to deploy a mobile system that can easily be assembled in times of crisis.",1,1403442923,null,0,1403443838,0,cie0a3z,t3_28s9dj,t1_cie0a3z,t1_cidygxe,null,1434350607,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

It was mindblowing to what degree they are pushing this absolutely idiotic narrative about Russia being threatened by Nazis and US.

My superficial diagnose of post-Soviet Russian mentality is that they actually fabricate this grand-narrative to substitute the emptiness left by collapse of the ""empire"". Average Russian politician needs this  story of ""nr.1 country in the world is their arch enemy"", same story they grew up with to feel relevant again. You can even notice how he  emphasizes the fact that Cold War is World War 3 and soon theres  World War 4(actually 2nd Cold War). This overwrite of definitions makes them even more relevant in retrospective, puts them on the world map fighting for nr.1 spot against US.
 
The biggest trigger of this late aggression was not Nato coming closer to Russias borders as many claim. It was the opposite, the fact that US was pulling out from Europe and focusing on Pacific, that was the real offense to post-Soviet mind. 

In short, my diagnose is that Russia is suffering classical case of self-aggrandizement that is pretty common for ex-empires. I just hope they are able to grow out of it without going too crazy(Germany is bad example of this). 

I'm actually very curious how will US react to the death of their empire(which is arguably happening right now, in slower pace). This is going to be real interesting. But its another story and still to be seen.

All of these required a degree of Russian cooperation which the move helped. Nobody thinks it is unthinkable for Russia to attack, but as you said not for like 20 years. Israeli hardliners won't give the US that long and if the US is to have a better force deployment to counter Russia it needs to move a lot of men and equipment out of Afghanistan. Most likely you will get some sort of US troop deployment to augment it, but like Churchill said ""All I need is one American solider, preferably dead, to guarantee the defense of Europe."" (paraphrased)

&gt; Also Poland is badly misinterpreting the missile shield move in general. The US has to think globally about issues, which means if we want to prevent our ally Israel from bombing Iran's nuclear facilities we need cooperation on bringing Iran to the bargaining table, it means we need Russia to keep its airspace open as we withdraw from Afghanistan, it means we need to keep them neutral in disputes with China. Sometimes that means making token gestures like the missile shield. It doesn't mean you've been abandoned, it means that we currently don't believe a Russian invasion/nuclear strike on Poland in imminent. If the threat does become real you would see a lot of US soldiers and missile shields. Not for nothing, but we can't sacrifice our entire foreign policy to deploy a mobile system that can easily be assembled in times of crisis.

The UK will need to understand that in the Eurozone, we need more Europe, not less. On the other hand, the other EU countries will have to accept that the UK will never participate in the euro, even if we may regret this. We have to accept that the UK will not become a member of the Schengen area.

The purpose of European Unity is simple; as the Cold War beckoned, the postwar aim of punishing and deindustrialising Germany now looked shortsighted. France needed German coal and iron, and we all needed Germans to buy our goods.

Europe needed the motor of the German economy to return to prosperity, and punishing Germany looked sure to push them into the arms of Moscow, or even a renewal of authoritarian dictatorship.

The question remained though, how to strengthen Germany without threatening the hard-won peace? The idea was that by binding Europe together economically, and then militarily, there would be less chance of war.

So yes, the European project is a direct descendent of WWII and the Cold War. Whether it is responsible for western Europe holding strong against the USSR, or for the absence of renewed war on the continent can never be 100% certain, but that was surely the aim.

The distinction is important because the only thing they have in common is that they live in the same country and that the name of their ethnic group is similar.

If they are illegally there then why haven't they been deported already? It's obvious who they are. If what you say is true then an anti-beggar law wouldn't be needed. Many people (now I am speaking about natives) who are homeless have already had contact with social services. These people are difficult to help because many of them have mental problems. In the new anti-beggar law how are offenders punished? Do they get a fine? Do they go to jail? How will fining a Norwegian homeless beggar improve their situation? Do they go to the social services, which they've probably have had previous contact with and failed, and then pay the fine? If the Norwegian beggar can't get helped how many times will the police fine him? It's really easy saying that help is there for everyone when you aren't the one in need. The reality is that one must put an effort in helping oneself for anyone else to help you and there are people who are unable to do that. Social services and government help only go so far.

Police brutality is obviously completely unthinkable. With authority there is absolutely no chance of corruption, misconduct or carelessness even in a country like Norway.

What do you mean I don't know the situation? The situation is very similar all across Europe. Romani people begging like it's their job organised in gangs and/or families.

In Sweden, where the weather is very similar, they have a few options. One of them are homeless shelters where they are allowed to spend the night, many times they are operated by the church. Another one is that they find an absolutely horrible (probably illegal) shack to live in which doesn't constitute as a home. Some break-in in places such as stairwells (there were some for a short while where I live) and cellars and what not. Others sleep outside (or almost outside) where there is no snow or very little of it with multiple sleeping bags.

Another problem is that Romani beggars may not have documentation. Legally their children might not even exist in Romania. Bureaucratically it makes a complex situation since despite it being obvious where they are from it probably has to be proven legally. With Romania joining the Schengen Area it might add another obstacle for deportation. Also there will be nothing stopping them from coming back once if they're deported.

The fact that you brought up death camps is disgusting. The death camps we've had in Europe is our greatest shame. Here are solutions which actually seem to work. Since are now Romani beggars are a European problem and not only a Romanian one all EU countries + countries it cooperates with should help fund such programs which can be extended further to help homeless people and young people having problems finding a new home.

There's a certain theme occurring, that states which participate with one another through the EU do not get into conflicts with one another. Before anybody says 'but what about Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland, Norway': They're EEA members and benefit from EU integration similar to how full EU members do. It's very easy to just assume that post WWII things just became 'different' and yes they did, but that doesn't mean we're incapable of losing our empathy for common Europeans. For a lot of people it's still very hard to empathise with our common humans in the Middle East, Africa and East Asia. Historical forces have lead European nations towards greater co-operation, in order to further the cause of peace and prosperity. Of course there are other forms it could have taken, rather than the EU as we know it today, but there are a lot of good reasons that the EU took the form it did. For instance, the level of economic co-dependence we have necessitates a giving up of sovereignty in order to manage economic policy, so it's hard to imagine a peaceful Europe where some kind of European supra-national entity exists in order to direct the process. So all of the viable alternative ways we could have achieved a peaceful Europe basically include some kind of quais-EU structure and for that reason, we should at acknowledge its roll at celebrations like the centenary of WWI for halting the repetition of violence between European peoples.

Right now, Juncker's mandate is inherited from the national parties and political contexts of the individual member states. It's not good enough for a position so powerful.

If by banning begging you also solve the social issues which lead to begging (which I believe Norway already did), yes. You have absolutely no moral justification to start begging if you have a social security system which can and will actually help you if you need it.


What to do with beggars which still beg comes next. 

This is the tricky question, because I hate to break it to you, but those people do not have any ID cards, simply because they don't bother reporting childbirth anywhere. If you expect the police to find any document on them, be prepared for a shock, those people don't even have a birth certificate. It's not that they destroy it to avoid being deported to their country of origin, they simply have never bothered obtaining one in the first place.

You cannot integrate into any society if you don't even have a traceable and non-repudiable identity, rendering you liable for punishment if you disobey the law. 

This is the first impediment which stands against reacting to them, way before the debate of being politically correct or not. 


The second impediment would be the lack of education. Most of them are illiterate, further destroying any little chance they had in integrating. You cannot break this vicious cycle of living undocumented / and being illiterate that easily.

It might be possible for the younger generations, as long as child protection services and organizations like UNICEF kick in and start building schools, but you need to isolate them from the bad environment they have ""at home"", otherwise they'll just drop out. 


This means literally separating families, and sending their children to orphanages on reasons of parental neglect ( which undoubtedly might be better than where they are living now), but this is the politically correctness debate I'm not interested in taking part in.

Yes I read them and it's in those that you called it anti-democratic after which cyridius I think asked if you meant undemocratic. 

&gt;Right now, Juncker's mandate is inherited from the national parties and political contexts of the individual member states. It's not good enough for a position so powerful. Better to keep them appointed by the European Council until the parliament can grow into a proper parliament with proper politicians.

What?

You're confusing me here. 
It's not a proper parliament now and the politicians are not proper politicians? Even if that were the perception of some tabloid munchers wouldn't allowing it to influence this election better that perception?

&gt;in a democracy their first point of engagement should be with the people. That means putting out their message and making the press want to cover them. Then you can claim to have a mandate. 

And how exactly? What do you want the EU to do?
Spout some they are ""terking yer jerbs"" lines?

Maybe the national governments can put some focus on it but that clearly wouldn't have been in Cameron's interest imo.

In other words, an absence of democracy rather than something that attempts to take away democracy.

Er, maybe. I chose anti-democratic because I see it as an attempt to disguise an undemocratic process as a democratic one, and use its supposed democratic status to justify a grab for power.

&gt;But a big part of the trouble is much of what the EU parliament does is distant from the people

Is it? I'm sure plenty of it is, plenty of stuff that goes on in national parliaments is distant from people and boring. More so in the European parliament? I'm not sure. Maybe. There's still the ability of the candidates to sell themselves to the people - explain why they are the most credible and trustworthy and competent person to be the President of the European Commission.

&gt;That's not to say I disagree that they need to engage more, they should also be running more under their european grouping not their national party and that should be fairly fixed what grouping they're in before the election not after.

I think the European groupings system is absurd. There should be political groups, of course, but they shouldn't be something formally arranged with the parliament. They should be an arrangement that exists entirely between the parties. There shouldn't be some weird incentive system to get together (ie more staff - why not just have it proportional to number of MEPs?) and there shouldn't be strange requirements like at least X parties from at least Y countries. That'd make it easier to have them arranged and on the ticket.

&gt;I think they didn't have a choice. The national governments didn't confirm or reject their idea and as you pointed out the national parties control the election campaigns.

It's a good point.

&gt;There is a problem there but pushing ahead with their plan is the best course of action.

I think establishing popular support for the principle of an elected president is the first course of action. I think they didn't do that, because they know that that's a step towards federalism and federalism isn't as widely supported in real life as it is in the parliament. But with that support, there's not much the European Council can do to stop them pushing their candidate.

&gt;If they gave in to the council then next election they'd be back at square one.

I think they need to go back to square one and re-think the way they're doing things. I think they're approaching this whole thing wrong, with an idea of the people as an inconvenience that needs to be overcome, rather than a body of real people that need to be engaged and consulted.

It's the replacement of nationalist myths, typically flag based, for a federalist myth based on a flag. It's supposedly a more agreeable myth, but not for me. 

The Yugoslav Wars did happen, however inconvenient, and Ukraine isn't doing too grandly, and just about every EU member state was part of ISAF. 

The reason why there's little taste for fighting in the rest of Europe is down just to the people, not governments. Even if our governments tried to get us to fight each other we simply wouldn't do it, we'd refuse due largely to the wars last century but also becuase we socialise amongst ourselves and we quite like each other.

true,tusksrus,UKGB,United Kingdom | Blairite,"&gt;You're confusing me here. It's not a proper parliament now and the politicians are not proper politicians

Politicians engage the population, they lead public opinion and they gain support based on their ideas and appeal. Right now, European Parliament elections are a way for the population to take advantage of a ""joke election"" to stick their fingers up at the political class of their respective countries. I believe it is up to those who are being elected to fix this, and then we can talk about what sort of mandate emerges. Right now, it's a very passive mandate which is trumped by the heads of state and government, who did actually engage the public.

&gt;And how exactly? What do you want the EU to do? Spout some they are ""terking yer jerbs"" lines?

I'm not sure what you're suggesting with the second bit, but to be clear I'm not some racist shill from UKIP. I think the president is ultimately a position which should be elected, but there are certain prerequisites before I can consider him to actually meet the definition of the term ""elected"" - it's about more than just votes.

&gt;And how exactly?

A starting point could be to launch a Europe-wide campaign for the Spitzencandidaten process, instead of just wrestling with the European Council to the exclusion of the people of Europe. It's already seen as distant, why give up the opportunity to engage on a major constitutional change? That's what I mean by not ""proper politicians"".

&gt;Maybe the national governments can put some focus on it but that clearly wouldn't have been in Cameron's interest imo.

Not in the interest of any Euroskeptic to campaign on a pro-federalist issue. Parties like the Conservatives would campaign against the Spitzencandidaten process, with their own points against.

&gt;And that all of a sudden makes it ""democratic"" in Belgium but not in the UK? Berlusconi must have been the most democratic leader in ages in Italy.

Well, arguably. I mean, he lasted a long time, didn't he? I'm not sure I get your meaning, though. What I mean is that Europe is more or less based in Brussels (with some other buildings not in Belgium). Belgium's also quite a small country. EU affairs probably do take up a larger amount of air-time, there's probably more interest.

But I'm saying that it's up to the politicians to engage the public, *then* they can claim to have a mandate. Right now MEPs just exist to soak up votes from a joke election.

*Politics*

* The US envoy to OSCE [spoke out against the intimidation of media and civil organizations](http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/texttrans/2014/06/20140619302354.html#axzz357fZseHt) in the country. 

* Jobbik chairman Gábor Vona was re-elected for the position yesterday with 95% of the votes. He was the only candidate. 6 VPs were also chosen, 3 retained their positions while other 3 are newcomers. 

* The new state secretary for law enforcement, László Tasnádi was inaugurated on Monday, the 25th anniversary of democratic Hungary (see below). He turned out to be a former agent of the III/II Division, the second most notorious division of the state police during socialist times. He stated that he had only done anti-terrorism and -surveillance activities during his time and did not report on civilians as many of his colleagues' job was to. 

* [Orbán reiterated that he does not support the candidacy of Juncker](http://www.politics.hu/20140617/orban-rejects-supporting-german-backed-european-commission-candidate/) just as he promised during his EP campaign. 

* [RTL Klub's news are hilariously sharp since the passing of the ad tax last week](http://www.politics.hu/20140618/rtl-klub-gets-tough-on-orban/) (compared to the previously mostly neutral, slightly left leaning stance of theirs). Fidesz politicians don't like that. The best critique they come up with was that family members of politicians were featured in reports, however the family member in question (father of Viktor Orbán, Győző Orbán) has really shady mining deals ongoing which justify reporting. They also reported on the case of theft at Orbán's daughter's wedding where two iPhones were stolen, worth 1.000€ total. The investigation (and DNA analysis) have cost taxpayers about 15.000€ so far. [János Lázár has accused RTL of ""treating the country as a colony"", whatever that means](http://www.politics.hu/20140620/lazar-reportedly-accuses-rtl-of-treating-hungary-as-colony/). 

* The Norwegian Civil Funds-gate quieted down a bit this week, [but some involved organizations refused to share information with the investigative authority KEHI](http://www.politics.hu/20140620/ngo-says-wont-co-operate-with-govt-investigation/) (which has no authority, Fidesz just forces the thing through), but instead published all the documents in question on their websites for anyone to see as a form of protest. Meanwhile the government have sent yet another official letter to the Norwegians, asking them to resume funding. They didn't address any of the outstanding issues or indicate willingness to change the current stance, they just want the money to flow again. 

* [The Daily Mail discovered the 2-year old Hungarian citizenship scheme](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2664229/Half-million-EU-passports-given-away-eastern-Europeans-Hungary-allow-live-Britain.html) for people with ancestors from the Austro-Hungarian Empire and naturally did what they do best: wrote a fear-mongering article about it.

* [After the end of campaigning, former PM Gordon Bajnai retracts from his leadership positions](http://www.politics.hu/20140620/bajnai-pulls-back-from-front-line/) to focus on being ""the opposition outside the Parliament"" during the current term. He won an MP seat during the elections, but decided to give it away to other members of his party. 

* [Barroso will address the meeting of the Visegrád Four](http://www.politics.hu/20140620/barroso-to-address-budapest-v4-meeting-on-june-24/), the regional alliance of Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Poland in their upcoming meeting in Budapest.

*Economy*

* [The biggest news of the week came on Monday when the Supreme Court ruled in the forex loans case](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/19/hungary-fxloans-idUKL6N0OZ2VS20140619). They ruled in favor of the people in all 3 questions of the table. It was decided that it was unlawful for banks to unilaterally change the loan conditions, except under very strict circumstances. It was also ruled unfair that the banks neglected to fully inform the clients of the possibilities (what happens if the then-great H - aUF/CHF rate goes to the shitter) of the contract. Furthermore the use of the exchange rate spread was also deemed unfair (clients paid their monthlies using the currency's Sell rate, but they received the loan based on the Buy rate). The Supreme Court ordered to pay back the unfairly collected amount of money to the clients, which is about 400 billion HUF, about 3000€ per client on average. Now that the ruling is done, [Fidesz will prepare a bill to execute it](http://www.politics.hu/20140616/rogan-fidesz-will-write-bill-to-make-banks-reimburse-fx-debtors/), but it will likely only come in the Autumn. 

* [Orbán stated he wants to see all leading TV channels in Hungarian hands ""one way or another""](http://www.politics.hu/20140616/orban-wants-to-reportedly-boost-hungarian-ownership-of-media/), just like he set the goal of 50% of the bank sector to be Hungarian owned two years ago. He said the ad tax is just and they didn't do it for the budget boost, but for justice. 

* After forcibly lowering water prices twice already through bills, a Fidesz expert told main right wing paper Magyar Nemzet that he believes the [water market should be nationalized to ensure supply safety and low prices](http://www.politics.hu/20140616/legal-expert-tells-magyar-nemzet-water-services-should-be-nationalized/). 

* After months of planning, Hungarian low-cost carrier[ WizzAir pulled out of its planned IPO](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/16/budget-airline-wizz-air-pulls-ipo) on the London Stock Exchange citing market volatility. 

* A prime real estate, the former [Ballet Institute](http://budapest.utisugo.hu/_Images/ismertetok/latnivalok/000698094_1.jpg.jpg_orig.jpg) on the main avenue of Budapest with luxury stores abound in the vicinity [was sold to a Qatari sheikh](http://www.politics.hu/20140619/qatari-sheikh-buys-ballet-institute/) by the Portuguese owners. They plan to turn it into a boutique hotel. 

* Resident dicknugget János Lázár (Minister of the Prime Minister's Office) was named as the chief negotiator to EU for 2014-2020. He is the one causing all the ruckus about the Norwegian Civil Fund grants and a frontrunner in Fidesz's anti-EU campaign where they demand ""respect for Hungarians"" anytime the EU disagrees with anything ever. 

* [A bill on reinforcing life without parole in the judicial system is expected to be passed in the Autumn](http://www.politics.hu/20140619/govt-to-submit-bill-on-real-life-imprisonment-in-autumn/). To soften the blow, they plan to regulate the appeal process in more detail.

*Misc*

* Monday marked the 25th anniversary of the democratic Hungary. It was on this day in 1989 when heroes of the 1956 Revolution (Imre Nagy, PM; Pál Malétre, Minister of Military; and Pál Gimes - all were executed after a military trial in 1956) were re-buried, which event is also considered a milestone for the free and democratic country. [Relatives of 1956 martyr protested that the state ceremonies cumulated to a free pop concert on Heroes' Square where the headliner was the German band Scorpions](http://www.politics.hu/20140616/relatives-of-1956-martyrs-protest-against-anniversary-concerts/). 

* A Dutch distance hiker went missing in the Bakony mountain range on Tuesday when completing part of the longest hike of the country, the Blue Tour. His family shared his picture and information on Facebook and Hungarian news sites also reported him as missing. As it turned out yesterday he was safe all along, he just turned his phone to airplane mode to save battery life and didn't bother to check. 

* [Socialist MP challenged Viktor Orbán to live off of the current minimum wage, 66.500Fts \(~210€\) for a month](http://www.politics.hu/20140619/socialist-mp-challenges-orban-to-live-from-minimum-wage-for-one-month/) by offering him an envelope filled with the amount. He said this way the government would have a more realistic idea about the way people live. 

* [Saturday marked the 70th anniversary of deportation of Jews from Budapest, from the so-called ""Yellow star"" houses](http://www.politics.hu/20140620/saturday-events-recall-yellow-star-houses-from-holocaust-era/), when Jews of the city had to move in to a selected 2000 tenements of the city, marked with yellow stars of David. A civil movement for people to rediscover the history of the houses that still exist today was started earlier this year. 

* Saturday evening we also had our annual [Long Night of the Museums](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Night_of_Museums). An amateur actor died while performing an interpretation of A Midsummer Night's Dream in Pápa, Western Hungary during the event. 

* Football fans were rooting for Bosnia-Herzegovina as the only player from the Hungarian football championship at the World Cup is their starting centre-back, Muhamed Besic. He was in both games and in a good form against Argentina. Too bad they got eliminated. [It would be a surprise if he wouldn't return to a more notable league after the competition.](http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3841/world-cup-2014/2014/06/21/4900927/from-obscurity-to-facing-messi-the-fall-and-rise-of-muhamed)

lmgtfy.com/?q=propaganda &lt;- if you want to know something neutral about your country, you look for sources OUTSIDE your country. It's the same reason a judge can't have links to one of the parties in a trial, because it clouds judgement. Are you really that convinced that pro-independence parties *have absolutely no agenda, nor bias*, but the EU who would actually win by having Catalonia inside the EU, according to you, are complete idiots?

&gt; You might need that link, you seem to confuse opinions vs statemens from institutions, not people (yes, I had fun doing that, the internet is full of crap)

Give me a link to an official document that ensures the no-exit of break-away regions like Catalonia, Scotland (it will be easier, because they're closer to independence than Catalonia), Flanders, Padania. Any document that refers to one of these regions will do. 

&gt; ERC and almost every single party in Catalonia are all pro-EU, and so are the catalans. They are pushing for an independent Catalonia inside the EU, but for that to happen we need to be independent first, don't we?

It doesn't matter if pro-independence parties in Catalonia are pro-EU, it's the EU that will decide whether they accept Catalonia or not (they will, don't worry, just not right of the bat).

&gt; That's the main problem now.

Sure. But it would be nice to tell people the truth, so they can cast an informed vote. The vote of many Catalans would not be the same depending on the outcome of independence. That's why the PP implies Catalonia will be on par with some sub-saharian country, while ERC/CiU/ANC paints it as the new Finland, *inside* the EU.

- Generalizing is different from demanding equal rights and justice. We have none these days. Hiding behind generalizations and crying discrimination delays solutions. Creates noise. The only generalization I make is towards the voters who keep electing ethnocentric chauvinists, however cloaked they present themselves. People need to take responsibility for what happens and not deny it later, saying they didn't knew what was going on. That excuse won't stick anymore. Goes for all countries, weak and strong.

true,project_apex,NETH,Not Deutsch,"&gt; It's the replacement of nationalist myths, typically flag based, for a federalist myth based on a flag. It's supposedly a more agreeable myth, but not for me.

The point I was trying to make is that this flag should **not** represent a federal Europe. 

The flag is originally the flag of the [Council of Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe). The Council of Europe, founded by someone [you might know](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) it comprehended the basic idea that changed the course of European history: coorperation and debate in stead of war and fighting.

However, the flag was later incorporated by the European Union as their  own. This is too bad because now the flag is used as a representative of the EU and its policies in stead of what it originally stood for: cooperation and debate.

&gt;The Yugoslav Wars did happen, however inconvenient, and Ukraine isn't doing too grandly, and just about every EU member state was part of ISAF.

Of course it hasn't been 100% peaceful. But if you 'zoom out' and look at European history the last 500 years the wars and fighting we have seen in the past years are, however tragic for the people involved, minor events. 

&gt;The reason why there's little taste for fighting in the rest of Europe is down just to the people, not governments. 

I think that the EU has contributed to this though. Forcing politicians to debate over stuff in stead of threatening with economic sanctions and even war has changed the mindset people have about other countries. In 3 generations we went from being a Europe were we fought the most deadly and destructive wars among each other to a Europe where economic sanctions and 'bigger gun diplomacy' is ruled out as a way of changing things.

So, I agree with you that the EU isn't responsible for the peace in Europe. But the EU is the product of a new mindset in Europe that started right after WW2. This kind of mindset was what the Council of Europe was founded to promote. And it worked. I just think that it is sad that the European Union sort of 'hijacked' the flag and changed it from a symbol for European cooperation to a symbol of a federal EU.

true,fauxgosse,FRAN,France,"Ah, the 'political compass'. In my opinion it is extremely biased and skewed in so many areas that it doesn't produce accurate results at all.

There is a lot to criticise, but I'll make two main points based on what I perceive to be factual errors.

1. &gt;[The chart also makes clear that, despite popular perceptions, the opposite of fascism is not communism but anarchism \(ie liberal socialism\), and that the opposite of **communism ( i.e. an entirely state-planned economy)** is neo-liberalism (i.e. extreme deregulated economy)](http://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2)

 In what world is communism a ""state-planned economy""? Communism is common ownership of the means of production ('the economy') with the simultaneous **absence of the state** as well as any form of class.

 The entire idea of the 'state' in marxism is for it to be the tool that allows the working class to exert control over society (= socialism, the famous ""Dictatorship of the proletariat""). Communism is the absence of classes and therefore the abolition of the 'state'. If you don't believe me in this, here is Marx commenting on the ""necessary"" transition from socialism to communism:

 &gt;[[...] (2) that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat; [and] (3) that this dictatorship, itself, constitutes no more than a transition to the abolition of all classes and to a classless society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat#Karl_Marx)



2. In fact equating communism, socialism and marxism with 'left wing' is outright ignorant. Wikipedia gives a better definition of 'left wing':

 &gt;[In left-right politics, left-wing politics are political positions or activities that accept or **support social equality**, often in opposition to social hierarchy and social inequality. It is typically justified on the basis of **concern for those** in society **who are perceived as disadvantaged** relative to others and an assumption that there are **unjustified inequalities that need to be reduced** or abolished.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics)

 Equating 'right wing' with 'neoliberalism' is very questionable as well. Right- and left-wing are not economic ideologies but different ways of looking at society. From that different economic ideologies are created. Social democracy is not more or less 'left-wing' than (real) socialism, they are merely different ways of engaging the same problem (= social inequality).

Bullshit. Everyone has the rights to their own opinions and beliefs, period. Doesn't matter if they're Romanian. Doesn't matter if they're Muslim. Doesn't matter if they're Palestinian. Doesn't matter as a communist. If you're not hurting anyone, then it's not a problem.

&gt;Since you're American and know this from your own country experience, let me ask you if you would allow isolating black people at the back of the bus?

Of course not. But that's an entirely different situation. Forcing blacks to the back of the bus is an *action*. It has a direct impact on things they are allowed to do. 

The guys sitting on the beach creeping on people in OP's story aren't stopping anyone from swimming, they're just being dicks. It's an unfair comparison.

I didn't say that this was acceptable, and it has nothing to do with what OP was reporting. 

Now, if in OP's story the people who were watching the swimmers actually approached them, and attempted to force them to either put more clothes on, or stop swimming, or take more clothes off, or whatever, that would be different.

There's enough power between the EPP and the Socialists to make that happen, if they *really* want a democratic, federal Europe. What they're doing is to try and build a superpower from the top, up. It's not how nations are built. For too long has it been seen as the media's job to dictate the national (international?) conversation.

Furthermore it shows us that the makers were sloppy in their rhetoric at best. They made their survey anonymous and the responses wouldn't be recorded to make sure that people would not give socially wanted answers. Well, surprise, it doesn't work that way. People still feel society's pressure. It is why you should wonder about whether your questions bias respondents to answer a question in a certain way. This has not been done in this survey.       
Furthermore, whether or not one is homophobic or disliking abstract art does not show whether he or she is authoritarian. It is a stretch at best  and I don't think my answers would have been any different if I actually thought Plato's Politeia described the ideal state or we needed a strong (wo)man as a leader.        
On top of that this questionnaire has no way of giving a neutral or ""I don't know/care"" as an answer. This is legitimized by saying it makes people ""really evaluate their feelings"". The makers don't even consider it bad that this questionnaire is not measuring opinions but shaping them. This makes any result of this questionnaire scientifically invalid.

true,shozy,IREL,Ireland,"&gt;Er, maybe. I chose anti-democratic because I see it as an attempt to disguise an undemocratic process as a democratic one, and use its supposed democratic status to justify a grab for power.

The process itself isn't undemocratic though. It's very close to being the same process to how prime ministers are usually chosen. The people elect a parliament and then parliament elects a prime minister, usually from the biggest party. You wouldn't call that process undemocratic would you?

&gt;More so in the European parliament? I'm not sure. Maybe. 

I'd say certainly. The things people care the most about, education, healthcare, taxes, social welfare, defence are all primarily national. Other things like migration the parliament can't do anything about either.

Also even with those many national parliaments *are* suffering from the same lack of engagement the EU parliament suffers from.

&gt;There's still the ability of the candidates to sell themselves to the people - explain why they are the most credible and trustworthy and competent person to be the President of the European Commission.

They had I think 4 or 5 debates but they didn't get advertised much in the media. So it's not like they didn't try at all. They were widely available if you knew about them and went looking for them. They were *incredibly* boring though and I say that as someone who occasionally puts on a stream of my parliament when there's nothing else on. 

&gt;I think the European groupings system is absurd.

Yeah that's certainly in need of reform.

&gt;I think establishing popular support for the principle of an elected president is the first course of action.

They announced their plans before the election and then had the election and the parties in favour of their plan maintained control. In my mind they have no better way to establish if they may continue with the plan available to them, that is how democracy has always worked in practice. Representative democracy is not rule by opinion poll and focus group. 

&gt;that's a step towards federalism

The democratically elected national governments have also had plenty of chances to say they will not support their plan and they still could oppose them and they will continue to have that opportunity next time. For that reason it is not a step towards federalism. The Council hasn't lost any power, they just didn't work together to provide an alternative that they were all happy with.

&gt;I think they're approaching this whole thing wrong

I see no difference between how they're approaching things and how national parties are approaching things. I agree it's not good enough but I think too much is blamed on ""Europe"" when it's a failure of national governments.

I also think part of the problem is our low expectations of pretty much all the institutions vital to a healthy democracy. The media, the politicians (national and european), even the courts. Now the bigger part of the problem is those low expectations prove accurate so much of the time but why would an honest sensitive person ever become a politician in the current climate?",0,1403453943,null,0,false,0,cie3qe6,t3_28q94t,t1_cie3qe6,t1_cie1z96,null,1434352229,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

You can't rent a flat alone anywhere in Europe or North America while making minimum wage. Christ, I have friends working managerial jobs in the US who still live with roommates, because they'd rather have an awesome room in an amazing location than an alright flat somewhere in a crappy location by themselves.

Anyway, tthe stats for Poland are a lie. Millions of poles between 26 and 35 are still officially ""registered"" as living with their parents, even though they've moved to (usually) larger cities. Most landlords won't you register as living at their flat, as that would give you legal rights to the flat itself. Having a non-large-city address also lets you get cheaper car insurance, and your mom can handle your tax stuff, etc. I know people in their mid 30s who've lived in Warsaw for 15 years and are still officially ""registered"" as living with their parents.

The registration problem is actually a pretty big, as people pay income tax in the place where they're registered as living, not where they actually live and work. So you have ~2.5 mln people living and working in Warsaw, while only ~1.8mln of them pay taxes here. Most people will only register after buying a flat here, which means they'll do it around 30-34.

There was a hilarious incident a few years ago. A large new development (20-30 *thousand* flats) had been built in southern Warsaw (*Miasteczko Wilanów*) and the residents organized a town hall meeting about having a preschool built somewhere in the development or next to it. A representative from the city showed up, took the microphone and said, ""According to our official figures, there are 200 people registered as living in this entire development, we see no reason to build a preschool here.

true,tusksrus,UKGB,United Kingdom | Blairite,"&gt;It's very close to being the same process to how prime ministers are usually chosen. [...] You wouldn't call that process undemocratic would you?

In theory it's not, but there is supposed to be a chain. Prime Ministers *are* personally elected in a similar way to Presidents in practice, and they *do* derive personal legitimacy from that. At least, that's my view. Now, I've not come here straight from UKIP advocating direct democracy and referenda every five minutes - that's too far in the opposite direction, but I *do* think that a Prime Minister who was selected by his parliament but didn't seek approval from the public is not *as* legitimate as a Prime Minister who did. If there's a long standing tradition of Prime Ministers being personally selected by the party then it's fine if Gordon Brown comes along every once in a while, he's still the PM (although it would be better to call an election at that point). I reject the prospect of the first one doing it, particularly against a backdrop of an election notable for the rise of eurosceptic parties.

&gt;I'd say certainly.

I'll defer to your knowledge in this, then. But the EPP and the Socialist groups could get together and campaign for the principle of choosing their own candidates, in a bid to force the European Council to a decision, or otherwise engage public opinion to persuade it. Doing nothing and just fighting it out politician-to-politician without engaging the public, *precisely when they claim to derive legitimacy from that same public*, is not the way I would build *my* federal Europe.

&gt;Also even with those many national parliaments are suffering from the same lack of engagement the EU parliament suffers from.

Absolutely, it's a problem politicians everywhere face. They need to engage the public, the public isn't going to come to them when the public isn't even fully aware of their existence and importance. Which brings me to the next point:

&gt;They had I think 4 or 5 debates but they didn't get advertised much in the media. So it's not like they didn't try at all.

Well this could be me in my own UK bubble, but I'd never heard of any of the broadcasters. If we can have Eurovision, we can have proper televised debates. The EPP and the Socialists should push for it, and push for it loudly. Similarly to how in the last election here in the UK the media pushed the parties for televised debates. It's how democracies do things, what we got was an obscure debate about an obscure position on an obscure online channel. And it wasn't even interesting? No way does it count as engagement.

&gt;They announced their plans before the election and then had the election and the parties in favour of their plan maintained control

Well, they ticked all the boxes so they can tell the people that they should have been paying closer attention. I don't think that's a fair and democratic way to engage the public.

&gt;Representative democracy is not rule by opinion poll and focus group.

No, but my point is it would pressure the European Council into accepting the proposed convention that the parliament chooses the president. Right now it's a group of people who soak up votes from an election that isn't taken seriously, claiming to be the legitimate representatives of the people , telling this to the *heads of national government*? Against a backdrop of the rise of eurosceptic parties, it's not a convincing argument that it's the right thing to do.

&gt;I see no difference between how they're approaching things and how national parties are approaching things

It's not massively, I think Europe is a worse case but it's basically the same. It's a reason not to set up another layer of it, though, and dilute what little political talent there is.

&gt;low expectations

It's a good point. Politics needs a leader. Either in Europe or a national government. Someone who can really speak to the people and their party, and the other parties, and bring them on side, command their respect. Someone who's a real statesman.

Anyway, I don't know how you can say such a sentence with a straight face, after the Jubilympics.

&gt; Flying the EU flag is not some decision that people reach through reason: it represents a political position.

Firstly, I don't see why political positions should be incompatible with reason. Indeed, I prefer to reach my political positions through reason, something which also used to be a valuable British tradition.

Secondly, flying pretty much any flag can represent a political position. Flying the Union Jack in certain parts of Northern Ireland (or, these days, anywhere in Scotland) certainly represents a political position. Yet, if Gerry Adams or Alex Salmond told you not to fly the Union Jack in, say, Sussex, in order to respect his precious sensitivities, you'd rightfully tell him to get stuffed. And I'd applaud you.

&gt; Well no, of course they do, but they are the ones who understand the problem because they are facing it themselves and working it to solve it.

So, the EU facing Scotland having its referendum this year, Catalonia maybe, Flanders soon declaring it unilateral, etc. You think they're not facing it? They're not thinking about it? I'd say that's myopia, you decide whether their myopia, or yours (if you're absolutely convinced there's no talk about those regions in the EU). 

&gt; You know, asking for a document that states the non-existence of a law doesn't make much sense. That's the point, there is no law for break away nations.

There is: international law. Plus, highly-placed officials all state Catalonia would exit. I think you should at least give a European official (be it the EU, be it the European Counsel, those are two different unrelated organs) that says break-away regions stay in. You know, to show that there's at least some disagreement (don't cite Catalan pro-independence EU deputies, unless they refer to an existing document).

&gt; we'll be out of the EU probably due to interpretations of internation law, and that's a whole new level of crap. 

Doesn't matter whether it's crap. It's there, and it will be followed.

&gt; I wouldn't go as far as saying that (at least in many of the independentist parties statements)

You must be kidding. Pro-consulta parties maybe, but pro-independence  parties are as *neutral* as the contras (not a single bit). 

&gt; due to the fact that they are defending the secession and need to back their claims

They shouldn't, they should ask the people. They should defend the consulta. Why change Españistan for Catalunyistan? If Catalonia breaks-away without asking its people it's no better than the rest of Spain. 

&gt; imagine what would PP and such parties do if they didn't

You tell me. 

&gt; so they are in general more reliable

How so? Because it's biased in the way you like more? I can equally claim Barcelona should return to its roots and become a county again, Barcelona as an independent state. I can back that up with a history older than Catalonia, and because a city always pays more than the hinterland, I could even make an economic point out of it that there are transfers. That doesn't make me less biased than Spanish or Catalan nationalists, I just love Barcelona.

I can see the logic behind it, but it is wrong.  It essentially plays up the false dichotomy of labor rights vs. American-style übercapitalist shithole.  It also assumes that this is a zero sum game in terms of money in circulation (disregarding the fact that it will open up more slots to people who _want_ to work, as well as more part-time jobs in retail, not to mention leaving people like me more flexibility to work during the week.)  There are very few legitimate arguments against Sunday retail (e.g. increased traffic), and even these are only a question of tweaking policy correctly.

Generally, this attitude tends to be propagated by people who either don't understand basic economics, or have this feeling that ""_I_ can plan my shopping, and I don't feel you should have anything catered to that _I_ don't need"".  I find it arrogant and intolerant, but unfortunately it is very common in the countries I've lived in (Switzerland, Germany, France).  

The absolute best one I've heard (Switzerland) from a crusty old labor union spokesman was that stores shouldn't open longer to accommodate people who work during the day because the women in the family should just go do the shopping.

The first steps were to foster economic cooperation: the idea being that countries who trade with one another become economically interdependent and so more likely to avoid conflict. The result was the European Economic Community (EEC), created in 1958, and initially increasing economic cooperation between six countries: Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Since then, a huge single market has been created and continues to develop towards its full potential.*

The big news are the World Cup elimination and the new king and you know both.

* Spain has been eliminated from the World cup.
* The government is working in a fiscal reform to reduce income taxes to middle and higher earners, but [the severance pay tax exemptions will fall to 2000 euros/year](http://www.abc.es/economia/20140620/abci-despido-pago-irpf-201406192125.html)(before the severance pays were tax free, and at this country some years 3% of the GDP has been severance pays), reducing the corporate tax for big companies to the same rate as SME(25%), and a flat rate capital gains replacing the current progressive one.

 * TLDR: The classical right-wing tax reform. But they haven't finished and Spain has been eliminated from the World Cup. Therefore, they have to water down the reform now.
 * Tax cuts with the debt at 100% and the deficit at 6.8%, however Spain recently raised also the VAT to basic needs and did a weird reform around the energy sector that should mean that the deficit will remain similar but with a more regressive fiscal system.
* Justice minister’s son(the second) alleged to have fled scene after crashing into several cars. *It's him or somebody was using his car.* [EN](http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/06/17/inenglish/1402996495_533225.html)

&gt; Jews think they are better than other people

&gt;People hate Jews because of the way Jews behave

All these are the fault of Israel.  
Many people equate Jews with Israel. And Israel behaves pretty badly.  
That's totally normal, people generally equate the ethnicity with its nation.  

Israel offers citizenship to all jews and often uses jews all over the world as Mossad agents.  
They constantly accuse people that are against Israel of hating Jews (like this exact thing for example).   
They manipulate the US to send them a ridiculous amount of money so they can fuck over Palestinians.  
They build settlements on Palestinian soil.  

These aren't antisemites, just people equating Israel's actions with those of all Jews. And if Israel maybe started being less shitty, it wouldn't happen.

Old people love the History, relaxing on beaches and quite areas and there is plenty of that.

Each island has unique traits for different groups, like Santorini is marketed to Young/Old married couples as a 2nd honeymoon destination(or first), Mykonos is marketed as a crazy night-life island and a place like Rhodes is marketed as an all-around Family Island with things to do for young/old. 

And then there are dozens of islands where people go to stay away from ""tourist traps"" and things like that. 

The main Tourism sector that is slowly being untapped is the ""Ultra-Wealthy"" Category and Greek tourism Minister has been working aggresively to get these people to Greece. 

Some examples is the new ""Mini-Monaco"" being built on Ithaca Island with a dozen uninhabited nearby islands being turned into LUxury Palaces by Dubai Royalty to rent out . . new F1 Racetrack+surrounding Resort area on Athens Harbor . . legalizing small private Sea-Planes for those rich people who hate travelling with us peasants ;p

1. Cameron has staked his leadership on ""Fallacy of the Middle Way"" with respect to the EU eg ""REFORM"".
2. The Santer Commission in 1999 realizing ""More Integration"" was unpopular converted to using this language instead: ""REFORM"".
3. Juncker symbolizes Federalization of the EU hence ""reform"" as a political strategem via the middle way to lie to the public loses even the veneer of potential if Juncker is elected.
4. Yet Juncker has been the Number 1 candidate according to the EU's own elections rules and hence opposing him is opposing the so-called democratic reforms of the EU.
5. Cameron believed or believes he could get Merkel to support him opposing Juncker even if that meant one Federalist replaced with another - it would be a media victory to go with his previous false victories:

* Cameron's phantom veto that vetoed nothing and was by-passed by inter-governmental agreements
* Cameron's EU budget cut that 6 months later led to an increase in the EU budget.
* Cameron's ""cast-iron guarantee"" of a referendum has already failed x1  and he's repeated it a 2nd time.
* Removing Juncker, an arch-Federalist to be replaced by another Federalist.

Of course the media would and had reported all of these bar the ""cast-iron dave"" as REFORM VICTORIES.

**TL;DR**: Cameron's political pragmatism relies solely on the success of waging a **phoney war** on the EU; as he is on record as saying:

1. Cameron is Pro-EU
2. Cameron would vote to stay in the EU even without managing to get concessions/reform.
3. Reform in the EU is IMPOSSIBLE according to the criteria for a super-Treaty renegotiation for 2017 on multiple criteria and backed up by multiple primary sources of evidence.
4. The success of the ""Reform Fallacy"" relies on the lack of the public understanding of EEA = Single Market - Political Union vs EU = Political Union + Single Market as a legitimate option. EEA is conflated with Reform in the EU instead.
5. THe #euFUD of leaving the EU Political Union without understanding that EEA option exists is the main driver for the Middle Way Fallacy of Reform policy that Cameron commandeers.
6. Cameron never ever mentions the only authentic formal channel for renegotiation that moves away from ""Ever Closer Union (1957)"" = Article 50 TEU Lisbon Treaty.

Finally ""reform in the EU"" = [**Cat gets caught barking by a human and resumes meowing**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP3gzee1cps)

true,Jallenbah,ENGL,England,"&gt;The EU is controlled by the leaders of European countries, and by MEPs. MEPs are chosen by voting in the European elections, and obviously our leader is chosen as the result of a general election. We have representation proportional to our population, and demanding more would be undemocratic.

A vote for UKIP is a vote to leave the EU, that's the whole point. People are voting to not have laws dictated to them by MEPs they didn't vote for. There are more MEPs who aren't from the UK than who are, so you do the maths, will the voters get the policies they voted for if our MEPs decision is overruled by a majority vote from foreign MEPs?

&gt;The government pays a sum towards EU membership. This figure takes no account of how much money UK individuals and businesses receive as a result of EU trade.

Sure, like I said I didn't vote UKIP. I would question however what the actual net gain / loss is from paying the EU / getting the trade benefits is, and why this isn't more common knowledge. You would think it would be either ammo for pro-EU or anti-EU parties depending on what the answer really is.

&gt;Mass immigration only occurs if there are jobs available. The UK is hardly a socialist paradise so if immigrants really did just want to freeload they'd be stupid to come here. In fact, immigrants are much more likely to be in work than native citizens.

That doesn't mean that people won't be upset at the numbers of immigrants. There are hundreds of thousands of unemployed UK citizens and I doubt any of them are thrilled at the idea of hundreds of thousands of other people looking for work coming along and competing with them. There's that, and there's also the fact that immigration from poorer countries could potentially (not saying it will or won't, I'm not in a position of knowledge to say, but people could easily make the assumption) increase the expectation of employees to work for less which will ultimately weaken the UK economy.

&gt;They don't even have an official manifesto.

As I said before ""The UKIP vote is representative of peoples will to move away from a political union ... Pretty much every other aspect of UKIP has been more or less ignored"". People are voting for what they feel is an important issue, as they have thus far not been provided with a referendum.


Ultimately I think it's bigoted to dismiss a UKIP vote as ""offensive"". They have legitimate concerns which need to be addressed, either with education on how the issues that worry them are not going to cause the problems they fear, or to solve the issue if they are.",0,1403459160,null,0,false,0,cie5spy,t3_28s46d,t1_cie5spy,t1_cie3a81,null,1434353201,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

true,deutscherhawk,advanced,advanced,"There are many great answers here, and you probably won't read this one at this point, but I've spent over 10 years learning German and the last 3 teaching it, and you're comment is a question which I get at least twice a week for the entire first semester.

The simple answer to your question:  Who decides what is right and wrong?  The native speakers.  If you want to really mess with your mind try to get 10 Germans to agree on what the gender for Nutella is--they won't be able to.

This leads me to arguably the most confusing part about Gender for speakers of languages without Gender:  Gender is VERY important, but the gender is assigned rather arbitrarily.  Just because there doesn't seem to be some logic behind it, does NOT mean that it's not important.  Other's have brought up the weird past tense or plural formations in English.  There is no real reason why ""give"" becomes ""gave"" other than THAT IS WHAT NATIVE SPEAKERS SAY.  For the same reason gender is important in German, because it's what native speakers say.

To demonstrate why gender is important, it's probably helpful to remember that German uses a more complex case system than English, with clear distinctions between the nominative, accusative, and dative.  The example I always use with my students is ""The dog bites the man"" (Der Hund beißt den Mann).  In English, if you switch these words around, the sentence completely changes.  ""The man bites the dog"" has a completely different meaning because the function of the nouns depends on word order (since the man comes first, it is now the subject of the sentence).  In German however, you can switch those words because the subject of the sentence is determined by case, and NOT word order, so the sentence: ""Den Mann beißt der Hund"" means the exact same thing, since the ""Der Hund"" is in the nominative, and is thus the subject of the sentence even if it comes later.

Hopefully that clears up why gender matters.  I really wish I could tell you some magical formula for learning genders, but it doesn't exist, and even then some words there is just no universal accepted Gender (like Nutella mentioned above).

Now, because Gender is important, but it's completely arbitrary, how do you learn it?  Well, I have two or three techniques that I recommend to my students.

1) memorize the word with the article.  The German word for ""house"" is not ""Haus"", it is ""Das Haus"".  The German word for ""father"" is not ""Vater"", it is ""der Vater"" 

2) Make yourself flashcards or a vocab cribsheet, and highlight each word in a different color depending on the gender.  Blue for der, green for das, yellow for die or something.  Having a color connected to the word might help you remember the correct gender, I've had many students make significant breakthroughs using this method.

3)Learn the few rules.  If it ends in -ung the word will be ""die"".  If it ends in -chen the word will be ""das"".  If it ends in ""-e"" it will PROBABLY be ""die"" (some notable exceptions, like ""der Name"").  

4)Finally, once you learn some of the grammar changes, you can learn gender's through reverse engineering.  If you know you've heard the phrase ""dieses Jahr"", you know that Jahr is ""das"", because that's the only way to have ""dieses"".


Look, Gender is confusing.  It, along with the case system, is the bane of all English speakers who try to learn German.  I still make mistakes all the time, and constantly have to check myself on Gender despite my extensive experience. (Over a decade learning the language, living in Germany for 2 years, and 3 years teaching).  So after everything else I typed above, this next sentence is the single most important sentence you can ever hear for learning German--or any language for that matter:

YOU WILL MAKE MISTAKES!  YOU WILL MAKE A LOT OF MISTAKES AND SOME OF THEM WILL BE VERY EMBARASSING AND RATHER FUNNY TO NATIVE SPEAKERS!  ALL OF THIS IS OKAY!  IT IS BETTER TO TRY TO SPEAK AND SAY SOMETHING HORRIFICALLY WRONG AND LEARN THEN TO NOT SPEAK JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE UNSURE OF SOMETHING!

My first week in Germany I proudly told my host family that the weather was very gay.  I also strongly insinuated one of my friends was very lesbian, when she was very not.  All by making small grammar/pronunciation mistakes which I only figured out after my German friends stopped laughing long enough to explain what happened.  I guarantee you--I've never made those mistakes again.

Mistakes are good, mistakes are common.  Don't worry about it, just try your best, that's all anyone can ask.

I have made so many horrible mistakes that completely destroyed what I wanted to say, and that my friends have NEVER let me live it down.  And yet I am also frequently told that my German (especially spoken) is near-native, and the only reason this is the case is because I made these horrible mistakes.

If you are just starting a language it is supposed to be difficult, and you are supposed to make mistakes.  It happens and it's good.  Using German and making mistakes is a million times better than not using German for fear of making a mistake.  No matter how small, TRY TO USE YOUR GERMAN.  Try to be creative.  Try to say things on your own that aren't the pre-formed phrases in your text book like ""wie geht's"".  These are important, but German is not a code to be learned, it is a living language with all of the weirdness and confusion that every other language has.

The only way to learn is to try, and when you try you will make mistakes. It doesn't matter if you've been learning for 10 days or 10 years, you just have to try.  As Ms. Frizzle would say:  Take chances, make mistakes, get messy.  And have fun.

It can also be used to describe one's feeling or perhaps progress on something. ""How do you feel today?"" ""I'm so-so."" ""How's the project coming along?"" ""It's so-so"". Here this means neither good nor bad.

It is also used to start conversion during awkward moments. ""So....what do you want to talk about?"" Or ""so.... how about this weather?"".

""So what?"" means ""who cares?"" an impolite way of saying you're not interested in something or that something is not actually important. ""I bought a new shirt today"" ""so what, I buy new shirts all the time"". This use can be abbreviated with just the question ""so?""within context as well.

Perhaps most often I hear it as a genetic way to begin a sentence. ""So I was at the mall the other day and...."" or ""so I would like to begin by saying...."" or ""so tell me about that trip you took to...""

I'm sure there are other uses I'm not considering. Like you mentioned, it's a very colloquial word and thus it is difficult to translate according to strict grammatical adherence. ",0,1403462958,null,0,1403463208,0,cie7dy9,t3_28sor5,t1_cie7dy9,t1_cie4x9b,null,1434354078,3,false,German,t5_2qq51,3

Then a few years later when the Treaty of Rome (which led to the creation of the EEC)  the UK government again decided against taking part. After a few years of strong economic success in the countries which signed the treaty, and economic trouble in the UK, the UK decided that they too wanted in. Only now DeGaulle and France blocked UK membership. After DeGaulle left office the UK was then allowed to join in 1973.

So yes, the UK was denied entry for a few years, but only after twice refusing the opportunity to take part in building the foundations of the EU.

You mean become a compliant backwater within an undemocratic European superstate.

There is no reason for them to change this behaviour, as its worked out pretty well for them so far. Because of the way the EU has acted in the past, I see little reason to trust it.

&gt; Become a protectorate of America and hold some world power. 

You mean, continue to ally ourselves with the US, when and where it suits both us and them.

You mean head into an unknown future as one nation amongst many of comparable size, into a world thats changing at breakneck speed, free to run our own affairs as we see fit, and free from an organisation conceived in the ashes of WWII, which itself could be irrelevant in a few decades.

Let me try to break this down for you one more time. I'll try to use small words. The UK twice decided that they didn't want anything to do with what would become the EU and refused to take part in it's founding. When the UK started seeing that that they were at a disadvantage they suddenly decided that they wanted in. This understandably made people like DeGaulle suspicious of the UK's motives, so not surprisingly the UK had to wait a few years before being accepted. This is a little bit different than your blanket statement that goes no further than to say that the UK was denied. There is much more to the story and you not liking it doesn't make it go away.

This is your quote. I never said anything even close to resembling the the EU is solely responsible for ending all wars. What I did say was that the reason for the creation of the EU was to prevent future wars. Now I know from your last few comments that understanding these types of distinctions are difficult, so again I will try to explain the difference: When something is solely responsible for an event (or non-event) it means that there is no other reason for what happened. When something is created to facilitate an event (or non-event) it in no way means that it is the only reason that the event happened; it simply means that it was created to help make it happen.

http://wikitravel.org/en/Middle_Rhine_Valley

If you want to travel by car, driving on the ""autobahn"" like a lot of visitors 
from foreign countries, you should inform yourself about our traffic rules. 
The autobahn is a dangerous place if you dont know the rules and there are speed 
limits on parts of the autobahn. I recommend this website:

http://www.gettingaroundgermany.info/index.shtml


Another advise, if you are in a big city you should  use public transportation
instead of a car, traveling in big cities of germany is much more relaxed with
public transportation. Public transportation in germanys cities is really good.

At some point it doesn't really pay off anymore to try to incorporate dissenting opinions if they just crop up over so many things (and over things so petty as ""pls no blue and yellow at WWI commemorations""). If the UK seem to throw a tantrum over too many things, at some point a body as large as the EU has to abandon unanimity and move over to some form of (qualified) majority vote. 

Yes, it's unfair to not include the interests of minorities, but it feels also *very* unfair if a minority wields consensus based ""veto power"" too frequently. At some point there will need to be a talk, or the majority will have to move on (which of course risks breaking the relationship permanently).

Lets add something more to the Greek success: 

Athens Airport seeks to hire 70 new staff members aged 19-29 years old for the period of six months. The pay will be the transportation cost of the tickets between their homes and the Airport.

&gt; Don't let the screen door hit you in the #$%$ If you enjoyed the situation in Poland from 1939 to 1989 feel free to swing back to the Russians. They know how to take good care of you. :- )


""Oh no, people talking bad about the U.S. behind our back""--so what else is new?

Frankly that guy is right--not just for Poland, but all countries in general. They should be handling their own security, intelligence, and defense without U.S. financial assistance. Every country has to learn to look out for it's own turf. The U.S. as it is has too many obligations, financial, and otherwise to be able to lend a hand to every country, and as this guy alluded to, it really does nothing for the host country because it gives them a false sense of security (which they have done nothing to develop).


&gt; The irony is that before the collapse of the Soviet Block, Poles were the staunchest supporters of anything American. Of all the former Soviet Block countries, Poland was the most ""westerly"" oriented and the population never embraced the communist system. They did not expect miracles or handouts from the US - merely the freedom to work and develop their country. 

&gt; The Poles still have some distance distance to go but some economist already consider Poland's changes nearly miraculous - the only country that experienced handsome economic growth (when the American and European economy was burning. Heck, there are even Americans seeking jobs in Poland, not to mention the Irish, British, Italians etc. True, over a million Poles left to look for their luck elsewhere, but nearly a million came back from the around the world.

&gt; Right now, that Poles have seen through a lot of bull*** the US is not as popular. This is not to say Poles don't like the American people. This sentiment is still rather strong. But Poles no longer have an illusion about the alleged ""goodness"" of the White House.


I agree with that comment fully. It was the United States, President Roosevelt, especially, together with United Kingdom (Churchill) together ""sold"" Poland down the River at Yalta to the Soviet dominated Communist slavery. However, it should be brought to the readers' attention that Sikorski is married to Anne Applebaum who is one of the directors and the Council on Foreign Relations. CFR is an American Think-tank institution that wants to bring a One-government United New World Order. Almost every presidential administration since FDR to the present has over 200 advisers from the CFR, Trilateral Commission, Atlantic Council and the Bilderberg group. I am positive that Sikorski wants those kinds of ""ties"" to support. Especially if he is to replace Ashton as the EU's foreign policy chief.


&gt; The Polish Minister is right. We have become a country of bluff and bluster, followed by indifference. We spend more time coddling our adversaries than we do strengthening ties to our friends. Obama bows to Mideast enemies while snubbing the Israelis. He cuts our defenses while chastising the Euros for not doing enough to defend themselves (which is true, but meaningless when he is cutting our defense while saying it).

&gt; We have a buffoon in the White House and another buffoon running the Senate.


Sikorski is right. The failure of US and UK to fulfill their obligations to Ukraine under the Budapest memorandum does more damage to America and its allies than all the things Putin has done so far. It destroys the deterrence a treaty brings and encourages adventurism from others around the globe. By failing this test Obama makes it way harder to resolve conflicts around the world without going to war.


&gt; Poland lately is actually doing something that the rest of NATO should do. And that is invest what it can into its military and readiness. Poland has a long history of being surrounded by countries that would want to see it either destroyed of under their thumb. They know better than anyone that a country can only truly depend on their own strength. Though having outside help isn't a bad thing either.


The poles must be racists; he is only saying that because a black man is the prezididdle.


&gt; I guess time heals all wounds as this generation of Pols cant recall the wonderful way of life under the Germans or the Russians. As far as Europe goes the only nation worth a #@&amp;$ is Great Britain and the rest can enjoy life under the new Soviet Union that Stalin Jr. is putting together. As far as Ukraine is concerned, they are not a member of NATO thus we have no business going into that country with heavy troops and advanced weapons that would put the little blond #$%$ in his place but he knows that and is trying to flex his muscles for the poor folks back home.

true,shozy,IREL,Ireland,"&gt;I reject the prospect of the first one doing it, particularly against a backdrop of an election notable for the rise of eurosceptic parties.

I accept that Junker is less legitimate than a properly elected PotC for the reasons you give but my point is he has as much or more than the ones chosen by the council. And it opens the way for the next election to provide full legitimacy for the next PotC. Really I wish Junker wasn't so shit, I think there'd be much less fuss if he was good.

&gt;Well this could be me in my own UK bubble, but I'd never heard of any of the broadcasters.

The BBC carried at least one of them, but chose to show it on BBC Parliament. As I said they didn't do nothing is all I'm saying and I don't think they chose to be so boring. Some of the topics could have been interesting it's just they seemed to all agree with each other that the stuff people think is bad, is bad and stuff people think is good is good.

&gt;Well, they ticked all the boxes so they can tell the people that they should have been paying closer attention

While I accept they need to do more, there is an element of truth to that. People should be paying closer attention.

&gt; telling this to the heads of national government? Against a backdrop of the rise of eurosceptic parties, it's not a convincing argument that it's the right thing to do.

It's the only method of argumentation they have that will get any attention though. By doing this there's no excuse for the media not taking the candidates seriously at the next election. And as I've said the heads of governments can turn around and say no.

And I think this disagreement in the council is typical of the Cameron brand of moderate ""eurosceptic"" except not really eurosceptic. Ignore the EU until something is about to be agreed and only then try to get it changed and then blame the EU for that not working.

true,M2Ys4U,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;The parliament’s triumph will damage the commission’s authority by making it more subservient to the EU legislature. It will politicise a body supposed to consist of commissioners who, working with their non-partisan civil service, represent the general EU interest rather than their home nations.

The Commission has been politicised for quite a while now. It hasn't been left-right politically balanced for at least 3 or 4 commissions. Let's not forget that Borosso is an EPP man himself.

&gt;The parliament’s power grab should not surprise EU governments, least of all London. Under the banner of democracy, elected assemblies have done this for the past 400 years of European history, nowhere more famously than in 17th-century England.

National political parties and governments have managed to believe their own propaganda that the European Parliament doesn't matter when it came to elections. They've all used the EP elections to bash incumbent parties or governments-in-waiting rather than campaign on the issues.

Of course, this head-in-sand action has helped the Eurosceptic parties, who - at least in the UK and from what I've seen on Reddit and a few other English-language news sources - like to campaign against the EU as it was 5/10/15 years ago, ignoring the powers that the directly elected Parliament has so they can over-state the level of democratic deficit in the Union (even though it hasn't yet been eliminated).",0,1403469470,null,0,false,0,ciea7lb,t3_28td96,t1_ciea7lb,t3_28td96,null,1434355408,26,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,26

It's not the fault of the king; he doesn't get involved in politics; he has been drinking, whoring, hunting and doing tourism full time the last 20 years and 10 years ago the monarchy was very popular. 

The new king doesn't have the powers to take action about any of the problems of our society, and a king can't denounce a government. And if the openly corrupt government wants to use him as a shield he can't avoid it. The coronation has been used by the conservatives and the Catholic church and he can't do anything about that.

It's different with Swiss French and Swiss Italian. There're dialects in Marseille and Sicily too, so whatevs. There's no inferiority complex (even though we get flak for it too), they're just different dialects.

Here's my take:

&gt; A Reuters reporter saw Polish special police units, part of a European Union mission, open fire with rubber bullets

Actually, only the Kosovo police used any rubber bullets. The Italian Carrabinieri shot tear gas.

&gt; The violence broke out when several hundred Albanians, protesting over the Serbs' closure of the bridge for the past three years, began hurling rocks and bottles at Kosovo police.

There where 300 organized protesters, who alarmed the police themselves that infiltrators were planning violent acts. The protest went on peacefully and dispersed, afterwards the 10 masked idiots started throwing grenades. Many spectators surrounded the scene.
Furthermore, The protest was not about the long-term barricade erected by the Serbian paramilitary forces, rather against the Kosovo government which was actively protecting the Serbian paramilitaries a few days ago while they were re-building concrete pylons in the middle of the bridge. These were [heavily armed Serbian paramilitaries](http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sq&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegrafi.com%2Flajme%2Fxhandarmeria-serbe-ne-veri-te-mitrovices-2-46834.html&amp;sandbox=1) with the same insignia as the one's who did the atrocities in Kosovo.

&gt; Serbia does not recognize Kosovo as independent, but agreed to give up de facto control over a small Serb pocket of northern Kosovo last year under a deal brokered by the EU. In exchange, Belgrade won the green light to open talks on joining the EU.

Yeah, non of that is true. Who writes this stuff for reuters? The ""agreement"" isn't even officially an agreement, as it would be illogical for Serbia to accept an agreement with an entity which it itself does not recognize, and a government which it itself classifies as terrorist. Nor have there been any such points in the ""agreement"".

&gt; The Serbs dismantled the roadblock on Wednesday, only to replace it with a ""Park of Peace"" consisting of concrete plant pots and earth.

The Serbs did not dismantle the roadblock, the Kosovo police did after some stupid political stuff happening here (government trying to form after elections, politicians trying to flex ""sovereignity"" muscles).",1,1403477210,null,0,false,0,ciedfbc,t3_28stom,t1_ciedfbc,t3_28stom,null,1434356923,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,zurthen,SCOT,Scotland,"This is widely said by linguists, but the thing is that nobody here in Scotland believes them.

Personally I believe Scots was a language at one time. But it is difficult to say whether it still exists in the modern day. Nobody in Scotland speaks pure Scots and few speak pure English, but rather mix vocabulary, phonetics and grammatical features from both languages in their speech. Some speak more Scots than others (referred to as speaking broadly) who use almost pure English. Scottish people also use Scots and English vocabulary interchangably depending on the social context as well, even changing their accents. 

You can see why it's difficult to separate Scots from English and call it a different language. There is no distinction for Scottish people. Yet, both languages are quite different and unintelligible when at their extremes.

I should also note that the Scots language faces widespread prejudice also. Speaking proper English is associated with being an educated person and Scots is associated with the ""lower"" classes of society. It's use for formal or written purposes (except for poetry and music) will *never* be accepted in Scotland because this idea is so ingrained, although it was once used in such ways.

Scots will probably die out completely in the coming generations.

&gt; Nordicism, also ""Nordic theory,"" is an ideology of racial supremacy that claims that a Nordic race, within the greater Caucasian race, constituted a master race.[1][2] This ideology was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in some Central and Northern European countries as well as in North America, and it achieved some further degree of mainstream acceptance throughout Germany via Nazism.

And likewise they are proud to be Tottenham fans or plumbers or owners of a Komondo dog or being religious, but that doesn't mean we need to make those identities the limit of political organization.

&gt;If we followed your logic through, why not have a world government?

We obviously need a method of non-violent conflict resolution on a planetary scale, and to that end we'll use, including but not limited to, laws, courts and elections. I suppose we could have a government too, but that's of secondary importance.

&gt;Gross over simplification, but good way to throw in a loaded remark like 'sovereign maniacs' (do they even exist?) Would that make you a federalist nut job?

That's how sovereignty maniacs do think of anyone that doesn't go along with them, so probably yes. But in fact I want to realize certain goals, I just don't care whether that results in a political reorganization with less influence for individual states.

&gt;In your opinion maybe. There are obviously differing views about how much power a government should have, especially in the case of the EU government as it effects more than one country.

Of course, but it just implies that a government concentrating power is nothing to be worried about. It's the natural process of things. Since the EU level is rather new, it's normal that its power is growing rather than shrinking. At this point it's channeling about 1-1,5% of European GDP. That really isn't much.

I do think it's strange that people from Britain especially would be opposed to a larger union, since it's after all the *United* Kingdom and Britain itself is a state comprising different nations.

&gt; These were heavily armed Serbian paramilitaries

The article you listed (first of all, it's on telegrafi.com, secondly they list their source as ""informed source of Kosovapress"" - so totally unreliable) doesn't say they're ""paramilitaries"". They're Serbian Gendarmerie, which is Serbian Special Police. Why were they there? Read on.

&gt; Yeah, non of that is true. Who writes this stuff for reuters? The ""agreement"" isn't even officially an agreement, as it would be illogical for Serbia to accept an agreement with an entity which it itself does not recognize, and a government which it itself classifies as terrorist. Nor have there been any such points in the ""agreement"".

It most certainly is an agreement. It was signed by the prime minister of Serbia, ratified by the Parliament of Serbia. The whole point of the agreement was the fact that Serbia has now treated it as if it was signing it with an independent country - that's why we were given the green light. It wasn't in the end signed as an ""international"" agreement, but has the same capacity. As for the contents of the agreement, you can talk to Thaci and Ashton about that.

&gt; The Serbs did not dismantle the roadblock, the Kosovo police did after some stupid political stuff happening here (government trying to form after elections, politicians trying to flex ""sovereignity"" muscles).

Yes they did. It was the caterpillars from the cities of Kruševac and Paraćin  that were sent there to demolish the barricades. The Gendarmerie was sent there to protect the SERBIAN caterpillars from the SERBS there. You may not know this, but lots of Serbs in Serbia don't really like Kosovo Serbs (and there are those who love them). You'll often hear in a casual conversation things like ""fuck him, he's a Kosovar"" meaning he's a Serb from Kosovo.

There were interviewing Serbs from Kosovska Mitrovica (northern part of course) who were complaining that the barricades were being removed and were astounded to find that all the machinery had Serbian license plates on them.

After this so-called ""park"" was installed, I can tell you this: the prime minister of Serbia is furious right now and he has scheduled and emergency meeting with the heads of the kosovar Serbs. The outcome of that meeting is already known to everyone.

I also tend to trust Reuters more than telegrafi. 

In any case, this whole thing is a huge bullshit. I remember when all the neighbors around us were Albanian and we got along great (half of my family is from Istok). No one cared.

Imagine where we would be if all the money put into immigration and intergration was put in supporting the possibility of having children instead.

Birth rates aren't a massive problem like in Japan. We have among the best parental leave systems in the world and we spend a lot of money to raise families.

There isn't any reason for mass immigration. We need experienced, educated workers who are willing to adapt to the Swedish society. What we need may vary between persons, some actually believe we need more cultural diversity, but they are mostly extreme lefties who are unedcuated and know nothing about economics or social science.

&gt; It most certainly is an agreement. It was signed by the prime minister of Serbia, ratified by the Parliament of Serbia.

It wasn't ratified by the Kosovo parliament because Thaci played his ridiculous games, hence it never became an agreement between two countries but rather between serbia and Thaci personally (It doesn't even say ""Prime minister"" on the published documents. The talks were sanctioned, but never ratified. Furthermore the documents don't mention the republic of Kosovo anywhere (look it up online, you won't see the republic of Kosovo mentioned as a country anywhere, only as Kosovo* with an ""*"", pointing to Kosovo as a ""region""). Oh and don't forget that the only ""concession"" made by Serbia in these talks was struck down recently by the Serbian constitutional court, due to Serbia's constitution explicitly saying that Kosovo is part of Serbia.

&gt; Yes they did. It was the caterpillars from the cities of Kruševac and Paraćin that were sent there to demolish the barricades. The Gendarmerie was sent there to protect the SERBIAN caterpillars from the SERBS there. You may not know this, but lots of Serbs in Serbia don't really like Kosovo Serbs (and there are those who love them). You'll often hear in a casual conversation things like ""fuck him, he's a Kosovar"" meaning he's a Serb from Kosovo.

You might be talking about the barricades from last winter further in the north. This did not happen this week in Mitrovica.

I was there. It was the Kosovo Military forces heavy equipment. The KFOR forces were there together with the Mitrovica Major, everything was broadcasted live on TV to score political points for everyone.

The EU doesn't even recognize Kosovo. The EU wasn't even an official third party between Kosovo and Serbia because to do so would mean for the EU institutions to recognize Kosovo, which 5 countries never will. The European Commission sent Ashton as a liaison, without any official or legally binding position. This is what the Kosovo position has been complaining about.
Therefore, there is not a single official public document treating this ""agreement"" as an agreement. The only thing Serbia had to do to get further in the EU talks was just to make this make-believe talk with Kosovo, that's it. Nothing has come out of it except further degradation of the political situation within Kosovo.

&gt;  you have to complain to Thaci himself

As did the Kosovo people in these elections. He most likely won't be in government this time around. Hi's mafia bosses are already killing one another.

&gt; No I am not. The KFOR forces were there, for sure, as was the KPS, but the mechanization came from Serbia. Both mayors were there as well.
Hell, the WHOLE REASON our prime minister went to Berlin the other day was so that we can arrange on how those barricades will be removed. That's also one of the reasons behind why Tony Blair came to Belgrade, as well as why Jose Manuel Barroso is coming this week.

Interesting. On the other side of the bridge no heavy machinery was there?... The Unofficial Mayor of North Mitrovica didn't want to be seen on camera. Might the machinery have been brought there as a show? Or has it been blocked by Serbian extremists, never to get to the location? (All serious questions).
I'm asking because there most definitely was no machinery on the other side of the bridge at any point.

&gt; You may not know this, but no. The nut jobs are paid by certain parties in Serbia, I can give you that, but those parties are not in the Serbian Parliament anymore (talking about DSS/SRS here). Official politicians of from North Kosovo are paid from the budget of the Republic of Serbia - this is true. But this is also good because it means they must bow to our will.

Interesting. What does ""Official politicians from North Kosovo"" mean? Non of the locally elected Kosovo backed mayors or municipal structures are paid by Serbia at the moment. The ""unofficial"" Serbian politicians, meaning the one's Belgrade politicians talk to in cases such as these, are the one's doing the crazy stuff.

On that basis you could put together a far better argument that NATO has been the guarantor of peace. You could even go as far as to say that the cold war formed the basis of it.

Now of course the ECSC, EEC and now EU have grown up into something that has provided economic stability along side that, but much of the political  aspect is fairly recent. Sure, you could claim that the project as a whole may have provided some stability in Europe and that promoted peace, but again, I think the economic impact is the important element there, when coupled with NATO and the threats faced during the cold war you have a fairly decent recipe for peace.

What I find vaguely interesting now is the instability being dropped into the mix by eastward expansion and attempts at political union. If the economic foundation that the EU is built on has helped to ensured peace, then isn't there a risk at pushing too hard and breaking that in the attempt at further political union, expansion and the bizarre attempts to push for Europe to be not only an economic and political bloc, but also one that with military and foreign policy objectives.

true,Deusdies,EART,Earth,"As for your first paragraph: you said nearly the same thing already. I understand what you're saying, but you're forgetting one thing: Serbia - or the EU for that matter - don't care. The fact that you don't recognize the agreement is not our problem at all. We were asked to sign it; we did just that. Again, if your documents don't say it's an ""official agreement"", then that's your problem - not ours. On our side, we're treating it as an agreement, which we signed with the then-prime minister of Kosovo.

&gt; The Unofficial Mayor of North Mitrovica didn't want to be seen on camera.

Where did you get that? I just watched him on AlJazeera. 

&gt; Might the machinery have been brought there as a show? Or has it been blocked by Serbian extremists, never to get to the location? (All serious questions). I'm asking because there most definitely was no machinery on the other side of the bridge at any point.

I don't think it's the show. The way it went was something like this: prime minister of Serbia (Vučić) traveled to Berlin where he has made arrangements (which is a nice way of saying ""he was ordered"") to remove the barricades. As soon as he comes back to Serbia, he orders the machinery to come from Serbia and remove them. Serbs down there were confused, there were some caught on the TV saying ""why are they doing this, they have Serbian license plates, I don't understand?"". 

I'm not denying that there was the machinery on the Albanian side as well (I don't know). In fact, it's likely that there has been since this was probably well coordinated effort.

&gt; Interesting. What does ""Official politicians from North Kosovo"" mean?

It means ""those who actually pull the strings in Northern Kosovo"". Kosovo may be independent, but there's still a power struggle in the Northern part of Kosovo. Those politicians (such as the Mayor of Kosovska Mitrovica - the Northern part, and others) are paid by Belgrade. 

They do the crazy stuff sometimes (and that usually provokes fury in Serbia), but if they weren't under Belgrade's control, I fear things would be worse. 

As far as payment goes, this is what enrages me (and lots of other people) the most. Like you said, they get double salaries, and they (in my eyes) do nothing but cause trouble and complain all the time. I think there have been some changes in their ""order"" recently as well. I mean, the amount of money Serbia spends on Kosovo is insane - it's estimated to be around 500 million EUR per year. There's even a website - http://kolikokostakosovo.info/ - (translated: how much does kosovo cost?"" that shows the latest numbers, how much was spent since the 1999. 

Thankfully, this agreement we signed is a step in the right direction - at least for us. We're limiting our involvement with Kosovo, and it barely even is in our media today (except when things like this happen).

However, if you want the demonstrative adjectives, like ""this book"" and ""that car"", you should use the definite article ""das/der/die"" and then perhaps add the word ""da"" if you need to stress that it's ""that"" and not ""this"" or just ""the"". However, often the definite article itself seems to work fine.

To my knowledge, ""dies-"" is not outdated as a demonstrative adjective. I hear it often when I listen to speakers.",0,1403495611,null,0,1403559743,0,ciekvzo,t3_28tks5,t1_ciekvzo,t3_28tks5,null,1434360504,3,false,German,t5_2qq51,3

I don't know how it compares to Ireland, but being found with an ounce of weed on you is at the very least going to give the cops a chance to make your life a misery for the next couple of hours. It is illegal to buy, sell or possess most drugs without a prescription, although it's not illegal to consume them (this means if they do a blood test and find you've been smoking weed, they can't do anything unless they actually find some on you). Small amounts of marijuana (about 10g or less) are confiscated but they usually don't prosecute unless they suspect you're actually a dealer or a habitual user. For larger amounts, they analyze it to find out how much THC you were carrying: more than 7.5g and you're looking at a prison sentence of at least one year.

I don't know about nowadays, but Frankfurt's drugs scene always used to be concentrated around the central railway station. Between there and the high-rise towers of the financial quarter is the city's red light district.

Things to do: Well, Frankfurt attracts lots of tourists, although Germans are very dismissive of the city. Most of it is post-war, but there are some historic old bits here and there, most famously the Römer, the central square with the city hall. There's a huge building site around it, though, as they're currently reconstructing a wider area of the historic city. The main shopping street is called ""Zeil"" and runs from Konstablerwache to Hauptwache. Just south of the river is Sachsenhausen (*not* the concentration camp, that's a different Sachsenhausen near Berlin), which is the more student-y pub-and-club district. There should be plenty of little pubs where young hopefuls are struggling to get their musical talents recognised. There should also be some reasonably cheap places to eat.

If you have a few euros for a train ticket, you could take a local train to Rüdesheim. Rüdesheim itself is actually a tourist hell-hole, but rising above the town is a hill with the Niederwald Monument on top. There's a cable car to the top if you don't feel like walking. The Niederwald Monument is a big showy-off statue representing Germania, basically giving two fingers to the French. It has some pretty amazing views. In the middle of the river you can see the Mouse Tower of Bingen where, according to legend, the evil Archbishop Hatto of Mainz was eaten alive by mice.",0,1403502099,null,0,false,0,cien25h,t3_28uijz,t1_cien25h,t3_28uijz,null,1434361592,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

I hear that argument a lot, but that is bullshit. You don't get hired to be a technician in US intelligence unless you take an oath not to reveal top secret information.

You only swore an oath to protect the constitution, so whatever you want to do is fine."" He wasn't a constitutional lawyers, he was an NSA technician whose duty it was to keep the information from US enemies hidden. Maybe you could say he  was right to reveal mass surveillance, even revealing the tapping Merkel's phone, but there is no way for him to justify revealing operations against the Chinese. No matter how you figure it, in cyberwar, China has proven beyond a doubt that it is an enemy of  the US constitution (see trying to intimidate an American citizen because he filed a law suit by sabotaging his business and hacking his employees devices.)",0,1403506640,null,0,1403506962,0,cieo89e,t3_28s8oz,t1_cieo89e,t1_cienkee,null,1434362145,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,Brandmon,MALT,Malta Pajjiz tal-Miki Maws,"One has to keep in mind the Russian definition of ""Fascism"". 

While in Western and Central Europe it is more accurately defined by the form of government it takes up, that of an ethnic-authoritarian state capitalist society, in Russia the term Fascism doesn't relate to that at all. 

Linguistically it would actually not be far off to equate what they refer to fascism as meaning what in English one could call ""the Enemy"". That which opposes *us* or wishes to do *us* harm. Hence why in the Cold War some within the USSR viewed NATO as ""Fascist"" and were not too shy about expressing such a view. ""Fascism"" in the Russian vocabulary was no longer defining a set ideology. It merely refereed to those who opposed the Soviet Union/Russia and wished to do harm to its people.

I guess a similar example would be how ""Terrorist"" is used within American circles, most notably within the right wing media, to refer to ""the Enemy"" post 9/11. I guess we are all too familiar how ""Terrorist"" is in such cases no longer used to define a set course of action. It is instead used to refer to those who opposed the US and wished to do harm to Americans. 

Hence Neo-Nazis in Russia don't need to worry about being persecuted for their ideology, but for the perception of being ""Anti-Russia"" which, as it turns out, isn't hard to do in Russia if you happen to be such a Russian Nationalist. Indeed the occurrence of the [German imperial flag being waves by German neo-nazis](http://www.algemeiner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Neonazi_2.4.2005_Mu%CC%88nchen.jpg) and the [Russian imperial flag being flown by similarly minded people](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/75731000/jpg/_75731163_022638804-1.jpg) isn't a coincidence: different package, same bullshit. 

The word ""Fascism"" or ""Nazism""  is used to drum up antagonisms and to serve the purpose of a world view that sees itself surrounded by enemies; a world view often mocked from our point of view as being ""Paranoid of *Neo-Nazi Homosexual NATO Imperialists*"".

true,my_baby_ate_dingos,afriquedusud,Afrique du Sud,"A few thoughts on this. I'm always a bit ticked off by Americans trying to chide France for anti-Semitism like it never happens in their country - I mean, yeah, sure, anti-Semitism exists here, no contest. But if you look at /r/conspiracy, the nutcases complaining about a shadow Jewish government controlling the world aren't French...

But you have to learn to accept valid criticism, and that article has some good points.

&gt; convergence of four main factors. (...) Scapegoating amid hard economic times, the growing strength of far-right nationalists, a deteriorating relationship between black Europeans and Jews, and, importantly, increasing tensions with Europe’s surging Muslim population.

**Scapegoating**? I honestly don't see that. That means that 2010 anti-Semites are the same as 1930s anti-Semites. I don't believe that's the case, and frankly, I haven't heard anyone implying the economic crisis is  the Jews' fault. **Nationalists** are definitely an issue, but they tend to be careful around anti-Semitism. They have so many shitty opinions already that anti-Semitism is a bit of a touchy spot for them - it doesn't mean they like Jews, but they're careful about their opinions in public. Recently the founder of the National Front was told off by his own party for an anti-Semitic joke, that takes some doing. The **Muslim** issue is probably the bigger one, because French Jews conflate criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism, while French Muslims conflate Israelis with all Jews in the world. The middle-eastern conflict is spilling over basically, nothing really new.

However, I wonder why it happens in France primarily. Radical British Muslims have put together numerous unsuccessful terror attacks in the UK (and a successful one in 2006) but none of those specifically targeted Jews. Both the recent radical French Muslim terrorists (Nemmouche and Merah) targeted Jews - although Merah also targeted the military. What makes it different?

&gt; In Western Europe, no nation has seen the climate for Jews deteriorate more than France.

That's the truth though. 

&gt; A recent global survey by the New York-based Anti-Defamation League suggested that France now has the highest percentage in Western Europe — 37 percent — of people openly harboring anti-Semitic views. That compares with 8 percent in Britain, 20 percent in Italy and 27 percent in Germany.

How does that happen? Does the Israel-Palestine conflict explain that? French public opinion has always been MASSIVELY on the side of Palestine (an exception in the West) whether or not French Muslims are involved. Is that an explanation, a slippery slope that took French public opinion from anti-Zionism to anti-Semitism?

I honestly don't know. Half my family is Jewish, and I don't feel afraid for them, most of the time. Although recently one of my cousins decided it was time to pack up and leave, and he's preparing to move his family to Israel. I figured it was a religious move for him, but what if it's a safety issue?

true,yannickmahe,FRAN,France,"The treaties state that the President of the EU commission is appointed by the European Council (the council of all the European Head of states/government), and accepted or rejected by the EU parliament. This year, the parliament made a bold move and decided to make this parliamentary election more similar to national elections: the basically said that the leader of the winning party should be the head of the Commission, like in Germany or the UK. By doing this they hope to reduce the ""democratic deficit"": the head of the EU Commission instead of being appointed by the EU Council (the less democratic institution), it would be elected by the people as the leader of the winning party. This is a BIG deal: it makes the EU more democratic, and more like a supranational entity. In effect, the head of the government of the EU would be elected instead of appointed ; he/she would have the backing of the EU parliament in many ways which would give hime the political klout to go against the EU Council if needed. As the Commission and the Council are often seen as the less democratic institutions, this would hopefully balance things out more.

Before the election, every European Party (a European Party is an ""alliance"" of various national parties with similar political views) chose a Spitzenkandidat, a candidate for the Presidency of the EU commission. Jean-Claude Juncker was the candidate for the EPP. The EPP (center-right, pro-europe) got the most MEPs (~~275~~ 221 out of 751). Juncker is a very pro-EU politician, was Luxembourg PM for a number of years as well as president of the Euro group.

Since then the discussion has been on whether or not Juncker should be president of the EU Commission. Even though the parliament said they would only accept the winning Spitzenkandidat, some members of the EU Council do not want the president of the Commission to be chosen by the people but rather want to continue the old way of a simple ratification by the parliament. Notably, UK PM David Cameron has been a staunch opponent of Juncker's nomination.

Right now it seems Juncker has the support of European center-right leaders (Merkel, notably) and center-left leaders who are in favor of the increased democracy in the process (Hollande, Renzi). This seems to mean that Juncker will become EU Commission President, but there is a lot of political maneuvering by his opponents to avoid this.",0,1403509991,null,0,1403514209,0,cieoxsj,t3_28td96,t1_cieoxsj,t1_cieofmb,null,1434362478,17,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,17

First, I've lived in Europe. I've traveled to most every continent. I work in fashion, I don't dress like a tourist, carry large bags, wear squishy shoes, and stare stupefied at the pretty buildings. I was two blocks from where I am staying, a good deal before midnight, in a good neighborhood and just trying to get back to my temporary ""home."" I'm from a large city, not Wisconsin (no offense Wisconsiners), so I walk fast and with purpose. I've also taken self defense courses, have a degree in sociology, and am well aware of the triggers for victimization in petty crime. I have so far been addressed in French first by Parisians everywhere I go, and kindly told every day of my stay so far that I don't look or act like an american. So, I take issue with the ""obvious tourist"" comment. Even this jackass and his little gang spoke French to me, and didn't back off until I unloaded on them a string of unsavory banshee English. Frankly, I think I surprised them.  

Second, I think it is decidedly MORE tragic that the attitude is ""oh, it's sad, but it's a fact of life here."" What if I was a dumpy chubby American girl here? Does that make an assault where I have to fight back, HARD, with no assistance from the bystanders, ok?This is the same attitude that condemns women here and abroad (like in Egypt, where I and almost every woman I know has been assaulted) and presumes that their skirts were too short. No. I was two blocks from a police station, and as a woman considering a relocation here, I think it's a bit sad that there wasn't increased police presence and/or volunteers like there are in other major cities visible that evening. I should not have to have an escort to be able to travel a short distance safely before midnight. 

I recognize that you are not saying this behavior is ""ok,"" but I still feel the need to address the comment. It simply feels a bit like a ""blame the victim"" game.

There might be a surge in antisemitic acts from white nationalists and Le Pen's supporters but honestly, most of the hatred towards the Jewish community comes from French nationals of Arabic descent. I won't make generalizations or racial profiling but two of the perpetrators of said antisemitic acts were called Mohammed Merah and Mehdi Nemmouche, so you tell me who hates the Jews.

Les gens commencent à le remarquer et à s'éloigner peu à peu de lui autant que possible. Un de ses amis lui demande si ça va et lui tend un mouchoir. Il hoche de la tête tout en vacillant.

Nothing you have said has actually directly contradicted what he claimed, though?

Your argument seems to be (correct me if I'm wrong) ""spitzenkandidaten held a TV debate and no national leaders cared enough to voice disapproval beforehand, therefore the Parliament's interpretation of the treaties that govern the EU are now the *de facto* legal interpretation"".

Sorry, but that's not how it works.  The Council (or individual member states) can disagree at any time if they feel their sovereignty is being infringed.  There is no time limit, or statute of limitations if you will, for disagreeing with such a large transfer of power away from the national governments and to the European Parliament.

Lastly, how many members of the Council actually came out and directly endorsed the idea of spitzenkandidaten?

Yes is did. u/cbfw86 said:

No wait. It's not being done in accordance with law. The EP is making this up as it goes along.


That is not true because the EP interpreting the vague text in the treaty is not illegal. I basically said that when I wrote:

 &gt;The european parliament might have interpreted the Lisbon-treaty in its favor, sure.

 And they aren't acutally making it up as they go because this is the first election to the EP under the Lisbon-treaty. Interpreting a clause with no precedence to it a certain way is not ""making it up as you go"". 


To your claim that the Council can disagree when they feel their sovereignty is being infringed. 

Sure, they *can*, but you seem to forget that were dealing with politicians doing politics. The politcal statute of limitions was reached when election time came around. If they were so against it, they shouldn't have let it go all the way to televised debates and the front runners being adamant that only one of them can be Comission President.

Ah, OK.  On this I agree.  The Parliament has an interpretation, as do some national leaders, and those interpretations differ.

Says who?  You've adopted a fairly contentious interpretation of how this matter should proceed and are now trying to pass it off as a Gospel truth that we all should accept.

Merkel and the handful of national leaders that endorsed the idea of the spitzenkandidaten do not speak for the rest of the Council.  Cameron is, in my view, absolutely right to push this, and bring the matter to a head.  If he can build a strong enough consensus with other national leaders to block the appointment of Juncker, then fine.  If he can't, then fine.

&gt; This whole ordeal is especially strange in Britain. The main critiscism of the EU is it' so called democratic deficit. Okay, but what is more democratic than electing the head of the appointed executive branch?

Why do people keep claiming this?  The supposed ""democratic deficit"" is not sufficient excuse to simply leave the national governments at the wayside in a power grab by the European Parliament that was not explicitly agreed by the national governments beforehand.

The democratic deficit is a cause for concern, yes.  But the correct solution to that is to change the treaties governing the functioning of the European Parliament (or to bring the matter to a head, as Cameron is doing, and have a decent debate on the power of the Parliament, so countries that agree with the derived consensus can continue, and those that don't can decide to drop out of the organisation) and to stop writing completely ambiguous treaties in the first place.",0,1403515236,null,0,1403515642,0,ciepuva,t3_28td96,t1_ciepuva,t1_ciepshr,null,1434362911,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

You're just going to lock in the past that way, allowing no flexibility to evolve.

- J'ai été pris à Google Zürich. 

- Je suis en train de finir un master d'info théorique à l'École Normale Supérieure. 

- Je pense que je vais beaucoup programmer, oui (beaucoup plus que lors des stages académiques que j'ai fait avant \^\^). Je m'attends à des journées de travail longues, mais organisées comme je le souhaite (les horaires sont libres, on peut faire la sieste au bureau…). Lors du processus de recrutement, ils m'ont dit qu'il fallait maîtriser au moins un langage parmi C++ et Java (et comme je ne connais pas bien C++, je pense que je vais faire du Java), et que c'était un gros plus d'en connaître un autre parmi C++, Java et Python (c'est mon cas, je sais coder en Python).

- J'ai été recommandé par quelqu'un qui bossait déjà là-bas. Par rapport à une candidature à l'aveugle sur Internet, ça garantit à peu près d'avoir un entretien téléphonique. Le processus est incroyablement long et compliqué. J'ai eu 11 entretiens en tout : 1 en visio pour me poser des questions générales et m'expliquer ce qui m'attend, puis 2 en visio techniques, puis une journée de 5 entretiens techniques sur place (ils paient le voyage et l'hébergement), puis mon dossier a pas été accepté mais mon recruteur a « fait appel », donc j'ai passé un entretien de motivation supplémentaire pour que quelqu'un d'autre appuie mon dossier, puis 2 entretiens techniques en plus sur place pour dissiper les doutes du comité de recrutement sur ma capacité à programmer en Java :-)

Les tests techniques ne sont pas trop durs au niveau du contenu (c'est de l'algorithmique pas trop compliquée, faire des concours de programmation type Google Code Jam ou TopCoder aide *beaucoup*), mais la forme est inhabituelle est donc peut facilement déconcentrer : coder sur un Google Documents en étant en même temps en visio avec quelqu'un, ou bien coder sur un tableau blanc, c'est pas facile \^\^. Et avoir 5 entretiens dans la même, c'est une vraie épreuve, physiquement.

There is the first problem... how do you determine national interests? In liberal democratic theory, national interest is the aggregation of individual interests. What kind of system would align the interest of the majority with the interests of a single individual, while ensuring that the minority does not get thrown under the bus?

This sounds even more utopian to me than communism or syndicalist anarchism. 

&gt;The only way for a country to be misruled in that case is if the ruler is genuinely incapable of doing what he wants to do, in which case he's unfit to rule in any kind of government anyway
