Lower-income Americans would find moving to Europe very attractive, because they wouldn't have to deal with issues like healthcare and education. This would put an additional strain on EU taxpayers, and possibly damage their welfare systems. A few higher-income Americans would move, yes, but there's no denying that there'd definitely be a lot of poor people saving up for a flight to Germany or wherever. This would also mean labour costs in the US may rise significantly, increasing costs of facilities you take for granted, like public transport, forcing the government to institute some welfare policies to retain labour, thus increasing tax - something which Americans seem rather opposed to.

The largest class of Europeans I can see migrating to the US are computer scientists, and maybe doctors, because the pay can be orders of magnitude higher, and at the end of the day, the average human would go to the highest bidder. Unfortunately, people tend to romanticize how easy it to find jobs in CS, and the Bay Area could possibly become more and more cramped with unemployed people looking for 'the best' work, sort of like a more educated LA.

Of course, as you said, the elephant in the room is healthcare, and possibly education too. Again, I know it's *possible* for Americans to get very cheap  education if they look in the right places, but not everybody's motivated enough to do so.

I'm not certain whether more funding beyond that would be necessary, but most reports I've seen suggest that it wouldn't be.

As for disincentive to work, I've never seen any evidence that people generally want to be idle, and most proposals for basic income don't provide enough money for people to have active leisure time without having a job to pay for it. The income itself wouldn't be a disincentive to work because earning supplementary income wouldn't make you lose the assistance (contrary to many existing social assistance programs); instead, after a certain threshold, the basic income would start to decrease at a lower rate than your supplementary income is increasing, until it zeroes out, at which point you start contributing to the program.",0,1411238888,null,0,false,0,cknrmsq,t3_2gvq7d,t1_cknrmsq,t1_cknqeaf,null,1426905614,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt; As for disincentive to work

To clarify, I didn't said that BI would *create* disincentives to work, only that I'm not convinced it would *remove* them. But now I changed my mind a bit. It depends on the amount of basic income, the smaller the amount if BI, the more incentives to work. So if the BI is e.g. $1 a month, you would have more incentives to work than today.

The interesting question is, if you keep the magnitude of income redistribution the same as today (let's define that as ""unemployed get the same amount of money as today""), will the unemployed have more incentives to work, meaning, will they have a higher income jump if they get a job?

Obviously what I meant by that is that they're worse than any European country in not listening to others.

&gt;I pointed out how Sweden completely disregarded their agreements with the EU in a very glaring way.

Source please. Seems very odd since there are multiple countries who aren't in the Eurozone but are in the EU.

2003 we voted in Sweden wether to join the Eurozone or not but the majority voted no.

&gt; And NO ONE listens to the UN. It is a useless organization for many things. The EU is far more powerful than the UN.

No, only major countries ignore them. The US wouldn't even be in the UN if they weren't given a veto. That says something about USA doesn't it? 

&gt;And yes I am totally imagining things when you phrase comments using typical ignorant American.

You enforce a negative stereotype of Americans. Every American isn't like you. Many Americans on Reddit however are like you.

I think the primary problem in the US is actually party politics. We only have two main parties that have a monopoly on all dialogue (or lack thereof) in politics. And people would rather focus more on not letting ""the other guy"" win than sit down and examine what the actually issues are right now, such as civil liberties and healthcare.

Healthcare is *huge* right now. As you mentioned, a lot of people see programs like Obamacare as an affront on liberty -- which is a disingenuous representation of what most people are actually like and what people actually value, such as charity. These certain individuals have no problem with charity and are quite giving and generally kind people but don't see the value in a nationalized healthcare system.

The good news is that those sentiments are more popular with older individuals, who grew up in a time when ""pulling yourself up by your bootstraps"" was not only lauded -- it was still possible.

But with the younger generations, including my own (I'm in my early twenties), there is an evident shift in ideology. Corporations have had too much freedom thanks to the laissez-faire policies you mentioned. Education is abysmal, thanks to inane party politics. There are still a lot of places where being gay will lose you a job, or will lose you the right to marry your significant other. Tuition and textbooks are artificially inflated through the roof, with little hope of getting a job after college to pay for all your debt. Our military puts its nose where it doesn't belong. And the number one reason for bankruptcy in the US is due to medical debt, because hospitals quite literally invent their own prices, and privatized health insurance does absolutely squat in the overall scheme of things.

More and more people, it would seem, are fed up with these things... healthcare chief among them. However, it has a couple of reasons why the general public is *currently* against it:

1\. As mentioned above, some people just don't see the value in a nationalized healthcare system, or seem to understand how it actually benefits society as a whole, including themselves

2\. Because you have to pay out of pocket for the healthcare, and many people are struggling right now - so the mandatory fees are very unpopular

3\. If you didn't charge outright, you would have to raise taxes (this would be the ideal scenario), which is never a popular option.

Anyway, I'm ranting, but where I'm going with it is this: we may not be quite there yet, and that is a damn shame, but we're heading in that direction. I won't be here to see it, but in 10-20 years my generation will be fed up with this system and will likely have more of a say than the currently 60 year old NRA members sitting in their apocalypse bunkers while spitting their chewing tobacco on Obama's HOPE posters.",0,1411240770,null,0,false,0,cknsfni,t3_2gy01z,t1_cknsfni,t1_cknq5yr,null,1426905240,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,4ringcircus,UNSA,United States of America,"Russia and USA absolutely did not rise at a similar level. 2008 had a worldwide economic crisis. That isn't a knock on Europe. Europe is still way stronger of an economy that Russia could ever dream of being. I repeat, Russia is not a rival of USA in any meaningful way. They are irrelevant. Japan is much more relevant than Russia could ever dream of.

I mean, just how in the world is Russia relevant? They are as relevant as any other gas station country with a dictatorship government.

In case you didn't know, GDP and living standards are the biggest factors in ""relevance"" for countries outside of periods of war. Even then GDP determines output for war production. Russia can't support itself without EU giving them money. Russia would literally collapse and go bankrupt. Russia also needs huge growth in GDP to just break even or compare to EU or USA who are economic giants on the world stage. Russia is getting crushed right now economically and hovering around zero is failure for the Russian state.

Russia a rival for USA on relations with China? Compare China's trade with USA and Russia and say that again with a straight face. China just bent Russia over a barrel over their fuel deal. Russia has no one to turn to and China took advantage of it. Good for them. Russian government depends entirely on their fuel network delivering fuel to EU and over half of the government revenue depends on this money.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I agree that there are huge levels of dissatisfaction with the political class in America at the moment, and virtually everywhere else in the Western World, but I don't think this will necessarily or even likely lead to America being pushed towards a European model. Dissatisfaction is a sign that change is potentially coming, but it offers little indication of what direction that change will be in. For instance, in most of Western Europe that dissatisfaction is being harnessed by charismatic populists like Nigel Farage and Marine le Pen, simply because they are anti-establishment.

You've given some good reasons why Americans generally oppose socialised healthcare programmes, but the thing is, those quibbles are felt also by Europeans both now, and when we were creating our welfare schemes, but it was felt to be a categorical imperative that we undertake these schemes because they were the right thing to do and it was realised that we had the means to do it. [In the UK, the welfare state was constructed immediately after the war, because it was felt that if we could flatten East Anglia in order to build air strips to fight the Nazis, why couldn't we undertake equally ambitious projects to fight poverty and inequality? However, in continental Europe, these projects were usually built over time.] In the US, it is quite apparent that you have the means to do it, given spending on foreign wars under the ruse of 'securing American interests'. Why is helping the poor not seen as a better way of serving American interests? In European countries, that is exactly how it is seen, which is why we spend more on healthcare as a proportion of GDP than on defence (to which the US government continually berates us for, not that we care/listen).  

So there's definitely reasons why the US is generally against socialised healthcare, but if the US had the same mind set as Europeans, or to an extent Canadians, then those reasons would seem insignificant.

Europe has its fair share of flats, row houses, big box stores, car dealerships, etc. Obviously this is common sense, and I knew they existed, but I didn't really associate them with Europe until I visited. 

The biggest shock to me overall was Iraqi Kurdistan. I almost didn't go. I was having fun in Istanbul, and I am sure I would have had a great time if I stayed there. But I already had my flight booked to Diyarbakir, so I took it. It was the most eye opening adventure of my life. So different than what you think of when you think of ""Iraq"". I was treated better there than any other place I've visited. The food was great. I learned more about human struggle in 2 weeks than I have in the rest of my life. A Kurd was telling me about how much of his family was lost under Saddam's anti-Kurdish campaigns. He was born while his mom was handcuffed to a pipe in a Ba'ath prison. Her only medical treatment came from other prisoners. That was only part of the story. When he was done I told him he really needed to write a book before all those stories are lost. He replied, ""nobody would read it. Everyone here has a similar story."" That is really what made it sink in how much suffering occurred there.

Unfortunately, that's very true. I don't consider myself a part of either party -- but for the time being, for progress' sake, I tend to lean towards the candidates that are for the most liberal policies (healthcare reform, marriage equality etc), which tend to be Democrats anyway. 

We tend to vote for whomever seems to be the less shit option, which, if I'm not mistaken, is similar to how it's done in Britain. :P

I've done some research and it seems that, limited though I am here, I would have more opportunities here in the US than in, say, Rome, Naples, or Sicily -- where my family is from.

(LV here, sry no flair)
See, that kind of highlights the issue we have with being called 'eastern europeans'.  From where we stand, we would never call Russians 'cold', exact opposite - we consider them 'people with wide open souls', heart on a sleeve, quick to emotions(=hot), unlike ourselves. We really read 'cold' more as a personal space thing and we traditionally need a lot of it - very non-eastern trait, not sure how Nordic though.

Now as for 'not smiling'... Yeah, I know that's an Eastern European archetype, but I have travelled quite a bit and in my experience that archetype is really more of a nothern trait, not eastern. I have not been to Denmark (and I would not be surprised if Danes are more like Germans in this), but in Sweden, Norway, Finland people don't really smile all that much, be it in public services, shops, cafés or just walking down the street. As opposed to Czechs, Bulgars or Romanians who smile way more.

Of course, that is just one of the aspects. Tolerance is where we have severe dissociative disorder as a society - we want to be tolerant and we are very ashamed when we aren't... But honestly, we really are not.  Funny enough, corruption gets similar treatment - your average Latvian Joe Schmoe will feel very inconvenienced and embarrassed when bribing doctor for better treatment, skipping VAT in car service or at the dentist, receiving salary in cash 'under the table'... But despite embarrassment he still is involved in all the above (and will think himself better than 'Eastern Europeans ' who are quite brash about their skirting of the law).

*Blockheads* only refers to Albanians, not all eastern Europeans and most Swiss people don't even know that insult. 

The prejudice of Albanians having square skulls (thus the term blockhead) came from Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian refugees who immigrated to Switzerland during the Yugoslav Wars. When they came here many still hadn't realised that there wasn't a good and a bad side in the wars and still held a grudge against their ""enemy"" from the war. E.g. lots of Serbians still hated Albanians because of what happend in the past of both countires and because of what was still happening during the time they fled. Even as immigrants in Switzerland many of them continued to hate and curse at each other instead of forgiving. *Blockhead* was the Serbs/Bosnians/Croats most favorite curse against Albanians.

I hope this doesn't sound like all immigrants from ex-yugoslavia are like that. That behaviour is/was luckily not too common, and actually was almost more common within the second generation which came to Switzerland either as a very young child or was born here.

If you search in them the topic(s) you're studying, you can find relevant vocabulary that probably isn't in the textbooks. Don't aim to try and understand all of it or look up every word!

* Online dictionaries! [Dict.cc](http://www.dict.cc/) was my fave, but there are lots of others. Has a chrome extension, which is useful when reading articles.

* To learn vocabulary, I found spaced repetition software was really helpful. It's basically flashcards, but computerised and scheduled for maximum efficiency. I used [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) to input my own words as I went along (~10 a day), and it improved my comprehension levels a lot.

* I didn't watch that much film/TV, but [ZDF](http://www.zdf.de/ZDFmediathek#/hauptnavigation/startseite) has some OK programmes. A lot of English shows and films are dubbed in to German, so it might be worth trying to find your favourite film in German to watch.

It's the rule everywhere, from what I hear, but at least my turds are more shiny than some other places' turds ;)

I've actually got a similar plan to you in place, as regarding citizenship. If the UK ever leaves the European Union (which I hope dearly that it doesn't and am even willing to campaign on the issue) then I am going to apply for German citizenship based on being a descendant of those who lost their citizenship at the hands of the National Socialists. Under German law, if you had your citizenship struck off by them or are a descendant of someone who was, then you're eligible to get it back. 

If that were ever to happen, I don't think I could stay in the UK. I've been learning French and German for the past few years for a whole variety of reasons (chief among them, being that I like learning/am a glossophile) which would put me in a good place to move there if I ever wanted to. And to be fair, I think I might move there anyway. I don't want to spend my whole life in one country, ever never really experienced what it's like to live and work abroad.

true,Lazin,DENK,Denmark,"Is were in Syria for 3 weeks in the summer of 2010, mainly in Damascus, but a few days spent in Latakia (major coastal city) as well.

I'm from Copenhagen and kinda expected to see more people in traditional clothing, more women in scarfs, but honestly I see as many scarfs wearing women in some areas of Copenhagen than I did in most of Damascus. It was way more modern than I expected. There were few women in scarfs, niqab burca or what have you, but of course some, and some men in more traditional clothing, like [this](http://shukr.co.uk/blog//wp-content/uploads/2009/01/image-5.jpg) or [this](http://cdn-wac.emirates247.com/polopoly_fs/1.204263.1271845271!/image/3562454402.jpg). Most were in rather western clothing though.

I have been to Tangier (Morroco) once, and that city lives and dies on tourism (at least it felt that way) so you couldn't walk anywhere without feeling like everyone was eyeing you for a sale. In Damascus however, the tourism from Europe must be rather low, because you were never rushed by salesmen because you were white, people seemed interested in who you were more out of curiosity than to make a sale. It was very friendly and quiet compared to more tourist heavy areas. I'm not saying I expected hostility, but I kinda expected more people approaching me and trying to sell stuff all the time in a rather aggressive way,which I'd experienced in especially Tangier, but to some degree in basically every major city with a lot of tourists. 

Latkia had a rumour for being even more western, and it was. It and people looked more like it was a coastal city in Southern Europe than what my prejudice told me I should expect from Syria. The beaches were kinda bad, and some people bathed wearing a lot of cloths, but some looked no different from other beaches around Europe.

Overall it seemed more modern and western that I had expected, we seemed much more alike than what I would've expected. It was a really good vacation and I got to experience a lot I never would have either, talking with a Saudi Arabian fighter pilot on leave while in an Arabian bath, see churches from before Islam was a thing, museums about the Syrian-Israeli conflict from their POV, fantastic mosques and the Syro-Arabian Desert. I'd recommend anyone to visit if it wasn't for the absolutely devastating conflict destroying the country right now.

Harsh weather increases the prevalence of diseases such as pneumonia and hypothermia, which have mainly been from the minimal amount of sunlight in the winter time. In turn, this notion is indicative of the winter season having a general association with suicide rates.

I was a teenager during the Bush years in a state that was only mildly conservative.

As I've been following the more recent conflict with Ukraine/Russia/NATO I've wondered if Russia was going though the same thing: feeling like the world is against Russia, media in lockstep with the government, people shouting down dissent, etc. 

There is also a potential comparison between motives for war - with the US, there was an idealistic clique who genuinely wanted Sadaam removed from power whatever the costs (in addition to the financial reasons)  while in the Russian government, there's an idealistic clique who wants to bring back the USSR.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;What methods do you use to study them?

over the past three years, more than I can remember. 

The main structure I tend to go with (and there's a clear pattern emerging, given that I am now starting Spanish) is to start with the Michelle Thomas CDs, which you don't have to buy and can just borrow from the local library, if you're not into piracy. Then I do *a lot* on memrise.com and continue doing a lot on memrise.com forever. I try and go on there every day for both French and German. Great for vocabulary grinding. If you want to actually have a decent sized vocabulary (minimum 20,000 words, but more likely 50,000 or 60,000 if you want to be really able to articulate yourself on politics and other things) within a few years, you're going to need to learn at least a few words everyday (on average). I will definitely try and go to regular evening classes as well, even if they are infrequent. If you get beyond the basics, it's very important to actually have someone on top who can explain things in a *succinct and comprehensible manner*. But I also try and find pen/skype pals as well, just for chit-chatting. I've become really good friends with a German/Austrian over the past couple of years, who I actually went to stay with in the Alps for a week just this summer, which was fantastic. 

And that's really it. It sounds like a lot, and it kind of is, especially when you include all of the stuff I haven't mentioned (listening to podcasts [shoutout to Langsame Gesprochene Nachrichten beim DW.DE], [trying to] reading stories and news in the language, occasional attempts at Duolingo.com) but it's spread out over a few years so it doesn't have that much of an effect on your life, and it makes you very proud whenever you actually use your skill or feel like you're making progress, and if you use technology in the right way, you can just use it to fill in gaps of time where you wouldn't have otherwise done anything. 

Have you started learning yet, or is this also informing your plan of what to do in the event that you leave? How much progress have you made in Dutch?",0,1411252033,null,0,false,0,cknx7mp,t3_2gy01z,t1_cknx7mp,t1_cknwe8i,null,1426902941,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Hard to say. I think French is easier (although I think they're both very easy) because of all the shared vocabulary, and the word order is almost identical to English, so the only stuff you need to learn is the other half of the vocabulary, and the tenses. Also, it's a lot easier to speak bad French, in my opinion. For instance, I've only been doing the absolute minimum with my French for the past year (I've only been learning it for a year) because I've had a lot of education work and German work, but I can still kind of muddle through a basic conversation, ask for directions, order food and so on. And there's a lot of knowledge I have at the moment, but can't quite make use of, but would will very easily be able to when I start evening classes again next week (they stopped for the summer). 

German, on the other hand, has a lot more different vocabulary, and you have to get your head around the case system, and the word order. However, if you've learned Dutch to a reasonable standard, then German should be a walk in the park. I mean, as a German speaker I can understand basically 70% of any Dutch that I see written down. And I am by no means a fully competent speaker.

Personally, I just have more of a passion for Germany and German culture. Mostly it's because of the Bretzels. Can't get enough of the Bretzels. I also love Vienna, Munich and Berlin in a way that I can't say the same of for equal French cities. But I still love Paris and Marseille and so on. Especially their wines and cheeses. But then again... The Francophone World does have Bruxelles, and French is still a very important language in North Africa. Ach, so much to love about both of them :)

Word order will become second nature to you, if you give it time. If you keep speaking, reading and writing then a lot of the grammar rules and vocabulary you find difficult now, you will hardly even remember are rules. A good tip, though, when internalising these rules, is to get a native speaker to write you down a bunch of phrases. One of my teachers did this with essay phrases in German for on one hand/einerseits, on the other hands/anderseits, Ich stimme dir zu einem gewissen Grad zu/I agree to you to a certain extent, meine Meinung nach/my opinion (regarding...).

true,Parabellum8g,NETH,Indifference is the best kind of tolerance (/s),"Well, the problem I tend to have with the social sciences is that, although they have a much wider scope than say mathematics for example, it will likely remain a descriptive discipline in the end. Social sciences are great for measuring, but not for drawing conclusions. That's why I said that, and that sure as hell isn't unreasonable.
 
Sure, racism can be subconscious. I believe there was this little association test (something with reaction speeds to certain images) developed by psychologists that proved people actually can be a subconscious racist without actually knowing it themselves. What I have noticed over the years however - and with me a lot of other people in this country - as that the label 'racist' is being applied at random way too often. And that - is a major insult to people that haven't done anything racist or moreover, discriminatory in nature. Hence my reservation on the subject.
 
I propose that we shift our focus from describing the nature of the problem towards simply solving it. I don't have all the answers, but I figure that a watertight system would be a good start. Make sure that no one that doesn't master Dutch for example manages to slip through, and as a result having problems integrating in society. 
 
As for the people that have been here for a longer time:  it sure isn't ethical to force them show up for a language test (just to name an impossible example), but there should always be a way for people to improve themselves and solve their own issues. In short: the government should always be willing to help and be open to helping other people, without creating a system in which people will be dependant on the government at the same time.

He also find Portuguese people inferior yet charming. He's a poshy chauvinist, let's leave it at that.

The one in his 30's has all the diplomas he could get in economics just so he could avoid actual empreneurship just to get a comfortable teaching career at some university.

The one in his 40's is a charlatan who owns houses in Portugal, loans them without contract to other foreign people and blackmails them with putting them out of the apartment unless they pay more than the next guy in line to be tricked by his business prowess.

true,Asyx,NRWW,Nordrhein-Westfalen,"&gt; Sorry this is so disjointed, I'm fairly sleep deprived at the moment.

Sleep. Then come back. It's a bad idea to think about that stuff if you're sleepy.

You are a German citizen. No matter what you've got the right to stay here and claim unemployment benefits in general. I don't know if that works since you're only 19. As far as I know, if you're younger than 25, they can force you to stay at your parents house if you're unemployed.

So look that up!

If I were in your situation, I'd do the following (providing I had the desire to go to Germany no matter what). Start learning German. School year just started anyway. German IS NOT a hard language. It's REALLY closely related to English. Go to /r/languagelearning and ask how to go on about that. Then make sure you know what you're getting into. Do you even want to stay in Germany? Don't forget, you're an EU student. You can move to Ireland or the UK as well if the language is in the way. Scotland has cheap education as well. If you go for education, Germany is your best bet since you get all the stuff I'd get too. Something to note for bafög, they need to know the income of your parents. Look up what happens if you can't provide that. You might be a Härtefall (particularly bad situation) which would mean they let that slide.

Then see what you can do with what you have. High School in Germany (Abitur) is your American high school plus private college prep courses. So a school might be better than a university. You can get Bafög for that as well and don't even have to pay that back. A friend of mine did that and could finance that with bafög as well. 

Now that you know what you want, look for a city. I'd suggest something cheap but something where you can get to a more economically strong place easily. People here suggest the south. You're short on money... Might as well buy a round trip ticket.

Essen is cheap. You can be in Düsseldorf quite easily which is expensive but also economically stronger. 

The good thing with the Ruhrgebiet (Essen, Dortmund, Duisburg, Bochum etc) is that it's cheap and cities are cramped next to each other. So even though there is still a city between Düsseldorf and Essen if you take the train, it takes you maybe an hour to get to Düsseldorf. 

So now that you've got your general region, look for schools. There's the Heinrich-Hertz Berufskolleg, for example. You can do Abitur or Fachabitur there. Fachabitur has less requirements and allows you only to study at a University of applied science. That is not a bad thing with engineering. The 2 kinds of universities are actually almost equal just with different focus. For example, a University of Applied Science does research for the industry instead of for academics. Their degrees are compatible. You can get your Bachelor on a FH (university of applied science) and then do your Master on a academic university. Or your master on an FH and the PhD on a university. Most FHs work together with universities, by the way. So, if you study Engineering at the FH Dortmund. You will probably have an easy time getting a masters at the university of Dortmund if you want to. 

But back to school. At that school, you can get your ITA or ETA with FHR or AHR. ITA is information technology assistant. Basically, an apprenticeship related to CS. Not really that useful but it gives you initial knowledge people want to see for a proper apprenticeship or university. ETA is the same but with electronics. FHR is the Fachabitur which I explained above. AHR is the general university ""maturity"" (weird translation... it makes sense in German) which would allow you to study anything anywhere you want. 

So now you know where you want to live and what you want to do. Now the flat. I'd suggest getting flat mates. That's the cheapest way. wg-gesucht.de is a German platform for that sort of thing. Just find something that might not look too expensive.

So now that you know where you live and where you'd want to go to school and what a flat/room might cost, you can try to figure the money thing out. Unemployment support might be an option. Bafög might be an option. That's pretty complicated and probably hard to look up.

That's how I'd do it. Learn German for half a year or more (probably more if it's your first foreign language but with the right amount of motivation, it is possible), figure that stuff out, move. 

Alternatives are Ireland and Scotland since the English will suck you dry in terms of money for education.

Most important thing: DO NOT let people tell you that learning German or moving to Germany as an American is impossible. German is very close to English and you're not American. You're German. You've got THE RIGHT to live in this country. You've got THE RIGHT to move to other EU countries and work and live there.

true,KGB_for_everyone,RUSS,༼ つ ◕3◕ ༽つ,"How should i put this? Current Russian economic model (sell recourses, produce nothing ourselves, import a shit ton of essentials) has reached its peak/very close to it, thus Russian standard of life will no longer improve. If you take into account annual inflation in Russia of 7+%, it in fact will decline. Ofc this is **extremely oversimplified**, but Russian economy is in deep shit and first signs of that development were seen even in 2013 before any Ukrainian events.


At first it would be blamed on sanctions/West/insert excuse here, then when excuses will no longer work/fly with population Government will crackdown heavily on any dissent (whats going on right now is pretty much nothing compared to things to come lets say 4-5 years from now on). If you need comparisons - authoritarian state with extreme control from security apparatus, Qaddafi, Assad and others come to mind, maybe a bit ""lighter"".


The reason i am optimisticly pessimistic is that i have seen how Russian Government and economical bloc works, what sort of reforms are being implemented, their success rate, accuracy of forecasts, general direction of proposed laws, ""professionalism"" of business&amp;banks + a general idea how population will react to any of the ""new great ideas bestowed on population from Olympus"". 


Pretty much zero faith that anything would be reformed in any meaningful way or that population will embrace any of the changes is a political reality in Russia. Obviously no one is going to reassess our rearmament programs, dozens of billions of $ thrown into World Cups, ""mega projects"" by state-run companies and other ""investments"".


Thus Russia is destined to fail in one way or another, as Russia will grow weaker, geopolitical situation inside and outside of Russia will dictate significant changes in Russian sphere of influence so to speak. First places to look would be loosing grasp on Central Asian republics and big troubles in Eurasian Union (whatever that thing was called anyway). After that its a free-for-all , i can see Caucasus being on fire again,if you ask will Syberia/Far East try to breakaway the answer is no.


As for event horizon id say next 5 years is crucial for survival of Russia in its current incarnation, if we fail, then i can see same problems that plagued Russia in XX century making a spectacular comeback and history might repeat itself :) (so overall a 10 year time lag).",0,1411263815,null,0,1411264097,0,cko1yk2,t3_2gy9jm,t1_cko1yk2,t1_cko0eai,null,1426900655,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,ZaphodTwoFace,BERL,Berlin,"The not speaking German part is kind of a big problem. I know of people have suggested other places but I feel Berlin is your best bet to get by on English alone. 

To learn German (which you have to do, no alternative) I suggest using Duolingo.com, paired with actual IRL practice of course. I've used Duolingo for learning Spanish and it's been great. I feel like you have to sort the language thing out before anything else, which shouldn't be hard living here but I understand that it would be tough for you to make the transition period financially. If you end up studying German and ever want someone to answer a question (I know sometimes you just want to ask a native speaker rather than consult a dictionary and conjugation tables for 20 mins), chat with for practice or whatever else, feel free to pm me. 

Hope this helps a little, I'm from Berlin but live in Panama right now so I can't help out with job search or anything like that. Hope you'll land on your feet, know that as a German citizen you'd be eligible for social services (unemployment benefits) if you declare yourself unemployed. (I think, not 100% sure. I'm looking some stuff up and make an edit In a bit.) 

Edit: Did some searching for you-  
**Dual Citizenship** Nope! Germany doesn't accept it. At the age of 18 you have to decide if you want to be a German or not. I may not correctly understand how dual citizenship works, but I can't see how the German government would force you to give up your US-passport? Can anyone enlighten me on that?  
**Unemployment Benefits** We call this ALG and ALGII or HarzIV (ALG=Arbeitslosengeld≅Unemployment Benefits) and to be eligible you have to fit several criteria: You have to be over 15yrs old and not yet over retirement age, able to work (not disabled as that would be a different kind of benefit you'd be applying for), in need of financial support and live in Germany. You can apply for benefits even if you're not a German citizen, as long as you lived in Germany and had a permit to work here. You won't be eligible if you were to act in a way that would prevent you from actually working (like being in a different place or outright refusing offers for work), if you are an apprentice (in which case you'd likely be eligible for BAföG). To be considered as in need of financial support, you have to be earning less than what it would take to lead a dignified life.  
**Degrees and Education** This is a rough one. To apply for University you have to have a degree from finishing the German high school, called the Abitur or Fachabitur (this one you get at a school for specific job training). To get either you have to speak German, and well too. Sorry but your idea of going to Uni as an engineer seems to depend on you becoming fluent in German first, I'm not aware of a way around it.

Don't forget the social stigma: Young, **no qualification**, no job, **no German skills**, on welfare. Nobody is going to hire OP. A few years later when he's finally able to speak German fluently, he'll be too old for a (good) job. And the only ""qualification"" he'll have is ""been on welfare for a long time"". It's likely that he ends up doing the same shitty jobs he originally wanted to escape.

Before OP moves to Germany (without ever having been here before, I assume), he should learn German and save some money first. Because that's the best start in a foreign country. With some money left he can easily rent a flat, with German skills he can easily attend school.

First you start off by saying ""Not 80% of all casualties were Bosniak, but 75-80% of civilian casulties [wiki]"" 

So you're telling me more than 70% of the civilian casualties during the war were Bosnians, and then you go on to say 

""What I disagree with, though, is that there was systematic, organized and planned ethnic cleansing, which would constitute genocide. There was none of that.""

If 80,000 Bosnians being killed was not genocide, may I ask you what is? 

""The ICJ held that the Srebrenica massacre was a genocide. It stated the following:

The Court concludes that the acts committed at Srebrenica falling within Article II (a) and (b) of the Convention were committed with the specific intent to destroy in part the group of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina as such; and accordingly that these were acts of genocide, committed by members of the VRS in and around Srebrenica from about 13 July 1995.""

Now here is when you reply that Bosnian's have been attacking Serbian villages. Yes, they have. They attacked villages, and took military personnel as P.O.W.S. They did not rape innocent women and kill 4 year old children like the Serbians. So the Bosnians kill 5 villagers, who were soldiers, which justifies the genocide of 5k civilians?

Please explain to me how Srebrenica was not pre-planned? Did they just decide to to walk into town one day and kill 5,000 people? 

By saying Croats and Serbs constitute the majority in BiH, do you somehow think that Croats would honestly vote to let RS succeed? You've got to be kidding me.

And do you honestly believe that Serbs were going to favor succeeding from Yugoslavia? The laws were heavily in favor of Serbs, which were not the majority in Bosnia. The majority of Bosnia favored succession. 

The Ottomans never committed genocide against the Serbs. please give me a historical document stating the Ottomans rounded up 5,000 Serbs and killed them in the matter of days. LOL if you believe that serbs were being ethnically cleansed in Bosnia during WW2. Croatia? Yes. Serbia? Yes. In Bosnia? Bosnia was left pretty much untouched during WW2. 

Izetbegovic did not catapult Bosnia into a war. Just because he withdrew his signature doesn't mean he gathered up his army to attack and kill innocent civilians like the serbs did, LMAO. If anything you're only saying here that you do agree the serbs started the war.

These are mostly artists that have emerged in the last 5 to 10 years (with a couple of notable exceptions) and in no way reflect what I listen to - I tried to imagine what you would want to explore, given the current state of musical affairs and your age. Also, I tried to stick to those actually performing in Italian but some exceptions slipped in nonetheless. Sorry!

* Amari are interesting in that they started as a hip-hop band and they slowly but steadily moved towards more rock/pop sounds. Their latest album came out last year and is a blend of electro/folk/pop. Worth checking out are also the other artists working under their Farraginoso label umbrella, such as Fare Soldi, who are much more in the dance vein. 

* Lo Stato Sociale hail from Bologna and mix a bit of electro, à la LCD Soundsystem, with pop &amp; rock vibes. Clever/smart-arse lyrics. Foxhound are kind of in the same league, from Torino, they have a much more international appeal (they performed at the Primavera Sound).

* If you're into electronic music, K-Conjog, Godblesscomputers, SybiAnn, Avatism, M+A, Pink Holy Days are worth checking out. They range from more accessible, pop sounds to techno-ish atmospheres. Aucan are also worth listening to, but they're a bit of a standalone, music-wise.

* Should you want to listen to any new-ish singer-songwriter, keeping in mind that what you will hear is obviously and to varying degrees influenced by the masters of the Italian scene, you might want to try Colapesce, Bianco, Nicolò Carnesi, Jack Jaselli.

* From Seventies rock to punk to garage/blues influenced sounds and back again: Giuda, Sick Tamburo, Mojomatics (sadly, they just disbanded), Bud Spencer Blues Explosion, Thee Elephant.

* metal/avantgarde/emo-core/other out there sounds: Cibo, Teho Teardo (his latest album has Blixa Bargeld of Einsturzende Neubaten fame singing *also* in Italian), Altro, Titor, finebeforeyoucame, Zu, Gazebo Penguins.

* if you’re into hip-hop at all, I’d recommend Ghemon (fun fact: his latest album sees as guests most of the bands other people have already recommended, such as Calibro 35, Baustelle, Afterhours…), Coez, Achille Lauro, Metal Carter.

This is mostly my own theory crafting, but I feel like Germans up until this youngest Generation have had grandparents who fought in World War II and I don't know any granddad who would've had positive stories to tell about it. We're very sensitive to patriotism and pro-war attitudes, having seen what  war at home does to people, cities, and a country as a whole. Many cities were largely destroyed in firestorm bombings. 

Then during the cold war, both Germanys were used as a highly militarised buffer zone between the superpowers. 

I'd just say we're fed up with militarism and war in general. 

And concerning your last question: yes, most Germans I know regard American military policy as warmongering, and yes, most of these people including me are insanely weirded out by how Americans show their love for all things shooty and their troops. When ~~Horst Köhler~~ looks like it was Peter Struck said, our soldiers were defending our freedom at the Hindu Kush, there was massive backlash because people do not automatically regard soldiers as heros. The prevalent attitude toward soldiers being killed in action I've seen, which is also my personal attitude, is 'if you decide to be a soldier and get killed, tough luck, soldiers die, don't expect any special condolences'.

true,Staxxy,YAFrance,France,"Je viens de télécharger *Rich Hill* (pas dispo légalement en France), un documentaire se concentrant sur la vie de trois garcons dans une petite ville paupérisée du Missouri rural. Le film a remporté le Prix du Jury dans la catégorie Documentaire au Festival Sundance 2014.


*Rich Hill* dépeint le niveau extraordinaire de carence économqie qui domine les Etats-Unis aujourd'hui.


A seulement quelques centaines de kilomètres au sud-est de Ferguson, Missouri, la banlieue de St. Louis devenue la scène de protestations à grande échelle et de répression intense, la communauté rurale et blanche de *Rich Hill* appartient au même univers social.


Les conditions de vie de la petite ville rentreraient parfaitement dans le décor d'un pays du tiers-monde. En fait, on pourrait décrire Rich Hill comme ""sous-dévellopé"" - en état de décomposition incontrôlée. Un ancien centre minier, dont l'industrie a fermé au tournant du siècle, les statistiques de Rich Hill sont sans équivoque. Presque un tiers de la population vit en dessous du seuil de pauvreté officiel (en réalité, la ""ligne de subsistence""), contrastant avec la moyenne du Missouri, 15%.


Les réalisateurs décrivent Rich Hill comme ""Everytown, USA"". Le site internet du film note que ""on vit toujours ici: 1393 au derniers recensement."" De profonds nids de poule se multiplient sur les routes, et la taxe foncière est quasi-négligeable. Le centre-ville est jonché de briques, et quelques bâtiments en ruines sont tout ce qu'il reste de la banque, la pharmacie, et du café.


Regardant la jeunesse de Rich Hill comme représentative de ""beaucoup de jeunes américains"", les créateurs du film concentrent leur attention sur trois adolescents:


Andrew, 14 ans, dont la famille a déménagé à une douzaine de reprise, à la recherche d'opportunités économiques inexistantes. Son père Willie est un guitariste talentueux particulièrement doué dans les morceaux de Hank Williams; sa mère Elizabeth, clouée au lit par sa dépression, meurt à l'âge de 39 ans à cause d'une surdose de médicament. Dans une scène du film, Willie remplit la baignoire avec de l'eau chauffée dans une poêle et une machine a café .

La famille, qui compte aussi la soeur de Andrew, Alyssa, perds son domicile et doit vivre avec des cousins. Andrew s'adresse à la caméra, défiant: ""We’re not trash; we’re good people.""


Appachey, 13 ans, est affecté par un Trouble du déficit de l'attention, un désordre bipolaire, un TOC, et peut-être le Syndrome d'Asperger, selon sa mère Delena, une femme articulée, forte, surpassée par ses circonstances. Entre le maintien de sa famille et son travail, elle tente sans succès de s'élever au dessus de la misère et de la destitution de leur vie. Elle dit aux réalisateurs qu'elle ""n'a jamais pu se permettre d'avoir des rêves ou des idéaux pour elle"". Appachey est envoyé dans un centre de détention pour mineur après avoir attaqué un autre étudiant. 


Le plus troublé des trois est Harley, 15 ans. (Je ne suis pas heureux, je suis un gosse complètement dérangé""). Avec un sens de l'humour excentrique mais attachant, il vit avec sa grand-mère. Sa mère Joann est incarcérée pour tentative de meurtre sur le beau-père de Harley, qui abusait sexuellement son fils. Harley est fidèle à sa mère, dont l'emprisonnement est perçu comme une injustice. Un délinquant chronique, il abandonne l'école. Le site internet du film explique qu'on a diagnostiqué chez Harley une tumeur au cerveau, qui a gagné le nerf optique.


La situation douloureuse de ces trois familles, ainsi que de l'ensemble de la population de Rich Hill, force l'empathie.


Dans une scène amèrement iconique, la population marque la fête nationale (4 Juillet) avec une version pitoyablement interprétée de l'hymne national, ainsi qu'une vente aux enchères pour financer le feux d'artifice.


La Pauvreté, qui engouffre de vaste sections de la population américaine, est rarement traitée directement par le cinéma national. *Rich Hill* est une exception notable. C'est une exposition qui va jusqu'a l'intime, empathique de bout en bout à l'égard de ses victimes dans la jeunesse et la communauté en général, qui comme beaucoup, vacillent dans le précipice économique.

Le documentaire offre une vue de près sur la pauvreté abjecte et la destruction délibérée de vies précieuses. *Rich Hill* démontre aussi, par son absence, ce qui manque de la vie sociale américaine: Un système de protection sociale, qui a été tour a tour déchiqueté par les Démocrates et les Républicains a tout les niveaux de gouvernement. Dans la guerre actuelle contre les travailleures, des familles entières et même des communautés sont poussées dans l'abysse. Andrew, Appachey, et Harley  espèrent une vie meilleure. Une telle perspective est condamnée à la fin de non-recevoir.


Il est curieux, sans être sensationnel, que *Rich Hill*, en tant que film, tends vers la passivité et la résignation. N'ayant pas vu de leurs propres yeux une lutte de masse, les réalisateurs voient les oppressés comme des victimes en premier lieux, et n'envisagent pas une éruption d'outrage et de révolte.

I was in the army myself when it was still compulsive. The line of thought was more like ""meh, I guess it's useful to be here if Germany ever gets attacked, but that is not going to happen anyway. And I'm only doing this because I have to."" I would never have dreamed going to town in uniform, not because I was afraid of getting a beating, but because being a soldier is not something you are proud of. Having to do a ""Fahnenappel"" (saluting the flag while it's raised or lowered) felt totally weird. I still find it strange that people like to hang out flags during the worldcup, even though it has become a habit.

Patriotism is not a big thing in Germany (see our history for the reason). Germany doesn't meedle in the affairs of other nations using military force. And I think that's the right thing to do. Defending oneself is one thing, being aggressive to some other country and trying to shove your own culture down their throat is another thing. 

There's also a strong movement against everything military (""Alle Soldaten sind Mörder"", all soldiers are killers). Think America in the 60s or 70s. So while ""getting beat up"" is unlikely unless you run into drunk idiots who are just looking for an excuse to have a fight, ""being frowned upon"" and ""drawing looks"" is definitely true.

That said, I disagree with quite a few of the minor points (e.g. ""Germany’s army is [...] created not so much to wage wars but to atone for the past"") of the article. The author is obviously writing from the outside and trying to make sense of something he has no firsthand experience with, and so quite a few of his guesses he presents as facts are wrong.

You would not get beaten up for joining the army in my home area, but you would be one out of perhaps 50 people to be drafted and not take the alternative ""community service"" instead of joining the army. And joining the army for an even longer period was seen as very weird.

As to America: Yes, we think its weird how you glorify everything around your military. Most Germans even think its weird that you are allowed to wear weapons in public as a civilian. Guns are seen as bad over here because they kill people.

It seems to me the U.S. has a great tradition of gloryfiying the military because the U.S. were founded after an independence war. So the miltary made this nation possible in the start. Modern Germany has seen the downside of war. The loss of humans, the destruction of your home, your economy, your infrastructure. Thats why we fear the war.

When I went into the Kosovo with the German army, I did not think ""Yay, we will save the poor people"". My main thought was ""diplomacy has failed and now we may be forced to kill people because of that."" Still I felt mission like these needed to be done, because the alternative would have been worse but I that does not mean I did like it.

EDITED to add this:

Most of the lower ranks in the army are people who won't become a doctor or something like that. And most of them drink a lot. That's why society does not have a very high opinion of them as well.

Just because paramilitary groups, lower levels of Army and locals committ ethnic cleansing in some areas, that doesn't constiute genocide. It's ethnic cleansing, and as such should be prosecuted, but it's not genocide.

&gt;""The ICJ held that the Srebrenica massacre was a genocide. It stated the following:

&gt;The Court concludes that the acts committed at Srebrenica falling within Article II (a) and (b) of the Convention were committed with the specific intent to destroy in part the group of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina as such; and accordingly that these were acts of genocide, committed by members of the VRS in and around Srebrenica from about 13 July 1995.""

Have you ever watched an ICTY trial? 90% of evidence is hearsay (only Bosniak and Croat hearsay is taken as evidence, not Serbian hearsay), almost no eyewitness testimony, except the few nontransparent ones where there's no way of knowing who exactly is testifying, no material evidence to confirm the intent to destroy etc.

In any normal court, almost every Serb in the Hague would have walked out years ago for lack of evidence. That's the very reason the U.S. doesn't allow its citizens be tried there.

&gt;Now here is when you reply that Bosnian's have been attacking Serbian villages. Yes, they have. They attacked villages, and took military personnel as P.O.W.S. They did not rape innocent women and kill 4 year old children like the Serbians. So the Bosnians kill 5 villagers, who were soldiers, which justifies the genocide of 5k civilians?

Srebrenica was designated as safe area. Serb Army couldn't attack it because of it, and in return they were promised that the area is demilitarized. It wasn't and excursions to Serb villages were constant. Though Serb victims may have been smaller in numbers, it was because it's not very easy to do excursions out to dispersed and low populated Serb villages outside of UN safe heaven, while the retribution that followed those excursions was targeted at Bosniaks who were all rounded up in one place -- Srebrenica.

&gt;kill 4 year old children like the Serbians.

You couldn't find an even more isolated fringe case than that to portray Serbs as evil savages?

Women and children of Srebrenica were transported outside of it to Bosniak held areas.

Every male of military age was considered a soldier, rounded up and killed. Not just or fair, but when put in context, you can understand their reasoning.

&gt;Please explain to me how Srebrenica was not pre-planned? Did they just decide to to walk into town one day and kill 5,000 people?...

How much planning does any retribution entail? It wasn't planning with intent to destroy a nation, it was ""planning"" to clear the area of potential military threats and those who've been terrorizing the surrounding Serb villages.

You should watch and independent Norwegian documentary about Srebrenica, which interviews, among others, members of Bosnian Army: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUuhSGnLvv8

&gt;By saying Croats and Serbs constitute the majority in BiH, do you somehow think that Croats would honestly vote to let RS succeed? You've got to be kidding me.

Croats which live outside of RS, or anyone that lives outside of RS, for that matter, won't get the chance to vote.

Second, Croats are already feeling royally fucked by post-war organization of Bosnia. If not for independence of their own, they'll fight for bigger autonomy at least -- the same thing RS has. Serbs wouldn't mind staying in Bosnia, if Sarajevo wasn't actively advocating the dismantling of ""genocidal entity"". That's why we want to leave.

&gt;And do you honestly believe that Serbs were going to favor succeeding from Yugoslavia? The laws were heavily in favor of Serbs, which were not the majority in Bosnia. The majority of Bosnia favored succession.

Bullshit. Find me the exact law in which the Serbs have an advantage to others. Croats only favored the secession of Bosnia so they themselves could secede from Bosnia and join Croatia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croat%E2%80%93Bosniak_War

&gt;The Ottomans never committed genocide against the Serbs. please give me a historical document stating the Ottomans rounded up 5,000 Serbs and killed them in the matter of days.

They didn't round them up and kill 5'000 in a day, but Serbs had a legal status of second-class citizens for the entirety of centuries long Ottoman occupation of Bosnia, while converts to Islam had normal rights.

If you fought for your rights, you were impaled. And Ottomans were particularly good at it. The victim would live on for hours after impalement, dangling on the pole. Those are the fond collective memories the Serbs have of the Ottoman era.

&gt;LOL if you believe that serbs were being ethnically cleansed in Bosnia during WW2. Croatia? Yes. Serbia? Yes. In Bosnia? Bosnia was left pretty much untouched during WW2.

Independent State of Croatia included entire Bosnia:

&gt;The estimate of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is that the Ustaša authorities murdered between 320,000 and 340,000 ethnic Serb residents of Croatia and Bosnia during the period of Ustaše rule, out of which between 45,000 and 52,000 were murdered in the Jasenovac concentration camp.[12]

Map of concentration camps, Bosnia included:

&gt;Izetbegovic did not catapult Bosnia into a war. Just because he withdrew his signature doesn't mean he gathered up his army to attack and kill innocent civilians like the serbs did, LMAO. If anything you're only saying here that you do agree the serbs started the war.

""Oh yeah, I'll withdraw this signature that could prevent war by being the only reasonable solution, at behest of US ambassador, because unified Bosnia suits Bosniaks better.""

No, fuck that. Serbs will never agree to be ruled by Bosniaks and Croats. We will always fight to be free and govern ourselves.

true,Ian666,null,null,"Gender and language is actually beeing more and more discussed in germany. Let me give you a brieve overview, about what is the problem:

The german langauge has genders, so a word can be male and female (and neuter). Lets call this genders ""language genders"". However, this male and female language genders can be split up in natural and grammatical genders. DER Löffel (spoon) and DER Arbeiter (male worker) both are male language gender words, but the former is only grammatically (a spoon has no ""biological"" gender or a gender in and of itself) male, while  the latter is natural male. 

So whats the fuzz about? Exactly about what you are asking: The question is, how should one refer to a group of people, that consist of male and female persons.

No problem arises with grammatical gender. You have ""DER Löffel"" (meaning one spoon) and ""DIE Löffel"" (meaning two or more spoons).

No problem arises with singular natural gender. You have ""Der Arbeiter macht eine Pause"" (The (male) worker takes a break) and ""Die Arbeiterin macht eine Pause"" (The (female) worker takes a break).

The problem arises with natural gender in the plural. If you talk about 2 or more only male workers talking a break, you say ""Die Arbeiter machen eine Pause"" - you see, the word ""Arbeiter"" doesnt change, its the same for singular and plural. The Plural is marked in this case by the changing of DER to DIE. 
When you talk about 2 or more only female workers, you say ""Die Arbeiterinnen machen eine Pause"". In this case, the plural is marked by the change of the word itself, Arbeiterinnen.

So: What do you say, when you want to say, that a group of workers, consisting of both male and female workes, are taking a break? 

The conservative position is to use the plural male form of the word while claiming, that in this case it means both male and female workers. So the conservative claim is that ""Die Arbeiter machen eine Pause"" can mean both that either a group of male only workers is taking a break, or that a group of male and female workers is taking a break. The call this ""generisches masculinum"" or ""generic masculinum"", claiming, that plural form of singular natural male gendered word actually refers to both male and female.

However, this is wrong (although it is almost religiously discussed). Studies show, and this goes for german native speakers as well, that when you read a sentence like ""Die Arbeiter machen eine Pause"", you always think of a group of only male workers first. And then, in a second step, you have to conclude in your mind from the context of the sentence, if maybe in this case female workers are meant too.

The progressive point of view is, that although many people subscribe to the conservative point of view, the (written) language should actually reflect that women exist. So, when you talk about a group of male and female persons, the language should not use the male only plural form.

For more, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_neutrality_in_languages_with_grammatical_gender#German

So, what can you do?

The first thing you could do, which would be the conservative position, is to write the male version of a word - ""Wie kann ein Deutscher"" - and claim, that this refers to female germans also. 

The second things is, you could write for exmaple Deutsche_r or Deutsche*r  - in this way, your writing acknowledges, that women actually exist. This form will be appreciated in liberal and progressive circles, and more and more in the mainstream, but may raise an eyebrow with conservative readers. (the most common form of this is the ""Binnen-I"", like in ""ArbeiterInnen = Arbeiter and Arbeiterinnen = male and female workers) 

The third thing is to find a neutral-gendered word for what you want to say. For example instead of Studenten (male students) and Studentinnen (female students), you could say Studierenden (literally: People that are studying). In your case, you could use, as already answered, ""Wie können Deutsche"".",0,1411288961,null,0,1411294416,0,cko9s6p,t3_2h0q9w,t1_cko9s6p,t3_2h0q9w,null,1426896900,-1,false,German,t5_2qq51,-1

Je suis d'accord. Je me définis encore comme féministe et je suis encore avec intérêt ce que dit Osez le féminisme, je crois encore à l'égalité des sexes et qu'elle n'est pas encore obtenue. Mais je répondrai avec ma question habituelle: Qu'est-ce que le féminisme? Il n'y a pas d'autorité centrale, de think tank, de papesse du féminisme pour définir le credo. Le féminisme, par conséquent, n'est que la somme des idées des groupes et des penseurs féministes. Or, dans le monde anglo-saxon principalement, je trouve que les groupes féministes les plus audibles (je ne dis pas ""la majorité"", parce que je veux croire qu'on est dans un cas typique de minorité vocale) ont perdu toute constructivité et se limitent maintenant à faire du lobbying revanchard. La loi d'affirmative consent californienne par exemple, qui n'aura aucune utilité sauf de rendre les gens paranoïaques.  Le lobbying que font certains groupes pour qu'à crimes égaux, les peines de prison soient éliminées exclusivement pour les femmes condamnées. Ce genre de chose. On a encore été relativement épargnés en France, mais je pense que ce genre de chose se développera vite ici.

&gt; C'est très dommage que beaucoup de gens semblent penser comme toi. Parce que des progrès pour l'égalité homme-femme, on en a beaucoup a faire. Et c'est malheureusement une des lutte qui a été complètement court-circuitée. Après je sais pas pourquoi ni comment.

C'est un mélange de radicalisation des groupes féministes et de crispation de ses opposants. Quand la plupart des combats du féminismes 2e vague ont été gagnés (avortement, pilule, droit au boulot...), le féminisme 3e vague s'est penché sur la culture, ce qui énerve beaucoup plus. La sensibilisation au viol, le harcèlement de rue, demandent des changements de comportement en profondeur qui vont rencontrer beaucoup plus de résistance. Et de leur côté, on a des groupes radicaux qui mélangent le féminisme à d'autres idéologies de combat, comme les Femen, qui font énormément de mal à la cause féministe.

C'est vrai que de moins en moins de gens se définissent comme féministes dans les sondages. Mais tu remarqueras que la réponse la plus courante à ces sondages est ""Je suis pour l'égalité des sexes, je pense qu'il faut continuer à se battre pour, mais je ne suis pas féministe"". LE problème à mon sens vient des groupes féministes eux-mêmes.

&gt; Et que surtout, le message féministe, c'est très loin d'être tout les hommes blancs hétérosexuels castrés hein.

Normalement, non, mais c'est ce que les gens entendent de plus en plus... Pas besoin de démonisation pour ça.

&gt; Devient pas un redpiller s'il te plait, je serais très triste.

Aucune chance, heh. C'est pas parce que je vois des failles dans le féminisme moderne que je vais commencer à militer pour le droit de battre sa femme ou la dépénalisation du viol conjugal. Je dirai même que c'est parce que je me définis comme féministe que je réagis comme ça; j'aimerais bien voir le mouvement réussir et il n'est pas en passe de le faire maintenant.

Actually, the reason Poles are generally liked by Ireland's working class is an interesting bit of cultural oddity. During the celtic tiger years there was tonnes of construction going on in Ireland and our working class were busily engaged in trying to do as little as possible while getting paid for it. On site. The poles in Ireland also enjoyed this particular profession, while also enjoying a drink and having a familiar caustic dry wit.

This caused the Irish construction workers and the polish construction workers to find themselves in bars together learning swear words in each others' languages (Kurwa!). It also lead to them giving out about their foreman at length, queuing together for breakfast rolls from spar at 8am, and various other activities engaged in by construction workers. During these activities they got to know each other and made friends.

And that is why your average unemployed working class man in Ireland has a lot of time for the poles. Because they're basically the same people except with weird russiany kind of accents, a fondness for good vodka and good looking girlfriends. I know, because I was there at the time. On site.

anschließend ein äußerst schönes Auslandssemester an der Georgia Tech Lorraine in Metz Frankreich, wo ich ein Interesse für Arbeit außerhalb der USA entwickelte.

Its easy to be rude, but it takes hell lot of an effort to make videos meant for kids.
Get a life Puffin and try to be mature &amp; constructive in your comments.

Why I got this in a PM rather than a comment, I've no idea. Hopefully I can enlighten you.

* Why comment as I did? It's Reddit, as long as I keep to the general rules regarding posting, in addition to specific requirements of different subreddits, I can speak freely. 

* Yes, I have made videos and they were funny. Although not appropriate for children or the easily offended. 

* I'm sure it is difficult to make videos meant for kids, so why make it harder for yourself by using terrible voices and mixing regional accents and screwing with the volume control?

* People are free to comment on something when you post it to a public forum where you are obviously looking for public comment. I could sit and take the piss out of the various English language mistakes you're making, but that would actually be 'derogatory' in the correct sense of the word. 

* A little analogy... guy around the corner sells kebabs... they're dreadful and I tell him this... it doesn't make my statement any less factually right or wrong if I don't own my own kebab shop.

* ""*Get a life?*""... I have a happy and fulfilling life, why would you question this? Unlike my statement regarding your video, you have no evidence to comment on my quality of life. ",0,1411291745,null,0,false,0,ckoa9l6,t3_2gy29b,t1_ckoa9l6,t1_cko2rqw,null,1426896675,2,false,German,t5_2qq51,2

Now as a matter of fact, most UBI proponents want to see UBI as part of a more redistributive program, and this is probably due to the fact that we are witnessing growing poverty and inequalities all over the globe. Therefore, UBI tend to embed itself in a progressive leftist agenda, as an instrument to correct past and present inequalities.

However, I am personally in favor of introducing a UBI as soon as possible, and even if it should be lower than a decent level for dignity.

&gt;Unemployed people get money from the government today – will they get more or less after implementation of BI? What about teachers, software developers, bus drivers, lawyers, etc?

All wages will have to be renegociated after the UBI is implemented. So your question is quite impossible to answer.

 As for unemployment benefit, some propose to keep it on top of a (low) basic income. While others propose to replace it by UBI. It is difficult to compare unemployment benefit with UBI because the benefit is only granted to one person in the household (the jobless person) while a basic income would be granted to all members of the household.",0,1411292721,null,0,false,0,ckoafaj,t3_2gvq7d,t1_ckoafaj,t1_cknqeaf,null,1426896601,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

He dismissed all valid economic and social concerns as  'scaremongering' and is now saying 'Scottish independence would be a fact were it not for Westminster trickery', which is very discrediting to himself and although I respect him very much as a political motivator and a general force for good in the UK political system, I am very happy to see him off.

Does the chamber remember when Gaddafi was our son of a bitch? He began to be so in the year 2000, when he privatized his oil companies so that Western multinationals could come in. It was the time when Gaddafi was the friend of Europe, when he collaborated with the migratory policy, in a militay way (manu militar -literally with a military hand-)i, as dictators do. It was the time when Gaddafi financed Mr. Sarkozy's electoral campaign and gifted horses to José María Aznar. Even in 2011, one month before NATO's intervention, the IMF praised Gaddafi's economic reforms. What happened in March? What happened is that the United Nations Security Council in their 1973 resolution appealed to the responsibility of protecting the civil population, and thus the military intervention, whose consequences we are discussing now, began. However, chamber, that had nothing to do with defending the civil population, it had to do with defending the interests of Western oil companies given the possibility of Russian, Chinese, and Indian companies exploiting Libya's resources. That is why those three nations abstained in the Security Council. I do not ask you to stop being what you are, but at least do not lie to the people.""

the response by Ana María Gomes, a representative from the social-democratic Socialist Party in Portugal:

""Mr. Igelasias, do you ignore the fight of the Libyan people to free themselves from Gaddafi's murderous dictatorship? Because this was the determining factor of the revolution that was carried out , of course, with foreign help. This happened and I was there and I saw it with my own eyes; at the front, the young ones fought against Gaddafi's dictatorship. Where were you when this was happening? Is it that you forget everything? Everything works to attack the forces that admittedly did take advantage of Gaddafi's dictatorship?"" (These forces being the West, I think.)

Iglesias' response:

""Thank you very much for the question señora Gomes. You are right, there were many democrats that opposed Gaddafi in Libya, but those democrats that opposed Gaddafi never once received aid from NATO or from Eu nations when Sarkozy's campaign was being financed or when Gaddafi became the EU's migratory policy's major ally. Let us not lie, the intervention in Libya was not carried out to ensure the rights of the civil population, the intervention was exclusively carried out on behalf of multinational interests. Enough, stop pulling the people's legs (Ya basta de tomarle el pelo a la gente) señora Gomes.""",0,1411294538,null,0,1411309985,0,ckoap5i,t3_2h0w1m,t1_ckoap5i,t3_2h0w1m,null,1426896473,40,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,40

You're entirely right that dependence on tourism is unhealthy. We say that if tourism contributes to more than 12% of the annual GDP, it's bad. France isn't at that level because thankfully it has other important industries. That's not the case for many island nations, or even bigger nations like Tunisia before the Arab spring. Also indeed, culture can be destroyed by too much tourism, wherein the culture becomes faked, as a mere attraction, but the common conclusion in the tourism industry is that France is generally not a victim of that. Apart from some sites which may loose their original charm, like the Mont Saint Michel, the rest of us continue our daily lives, and live how we want to live, regardless of whether or not it pleases tourists. This is the case for most western countries.

Where this sort of thing is more of a problem is in those nations which more heavily depend on tourism. Usually ""third world"" countries. Small island nations again, or certain regions of Africa, where locals may sometimes dress up as ""traditional"" warriors and dance around in shows to please tourists.

C'est un blog de féministe que j'ai trouvé très bien.

Et j'ai commencé a croire que une partie de la mauvaise idée que les gens ont des féministes, est liée a l'essor des groupes genre les MRA et TRP, qui justement poussent a la caricature, pour que les hommes se sentent attaqués et rejoignent ceux qui ""défendent la virilité"". Et que comme beaucoup semblent d'accord pour attaquer le féminisme, forcément il y a une réaction de défense qui en radicalise beaucoup. (Comme avec l'Islam, avec probablement les même provocateurs)

Dans le même genre que pour la Manif pour tous, le mariage homo c'est une attaque sur le mariage, sur la famille et ils remplissent les rues en répandant ce genre de message. Alors qu'au final, pas du tout.

Après oui, des féministes cramées du cerveau il y en a trop. Tout comme y'a encore des maoistes plus que convaincus. Récemment sur badhistory ils parlaient d'un mec qui disait que les morts du Grand Bond en avant c'était un complot. Ou ceux qui pensent que Staline c'est un leader parfait.

On se sert souvent de ces exemples pour démoniser le communisme/socialisme, alors que dans la réalité c'est vraiment pas ça .

Je pense que le féminisme a pour vocation d'être une ""idéologie de combat"". Pour moi y'a juste un Triptyque Socialisme-Ecologie-Féminisme ( qui au final ont la même volonté, mais tirent la couverture de leur côté pour que leur vision des choses s'impose) de mouvements ""progressistes"" qui gagneraient à s'unifier et à prononcer un message clair, indiscutable( et raisonnable).",0,1411295810,null,0,false,0,ckoaxah,t3_2gwebj,t1_ckoaxah,t1_cko9vsz,null,1426896367,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

Probably because there's a lot of English people on this subreddit who didn't want to see the UK broken up.

Another reason may merely be how the governments of the UK and Spain have treated the idea of independence for their regions. I've probably got a few posts in my comment history that indicate support for an independent Catalonia but in reality it's not so much that I support independence, it's more that I support their right to vote.

Increasing the level of redistribution would probably lead to middle class getting poorer (that's where most of the tax revenue comes from AFAIK). I don't believe this is a good idea. If it was, we would have more calls for higher taxes and higher benefits without changing the whole system.

&gt; All wages will have to be renegociated after the UBI is implemented. So your question is quite impossible to answer.

This is quite an important question though – if I earn x per month, will I be richer or poorer under UBI? Otherwise, supporting UBI would be a lottery, a random change to my wage or to my benefits, I don't see any reason for that. Many UBI supporters seem have this idea of ""I will get money unconditionally, so I won't have to do this shitty job, I'll do whatever I want!"", which is quite naive. If you get richer by x, someone will get poorer by x.

**Different structure** – yes, I like the simplicity, but is there really no reason for the complexity of the current system?

This isn't the US so if the people want to know what the negotiations are about then tell your employer he should come here and explain why the treaty is beneficial to the EU rather than calling everyone out as scaremongers and idiots.

/r/europe isn't a TTIP lobby forum. This is a public discussion forum where people come to discuss and learn. There is a treaty being negotiated right now that involves all of us so it's perfectly normal that people will want to talk about the terms and effects of the agreement.

true,votapmen,SRPS,Република Српска — Republika Srpska,"What the citizens of the West fail to realize is that some regions of the World — Arab world, especially Middle East, included — need a strong dictator to keep the country stable.

Those areas are centuries behind Europe when it comes to political culture and are simply not ready for democracy. Nations have a natural course through which they develop, and one of the phases in that course — the one preceding democracy — is the phase of brutal monarchies or dictatorships that stabilize and homogenize the country to a functional degree. That's what happened in all of Western Europe.

For democracy to succeed, for it to function properly, it needs support of vast majority of the population. That vast majority has to actually want democracy. The majority of people who ""want democracy"" in the Arab World are actually just bitter that they're not running the show, that its not their guy that's dictating.

When a true democratic movement within the country gains enough momentum to be able to overthrow the oppressive regime itself — than democracy has a chance. If the democratic movement in the country needs foreign support, that means it doesn't have enough support within the country, which is prerequisite for democracy.

The Western democracies didn't install democracy at home through foreign support. They did it themselves.

Another problem with the Arab World (and a lot of the rest of the World) is that the Western colonialists created artificial borders as they colonized the regions. Those borders are unnatural, they do not correlate to the real situation and it's not the way they would have developed on their own, without foreign influence.

An Englishmen striking a thousand mile straight border through a region he first set his foot on a day ago, and ignoring the complexity of the historical, social and political context there, is one of the main reasons the Arab World and Middle East are such a massive clusterfuck today.

These are the major misconceptions based on which the Western citizens support intervention in those areas for the purpose of ""democratization"". That is simply a wrong thing to do. You're hindering the natural development of nations there. It may seem bloody and brutal to not get involved, but Europe was bloody and brutal before it became what it is today.

Due to European colonializam, that phase was simply put on hold in the colonies and it continued after decolonization. You just need to let it happen if you want the region to stabilize.

Of course, the interests of Western governments, the military-industrial-congressional complex of U.S. and profit hungry Western multinational companies who benefit from either destabilization and perpetual warfare or deregulated undeveloped markets, don't really help the situation and public perception of the region, either.

As to Gaddafi, he was actually one of the most benevolent dictators of the Arab World. He improved the living conditions and status of Libya as a sovereign country immensely.

But I guess Libya is better of today, because Gaddafi is gone and they have both ""political correctness"" and ""democracy"". Because ""democracy"" in the Arab World, at this stage of their political culture and general development means tribal warfare to decide who'll be the new dictator.

Do you want to know what happens if a Middle Eastern country actually uses democracy in a proper way (possibly because it's not Arab) to elect their representatives?

Really? So what these guys from FAO are talking about:

&gt; By 2050 the world’s population will reach 9.1 billion, 34 percent higher than today. Nearly all of this population increase will occur in developing countries. Urbanization will continue at an accelerated pace, and about 70 percent of the world’s population will be urban (compared to 49 percent today). Income levels will be many multiples of what they are now. **In order to feed this larger, more urban and richer population, food production (net of food used for biofuels) must increase by 70 percent.** Annual cereal production will need to rise to about 3 billion tonnes from 2.1 billion today and annual meat production will need to rise by over 200 million tonnes to reach 470 million tonnes.

Then use those funds to hire PMC support and conduct war the modern way that for example Russia and the USA are both already conducting it in Ukraine. I could donate a few bucks to the fight against Russia.
orters it has, these old nation states, except perhaps Russia, are behind the times when it comes to conducting a modern war.
The fund could even have returns to its investors in form of offering exclusive government contracts for when Ukraine is stabilized. Surely there's even more ways that money could be made off of this war, but at least I'm sure that PMCs would be a great opportunity for Ukraine.  
Currently there is fear of provoking Russia and escalating the conflict but if support against Russia was being funded through anonymous investments and the war conducted by private entities there would be no country that Russia could lash out against, Russia would be blind as to where the military support of Ukraine is coming from.

But I guess that to some extent this is already being done. I assume the Ukrainian government is contacting its friends all across the world and [Academi claimedly works within Ukraine](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-ukrainian-pendulum-two-invasions-and-a-putsch-american-special-forces-in-ukraine-under-cover/5372257). Most likely funded by American money.  
However I'm not seeing the big campaign of propaganda to gather support for Ukraine, Americans should use their media power to produce propaganda to gather more support. Sure the newsmedia is full of support for Ukraine but you could involve consumers with an aid campaign. Security is a fundamental part of human rights and aid money should be funneled to hire PMC support. ISIS also produces great propaganda, partly because of American supporters it has, these old nation states, except perhaps Russia, are behind the times when it comes to conducting a modern war.

But, like I said, probably more of this is already going on behind the curtains that we're being shown. Still, I think this war would be a great opportunity to experiment with new methods and especially the EU should be more pro-active in information and economic warfare than it currently is. I get this feeling that we're lacking vision to conduct a modern war around here and I should want to hear from some politicians here at least signalling willingness to up the covert game.

Pff. J'ai déjà mis le lien [ici](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/2gk59d/s%C3%A9rieux_redditeurs_qui_votentsoutiennent_le_fn/cklhy62) et visiblement tu ne l'as pas lu.

http://www.ined.fr/fr/ressources_documentation/focus_sur/double_nationalite_et_identite_nationale/

&gt;Je doute tres fortement que sa sois légale sur le plan juridique. 

Sur quelles bases ? Tu ne connais même pas ce qui est proposé et tu t'engages déjà sur une éventuelle légalité... C'est tout simplement ridicule.

&gt;C'est un cas flagrant d'inégalité et je doute que la cour constitutionnelle le permette ou la cour européenne. Basiquement parce que mon pays refuse de reconnaitre ma renonciation je n'ai aucun droit a la citoyenneté??

Déjà réfuté. Et encore une fois de quels pays parles-tu ?

&gt;Il s'agit clairement d'une loi qui vise certaine communauté
et d'ailleurs je me méfie encore plus du FN et de ses partisans.

Belle inversion de logique : Ne pas faire d'exception pour une certaine communauté devient viser une certaine communauté... C'est l'inverse : on fait la même loi pour tous et on n'accepte pas les exceptions.

&gt;Que tes chiffres étaient bidons ce qui s'est avéré vrai.

Quels chiffres ?

Je te demande pourquoi tu as parlé de ""remittance"" et tu réponds à côté de la plaque quand on te montre que ton argument ne tient plus...

&gt;Évidemment ta pris 1 donnée de la totalité pour montrer ton point

Non, j'ai également parlé des données totales. Je prends un exemple pour démontrer que ton argument de générosité n'est pas valable.

&gt;Mais curieux avant que la Belgique n'adopte la double citoyenneté en 2008 la contribution de ses expatriés était minime soudainement apres 2008 et ladoption de la double nationalité leurs contributions ont soudainement bondi a 3 milliards en 2012.

Et donc tu en conclues quoi sur la double nationalité ?

&gt;Non je ne l'ai pas lue envoie le lien avec la source précise svp.

http://lmgtfy.com/?q=programme+fn&amp;l=1

&gt;Ironique pour un parti qui veut sortir de l'UE

En quoi ?

Tu t'es planté en affirmant ""tu changes la position de ton parti qui elle était pour la perte de la double nationalité pour tous les pays ou qui ne l'a jamais réfuté"", reconnais ton erreur. En fait, depuis le début tu parles de quelque chose que tu ne connais pas. Comme d'habitude tu es venu pour me contredire et tu te plantes lamentablement.

&gt;Loin de la de 2003 a 2012 , 2011 a été la seule année(En partie causé par la crise)) tu ne peux prendre 1 année en donnée statistiques pour conclure que que les résultats ne sont pas vrai

Allez on continue : en 2010, 16,9 milliards reçus pour 18,8 milliards envoyés...

Basé sur aucune source officielle car on n'étudie pas le phénomène. Par contre, les dégradations lors de la dernière coupe du monde, du match France Algérie de 2002, les drapeaux omniprésents, les statistiques officieuses en prison, les terroristes Merah, Nemmouche, ou encore Abdelhakim Dekhar... La liste est longue.

&gt;Certains migrants africains ont autant de problemes que ses communautés et ceux meme si ils n'ont pas de double nationalité

Et alors ? Je n'ai jamais dit que tous les délinquants étaient binationaux.

&gt;Sa reste a avoir le ratio criminel vs nombre de personnes dans la communauté qui ont une double nationalité (Qui je suis sur sur est absolument minime)

Minime est un jugement de valeur sans intérêt. Qui je suis sûr est de l'ordre de 25%, en plus des 19% d'étrangers en prison... On pourrait commencer par regarder dans [la liste des personnes recherchées](http://www.avisderecherches.interieur.gouv.fr/personnes1.asp%3FT%3DR)...

&gt;La majorité d'entre eux sont des expatriés bien établi tout dépendamment du pays, la nationalité francaise sera laissé tombé.

Ça veut dire quoi ""bien établi tout dépendamment du pays"" ? Quelles sont tes sources ?

Dans ce cas là ils sont en rupture avec la France et il n'y a aucune raison qu'ils restent français.

&gt;En conclusion tu ne ma rien démontré. l'interdiction de la double nationalité n'est basé sur rien de rationnelle,les sondages montrent que les immigrés sont toujours attaché a la France autant que ceux qui y ont renoncé crée un faux débat, serait je suis pratiquement sur illégale juridiquement puisque certain français n'auront pas le droit a la naturalisation puisqu'ils viennent d'un pays A mais d'autres y auront droit puisqu'il viennent d'un pays B(Nah lol aucune chance que sa passe).


J'ai réfuté l'ensemble de ces points.

&gt;Tout en sachant que la France n'a aucun controle sur les lois voté dans un pays ni a son registre de citoyen.

Tout en sachant que la France a un contrôle totale sur les naturalisations.

&gt;Notamment l'interdiction a certain citoyen dont le pays ne reconnais pas la la renonciation d’être naturalisé français

You can only pick two of these:

- Decent unemployment benefits / basic income.
- Income jump from unemployed to employed.
- Reasonably taxed middle and upper class.

You can't have basic income higher than todays benefits + higher income jump from unemployed to employed than today + middle and upper class as rich as today. Income redistribution doesn't create wealth. If someone gets richer by x, you have to take x from someone else.

&gt; Just because someone hates what they do, doesn't mean they'd do nothing if they could subsist without working.

Let's say I'm a truck driver and I don't enjoy the job really. I'll rather work as a songwriter. But I can't quit the job, because I need money and nobody wants to employ me as a songwriter. Under basic income, I quit my job and start to write songs that nobody is willing to pay for. I wasn't the only truck driver that quit, most of them did. So the truck company must double the wages to hire more truck drivers. Who will pay the money? Consumers, including me, prices go up, so I barely survive with my basic income, I actually have the same living standards as if I was unemployed before basic income!

Oh please put your accusations and personal attacks back up your arse. Besides as much as I'm not a fan of K. De Gucht at least he does think that the negotiation directives given by the Council should be made public. Oh what's this? Does that conflict with your narrative?

&gt;This isn't the US so if the people want to know what the negotiations are about then tell your employer he should come here and explain why the treaty is beneficial to the EU rather than calling everyone out as scaremongers and idiots.

If you want to talk about how you don't like these negotiations being private then that's a discussion point wholly different from ""ermagerd this and this and this will be in it and it'll be horrible for us all. Trust me I'm a fortune teller. I know what they'll do.""

People are already throwing loads of shit around that would supposedly be in it and brand it as fact. If that's not scaremongering then Idk what is.
I'm fine with discussions on whether it should be private or not but that's not what the article and the absolute majority of discussion on here is about.

Hell, the fucking article starts with: ""there are more and more **indications that** European data protection standards **could be** undermined by such a trade agreement.""

Oh please do tell which pro ACTA arguments I used. Is this your first account? If so then your certainly weren't around when that was discussed here.

Well it does seem like that which is what I'm referring to. /r/europe is glaringly anti TTIP as are you but somehow you manage to turn that around on me? Ha!

I haven't said a thing to support the contents of TTIP because the specific part we're discussing here hasn't even been negotiated and released yet.

&gt;That's how a democracy works, you should learn about it sometime.

Of course but if someone says something that isn't vehemently anti TTIP but rather points out that we're dancing around the illustruous information that hasn't been released yet because that particular negotiation round isn't over....then he's a paid shill or some random involved politician.

It doesn't really matter to me as a private person do they belong to Finland or not. I would still have Finnish passport and I would still not need it when going to Åland. 

What more, I kind of feel that letting Åland go would be really neat. We would also get a new Nordic neighbour with whom we could co-ordinate our laws with (as we currently do with our other former countrymen, Swedes, Norwegians and Danish*). 

That Sweden and Finland found a way to solve the Åland Question (that had been a problem for Sweden the whole 19th century) 100 years ago with meditation from League of Nations is still a very important chapter in how Swedes and Finns see themselves. We didn't start a war, but sat on the same table, came to a conclusion that was acceptable for both and then went on to build a friendship that went far beyond good trade relationship (special considerations for citizens of the other nation above other foreigners, free movement over borders without identification in 1950s etc). It's stuff like that which should make citizens patriotic, not the extend of borders. Having Åland leave on it's own would be a fitting bookend. Not a case of losing, but one of victory.

True. And I do think there should be some more oversight. That's different however from making up possible doom-scenarios and claiming them to be fact if this passes (as people here love to do).

On one hand I'd love if they gave it some more time upon release but on the other hand the public reaction does make me doubt.
The spins given to it are ridiculous and they make it seem like it's even more secretive then it is so let me quote De Gucht to enrage /u/Jan_Brady a bit further.

Though judging from how companies are treated it seems the bigger the invasions of privacy, the less likely companies are to suffer.

We know there are back-doors in Windows that the NSA make Microsoft leave there for later exploitation, but everyone's medical records are probably stored on a windows machine.

We're getting to the point that if your personal information is stored on a windows based system - it is de facto in breach of data protection laws.

Yet here we are discussing more data 'sharing'.

How many elephants does a room need before they're properly discussed?

We should put a halt to these negotiations until encryption standards are enforced in Europe and demonstrated to be NSA &amp; GCHQ proof.

Anything less and the EU is simply white-washing the situation or paying lip-service to the concept of data protection.

De la même manière, on vient souvent me dire qu'il n'y a pas d'immigration massive. Par exemple [ici](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fqvdd/farright_at_gates_of_power_in_france_says_pm_valls/ckc03sj), et [ma réponse n'a pas changé](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fqvdd/farright_at_gates_of_power_in_france_says_pm_valls/ckc8gt2) :

&gt;&gt;But it's not a serious problem, and I still reject that there's mass migration to France.

&gt;As I've said elsewhere, it's a subjective statement, we can agree to disagree on this.

---

&gt;Soit, j'avais pas l'impression que la première vague d'immigration soit toujours pertinente en termes d'effectifs bruts mais si l'idée existe, pourquoi pas.

C'est souvent ce qu'on me répond. Je profite de cet article pour dire que non, la majorité de l'immigration du Maghreb est récente. Je ne connaissais pas le chiffre, je partage l'information.

&gt;C'est aussi vrai pour les immigrés non maghrébins, non ?

Je ne sais pas, les Italiens, Polonais ou Espagnols sont arrivés avant. Les Portugais à cheval entre les deux périodes.

&gt;Pourtant, les immigrés Marocains et Algériens représentent à eux que 22% des immigrés en France

Je trouve pour l'ensemble du Maghreb (Algérie, Maroc et Tunisie) 25,5% en 2007, 28,5% en 2006, contre 20% en 1994, 1995 et 1996. On voit une augmentation de la proportion de maghrébins dans l'immigration. Le reste de l'Afrique a suivi le même chemin puisqu'elle passe de 9% en 1994 à 16% en 2008 dans les flux entrants.

Sur le total, présent en France en 2008, [j'ai autour de 30% pour le Maghreb](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_en_France#Origine_g.C3.A9ographique) et 10% pour le reste de l'Afrique.

&gt;Ton mur de texte, en gros c'est ""l'immigration sert le grand capital"" ? 

C'est une caricature. Je n'ai rien à ajouter ni rien à retrancher à ce que j'ai dit là-bas. Mon commentaire réfute plusieurs poncifs des grands médias sur l'immigration.

&gt;Mais croire que c'est exclusivement à cause de l'immigration, c'est simplifier très, très grandement la situation.

Je ne le fais pas.

&gt;C'est un problème qui a été minutieusement planifié depuis longtemps par la classe dirigeante pour servir leurs propres intérêt, et ça passe par des principes plus directs que l'immigration.

Therefore, if they steal from them then the tourists don't really know who to turn to, and in the rare occasion they do manage to contact the police to report a crime they don't stick long enough to help with the investigation, let alone serve as witnesses in the trial.

So, even on an election specifically about Europe (with no effect on who actually governs you), where only the people who actually give a toss about Europe bother to show up, they still only got a little more than a quarter of the vote (27.5%), and with all the anti-EU parties added together, still under a third.

The UK has also managed to retain more control over its affairs than most European countries, people are pretty happy with the Euro and Schengen opt-outs, and there seems to be no threat to what's left of the rebate (unless the UK were to exit and later re-negotiate entry).

This news roundup is definitely my favourite thing on reddit so I thought I’d contribute, hope a couple of you find it mildly interesting. Anyway whilst I wait for the Russian guy to post, here is the first Jersey weekly news roundup:

* With Jersey’s second ever general election coming up in less than a month’s time, one third of the seats in the States have already been elected unopposed including 11 of the 12 constables (we’re pretty good at political apathy like 60% registered, 26% turnout.) [Link]( http://www.bailiwickexpress.com/jsy/news/democracy-loses-third-politicians-slip-uncontested/#.VB7KIfldWSo)
* Also bundled in the general election is a referendum to remove constables from their States positions (voted as heads of parishes but are also given a States seat giving rural parishes large overrepresentation) a couple of campaign groups have only now been quickly set up.

* A Jerseyman and a woman from England were brutally murdered in Thailand. A difficult investigation is ongoing with two originally suspected Jerseymen cleared. [Link](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29277280)

true,chipswithcheese,null,null,"You're completely correct is calling għ a single letter (although it's made out of 2 characters - go figure).  This letter is called the għajn (pronounced ayn ('a' as in art).  It has no sound of it's own, but lengthens the vowel in that syllable.  So in **tagħmel** _[you do]_ the 'a' is lengthened (so, again like the _a_ in art) and it's pronounce ta-mel (with that long, open 'a' like when you say 'aaah').  It's much like the silent _h_

It's quite important for funny grammatical reasons I studied too long ago to recall.  Basically it contributes to the ""root"" of the verb.  

So, the ""basic form"" of tagħmel, is għamel _[to do]_.  That gives you a three letter root of għ - m - l (you only use consonants; in Maltese vowel don't mean a huge deal usually).  Because you know the root, you then  know what rules to use to mix and mash it into any of the applicable ""forms of the verb"". All three letters from this root will be present in any form that the verb takes.  This includes other funny constructs like verbal nouns etc.  For example magħmul (""done"" (as a noun though)) again has the għ-m-l with a preceding 'm' making it a verbal noun.",0,1411305593,null,0,false,0,ckocwbl,t3_2gxzzu,t1_ckocwbl,t1_cko9kf2,null,1426895447,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Thousands of these homes were bought by British expats(other expats collectives like the Germans have had only some isolated cases), the majority bought by Spaniards of course. 

Let's go now to 2012: the PSOE that tolerated all that illegal construction loses the absolute majority in the regional elections but can rule in a coalition with the IU(United Left). And this left have been saying that one of the reasons that we are in this situation is the tolerance with the illegal construction. 

And the new coalition government started a policy of zero tolerance with illegal housing, and started judicial procedures for demolishing many of the houses. There were also procedures that allowed legalization in many cases(not natural park, not protected beach or similar) paying very big fines, some homes even got demolished actually.  Brits have been trying to get amnesty refusing any deal that meant recognizing any illegal action in their side(we were good will customers and so on). 


And probably almost everybody is going to end having an amnesty. There was one already for big developments already.  The British government, or embassy at least,  fought really hard for the legalization of this illegal houses: went to the EU parliament,  threatened with trying to get an international investigation about what has been going on Spanish real estate...

Et ce même à caractéristiques sociales et familiales semblables.

Et on peut continuer : les Turcs maintiennent bien plus leur langue d’origine que les immigrés d’autres origines. Ainsi, 8 % des personnes nées en France d’au moins un parent turc parlent uniquement français à la maison, un taux bien en-deçà du second taux le plus bas, celui des enfants de Marocains et Tunisiens (29 %).

It's probably historic because for so long, Malta was under the administration of a religious order and because it was one of the places at which the Ottoman Empire tried to move into Europe.  This made it a ""bastion of christianity"".  The Enlightenment largely passed us by, because when Napoleon arrived in 1798, and tried to change a lot of stuff.  Malta doesn't like change, so we then asked the British Empire to administer the country and they did less to antagonise the Church.  The result is that the Church retained a lot of power in Malta.  The constitution even names the Roman Catholic faith as the official faith of the country.

/u/SpectreOfMalta is getting a little bit carried away, however, as by the time the Age of Enlightenment came around, things were already pretty from the ""Christian State militia"" level. 

In reality, the situation is no worse than, say Ireland or Poland.  In Malta, for example abortion is illegal and only allowed if the mother's life is at risk.  The law is more liberal than Ireland's until at least very recently.  

On a side-note it gets really fucking surreal when a bearded guy (me) is vociferously defending women's rights, against women arguing against their right to choose.  It's really fucking odd.  Those who support a woman's right to choice are a stark minority.  In fact, I'd be honestly surprised if /u/SpectreOfMalta was not anti-abortion despite his looking down on people with staunch religious beliefs.  _I'm using /u/SpectreOfMalta as an example of a common situation, I really don't know what he thinks on the subject and hope he doesn't take offence_.

I recently ordered something online from Greece. They claimed I could play cash on delivery as it was through a courier that both countries have (ACS) -- an option given to me after selecting ""Cyprus"" from a list, and they charged me an additional 3 euros because of C.O.D. In the end, they called and asked to have the money bank transferred instead, plus a little more ""because this delivery option is not available"" (+5 euros i believe, ontop of charging the 3 euros that wasn't going to be used for 'c.o.d.' anymore). As this was some very specialized things for my brother-in-law which are difficult to find elsewhere, I had to go ahead with the purchase. They were some specific small statues that he wanted for his gf. I ended up paying about 10 euros more than the receipt online suggested. **So far so good.**

The package arrives.. in several bags inside each other, and the walls of the bags filled with paint and warnings everywhere ""WARNING: Paint!"". Somewhere in the bottom of all that mess there was a box with the small statues, and a receipt inside from a ""book shop"" (The business I was ordering from what is no way a book shop and the names did not match), with yet a lower amount than even the online receipt suggested, charged at the lowest VAT rate as it's ""books"" (I think 5%?). One of those old-school receipts you get from the corner shop that aren't specific about anything. FFS, It probably isn't *that* widespread, but *seriously*.. wtf...?

It was extremely difficult to go through with this purchase.. I've ordered stuff online from many countries including UK, Germany, Ireland, Spain, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Romania.. never ever had issues and everything was very straight-forward.. the only thing this Greek business had going for it was that I had to purchase *exactly* what my brother-in-law wanted which was from this shop. I do not think any sane human being would have finished checking out his cart from this greek ""online shop"".

Per quanto riguarda i miei sospetti su di me:
- discalculia: accentuato dal fatto che la matematica mi è sempre interessata. A scuola ero spesso il primo a risolvere i problemi matematici, perché ci voleva ragionamento per trovare la soluzione, però durante i compiti in classe, mettevano i problemi che avevamo già risolto in classe, ma con numeri diversi, e là ero il più lento a finirli, e spesso finivo per consegnare il compito senza aver cominciato alcuni esercizi. 


- disgrafia: sono sempre stato lento a scrivere. Non ai livelli dell'OP, ma ci metto il doppio rispetto a una persona normale. mi capita raramente di scrivere una parola per un'altra. Il problema è che faccio casino con le ultime vocale delle parole (tipo qua): metto la vocale della parola prima, ma devono essere parole legate sintatticamente come nome-aggettivo, copoula-aggettivo.

- disprassia: questo non è menzionato dall'OP. Una volta quando sono stato a Londra per un corso di inglese, ci hanno fatto fare un test per decidere in che livello inserirci. Un esercizio del test chiedeva di mettere in ordine un testo argomentativo, un altro di scegliere un titolo tra vari opzioni per vari testi.
Bene, in questi esercizi sono stato un disastro, e ho dovuto fare un corso con gente che non capiva perché in alcune domande si diceva ""do you"" e in altre ""are you"".

Ah, poi ho problemi a capire indicazioni vocali, ""in fondo, la seconda, a sinistra, la prima"". Però dopo aver visto una mappa, mi oriento benissimo, o anche se mi danno le indicazioni del tipo ""cammina fino a quando non si può andare dritto.

Viel zu oft wird die EU als Instrument missbraucht um missliebige Gesetze durchzudrücken und die Schuld im Zweifelsfall auf die EU schieben zu können (siehe Vorratsdatenspeicherung). Allerdings ist da eine AfD nicht die Lösung.

- Was das Programm angeht, so sammelt es einfach alles was rechts von der CDU liegt und noch nicht offen neonazistisch ist ein. Genau an diesem übelsten Stammtischmilieu werden die Wähler abgefischt. Ob es nun nationalkonservative Ideen sind, Rassismus oder auch nur evangelikale Familienpolitik ist dabei egal. Lustiges Spielzeug: [AFD oder NPD](http://www.afdodernpd.de)

- Wähler reihen sich da entsprechend ein, wobei man noch einen großen Teil den Verschwörungstheoretikern zugestehen muss. Wer will suche mal in den sozialen Netzwerken umher oder schaue sich http://afdwaehlerstellensichvor.tumblr.com/ an.

- Funktionäre: Bei mir im **Kaff** (Münster) wurde die AfD mit 2 Sitzen in den Rat gewählt. Einer von beiden Abgeordneten (der ehemalige Sprecher) ist mittlerweile aus der AfD ausgetreten. Er hatte die örtliche AfD-Position bezogen, das der Bau von dringend benötigten Kitas verfassungswidrig sei (Kinder gehören ausschließlich zur Hausfrau&amp;Mutter). Nachdem er nach dem Shitstorm abbekommen hat und durch die AfD Rückendeckung verweigert wurde ist er mit dem Hinweis darauf ausgetreten und wegen den ""stärker werdenden rechten und nationalen Strömungen innerhalb der AfD."". Damit hat die AfD nach 4 Monaten 'erfolgreicher' Ratsarbeit schon direkt den Fraktionsstatus wieder verloren. Im Vorfeld hat die AfD schon im Wahlkampf Wellen geschlagen, als sie eine Schlägertruppe zum ""Schutz"" ihres Infostandes angeheuert hatte. Diese hatte dann Journalisten sowie Protestierende die 50 Meter weiter Flugblätter verteilt hatten bedroht und z.T. angegriffen. Örtliche Neonazikader haben die Schlägertruppe dabei auch besucht und mit Handschlag begrüßt. Im **regionalen Bereich** ist es mit den Parteifunktionären auch nicht besser bestellt. Dort befinden massenhaft Republikaner,Pro-NRW u.ä. die auf der Suche nach einer neuen Rechtsaussen-Kraft die AfD unterstützen und dort mit offenen Armen empfangen wurden. So ist beispielsweise der OV-Essen genau der ehemalige OV-Republikaner Essen. Genauso haben sie keine Probleme mal eine Schußwaffe gegen Gegner zu ziehen. Dann wäre da der **Landesvorstand**. So Leute wie Herrmann Behrendt, die gerne den Bundestag abschaffen würden und stattdessen lieber eine diktatorische Bundesregierung hätten. Auf **Bundesebene** sieht das dann auch nicht besser aus. Siehe Konrad Adam, der gerne dafür plädiert das allgemeine Wahlrecht abzuschaffen und Arbeitslose sowie sonstige Nettoempfängern vom politischen Mitspracherecht auszuschließen. Oder Gestalten wie Beatrix von Storch, eine erzkonservative christliche Lobbyisten, deren ganze Lebensgeschichte daraus bestand ein obskures Geflecht aus Lobbyistenverbände aufzubauen.

**This situation** derived from the construction madness:

* 25% of unemployment classic.
* 3.5 millions of empty/closed houses that nobody uses for living or second residences.
* 25% of of the economy was construction and auxiliary sectors. That disappeared and has left a big hole in our economy that partially explains the first point.
* Massive private debt.
* Many sparsely populated new developments that more to public administrations than the taxes that they generate.
* 3 millions of long term jobless many of them unskilled construction workers.
* The rule of law is seen as a not funny joke... A construction company can build a golf course with 200 homes in a natural park and the justice will say that is illegal 7 years after is finished.

&gt; what incentive does the IU have to crack down on this illegal practice now?

They are supposed to be a left wing party that push the defense of the environment, publicly controlled urban development, the law is the same for everybody... Real incentives? Good question, after all these years of rampant disregard of the law seeing the guy that built a ghost airport and claims that won the lottery 8 times free, it looks like going for the small guy. And like with communism everybody defends the rule of the law for the others, not for themselves and many people has a relative or a friend that owns an illegal house. However, during the campaign looked good.

My *prediction*, they will accept the amnesty that the PSOE has announced with some minor modifications.

&gt; 

No, that is my ""rhetoric"". In reality, nothing close to that scenario would have happened.

&gt; Not if they wanted to:
Join the EU
Keep their financial sector
Have any meaningful degree of macro security

It is in EU's nature to discourage ongoing independence movements, but once the thing is over and done with, they would not impede Scotland from joining. It's ridiculous to even consider that.

A suitable arrangement would have been found for the currency issue, in negotiation with UK and afterwards the EU. These are not the issues that Scotland could ever decide on unilaterally anyway - admittedly it was a mistake made by the Yes campaign to imply that they could. 

If anything, the problems with the Yes campaign were due to the nature of how the referendum was staged. The Scottish Parliament could not have negotiated with UK and EU on these issues from a position of sovereign authority BEFORE the the referendum, only AFTER the independence option won. 

The only thing that Yes campaign could have done is propose the **possible** currency options. That is what they should have done, and that is what they should have stuck with. Yes, that would leave space for fear and doubt, but at least they couldn't be called out for deciding something Scotland could not unilaterally decide on, and they wouldn't have to try to publicly blackmail Westminster into the currency union. That was their mistake.

However, the currency issue WAS abused, and boy was it abused hard. Both UK and many EU countries had a vested interest in the referendum failing, and have actively done their part to push the outcome towards No. For better or worse, this is a legitimate thing to do in politics - you manipulate the public view to get what you want, and that is what they did.

The moment Scotland became an independent country, that attitude would have changed from an obstructive and intimidating one into a cooperative one in a blink of an eye. Why? Because that happened in every other recorded case of independence being voted for and declared, and because nobody would have an interest in **intentionally** disrupting Scotland once they become independent. And as long as there is no one intentionally standing in the way, a proper arrangement would have been found during the negotiations that followed.

Everyone is working with fucking Kosovo to make them a functional country. To think that one of the wealthiest, safest and most democratic nations in the world would somehow be stuck or impeded takes a special kind of crazy or naive (or well, a barrage of media fearmongering as it turns out). If there ever was a country in the world that has every reason to feel safe about declaring independence, it's Scotland.",0,1411309692,null,0,1411312339,0,ckoe9i1,t3_2h0t0s,t1_ckoe9i1,t1_ckodnen,null,1426894810,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

At a small extend, yes. People facing certain difficulties like being disable need specific treatment, OK. But at the end of the day, everyone needs a minimum level of income in order to survive and participate in life and society. We propose to assume everyone needs a basic income.

Seriously the current tax-benefit system is currently using billions of euros/dollars, for what? For a society where poverty is still growing? Let's face it: we can do much simpler, much more efficient with UBI. 

&gt;People who don't work get benefits today.

Not all of them. The system is so complex many people do not get because of means test, conditions, etc. Also, there are so many benefits systems in France that it's almost impossible to know all of them. There are studies that show a non take up ratio of more than 50% on some benefits. Plus, the UBI is not just for the unemployed, it's for everyone, especially the working poors.

More generally, I think you miss the point of UBI which is not to promise people they will get 'more money than today'. This is really not the idea. The point is about disconnecting jobs and income, thereby giving more equal opportunities to all, changing our conception of 'work', and most of all providing basic psychologic security to all.

Gesetze der Kommission kann das EU-Parlament blockieren. Der Rest der EU ist ein internationales Gebilde, da hier Regierungschefs oder Minister der Mitgliedsländer zusammenkommen.

Inwiefern? Ist dir bewusst wie, beziehungsweise wo sich Demokratiedefizite der EU äußern?

Die Bürokratie der gesamten EU kostet weniger als die Administration von London.

&gt;Einheitliche Standards machen nur Sinn, wenn die Voraussetzungen ähnlich sind.

Welche Voraussetzungen müssen denn gleich sein? Kannst du derartige Floskeln mal spezifizieren?

&gt;Wieso nicht eine einheitliche Wirtschafts-, Finanz-, Umweltpolitik für ganz Europa?

Umweltpolitik machen wir doch schon gemeinsam, einheitliche und hohe Umweltstandards wären ne richtig saubere Sache. Finanzpolitik arbeiten wir doch auch eng zusammen. Wobei wir übrigens beim Punkt wären:

Es geht nicht um Vereinheitlichung und Zentralisierung, sondern Zusammenarbeit. Wenn du dir die EU anschaust wirst du internationale und supranationale Komponenten erkennen.

Treffenderweise kritisiert du gleichzeitig die Schwäche des EU-Parlaments als supranationales, tendenziell zentralistisches Organ - und damit das Demokratiedefizit- und die Zentralisierung der EU, ohne Verweise auf die Machtschwerpunkte der internationalen Organe der EU: EU-Rat, Ministerrat, EU-Kommission als Hybrid aus Supranationalismus und Internationalismus und Ausschuss der Regionen.

The only thing I don't like is that Netflix doesn't let you preload movies on iOS like BBC iPlayer does. Also, some settings aren't available from the app, only from the web page, but it's no big deal. I do like that you can have different profiles, this way my wife and I can use the same account but have our own separate watch lists etc.

As far as content goes, it's a lot less that I would have wanted. Many films I looked for aren't available (nb: I'm not up to date, so I was looking for movies from the last twenty years or so, not brand new ones). A lot of the *movies* that are available are bottom tier trash. I sometimes honestly have an easier time finding something to watch in KIDS mode... The only reason I'm still willing to pay for it is that I'm so far behind with movies and TV series that there's still enough that's new to me anyway. (We don't watch TV and no time to go to the cinema in the last few years...)

However, Netflix also gets a big plus from me for content because almost everything I tried so far was available with original language audio. I prefer to listen to the original audio if I understand the language, so I'm much happier with Netflix than with  Amazon, which only has a tiny number of movies with original audio and they have their own separate entries that you need to search separately by looking for names that contain OV (""Originalversion"") or OMU (""Original mit Untertiteln""). In contrast, Netflix just lets you switch audio tracks during playback and even lets you choose a preferred language that it will default to. But it's not perfect either: It still shows the German video track, so subtitles can be a little annoying sometimes.

And that is exactly what would happen.

I get it that it is not a convincing POLITICAL argument, and that it can be exploited and abused by the other side. But it is what it is. Again, due to the nature of the referendum, there is nothing anyone could have done to avoid that. 

Yes campaign simply had to find a way to win in spite of that, rather than be bullied into addressing the issue in more depth than they had a rational way to do, and then having to eat their words when they fell for it.

The reason currency issue was such a focal point of the campaign is because the No campaign KNEW that there is nothing conclusive Yes campaign could possibly do or say, because that is the nature of the issue. So they pressed it to score political points. And they won. That's all. Of course all the advertised apocalyptic scenarios were retarded. 

&gt; Sure, and that ""proper arrangement"" might not involve an opt-out from the Euro. Or it might involve a lengthy transition period. Or it might not happen at all, if certain EU members don't want to set a precendent of seceded states being welcomes back into the EU.

Only the Euro opt-out may have been problematic, but probably not unavoidable. Scotland would also have been fine with the Euro, and no lengthy transitional period would be enforced.

As for the last thing, I stand by the fact that while EU is happy to bully and intimidate independence movements, nobody benefits from obstructing them once independence has been declared. At that point, there is no going back, and there is no need to create unnecessary social and economic tensions in the region.

Aber die Vernetzung von (Alpha-)Journalisten und der Elite hat doch ein bedenkliches Ausmaß angenommen. Es gibt für mich heute keine Zeitung mehr, der ich vertraue. Tagesspiegel finde ich ganz gut, ich bevorzuge Heute-Nachrichten vor der Tagesschau, aber ich habe keine positive Beziehung zu einer Zeitung oder einer Nachrichtensendung. Man muss sich seine Informationen selbst zusammensuchen. Die Journalisten haben nach meinem Gefühl aufgehört, einfach nur über die Dinge zu berichten und begonnen, selbst Politik zu machen.

Quand on a beaucoup de français qui maîtrisent l'arabe et la culture musulmane, on a de facto de l'influence. Après, de là à dire qu'on l'exploite correctement, je dis pas, mais la France est quand même un pays qui historiquement a une grande influence en Afrique, c'est un fait.

Sinon je vois pas l'intérêt d'essayer d'expliquer quel intérêt on peut avoir à avoir de l'influence quelque part dans le monde, tu es suffisamment intelligent pour savoir qu'il y en a un.

&gt;Pour avoir de l'influence, il faut une France en bonne santé économique et soudée, pas une France divisée avec en particulier des immigrés qui veulent prendre leur revanche sur l'ancien colonisateur.

Vrai. D'où l'intérêt de consciencieusement chier sur tous les français (quelque soit leur origine ethnique) qui participent à dé-souder les communauté ethniques qui y vivent. Et quand tu dis que la culture musulmane en France est un ""problème"", tu y participes autant que l'abruti qui veut ""prendre sa revanche"" sur la France.

&gt;En particulier, à partir du moment où l'immigration appauvrit économiquement la France, on se doit d'arrêter d'accepter sur notre territoire des personnes qui lui coûtent.

Des chiffres ?

&gt;Au contraire. En affirmant clairement qu'être un Français est un honneur, on grandit la France et son image dans le monde.

Tu passes ton temps à dire que la France va mal, qu'elle est en pleine ""crise identitaire"", qu'elle subit un ""effondrement de sa civilisation"". D'où tu affirmes dans ton discours qu'être un Français est un honneur ? Affirmer qu'être français est un honneur, c'est assumer son passé colonial, sa population diverse, et cela même quand cette population a une religion qui ne plaît pas à l'impérialisme américain.

&gt;C'est l'inverse. Il s'agit d'arrêter avec la repentance et de dire que la France est une force sur laquelle ces pays peuvent s'appuyer au lieu de toujours se rabaisser.

Hein ? Où tu vois de la repentance dans mon discours ? Où je nous rabaisse ? Ce sont les militants du FN qui rabaissent sans arrêt la France en essayant d'expliquer au monde entier combien ils ont honte d'être ce qu'ils sont : une ex super puissance coloniale, qui de fait en fait un pays occidental plus riche culturellement que les autres.

&gt; 

Sure you could. Some would turn out to be right, some would turn out to be wrong. This one would turn out to be right.

There is no need to trust anyone in particular, just understand how the process works and the interests of participants involved (post-independence).

&gt; Unless you wanted to discourage future independence bids.

They could also discourage independence bids by rolling in the tanks and arresting leaders. I believe Spain even has the legal right to do this. 

In reality, it won't be done, because it is a political suicide - as obstructing Scotland would be (obviously to a somewhat lesser extent). It would only galvanize the independence movements further, and would be pretty unpopular with the public.

Europe has a policy of not escalating matters, especially once the dust settles, decisions have already been made, and there is no going back. Europe should also have learned that there is no real way to block independence movements once they reach a critical mass.

Look at how Montenegro solved the currency issue - by saying ""yeah we're just going to take the Euro because we feel like it"".

Unterstützung von Flüchtlingen besteht aus Sozialleistungen. Wer für schnellere Asylverfahren ist - und damit für geringere verursachte Kosten, ist nicht automatisch Nazi. Wer Flüchtlinge auch wirtschaftlich integrieren will, etwa durch Jobs, damit sie keine Sozialleistungen erhalten, ist auch nicht unbedingt Nazi. 

&gt; Und eine Scheindemokratie? Wie definierst du das bitte?

Gewählt wird eine Auswahl von Kandidaten, du hast keine Möglichkeit die Personas der Kandidaten, die zur Wahl stehen, zu beeinflussen. Danach hast du für vier Jahre die Klappe zu halten, denn ab sofort entscheiden diese Repräsentanten, was gut ist - laut Grundgesetz ""ihrem eigenen Gewissen verpflichtet"", in der Realität aber auf Parteilinie, denn wenn sie es nicht tun, werden sie nicht wieder aufgestellt.

Das ist dann keine Herrschaft des Volkes, ausgeübt durch demokratisch legitimierte Vertreter (= die offizielle Definition, die man schulisch vermittelt bekommt), sondern eine Oligarchie (im Sinne von ""Herrschaft Weniger"", nicht im Sinne des russischen Oligarchen), deren Mitglieder mehr oder weniger demokratisch festgelegt werden.

Wenn man etwas daran ändern wollte, würde man synkratische Elemente einführen, man hätte term limits für besonders einflussreiche Posten, um Berufspolitiker zu vermeiden, und Positionen auf Ministerialebene dürften nicht willkürlich durch einen Regierungschef vergeben werden, sondern müssten vom Parlament genehmigt werden. Außerdem täte es uns gut, wenn der Bundestag alle zwei Jahre zur Hälfte zur Wahl stände - ähnlich den Midterms in den USA. Das würde Bewegung ins Parlament bringen. Ich bin auch für eine Finanzierung von Abgeordnetenwahlkämpfen durch private Bürger - einfach, um einen ""falschen"", von der Bevölkerung eigentlich ungeliebten Kandidaten der vorherrschenden Partei nicht zu bevorteilen.

But there was no Belgium yet, merely a bunch of medieval fiefs together by chance. The region was called the Southern- or Spanish- and later Austrian-Netherlands.

D'une part je ne vois pas le rapport. As-tu des données pour appuyer cela ?

&gt;la France est quand même un pays qui historiquement a une grande influence en Afrique, c'est un fait

Bien sûr mais ça n'a rien à voir avec le fait d'accepter de laisser rentrer toujours plus d'immigrés qu'on n'a pas les moyens d'accueillir.

&gt;Vrai. D'où l'intérêt de consciencieusement chier sur tous les français (quelque soit leur origine ethnique) qui participent à dé-souder les communauté ethniques qui y vivent.

 On peut intégrer une grande partie de ceux qui sont là, mais pour cela il faudra jusqu'à ce qu'on aille mieux économiquement arrêter les flux nouveaux. En attendant on crée toujours plus de pauvres non éduqués.

&gt;Et quand tu dis que la culture musulmane en France est un ""problème"", tu y participes autant que l'abruti qui veut ""prendre sa revanche"" sur la France.

Je n'ai pas dit cela. Par contre je ne vois pas en quoi l'islam est une chance pour la France, ni en quoi le fait d'être le premier pays musulman est une chance pour la France.

&gt;Tu passes ton temps à dire que la France va mal, qu'elle est en pleine ""crise identitaire"", qu'elle subit un ""effondrement de sa civilisation"".

Je n'ai jamais parlé de crise identitaire ni effondrement de la civilisation française.

&gt;D'où tu affirmes dans ton discours qu'être un Français est un honneur ?

Regarde la situation en Algérie ou ailleurs en Afrique. 

On est la 5ème puissance économique mondiale. On est leaders dans le nucléaire, le tourisme, le luxe, on est la seconde puissance maritime mondiale derrière les États-Unis.

&gt;Affirmer qu'être français est un honneur, c'est assumer son passé colonial, sa population diverse, et cela même quand cette population a une religion qui ne plaît pas à l'impérialisme américain.

Mais à nouveau cette religion n'est absolument pas un atout.

&gt;Où tu vois de la repentance dans mon discours ? Où je nous rabaisse ? 

Je faisais référence à l'interview de Plenel, qui a affirmé ""La présence des musulmans en France est le résultat de notre projection, car nous nous sommes invités chez eux sans demander l’autorisation.""

There is nothing wrong with my comments. I simply said that I thought it didn't look like Europe, and then recalled that in my experience I've never seen palm trees whenever I did visit the Mediterranean.

And before you're going to say: 

&gt; You didn't say you 'thought' it, you said it as if it were a fact, as an absolute statement.

Welcome to the English language (Or natural human language in general), where a statement without the words 'I think' aren't necessarily indicative of an absolute statement. I said that it 'doesn't look' like Europe. That means that it could be Europe, but I'm not sure. Nor am I saying that I am absolutely right about no palm trees in Europe,  I am saying that I am guessing (Guessing) it isn't Europe, and I am guessing that because I've never seen palm trees whenever I visited it.

I never said that the above picture can't be Europe and I never claimed that there are no palm trees near the Mediterranean and I am not saying that no palm trees means this can't be Europe.

Maybe you shouldn't read comments then, since you can't interpret them.

Because let's look at the last two comments:

Me:

&gt; I've been to the Mediterranean like 5 times in all my life. Plural does not mean 'all'. Just like saying 'I have 5 Euro's' doesn't mean I've got all the Euro's.

You:

&gt; Then you shouldn't be posting comments like that

So basically,what you're saying is that I shouldn't post comments with plurals, because people like you might think I'm saying that I'm speaking in absolutes.

Is that true? No, you were referring to my first comment. This is the weird thing with language, it's not always literal and it's not always in chronological order. 

Instead of taking all my comments literally, try to read them like a human being that is able to understand figurative language. ",0,1411315303,null,0,1411315494,0,ckogno9,t3_2gzdd3,t1_ckogno9,t1_ckogfwa,null,1426893693,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

It looks like everyone just woke up. Finally, most of the fashion trends in the US seem to be about 10+ years behind most of Europe.

I joke with my parents when they're over that you can spot Americans from all the way down the street based on what they're wearing. You see an older guy especially walking towards you [like this](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7s50pMWN61qjuf7f.jpg)?

&gt;Das Konzept der Freiheit, ist Sache der Erziehung.

Das westliche Modell ist **kein** auferzogenes oder willkürliches **persönliches** Wertemodell.

Es ist der **gesellschaftliche** Minimalkompromiss um einer modernen und auch heterogenen Gesellschaft ein Zusammenleben ohne größere und mit weniger ethnischen und kriegerischen Umwälzungen zu ermöglichen. Reformismus, Gleichheit und gewaltfreier Dialog treten an die Stelle von Gruppenkonflikten.

Es geht genau darum, dass jeder leben kann wie er will. Der liberale Staat ist neutral. Wenn jemand nicht frei sein will, zb aus religiösen Gründen, so kann er dies tun. In Deutschland wie in Amerika. Der liberale Staat greif im Idealfall nicht in das persönliche Leben ein.

&gt;In anderen Kulturkreisen, gibt es vom eurozentristischen Freiheitsmodel abweichende Ansichten wie Freiheit definiert werden soll.

Na dann mal her damit. Was sind das für abweichende Definitionen von Freiheit und Menschenrechten sind? Freiheit ist Freiheit. Was von der Definition von Freiheit abweicht ist keine Freiheit sondern etwas anderes. Meistens Unfreiheit.

Dann definieren andere Gesellschaften also Unfreiheit als gesellschaftlichen Standard. Wohin das führt, sehen wir ja jeden Tag.

Und da sind wir am Punkt. Wenn eine Kultur Unfreiheit praktiziert und damit insofern scheitert, als dich fortwährende multiethnische Konflikte das gesellschaftliche Zusammenleben prägen, ist es dann arrogant oder kulturchauvinistisch zu vertreten, dass das westliche Modell effizienter und menschenfreundlicher ist, da im Westen kein Leben an sich vernichtet wird?

Ich bin der Ansicht, dass ein Gesellschaftsmodell ultimativ dann scheitert, wenn es Leben - in dem Fall also sich selber- auslöscht. Denn wenn das Leben reduziert oder ausgelöscht wird, gibt es nichts mehr, was das Modell regeln kann und es hat sich selber zerstört. Das kann nich der Sinn sein. Egal wie sinnfrei und wertneutral man die Welt sieht - Selbstzerstörung mit anschließendem lebensfreien Raum ist imho das Allersinnloseste was ein Lebewesen und sein Modell tun kann.


&gt;Das kann man akzeptieren, oder auch nicht. Aber eine ""meine- Weltanschauung-ist-die-beste""-Attitüde finde ich persönlich einfach nur arrogant.

Wenn Ich sage ""Das westliche Modell ist besser als Nationalsozialismus"", bin ich dann Kulturchauvinist?

Ich glaube du hast einfach nicht verstanden, wohin Totalistarismus führt, und wieso der westliche Liberalismus als dessen Antithese mehr Erfolg als Gesellschaftsmodell hat.

true,serpenta,POLA,Mazovia,"Yeah, I read it in Timothy Snyders' *Bloodlands. Europe between Hitler and Stalin.* It was a result of Stalin's delusional denial of the humanitarian disaster that the collectivisation of the Ukrainian agriculture really was. I'll try to translate some:

""In his interpretation of the catastrophy the collectivisation was in the last weeks of 1932, Stalin has achieved absolute heights of ideological courage. The Ukrainian famine, which he believed to be a fact, when it was much less drastic, became a ""fairy tale"", a damaging gossip that was being told by the enemies. He has drawn an interesting theory: the opposition against socialism intensifies the greater are the latter's achievements, because the enemies become more and more desperate, as they can see their final defeat. That way every issue inside USSR could have been pictured as enemy's activity, which in turn could have been pointed as a proof of progress being made.

Stalin argued that the resistance in Ukraine is of particular character, which can be easily overlooked. There was no open opposition, the enemies of the socialism were ""quiet"" and even ""saintly"". ""Contemporary kulaks* - he argued - are mostly calm, polite, almost saint"". People that appeared as innocent should have been regarded as guilty. A peasant, slowly dying of hunger was in fact a saboteur, a cogwheel in capitalist campaign aimed at discrediting USSR. Famine was in fact a resistance, and the resistance was a sign that the victory over capitalism is near. These were not only Stalin's deliberations. The same ideological line was being forced by Molotov and Kaganovitch, who were touring the areas of mass deaths in 1932.

Stalin never actually have seen deaths caused by hunger, these were however witnessed by his comrades in Soviet Ukraine, who had to remove somehow the discrepancy between the political line and the reality of their senses. The were forced to explain inflated bellies with political resistance, and so they have come to a conclusion that the saboteurs had to hate socialism so much that they purposefully allowed their families to die off famine. By this logic the bodies of sons, daughters, fathers and mothers became merely a facade behind which their adversaries were ploting to destroy socialism. Even the parishing themselves were sometimes pictured as enemy propagandists bringing into life purposeful plan of undermining socialism. The communist Ukrainian youth from cities was being thought that the hungry are enemies of the people ""risking lives to undermine our optimism"".""

The translation is not very good, but it should only convince you to pick up the book yourself. It's very well written (depending on the translation :P) and it's a smooth read, which contrasts with the topic and shocks the more. I also like it because the author never uses figures to describe the size of killings, but instead he shows the most accurate number of individuals that lost their lives as a result of oppression, which makes it much more personal. He also states this verbatum as his mission, so we never forget that these were unimaginably many individuals that were killed by both nazis and communists, and not magnitude scales or numbers.

Brügge, Dünkirchen, Sangatte, Boulogne, Hardelot, Le Toquet-Paris, Berck, Cayeux, Dieppe (So wie Aussichtspunkte zum pennen an den beiden nahen Atomkraftwerken), Fècamp, Le Havre und anschließend Paris, bevor es nach 8 Tagen dann wieder richtung Heimat ging, was ca. auf die selbe Strecke hinauslief.


In Paris noch kurz die Freundin eingesammelt und 'ne ""Wochenendwohnung"" bei einem Urlaubsbekannten in Montmartre klargemacht, was ziemlich sexy klingt. Selbst Google Maps sagt mir, dass es eine schnuckelige, kleine Wohnung ist mit mehr als genug Platz für Gastgeber, sowie 2 Gäste.


Jetzt heißt es weiter, sich für Übersetzerjobs zu bewerben(Freelance), sowie Bewerbungen über Bewerbungen schreiben für jeglichen Job, der mir ansatzweise gefällt und nach 2 wunderschönen Wochen voller gutem Wetter und Aussicht wieder in Duisburg rumzuwandern.

So, as you can imagine, not only are a lot of events and personalities presented in a false or distorted way to fit the nationalist agenda of the last 50 years, but what bothers me just as much is that we were taught close to nothing about Transylvania. Why? Well, probably because the imbeciles decide what kids should be taught believe that since the region wasn't ruled by Romanian voivodes (well there was John Hunyadi that was of Vlach (Romanian) ancestry and probably some others, just like there were countless nobles throughout Transylvania that were Vlachs, contrary to what we are led to believe, i.e. that Romanians were always persecuted) we shouldn't learn about it very much. Of course, this leads to a lot of ignorance among people that end up believing that there've always been ethnic tensions between Romanians and Hungarians, among other absurdities. 

Generally, one of the most common errors that persist in the history program is the projection of current problems and ideals in the past: for example, many believe that Michael the Brave united the Romanian principalities driven by nationalist fervour and was aiming for ""national unity"". Keep in mind that all this happened around 1600, when there was no such thing as nationalism. Other aspects of the history of the Romanian Principalities that are left out of the books include the recurrent conflicts that existed between Wallachia and Moldavia; sometimes they even allied with Szeklers or Hungarians to fight off each other.",0,1411317026,null,0,1411318119,0,ckohd8w,t3_2h1d4k,t1_ckohd8w,t3_2h1d4k,null,1426893350,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Peu importe. Il est aussi faux de dire « les Américains ont libéré Paris » que de dire « les Français on débarqué en Normandie » (sur ce dernier point d'ailleurs, si les Alliés l'avaient bien voulu, la contribution française aurait pu être plus conséquente). Pourquoi n'avoir pas mentionné, tout simplement, le débarquement en Normandie et la campagne de Normandie, contributions majeures des Alliés sur le sol français ?

&gt; En plus, le fait que l'armée française ait donné l'air de libérer Paris seule, c'était volontaire, les américains n'y sont pas allés de suite pour montrer que c'était la France qui se libérait toute seule. 

Pas exactement. Il était hors de question tout d'abord pour l'État-major allié de libérer Paris aussi vite – historiquement, ça s'est déroulé fin août, le plan initial pour la libération mentionnait fin octobre. Si les objectifs du plan initial étaient si tardifs, ce n'était pas pour permettre aux Français de faire les coqs, mais parce que Paris était un objectif
vraiment secondaire pour les Alliés :

&gt; La ville n'avait plus aucune signification tactique. En dépit de sa gloire historique, Paris ne représentait qu'une tache d'encre sur nos cartes ; il fallait l'éviter dans notre marche vers le Rhin

(Mémoires du [Général Bradley](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Bradley))

Sans les pressions du général de Gaulle et de Leclerc, la ville aurait pu se soulever (ce qu'elle commençait à faire) sans aucune aide extérieure (ni soldats alliés, ni apport d'armes). Le supérieur hiérarchique direct de Leclerc lui avait même formellement défendu de s'approcher de Paris. C'est donc contre cet ordre des Alliés, et sans attendre les ordres de de Gaulle que Leclerc, jugeant la situation critique, a lancé sa division blindée (si je me souviens bien, au moment où de Gaulle demande à Leclerc d'avancer sur Paris malgré les réticences de la hiérarchie de celui-ci, il était déjà en route !).

Eisenhower (le grand chef militaire allié) n'a validé l'opération qu'*a posteriori* ! il n'a autorisé l'opération qu'après le départ de Leclerc, et a envoyé une division américaine en renfort. Il a dû en effet se souvenir de la promesse qu'il avait donnée à de Gaulle à Alger, que Paris serait libérée par une unité française. Mais c'était une promesse faite de général à général, qui n'aurait à coup sûr pas eu le soutien du président Roosevelt, opposé à de Gaulle. Bref la réalité n'a rien à voir avec la phrase que je réécris ici :

Thing is almost every company in Russia is involved into money laundering - starting from minuscule 5 employees offices - and whole business is controlled by FSB (literally - if you want to receive cash illegally - from your own bank account, mind you - you meet real FSB agents and pay them ~5%). So arresting someone for ""money laundering"" does not make any sense except for declaration ""surely it does not related to money laundering, it's just authorities abuse uncontrollable power again"". Most likely it's Igor Sechin urgently need money for his sanctioned and sinking ""Rosneft"";

Je n'ai pas dit ça, ce serait une absurdité vu qu'on est très loin d'être ""libérés"" aujourd'hui .

Every time you walk up to a picture or video or exhibit, you swipe your device against a contact point and the narration starts in your language. It was interesting - about half way through the museum, I had that sudden realisation where I looked back at all the other people around us and figured that they were absorbing the same info and interacting with the same material in possibly well over a dozen different languages, and none of us had any idea who was using which one unless we spoke out loud.

Most people will intuitively assume that polar latitudes get less ""sunshine"" than equatorial ones. However, to a first approximation from strictly geometrical considerations, every place on Earth should on average have days that are exactly 12 hours long, since long days should exactly compensate for short ones, with everything averaging out to 12 hours. In reality, because the sun is not a point-like source and because light is refracted by the atmosphere, the average duration is actually a bit longer by a few minutes, with the polar regions actually having the longest average days!

However, what is usually defined as ""sunshine"" is a metric that is not strictly based on the amount of daylight, but rather on how many hours of ""bright"" sunshine a place receives. An arbitrary limit of 120W/m^2 was selected as the threshold for ""sunshine."" How much sunshine a place receives then becomes the convolution of two factors. 1) The amount of insolation (the average amount of solar radiation incident on a given surface area) at the top of the atmosphere is systematically higher at equatorial latitudes. You can see this trend in the top image [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Insolation.png). 2). Cloud coverage will scatter away incoming sunlight reducing the insolation as measured on the ground (see the bottom image in the picture I posted above), thus resulting in fewer ""sunny"" days being recorded.

**You're fighting the regime of Assad in Syria. But now it's being said that you're selling oil to him and that's you're fighting the rebels of Al-Nusra around Aleppo while not bothering with the soldiers of Assad**

*We're not selling oil to Assad directly, only to normal people. Maybe they're reselling it to Assad. But he sees us as his biggest enemy, don't worry. If we'd sell oil to Assad, why would we fight him? Why did we celebrate great victories against his armies this past month then? We have surrounded and attacked Firqa 17, a place close to Raqqa where a lot of his men were stationed. All of people were killed in that offensive. A lot of people were killed in the conquering of other cities in Hasaka. Recently we captured the airport of Tabqa. A giant battlefield, where 300 fighters of the IS and 170 of Assad's men were killed. Hundreds of soldiers of Assad were taken prisoner. Now say again that we're cooperating with Assad. That's a fat lie!*

**Do you know other Belgians in Raqqa? Do you have contact with them?**

*I know a lot of Belgians in Raqqa. Brian de Mulder for instance and Abu Hanifa (one of Sharia4Belgium's leaders that was supposed to stand trial, but lives in Syria now)*

**So you know people who were supposed to stand trial in the case against Sharia4Belgium?**

*Yes, but I never heard them talk about it. It doesn't interest them one bit what the government or the courts decide upon, they don't want to ever return. But it does hurt us to see what they're doing to Abu Imran and his family. And Umm Haneefa and Umm Abbas (two girls arrested May 15th at Brussels Airport on their way to Syria). That's another example of the war of Islam.*

*Abu Imran is in jail but innocent. I visited the mosque of Sharia4Belgium a few times myself. Here I also spoke with people from that organization, like Brian De Mulder, and I asked them whether it's true that Abu Imran brainwashed them. They all said he had nothing to do with this. It was sheikh Anwar Al-'Awlaqi who brainwashed them (the now deceased 'Bin Laden of the internet, who was suspected of recruiting for Al Qaeda). I as well left for Syria after I started following lectures of him on the internet. Anwar Al-'Awlaqi convinced me to go. Abu Imran did nothing wrong, he just voiced his opinion.*

**Aren't the Belgian IS fighters afraid of prosecution when they return to Belgium?**

*Some brothers are debating whether to return or ot, but they know they were be prosecuted and probably would get a hefty prison term. So they don't. I would also like to visit my parents again one day, but unfortunately that's outside of my control. If I'd do that, I'd be behind bars the very next day. And it's not allowed to put yourself in harm's way according to the Islam*

**Who big is the chance that a returned IS fighter will commit a terror attack in Belgium?**

*Bart de Wever (mayor of Antwerp and leader of the New-Flemish Alliance, Belgium's largest political party) is justified in his fear for attack in Antwerp. The chances are quite high*

**Why?**

*If people would leave the muslims alone, nothing would happen. But they start locking up people, like Abu Imran, Umm Haneefa and Umm Abbas and others that want to leave for Syria. Then you are fighting the IS, the islam and our brothers and sisters. Action begets a reaction. Don't touch us, we won't touch you.**

*Germany wants to support the Kurds who are fighting us with a €75 million investment. Then they can also expect a counterreaction. Why did America have to interfere in Iraq? During the first Gulf War, George Bush Sr. killed more than 1.5 million women and children and then I'm not even counting the men. The US wants to dominate the world, but we're not subserviant. Ok, the IS doesn't have heavy weaponry, but we have manpower. We aren't cowards and aren't afraid to die.*

*So, don't be jolted we attacks are being executed in Belguim, because your government has declared war on us, muslims. How long have Belgian soldiers been in Afghanistan now? And France? What Mohammed Merah did was justified (Mehad murdered 3 French soldiers and 4 jews in March 2012 as retribution for the French presence in Afghanistan and the Gaza situation). I love him like my own brother. When the mudjahedeen wanted to overthrow the government of Mali and instate sharia law, the French army immediately attacked them. All that, while the Malinese government was totally corrupt and killed innocent woman, men and children for years unpunished. She poisoned wells on purpose.*

*But no, whomever goes to fight in Syria against a dictator like Assad and return because he is injured or misses his family, must go to jail. Meanwhile Jews who go to help the Israeli army in expunging Palestinians from Gaza are allowed to return freely. Another piece of evidence of the Belgian war against islam*

**So you also approve of the terrorist attack in the Jewish Museum in Brussels?**

*Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. The Jews killed more than 2000 muslims in the latest Gaza war alone; most of them innocent civilians. Opposed to that are 4 casualities in the Jewish Musem. These numbers speak for themselves. Someone has to rise and defend the Palestinians*

**How do you justify having all these innocent dead on your conscience?**

*The shiites, the Americans and the Jews: for they're all the same. Especially the shiites who support the regime of Al-Assad and those that are part of the Iraqi army. Them, we will attack, kidnap and kill. That is justified, because they destroy muslims. Above Raqqa, jet fighters of Assad roar through the sky every single day, fighters he received from the Russians. He uses those to bomb Syrian civilians. Every now and again, an IS fighter is killed, but the vast majority of the casualities and injured are innocent people. My dream is to die a martyr for Allah's cause. On judgement day, the martyrs will be rewarded. We prefer death over life, and that's exactly why the West fears us.*

Also, no one seemed interested in explaining the peculiar similarities between the Romanian language and Albanian, that suggest a coexistence of the two ethno-linguistic groups somewhere in the Balkans. We are told that the similarities are there because they share words of Dacian or Thracian origin, something which is absurd and the most simplistic explanation. The fact is that people don't like to talk about this because they feel that would be against what we *have* to believe, i.e. the fact that there was this Daco-Roman continuity on the territory of present day Romania.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's not even far right anymore, only in abolished distant roots, now it's a value conservative party which wants to reduce the current mass immigration levels to the levels of immigration our neighbouring countries have, how that translates to racism is beyond me, are our neighbouring countries racists?


Sweden has the highest immigration rates in the western world, it takes ~24% of the asylum immigrants coming to the EU, why that is considered by people as rational or even remotely positive is surreal.


Not only that but it grants automatic permanent residency to almost anyone seeking asylum, meaning there is not even an attempt to help them get back home or affect their problems in their home countries.
Furthermore, we're almost exclusively taking in the strongest of the 'refugees', when the weakest are left in very uncertain conditions in conflict zones, how is that even remotely responsible?


The real thing that should be discussed is why is reasonable immigration control called racism or xenophobia over and over again, most people have neither racist ideals nor fear foreigners, they just understand that mass immigration causes too many problems which are overly evident at this point, and Sweden cannot tackle them without losing everything Sweden has stood for for in the end.


There is no surprise our neo-liberal and useful idiot leaders propose this mass immigration, it is the path to ""globalism"" as they proclaim so lovingly, globalism in this sense only means a world state under corporate rule at the moment.

If there should be globalism, shouldn't it be formed under the premise of social betterment and life quality for everyone, not utopian non-scientific concepts such as multiculturalism and mass immigration which risks destabilising the whole of Europe in the end.

However it will and by their own words has already compromised the capacity of the welfare state, and this is the goal for the neoliberals, not to help people but to transform Sweden to a more corporation friendly entity, more like USA.


If there was true desire to help these people, the help would be in the areas near to the conflict zones, and many more would be helped for the same cost of a single immigrant living on benefits, completely segregated, in a country they often don't even want to be in.


Regardless, why should Sweden be the dumping ground for more and more immigrants when it can't even integrate the ones living here, this is causing completely segregated communities which is falsely identified as ""racism"" again.

It is due to multicultural ideals outlawing any kind of reasonable assimilation that would help these people become part of the Swedish society, the assumption that any kind of values are acceptable is the falsehood here which creates this segregation.
People simply move away from areas they don't agree with, as it happens it's the ethnic Swedes moving away from immigrants, mass immigration makes the otherwise minor problems from it extreme.


Lets not forget that many Swedes who vote for this mass immigration, love, peace and whatnot, have no experience what so ever of living in these ghetto areas, they do not know the social results coming from them, both causing injustice to the immigrants themselves and ethnic Swedes.

They simply want to see the goodness of their hearts and close their eyes to the world, they replace it with dreams, I'm sure they are good people except the neoliberals, the problem is they are blind to reality and causing the problems in the first place.


People are actively moving out of immigrant neighbourhoods because of crime and impossible culture clashes, which Swedes simply don't want to be part of, it speeds up the ghettofication and segregation.
This reflects the same exact problematic situation which has existed a long time in the USA especially, an extreme example would be Detroit.


The bottom line is that multiculturalism and mass immigration will cause any countries societies regardless of ethnicity to begin a downward spiral into segregation, racism, violence and in the end corporate profiteering due to money being the only common denominator.

Segregation is already a fact of life, when the welfare state is removed, Sweden will have been turned into a low tax capitalist paradise where class differences and racism runs rampant, while ignoring the true problems causing the whole situation.


Nations are not to be toyed with as some kind play ground for artificial socio-economical experiments, not for economic profiteering nor for some globalist utopian dream resembling the ethnic cleansing in the USSR to create a single homogeneous-sapiens where ALL differences are to be eliminated.

But I can't quit the job, because I need money and nobody wants to employ me as a songwriter. Under basic income, I quit my job and start to write songs that nobody is willing to pay for.

If it turns out nobody is willing to pay for it, then you go back to truck driving, or some other job which is hopefully more appealing, in order to get the supplementary income back, because you're not content with subsistence living. The truck driving company may have to adjust its wages somewhat to be attractive on the labour market, but because the income they pay is *in addition to* some portion of the basic income (assuming truck driving isn't more lucrative than I'd imagine it to be), people are still willing to do it for the additional income. The overall effect on the cost of living is that some things may become more expensive because they lose desperation as a means to underpay their workers, while other areas become less expensive because you see more people taking the risk of working in those areas instead of taking a less attractive job which they're more likely to be able to hold.

Éthiquement c'est limite, mais surtout une fois que tu obtiens la nationalité d'un pays de l'UE, au nom de la libre circulation des personnes, ils ont autant le droit de venir (travailler ou pas) en France ou ailleurs. Exemple : la famille Dibrani et l'affaire ""Leonarda"" (kosovarde) qui a été expulsée de France et renvoyée dans son pays, mais qui a obtenue la nationalité Croate et a donc informé notre président par l'intermédiaire des média qu'elle allait revenir... Dans ce cas, ils ont pas été malin car il existe un article de l'UE qui permet aux membres de limiter la circulation sous certaines conditions... Mais c'est le sommet de l'iceberg.

Se ti capita di andare in Giappone o Corea sbizzarrisciti, ma il livello in Italia è infimo; le palestre, in particolare, soffrono una carenza gravissima di kendoka bravi disposti ad insegnare, con il risultato che in molti posti sei costretto a imparare o da persone mediocri (e incapaci di insegnare) o da maestri che gestiscono molteplici palestre e non riescono veramente a seguire ciascuna con l'attenzione necessaria.

Questo succede anche con altre arti marziali orientali, ma per il kendo è un problema particolarmente grave. La pratica corretta ed efficace richiede un'attenzione quasi feticistica alla precisione dei movimenti e alla forma dei fondamentali; cose apparentemente minori come la posizione delle dita nella presa dalla spada o la chiusura delle braccia durante l'attacco fanno un mondo di differenza (e non in termini di inezie, ma proprio di riuscire a eseguire i movimenti o a colpire), e gli inevitabili errori possono essere corretti solo con l'aiuto e l'insegnamento di un kendoka più esperto. Questo è il motivo fondamentale alla base del sistema senpai\kohai, che però in Italia praticamente non esiste.

La disciplina in sé è sicuramente divertente, e in altre circostanze avrei continuato a praticarla.

Nothing too noticeable, but I'll try to muster something:

* Usual pre-presidential-election activities continue, opposition candidate Kolinda Grabar Kitarović vs. current president Ivo Josipović, nothing remarkable actually ([link1](http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/grabar-kitarovic-otkriva-zasto-bi-bila-bolja-predsjednica-od-josipovica-962332) [link2](http://vijesti.hrt.hr/spreman-sam-i-na-referendumu-traziti-potporu) [link3](http://vijesti.hrt.hr/imam-poriv-da-pomognem-hrvatskoj-i-dovoljno-sam-jaka-za-to), all in Croatian unfortunately, sorry)

* Few liberal and LGBT associations protest on one of main squares in Zagreb, demanding cancellation of accords between Croatia and Vatican, according to which Catholic church in Croatia receives certain amounts of country's budget money annualy (~300mil HRK ~= 40mil€, plus donations from local authorities). Protest went mostly peacefully, aside from one minor incident.

* Conservative association ""In the name of family"" begins with collecting signatures for referendum, aimed at changing election rules (making it more similar to European Parliament elections, in which one can choose candidate from a list directly). Some liberal organisations voiced support for the referendum, unlike in previous referendum called by ""In the name of family"", which aimed at constitutionally barring gay marriages. [link in croatian](http://vijesti.hrt.hr/pocelo-prikupljanje-potpisa-za-mijenjanje-izbornog-zakona)

* Former Split mayor, Željko Kerum, made appearance in parliament, of which he is elected part (he got into it via weird coalition with now-opposition conservative-ish HDZ) for the first time this year. He said he dropped by to ""see what's up"". [cro link](http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/nakon-dugo-vremena-u-saboru-se-pojavio-zeljko-kerum---352565.html)

Meine Woche war stressig, das Wochenende relativ kacke.
Am Freitag musste ich erstmal zum Tierarzt, weil einer meiner beiden Wellensittiche Atemprobleme hatte - Diagnose: Lungenentzündung. Noice.

Der arme Piepmatz musste erstmal mit seinem Kumpel unter Antibiotika gesetzt werden, mit Lungenbeschwerden ist bei Vögeln nicht zu spaßen, da ist schon akute Lebensgefahr. 

Freitag abend kam auch noch die Verwandschaft, weil Samstag meine Oma runden Geburtstag hatte, und die blieben bis Sonntag.
Eigentlich mag ich ja meine Verwandten, aber wegen Haufen Schulstress, einer nicht so leichten Erkältung und meinem Vogelproblem war ich grade nicht in Stimmung.

Trotzdem habe ich versucht, bei der Feier mir nix anmerken zu lassen, was nicht geklappt hat. Um 20:30 kapitulierte ich und bin mit Kopfschmerzen und zuen Ohren ins Bett gefallen. Meine Verwandten nahmen das nicht so auf die leichte Schulter, aber das war mir in dem Moment scheißegal.

Sonntag dürfte ich feststellen, das meine Regel 1 1/2 Wochen früher als gedacht kam, was meinen gesamten Hormonhaushalt durcheinander geworfen hat. Deshalb habe ich mich den ganzen Tag in meinem Zimmer verbarrikadiert, weinte 2 Mal, weil meine LB-Taste am Controller nicht mehr ging und guckte halbwach irgendwelche Sitcoms.

Ein Glück geht es meinen beiden Piepmätzen wieder besser, das Antibiotikum hat angeschlagen. Jedenfalls eine gute Sache. Trotzdem ist da immernoch die Erkältung, die Ohrenschmerzen und das Verlangen Brokeback Mountain zum 4. Mal zu gucken.

true,e1821e,GREE,Greece,"&gt; the Greek government's own investigators came to a similar result, especially on some of the islands

You probably don't speak Greek. Inspections in mainland and island locations are targeted. This is the way all similar European tax evasion departments work. They gather intelligence on their own, listen to customer complaints etc. They don't just roam around because they would waste resources. [This is the latest Ministry of Finance press release](http://www.minfin.gr/portal/el/resource/contentObject/id/5d10a1e7-c8ee-4b2e-ac58-a31d546f4402) about the results of the investigations during the first 7 months of 2014. Google translation is a bit messy but you can figure out what's going on.

&gt; &gt; The police Economic Crime (SDOE) publishes aggregated results of surveys conducted during the first seven months of 2014 in the framework of its powers.

&gt; &gt; During the above period conducted 2,639 investigations in selected against 2,295 planned, ie the objective oversubscribed at 115%. There were 390,028 offenses to 1,872 offenders (average delinquency rate of 54%).

&gt; &gt; The SDOE also accepted at the same time, to explore 755 prosecutors orders, of which 585 already settled off while being examined and are integration-from preceding years 1684. 

The economic crime unit (ΣΔΟΕ) investigated more businesses than they had planned to. Half of the business **that were targeted** were found to break the law for a number of reasons. That's **not** half of all businesses in Greece.  You might be impressed by the large number of offenses per business but that's easy to explain. Most of these businesses are fast food restaurants, taverns, bars and nightclubs. Offenses vary in seriousness. In many cases they did issue receipts and pay their taxes but they were fined based on the number of customers present during the inspection night for other reasons. 

&gt; he's actually making it quite clear that the wide spread tax evasion results in higher taxes for those who pay them

I take issue with the assessment about allegedly widespread tax evasion, not with the general principle that those paying tax also pay for tax evaders. In fact, tax evasion per capita and in total amounts is bigger in countries considered fiscally sound. [Netherlands, for example.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-23/yahoo-dell-swell-netherlands-13-trillion-tax-haven.html) Together with [Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement) they make the best sandwiches. Also Germany accepted [1% of hidden German wealth in Switzerland](http://www.globalsocialjustice.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=133:david-mcnair&amp;catid=5:analysis&amp;Itemid=6). Let's not forget the role of Luxembourg for Central and North Europe while we're at it. But I don't see many people making much fuss about it. Greece's current position cannot be explained by moralizing or by attributing everything to the Greek inability to deal with tax evasion. Tax evasion exists but this wasn't the main factor driving Greece through successive deficits, resulting in being blocked from the markets and ending up in a Troika program.

&gt; He's also in jail because of it.

He was not in jail for the better part of his life and he was considered a model citizen until he was caught. He ended up in jail after an investigation and after his political connections and his expensive lawyers failed to save him. The difference is that I don't think that the German society as a whole failed because it enables people like Uli to do what he did. There is nothing that makes Greeks or Germans or Irish or other Europeans better or worse than other nations.",0,1411324242,null,0,1411382586,0,ckol36o,t3_2h0xrk,t1_ckol36o,t1_ckoe7gt,null,1426891614,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
