**Why total rankings are a waste of time.**

Say you're a strapping young human being of your preferred gender. Say you have set your mind to study something that you really like, or at least will open the doors to the wonderful world of adult worklife.

How to go about finding the best place to study?

Well, you look at rankings. It's an objective form of deciding if your university holds up to its high-falutin' promises of brillianance careers for its alumni. It's only natural to be suspicious, and the reasonable thing to do is to collect data, then form your own opinion.

But wait - what exactly does a total ranking tell you? 

It's the aggregate of all kinds of different rankings, ranging from things that might interest you (professor-student ratio) to things that are entirely irrelevant unless you're a graduate student (level of papers quoted from a given department or professor) to completely batshit crazy nonsense (numbers of nobel laureates, where most of the time not even a distinction between fields are made. I bet the fact that your university had 3 literary nobel prize winners pre-1960 will be very important to your metamaterial engineering course!)

There's absolutely no question that looking at very specific data points that will be relevant to your particular situation is beneficial to your decision (undergraduate student? graduate student? researcher? working adult looking to get an MBA? - all require **very** different datasets). Comparing universities based on those is absolutely vital.

One of the most important ones might be the academic field that interest you, and how your university fares in this. Let me tell you a tale. 

You don't see many German universities in the top ten. Yet a disproportionate amount - i.e. a number you would not expect seeing those universities up there - of mathematics professors around the world have studied, at some point, in Germany. And quite a lot of those at a university you don't even see in the above ranking. 

It's been like this for years. Why is this? Because most of our universities, which might be entirely unremarkable in any other way, have an extremely strong and internationally recognised mathematics tradition. Some are even, in their subfield, recognised as internationally relevant and the place to go for research in a particular subfield of mathematics **even before Cambridge, Oxford, etc.**. There's also the fact that most of our research output (a big factor in aggregate data sets) is published under the name Max-Planck or Fraunhofer, but they do not show up in any rankings whatsoever. This latter problem is true in other fields as well.

And Germany isn't the only one. Especially eastern Europe has an *immensely* strong mathematics tradition, easily matching anything in the Anglosphere, with the same results. I mean, have you *looked* at the professors at those universities? 

Yet they never show up.

And I've already mentioned a second problem. It doesn't matter if some exotic variety of stringtheory is best studied at a grand ecole if what you really want is to do research in an entirely different field where the best professors might sit in Italy.

While this might be only important to a graduate student, remember that many if not most of the aggregate data points that go into total rankings *are only relevant to graduate students*, tracking research output, citations, international students, etc.

A nobel prize winning lecturer doesn't equal a brilliant teacher, or a good teaching system. 

There is no denial that the best of the best in those rankings give a good indication where you can *start* your search for the university that suits you best, but it is by no means the end of the story. Depending of what you want to do, they are even a worse choice than other establishments. But you'd have known this anyway, if only for their reputation, which quite likely is another whole can of worms we won't discuss here (what came first: the ranking, or the reputation?). 

The only thing that might be said for total rankings is that they give an indiciation of which universities' places will most likely remain invariant under change of preferences. But as my above discussion of the fact that subfields of the same field might be located in entirely different locations hopefully showed you, such change of preferences might even turn the best university entirely irrelevant.

I apologise for my rambling, but this annoys me to no end.

**tl;dr: total rankings suck because they completely forget about the very special needs you yourself might require when searching for the best university. Entirely different rankings would be created on that. There is no objective ""best"" university, if only because they vary sharply across fields.**

Edit: Typos. Many more for you to find!

true,Nihy,ASTR,Austria,"&gt; It is often claimed that “trillions of GM meals” have been eaten in the US with no ill effects. However, no epidemiological studies in human populations have been carried out to establish whether there are any health effects associated with GM food consumption. As GM foods are not labelled in North America, a major producer and consumer of GM crops, it is scientifically impossible to trace, let alone study, patterns of consumption and their impacts. Therefore, claims that GM foods are safe for human health based on the experience of North American populations have no scientific basis. 

I'm curious what you think about this point. What's the problem here? Do you not think that they have a point?

&gt; An EU research project[27] has been cited internationally as providing evidence for GM crop and food safety. However, the report based on this project, “A Decade of EU-Funded GMO Research”, presents no data that could provide such evidence, from long-term feeding studies in animals.

&gt; Indeed, the project was not designed to test the safety of any single GM food, but to focus on “the development of safety assessment approaches”.[28] Only five published animal feeding studies are referenced in the SAFOTEST section of the report, which is dedicated to GM food safety.[29] None of these studies tested a commercialised GM food; none tested the GM food for long-term effects beyond the subchronic period of 90 days; all found differences in the GM-fed animals, which in some cases were statistically significant; and none concluded on the safety of the GM food tested, let alone on the safety of GM foods in general. Therefore the EU research project provides no evidence for sweeping claims about the safety of any single GM food or of GM crops in general. 

I also find this very strange. Going by the rhetoric of GMO advocates, one would that there's some rock solid science behind the claims of GMO safety, but reality seems to be different.

    Les sangliers sont lachés
    Je répète :
    les sangliers sont lachés.

    Les petits patrons font les grandes rivières de diamant.
    Deux fois.
    Les roses de l’Europe sont le festin de Satan.
    Je répète :

    Nous travaillons actuellement pour l’Europe.
    Nous travaillons actuellement pour l’Europe.
    Nous travaillons actuellement pour l’Europe.
    Nous travaillons actuellement pour l’Europe.
    Voire pour le monde.

    Chère vieille Europe, cher vieux continent, putain autoritaire,
    aristocrate et libertaire, bourgeoise et ouvrière,
    pourpre et pomponnée de grands siècles et colosses titubants.
    Regarde tes épaules voûtées, pas moyen d’épousseter d’un seul geste,
    d’un seul, les vieilles pellicules, les peaux mortes d’hier et tabula rasa…
    D’ici on pourrait croire à de la pourriture noble et en suspention.
    il flotte encore dans l’air de cette odeur de soufre. Sale vieille Europe,
    celle qui entre deux guerres et même encore pendant caressait pour son bien
    le ventre des pays de ses lointains ailleurs et la bite à la main
    arrosait de son sperme les sexes autochtones.
    On se relève de ça ? On se relève de tout même des chutes sans fond.
    Nous avons su monter nous avons su descendre, nous pouvons arrêter
    et nous pouvons reprendre…
    Europe des lumières ou alors des ténèbres ;
    à peine des lucioles dans les théâtres d’ombre.
    A peine une étincelle dans la nuit qui s’installe et puis se ressaisit,
    et puis l’aube nouvelle, après les crimes d’enfance,
    les erreurs de jeunesse on n’arrache plus les ailes des libellules d’or.

    Nous travaillons actuellement pour l’Europe.
    Voire pour le monde.

    Amnistie, amnistie ou alors amnésie, qu’est-ce que vous volez que ça foute,
    de toutes façons il faut bien avancer, pressons le pas camarade
    et puis réalisons réalisons, il en restera toujours quelque chose allez !
    Matérialiste alors ça fait qu’au moins on est sûr de n’pas de tromper,
    et du tangible alors jusqu’à l’indigestion, du rationnel alors
    et jusqu’à en crever, des logiques implacables mais toujours pas de sens…
    Eh princesse de l’Histoire dans sa marche forcée,
    on finit par se perdre en passant sous tes arches multiséculaires.

    Voire pour le monde.
    Nous travaillons actuellement pour l’Europe.

    On est passé de tes arcanes passées, passé de tes arcanes passées,
    on est passé de tes arcanes passées, aux charmes technocrates…
    Alors l’Europe alors l’Europe alors l’Europe.

    nouveaux maîtres du monde pendant que le dragon asiatique rêve, fait ses étirements,

    Pendant qu’Ernest Antoine Seillière fait son apparition et nous déclare sa flamme
    il nous aime et nous dit :
     » Nous ne sommes pas comme les politiques soumis à la pression de la rue.  »
    Et on entend au loin résonner les clameurs de la foule,
    les beaux mouvements d’ensemble, les défilés glorieux et puis la lutte des classes.
    Et maintenant c’est sérieux, eh bébé, c’est sérieux, on ne croit plus en rien,
    nous montons de toutes pièces ce buisness et Basta, on chevauche pas Pégase
    ça c’était pour l’extase c’est fini.
    Extension, expansion si possible, mais pas de rêve à porter seulement des dynamiques.
    D’abord la thune, bébé et le reste suivra et le reste viendra c’est ce qu’on dit
    je crois en cette époque là bénie des globophages.
    Chère vieille Europe, ta tête connaît à peine tes jambes qui souvent
    ne comprennent pas tes bras comment ça marche encore déjà.
    Comment ça marche un corps étranger à son corps on n’sait pas on s’en fout
    on s’embrasse quand même et puis on a raison.
    Sale vieille Europe, te souviens-tu de la force brutale, occident mal luné,
    guerre brûlante, guerre froide, et enfin de guerre lasse et enfin de guerre lasse.

    Nous travaillons actuellement pour l’Europe.

    En veux-tu en voilà des écoles de la performance et voilà des patrons
    créateurs du Global buisness dialogue ou Electronic commerce

    on a dit pour tout le monde, pour tout le monde, pour tout l’monde et mon cul !

    A quelle hauteur vas-tu ériger tes remparts ?
    Où vas-tu repousser tes nouveaux murs d’enceinte ?

    Quelque chose est resté en travers de la gorge et nous voulons cracher
    c’est la moindre des choses mais vous pouvez, madame,
    vous adresser à nous car tout n’est pas perdu non tout n’est pas perdu
    de vos mythes d’aurore ici le soleil brille pour tous et on y croit.

In my opinion it is often not really a lie but an exaggeration, or a twist of the facts to get what they want.

For example if there are elections in a city, the Integrationsrat is outraged because some immigrants have to bring their documents before they are allowed to vote. ""Thats racist and we should have the same rights as Germans...""

What they don't mention is that everybody who wasn't born in that city has to bring the documents, even the Germans who moved there. It's just a database related problem.

Another example would be the outrage if some of their kids aren't able to visit private schools (Private Gymnasien). Racism bla bla. It doesn't count for them that the school accepts only the best pupils or enrolled siblings and most Germans have to visit a public school too. Nope, racism.

It's often really anoying to work with them because it isn't constructive to play the racism card every time there is a problem.

**BRAUNAU** - Boss Hannes Froschauer about the rules in his café on the Braunau mainsquare.

Two observations from the cafe/bar Barsilica in Braunau: A young Croatian girl who lives in Braunau visits the cafe on the mainsquare after a walk with her cousin. They order and talk to each other - in Croatian. The waitress asks them several times while passing to please speak German. To the statement that the guest is a tourist and can't speak German she replied: ""In Austria you have to be able to speak German and the boss wants it that way""

Second szene: A young women orders a soda water - in English. She speaks with a friend on the phone, also in English. The waiter is vividly speaking with the non-german-speaking guest.

**Foreigners not welcome**

Confronted with those two observerations the Barsilica owner Hannes Froschauer replies: ""In my house only German is spoken, otherwise I get afraid. They could be terrorists after all."" But he does understand English, that's the difference. ""In my house only properly clothed people are welcome. The style is of course a question of personal preferences, but in my bar no hats, no tracksuits, no rubberboots etc are allowed."", says the Barsilica boss.

Foreigners are also not welcome, and the owner stands by that: ""That's the secret of my success, that's why my bar is well visited since 10 years"", he assures. Nobody from the locals wants to go in a bar where they speak foreignerish (sic!). Because Hannes Froschauer knows for sure ""Once you have one table full of turks or yugoslavs, you suddenly have ten of them. And then no locals or tourists would come anymore"". He can't tell us why the guest from the first scene, a tourist, was asked to speak German though because he wasn't present in the cafe at that moment.

**""It's like my living room""**

&gt; This journalist doesn't like me very much as it seems

&gt; I'M NOT A RACIST, just a barowner.

&gt; Unbelievable how fast such a negative news bit travels

&gt; Press release to the article in the Branauer Rundschau from the 8th of May 2014

&gt; Statement Hannes Froschauer

&gt; The Bar Silica in Branau exists now since nealry 10 years. We are a world open establishment where guests of all age groups and nationalities are welcome. Due to the article from the Braunauer Rundschau from the 8th of May a wrong image of our bar was presented because of one possible incident.

&gt; What really happens that afternoon with the tourist from Croatia is outside of my knowledge, because I wasn't there that time. We're sorry, if this guest didn't feel well treated. The statement from the article that our customers have to speak German in our rooms or terrace is not true.

&gt; In the Bar Silica everybody is welcome who likes to consume in our facilities and/or likes to enjoy the Braunau main square from our garden. Our guests are made up of all nationalities, including many tourists from all kinds of countries. We don't care which language the customers speak. We try to deliver the best service to all customers

&gt; We do care about the appearance of our guests. We do emphasize , for the sake of our customers, that nobody goes on a rampage in our house or that no disputes start, especially not between different nationalities. Our experience shows that some guests destroyed the house peace, this should be prevented when possible.

&gt; We also demand appropriate clothing from our customers, because I care about cultured company. We owe it to our guests to not service or throw out unpleasant people. We try to prevent troubles in the first place. We also expect the same from many of our fix clientele.

&gt; I'm sorry if the croatian tourist or journalist of the Brauner Rundschau didn't feel threated accordingly. We invite both of them to our our to get this thing out of the world.

&gt; The following year, like the Terminator, Napoleon was back.

No comment.

&gt; Two hundred years on, the French still cannot agree on whether Napoleon was a hero or a villain.

Why does he have to be one of those ?

&gt; “The divide is generally down political party lines,” says professor Peter Hicks, a British historian with the Napoléon Foundation in Paris. “On the left, there’s the ’black legend’ of Bonaparte as an ogre. On the right, there is the ’golden legend’ of a strong leader who created durable institutions.”

That's just not true. Napoléon is not a subject of political debate at all, contrary to Robespierre. The article itself states later that two *right-wing* leaders didn't attend a ceremony about Napoléon.

&gt; The cost of the Fontainebleau “farewell” and scores of related events over three weekends was shouldered not by the central government in Paris but by the local château, a historic monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, and the town of Fontainebleau.

Breaking news : the government doesn't throw money at every local associations of history geeks. I'd like to hear more about those ""scores"" of events, besides.

&gt; While the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution that toppled the monarchy and delivered thousands to death by guillotine was officially celebrated in 1989

DAE the Revolution is evil ?

&gt; For example, a decade ago, the president and prime minister—at the time, Jacques Chirac and Dominque de Villepin—boycotted a ceremony marking the 200th anniversary of the battle of Austerlitz, Napoleon’s greatest military victory.

They didn't boycott it, they ignored it. The then-ministry of defence did go to a ceremony in the Czech Republic. Also, De Villepin is an admirer of Napoléon who's written books about him ; obviously mentioning that wouldn't fit the narrative.

&gt; There are no squares, nor places, nor boulevards named for Napoleon and only one narrow street, the rue Bonaparte, running from the Luxembourg Gardens to the River Seine. And, that, too, is thanks to Napoleon III.

All the big avenues south of Paris are named after his generals. All of his victories have streets or stations named after them. The biggest squares of Paris feature monuments dedicated to him (Arc de Triomphe, Obélisque de la Concorde, Colonne Vendôme). The street facing the Arc de Triomphe is called ""Avenue de la Grande-Armée"", the nearest one is ""Avenue de Wagram"".

&gt; ""Napoleon was not a French patriot—he was first a Corsican and later an imperial figure, a journey in which he bypassed any deep affiliation with the French nation""

What is that bullshit ? Napoléon was French, he studied at a French military school and rose through the ranks of the French military, he lived in Paris for most of his life. Nobody in France disputes that he was French. Corsican and French. And nobody even remotely cares whether he was a ""patriot"".

&gt; Evidently, an overwhelming majority knew which side their baguette was buttered on.

Get it ? Because baguette is a French kind of bread ! Haha !

&gt; [Napoléon's achivements included] the metric system and freedom of religion.

More than debatable. The metric system was introduced before Napoléon ; his conquests helped spread it abroad. He added to the confusion (but probably helped the system become universal in the long run) by introducing new units defined in metric but with old names (like a pint = 50cL, a pound = 500g and so on).

As for freedom of religion, towards the end Republican governments had already stopped oppressing religious people. Napoléon just let the catholic church come back.

&gt; “He was a savior of France. If there had been no Napoleon, the Republic would not have survived.”

What ? The Republic survived ? There wasn't a stable Republican regime before the 1880s. There wasn't a remotely democratic parliamentarian regime before 1830.

&gt; “Like Cincinnatus in ancient Rome, Napoleon wanted a dictatorship of public salvation. He gets all the power, and, when the project is finished, he returns to his plough.”

""Returns to his plough"" as in ""has his family run Europe"" ?

&gt; In the event, the old order was never restored in France. When Louis XVIII became emperor in 1814, he served as a constitutional monarch.

Louis XVIII, the *brother* of guillotined Louis XVI. And there was no real constitution before 1830, just a vague ""charter"" under which the parliament had very little power.

Yes, feudalism and customary law were never restored. Because it's completely impossible anyway.

&gt; ""The whole world is fascinated. More books have been written about him than anyone in history""

[citation needed]

&gt; Napoleon and his exploits are scarcely mentioned in French schools anymore.

Bullshit. The truth is that Napoléon-worshippers are pissed off because he his very accurately portrayed in modern school textbooks. Textbooks mention, in addition to the ""exploits"", things like the dos y tres de mayo or Fouché's first political police in history, and they can't stand that.

&gt; In the past, history was the study of great men and women. Today the focus of teaching is on trends, issues and movements. “France in 1800 is no longer about Louis XVI and Napoleon Bonaparte. It’s about the industrial revolution,” says Chanteranne.

""Oh no, we now have a rational approach to history !"" Also, French school textbooks actually feature *both* industrial revolution timelines *and* biographies of Louis XVI and Napoléon, as it should be.

&gt; “Man does not make history. History makes men.”

The whole Third Reich thing is a big stain on Germany's reputation, and after WW2 the collective feeling was ""never again"". The military was there for Germany's self-defence, and if it got involved in other countries, it was for humanitarian purposes. Under no circumstances, it was felt, should Germany ever be a party to any kind of military aggression.

That stance was put to the test during the conflict in Kosovo, pretty much on Germany's doorstep. A lot of soul-searching went into that one: one the one hand, here was a bloody civil war that had overtones of the kind of genocide (the Muslim population was being exterminated in what was being called ""ethnic cleansing"") that Nazi Germany had perpetrated, and how could Germany stand passively by and allow it to happen; on the other hand, any kind of military intervention was a taboo, especially when reports of, for example, Americans apparently attacking diplomatic and civilian targets were circulating.

Since then, Germany has been providing more support for military operations elsewhere and occasionally been involved in actual fighting; but this isn't without controversy. Some Germans see this as being complicit in America's imperialist takeover of the world, and every report of a mistake or a scandal of some kind is seen as evidence; the popular press report these issues in the way that suggests that they, and therefore much of the German population, don't fully support German involvement.",0,1399659397,null,0,false,0,chdtky0,t3_2554o2,t1_chdtky0,t3_2554o2,null,1433724684,18,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,18

the difference is in the standard at which the universities hold their students, i.e. it's much easier to cheat in serbia than it is in canada (or any other organized nation for that matter), so while the curriculum might not be as difficult, on average, the canadian graduate might be at a higher level than a serbian one. for instance, if you get caught cheating in serbia, it's likely that not much will happen - they'll simply null your grade, and you'll have to take your exam at a later date. if you the same happened in canada, you're in deep shit brah.

&gt; A day will come when your arms will fall even from your hands!

&gt; A day will come when war will seem as absurd and impossible between Paris and London, between Petersburg and Berlin, between Vienna and Turin, as it would be impossible and would seem absurd today between Rouen and Amiens, between Boston and Philadelphia.

&gt; A day will come when you France, you Russia, you Italy, you England, you Germany, you all, nations of the continent, without losing your distinct qualities and your glorious individuality, will be merged closely within a superior unit and you will form the European brotherhood, just as Normandy, Brittany, Burgundy, Lorraine, Alsace, all our provinces are merged together in France.

&gt; A day will come when the only fields of battle will be markets opening up to trade and minds opening up to ideas.

&gt; A day will come when canonballs and bombs will be replaced by votes, by the universal suffrage of the peoples, by the venerable arbitration of a great sovereign senate which will be to Europe what the parliament is to England, what the diet is to Germany, what the legislative assembly is to France!

&gt; A day will come when we will display cannon in museums just as we display instruments of torture today, and are amazed that such things could ever have been possible!

&gt; A day will come when we shall see those two immense groups, the United States of America and the United States of Europe, placed face to face, stretching out their hands across the seas, exchanging their products, their commerce, their arts, their genius, clearing up the globe, conquering deserts, ameliorating creation under the eyes of the Creator, and joining together, for the well-being of all, these two infinite forces, the fraternity of men and the power of God!

No, the excellence of the Swiss universities is based on the fact that they are extremely well funded and well managed, and have been so for a very long time. That creates a positive feedback loop producing excellent research groups which in turn attract students and so on.

It was a newly built area, with plenty of square-ish buildings that I took to be apartments, a couple of business buildings in advanced stages of construction and very few shops and bars. There wasn't much greenery and the whole area looked very sparse. There were very few people around.

I spent some time walking around trying to find the mall, but I wasn't familiar with the area and ended up feeling disoriented while sweating a lot (this was in full daylight in June). I eventually gave up and went back to the city centre.

I went back a couple days later, got off one stop later at Las Suertes and managed to find the mall, then on the way back I think I stopped at Villa de Vallecas and walked to the next metro stop out of curiosity - I can't remember very well anymore, but I recall walking through a kind of town that looked somewhat low-income, but not at all bad.

Very well. First off, in Pompei you *have to* stop for dinner at Add'u Mimi if you like fish and seafood. Best overall restaurant in the city, also really close to the excavations. Better for dinner than for lunch because at dinner they serve *frittura di paranza*, a mixture of fried small fish from the daily catch that I strongly advise you try.

Second, if you stop in Naples for even a few hours I highly advise visiting the Naples National Archaeologic Museum (MANN, Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli) which has an incredible collection of Roman and Greek art, including several of the most iconic Pompei wall paintings that were cut out and taken to Naples for preservation.

When in Pompei, do bring a hat with a sizable rim as the sun is rather unforgiving. The café in the middle of the excavations is rather good, but the salads are way overpriced for their size (the sandwiches on the other hand are great). Avoid the restaurants and kiosks just outside the excavations, they are horrific tourist traps that serve obscenely overpriced and very low quality food and drink. There are fountains inside the excavations and water is very much safe for drinking. Also, if you plan to buy *anything* from any of the souvenir and gadget vendors, be assured that they'll give you a starting price that's absurdly high, but they will haggle.

&gt;__Blera__ is a small town and *[comune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comune)* in the northern [Lazio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazio) region of [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) near [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome), known during the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages) as __Bieda__, an evolved form of its ancient name, which was restored in the 20th century. It is the birthplace of [Pope Sabinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sabinian); [Pope Paschal II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Paschal_II) was also originally thought to be from here.

&gt;It is situated on a long, narrow tongue of rock at the junction of two deep glens.

Not to rain on the parade, but I will submit this excerpt from *Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch* just so we don't get too self-satisfied.

&gt; The state of peace among men living side by side is not the natural state (status naturalis); the natural state is one of war. This does not always mean open hostilities, but at least an unceasing threat of war. A state of peace, therefore, must be established, for in order to be secured against hostility it is not sufficient that hostilities simply be not committed; and, unless this security is pledged to each by his neighbour (a thing that can occur only in a civil state), each may treat his neighbour, from whom he demands this security, as an enemy.

EDIT: The ending of the speech you quote is more ominous.

&gt; It is after all a prodigious and admirable epoch, and the nineteenth century will be - let us say it openly - the greatest page in history. As I reminded you just now, all our advances are revealing and manifesting themselves together, in rapid succession: the decline in international animosity, the disappearance of frontiers from maps and of prejudices from hearts, a movement towards unity, a softening of manners, an increase in the level of education and a drop in the level of penalties, the dominance of the most literary, that is to say the most humane, languages; everything is moving at once, political economy, science, industry, philosophy, legislation, and is converging upon the same end, the creation of well-being and benevolence, and that for me is the end to which I shall always strive, the extinction of misery inside and of war outside.",0,1399663769,null,0,1399664072,0,chdvp35,t3_254awn,t1_chdvp35,t1_chduja1,null,1433725681,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

I do not think that people dead from starvation or drones are feeling more secure.

Considering the social inequality in ""many western nations"" I would suggest programs to increase ""social security"" ... Oh wait :-)

true,TheTiltster,,Provinz Rheinland,"To quote a popular comic artist: ""With great power comes great responsibility.""

Personally, I don´t think that military interventions can solve anything in the long run, but unfortunately, that´s what hides behind the buzzword ""global security"".

Germany is often described as the ""economic powerhouse"" of Europe, and I deeply believe that this is what Germanys real power lies in. Every time a german Head of Government or a member of the government visits another country, they always have an entourage of businessmen and company representatives with them who want to make business with their local counterparts - whitch is absolutely fine for me. And because we are such an economic superpower, many people want to do business with us.
And of course, you can connect economic relations with political demands, as easy as that.

Another ""power"" of Germany lies in its younger past, in the last 60 years, to be exact. We managed to reconsile with our neighbours (you know, those countries we invaded in WWII) and are now on more than friendly terms with most of them (well, Russia is another story, I guess).

We didn´t manage this only with economic relations, but with cooperations on the cultural and educational level. This way, we managed to turn the relations with our ""arch-enemy"" France from beeing ""hereditary enemies"" to ""super-super-best friends"". This experience I think is one of the most valuable assets Germany has to offer regarding envolvement in international affairs.

If that would happen - thousands would die, cities would burn, production capacity would collapse, ability to support the navy would quickly deteriorate, and Germany would still keep it's factories and logistics fully operational.

Loosing the Battle of Britain would mean USSR had to win a war for Germany to collapse. Pretty much the only chance Germany could have to survive WW2 is if:

* USSR would collapse very quickly on the Eastern Front (eg. assassination of Stalin, strategic bombardments of factories in deep Russia)
* Allies loose Battle of Britain (Germany bombs RAF airfields, gains air superiority, begins bombardment of factories, ports and major cities)

J'ai la flemme de rechercher les chiffres donc je vais juste reposter mon  ancien commentaire :

Il semble que pour la plupart de ces titres l'aide se limite aux [aides postales] (http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aides_%C3%A0_la_presse_en_France#Les_aides_postales). Ce qui n'est pas le cas chez le monde diplo.

On peut également constater que l'aide totale par exemplaire vendu est plus élevé au Monde diplo  (0,1090) que chez Closer (0,0273).

Bref, un article légèrement biaisé du diplo pour changer, même si comme eux, l'on aimerait bien comprendre les critères d'attribution des différentes aides. Il semblerait qu'il y ait un lien évident avec la diffusion, mais en voyant que Libé touche plus que Aujourd’hui, pour une diffusion 2 fois moins élevée, on se pose des questions.

true,lockdownit,cinefilo,,"You can find near the duomo a coffee shop not unlike starbucks -  it's called Arnold Coffee, and you'll be able to get your fix. Remember that in Italy when you ask for a coffee you get an Espresso. Always. 

Getting around in Milan is pretty easy and safe, easier still if you stick to the ""touristy"" destinations. You can go wherever via public transit, and taxis are common (not new york common, but common).

You can find some modern-er art exhibit in the Royal Palace (just on the side of the duomo). The DaVinci museum is a Science and Technics museum, so no pieces of art here, just science exhibit. But it's fun, because you can touch almost everyhting.

For the Last Supper you need to go to the Cenacolo - but you have to reserve a spot in advance! [check it out](http://www.cenacolo.it/the-last-supper/). It might be an hassle but hey, you'll get to see on of the best pieces of art, ever.

Cheap Shopping is really defined by what you classify as Cheap. If you're into shopping, fill your eyes with the goodness of the high class boutiques in via montenapoleone/via della spiga and all the small street in that zone. Be wary that this is seriously pricey stuff we're talking about. From san Babila the you can take Corso Venezia and stroll along - you'll see many more peasant oriented shops. You'll eventually get to Porta Venezia (once, when we still had walls, if you travelled from or to venice you had to pass from this door here. Nifty stuff). Follow around Corso Buenos Aires for more, cheap shopping.

On a sunday, everyhting in Milan is open for business. Some shops will be closed on monday morning, but not the bigger names. As for food, you won't have problems.

Someone here proposed Luini: he does a mean panzerotto on the cheap. Near Luini there's Musubi, a new place that does Japanese Fusion (on the cheap, too). In front of it there's Spontini, one of the oldest pizza chains in Milano - great pizza and, yes, on the cheap. All this is literally two steps away from the Cathedral - set your gps for via Santa Radegonda with Via San Raffaele. There are other restaurants in the same zone, price range from Cheap to You Must Be A Tourist. There's a place called ""Cioccolati Italiani"" that does a mean chocholate, you'll want to check it out.

Best thing you can do on a sunday? reverse the shopping route I suggested before. start from piazzale loreto, climb up Buenos Aires and Corso Venezia. Then you're in San Babila, keep going on to the Duomo, then cross over the place to Cairoli, Cordusio and finally the castle.

They couldn't because of many reasons (most notably: lack of air superiority combined with Radar), but from purely technical point of view - they could have. Germany got bombers with a 6000 km range (eg. [Ju 290](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_290)), distance from Calais in France to northern Scotland doesn't exceed 1200km. Only problem to solve after achieving air superiority would be in making sure that British Navy doesn't get close to continental Europe. That's all they needed to land invasion and that could be done quite easily with a bit of help from [that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_in_World_War_II#Germany) ([200km range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seetakt_radar) if you're lucky) and having a bulk of their air force relocated from East to France.

&gt; bombing was not very accurate back then

We're talking here about total air superiority and Germany swiftly defeating USSR - that means Luftwaffe got more than enough bombers to nicely carpet entire cities, yet alone ports.

&gt; I mean as in they they had a hard time hitting cities forget ships,

You grossly underestimate accuracy of WW2 bombing runs if you think that hitting a city was difficult. Sure, mistakes might have happened in a tough conditions (cloud cover and wind are a major factors) but hitting cities wasn't really a problem, ports were bombed by bombers many times during WW2 - one example to give you: B-17s bombed port in Nantes.

&gt; all you would have to do is park the RN next to shore with a bunch of flak cannons aiming at the sky

Flak canons were a joke. Look up some tables showing actual loses suffered by the air forces to artillery fire - they were marginal. Fighters were a stopping power against bombers, Flak guns had mostly psychological effect.

So, why doesn't everybody just get that same exception and it's no longer an exception? Else, there's no way you can call what you are suggesting fair.

Giving a country an exception on anything because ""they're important"" would just lead to half of Europe asking for similar exception on other matters, because ""we're important, too"" and ""they got theirs, why don't we get ours?"". Sooner or later, there'd be more exceptions than rules.

If the UK is allowed to stay within the EU with some sort of special status, the EU and what it stands for (equality) is basically over. I personally believe that the UK should be stripped of it's *current* special status, and a referendum should be offered to them, where they'd decide whether they're in or out.

Then, if they stay in, they should play by the rules everyone else plays under. If not, then decision making at the European level just became much easier.

&gt;I mean we are not talking about just any country. We are talking about the country that won in the WW2. We are talking about the country where industrial revolution was born. We are talking about the country that gave to the world countless inovations.

&gt;And we are talking about the country which is one of the powers of the world, that resist the nazi Germany while everybody else capitulated.

You could play that game with almost any country and use similar ""arguments"" to justify almost anything. You're basically asking for some countries to be considered ""special"" compared to the rest, and given more privileges. This is not what the European Union is about - **equality**.

Also, the UK is not **the** country that won the WW2. Last time I checked, the USA and the Soviet Union also played a very large part, probably even larger. But that isn't even my point - I couldn't care less who was the biggest player in WW2, that was almost a century ago.

I have no idea if you're British or not, but that doesn't matter - please, *stop advocating that a country is better than another* - there's nothing special about a British person compared to any other human in the world.

The railway system is indeed well developped in Europe, and though every French person complain about it (I do it a lot) it is quite reliant and not so expensive on short distances like you will do.

I don't think it is impolite not to speak French, but i have lived in a strongly multicultural area . What i can say to you though is that if you need to speak to someone and don""t feel confident in your French, just start by asking them if they speak English : 

""Bonjour, excusez moi de vous déranger mais parlez-vous anglais s'il vous plait""

which translate roughly to ""sorry to bother you, but do you speak english please ?""

Very young program, has some organizational issues due to not having an established routine but the students I know were happy nonetheless and said the curriculum was great.

&gt;Berlin School of Mind and Brain,   

very competitive but well respected throughout germany (I applied for a PhD there and got some insight)

&gt;U Osnabrück (CogSci)  

did my bsc there. a msc in cogsci highly depends on your cogpsy interests. if you want to do something more biological,  visual attention or similar it's great (Peter König is demanding to work with but you can also learn a lot), but apart from that the institute still struggles with their psychology professorship

You did not mention Neuro-cognitive Psychology in Munich. I can highly recommend it. Has an outstanding reputation in Germany for its research focus. It strongly focuses on visual attention but you get an excellent education in research methods in general.


&gt;1) Are motivation letters for German programs pretty much similar in format and content to statement of purpose letters for US programs? Do I need to specify specific faculty members I'd like to work with?

Pretty similar, yes. You don't need to specify faculty members normally since it's ""only"" a master's and you will have lots of inevitable courses anyway.

&gt;2) How competitive are admissions? I know they're all pretty good programs (after looking through their publications and research activity), so I'm assuming competition is tough.

Out of these, the SCAN in Berlin is probably the easiest to get into as it's not that well known yet. Aceptance rates are generally between 10 and 15%.

&gt;3) What part of the application has the most weight? In the US the SOP, research exp, and recs play a big part, while in my own country, GPA and undergrad reputation are basically it. Not sure what Germany's like in general.

Motivational letter is extremely important. We like to hear that you thought about your application and why you think is program is right for you and vice versa. Also, most applications are two-step, first written and then an telephone or personal interview. These are also important.

&gt;4) Did you enjoy your time there? Was it motivating/exciting/fun (even with the usual grad student woes)? 

Yes I did and I am continuing to stay in Munich for my PhD.

there are concerts almost every day somewhere in the region. the ""garage"" that was mentioned before is seperated in two locations. one for small concerts, mainly german acts and a really big room for bigger conecert. for really big concerts you have to go to ""saarlandhalle"" or ""e-werk"" where several thousends of people fit.

I can also advice you to go to ""rocco del schlacko"" musical festival:
www.rocco-del-schlacko.de/
it's a great festival. 

as for beers you have to check the local brewerie called ""bruch"". they do a special local beer called ""zwickel"". not everybody likes it but you should at least give it a try. 
another local drink you have to try is ""viez"". it's a special kind of cider.
you should also try local foods like ""lyoner"". there are some restaurants located in the city which serve it in different variations.

Ich fühle mich Deutsch. Aber nach einer Weile, wenn jeder direkt nochmal fragt ""Nee, aber wo kommst du wirklich her?"", dann fühlt man sich einfach ausgeschlossen. Und es ist ja kein direkter Rassismus in dem Sinne. Keiner sagt ""du bist kein Deutscher"", ""du bist hier nicht wilkommen"", etc. pp. Und trotzdem ist es fast genauso schlimm finde ich. Es gibt mir das Gefühl, dass ich nie dazugehören werde. So als ob es komplett egal ist was ich tue, ich werde nie ""richtiger Deutscher"" sein. Ich weiss, es ist wirklich sehr schwierig sowas zu verstehen wenn man dem nicht selbst ausgesetzt wird. Ich habe lange darüber mit meiner deutschen Ex-Freundin geredet und eine Geschichte die ich sehr passend finde ist [diese hier](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/h0vy5/reddit_what_is_your_worst_fast_food_experience/c1rs719?context=3). Vor allem das Ende mit diesem Paragraphen:
&gt;It was the worst because I will always associate it with one of the most blatant forms of racism that I ever confronted. Granted, a stupid pun from a drunken kid is pretty innocuous, and I brush that shit off my shoulder, pretty much once a week riding the bus or the metro in dc. I know it could be a lot worse and oftentimes is for many minorities. But over the years, ive learned why it infuriated my father so much, that those snide, ignorant comments disguised as ""jokes"" represented for him a lifetime of persecution, of struggling in this country as a perceived unequal, because of his skin color, appearance, or accent. And to have that dirty reminder of second class citizenship, being passed down to his child in front of his very eyes, sullied what should have been an awesome annual trip to our favorite burger joint.

Es tut mir leid wenn ich um den heissen Brei geredet hab. Habe lange nichts mehr richtiges auf Deutsch geschrieben und habe meine Gedanken nicht wirklich geordnet. Vielleicht bin ich ja doch kein richtiger Deutscher ;).

Officials don't say anything yet but I've heard there was a 3rd force present inside during the fire. People who survived the fire said they were rushed in there when returned to the camp, basically their leaders told everyone to go hide inside instead go hide at home, and some of the bodies were found in the offices that were locked from the outside, with keys still in the door. I think no one will tell us what really happened. I think some assholes just killed a bunch of people to try and provoke unrest in the city for whatever reason.

true,Break_Your_Cycle,null,null,"Das Deutschsein ""umzudefinieren"", damit alle Menschen, die hier leben, sich als Deutsche bezeichnen können, führt nach meiner Meinung dazu, dass die deutsche Kultur unkenntlich wird und das Wort ""deutsch"" letztlich keinen Kern mehr enthält.

Das mag für einige nicht so schlimm sein, deren politische Einstellung ohnehin gegen Deutschland und die deutsche Kultur gerichtet ist.

Für andere wäre es das Ende der eigenen Herkunft, der Herkunft der Familie, der Heimat und würde das Aufgeben der eigenen Identität bedeuten.

Seit langem, noch vor 1870/1871, wurde und wird gefragt, was es eigentlich heißt, deutsch zu sein. Fasst man die Frage positiv auf, dient sie der Selbstfindung und ist nicht eindeutig zu beantworten, weil komplex, hängt aber mit der gelebten Kultur, der deutschen Geschichte, Traditionen, der Einstellung zu Deutschland und vor allem mit der deutschen Sprache zusammen.

Politisch wird die Frage nach dem ""Was ist deutsch?"" oft negativ benutzt, um vorzuführen, dass Deutschsein keinen Inhalt hat, weil es auf die Frage keine einfache Antwort gibt. Daraus schließt man dann, dass das ohnehin leere Wort ""deutsch"" auch vollkommen aufgegeben werden kann und mit dem Wort ""deutsch"" dann auch Deutschland und die Deutschen.

Fragt man Türken oder Araber oder Polen oder Russen oder Palästinenser oder Albaner oder Bosnier oder Israelis oder oder oder, dann ist die Ethnie/Nation und kulturelle Herkunft für die meisten ein sehr wichtiger Punkt für ihre eigene Zugehörigkeit, die Geschichte/Zugehörigkeit ihrer Familie und insbesondere die eigene Identität. Und das zu Recht, weil ihr Leben maßgeblich von diesen Faktoren geprägt wird.

Wandern diese Menschen in Deutschland ein, ändern sich diese Identitätsmuster nicht. Eine Veränderung der mit der Identität verbundenen Ursprungs-Kultur, der der Einwanderer zugehört und die seine Identität bestimmt, wird selten toleriert, ein Hinterfragen dieser Kultur wird oft als persönlicher Angriff gewertet. Die Sprachkultur, die Essenskultur, die Verhaltenskultur, generell die Kultur der Herkunftsländer oder der Herkunftsländer der Eltern wird selten aufgegeben, sondern bewusst beibehalten.

Von den Deutschen erwartet man jedoch, dass sie ihre eigene Identität und die eigene Kultur so erweitern, also das Deutschsein so umdefinieren, dass nun alle unter einen Schirm gefasst werden können. Damit wird aber das Deutschsein faktisch aufgegeben, weil es so stark erweitert werden müsste, dass Deutschsein keine Aussagekraft mehr hat und damit auch keine identitätsstiftenden Merkmale mehr liefern kann. 

Die Einbeziehung aller Kulturen der Welt in die deutsche Kultur führt dazu, dass das Wort ""deutsch"" nichts mehr bedeutet, weil es alles bedeuten kann.

Demgegenüber werden die Ursprungs-Kulturen der Einwanderer von diesen beibehalten und gerade nicht aufgegeben, oft sogar betont. 

Es wird also die Aufgabe der deutschen Kultur und der deutschen Identität von den Deutschen gefordert, ohne dass der Einwanderer seine eigene Identität oder Kultur aufgeben muss, damit der Einwanderer sich der deutschen Gesellschaft zugehörig fühlen kann. 

Die Migranten, die die kulturellen Bedürfnisse der Deutschen verstehen, akzeptieren und ernst nehmen, werden nach meiner Erfahrung am schnellsten aufgenommen und einbezogen, da sie fair sind und auch die andere Seite, die Seite der Aufnahmegesellschaft, sehen. 

Die Migranten, die nur ihre eigenen Bedürfnisse sehen und stets fordern, dass alles andere sich ihren Bedürfnissen anpassen muss, integrieren sich nach meiner Erfahrung eher schlecht, weil sie immer weitere Zugeständnisse fordern und das Gegenüber gar nicht wahrnehmen oder erkennen oder es sie einfach nicht interessiert, dass es da auch Bedürfnisse gibt.

Ich verstehe, das Bedürfnis von Migranten, Teil der Gesellschaft zu sein und nicht ausgeschlossen zu werden. Ich fordere aber auch von dem verständigen und fairen Einwanderer, dass er die Gesellschaft, in die er einwandert, respektiert und ihren Erhalt für wichtig erachtet. Leider sehe ich das bei den dominierenden Einwanderergruppen eher selten.

true,LordGravewish,PORT,Portugal,"Funny, how the parties that regularly criticize the EU for the 'democratic deficit' and many other issues are the ones who don't actually want to support anything that actually fixes those complaints.

Why? Because they know they'll lose (they won't win the Commission presidency), and not participating is good for populism: They can then throw their buzzwords at their constituency and continue criticizing the aforementioned 'democratic deficit'. If they thought they had any chance at winning, wouldn't the best way to oppose integration of the EU be to actually get their candidate elected to the Commission so ythey would have *actual power to change the status quo*?

Don't blame the EU for there not being any anti-EU candidate. **Blame the anti-EU parties who refuse to put forward candidates**. If there are none in your country, then go ahead and create an anti-EU party yourself. *It's not the EU's fault that there's no sane anti-EU party in your country* ^(is there a sane, i.e. not populist, anti-EU party anywhere, actually?)

Carvajal--Ramos--Pique--Alba

-----Busquets--Alonso--------

Iniesta---------------Silva

-------Pedro--Costa----------

The way Carvajal played against Bayern, I'll be shocked if he doesn't get a call up. Pique has not been having his best years at Barcelona but he tends to play very well with Spain. I would like to see Juanfran replace Pique in the back because he has had a ridiculously good season at Atletico. (But Pique is favored). The defensive midfielders; Alonso and Busquets, played well in 2010 and in 2012, I predict 2014 will go smooth as well. When Alonso got injured a couple of months ago I thought he was going to fall out off ranking in both Madrid and Spain, but his game has been completely rejuvenated. For the midfield, I think now is the time Del Bosque switches Xavi with a younger and more agile player; Silva. Xavi's game or form has not dropped much but I rank Silva as a better player right now. My thoughts; if Spain wants to go far in the World Cup they cannot keep playing the Barça or Bayern-esque way. That's why for the attack, I would put Pedro and Costa up top. Pedro would act as feeder striker and Costa purely as a finisher. (Pedro's a heck of finisher as well). Again, Spain's way to play is through their midfield and rotation. Their bench is as good as their starters.

&gt; Das Deutschsein ""umzudefinieren"", damit alle Menschen, die hier leben, sich als Deutsche bezeichnen können, führt nach meiner Meinung dazu, dass die deutsche Kultur unkenntlich wird und das Wort ""deutsch"" letztlich keinen Kern mehr enthält

klingt für mich so, als bezweifelst du, dass Menschen ""mit Migrationshintergrund"" nicht auch an der deutschen Kultur teilhaben könnten.  Ist ja ncht so, dass Migranten nur fremde Einflüsse ins Land bringen. Warum würde ein Einwanderer der sich als Deutscher bezeichnet und zumindest Teile der deutschen Kultur übernimmt, die deutsche Kultur ""unkenntlich"" machen?
Andererseits bin ich Norddeutsch, habe aber nie an Osterfeuern oder Schützenvereinsquatsch teilgenommen, bin auch kein Protestant und finde Labskaus ekelerregend. Wie weit muss man denn an der deutschen Kultur teilnehmen, bevor man  ~~den Arierausweis~~, das Gütesiegel deutsch erhält? 

&gt; Die Einbeziehung aller Kulturen der Welt in die deutsche Kultur führt dazu, dass das Wort ""deutsch"" nichts mehr bedeutet, weil es alles bedeuten kann.

Na ja, die Bedeutung Wörter verändern sich nun mal. *Die* deutsche Kultur gab es ja sowieso noch nie. Vom Morgenkaffee bis zum Bier, Fußballspiel, Keidung, Architektur über Sprache, Essen, Gewohnheiten, Religion, Goethes Italienreise, Brahms ungarische Tänze, etc... wr haben immmer schon Einflüsse von außerhalb gehabt, das was uns so wahnsinnig Urdeutsch macht, war oft lange Jahre lang nicht deutsch. 

Wir wollen Gastarbeiter - aber keine Ausländer, Glaubensfreiheit - aber keine Muslime, Döner- aber keine Türken, die Deutsche Sprache - aber kein Geld für Deutschkurse, Halloweenparties- aber ja keine Verwässerung der deutschen Kultur, Migranten, die sich integrieren - aber keine Migranten, die sich deutsch nennen.

true,plonspfetew,null,null,"Their description of the German school system with educational tracking ([geliedertes Schulsystem](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gegliedertes_Schulsystem)) is mostly correct. It is also correct that the traditional way of qualifying for university education is to attend the [Gymnasium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_%28school%29) for 13 years (or 12 years as of recently) and graduate with the [Abitur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abitur). That used to be pretty much the only way -- the Abitur was, and still often de facto is, a necessary requirement to be admitted to university.

However, university admission has been relaxed in the past few years. It is now possible -- but still not usual -- to be admitted to university without the Abitur. For example, highly trained and skilled master craftsmen can now study at universities even if they only had 10 years of secondary school education. Admission to a [Fachhochschule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fachhochschule) has been possible with the [Fachhochschulreife](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fachhochschulreife) -- a more vocational alternative to the Abitur -- for much longer. 

I am generally in favour of a decent secondary education that leads to the Abitur. I am not completely against alternative ways to get into university -- keeping talented and motivated people out would certainly be waste. However, I am quite old fashioned and idealistic in that I think that the Abitur is indeed the ideal way, at least in principle. I hate to think of universities as job-training programmes. As a lecturer, I don't want to train people for a regular job. I want to provide an academic/scientific education with a focus on research and a joy for intellectual pursuits. I am a bit sceptical about the current trend to push people into universities as a means to foster economic growth. 

However, the reality of the Abitur does not exactly match my idealism. It is indeed the case that the background of parents determines to a large extent which students end up at university and which do not. The early educational tracking seems to be partially responsible for that. That, of course, is a disgrace, and maybe alternative ways to be admitted to university can mitigate this. But I would prefer if things got fixed a lot earlier -- pretty much around age 10.",0,1399704246,null,0,false,0,chean6c,t3_256vb5,t1_chean6c,t3_256vb5,null,1433732856,28,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,28

They limit how many are on the stairs at a time and space out the groups they let in. Assuming you plan to climb up for the view, you're looking at nearly 600 steps up between Notre Dame and Sacre Coeur alone. I think it very unlikely you'll also be able to fit in Sainte Chapelle that day, though you might easily do both Notre Dame and Sainte Chapelle.

The Arc de Triomphe is another 284 stairs. People often say there is an elevator, but my experience is it is very small, doesn't go clear to the top, and they only allowed people with disabilities or the elderly on it at all the day we were there. A family with three small children was on the stairs with us trying to carry the children and two strollers between them because they were not allowed on the lift. This was probably because even with them limiting use, there was a very long line for the elevator. At least the stairs there are even, though.

I did the Arc de Triomphe, Notre Dame and Saint Severin in one day some years ago. I was pretty fit and commonly walked 150 - 175 stairs every day at work at the time. Notre Dame was still tough. The stairs are very uneven and you endlessly walk in an upward spiral. We actually thought we'd be using an elevator at the Arc de Triomphe and decided to climb the stairs anyways. Lots of leg cramping that night.

As to whether you're missing anything big, yes. So much more to Paris. You just can't do it all in four days.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed. Numbers were also removed.

*Somewhere in Europe, 19th century*

**Shady Mastermind 1:**  I say, counterpart in manipulation and foresight, how shall we further our goal of uniting Europe in peace within roughly 200 years?

**Shady Mastermind 2:** Well, most nefarious and conspiratorial bedfellow, perhaps we should use our intricate web of anarchist terror networks to instigate a war on the continent, driving the nations of Europe into a destructive frenzy the world has never seen before, a war so monumentally devastating that distrust, hatred, and stereotypes will linger for a hundred years at least.

**Shady Mastermind 1:**  But of course!  A war which we shall market as ""the War to end all Wars"", while secretly we shall already set into motion the events that will lead to a SECOND even greater war immediatly afterwards!  If we foment new nonsensical racial ideologies we can even make Caucasians turn against other Caucasians!  Surely this plan will serve to unite Europe in a way like never before.

**Shady Mastermind 2:**  Obviously the final step to this plan is having half of Europe stripped away for 40 years by a despotic Eurasian megastate with a centralized economy ostensibly based on the sharing of resources.  An economic slavery and systematic cultural persecution for decades on end by foreign powers is just what we need to set the stage for an immediate and sudden reversal in the last decade of the 20th century wherein we shall attempt to forcefully combine this shattered continent we have spent two centuries attempting to tear to shreds!

Und wie bei allen politisch korrekten Formulierungen wird es einige geben die sagen dass es übertrieben ist und andere die sagen dass es nötig ist. Ich kann es Menschen wie dir, die es wahrscheinlich wirklich nur gut meinen, nicht übel nehmen, wenn sie diese Frage stellen. Manchmal bist du halt nur der Tropfen der das Fass zum überlaufen bringt. Aber eigentlich ist das ja mein Problem. Ich glaube bei mir würde schon die Wortauswahl einen riesen Unterschied machen. ""Wo kommst du wirklich her?"" impliziert irgendwie dass ICH nicht wirklich aus Deutschland kommen kann. Stattdessen fände ich ""Wo kommst du her"" ""Deutschland"" ""Ah wow wirklich? Stört es dich wenn ich frage wo deine Eltern herkommen?"" passender. Ich weiß es klingt sehr pingelig. Und du musst ja auch nicht auf mich hören, ich bin keineswegs repräsentiv.

true,deliber,null,null,"This already is a good answer to OP's question. I would like to add a few points.

1.) Most importantly, the German system has established a way for people without an Abitur (i.e. those who went to school for 9 or 10 years) to get another kind of degree. It's called an Ausbildung. You can do you Ausbildung in many different fields, e.g, as an craftsman, banker, merchant, nurse, and so on. Most of these do not require Abitur. An Ausbildung combines a practical aspect, which means you work in the business for four days a week (to pick a number), and an educational aspect, which means you go to a special type of school for one day a week. After three years, you are awarded a diploma and become a full-time worker, either at the same business where you got the Ausbildung, or at another business. It is very important to note that, while there of course is a status hierarchy between university graduates and people with an Ausbildung, that an Ausbildung is not necessarily worse than an university degree. There are a lot of people with Abitur that opt for an Ausbildung, although they could in theory go to university. The Ausbildung system is *very* popular – it's just a thing you do after finishing school. In my book, this is one of the great strengths of the German system: It provides an alternative to the scholarly university degrees for people who really want to get to do stuff. 

2.) The German system is very complex. That might be why the family that OP met didn't mention all the flexibilities and possibilities in the German system. That is, while you have to pick at the age of 10 for the first time, there is mobility in both directions: If you are very good at the 10-year school, you can move up to the 12/13-year school (and vice-versa). Also, many students with an degree from the 10-year school continue their education on the 12/13-year school, in the end getting their Abitur after all.",0,1399714583,null,0,false,0,checdys,t3_256vb5,t1_checdys,t1_chean6c,null,1435494255,11,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,11

Yes, and German law has a very strict definition of when it is to be used:

- Germany is under direct attack on the own land
- A military alliance partner (NATO) is under attack
- An international mandate, by the UN calling for aggressive military action

&gt; The obvious implication here is that Germany has a responsibility to contribute when military force is that only option.

Which leaves two questions open:

1. Who and how is it determined that military intervention is called for?
2. In which circumstances can Germany be called responsible to participate?

For example Germany is a member of NATO, which means that it's mandated to intervene should any other NATO member be under attack. However this alliance call for action is not without problems as well: There are *accusations* against Turkey (also a member of NATO) to having attempted to actively trigger an open war between Turkey and Syria, which subsequently would have forced Germany to participate.

What you are describing is the ""dreigliedrige"" system. Students go to primary school for 4 years. After that they get a recommendation for the next school the teachers think they are most qualified to. In most (all?) states the last decision rests with the parents.

There are three schools: The gymnasium, 8 or 9 years long, depending on the state, which is for students who want to go to university afterwards and study to become an engineeer, doctor, teacher etc. If you go to a gymnasium you will study at least two foreign languages, sometimes three, have several years of biology, physics, chemistry and everybody will learn mathematics up to and including calculus.

In a realschule the students will learn one or two foreign languages and mathematics up to and including precalculus. 

In a hauptschule the students will learn one foreign language, English, and the niveau of the language skills will be rather low. You won't starve in an English speaking country but you probably won't ever read a book in the language. Students learn basic mathematics.

It is not true, that you can't switch. In a hauptschule there is often a werkrealschule which let's you take the test for the Mittlere Reife, which you get when you pass the end exam of the realschule.
You can switch from the realschule to the gymnasium if your grades are very good and you do take two languages. Or you can go to another school after you get your Mittlere Reife and take the exam for an Abitur.

In the last few years it has been made easier to go to university without an Abitur, if you have succesfully completed your ausbildung and worked a few years in your chosen job.

Also, the system is different in Germany, a lot of jobs you need a college degree for in the US, you won't need one in Germany. Mittlere Reife is good enough. You go to professional school and work in a company while you go there to get some hands on experience, take a test at the end and your done. You can be an accountant, a software developer, kindergarten teacher, nurse etc. without ever seeing the inside of a college or university. 

So even if you don't go to college, you don't have to be stuck in a low paying job.

It is true that if your parents have a college degree your chance to go to college is higher. If your parents have Abitur, your chance to go to gymnasium is higher. If your parents have Mittlere Reife, your chance to go to realschule is higher. But about a third of the students go to a more demanding school than there parents did.

And at the same time the EU gradually expanded its membership to 22 new countries. We went from a position of being 1/6 of the total membership to 1/28. This, as you can see, is quite the difference. Don't you say?

And all of this, even the Euro, happened **without** a referendum. No one in NL gave its consent to a common currency, one market etc..

But then it was 2006! And the European Leader were discussing a European constitution. And this time we had a politician who thaught he should ask the people what they want before turning us into a province of Europe. The referendum was held. **[61,5% of the Dutch voted against the constitution.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_European_Constitution_referendum,_2005)**. 

Then they took 98% of the constitutions' text, called it the Lisbon Treaty, and passed it without a referendum. 

And now we are part of a transfer-union, most of or laws get made at EU level, we can't change immigration or financial policy on our own, the ECB has to print money to keep southern Europe alive...

true,vernazza,HUNG,Glorious Workers' Democracy by Viktor,"This is just one half of the story. The other one is even worse. There are two state funds of Norway, one is the here mentioned, EU-mandated grant system funded by Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein which is quite similar to the ""regular"" EU grant system. The bickering on this one is about how Hungary unilaterally decided to entirely change the grant monitoring process, making it far more opaque to the Norwegians than before.

The second fund is the Norwegian Civil Fund, which gives grants to civil organizations in far lesser amounts than the first one, usually just tens of thousands of Euros. They were accused by State Minister János Lázár not long before the elections to illegally fund the green party, LMP, through granting ~20m Fts (about 70k€) to an NGO they claim is borderline fake and has close ties to the LMP leadership. This comes from the very party whose election campaign was a good 50% done by an """"""NGO"""""" who refuses to answer how did they manage to find 6-7 million Euros for the billboard adverts throughout the country. 

Basically Fidesz realized that if they keep themselves to the original EU granting-contract that was in place since we joined in 2004, they really cannot fish in murky waters because they'll get caught at the audit. So they changed the audit process itself without any consultation with Norway (who funds 97% of the whole thing, the other 3% is from Iceland and Liechtenstein). And they are being cocky about it, demanding ""respect"" and went as far as demanding the government gets consulted on who the winners should be and what types of grants should be given. Yes, ""consulted"", read: they want to decide that as well. 

This is our ridiculous reality as our leaders get offended that some countries do not accept that they want to fill their pockets as thick as possible, so instead they kick them out alltogether.

&gt; Hahaha. Oui, et qu'est-ce qui serait différent entre la BCE et la banque de France ?
&gt; Le taux directeur est le taux de refinancement des banques. Par contre, le ""rendement"" dont tu parles n'a strictement rien à voir. Quand la BCE baisse son taux (aujourd'hui à 0,25%), ça incite les banques à se financer auprès d'elle, mais ça ne ""garantie"" rien du tout, au contraire.

Les taux directeurs n'ont aucune influence sur les taux d'intérets !?
C'est totalement faux, encore une fois tu racontes des bétises... Les taux directeurs ont aussi une énorme influence sur le marché des change, juste pour info.

&gt; Ce n'est pas la finance qui fait la loi. C'est l'économie réelle qui fait la finance. Mais évidemment, quand on est un soumis et un vaincu comme toi, on ne peut même pas imaginer faire peur aux pauvres petits marchés.

Mais jouer les amateurs de cette maniere te fera perdre beaucoup de credibilité face a tes créanciers, souveraineté de la France ou pas, ils ne te preteront plus rien, c'est la loi du marché.


&gt; Il n'y a aucune logique dans ce que tu dis. Le défaut viendrait d'une initiative d'État, pas des créanciers qui refuseraient des conditions.

Relis tes bases, tu n'y connais pas grand chose la dessus: http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9faut_souverain

Un défaut souverain est le fait pour un gouvernement ou un État souverain de ne pas payer entièrement sa dette.
**Si des prêteurs potentiels ou des souscripteurs d'obligations d’État commencent à soupçonner que l’État pourrait ne pas rembourser sa dette, ils réclament un haut taux d'intérêt, une prime en compensation du risque de défaut.**


&gt; Les taux des emprunts déjà souscrits ne changent pas. Les conditions des emprunts déjà souscrits ne changent pas non plus.
&gt; Il n'y a rien à négocier.

En cas de deval je suis d'accord, pas en cas de sortie de l'Euro

&gt; Absolument pas. Il montre que la dette publique se réduit en deux ans. Se réduit drastiquement d'ailleurs. Paragraphe E, graphique 7.

Encore une fois, tu n'as pas lu mon lien
Sapir admet que ce ne sont que des pures hypotheses et qu'en realité, on ne sait pas pour sur ce qui pourrait se passer vu le scenario catastrophe que cela pourrait engender:

&gt; Mais le même insiste sur l’aspect «très virtuel» du débat. Ne serait-ce que parce qu’une sortie de la France de l’euro... impliquerait probablement la disparition de l’euro, et que les problèmes se poseraient alors dans d’autres termes. «C’est une approche théorique et de peu d’importance au regard des bouleversements qui interviendraient dans un pareil scénario», ajoute-on au Trésor. Une conversion forcée de la dette publique en nouveaux francs, possible juridiquement, ne peut être isolée de ses conséquences : défiance des investisseurs, explosion des taux d’intérêt (et donc potentiellement de la dette à venir). Jacques Sapir en convient. Ouvrant un autre débat, il estime que la France devrait alors trouver un moyen de ne plus faire appel aux marchés internationaux. Et tous de s’accorder que ce débat juridique, posé par Apparu et Philippot, n’éclaire que très partiellement les enjeux d’une sortie de l’euro

Alors évite d'assener cela comme la Vérité et demonstration mathematique. Ce ne sont que des hypotheses virtuels.

Hinzu kommt, dass einem die Selbstversorgung genauso wie die Eigenständigkeit verdammt schwer gemacht wird.

Diese ganzen Tatsachen machen einen Ausstieg aus Gesellschaft und Arbeitszwang sehr, sehr schwierig.

Se il vincolo delle risorse non esistesse non ci sarebbe nemmeno bisogno di una classe politica (o di dirigenti preparati nelle aziende), basterebbe gettare risorse a caso contro i problemi.

The Poles won't shut up about Katyn, didn't they notice that they were liberated from facists? And so forth.

The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed. Numbers were also removed.

Hollande's promises count:

Done: 96
In-doing or partly done: 35
Broken: 46
Not yet acted on (either for or against) but still planned: 229

If you limit to his 60 campaign promises (what he was elected on), the numbers become (larger than 60 because they cut larger promises into each point to be able to judge):

Done: 45
In-doing or partly done: 15
Broken: 6
Not yet acted on (either for or against) but still planned: 88

You can get the details for each promises by exploring the site. Overall this is a far better ratio than a lot of president in a lot of countries, including some previous recent french presidents.

But I guess it's easier to jump on the bandwagon of ""he does not do what he promised"". He has a lot he can be criticized with, but next time you give it a try don't go with a statement that's wrong. He did more than half of what he promised during his campaign already.

true,nolok,FRAN,France,"France is going through a rough political time where both political sides have consolidated, so we don't have large center or center-left or center-right parties anymore, only one left (PS), one right (UMP) and a constellation of small center, far left and far right parties. The right unified on purpose, the left more because every one else decayed to the point of irrelevance (like the former strong communist party). Last presidential election we still had the ecologist on the left and a decent sized center party but they both exploded due to shitty internal competition and mis-management.

The left party made a primary election before the presidential election, and a center was elected (Hollande), but as a result of the large party size which covers the whole left spectrum, a big amount of left voters don't recognize themselves in Hollande and believe he's not doing a real left policy.

And the right don't like his center policies either because, well, they're not liberal enough, but at the same time because he's center and not really left they mock him for being non-left. That doesn't make sense but eh, politics.

If you look at [my other answer to the parent](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/256uyu/french_president_publicly_endorses_the/chefakf), you'll see Hollande has actually already fulfilled more than half of his campaign promises. But facts like that don't change that people don't feel like they fit with his views, so they ignore it.

Don't get me wrong; he's not a ""great"" president, but he's not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be. It's merely that not one feels like he's the one they wanted, even those that voted for him. And the fact that this is true despite him keeping more promises than not shows how bad the situation is. I'm usually center left and I don't feel satisfied with him, he's too center. But any candidate lefter than him was far left, nothing in between.

If you wonder why do a primary election then, it's because they didn't in 2002, and they ended up with several left candidates against a solidified right, and the left which has more votes overall in the first turn had no candidates on the second turn (which ended up being between right UMP and far-right FN). So, not much better, and jut goes to show both sides have to de-consolidate at the same time to fix anything.

That political spectrum issue is also a large part of the growing far right party, ""Front National"", with a lot of people who don't see themselves in the two parties anymore and want something else (the other parties beside FN have an historical habit to line up behind UMP or PS at election time).

The best thing that could happen to France now, would be an explosion of PS and UMP in two or three parties each, along with the coming proportional representation in parliament that Hollande promised and still plan to do for 2017. Then people will have more of a chance to pick something that match their views.",0,1399730864,null,0,1399731426,0,cheffyd,t3_256uyu,t1_cheffyd,t1_cheeb1n,null,1433735183,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Equally, the proportion who would vote to leave is six points lower in Scotland. While that difference is potentially enough to alter the majority outcome, it is not enough to suggest that there is a far stronger groundswell in favour of the European project north of the border.

true,db_voy,null,null,"After the 4th grade you have to choose. (Earlier there has been a different school in grade 5 and 6 that ought to help you decide which one of the three to pic but they changed that).

Kids from rich families are expected by their parents to have a good education, so they will surely pic the higher one.

Kids from worker families traditionally pic the lowest one because their parents want them to go the same way and pic a job as a craftsman for example. But its not unusual that their kids are sent to higher schools so they can do better in life than their parents.

It is always possible to ""upgrade"". Some friends of mine went to ""Hauptschule"" (the lowest one) up to grade 9 and then visited grade 10 in the ""Realschule"" (middle one) to get a better degree. My wife first went to Realschule and after that visited ""Gymnasium"" (the highest one).

If you want to go to university you need ""Abitur"", the exam from the ""Gymnasium"". Although you can do that later in life, if you visit an eveneing school for example. You can do the other exams there as well (after a certain time of school).

There is a thing called ""Hochschule"" or ""Fachhochschule"", which is a kind of universitiy that has got a less theoretic and more practical way of teaching. This can be visited if you went to school for ten years (Realschule or Gymnasium) and have got good notes.

You are also allowed to visit this University after you made your apprenticeship diploma if your school was good enough.

As for the poor / rich thing: Rich kids are often visiting better schools because their parents can afford private tutoring and the parents are better educated so they can help better with the homwork. Also poor parents have to work more / longer so they cannot be there to help that much (these are only some possible reasons).

I went to Gymnasium and my parents were not rich. Some of my classmates were from similar families, some had much more money.

There are some different ways to get educated. For example, there is the ""Gesamtschule"", in which all pupils are educated together but can do all exams from the three schools (Hauptschuel/Realschule/Gymnsium).

Firstly, the lyrics are the most profound out of all the songs. It's about consumerism and how someone has it all yet still wants more. they feel unfulfilled so they resort to wanting something obtainable that ironically doesn't come from having money.

not to mention that they sing in their own language which, as an english person, is something i really like and isn't common in the eurovision contest this year.

I know their song seems cheesy but it's musically different to most of the others - a lot of the other songs have a softly played piano at a slow beat with a ""heartfelt"" vocal performance that lacks any real emotion.

the song is also upbeat which is something you'd want when watching a song contest of this nature.

the chorus gets annoying after a few listens BUT it should be perfect for its ideal demographic (not me but teenagers) and the verse is also musically alright.

Or exporting of goods, the EU is our biggest importer of good made in Scotland, we receive billions of £s from those exports, surely they will suffer with an increase of exporting costs to the continent in the form of duty prices.

Genau. Ist es. Auch die Hashtagaktivistinnen, Feministinnen und Tumblrinas sind vollkommen besessen von ihrem Thema, der vermeintlichen strukturellen Unterdrückung der Frauen in der Gesellschaft. Alles, was sie sehen, wird durch diesen Filter wahrgenommen und interpretiert.

Hier ein relevanter Ausschnitt aus einem Text, den der Wissenschaftstheoretiker Karl Popper über Leute geschrieben hat, die eine neue Theorie für sich entdecken (in seinem Fall u.a. Marxisten): 
&gt; ""These theories appeared to be able to explain practically everything that happened within the fields to which they referred. The study of any of them seemed to have the effect of an intellectual conversion or revelation, opening your eyes to a new truth hidden from those not yet initiated. Once your eyes were thus opened you saw confirming instances everywhere: the world was full of verifications of the theory. Whatever happened always confirmed it. Thus its truth appeared manifest; and unbelievers were clearly people who did not want to see the manifest truth; who refused to see it, either because it was against their class interest, or because of their repressions which were still 'un-analysed' and crying aloud for treatment.""

Ähnlich ergeht es unseren Feministinnen und Social Justice Warriors. Sie sehen überall nur noch Sexismus und Rassismus und fühlen sich als Avantgarde, die den noch Unerleuchteten ihre problematischen Verhaltensweisen vorhalten. Die eigenen Überzeugungen werden zu einem Kult, Abweichler werden mit einem Bann belegt und gemieden. Die Beziehungen zu ""normalen"" Freunden werden vergiftet, da die Einseitigkeit und Selbstgerechtigkeit dieser Leute schwer zu ertragen ist.

I think the Cold War is one of those periods of history where the debate over what happened is *particularly* polarised. This is partly due to one entire perspective being almost completely blank. The Soviets didn't minute meetings like Western democracies did, so even after it collapsed, historians had to make educated guesses as to what was happening based on fragments of evidence. I could place the blame for any big event in Cold War history on any of four things using almost identical evidence. 

For instance, I could

*  blame the Cuban Missile Crisis on Kennedy's and formerly Eisenhower's aggressive behaviour, and Khrushchev (leader of the USSR) only intervened to protect a tiny little ally. 

* Or I could interpret Khrushchev as jumping on any opportunity to put missiles near the United States and Castro merely happened to be there. 

* Or even place the blame entirely on Castro, by forcing the great powers to fight against each other and securing his own position (we know that his *political ally*, Che Guevara, wasn't particularly scared of nuclear war).

*  Or you could argue a nuanced post-revisnionist perspective which places the blame on both sides equally (there's all sorts of different post-revionist interpretations).

 These four interpretations of one event are actively argued even today, and all have a lot of legitimacy.  

Additionally, the interpretation of the Cold War is deeply effected by current events, more so than most fields of history because of how relatively near all of the Cold War is. Interpretations of the USA's roll 1945-65 shifted from largely positive pre Vietnam to largely negative after Vietnam reached its apex. Likewise, Russia's roll in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus , particularly now that Ukraine is flaring up, will lead to a shift in the interpretations of the USSR's roll in the Cold War to largely negative because historians will be inspired by current events and their similarities with those in the past. 

Don't let this stop you watching the documentary. I'm sure it's a great documentary, but just remember that it will be giving its own interpretation of the Cold War, and that its interpretation is almost certainly the subject of fierce historical debate.

Keine wirklich aussagende Antwort. Man merkt, sie würde gerne etwas christlich-konservatives sagen, aber getraut sich nicht mal das. Was herauskommt, ist ""Man muss an die Kinder zuallererst denken"", wenn man die Konsequenz aus dieser Denke zieht (also keine Adoption), ist sie der Meinung, dass Homosexuelle keine Kinder adoptieren dürfen, weil sie einen schlechten Einfluss auf das Kind hätten. Mehr noch als aufwachsen im Heim. Muss man sich mal auf der Zunge zergehen lassen.

Das war eine Sache. NSA-Affäre eine weitere. Ich erinnere an 2008, als Merkel durch Deutschland reiste um die ""Bildungsrepublik"" zu promoten. Also ich weiss nicht, ob hier irgendjemand in letzter Zeit mal in einer Schule war, aber in 6 Jahren hat sich fast nichts getan. Okay, kann man sagen, ist Ländersache. Gut. Aber da waren noch andere solche Projekte. 2007? Klimaschutz an erster Stelle. Juhu! Sie redete anderen Staatschefs ins Gewissen. Vorbildlich. Und nun? Deutschland nummer 1 beim Ausstoss von Co2 in Europa. 2013. Nice. 2003 hiess es noch, die Sozialversicherungen werden reformiert. Mal ehrlich: es ist an der Zeit. Seit 11 Jahren. Die Meinung war mal, dass zukünftige Generationen (also wohl die meisten hier) nichts oder zumindest nur wenig aufgebürdet werden soll. Was gibt es? Ausgewählte Rente ab 65 (zwar nur für ein sehr ausgewähltes Klientel, aber Kosten sind Kosten), Mütterrente... ok, klar, das sind Geschenke an die SPD. Aber dann könnte man wenigstens trotzdem auf eine vernünftige Reformierung pochen? Stattdessen: Nichts.

Natürlich kommt man so gut weg. Es gibt keine Möglichkeit, nicht gut wegzukommen, wenn sich auch einfach nichts verschlechtert weil man nichts macht. Der Willen, etwas neues anzupacken und ernsthaft zu gestalten, fehlt fast komplett (und das bei der *ganzen* Regierung der GroKo...)

 2- E' impossibile trovare i finanziamenti che ti consentirebbero di investire su un'idea vincente, perche' visto il punto 1 (e la quantita' enorme di cialtroni a giro) nessuno si fida.

 3- Infrastrutture pessime, burocrazia, costi enormi sia per le tasse che per la logistica e i servizi.

Vitoria's got a nice old town.

Donostia is really beautiful but really pricey, whilst Bilbao is more fun and affordable, but it's not quite what you'd call a ""monumental city"".

Officially - yes. Practically - Ukraine is trying to do that now.

&gt;&gt;Whereas people in Russia and Belarus are trying to bring the whole thing back.

&gt;They want some kind of a union, but not soviet and not socialistic.

They have been in a union [for a very long time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_State) with [even more to come](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Union).

&gt;&gt;Coincidently, Belarus and Ukraine were many years longer under the Russia's rule, and the results of that are still seen now.

&gt;Russia, Ukraine and Belarus are inhabited by East Slavs. Might be related.

Not really. Polish are slavs but they are free. It has more to do with how these nations perceive Russia - ones who perceive Russia as brothering country with which they have strong historic and cultural relations now are in a deep shithole. Those who don't, now are free.

&gt;&gt;And if propaganda in Russia continues, what are its chances of having a democratic country?

&gt;I would argue that Russia was actually moving towards democracy in 90s. So it might be cyclical.

Just because you're not in the EU doesn't mean your government isn't subjected to certain influences. The same thing that is happening in Norway is happening throughout Western Europe. Otherwise your government wouldn't ''fund'' foreign leftist groups.

&gt;You sound like a complete fool claiming Norway's buying influence in Hungary.
&gt;Listen, it fails to qualify as imperialism because it in NO WAY extends Norway's power and influence in Hungary. 

&gt;
 Hungarian organizations working for Hungary's society **is not giving Norway anything at all**! It's building Hungary for Hungarians.

Of course it doesn't. It aids the EU establishment and those in power. 

&gt;There is no ""left wing"" focus as you claim. When will you get that central fact? 

Because promoting ''social justice'' and so called ''minority rights'' isn't a leftist stance at all right?!

&gt;P.S. Norway is currently ruled by Conservative right-wing coalition government.

You mean neo-cons who are pretty much identical to all other ''conservative'' parties in Europe?

I wasn't accusing Norway as a nation of being imperialist, I was accusing your and by extension many other governments in Europe.

true,philip_oliver_holes,null,null,"No problem, I hope this little bit of info helps you make your study abroad plans.

1) I live in a homestay within Madrid.  My apartment is around the Atocha area, just south of Parque del Retiro, and I live with a woman and her 16 year old son.

1a) As far as homestay vs. apartment, both have advantages and disadvantages, and I know people in each.  A homestay is ideal for experiencing more genuine Spanish culture.  My senora doesn't speak any English, so it's a great way to practice and improve my Spanish.  Also she cooks for me, so I get tasty, authentic homecooked Spanish meals, which I really like.  The downside is that I don't have the freedom/ability to pregame at my apartment with friends and stuff like that.  That is really not a big deal though because there are plenty of places to drink around Madrid, and since I do know people who have apartments, we go there from time to time.  Drinking in public at parks and in plazas (it's called botellon) is also pretty popular and I've never had any problems with the police or anything like that.  Most people I know have been happy with whichever living arrangement they are in.  If you want a little bit more freedom and don't want to speak Spanish often, an apartment would probably be good, but if you'd rather practice Spanish and learn more about the culture, a homestay is probably better.

1b) Commuting to UC3M (Leganes campus -- there are three) is a little bit annoying, but I don't mind it too much.  To get from my apartment door to the classroom door: I walk to the metro stop, take the metro 2 stops to a station where the Renfe (commuter trains that go farther outside of Madrid than the metro) comes, transfer onto the Renfe and take that to Leganes, and then walk 5-10 minutes from the train station to campus.  In total, it takes me almost an hour.  I've gotten used to it though, and it is very common here for students to live in Madrid and take the train to campus every day.  I know one kid who lives north of the city and it takes him 2 hours each way every day.

2) As far as European cities go, Madrid is really affordable.  Lots of other places like Barcelona, Paris, London, and everywhere in Italy are significantly more expensive than Madrid in my experience.  It's hard to give you a cost figure because you can be frugal and live pretty cheaply, or you can travel a lot, buy expensive drinks at the clubs, etc. and spend a fortune.  It really depends on how well you budget and are responsible.  You can drink for really cheap by buying beer/wine/liquor at corner stores (alimentacion) and pregaming wherever or by going to bars that have like 1-2 euro pints before going somewhere more expensive, or you can go to Kapital and buy drinks at like 12 euro each and go broke.

3) Nightlife in Madrid is really good, and Spaniards are pretty wild.  You can go out most days of the week if you want.  Spaniards also eat dinner really late at like 9 or 10pm, and for that reason they go out really late as well.  Clubs don't even start to fill up until 12 or 1am, and people commonly stay out until 6am.  There's also definitely something for everyone.  There are big clubs (discotecas) like Kapital, Pacha, Joy, and Shoko.  There are tons of cool bars all around.  Two of my favorites are Chapandaz and Public House.  Some neighborhoods (barrios) are known for having lots of good bars, and it's pretty easy to figure that type of stuff out once you're here.  A few chain places (Cien Montaditos, La Surena) have really good deals some days of the week.  There's a good number of hookah places too if that's your thing.  Since I don't live at UC3M campus in Leganes, I don't know what effect that would have.

Hope this helps.  Let me know if you think of anything else.

true,Hirnsuppe,null,null,"Nö, ist mir absolut nicht unangenehm; ich habe überlegt, ob ich dir darauf antworten sollte, habe dann aber beschlossen, dass diese persönliche Information über mich hier nichts zur Sache tut, weil ich eine objektive Diskussion des Themas bevorzuge, zumal ich sie sonst als sinnlos betrachten würde. Ich wünsche keine von dir subjektiv veranstaltete Analyse meiner Person, denn das Thema hier ist gesellschaftlicher Natur.

Ich kann dir durchaus zustimmen, dass es irgendwo auf dieser Welt sicher noch den einen oder anderen Fleck geben wird, auf dem ich legal fernab aller Gesellschaft leben KANN - hypothetisch zumindest. Diese Flecken aber ernsthaft in Betracht zu ziehen, ist im Grunde nicht wesentlich absurder, als diesen ganzen menschlichen Affenzirkus diesseits der Realität irgendwie zumindest am Rand mitzumachen - weil da draußen nichts mehr ist. Es gibt so gut wie gar keinen Fleck bewirtschaftbarer Welt mehr da draußen, das nicht wenigstens oder sogar hauptsächlich bürokratisch von Menschen besessen, benutzt und verwaltet wird. Außer am Grunde des Meeres oder in völlig unbewohnbaren Gegenden ist vielleicht noch ein Platz frei. Hurra. Da kann ich mich auch gleich selbst umbringen. In dieser von zu vielen Menschen besessenen Welt kann man sich nur noch einen Platz KAUFEN - und das macht den Zwang aus, dem man ausgeliefert ist, noch bevor man geboren wird im Grunde. Da fängt der Zwang zumindest schon an, in Wahrheit ist es noch ein Bisschen ärgerer, denn es führt über kurz oder lang dazu, dass wenige Menschen viele Menschen besitzen, die für sie alle zusammen zu wenig vorhandene Welt bewirtschaften. Profitieren tun davon natürlich die Wenigen, denen die vielen Menschen gehören, die diese Wirtschaft leisten und als registrierte Einheiten von ihnen bürokratisch verwaltet werden. 

Und natürlich habe ich meinen Körper, um arbeiten zu können. Er ist mit ein paar besonderen Werkzeugen ausgestattet, ein paar davon benutze ich sogar indes, um mit dir hier zu schreiben. Mein Körper ist ein Tier und wie jeder Tierkörper besitzt er die Fähigkeit zur Fortbewegung und zur Ausübung von Maßnahmen, sich Nahrung, Unterschlupf und Evolutionspartner zu beschaffen. Von Natur aus tue ich das für mich und für diejenigen, mit denen ich zusammen lebe. Dies ist die animalische Definition von Freiheit - und da, wo sie mir genommen wird, beginnt ein Zwang. Es geht nicht darum, nicht etwas für andere tun zu wollen, sondern darum, für wen man es tut und unter welchen Bedingungen. Die Bedingungen sind meistens nicht als sehr gut zu empfinden, wenn man sich mit einer Quittung für seine gestohlene Zeit in Form von Geldscheinen aus Papier seine Nahrung und alles andere beschaffen muss, denn diese Zeit wird einem sehr intensiv entzogen, das merkt jeder von uns am stärksten morgens, wenn der Wecker klingelt, schätze ich. Und so gehst du los mit deiner Kolone in euren dreckigen Hosen und mit euren rauen Händen und euren kaputten Rücken und euren unausgeschlafenen Hirnen und Mägen und baut Paläste, in denen ihr nie wohnen werdet. Aber hey, für die Zeit, die man euch dafür gestohlen habt, bekommt ihr eine Quittung, die könnt ihr weiter reichen, Wohlstand bleibt bei mir, geb ich dann dem was, von dem du dein Essen und deine Sachen kaufst. In Wahrheit kommt davon da nie wirklich was an, anderswo auf der Welt wird den Menschen die Zeit noch viel härter gestohlen, die bekommen die Quittung, die du mal für deine gestohlene Zeit bekommen hast, als letztes in die Hand gedrückt, nachdem sie schon durch viele andere Hände gegangen ist, und dann ist sie fast gar nix mehr wert. Diejenigen, die den meisten Reichtum produzieren, sind die Ärmsten. Man arbeitet nicht für sich, man arbeitet für andere.

So PS goes with a center-oriented person, trying to grab center people from UMP since they have nothing to fear on the left.

And UMP goes to the far right, trying to stop their erosion on that side which is much much quicker than whatever PS can take from center (where Borloo even made UDI a couple years ago to create a ""wall"", a party which then side between UMP on everything once it made sure of getting the votes of more center oriented people).

And people get fed up and vote FN, which is the only one of decent size not siding with a big one every time.

That ultimately leads to more right oriented politics, yes, but the reason for that are merely political strategy, not the vision regular voters actually wants. I mean if you're in the left, the only two serious votes you can make are either for PS (center) or FN (far right). And if you're right, it's UMP (right) or FN (far right).

It is. I actually never questioned the order of parties on our ballot papers although I knew it makes a difference.

Small fun fact section to this:

- More people vote if weather is good. So ""bad weather"" is indeed a valid explanation for a (slightly) worse voter turnout.

- Often people just vote for a party because they were the strongest party in polls before and these people want to be on the ""winner-side""

- And finally, order on the paper ballot **does** matter. Some people just tend to vote for the first name/party in a list, no matter which one it is.
