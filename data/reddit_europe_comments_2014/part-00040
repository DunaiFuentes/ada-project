* Don't rent a car while staying in Barcelona. It is a pain with parking and driving in and out of the city. And you can't really use it in the city either, metro is way more efficient. 
* Bring or rent a GPS.
* Make sure to rent a car from one of the big companies. The worst company around is Gold Car, avoid at all costs. 
* If you want to leave the country (Andorra is another country, something that is often overlooked), make sure you get this in the contract.
* Rent a small car so you can find parking for it (I drive a van, VERY hard to find parking space).
* When driving on highways, prepare to pay quite a lot. Go to the manual lane and pay with credit card. If they don't accept the card you can always pay with cash, something that is not possible if you go to the machines.
* Check the age limit and years of experience before.
* There are only manual gearbox available.

We only book cars for groups so can't really say prices but I always send my clients to [RentalCars.com](http://www.rentalcars.com/Home.do?affiliateCode=activespain_rc&amp;preflang=en&amp;country=Spanien+-+Fastland) and use it myself when renting while traveling, I find they have good prices.

true,Onidracy,null,null,"If you are going to spend a full week in Barcelona, I recommend spending one full day using the ""Bus Turistic"" (link: http://www.barcelonabusturistic.cat/en/home). This will allow you to cover all main touristic places in one day, and to be honest it´s a great way to move through Barcelona as well,a s you can use it as any other bus, but the route is just from monument to monument.

As far as touristic places, you need to check Parc Guell, Sagrada Familia, Port Olimpic and the surrounding areas/beaches, Barri Gotic, Camp Nou (best team of the world! :P), all the Montjuic area, and of course walk through Ramblas and Paseo de Gracia. I´d also recommend Tibidabo, the other mountain :), and around Arc de Triomf area and the parc de la ciutadela. 

As I´m a local, I´ve lost track of what is considered touristic nowadays, but I´d also recommend walking around Born and Eixample (mainly because it´s a very nice area and you get to see that all Barcelona buildings are really beautifully designed). 
As you have some time, I also recommend going to Montserrat, and if you find time, to Cadaqués, for me one of the most beautiful villages in the world. There you can also visit Salvador Dali´s house. The only thing is it´ll take you a full day to do Cadaqués, as it´s a 2 hours by car (3 by bus) drive from Barcelona (so in one day 6 hours driving). In case you´d be interested, I leave here the link from the buses that drive there: http://www.sarfa.com/paginas/sarfa_portada.php?id_idioma=3

What else... As you are coming here in march, I recommend trying out the ""Calçotada"". It´s like giant onions with a superb sauce. Very traditional on these dates. You can also go eat tapas at the Cervecería Catalana or Ciudad Condal, both from the same owners, which I really recommend. But most of the places around Rambla Catalunya are fairly good. 

No idea what sort of party people you are, but even if you just like it chill, you can go have some drinks around Born or Santalo area, and especially around Santalo area, then visit a night club. The Gran de Gracia area is also awesome to go out, and if you like rock music and cheap beer, around Marina area you have great clubs.

Portal del angel has also nice stores and walking around the little streets there you can find very interesteing little stores. I used to love carrer Tallers and around, as they had very unique stores. Nowadays it´s rather ""fashion"", but still nice to visit. It´s very close to Plaza Catalunya, which is at the top of Ramblas.

I think for now you have quite a few ideas, but if you have any questions, don´t hesitate to ask away! 
Oh, and please, please, please, don´t be careless and watch your stuff, especially around touristic areas. Barcelona has quit skilled pickpockers, so watch your stuff :)

Flip flops are the only shoes that scream ""tourist"". Basically everything else should be fine.

San Servolo is an island (I mean literally) basically inhabitated by foreign students. When you'll visit the main part of Venice, there will be thousands of Americans on the streets, so you won't be neither the only one, nor the first.

 [**Rigatoni con la Pajata**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigatoni%20con%20la%20Pajata): 

---

&gt;**Rigatoni con la Pajata** (in [Italian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Language): **Rigatoni con la Pagliata**) is a classic dish of the [Roman Cuisine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Cuisine). The dish can be found in some traditional [trattorias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trattoria) in Rome. Pajata is the term for the intestines of an ""un-weaned"" calf, i.e., only fed on its mother's milk. The intestines are cleaned and skinned, but the [chyme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chyme) is left inside. Then the intestine is cut in pieces 20 – 25 cm long, which are bound together with white thread, forming rings. When cooked, the combination of heat and the enzyme [rennet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennet) in the intestines coagulates the chyme and creates a sort of thick, creamy, cheese-like sauce. These rings can be served simply seasoned and grilled (pajata arrosto) or in the traditional Roman dish in which pajata is stewed in a typical [tomato sauce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato_sauce) and served with [rigatoni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigatoni).

true,elphieLil84,sardegna,,"A prescindere dal sondaggio, è problematico. Durante la mia adolescenza, ricordo molte compagne di classe che a 15 anni uscivano con ragazzi di 25. A 15 anni una ragazza sta giusto cominciando ad essere sessualmente attiva. Le aspettative sulla vita di relazione sono completamente diverse. Due 15enni scoprono la vita di relazione assieme. Con 10 anni di differenza, la situazione si sbilancia.

In un certo modo, mi perplime un 25enne che trovi stimolante uscire con una 15enne. E' un 25enne non attratto da una donna che ha esperienze, interessi, personalità. Non vuole una sfida, non è interessato alle risorse e alle peculiarità di un adulto. E' un 25enne attratto da una ragazzina in formazione, malleabile, insicura. Non proprio una relazione bilanciata. Nella mia esperienza, lascia segni indelebili, dove la ragazza guadagna insicurezze, e non esperienza e fiducia in se stessa. Inizia anche la sua vita di relazione pensando che quel tipo di rapporto di soggezione, dove lui chiede e tu, nel dubbio, fai, sia la cosa normale. Molto spesso, si diventa donne non consce dei propri desideri, e partner sessuali un po' scadenti, soprattutto perchè non si è mai iniziato a conoscere se stesse.

A prescindere dai moralismi, la relazione fra una 16enne e un 18enne, e viceversa, può ancora essere formativa.

You act as if there is a price on a nation to preserve its heritage, you have truly been indoctrinated into the capitalist agenda..


&gt; ""Take back your nation""? By ""back"" do you mean backward in economic growth?


How quaint, are you always this facetious?


You can live your life praising the god of money all you want, just don't expect others to do it with you and sacrifice their nations for it.


Economic growth... oh dear, do you know that economic growth isn't the measurement for national happiness nor interests?

It is a secondary or tertiary consideration, which is today used to primarily govern nations as a whole and cause mass immigration to gain higher ""economic growth"", why can't people understand this simple concept.


People and nations are not simply economic entities even if you in your sterile little world want it to be like that.

The French didn't protest against the Lisbon Treaty because, in my opinion, they didn't care much about QMV or the long-term presidency. 

Some people interpreted the results of the referenda as the people voting down QMV or stronger role for the EU Parliament. No, the electorate voted down the **entire package**. 

When the symbolic and emotional parts were taken out people largely didn't care any more. At least not enough to make this treaty a major electoral issue in France or enough to protest.

I wasn't claiming any right to discard votes, I was just providing my analyisis. I remember the French vote and I remember the fact that people were pissed off about Chirac and also regarded it as a vote against him. 

Something that is completely forgotten: some pro-EU supporters in France campaigned for a NO vote because they hoped they could renegotiate the treaty to make it better.

Before I went to Australia, my accent was typical German so you could hear from a mile away where I was from. And since it was cheaper to fly to London and take a flight from there than take a flight directly from Germany, I stayed there a few days. Went shopping and I remember one shopping assistant just switching to nearly flawless German after I told her what I was looking for. I was so stunned I didn't even think of complimenting her on her fluency or ask her how she became fluent. 

I met a guy in a hostel in Gold Coast and when I saw him first, he was talking to a German girl who was cleaning for accommodation and it took me around 2 minutes to realize that he wasn't also a German. Turned out he was from Brighton and had studied in my uni town for a couple of semesters.

I also met people from the UK who were quite fluent in French or Spanish.

But the reason I remember them (except for the shopping assistant most of them even by name) is that they were the exception. Normally all the Brits admitted that they were no good at the language they had learned in school (usually French, German or Spanish) and sometimes boasted the 3-4 sentences they could still remember.

Still, I agree with you, there are good foreign language students out there. **And to everyone who is not an English native speaker:** if you come across someone who is clearly an English native speaker but trying to speak your language, don't just switch to English because it's easier for you or because you want to practice your English (there's heaps of native speakers who don't try to speak your lingo for that) but instead encourage them and help them practice. Just do at least a bit of small talk with them, more if possible.

Because I know exactly what convinced me to freshen up my high school French - it was not the younger French people in Australia who travelled in groups (the ones who were travelling alone were fine, but they obviously wanted to improve their English) and just spoke rapid French with a lot of slang and ignored everyone who couldn't keep up with them (everyone who wasn't native French). 

It was the French family I met while in Laos. It was the older French couple in Phnom Penh. The Cambodian grandma coming to the parent-teacher conference at my school and the old Cambodian guy who sat next to me on the bus ride to the coast who both spoke French.

En tout cas pas du sujet de la présente discussion, puisque la propriété intellectuelle ou les droits d'auteur sont entièrement hors-sujet. Si tu lis le putain d'article, tu verras que justement la seule mention faite par Maître Eolas du droit d'auteur concerne la condamnation de Bluetouff pour ""vol de documents"", qu'il considère justement ne pouvant pas tenir devant la Cour de cass', puisqu'il n'y a pas eu de vol physique, et que le délit spécifique de contrefaçon (désignation du vol de propriété intellectuelle en droit français) **n'a même pas été invoqué pour l'instant**:

*Le vol est la soustraction frauduleuse de la chose d’autrui. La loi pénale est d’interprétation stricte. On entend par soustraction une appréhension, une appropriation : il faut se comporter en propriétaire de la chose, dépossédant ainsi le véritable propriétaire. La soustraction doit être frauduleuse, c’est à dire en ayant conscience que l’on n’est pas propriétaire de la chose. Or s’agissant d’un fichier informatique, on peut le copier sans jamais déposséder le propriétaire. C’est même la règle et la base du téléchargement payant de fichier. C’est précisément pour cela qu’il a fallu créer un délit spécifique pour le vol de propriété intellectuelle (la contrefaçon) qui nuit à l’auteur de l’œuvre, mais en aucun cas le dépossède de celle-ci. Personne ne pourrait voler les Misérables à Victor Hugo. On peut voler un support informatique (disquette, clef USB, disque dur, CD-ROM…), mais en aucun cas le contenu de cette mémoire. Cette dernière condamnation ne tient pas à mon sens, et on peut espérer que la Cour de cassation y mette bon ordre (même si en cas de renvoi devant une autre cour d’appel, une requalification en contrefaçon n’est pas impossible, auquel cas une condamnation serait envisageable).*

true,Seefor,DENK,Copenhagen,"This giraffe business again?

Here's the story:

There was no place to send the giraffe, either because his gene-pool would cause too much inbredness or because the few zoos who did offer to take in the giraffe were not part of the European breeding programme, thus not living up to the standards required.

The lions in the zoo needed meat anyhow. If it hadn't been the giraffe, it would have been a pig, a horse or a cow. Why no love for these animals?

Unless you are 100 % vegetarian or vegan you are being hypocritical to complain this much about a giraffe, an animal that is not threatened with extinction or even particularly intelligent, when we slaughter thousands upon thousands of healthy pigs and cows everyday, who have been treated much worse in their lives in the industrial meat production complex than this giraffe, who enjoyed luxurious conditions for an animal in the zoo.

So, unless you think it is 100 % wrong to slaughter animals for food then what is your argument? Why should the giraffe enjoy a better status than the pig or cow? The fact that the giraffe is cute does not count.

As a side note I am simply flabbergasted that people think it is so wrong to show children how the world works. In Denmark we consider it education to learn children about animals and the fact that we eat animals and what that entails - and the fact that animals eat other animals. And they get to see it up close so they do not become completely detached from the relationship we have with animals when it comes to food, rather than just as pets. 

I have a feeling that many of the people who complain about the giraffe are people who live in the city and do not see animals as other than pets. Perhaps if more people had gotten a more healthy and realistic relationship to nature and animals from childhood, instead of this anthropomorphising, we wouldn't see so many inane protests against the giraffe slaughter.",0,1392030822,null,0,1392032826,0,cfbm42o,t3_1xidp6,t1_cfbm42o,t1_cfblz99,null,1432333011,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Peu après, Yovan Menckevic à qui j’avais également transmis un document sur les nanoargent, publie un autre article. C’est ce document, transmis à Yovan Menkevic qui sera repéré en ligne par l’ANSES.

Alles was du hier in diesen Satz gepackt hast, stelle ich in Frage. Nicht weil ich dich nicht mag, oder dir nichts zutraue. Es sind nämlich lediglich Annahmen. 

Was du hier unterschwellig einstreust, ist ein Totschlagargument. Es führt dazu, die eigentlichen Ursachen zu verschleiern und so das Problem zu verschlimmern.

&gt; Die Gewalt

Welche Gewalt? Die Gewalt, wie du sie von öffentlicher, angegriffener Seite aufbereitet präsentiert bekommst? Oder die Darstellung der Beteiligten, die von einem feuchtfröhlichen Ausflug ins Grüne mit anschließendem Protest gegen eine spießige Veranstaltung berichten?

Bei Gewalt schrecken wir alle zurück und verurteilen den Gewalttäter in seinem Ganzen. Die Hervorhebung von gewalttätigen Merkmalen führt bei uns zu einer Einordnung des Geisteszustandes des Täters in einen irrationalen Bereich. Somit wird sein ganzes Sein, sein ganzes Ansinnen als abwegig eingestuft. Und diese Einordnung ist Entschuldigung genug, um sich nicht und niemals mit den eigentlichen Ursachen auseinandersetzen zu müssen.

Der Mensch funktioniert so. Und weil das weithin bekannt ist, wird das auch gerne in dieser Form ausgenutzt, wie in diesem Artikel geschehen. Die Betonung von Gewalt ist heutzutage die eigentliche Nachricht und zugleich das Ende jeder Diskussion.

&gt; [..] eine neue Dimension zu haben.

Auch das bezweifle ich.

Neu in welchem Zusammenhang? Für Ottersweier? Für diesen erst vor kurzem eingeführten Narrensprung?

Solche Vorfälle gab es schon immer. Aber in dem du das als *neu* bezeichnest, öffnest du Tür und Tor für die, die dann auch nach neuen Maßnahmen rufen.

Und gegen diese neuen Maßnahmen wird zur Zeit von liberaler Seite auf breiter Front gekämpft; namentlich zu nennen sind da die Totalüberwachung, die Vorratsdatenspeicherung, ein Polizeistaat.

Meine bescheidene Lösung aus diesem Dilemma: Ich versuche, die Diskussion nicht mit der Brandmarkung eines Gewalttätigen enden zu lassen. Die Darstellung von Gewalt in den Medien ist für mich uninteressant. Für mich interessant ist die Ursache. Weshalb wird protestiert und nicht mitgefeiert? 

&gt; Nicht die Gewalt gegen verfeindete Gruppen, eher gegen die Allgemeinheit in diesem Ausmaß.

Wenn es zu Anfeindungen kommt, gehören die Gegner ganz offensichtlich nicht, oder nicht gerne, zur gleichen Gruppe, oder zur Allgemeinheit, wie du es nennst.

Ich kann den Vorfall nicht beurteilen, weil ich niemanden kenne, der dabei war. Ich tendiere aus meiner Distanz heraus aber doch dazu, diese Geschichte in ihrer Ausprägung als Bagatelle anzusehen, die aber symbolischen Charakter 
hat.

Dass sich solche Vorfälle zu häufen scheinen, kann unterschiedliche Gründe haben. Einer unter Vielen kann sein, dass es einfach keine Allgemeinheit mehr gibt in unserer Gesellschaft. Sondern unzählige, stark voneinander abgegrenzte Subgruppen, aus denen es schwer ist auszubrechen. Und an diesen zahlreicher werdenden Grenzen treten dann gelegentlich Spannungen auf.

- Know how the highways are labeled.  For example, roads labeled AP means autopista and is almost always a toll road.  Roads labeled A can be a little bit slower but are usually well maintained highways with no tolls… basically, Google Map your route and put in ""no tolls"" and you'll save yourself a lot of money.  For some perspective, to drive about a half hour into France from Barcelona on the autopista (about 2 1/2 hours) cost almost €30.
- Some rental companies do have automatic cars, but manual will be much easier to find and much cheaper. ",0,1392032695,null,0,false,0,cfbmexp,t3_1xi115,t1_cfbmexp,t3_1xi115,null,1432333154,5,false,Barcelona,t5_2qosg,5

You can point your finger to a few questionable results of popular votes but keep in mind what big amount of votes we have on all kinds of issues every year that you don't even know about. Just recently we voted no to 6 weeks paid vacation per year. Votes about lowering taxes are regularly rejected, etc. People largely vote responsible. Scaremongering is an issue, we all agree on that. The protection of minorities is not perfect.

The approval rates of governments in many representative democracies are atrocious. The threat of a referendum on every new law does wonders to keep politicians in check. I just can't believe the type of trust in politicians I see in many comments (also in other threads). About how they are experts and they are making better decisions than the populace.

Literally everywhere else the proper substitute, capitalized or not, is ""ss"" or ""SS"". That includes all of Switzerland, where ß has been replaced with ss, well, everywhere.

I'm unaware of any special rules for ""technical drawings"", but I'm more than willing to learn about it.

**EDIT:** To answer my own question, it's right in the paragraph above that:

&gt; The *pre-1996 orthography* encouraged the use of SZ in place of ß in words with all letters capitalized where a usual SS would produce an ambiguous result. [...] *Architectural drawings may also use SZ in capitalizations because capital letters and both Maß and Masse are frequently used.*

Electoral systems like in the US, where money flows freely to individual politicians and parties, however, appear to be set up to limit the people's influence over their representatives. Campaigns are expensive, so politicians in actuality represent their donors.

In parliamentary systems, this is more difficult to achieve, as it is normally harder to donate large sums directly to politicians or parties, at least without it being public knowledge.

However, in order to prevent those representatives from representing their own interests instead (and as a citizen of a country with widespread corruption in all levels of government this becomes awfully self-evident), direct mechanisms to influence government and the country (like referenda to pass or veto legislation, or to repeat elections) must also be in place.

Switzerland decided to *voluntarily* enter an agreement with the EU regarding its status in Schengen and the market area. Unlike Russia, the EU and Switzerland came to an agreement **once** - after that, it was legally binding to both parties, adhered by both parties, and in particular it was not altered arbitarily (unlike, for example, gas prices) to apply political pressure.

If the Swiss government disliked the original treaties, they could have decided to not adopt them, compromise to different treaties pre-adoption, or even demand re-negotiation. Neither of this occured. Instead, Switzerland decided to possibly nullify its agreement *after it was agreed upon by both parties, voluntarily.*

Now, this was well within their rights. But it is within our legal rights as written in the treaties to act accordingly. 

I agree with you that it was orginally put into the treaties by both parties in order to have political leeway in case such as what is occuring now would in fact occur. However, nothing of what users here say the EU could do is somehow outside a *pre-defined* legal framework.

The last part is the really important bit. Whatever the EU does, it only does things people agreed it is allowed to do, before it does them. This is, in its very essence, what a constitutional state does.

Rule of law does not shelter you from consequences. It only shelters you from consequences that weren't agreed upon before you took an action. Nearly half of the Swiss population was well-aware of the consequences, and I for my part would view it with disgust to have them economically strangled. Nevertheless, the EU must make clear that treaties with the EU are legally binding and executively enforced law, and not UN guidelines which look good and do nothing.

The EU would be mad to punish Switzerland beyond measure. It would be equally mad not to use some of its now available sanctions. The door should always be open, in any case. ",0,1392038094,null,0,1392038531,0,cfbnfot,t3_1xfsq5,t1_cfbnfot,t1_cfbks76,null,1432333635,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Depends on what you are studying.

University of seville(the main one if you go to pablo de olavide is simpler but I doubt its that one since you didnt clarify) is divided into several areas.

You are doing architecture/maths/engineering/physics? 
You need to look into reina mercedes which is an area where plenty of students are staying and you will find plenty of flats waiting for new people to rent them each year(flats are typically shared with other students and finding some flatmates you get along with will be 10 times as hard as finding a flat near your faculty)

You are doing Dentistry?
You need to look into Macarena(just so you have an idea macarena is 6 km away from reina mercedes)

You are doing psychology/law/Spanish?
You need to look into viapol(google maps says it is only 3 km away from reina mercedes so it is not that much of a distance)

Most people are willing to cicle several minutes just to get to whatever part of the city their faculty is at but if you are renting a place it is probably best to start next to your faculty(even though the price will be somewhat higher) and then try to move to a slightly cheaper place once you know the city

If you are going to Olavide just look for places close to a metro stop.  Olavide is the last metro stop and it will take you a couple of bucks to get there each day but almost nobody lives close to olavide because it is considerably out of the city centre so there are limited chances when it comes to nightlife whatever.

&gt;

&gt;**Bone** is an independently published, epic comic book series, written and illustrated by [Jeff Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Smith_(cartoonist\)), originally serialized in 55 irregularly released issues from 1991 to 2004.

&gt;Smith's black-and-white drawings were inspired by [animated cartoons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animated_cartoon) and [comic strips](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_strip), a notable influence being [Walt Kelly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Kelly)'s Pogo: ""I was ... a big fan of [Carl Barks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Barks) and Pogo, so it was just natural for me to want to draw that kind of mixture of Walt Kelly and [Moebius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Giraud)."" Accordingly, the story is singularly characterized by a combination of both light-hearted comedy and dark, epic fantasy: Time Magazine has called the series ""as sweeping as the Lord of the Rings cycle, but much funnier."" The series was published [bimonthly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimonthly) with some delays from June 1991 to June 2004. The series was self-published by Smith's Cartoon Books for issues #1 through #19, by [Image Comics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_Comics) from issues #20 to #28, and back to Cartoon Books for issues #29 through #55 (the final one).

&gt;Bone has received numerous [awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Award), among them ten [Eisner Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisner_Award) and eleven [Harvey Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Award).

true,much_reddit_so_amaze,ANAR,Apathy,"Racist? Not necessarily. Really bad reporting? Yep. They've cherry-picked four distinct variables (Aggregate tax rate, Percentage of home ownership, average worth of household assets and years of employment before retirement) which, taken in isolation, seem to be better in Greece vs Germany. They didn't try to integrate them into a cohesive analysis of overall wealth in the two countries, however.

Aggregate tax rate: They're comparing the current German tax rates with the Greek rates from three years ago. There have been massive increases in Greek taxation since then. They admit that, but seriously underplay the extent of the increase. There was no need to use old data for this comparison, since up-to date figures are readily available, but that wouldn't make much of a headline now, would it? Even then, the most important factor that this article omits is that the average yearly income in Greece is much, much lower than in Germany. Additionally, the quality of government services provided (after all, that's what taxes are supposed to be about in the first place) is significantly higher in Germany.

Percentage of home ownership and household assets: This would need a long essay to fully explain, but I'll try to summarize it like this: Real estate has been the preferred form of investment/savings in Greece for decades. Depositing your savings in bank accounts was not an attractive proposition because of the volatile value of the Drachma. The stock market was considered to be something only the upper classes would dabble in up to the mid 90s. On the other hand, real estate was (relatively) cheap and provided a steady income (through rent) and economic safety. There are many other factors I won't get to here such as historic trends of land ownership and issues of national mentality. The main point is that the higher value of real estate owned is countered by deficiencies in areas such as bank savings and other investments. Also, the average number of people in a household is larger than in Germany.

Less working years before retirement: This has been changed in 2011 IIRC. It is now at the EU average for most labor categories. They also fail to mention that the average pension barely (if at all) covers the cost of living.

true,Gauf,null,null,"In my opinion the UK is a very crucial member of the European Union. The UK is the 6th (or 7th depending on the source) biggest economy in the world and its geopolitical influence in countries like the US help the EU a lot.

The UK has culturally a very strong sense of sovereignty. This many times enters in conflict with the purpose of the EU. I also think that its geographical positions motivates some distance to the European culture. As examples we have the fact that they drive differently they in mainland Europe, only partially adopted the metric system, only partially joined the Schengen agreement or even the decision to maintain the pound was partially influenced by this.

Due to this sense of sovereignty and cultural distance towards mainland Europe negotiations between the UK and other EU member have always been difficult. Nevertheless always a compromise was found.

Due to economical problems (e.g. the household income has gone from 5th to 12th place in OECD countries) lots of critics have been pointed to the EU as the reason for this problems. In my opinion the EU is just an easy target for the UK politicians to justify its failure in these last years.

All the negative propaganda towards the EU has resulted in a increase in Eurocepticism in the UK. Euroceptic parties such as the UK Independence Party raised in popularity. 

Now the EU not only has to take the blame from the problems of the UK but also has to deal with a more Euroceptic member.

In my opinion all these occurrences start to make me think that maintaining the UK has a EU member has become a heavy burden. The European Union is not an all you can eat buffet where you get what you want and leave what you don't need. The UK has for a long time been a very important factor in slowing and impeding reforms in the EU. 

The UK is slowing EU back and maybe it is time the UK part ways. I really really hope this does not happen. However I am in favor of the EU referendum in the UK and if the No passes so be it. Good luck UK but don't forget you will walk alone.

tl;dr: EU is being used has an excuse for UK economic problems. UK is becoming a burden to the EU. UK must not forget that if they leave EU, they walk alone.

I think this is the main reason why the ""lower"" tiers are failing at the moment. And this is so wrong. Just because someone isn't good at Math or languages doesn't mean that he can't be an incredible carpenter or mechanic. What does a future secretary or trader need differential equations for?

If people just would stop thinking that a school type is less worth, just because it doesn't lead to the highest level of qualification. The tiered system should be seen as a chance for every kid to get the best education according to it's abilities.

It is difficult to balance this out, though. I kinda like the idea of Gesamtschulen, where kids have their class but are sorted for main subjects like languages or Math according to their grades. But to be able to have this system running you need huge schools with 1000+ pupils (just think of junior high and high school under one roof).

In questo modo gli ospiti vivono più naturalmente i loro cicli vitali e possono avere figli al momento giusto, quello naturale. L’accudimento dei piccoli è un momento fondamentale nella crescita e nello sviluppo degli animali, e influisce molto sul loro comportamento. Spesso gli esemplari cui viene impedito di avere figli sviluppano disturbi del comportamento, soprattutto se tenuti in cattività, arrivando a ferire se stessi e diventando talvolta aggressivi con i loro simili. I sistemi contraccettivi hanno inoltre numerosi effetti collaterali che peggiorano le condizioni di vita degli animali.

* The UK’s EU exports for November 2013 total £12.4 billion. 
* The UK’s non-EU exports for December 2013 are £12.5 billion 
* The UK’s EU imports for November 2013 total £19.3 billion. 
* The UK’s non-EU imports for December 2013 are £13.9 billion

[Source](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/NonEUOverseasTrade/Pages/NonEuOTS.aspx)

So, as we can see, half of the UK's exports go to the EU (which, as you know, is a free trade area). By exiting the EU, half of the UK's exports would become immediately subject to all sorts of tariffs, trade duties, and export restrictions. In addition, the vast majority of UK exports are services (in particular, financial services), not goods, and services generally have much higher restrictions and tariffs compared to goods.

The UK's imports from the EU are nearly double that of the UK's imports from the rest of the world. Do you think the UK would gte such favourable conditions if it left the EU? How easily could the UK replace £20 billion per month worth of goods and services?

And before you say anything about the UK retaining all its trading rights and privileges without any of the other trappings of EU membership, let me tell you that that's hogwash. I'm not sure how many British people believe that they're going to be able to have their cake and eat it too, but that's simply not going to happen. Any EU exit is a historic event, and the EU does not want to set a dangerous precent. They will punish the UK severely for exiting, in order to deter other countries from doing so.

You can bet that the UK will be stripped of all its advantages and privileges. Undoubtedly the UK will eventually negotiate membership into the EFTA and re-gain free trade benefits, but that will take time and you can bet the EU will extract deep concessions from the UK.

The UK benefits modestly from the free flow of goods - since there are no import tariffs, prices are cheaper and British consumers benefit.

The UK really only has a problem with the free movement of people.

You see ones with 1,X Abitur make an ""Ausbildung"" because an social worker said thats the safe way, but your father is engineer/doctor? You go to university, no question!

Honestly, that's not the case or problem where I live. I personally don't care about the background my students have and I've never encourage a student into an apprenticeship just because their background isn't academic or witnessed any of my colleagues to do so.

I think the biggest problem which leads to the gap comes from the families (""I did not go to university, so you don't need to go, too"") and financial aspects.

Right now, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) still maintains extremely strict controls over the Chinese currency, the Ren Min Bi (RMB). For example, the RMB isn't allowed to float freely, the CCP is artificially devaluating the RMB's value in order to boost Chinese exports (making them artificially easy to buy on the international market, and thus undercutting the competition), and the RMB is not a globally tradeable currency like most other major currencies (USD, Euro, Japanese Yen, etc...)

However, the CCP realizes its current policy is unsustainable, and there are changes coming. The biggest of these is the decision to make the RMB a tradeable currency. This will happen in a few years. Nevertheless, to maintain as firm a grip on its currency as possible, China has decided that the RMB will only be allowed to be traded in two places: Shanghai and London. New York has been deliberately excluded, and is considered a slap to the face for the US.

Therefore, this talk of EU membership impeding the UK or the City of London from doing anything is hogwash. Geography also means diddly squat in today's globalized, borderless world.",0,1392042130,null,0,false,0,cfboga3,t3_1xi9fb,t1_cfboga3,t1_cfblojn,null,1432334113,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; Even in the era of the Internet and free-kind-of flow of information, where a purely direct democracy is technically possible, it's still inadequate as people have other things to do other than keeping themselves perfectly informed about every issue;

We do not vote on every issue. Changes in the constitution always require a referendum but that's not the usual case. Federal laws (and some other things) only get to a vote if enough people (50k) challenge the decision of the legislative. An initiative requires 100k signatures. It costs quite a bit of effort, time and money to collect these signatures.

We vote 3-4 times per year. Each time, there's 1-5 issues for every level of government (communal, cantonal, state). This last Sunday I voted on 2 communal, 1 cantonal and 3 national issues which is about the standard amount.

Every citizen receives their voting material by mail. This includes booklets (one for each level of government) with information about the votes. For every issue, the most important things (what's the situation, what is being proposed, what does the legislative/executive recommend and why) are on the first page, followed by a more detailed section, the actual legislative text, arguments from the people who challenged/proposed the issue and finally the recommendation of the Federal Council (our ""presidents""). It takes about 15 minutes to read all of this (for every issue).

Does everyone take the time to read everything and digest this information? No. But then again, half of the people usually don't vote.

There's also a weekly debate/discussion show on national television featuring members of the major parties.

Voyons [ce qu'en dit l'Organisation Mondiale du Commerce](http://www.wto.org/french/tratop_f/trips_f/intel2_f.htm#tradesecrets):

Aux termes de [l'article 39:2](http://www.wto.org/french/docs_f/legal_f/27-trips_04d_f.htm), cette protection doit s'appliquer à des renseignements qui sont secrets, **qui ont une valeur commerciale parce qu'ils sont secrets** et qui ont fait l'objet de dispositions raisonnables destinées à les garder secrets. **Il n'est pas nécessaire que les renseignements non divulgués soient traités comme une forme de propriété**, mais les personnes qui ont licitement le contrôle de tels renseignements doivent avoir la possibilité d'empêcher qu'ils ne soient divulgués à des tiers ou acquis ou utilisés par eux sans leur consentement et d'une manière contraire **aux usages commerciaux honnêtes**. 

Donc:

a) L'ADPIC **n'exige pas** que les secrets commerciaux soient traités comme une forme de propriété, ce que par ailleurs le droit français ne fait pas ;

So, Cyprus. Basically right of blood, from the paternal family (although there are cases were maternal citizenship was granted after judicial appeals)

So, if you have a Cypriot father, you can be Cypriot, if he recognises you as his legitimate children. If your mother is Western European, or herself Cypriot, that's usually no problem. Here, your Cypriot passport. If your mother is Eastern European or Asian, they will make your father buy a DNA test thingy, because apparently you can trust just their word saying you are their children (seems like Asian women can use mind control, according to our government).

There's an option for naturalisation, which is discouraged by other laws though. If you live in Cyprus for 14 continuous years (so, you need to manage to obtain permanent residence permit first, good luck), you can apply for the citizenship, and you can either be granted one, or be deported because they tend to invalidate your residence permit when you are rejected by the naturalisation process. They don't have to give a reason of rejection. 

The third way is that you are rich, and you buy property. We are not as cheap as Malta, it will take 5 million EUR of investment in the Cypriot economy (you can just buy real estate and sell it after 5 years, it counts). Preference will be given to Russian oligarchs, corrupt Chinese officials, and former dictators from the Middle East. 

And to answer the final question: There's a considerable number of disenfranchised people. The reason it isn't a huge chunk of the population is because the government deports them, even if they are 3rd generation and identify as Cypriots (I remember last year reading an open letter from the classmates of a guy who was soon to be deported, writing along the lines of ""Please Police, don't deport him, he's our friend, he's Cypriot like us, he's ready to serve in the army like us, he was already accepted in a Cypriot university like us, allow him to stay"". Tough luck kid. Come back when you are rich).

true,shoryukenist,UNSA,NYC,"So you are saying if Americans stayed in really cheap hotels/hostels, they would be able to afford to travel to Europe?  That is true, I've done it.  That is a lot of fun when you are 22, but to go with your family, or as a 35 y/o, I don't think that is a realistic option.  

Now, if more Americans were a little more ""adventurous"" they could travel further east and have a quite reasonable vacation (as I did so on a trip to Croatia).  However, when most Americans think of ""Europe"" their first inclination is to go to Western Europe; England, Spain, France, etc. etc., all which are quite expensive.

You also have to realize that a lot of people do not live a major international airport, and are going to have to pay for the flight from wherever they live, to an airport that has flights to where they are going.

I'm not going to deny that there are folks who think we have everything here, or ones that take the attitude ""I'll go to Europe after I see everything here.""  But I think most of it is cost.  My wife and I were going to visit my friends in the UK last summer, but when we did the math, it would have came out to double the cost of the trip we ended up taking in the Pacific NW.  

Another factor is that many Americans get very little vacation time, and can't spare the travel time.  I also think travel is a higher priority for Europeans, which is commendable.

You point about being able to go to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean is spot on.  The card you mentioned is for travel to those countries.

While your comment was not offensive, I just get tired of hearing about how Americans have no passports, and don't like to travel.  In Europe it is easy and inexpensive to go through multiple countries in one day, we are far from everything.  We also don't have the benefit of the commonwealth like Canada.

No, as you'll have seen from my earlier comment, nuclear weapons are just one factor among many factors. But nuclear weapons is certainly a factor as it one of the reasons why Britain and France are permanent members of the UN Security Council. And that does make an impact on influence.

&gt; I'd say Germany is more influential than France financially and politically.

Undoubtedly Germany is more influential financially. But arguably it is not so influential politically, partly because of France's military and partly because of La Francophonie.

Manche haben eine Verflachung der Mimik zur Folge, was von Außen wie eine ""Zombifizierung"" aussehen mag, aber sich nicht negativ auf das Gefühlsempfinden auswirkt. Man kanns nur (temporär, das verschwindet ja auch wieder) nicht so zeigen und man hat keine so argen emotionalen Ausschläge mehr. Was manchmal notwendig ist, um überhaupt therapiefähig zu werden. Auf Dauer fand ich das auch nicht angenehm, aber dann schleicht man sie wieder aus, stellt auf ein anderes Medikament um oder probiert es ohne und damit haben sich die Nebenwirkungen doch auch wieder erledigt?

""Vollgepumpt"" wurde ich nie mit irgendetwas. Ich kenne viele, viele unterschiedliche Berichte von Erlebnissen in der Psychiatrie. Mein Eindruck ist: je freiwilliger man dort landet, desto positiver empfindet man den Verlauf. Irgendwo gegen seinen Willen hingebracht werden, sich dort Regeln und Restriktionen unterwerfen müsssen und das alles auch noch in einem instabilen emotionalen und/oder geistigen Zustand kann man schwerlich positiv empfinden. Aber selbst Menschen, die ihre Einweisung anfangs verflucht haben, kommen beizeiten zu dem Schluss, dass ihnen entweder dort geholfen wurde (vllt auch nur kurzzeitig in einer akuten Krise) oder zumindest etwas konstruktives angestoßen wurde und sie anderweitig Hilfe bekommen haben.

Il punto sta tutto qui:

&gt; Parole che vengono confermate oggi dallo stesso Monti, intervistato dal Tg1: “Nell’estate del 2011 ho avuto dal presidente della Repubblica dei segnali: mi aveva fatto capire che che in caso di necessità dovevo essere disponibile. Ma è assurdo che che venga considerato anomalo che un presidente della Repubblica si assicuri di capire se ci sia un’alternativa se si dovesse porre un problema”. D’altra parte Monti rivela di essere stato contattato anche dal predecessore di Napolitano al Quirinale per un incarico da presidente del consiglio: “Anni prima – dice Monti – anche Ciampi discretamente mi contattò per sapere se a certe condizioni sarei potuto essere disponibile”.

A parte il doppio “che”, che dubito sia uscito di bocca a Monti e rivela poca attenzione da parte dei correttori di bozze, la _non notizia_ è:

* che è _perfettamente normale_ (nelle parole attribuite a Monti: assurdo ritenere anomalo) che il PdR, conscio della instabilità della politica italiana da quando è nata, si preoccupi _per tempo_ di sapere quali alternative ci sono;
* che la scelta di Monti è come quella di altri tecnici visti (e non visti; ovviamente al pubblico in generale arriva notizia solo di quelli che effettivamente si trovano poi a governare) in passato.

Peraltro, la scelta di un governo tecnico, contrariamente a quanto continua a reiterare il PDL (e non pochi nel M5S) _non stravolge_ i risultati delle urne. Alle urne il popolo viene chiamato a scegliere _il Parlamento_, **non** _il governo_.

&gt; 2. Air traffic
&gt; 3. Road traffic
&gt; 4. Agriculture
&gt; 5. Technical trade barriers
&gt; 6. Public procurement
&gt; 7. Science
&gt;
&gt; Later treaties
&gt;
&gt; 8. Security and asylum/Schengen membership
&gt; 9. Cooperation in fraud pursuits
&gt; 10. Final stipulations in open questions about agriculture, environment, media, education, care of the elderly, statistics and services.

Obviously, the one of ""Free movement f people"" is affected, and likely ""Security and asylum/Schengen membership"".

b) L'ADPIC ne précise pas **comment** ces secrets doivent être protégés, ce qui reste du domaine du droit national.

Well, it is funny then that it is the same to the end of the post. If that 2008 commentary was copied from somewhere else source of what you found, you should have given the reference.

Note the only difference I found was that you started with:
&gt;I really should start to bookmark the stuff I read and watch. I remember reading something about Marx's predictions 

&gt;recently, I'll see if I can find it.
I first read about countries economical history wherever I could find it. Articles, youtube videos, studies, academic 

&gt;papers etc. I also recently watched a documentary on NRK (Norwegian State Channel) which confirmed my beliefs.
Super equal is hyperbolic, but the difference between the average citizens weren't big. The distribution of wealth was 

&gt;very good in other words.
&gt;I'm not surprised you believe that those scary neo-liberal policies have all the blame for this. Just like we all believe 

&gt;that whenever something is wrong in Norway economically, we just have to vote in the opposition , or whatever party we favor, and all will be well. The truth, or at least something closer to the truth is that nothing really changes. It remind me of a quote from the 20's: ""The business of progressives is to make mistakes, and the business of republicans are 

&gt;to keep these mistakes"".


while the 2008 text started with:

&gt;lol socialists that point to Sweden as an example of good market socialism slash a good example of the third way need to learn some history,

&gt; About Sweden, from a very very very talented Swedish economist - Stefan Karlsson and here's what he has to say 

&gt;Recently, the so-called Swedish model — that is, the Swedish economic system with high taxes and a big welfare state — has been celebrated again in the press. The alleged recent success of the Swedish economy has allowed welfare statists both inside and outside of Sweden to argue that high taxes and an extensive welfare state are good for the economy. To fully understand this fallacy, we should review Sweden's economic history.

&gt;Until the second half of the 19th century, Sweden was fairly poor. But far-reaching free market reforms in the 1860s allowed Sweden to benefit from the spreading Industrial Revolution.

Berlusconi era il primo a non volere nuove elezioni. Napolitano ha agito come ci si aspetta che agiscano i PdR in queste circostanze, ovvero cercare di avere un nuovo governo _nella stessa legislatura_, ovvero _nel rispetto delle scelte elettorali del popolo_. Che poi ci avesse già pensato per tempo non è nemmeno strano, vista la spaccatura Berlusconi/Fini. Sarebbe stato grave se non fosse stato pronto.

Jobbik is popular because they are one of the only parties that haven't been in the government yet (and neither was their membership). A large part of their voting base is made up of people who are disappointed in both the current government and the left-wing opposition and simply vote on them because they haven't fucked up yet.

The only way Jobbik could get to the government is if the current left-wing opposition runs a strong enough campaign to get ~30% of the seats, leaving Fidesz without a 2/3 unless they step into a coalition with either Jobbik or LMP.

Large luggage is stored in the cargo hold. There's wifi on the bus.

You can buy a ticket for €1.70 on the bus from the driver with cash (€10 and under) and get change; the tickets are the same as metro tickets.

Credo poco al fatto che abbiano fatto assistere i bambini all'autopsia, non solo sarebbe stato di cattivo gusto ma molto complicato da gestire. Anche se, a suo modo, dannatamente educativo. Darei un sacco per osservare da vivo il nervo glossofaringeo della giraffa, uno dei principali argomenti di contestazione di quella puttanata che è il creazionismo.

Ora parlo da uno che si occupa di animal care, e anche a me ogni tanto capita di dover abbattere animali (sono topi, ma si sa che nessuno se li incula, a differenza delle giraffe-oh-poverine). Non pensiate che non ci sia stato qualcuno (veterinario in primis), che ha versato lacrime per la necessità di questo sacrificio. Non pensiate che abbiano fatto testa e croce per spararle. E non pensiate che chi le ha dato un nome e aiutata a nascere sia stato esentato dall'autopsia. Nessuno si diverte in casi simili, ed è doveroso portare rispetto per chi fa ciò che è necessario, per motivi che magari non sono evidenti all'occhio profano.

Worry about the euro, not the European Union
Wolfgang Münchau
The union is not compatible with a single currency in the long run

Last November 1 gave us a glimpse of the biggest danger facing the eurozone in the next decade: a period of sustained deflation. Eurozone core inflation – without energy prices and other volatile items – tumbled in October to an estimated annual rate of 0.8 per cent.
I would hope the European Central Bank would cut interest rates further this week. But I doubt even a marginally negative interest rate would avert a slide into deflation. Its deep cause lies in the way the eurozone responds to its debt crisis – through austerity and falling real wages in the periphery and a lack of adjustment in the north.

The existential danger to the euro is no longer a speculative attack, a bank run or the rise of extremist parties, but sheer exhaustion. Benoît Coeuré, a member of the ECB’s executive board, warned last week that the eurozone might suffer a Japanese-style lost decade. But at least Japan maintained near full employment. The eurozone faces a far worse prospect: a lost generation.

The political consequences of this scenario are the subject of an important book published in France by François Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the Geneva Centre for Security. In La Fin du Rêve Européen, he says the situation has become so intractable that the only way to save the EU is to abandon the euro.
The author, who is as pro-European as they come, fears the eurozone crisis could destroy the EU – a project he regards as far more worthwhile than the dysfunctional monetary union. He says a UK exit from the EU could act as a potential trigger for its dismantlement. I do not share his conclusion but his analysis is spot-on. The EU, with its legal treaties and its step-by-step crisis-resolution tactics, is not compatible with a functioning monetary union in the long run.

The way the eurozone is trying to solve the crisis – without debt forgiveness, without transfers and without joint liability debt instruments, and on the basis of fiscal adjustment alone – has produced a deflationary debt crisis with no end in sight. A resolution would require a political union with strong, central decision-making powers. The EU institutions, however, have been created with a corporatist mindset – geared towards dealing with trade conflicts or competition issues but not with the big issues of macroeconomic policy.

The core of Prof Heisbourg’s argument is that we are stuck in a vicious circle. Electorates blame Europe for the crisis, and are unwilling to transfer more powers to the centre. Yet such a transfer would be necessary to solve the crisis.

This is all true but I disagree that a decision to abandon the euro would solve the problem. Even if a dissolution of the euro were well managed, which it may be, I think Prof Heisbourg underestimates the economic and financial chaos it would create – not just in Europe.

I am also sceptical about his enthusiasm for a euro-free EU. Without the single currency, the EU would be a pretty dull place, which it was not in 1998. The common foreign and security policy is going nowhere. Without a single currency, the EU would roll back the single market. And, with only so many countries left to accede, the enlargement process cannot go on indefinitely. Whatever may drive the UK to remain in the EU or to quit is probably not related to the euro.

I once proposed the opposite course of action – to recognise that the eurozone is now the true kernel of European integration – and to continue from there, changing the treaties with a view to turning the EU into an organisation fit to manage a complex monetary union. Such a political union would need to include a framework for the resolution of existing debt, joint liability instruments for future debt, a banking union firmly anchored at the central political level, and additional fiscal transfers as well.

I acknowledge Prof Heisbourg’s argument that this course of action would be unrealistic if electorates reject those treaty changes indefinitely. In that case, we would have to accept the eurozone was doomed. But it is less clear to me why electorates would choose this course of action indefinitely if the status quo locks the eurozone into permanent deflation and low growth.

Politics is about choices. Failure to choose is a choice, too. In that case, the crisis will continue, and we will enter Prof Heisbourg’s nightmare scenario of a European electorate turning against Europe. That would be the end of the EU and the euro.

Of the options pursued and under discussion, I believe two are unrealistic. One is the attempt to solve the crisis through communication policy – which is what we are doing now, with a banking union that excludes any form of joint liability, or with endless protestations that the crisis is over or that the eurozone is recovering. The second set of unrealistic options, I fear, would be to go back to 1998 and start again.

I would not give up on genuine political union just yet. But if we do, the set of options available to us becomes depressingly narrow.",0,1392050862,null,0,false,0,cfbrm7q,t3_1xj2py,t1_cfbrm7q,t3_1xj2py,null,1432335662,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,velidb,BOSN,Bosnia and Herzegovina,"Obviously setting the building on fire didn't fix anything, but it was the first time the politicians realized they are not perfectly safe and free to do whatever they desire. Seriously. The damage done to the buildings really is an acceptable damage. We've had protests before, organized protests for all sort of things, all sort of workers unions with peaceful strikes, all sorts of protests vs certain legislation. Sometimes the politicians would lie, but it came to a point where they just started completely ignoring the people. 

I will present you with one statistic. It is estimated that around 80% of the youth in Bosnia and Herzegovina is unemployed. Now imagine that 8 out of 10 of your classmates are going to be unemployed after getting an university degree, and 1 of the 2 employed will be because he has family connections in the government. The average salary in Bosnia and Herzegovina is 400 Euro. Please note that the average being 400 Euro takes into the account of the entirety of government officials having 1500+ Euro, where among them the average is likely around 3500 Euro. Now just imagine how many people are being paid 50 Euro per month to keep that average down to 400. 

These politicians literally have no regard for the people. There is no social strategy. There is no economic strategy. Want to start a company? That will likely take around 3-4 months of bureaucratic processes where you'll be stalled at least 5 different times unless you're ready to give the money to the corrupt officials. The same goes with medicine, you will be denied service. This is not something that happens to some unfortunate people. Literally everyone will be denied proper service unless they are ready to pay big doe to the doctors. 

These politicians have been creating excessive administrative bodies that, in their redundancy, create an illusion of work. There are soo many people employed by the government on some sort of ""revision boards"" for literally everything. It's pretty much impossible to even keep track of who is doing what.

The city of Sarajevo, being the capital, has no functioning public transportation, it's been in the shitter, barely functioning for 2 decades of promises that it will get fixed. They don't have water in private households after midnight. This government closed down National, Historic Museums, and there had been at least a few dozen of peaceful protests about that. Guess what, nothing got done, they are still closed down. 

It is true that some hooligans, kids and whatnot did the damage to the buildings. But the way the media and the political elites had been united in planting stories about: the huge cultural crime in destruction of the national archive, which seriously hadn't been destroyed. I am not making this up. Their second thing was ""all the protesters were on drugs"" claimed they found 12 kg of Speed, which was immediately discredited by the Police. Their next stories were all sorts of conspirator bullshit stories. They tried to appeal to the normal ""educated"" citizen and turn these citizens vs the protesters. And they had successfully done that because of their gullibility. This is the reason I am so royally angry at jules, and well, I just don't care much about reddit lately, so I couldn't care to invest more than a minute into those comments. 

If you know any local language. I will give you news articles written by Aleksandar Hemon (McArthur Genius Award Winner), by Harvard Law School Graduates (my friends), certain liberal &amp; western educated UN officials in the country, and ""neutral"" news sources. They are all recognizing that these ""archive"" type of stories were just there to turn the citizens vs the protesters. Unfortunately, as you can see from your own example, it's hard to give up some archive for a higher cause. And exactly that is the reason we, the people, will lose another one.

Die Preise bei Steam sind teilweise extrem gut, außerdem kann man Keys von Drittanbietern problemlos nutzen.

Die Verfügbarkeit ist großartig, man kann sofort Zugriff auf alle Spiele haben, die man möchte, vorausgesetzt ein Publisher macht da keinen Ärger (EA/Origin). Die Qualität der Spiele ist alleinige Sache von Publishern und Entwicklern, da kann Valve wirklich nichts machen, außer Katastrophen wie damals WarZ aus dem Angebot nehmen. Die von dir beschriebenen Probleme treffen auf die Videospielbranche und explizit auch Steam am wenigsten von allen Mediensparten zu.

* I Maestri dell'Orzo

Exactement. Je trouve exténuant ces conversations avec des psychorigides qui croient que si on accède à des données via un protocole ""non protégé"", alors c'est évident que moralement on avait le droit d'y accéder. Les même psychorigides ont généralement une perception à peu prés normale de la notion de propriété privée dans la vie de tous les jours (i.e. effectivement ils sont conscients que ce n'est pas parce qu'une porte est ouverte qu'on a le droit de pénétrer chez quelqu'un) et pourtant dès qu'on parle données informatiques, l'évidence d'une situation s'efface devant une définition psychorigide du rôle d'un protocole.

HAHAHAHAHA!

En fait, ils n'ont rien ""rattrapé"" du tout: in fine, aucune directive européenne n'a été passée qui puisse servir à clarifier ce qui veut dire [l'Art. 52(3) de la Convention sur le Brevet Européen](http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2010/f/ar52.html) par ""l'un de ces éléments, considéré en tant que tel"". La conséquence est que des brevets portant sur des logiciels sont toujours délivrés et considérés valables par les tribunaux à travers l'UE. Ce qui n'a pas empêché que ce résultat ait été claironné comme un triomphe par le fondateur de la campagne NoSoftwarePatents.com, un certain Florian Müller qui n'est aujourd'hui [plus en odeur de saintété](http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=24633) parmi les partisans des logiciels libres, même s'il a toujours un grand talent pour se vendre.

Turnout was 56%, which is very high. And the vote was won by 50.3% or by 19 516 people in favor of this initiative. Additionally you need citizenship and not just residency to vote. Which obviously is a problem.

If you want to blame anyone then you should look at the Ticinese who supported this initiative with 70%. There the support is as high simply because the downsides of immigration (namely wage-dumping) was the most visible and the politicians were unable to implement countermeasures (minimal wage).

And last but not least both the right and the left hold about 30% of the votes each. It's the centers 40% which decide stuff. However as there is another initiative ([ecopop](http://www.ecopop.ch/joomla/index.php/de/)) under way which does basically the same thing but for ecological and not xenophobic reasons and is spearheaded by mostly scientists, there really seems to be a feeling here that we are running out of space. 



But as you are questioning the system there are a few countermeasures, which need to be implemented in order to improve the system. 

First and foremost we need a mechanism, gives the juridical branch the ability to reject initiatives which conflict with the constitution itself (to prevent: minaret ban, automatic deportation of criminals, automatic lifelong-custody for untreatable criminals, anti immigration). 

Furthermore all Swiss need to be able to vote, not just those who have a passport, obviously the passport is a simple mechanism to draw the line, but this line needs to be redrawn. 

And lastly the other parties and organizations need to up their game. The worst part about this is that the SVP was the only party against FABI one of the two other initiatives we voted on yesterday. This initiative takes taxpayer money from several sources and bundles it into a infrastructure fund, which is used for the sole purpose of maintaining and expand our train network.

No, of course not, nobody would call for this openly. What I mean is that there is a trait in UK politics or thinking which aims for the dissolution of the EU. As I said, the UK has always tried to prevent the emergence of a major power on the continent. That is a strategy that dates back to the Napoleonic wars or earlier. In the post-war period, the UK first tried to hamper the EU by founding a competing organisation, EFTA, and then joined to prevent EU integration from the inside.

When I hear the very aggressive polemics about the EU or the Euro from the UK, I cannot help but feel that there is part design behind it. How many times has the British press predicted the end of the Euro? A member of the House of Lords even sponsored a competition for the best proposal for dissolving the Euro. And clearly a breakup of the EZone would result in a breakup of the EU.

true,will_holmes,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Brit here. I've already deleted several attempts at trying to give a rundown of British politics because, frankly, the current state is really complicated and totally unprecedented. I'll try again.

Here's the policies of each important party regarding Europe:

**Conservatives (Blue)**: Centre-right. Leadership favours smaller EU budget and is considered ""soft-Euroskeptic"", but does *not* support withdrawal of membership. Has a minority hard-Euroskeptic faction, some of which broke off to form UKIP. Has promised that if they are part of the next government in 2015, they will hold a membership referendum in 2017.

**Labour (Red)**: Centre-left. Is considered pretty neutral on Europe. Supports membership, but chooses to keep quiet about it.

**Liberal Democrats (Orange)**: Liberal centre. Most pro-European party, just short of joining the Euro. Fiercely supports EU membership.

**United Kingdom Independence Party (Purple)**: Right wing. Wants the UK to leave the EU and renegotiate a new relationship similar to the Swiss.

We used to have a simple two-party system, reinforced by a First Past the Post electoral system, with the Conservatives and Labour passing power back and forth. In 2010, we had a hung parliament, with the Lib Dems holding the balance of power. The only possible majority was a Conservative-Lib Dem coalition, which happened after 13 years of Labour majority rule.

UKIP's representation lies pretty much solely in the European Parliament, taking over the Lib Dem's former role as a protest party. However, the majority of UKIP's support draws from Conservative voters, which in turn weakens them at the general election. The next election could be a coalition or a majority either way, with not much of a swing required to decide it, so the Conservatives are trying to appeal to UKIP voters to win.

UKIP aren't expected to win a single seat, but the threat of removing the Conservative's power is making them very influential.",0,1392053597,null,0,false,0,cfbstta,t3_1xi9fb,t1_cfbstta,t1_cfbnzua,null,1432336232,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

&gt; Tu peux le citer ?

Quand il dit que le portugal a perdu des marchés, que le marché automobile francais se casse la gueule a cause de l'Euro. J'argumente que ce n'est pas l'euro mais une concurrence de pays qui peuvent completement casser le marché (pas l'Allemagne et pas l'UE, mais la chine, la corée,...). Souhaiter rester en concurrence avec CES pays la est une erreur car on ne peux pas gagner sans réduire nos acquis sociaux a leur niveau (ce qui n'arrivera pas).

&gt; C'est à dire ? Ça veut dire quoi une économie de pays riche ? Tu as des stats et des exemples ?

Forte VA, forte qualité, forte innovation. Ca marche pour BMW, pour les industries électroniques etc. En France on a en effet comme il l'indique, le luxe, le vin mais pourquoi on n'orienterai pas aussi l'automobile, l'électronique vers ces marchés. On a un potentiel formidable de savoir notamment en électronique qui n'est pas utilisé suffisamment. 

Un ex: http://contenu2web.com/liphone-un-impact-consequent-sur-leconomie-americaine/


&gt; Il dit surtout que les pays n'ont pas les mêmes spécialisations ni les mêmes structures. Il n'y a aucun intérêt à ce que la France se mette à produire la même chose que l'Allemagne... Si c'est ce que tu proposes, cela va justement à l'encontre de la mondialisation

Ce n'est pas forcément ce que je propose. Je propose de prendre une stratégie équivalente, pas forcément de faire la même chose. Celà dit faire la même chose si on a DEJA la structure, pourquoi pas?

&gt;De plus, selon toi, j'ai l'impression qu'on pourrait passer au dollar sans que ça ne change rien. C'est oublier la puissance internationale que procure une monnaie, et l'indépendance politique que cela permet.

Je n'en n'ai pas vraiment parlé. Je ne nie pas l'indépendance politique. Je rageotte sur le fait que l'euro est montré du doigt comme seul responsable des problèmes sans plus de réflexions...


&gt;J'ai déjà mis dans un autre commentaire qu'il y avait une guerre des monnaies entre la Chine et les US. L'UE reste faible et a adopté une logique de perdant, comme tu dis.

La guerre des monnaies entre la Chine et les US a une raison particulière (Chine plus gros créditeur étranger des US) que nous ne partageons pas. L'UE ne s'en mele pas, avec raison ou pas ce n'est pas mon débat. Je suis d'accord que la BCE pourrait être plus aggressive mais franchement pas d'accord pour dire que ca résoudra magiquement tout les problèmes.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; What I mean is that there is a trait in UK politics or thinking which aims for the dissolution of the EU. As I said, the UK has always tried to prevent the emergence of a major power on the continent. That is a strategy that dates back to the Napoleonic wars or earlier. In the post-war period, the UK first tried to hamper the EU by founding a competing organisation, EFTA, and then joined to prevent EU integration from the inside.

You're right that UK's long-term foreign policy objective is for there to be a balance of power in Europe. (This policy has been mostly successful if you consider the last 300 years.) 

There might be some people who would prefer for the EU to disband completely, but this is a very minority view, even among UKIP (and I write as a UKIP member). Most people in the UK who would prefer UK to withdraw from the EU do not really have strong views on what the EU does when the UK leaves (though of course everyone acknowledges that a Brexit is bound to have some impact on rEU).

&gt; A member of the House of Lords even sponsored a competition for the best proposal for dissolving the Euro. And clearly a breakup of the EZone would result in a breakup of the EU.

&gt;Tout n'est pas dû à l'euro, mais la monnaie pose problème et nous coûte 1 point de croissance annuelle

Merci pour les liens je regarderai en détail plus tard. Je tagge pour la suite.

Je me demande juste en général si 1 point de croissance ca vaut le coup si c'est pour prendre 2% d'inflation. Est-ce qu'on s'en sort? Normalement pour que ca soit rentable ne faudrait il pas 3% de croissance ou plus? Il faudrait que j'y passe plus de temps. 

Pour l'Allemagne : ils vont appliquer un salaire minimum a court /moyen terme (tu n'y croyais pas mais...). Ca devrait limiter les problèmes. D'autre part, les écarts de salaires constatés sont sur les services principalement (cout du travail presque équivalent sur l'industrie et ca c'est garanti par leurs syndicats bien meilleurs que les notres) et lié encore en partie aux écarts Est-Ouest. Je suis tres tenté d'attendre pour voir sur ce sujet. 

&gt; Dans tous les cas, la France, mais également tous les pays de la zone euro, paient le manque d'audace non pas des Français, mais bien de la BCE.

Pour moi ils paient les deux. Attention comme je l'ai précisé, le manque d'audace n'est que peu lié au manque d'inventivité ou de capacité. Je pense qu'on a (si on a pas un deuxième gouvernement pret a détruire notre système éducatif hein Nicolas S.), un potentiel a ce niveau. Il faudrait supprimer les autres blocages.

Enfin oui encore une fois je pense aussi que la BCE pourrait sans doute faire mieux. Mon post est beaucoup en réaction a la vidéo qui est résumable en ""tout nos problèmes économiques c'est l'euro ma brave dame"", et je trouve ca réducteur.

It does like options are very limited here and perhaps there is no hope. I suppose the only options are (1) to make Bulgaria (etc) a better option or (2) to make UK (etc) a worse option for them:

(1) Poverty in Bulgaria and Romania is (and here I am going to simplify massively) caused by very high levels of corruption and poor government structures. Bulgarians have very low confidence in government institutions. My Bulgarian friends (okay, my sample size here is three people and they are people who have chosen to live in the UK...) do not see this changing. There was an intial hope that after 1989 Bulgaria would move become more like a Western democracy (like Poland, Czech, Slovakia and to a lesser extent Hungary have managed) but it seems like in the last decade there have been no improvements. Perhaps high levels of skilled people leaving will focus the minds of Bulgaria into improving the situation, but I am not hopeful. To reform fundamentally, a real hero is needed and I don't think anyone in S.E. European politics is really up to it? Can the EU really do much here? 

(2) It is on balance in Britain's interests to welcome highly skilled people to Britain and we have done better than most countries at finding these people jobs. But one of the reasons why we need Bulgarian doctors (and IT professionals etc) is  because Britain does not train enough British people to do those things. Instead there are high numbers of British people on benefits with no skills who are a huge drain on Britain. While I personally am happy that we welcome highly skilled immigrants, our primary obligation as a nation ought to be to ensure that British people have the skills needed, rather than relying on immigrants to do jobs we can't or won't do. But, realistically, changing Britain to make British people do the jobs they don't do is quite a monumental task. Neither Cameron or Miliband are up to it. (We need another Thatcher to reform fundamentally...) 

I suppose one solution might be quotas, Swiss-style. But this (in my mind would be a taping over the problem rather than really addressing it). 

Also, as a libertarian I always applaud when individuals make choices (like moving from one place to another place for a better life). I've done this myself after all. ",0,1392056988,null,0,false,0,cfbujot,t3_1xie46,t1_cfbujot,t1_cfbtw4p,null,1432337047,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I never understand why people think this. Britain maintains one of the world's leading armies, is a nuclear power, a permanent security council member and one of the world's largest donors to organisations like the UN and ICC. London is the world's banking centre, then Bank of England is one of the world's leading central banks (note its importance in LIBOR) and diplomatically Britain is one of, if not the, world's foremost soft power nation.

The difference is Empire's disappearance made Britain lose its hard power potential and clearly weakened its global reach (the use of Empire in WW1 and WW2 show this). Meanwhile China has grown into what it is and Russia has remained exceptionally powerful despite the fall of the USSR.

Ed ovviamente ti riferisci al solo post di cui stiamo discutendo, spero. Perche' in caso contrario, il ""ricicli i contenuti di altri"" non ti dico dove puoi metterlo...

Beh, se proprio non fossi un novellino come sostieni di non essere, avresti magari avuto la cura di andare a vedere l'anzianita' di quel blog. E magari fare qualche ricerca su Google per il numero di pagine indicizzate. E forse capiresti che i sei (SEI!!!) visitatori da reddit di oggi non e' che spostino poi chissa' quali numeri, eh...

Comunque non c'e' problema... postero' i miei contenuti su videogiochi, traduzioni di videogiochi, design di Wordpress e nozioni su sicurezza applicata al web, da ora in avanti, nelle sezioni appropriate. Vuoi mica vedere che -magari- possano interessare a piu' di 6 persone?. E, ovviamente, credo non mi terro' ben alla larga da questo subreddit. Subreddit **pieno zeppo** di gente che - come me - pposta link ""propri"" ma che maschera i titoli dei post come domande, in modo che *sembrino* contenuti provenienti da altre fonti. Fonti che, comunque, non hanno **nulla** di diverso o di meno autorevole di questo o di quel blog.  Ma questo ti va bene, giusto?

Perche' - magari - le stupidaggini in fatto di tecnologia, tette &amp; culi che vedi su repubblica.it ti vanno bene (ma solo perche' *sono di repubblica*, come se ""essere di repubblica.it"" fosse motivo di qualche vanto...) ma non ti vanno bene articoli di un blog pubblicati dai loro stessi autori. Cos'e', forse per informare anche i frequentatori di reddit che da me ci sono le due traduzioni amatoriali in Italiano di videogiochi piu' famose e stimate in assoluto ed ancora ricercatissime (nonche' linkate, per dire, pure su Wikipedia...) e che, sommate fra loro, hanno avuto quasi 200.000 download, avrei magari dovuto mandare mio cuggino? Solo perche' a te non va bene che io posti i miei contenuti? Ma per piacere...

The same happens with *Plaza de Colón*, *Gran Vía/Metropolis*, *Plaza de Cibeles* and *Museo del Prado*. Furthermore, depending on the exhibition at *Museo del Prado*, a duration of 90 minutes for that visit is almost a joke.

Also, visiting the *Museo Sorolla* but not *Thyssen-Bornemizsa* or *Reina Sofía* (both of them very close to *Museo del Prado*) is a very risky option. And I'm shocked that you included *Torre Picasso* but not the *Retiro* (and the only reason I find to go sightseeing near *Torre Picasso* is visiting the *Santiago Bernabeu*).

A more rational thing to do is spend one day visiting buildings and walking (for example, from *Palacio Real* to *Madrid de los Austrias*, then have some typical lunch and move on to *Prado-Recoletos-Retiro*) and then the second day a visit to museums and, if there is time left, other places you may want to see (e.g. *Las Ventas*, *Santiago Bernabeu*, etc.)

You may also want to change the bus by the metro (underground) for the longer trips.

As planned, day 5 in Sevilla might also be a very busy day.

Ainsi, il est ridicule de voir que nos gouvernant changent notre constitution considerant que celle-ci nous protege d'eux. Les representants du peuple ne devraient avoir absolument aucun droit sur la constitution, juste s'y plier.

Je comprends tout a fait la pseudo-necessite d'une representativite. Trop de monde, pas assez d'education, etc... Mais toute notre societe a ete construite, depuis la Revolution, dans l'idee que nous devrions laisser des gens, riches, nous diriger, nous commander, parfois (souvent) a l'enconcontre de nos propres desirs, de notre propre volonte.

On assiste a des ""pas de commentaires"" et personne n'a les cojones pour leur faire remarquer que les boss, c'est cense etre nous.

Je ne suis pas particulierement democrate, mais il me semble que seul la democratie directe a un sens. Si on estime que le peuple doit etre souverain, alors le Peuple doit pouvoir diriger le pays. Par votations, par referendum, par assemblees locales, regionales, etc...

Je ne suis pas democrate au sens strict du terme car il me semble que compte tenu de la faiblesse de notre systeme d'education, qui a pour but de formater nos enfants a etre de bon republicains, toutes les perspectives politiques, morales, ideologiques, ne sont pas librement representees. Ainsi, des les depart, le systeme est fausse.

Je comprends bien le ""risque"" de donner le pouvoir au Peuple (extremisme, religiosite exacerbee, intolerance envers minorites, etc) mais ce que je trouve inadmissible, c'est de nous faire passer notre Republique pour une democratie. C'est un mensonge ehonte.

Quant a la revocation populaire, je n'y crois pas. Le Peuple n'est plus arme, notre gouvernement y veille farouchement (etablis un parallele avec Obama qui veut interdire les armes alors meme que leur constitution leur permet d'en detenir pour se proteger de leur gouvernement). Comment pourrait se derouler cette revocation ? Et bien pire, comment serait choisi les representants ? comme aujourd'hui ? par l'argent et les medias qui vont avec ?

Regarde Hollande aujourd'hui. Je ne suis pas du tout un fervent admirateur des sondages, qui me paraissent juste de la propagande, mais tout de meme, je ne pense pas quil soit legitime a la tete  du pays... Meme si les sondages en question se trompaient (mentaient?) avec une marge de 25 points, le gars n'aurait toujours pas la majorite...
Et il s'accroche... et son gvt avec lui, et on nous bassine avec des conneries societales pour faire passer la pillule.


Et le pire dans tout ca c'est que, quand bien eme tu instaurerai cette democratie representative avec possibilite de revocation, nos representants ne serait que des scretaire legislatifs qui passeraient leur temps a traduire les lois europeennes pour les mettre en vigueur chez nous...

Non vraiment je n'y crois pas.

Dictators and would-be dictators of various kinds are humans, but they are not honest in their speech about their goals. I am a democrat because I believe in democracy both in the theory and in practice. In practice means when there is a contentious issue it should be put to the vote.  

For example the first past the post voting system in the UK was a contentious issue. So we put it to a vote with an alternative that I preferred. My side lost, but I accept that as a democrat and move on. I don't think holding a second referendum in a year from the first because ""people weren't informed"" or ""people were voting along parties lines for other reasons"" and using state propaganda money would be appropriate. Nor would passing legislation through the parliament to get a new system but calling it a different name. No the issue needs to just be left alone for a long while, perhaps 10 years would be the minimum before it is discussed again.  

I can't recall you europhiles ever accepting defeat, you always either make Ireland vote twice under threats or you just steamroller the will of the French and Dutch people. More commonly now you simply don't hold referendums whilst grabbing powers. The French and Dutch referendums come up again and again in sceptic writings because you bastards just discarded a clearly expressed vote of the people. Even in your other comment you were excusing it and talking about the *real* reasons they voted and therefore it's ok to sneak it all through in Lisbon. No. It's not ok to sneak it through in Lisbon. If europhiles were democrats you'd have accepted defeat in one of these instances, you just don't.

Oui, Chirac lui a demandé son soutien mais ne lui a rien offert en retour il a donc refusé. De toute manière JM à toujours joué avec le pouvoir en place.

As I elaborated, one of the main factors is that the oil will *remain* cheap as Iraq's infrastructure repairs itself and even though it's only a low share of the world's oil production annually, it's sill the seventh highest producer and that will increase dramatically in coming years. The coalition forces predicted that the war would be over much quicker and with much less damage to infrastructure. You can't exclude bad planning and lack of foresight into this. 

Lastly, getting back to the real point here, it's not about whether or not the consequences of the Iraq War led to cheaper oil, it's about whether the ends (getting cheaper oil, even though that hasn't come to fruition yet) justify the mean (deposing a dictator using warfare). 

Hypothetically, do you think that's acceptable? Probably not. Do you think demolishing Swiss interests and the negotiating table, leading to a Swiss recession, depression, loss of life due to underfunded medical services from the lack of tax revenue from the bad economy, and all that is associated with it, would be worth the EU getting a better deal out of it? 

Personally I'd say that the ends (the EU getting a good deal) in this scenario do not justify the means (demolishing swiss interests) in a similar why how the ends in the hypothetical about Iraq do not justify the means.

true,New-Atlantis,EURO,European Union,"&gt;You're right that UK's long-term foreign policy objective is for there to be a balance of power in Europe. (This policy has been mostly successful if you consider the last 300 years.)

Do you consider WWI to be a success?

&gt; A clean and orderly breakup of the euro would not necessarily result in the end of the EU.

That is wishful thinking. You could just as well argue that a clean and orderly war wouldn't be so bad. In the real World things are a lot messier. 

The Euro did work perfectly well. So why isn't it working that smoothly any longer? Because the members can't agree on a common policy! Disagreement is common, even among the closest friends. But in the various institutions of the EU and the EZone we have a framework for cooperation that has allowed us in the last 60 years to always come to an agreement, even though the members increased and even though the issues become increasingly complex. And now you are saying: lets do away with that framework of cooperation and we'll all of a sudden cooperate much better, we'll be able to agree on an 'orderly breakup'. So, I'm asking you what is the basis for this assumption? Is there a single precedent in history to support this assumption? I could cite 1914 (and 2,000 years of conflict) as an example of how Europeans failed to cooperate before we had the EU.

In fact, the disagreements we witness now are, in part, a preparation for an eventual breakup. Each side is marshaling its arguments for why the others have to pay. The economic consequences of a breakup could be worse than the economic fallout from the war, and most of all, the parties will continue fighting for decades, without anyone admitting to be wrong.

Re. AfD, what they argue does not constitute proof. It is merely an opinion. And if they were given the choice of leaving the EZone, they would be wetting their pants. 

Now why is it that you blame the Euro for problems in Greece and Cyprus which are clearly homegrown? Obviously, to Greeks and Cypriots that view would be appealing, even though they know better. Could it be that you are trying to drive a wedge between EU members according to the principle of ""divide and conquer""?",0,1392068611,null,0,false,0,cfc0961,t3_1xi9fb,t1_cfc0961,t1_cfbt9ep,null,1432339800,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The euro was successful in the early 2000s when credit was cheap. But the mark of a successful currency is not what happens in good times, but what happens in bad times.

There are many historic examples of orderly breakups of currency union in history. For example of the UK/Ireland currency union break up. Or the Czech/Slovack currency union break-up. These break ups didn't lead to war or violence or poverty.  We might well see Scotland / England end a currency union in the near future and again it could be perfectly orderly..

I don't think the EU has caused peace in Europe. Instead I think it has mainly been caused by (1) NATO (2) democracy (3) increased trade in Europe and (4) memories of ww2. The idea that the end of the eurozone would cause war strikes me as peculiar scaremongering. 

I agree that the primary responsibility for the problems in Cyprus and Greece are with the Cypriot and Greek political class.

Because theres much more to life than GERMAN. Germans speak generally mediocre english compared to other Europeans.

For example South Park and even How I met Your Mother are not funny in german! Man up Germans watch in its original language and after time ull learn more english.

Basically, the US works despite the inequality between states.

Otherwise, I said I preferred unification rather than division. I didn't say it was possible, and I realize the trend is rather towards division. Which in my opinion is a shame. Also, I wouldn't pair Greece with Bulgaria or Romania. I was rather thinking of more obvious and less disastrous unions, on ethnic and political lines, like a Scandinavian union for example.

Repubblica e Corriere sono la voce di due diversi pezzi di establishment, ed analogamente ai danti causa hanno posizioni che fluttuano (alle volte sovrapponendosi, alle volte divergendo) a seconda delle contingenze. L'ultima seria divergenza avviene nel dopo-elezioni, quando Repubblica spinge alla grande il governo del cambiamento di Bersani coi Cinque stelle mentre il Corriere (più per riflesso tardo-montiano che per altro) è già per la grande coalizione. Una volta che lo stallo viene sbloccato dall'operazione Napolitano-bis, Repubblica e Corriere si allineano al resto dell'universo mondo e si mettono a battere le mani.

Da qui ad oggi il Corriere resta su posizioni sostanzialmente stabili (ogni tanto gli parte l'estro e fanno le paginate di intervista a Passera, ma si fermano lì), mentre Repubblica attraversa la fase di incubazione della svolta renziana. Sia per motivi editoriali (è dura difendere una maggioranza di larghe intese quando il tuo lettore medio è incazzato nero e quasi quasi domani compra il Fatto) sia per motivi politici (di tutti i sistemi di potere orbitanti intorno al Pd, quello che esprime Letta non è esattamente quello dove De Benedetti è meglio introdotto) Repubblica molla Letta, e quindi Napolitano. La cosa buffa è che il partito di Repubblica e il partito di Berlusconi passano all'opposizione più o meno contemporaneamente.

La cosa sorprendente, semmai, è che a menare Napolitano con questa storia sia stato il Corriere, che lo portava (e ne era conseguentemente portato) in palmo di mano. Elementi per capirci qualcosa non ce ne sono, e l'assenza di chiarezza unita all'eccitazione che prende tutti ogni volta che il Corriere fa qualcosa (i poteri forti, i poteri forti!) fa girare di tutto. ""Complottone per mandare Prodi al Quirinale""; ""No, complottone per andare a votare subito"" ""No, complottone per fare finta di silurarlo ma in realtà blindare Napolitano e fare un altro governo tecnico"".

L'unica cosa certa è che una ragione c'è, perché posso credere a tutto meno che al Corriere che alza gratis un casino del genere solo per fare pubblicità a un libro dell'editore. Elementi per capire quale possa essere questa ragione, però, al momento è impossibile averne. Ed è il motivo per cui, finché non emerge qualcosa che faccia chiarezza in qualsiasi senso, mi rifiuto di prendere sul serio ogni spiegazione della vera verità sul complottone.

Trade and people are different things, a point I hoped was established pretty well when we ended slavery.  

So let's just consider what [Wikipedia says about Swiss-EU trade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland%E2%80%93European_Union_relations#Trade).  

&gt;The European Union is Switzerland's largest trading partner, and Switzerland is the EU's fourth largest. Switzerland accounts for 5.2% of the EU's imports; mainly chemicals, medicinal products, machinery, instruments and time pieces. In terms of services, the EU's exports to Switzerland amounted to €67.0 billion in 2008 while imports from Switzerland stood at €47.2 billion  

So we know there is a lot of exporting and importing going on from each side. While it's true that as a *proportion* of the economy it's larger for Switzerland than the EU, it would still involve almost as many people on each side. So to punish Switzerland you'd be punishing a ""Switzerland worth of EU citizens"" on the other side of those transactions as well. So that means companies in France near the Swiss border or companies in Germany near the Swiss border. It would be a key part of those regions economies, probably a slightly lower but still high portion of their regional economy. Under your logic the EU would seek to punish Switzerland for not permitting total free movement, they still will have movement, it's not like they are closing their borders, but this punishment would extend to the EU citizens who do trade with Switzerland equally. 

Basically the guy who owns a small business in Germany that does 70% of its business with Switzerland is not going to share your need to ""kick them in their asses"" because that will mean he will have to fire his employees, who will have to go onto welfare and possibly move out of their current houses, and he might well have to join them on welfare and not be able to pay the mortgage on his house. That's what I mean by real human beings will be affected needlessly over the pride of the euronationalists if we took the action people are baying for here. So while I find your statement ""honestly I'm not Swiss I don't care about their well being"" disgusting, it seems like you'd be cutting off your nose to spite your face if you did this because EU citizens, who you presumably do care about, would be losing their jobs and livelihoods. 

This is all basic economics but as eurofederalists have never been strong on economics, see the euro, I suppose I have to spell it out. Also, for people who have never had a real job and mortgage it's probably quite difficult to understand what it really means for businesses and entire towns to go bust over something as inconsequential as euronationalist ideology. The teenage cyber-napoleons and undergraduate philosopher kings on here need to calm down and talk about trade barriers after they've actually worked for a company that imports or exports.

true,New-Atlantis,EURO,European Union,"&gt;I don't think the EU has caused peace in Europe. Instead I think it has mainly been caused by (1) NATO (2) democracy (3) increased trade in Europe and (4) memories of ww2.

I have noticed that this line of reasoning is being purposefully propagated in recent months. If you had lived consciously through the last 60 years of continental history, you would dismiss it out of hand. Yes, (4) is a reason and that is also the reason for French-German reconciliation, which is at the basis of the EU. Point (3) is a consequence of the Common Market and the EU. It was the EU that consolidated democracy (2), e.g. through enlargements. Nato even included dictatorships: Greece, Spain and Portugal. That Nato cannot bring democracy can also be seen in Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, etc. France wasn't even part of Nato (1). Nor did Nato prevent war among its members (Greece, Turkey). Nor does the equivalent of Nato in the Pacific (the security alliances with Korea and Japan) bring peace to that region.

Nato is a security alliance, that may have contributed to stability for a time but certainly not to peace. It could equally be argued that Nato serves as an aggressive military alliance. Peace can only come through reconciliation. You don't think that the Germans would have willingly given up a third of their territory without the idea of a common Europe where national boundaries wouldn't be that important any longer? Without it there would have been revisionist tendencies which would have been a constant source of tension on the continent. In fact, without Nato, they could even have avoided the division of the country since the Russians proposed a united neutral Germany after the war.

Your examples of currency unions are hardly comparable. Anyways, nobody has yet solved the technical problems of a breakup. I didn't say that war would be the result. I said it would result in conflict. A trade conflict or trade war can easily arise. And all too often it is beyond the power of the participating parties to control the dynamic of events.

Yes it is indeed the blau.de brand of eplus. 

They tend to roll out LTE in areas where there is no DSL first. These areas have been determined by every ""Bundesland"". Eplus is very secret about the areas they cover. Mayor cities that are also ""Bundesländer"" should have nearly full coverage though. 

Officially they have not switched LTE on and thats why they do not have LTE data plans. Their tarif [9cent] (http://www.blau.de/tarif/9cent) (open ""Tarif Optionen"") offers a 5 gigabyte data plan for roughly 20 euros at UMTS speed. One more time 5 gigabyte costs 9 Euros in the same month. All with **no**  24 month contract.
&lt;Edit&gt;: The best coverage is apparently in ""Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Leipzig, München und Nürnberg sowie den Regionen Rheinland und Ruhrgebiet"".&lt;/Edit&gt;

According to this [message](http://www.blau.de/highspeed) they offer their umts data plans now until the 30.6.2014 with max 42,2Mbit/s download and 5,6 Mbit/s upload so they can test their LTE network.

I was going to give you an upvote until I read this.  Instead, I'll just reply.

""Bullying"" Switzerland is, indeed, stupid and despicable.  But while this may be part of the reason for the EU to retaliate, there are some non-condemnable (or not-so-condemnable) to do so.  To protect its own people, for example: if EU workers are expelled from Switzerland for being above quota, it is the EU's obvious interest to try to persuade companies operating in Switzerland to relocate outside of the country in order to gain access to the EU market — this is not vengeance or bullying, it is a rational response to a hostile move.  But in the larger scheme of things, the EU has the opportunity to show that its existence is useful by proving the contrapositive: that being shut out of the Common Market will be harmful to Switzerland.

You can't have it both ways: either shutting Switzerland out is wrong, but then you can't argue that the EU is altogether harmful, or it is not, but then there is no bullying, only a choice made by the Swiss of their own free will to withdraw from a bilateral arrangement.  If they change their mind about the EU, they can always ask to join later.

Unless you want to call ""bullying"" the fact that countries aren't allowed to pick and choose whatever subset of the EU agreements they like, but I think you can quite well guess the reason for that.  Some parts of the agreements are more beneficial to some countries, others to others: the whole thing works because the overall arrangement is beneficial to everyone, not every subset of the Acquis.

I have 2 problems with this, the first is that so what, someones birthplace does not give them an inalienable right to a say in how that place is run, The second is that the general Idea behind Scottishness is inclusiveness, if you come from elsewhere and contribute to the best of your ability to Scotland then you have every right to be considered Scottish.

2) an attempt to gain a favourable outcome is not a democratic reason, however even then I'd question the assertion that ""non-Scots are more likely to vote 'No"", I've met plenty people from all over rUK who will have a vote in the referendum and they seem to be split on the choice just like native born Scots.

3) The SNP, no different to any political party ever, will have made their views based on political gains. There's nothing wrong or outlandish about that, its just politics.

I don't doubt they made considerations but it has to be said, the decision to include 16&amp;17 year olds was a big mistake in this sense, at the time and I think even now, that age group are one of the most supportive of the union, however in Scotland 16 &amp; 17 year olds are considered legal adults and the SNP wanted them to have the vote.

At this time of year the weather isn't great either. There is really no other Italian city this bombarded by tourism except for Florence and Rome. I love Venice in the off-seasons and during their various art festivals and holidays (like Carnevale, which I'm guessing you'll miss by a few weeks) but most of the time you'll just feel like you're cattle.

Luckily you will just be an hour or two away from some other great places. Verona is worth a visit and Padua is a gorgeous little university city with a much more relaxed and Italian vibe. If you go further west you can get to Bologna, which is one of the best northern Italian cities to visit and which is kind of like a hidden gem. It has amazing food, a huge university and fantastic medieval architecture almost throughout the entire centre, including great nightlife and it isn't very expensive. A train ride there from Venice will cost 10 euros and takes about 2 hours with the slow train.

true,roadbuzz,null,null,"The economic consequences for Germany and other neighboring states are actually hard to calculate but the loss would probably be negligible. F.e. many highly skilled laborers who worked in Switzerland will return to their countries of origin. That would be hundred of thousands in the case of Germany and certainly a boost to the economy. Higher prices for Swiss exports also mean that foreign companies will have a price advantage and will sell more goods. Companies which previously had their headquarter in Switzerland will move to neighboring countries to conduct business with EU countries and pay taxes there. We would on the other hand lose some exports to Switzerland and it would be hard to replace some highly specialized imports from Switzerland. It would be a net loss on both sides but much much worse for Switzerland.

I don't think punishment should be an objective in dealing with Switzerland, however the freedom of movement is imo the greatest achievement of the EU. We should take some losses if it means that we could stop other countries from seceding from freedom of movement. Some European principles are more important than a few millions more GDP.

Switzerland has profited more than any other country from highly skilled immigrants and has an unemployment rate of 3.5%. This referendum was really the pineapple if stupidity and xenophobia.

Premetto che mi sto per addentrare in una digressione, ma quest'analogia secondo me non funziona perchè qua il problema è diverso. 

Il tuo è un caso di asimmetria informativa. Non hai le competenze necessarie per giudicare le conseguenze di una data scelta. Tutti vogliono che la nazione sia più ricca, ma pochi hanno le competenze ed un'idea sul come farlo, per cui ci si affida a questi e si incrocia le dita. (poi dopo aver stabilito come allargare la torta ci sarebbe il problema della redistribuzione del reddito e di come tagliarla, ma non farmi aprire una digressione colossale nella digressione)

Per le questioni prettamente sociali come i diritti civili, però, le conseguenze sono per la maggior parte osservabili da tutti. Questo non è più solo un dibattito sul *come* raggiungere un risultato, ma proprio sul *quale* risultato la popolazione vuole raggiungere.

Tutti vorrebbero una politica che ci migliorasse un po', il problema è trovare due persone d'accordo su cosa significhi ""migliorare"". Trovo che sia giusto che sia il rappresentante a prendere l'iniziativa nei casi in cui esiste un'asimmetria informativa ineliminabile (se in economia ""uno valesse uno"", ad esempio, sarebbe un macello -- e in parte già infatti ne paghiamo un po' le conseguenze). Ma negli altri casi? Negli altri casi secondo me una cosa del genere sarebbe come minimo moralmente ambigua, perchè se da una parte non trovo giusto (nel caso specifico, ad esempio) di poter impedire a due persone di sposarsi, dall'altra se il rappresentante si potesse arrogare il diritto di scegliere persino il risultato obiettivo senza dover render conto a nessuno, quale valore rimarrebbe alla democrazia?",0,1392081807,null,0,false,0,cfc6992,t3_1xj8t4,t1_cfc6992,t1_cfc4hco,null,1432342694,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

Per me la democrazia è un patto tra rappresentanza e mediazione: tu eletto (o partito) porti avanti alcune istanze al tuo meglio, con le competenze che hai. Io elettore mi affido a te perché tu possa portare in un parlamento i miei problemi, e risolverli con un compromesso tra i miei e quelli degli altri (che sono rappresentati da altri).

In quanto elettore accetto che ci possa essere uno scarto tra quello che vorrei e quello che il mio rappresentante può ottenere. Nel caso dell'articolo di questo topic, io vorrei la legalizzazione, ma sarei contentissimo se si portasse a casa anche solo la depenalizzazione.

Che le conseguenze dei diritti civili siano immediatamente osservabili è poi discutibile. Tanto che chi si oppone al matrimonio gay tipicamente argomenta in questo modo: ""se iniziamo a farli sposare tra froci (conseguenza osservabile) poi chi può dire che non si arriva ai matrimoni con gli animali? Dove stabiliamo il confine?""

Capisci perciò che il paragone con i problemi economici non è cose assurdo, si tratta in entrambi i casi della paura di quali conseguenze a lungo termine ci possano essere nella società.

E in entrambi i casi si può sia produrre un discorso bassissimo (""a me i froci mi fanno schifo"" è pari a ""ce dovete dà il lavoro! LA-VO-RO LA-VO-RO!""), sia avere uno sguardo più ampio (economico in uno, sociale nell'altro).

Questo al netto del fatto che tutti ""vogliamo una nazione più ricca"", specialmente in tempi di cazzate tipo la decrescita felice.

Io mi affido ad un politico che mi rappresenti e che decida per me anche cosa significhi ""migliorarci"", che traduca le mie istanze attraverso un'elaborazione politica, non che le porti 1:1 in parlamento.

Mit Alpen, Schwarzwald und Sächsischer Schweiz hast du 3 der bekanntesten Gebiete ja bereits schon verinnerlicht - daher gehe ich auf diese 3 garnicht erst ein, obwohl es hierzu mit Sicherheit am meisten zu sagen gäbe.

- Die Nordseeinseln, besonders ""Sylt"", plus in der Ostsee die Insel ""Rügen"". Im Vergleich zu den Mittelmeerstränden etwas langweilig, aber dennoch einen Besuch wert. Und klasse zum Fahrrad fahren.

- ""Mecklenburger Seenplatte"". Hier gibt es die meisten Seen in Deutschland.

- ""Hunsrück"". Wälder, wandern, Motorrad fahren. Hier gibt es zudem Sehenswürdigkeiten wie ""Idar Oberstein"" (Deutschlands Hauptstadt der Edelsteine) oder auch den sogenannten ""Hunnenring"".

- Geheimtipp West-""Saarland"", in der Nähe des Hunsrücks. Baden/Kayak fahren in/auf der Nied (Fluss), allgemein wenig Betrieb, Wälder, Essen in oder aus Frankreich, die [""Saarschleife""](http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/1t00ap/saarschleife_in_germany_today_early_in_the/), Fahrrad fahren an Saar und Mosel (Flüsse). Herrlich ruhige Gegend, keinerlei Tourismus.

- Ebenfalls sehr schön ist die Gegend um Koblenz/Bad Ems/Limburg mit dem darüberliegenden ""Westerwald"". Genauere Aussagen möchte ich aber jemandem überlassen, der sich dort besser auskennt.

- Fast vergessen hätte ich die ""Eifel"". Sie liegt direkt über dem Hunsrück. Auch hier möchte ich genauere Aussagen jedoch denen überlassen, welche die Eifel besser kennen als ich.

Alternative is B&amp;YOU, which has a stronger network in Paris, and which costs 25€ monthly for 5GB of data. https://www.b-and-you.fr/forfaits.html#forfait-24-24-internet-5go

true,jizzlemizzle,null,null,"Okay, don't know if you are a fan of Carbonara but if you want to be ruined forever go to La Carbonara in Rome, it's the birthplace of the delicious dish and the most amazing thing that I have ever had in my life.  Also, check out Campo di Fiori during the day - at night it's all drunk study abroad students with shit bars.  But during the day it's full of fruit and flower merchants - even if you don't want to buy anything it's really mesmerizing to walk through.  

I never had a single complaint about any restaurant or pizza place that I went in to, genuinely satisfied and they don't advertise the names of restaurants well so I was like ""Wow this restaurant is so cute, I am going to eat here"" and it was delicious.  They all were.  Also, always order the house wine, it's delicious and most likely made by someone's cousin and it's cheaper than buying the bottle.  I don't know if you know this about Rome but you order pizza by weight so you can get as small or as much of one flavor as you want.  I really liked going with a friend and getting a little bit of everything.  I have a massive sweet tooth so all the gelato was good, I sampled MANY different kinds at many different places. Always pleased.

Now, there are a million museums to go to, I don't know where your interests lie but there is this museum I went to that I can't for the life of me remember but there was an ancient villa that was dug up when they were trying to build a subway - or water main or something like that, it's in great condition. They have a self-guided tour that takes you through the whole house, it uses projectors to enhance the tour by recreating it or to assist in pointing things out.  It was so awesome and I am going to try really hard to remember it.

Walk around the Jewish Ghetto, it's really small but there are a lot of really cool stores in there and it's close to the city center so it's not too far out of your way.

If you have an iPhone, go to Vodafone and buy a simcard.  You can buy a month to month plan and it cost less than $20 for 1 gig of data and some minutes and texts.  I am mostly suggesting this for the data... you WILL get lost - Rome literally makes no sense at all and while it's fun to get lost for a while eventually you're going to want to find your way back.  Google Maps was my best friend while I was there and I really appreciated it.

You also obviously have to hit the really touristy spots, for the Colosseum there is this option where you can skip the line, which you will want to do the line is always insane, and get an Audio tour but you can an iPod touch so you get all of these extra features and video that really helps you to understand the structure and its history so you're not just standing there going 'yeah this is neat'.  I highly highly suggest it, it was only like 5 euro more than the general admission.

BUY A SKIP THE LINE AT THE VATICAN.  Best money you will ever spend, the line is hours long and then you basically are crammed in a sea of people once you're inside - better just to get inside as quickly as you can so you don't find yourself getting frustrated (Italians don't observe personal space).

If you want to take some time to picnic and have some wine at the park I suggest Villa Borghese, it's beautiful and it is huge and it's really an oasis in such a huge city. 

There is a really amazing gelato place in the same square as the Trevi fountain side note on that they have a really cool 'show' at night, they light it up really nice and it's so beautiful.  It's crowded like all the time though - just so you're aware.

Pantheon, after you go look at that there's this really good restaurant behind it.  12 euro for a 4 course dinner and unlimited wine!  It's good food too.

I love Opera, don't know about you but I think it's totally worth it to go the theater is amazingly beautiful and so is opera. 

Do not drink a cappucino with pizza, you will be shamed by all Italians.  Get a cornetto con crema and eat it... for me.  It was my favorite breakfast pastry and it is more delicious than you can ever imagine.  It's a croissant (but baked Italian-style) with this cream inside that is like vanilla pudding and the coffee is so amazing, best breakfast in the world.

I am also a huge ancient history buff and I had a walking tour of some interesting spots throughout the city.

So yeah, this is all I can think of right now but there is so much to do in Rome, so much art, culture, history, food and wine you will have no problem filling up your time there.

Hope this helps!!
