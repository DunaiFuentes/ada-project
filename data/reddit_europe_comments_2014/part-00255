Wir selbst, unser Universum ist z.B. ein Teil eines laufenden Titans, ein Gott. Unser Universum ist eine Zelle dieses Organismus. Wir sind vergleichbar mit Bakterien welche in unseren Darm leben, alles ist unendlich. Wir leben in Unendlickeit.

Menschen sind Affen mit Waffen, ein Virus auf Schuhen.

Wir sind konditionierte Bürger, Konsumenten und Arbeiter. Wir sind nicht mal annähernd die höchste Lebensform, wir sind lediglich die höchste Lebensform unserer Dimension und unsere Dimension ist was wir mit unsereren materiellen Sinnen wahrnehmen können. Alles was darüber hinausgeht, ist nur mit Seelenreisen erfahrbar.

Bildung ist Brainwashing und nur dazu da Leute intelligent genug zu machen um Maschinen zu bedienen und dumm genug zu halten, damit sie nicht verstehen was gespielt wird. Technologischer Fortschritt ist redundant und macht nicht glücklich. Wir sind moderne Sklaven eines hochentwickelten, ultra-komplexen Systems, unsere Realität ist vermutlich für uns geschaffen mit dem Ziel uns am Leben zu erhalten und von uns zu profitieren. Ja, ähnlich wie in der Matrix. 

Unsere Ketten und Zäune sind nicht wie z.B. bei der Massentierhaltung materiell in Natur, sondern in unseren Köpfen. Jede Sekunde Realität ist Abklenkung von der Wahrheit unserer Existenz. Selbst wenn wir die Technologie entwickeln würden, uns mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit fort zu bewegen, währen wir immer noch nicht einen Schritt weiter. Wenn du realisieren würdest, was ich damit wirklich impliziere, würdest du auf der Stelle brechen. Die Weisheiten, welche uns Buddha oder Jesus mitteilen wollten, sind von solch einer Tragweite die über jedes Dogma und Vorstellungen der Kirchen und Religionen hinausgehen. 

Nur der Glaube macht uns frei wollte uns Jesus sagen, denn wir sind Sklaven der materiellen Welt, einer Scheinwelt welche uns von der Wahrheit ablenkt.

Deshalb sind z.B. auch psychedelische Drogen verboten weil man natürlich nicht will, dass Menschen ihr Bewusstsein erweitern. Die westlichen Drogen sind Alkohol, Nikotin und Koffein/Teein, leistungssteigernde Drogen für die Arbeitswoche und bewusstseinschränkende Drogen in der Freizeit. 

Denn was psychedelics machen ist diesen Realitätsfilm zu stören und uns ermöglichen hinter die Kulissen zu schauen. Wir werden uns unseres göttlichen bewusst und erlangen die Fähigkeit in der Unendlichkeit mit ihren unendlichen Möglichkeiten zu schwelgen.

Eines haben die meisten großen Philosophen und Denker gemeinsam und zwar die Einsicht, dass die materielle Welt keinen Wert hat.

true,leredditrevolution,null,null,"Of course, but it is difficult to find sources on the ground that are completely unbiased, and I am mindful of being used as a useful western idiot by the Russians. You have to be careful to sift the truth out from the lies. The rebels are the ones who are providing on the ground updates, so if I want some on the ground updates I simply have to listen to them, and be mindful of obviously dumb statments such as denying the prescence of russian troops.

Nonetheless I think, though I am not from the country there are 4 points that are not covered in this sub:

1) The Ukraininan Army is at least somewhat incompotent, and have stirred up resentment by shelling their own people and playing into Putins hands. This post claims that the Ukrainians are over extending themselves in an attempt to quickly snuff out the rebellion (before more help arrives? Too little, too late it seems). The Ukrainian government previously provided fodder for the rebellion by attempting to ban the teaching of russian in schools.

2) The number of Russian troops is fairly small, around ~1000 as I recall (but feel free to correct me), most of the attacks must therefore be led by local forces, with the russians providing support and acting as a mobile counteroffensive force as necessary. 

3) This post suggests that Russia is pursuing a strategy similar to that used by the U.S. when they invaded Afghanistan. Send in a relatively small force and provide support to the locals, and let them do larger part of the dirty work. This is reflected in the Rebels denials - they probably are genuinely doing 90% of the work

4) Even if Ukraine achieved a military victory, they would never defeat the subsequent insurgency with their hamfistedness. The rebels would have two of the major conditions for success in having sanctuary and patronage. It would be like the Mujhadeen vs the USSR, except the insurgents would be even better armed, and have fire support from across the border.


All of these points portend a somewhat bleak future for Ukraine.

GFY.

if you go back and read my posts, i in fact am the one who did approach the argument with facts and cites.  while acknowledging that british english often pluralises nouns that are singular, i correctly located the reason for that fact in its history as a pre-enlightenment country, but never the less maintained that the fact is that the 'united states' is a corporate name.  look up the concept and learn what it is and you will not be able to argue with that.  in this regarded i offered the example of general motors as a corporate name.  there are many more.

further, in rebutting his claim that language doesn't change as an effect of the war, i cited just one historian from many who notes the change dating from the civil war, and of whom all explain this change in the same terms, i further included a graph which dramatically charted the switch from plural to singular from 1866 onwards.  that is a fact.  there is nothing to argue there.

then i noted that in formalising this change as a result of newspapers calling for such, the change was in fact concretised by legislation, something the op said couldn't happen linguistically speaking, saying that such a formalisation would have little effect on language.   government publications at all levels, newspapers and books all adopted that change as permanent, as the proper way in which the united states should be referred to.

i then noted that virtually without exception this remained the standard for 100 years, until the rise of radical right wing politics in recent years.  any cursory glance through documents relating to the teaparty will indicate that this standard is well known and that it arose from the reasons i gave, because they have decided now to do the opposite to express their support of states rights over a federal government with which they are disgusted and largely consider illegitimate. 

fto the op insisting that british english does not follow the dictates of american english, and therefore uses the plural form instead of the singular verb because history doesn't impinge on british english, and because 'linguistics doesn't work that way', i suggested as an example of his argument the fact that we should then forgo the full titles of the british head of state because she is in fact just mrs windsor to anyone who doesn't historically subscribe to divine right, an apposition of his own argument.

the correct way to speak of the united states of america is in the singular, by law, by custom and by historical forces.  all of which i backed up with facts.  the correct way to speak of elizabeth windsor is by her title whether or not you think a monarchy is a crock of shit.  this is something which occurs across cultures, just as the proper reference to the usa is in the singular. and should occur across cultures.  in addition to which corporate names are grammatically in the singular.: you don't say ""the united nations are"" you say ""the united nations is""  

also, i know i'm whistling into the wind, because i noted that there exists in britain a number of corporate names in which the noun is in the singular and yet which receive the plural verb because some sort of multiplicity of terms appears in the name, e.g. the institute for scientific studies *are*.  this is grammatically incorrect but it is done with some frequency in britain.

so, where is my lack of evidence or citation?  particularly in contrast to the op's sum total of facts being ""this is how we do it, we don't do it your way,  because language doesn't work that way"".",0,1409461282,null,0,1409462550,0,ck57udb,t3_2f0vsx,t1_ck57udb,t1_ck57a69,null,1427273529,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

&gt; Anti-Ziganist: Well they commit a lot of crimes.

&gt; Me: Maybe discrimination and poverty will make people more likely to commit crimes. Not to reduce responsibility to the criminals but poverty and not ethnic identity is more likely to make people resort to drastic measures. *Criminals are still responsible for their own actions regardless of class or ethnicity.*

&gt; Anti-Ziganist: SHUT UP! It is easy to get out of poverty, and I would know because I've never been poor in my entire life. Besides, you're an American and have never meet a Romani in your life. You don't know what Romanies are really like.

&gt; Me: Funny you should mention that. I live in Oregon, which has the largest Romani population in the United States. And I think you should read this:

&gt; Wikipedia: Commonly referred to as ""Gypsies"", the Romani, ethnically and genealogically disparate from other Europeans, began settling in America in the mid 19th century, fleeing centuries of persecution in Europe. Americans were and are largely unaware of the cultural and historical prejudices about Romani held by Europeans, and though American Romani are cautious about the stigma associated with their heritage,[2] they do not face discrimination or bigotry as they do in Europe. As a result, the social and economic position of Romani in the United States is substantively more favorable than in Europe, with many running successful family-owned businesses, and blending seamlessly into the community.[1]

&gt; Me: While I think it is inaccurate to say there is no prejudice in the United States against Romanies it is certainly lesser than in the United States. It is telling that in the US with *less* prejudice Romanies are able to be a part of the community. Who'd would've thunk it?

&gt; Our hiring laws force entrepreneurs to be more careful when they make their hiring decisions. French entrepreneurs take their time to hire the right people and to integrate them into company culture. We have a 3 month trial period before bringing anyone on full-time. Our hiring process also makes employees more loyal, and in hard times, they are less likely to abandon ship. They form a commitment to you, because you took the time to pick and train them.

This is something I disagree with. I work in a startup right now, even though it's a bit different since consulting/recruiting agencies tend to use *ruptures conventionnelles* a lot instead of firing their workers. Still, the general direction is to use freelancer, interns and consultants instead of actually hiring, every time you can. As long as people have work, I guess that's not so bad, but hiring decisions being long and inconclusive isn't a good thing.

&gt; In France, most VCs assume the role of a bank (...). Due diligences are very long and you can find yourself spending more time providing documentation, 5 year financial plans and hiring projections, rather than focusing on the business.

I'd like to know his assessment of *why* that is. Cultural? Business-derived?

&gt; And while we value our US network, we still believe in having our company based in France. For example, the French Public Bank matches $0.5 for every $1 invested in a French startup; the French government gives back 30% of all R&amp;D expenses spent and engineers have reduced tax rates.

Aaaaaaand there you go. Most startups stay in France because the French State throws money and help at young companies so they can survive. Except what he doesn't say, is that as soon as these startups get somewhat big enough (in personnel, turnover, capital...), then everything stops. And a lot of French startups that learned to grow by eating up free public money don't make it when the lifeline dries up.

It's fine if it does help a number of companies grow and develop, but I feel like he's staying for the wrong reasons. I should be happy he's staying, I guess...",0,1409470598,null,0,false,0,ck5aa02,t3_2f1s4s,t1_ck5aa02,t3_2f1s4s,null,1427272394,6,false,france,t5_2qhjz,6

I wouldn't have anything against NATO if it was soley a defense alliance, but, although it does protect its members from foreign influence, it is not just that.

A defense alliance doesn't wage wars and intervene in the countries which are non-members and have never posed any threat to its members.

They are not protesting NATO as a defense alliance, they're protesting the other, expansionist and interventionist side of NATO, the one you don't often see in Europe, but which is present world-wide and can be held as proof that NATO is a tool of U.S. foreign policy outside, but sometimes even inside of Europe (see Yugoslavia).

That is why its understandible that Russia feels threatened by the eastward expansion of NATO's, mainly into Russia's former sphere of influence, thus breaking the assurances given by the West to Moscow at the end of Cold War regarding the very matter.

Mi sembra realmente una farsa, ogni volta che un ministro propone una legge ecco spuntare un tipo dell'opposizione che smerda su tutti i fronti la proposta, su che basi? Su che certezze? Poi si scopre che il più delle volte lo fanno solo perché devono dare contro al governo.

They don't leave because they don't earn a lot in Poland, they leave because they don't earn enough to cover basic needs. Your anecdotal experience with friends doesn't matter, Poland will always be poorer and they would do it anyway. What we need is more socialism, we need to shift money from rich to poor, to lower the inequalities. This is not only polish problem, but worldwide one. Higher taxes for the richest force them to compete harder and to invest in innovations to increase efficiency. This is how you grow middle-class, by giving people more money to spend. Today lot of people just have money for food and shelter. Imagine if they had money for clothes, cars etc.   
BTW did you know that USA had great economic growth in 70ties while having something like 80% tax rate for the richest? Did you know that Scandinavia rebuilt themselves on socialist policies with high tax progression?  
Brain drain will never be stopped. Poland will be poorer than other western european countries for at least next 20-30 years. Also people leave their birth country to get more knowledge, experience abroad. So instead desperately trying to make them stay and fail we could at least make the live better for the poor.  
&gt; high taxes for high income bracket are not only unjust    


What is unjust is people working 12h/day and barely making to buy food, while CEOs doing shit are buying lambos and yachts. Every next million is much easier to earn so it is obvious it should be more taxed. I'm not communist of course, I don't believe that everyone should earn the same, that's unreal and stupid. But in the world with overproduction of goods and food letting people in developed countries starve is tremendously stupid.  
Also remember minimum wage increase is very much needed.  
Also, if you fear that high taxes will make investors and people leave, why then whole western Europe don't move to Poland where (according to Eurostat) taxes are the lowest?

Dass ihr nicht merkt wenn ihr euch selbst widersprecht ist das größte Mysterium hier. Macht es euch nichts aus, daß sich die Ur-Motivationen einfach nur widersprechen? Es ist ja nicht so als könnten (oder wollten) die USA den Ressourcenbedarf der EU stillen. Daher kann das Motiv der Ressourcen schon iiiirgendwie nicht wirklich richtig sein. Ihr hättet ja einige alte Verschwörungen auspacken können wenn die Ukraine selbst relevante Ressourcen hätte. Die ist aber schon seit Ewigkeiten ebenfalls von Ressourcen aus Russland abhängig. Sprich: Die EU verschafft sich noch mehr Ressourcenprobleme die sie noch mehr von Russland abhängig machen würde wenn sie die Ukraine irgendwie ""annektieren"".

Was haben die Neoliberalen damit zu tun? Die haben nix davon wenn der globale Markt durch Sanktionen gestört wird. Ganz besonders bei einem solch ergiebigen Markt wie Russland. Also das kann auch nicht wirklich Sinn machen.

true,nomailing,GERM,Germany,"I guess that is at least one opinion which is maybe sometimes voiced in some newspaper comments or similar reports in Germany.

My impression is that Angela Merkel acts quite similar to other European heads of state. Sometimes she expresses her opinion about some matters and it is her right to do so. It is not her fault that the press of some other European countries is reporting so much about her opinions. 

Especially, if the debate is about monetary and fiscal policies in the Eurozone, then it is her right to voice opinions from the German perspective. It is just not acceptable for Germany to share total debt liability in the EU and at the same time nobody wants to give up some of their national sovereignty to Brussels. 

Maybe that is just my personal perspective, but for me that is the central misunderstanding between German opinion (news, Merkel, population) and the opinion in many other European countries.

Opinion in France: Why do Germans want to interfere in our sovereignty?

Opinion in Germany: Why do all these south European nations want to share the debt liability without giving up some of their sovereignty to Brussels?

Maybe, these differing views can be united if the next European Commission has a stronger voice and expresses it's own pan-European opinion. In the past if newspapers in whatever country want to report European views, they have to report the opinions of some strong heads of state, because there is no strong pan-European voice that could be reported. 

From the perspective of a news agency: Who wants to know what Barrosso says if you can report about the opinion of Merkel? If we would have a stronger European government it would be obvious that it's more worth to report the opinion of the European government instead of the German government. But there is no such thing at the moment, so the news agencies will report about the opinion of the heads of state of the largest countries. Unfortunately this will often be perceived as an interference in national sovereignty from these heads of states.

Isn't it a good step forward that the press in France is reporting about voices from Germany and the press in Germany is reporting about voices in France. Of course, it would be much better, if the press in France and Germany could both be reporting about a Pan-European voice from a Pan-European government. From my German perspective, we are not the ones who are blocking more integration to come closer to that point. Germany does not seem to have such problems with giving up their sovereignty... 

So my opinion is that each European country has to decide for themselves if they want to keep hearing Merkel's opinion in their news or if they want to give up some sovereignty to Brussels so that they can instead hear the opinion from a Pan-European government. 

There are some options how the European situation might develop from here:

&gt;Siete realmente convinti che la Russia invaderà tutti gli ex paesi del blocco sovietico? Seriamente?

No. Ma se permettiamo che si annetta parti un paese sovrano e democratico senza battere ciglio, magari alla prossima crisi interna il governante di turno deciderà di d'invadere qualcun altro per recuperare consenso.


&gt;La Russia ha i suoi motivi, che siano economici, politici o etnici. Volete cercare di capire almeno il loro punto di vista? (non dico giustificare i loro atti) Provate ad andare su r/Russia.

Ma certo che ha i suoi motivi, l'ha spiegato direttamente Putin: Se l'ucraina entra nell'area di libero scambio europeo, la Russia ci perderebbe un paio di miliardi di dollari. Visto che non può competere economicamente, ha mandato i soldati e ci sta ricordando che loro sono una potenza nucleare. 

Davvero, non capisco come in europa ci sia qualcuno che giustifica questo comportamento.


&gt;Poi io vorrei tanto sapere perché i media intervistano sempre il governo Ukraino o le zone con popolazione a maggiornaza Ukraina, mentre non ho ancora visto un' intervista *neutrale* alle persone che abitano nelle zone con maggioranza Russa.

Cosa vuol dire neutrale? La zona è in mano bande di tagliagole, non credo sia come fare interviste al meeting di Rimini.

Par exemple la philosophie, j'attendais ça avec impatience mais on ne nous a jamais demandé de discuter entre nous d'un sujet ou d'un concept, on a juste appris (par cœur) ce que tel auteur disait sur tel sujet à telle époque, comme une banale leçon d'histoire.

Bien sûr il y a une part de savoir, on ne va pas demander à chaque enfant de réinventer les sciences ou les mathématiques mais apprendre pour apprendre, c'est juste bon pour les tests, sur le long terme ça n'a aucun intérêt. A l'inverse il y a des cours que j'ai eu il y a des années et dont je me rappelle encore, des profs un peu foufous, passionnés, nous détaillant le pourquoi du comment avec des anecdotes amusantes, nous faisant réfléchir dessus (en droit, en histoire, même en comptabilité !) et parce que c'était nous qui arrivions à nos propres conclusions (celles que voulait nous faire passer l'enseignant, bien entendu), ça rentrait beaucoup plus facilement.

Mais à part l'enseignement, y'a tellement de choses à changer, les rythmes scolaires (8h30-18h30, eh, tous les profs détestaient nous avoir en cours après 14h-15h parce qu'on était trop dissipés / fatigués pour retenir quoi que ce soit), la vision que l'on a des différentes filières (à mon époque, c'était S&gt;ES&gt;L&gt;filières professionnelles selon tes notes, qu'importe tes intérêts, qu'importe ce que tu veux faire plus tard, ne pas aller en S avec mes notes a été un gâchis pour mes professeurs alors que je détestais les sciences), pas de cours sur comment étudier (s'organiser, faire un emploi du temps, comment apprendre, quelle méthode d'apprentissage nous correspond le mieux), pas de vrai suivi avec les parents (j'appelle pas des notes et un bulletin scolaire un ""vrai"" suivi), peu de cours pratiques (genre faire un budget, savoir investir).

Fin jdis ça un peu au hasard mais il y a tellement de choses à faire, je suis sûr qu'on peut juste regarder dans les pays nordiques et trouver pleins d'exemples à suivre (mais eux y mettent les moyens aussi), on aura peut-être le droit à des commissions parlementaires, des rapports aussi vite oubliés qu'ils ont été publiés et à des enseignants dans la rue avant la moindre réformette :p",0,1409486402,null,0,false,0,ck5cyp1,t3_2f2ndl,t1_ck5cyp1,t1_ck5cq52,null,1427271129,10,false,france,t5_2qhjz,10

Jahrhundert wiederzuentdecken, die seit 50-60 Jahren Gewinnbringend verkauft werden.... du hast dir deine Werkzeuge des kritischen Denkens nehmen lassen und hoffst auf eine vage Erlösung im nächsten Esoterik-Buch...

Intendo un giornale/giornalista che faccia delle interviste imparziali, senza prendere le parti di nessuno. Vorrei sentire il pensiero di quelle decine di migliaia (e più) di persone Russe che vivono in Ukraina, vorrei sentire le loro opinioni per avere una visione più completa dei fatti.

&gt; Se l'ucraina entra nell'area di libero scambio europeo, la Russia ci perderebbe un paio di miliardi di dollari. Visto che non può competere economicamente, ha mandato i soldati e ci sta ricordando che loro sono una potenza nucleare.

Probabilmente è anche per questo, ma credo che ci siano motivi che vanno oltre all'economia e il libero scambio europeo. Nella NATO sono anni che vogliono mettere batterie di missili a lunga gittata nei paesi vicini/confinanti con la Russia. Questo dal punto di vista russo è inaccettabile perché si sentono minacciati e perché in un epoca di pace non è il massimo riempire di basi militari e missili tutti i paesi che confinano con loro. Ok, l'unione sovietica fece anche peggio quando misero i missili nucleari a Cuba ma spero che il governo russo non abbia le stesse idee di 60 anni fa.

La prolificazione probabilmente è semplicemente voglia di emulazione: a suo tempo (2010-ish) quando aprii il canale la mia motivazione era stata ""Vedo youtuber americano X, mi diverte/interessa, penso di poter creare contenuti altrettanto divertenti/interessanti in italiano, ci provo"". Inoltre è piuttosto facile ""esordire"" con questa tipologia di video poiché puoi permetterti di mostrare qualcosa di immediatamente interessante (un gameplay) senza doverti mostrare in faccia e senza avere grandi attrezzature a disposizione. Se per esempio volessi fare un corto comico e ho una brutta telecamera/sono orrendo sarà certamente più difficile. Insomma l'entry point così immediato secondo me è un fattore da non sottovalutare.

Personalmente non ho mai guardato video italiani perché essendo il gamer ""medio"" italiano dieci anni buoni più giovane di quello francese/americano/whatsoever i contenuti in primo piano sono quello che sono, cioè quello che vuole il pubblico di quindicenni. Questo per dire che pur avendo una discreta esperienza nell'ambiente FavijTV non me lo riesco a spiegare, a parte il fatto che è un clone più bambinesco di PewDiePie e quindi c'è qualcosa in quel modo di fare video che evidentemente attira un grande numero di persone. Quel canale lo avevo notato quando aveva ancora sui 20-25k iscritti e si parla di un periodo ancora abbastanza morto in cui se facevi 5k iscritti al mese eri un alieno. Il suo canale è passato in pochissimi giorni da 20 a 60k iscritti e poi è stato tutto esponenziale: le cose sono due, o un suo video è andato viral su facebook o in qualche altra piattaforma, oppure qualcuno con le conoscienze giuste ha fatto in modo che i suoi video apparissero con maggiore facilità in homepage YouTube. Di tutti i canali che ho visto in Italia la crescita del suo è l'unica che mi è risultata davvero inspiegabile.

In America o in generale fuori dall'Italia i contenuti diventano molto più adatti ad un pubblico di 20-30 anni (vedi TotalBiscuit) e probabilmente ti risulterebbe più comprensibile la motivazione del ""perché questa serie è così seguita"".

Insomma non capisci YouTube Italia perché sei vecchio. :D",0,1409488160,null,0,false,0,ck5db2n,t3_2f2k85,t1_ck5db2n,t3_2f2k85,null,1427270969,6,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,6

Die Idee, dass Putin seine Eurasische Union will scheint nicht so absurd zu sein. Ich glaube die USA spielen in diesem Konflikt keine so große Rolle wie es die Verschwörungsheinis wahr haben wollen. 

Was ich z.B. als problematisch von seiten der EU empfunden habe, dass das Assozierungsabkommen z.B. eine Zollunion mit Russland ausgeschlossen hat. 

Nichts rechtfertigt das Handeln Russlands in diesen Konflikt - zumindest wenn man davon ausgeht das Grenzen und Verträge noch etwas gelten. Aber ich stimme schon eher den Kommentatoren zu die sagen, dass die EU der Ukraine ein schlechtes Angebot gemacht hat. 

Das Problem ist das man Russland unterschätzt hat IMHO - siehe z.B: http://anton-shekhovtsov.blogspot.de/2014/08/the-ukraine-crisis-is-long-planned.html - die Flagge der DNR gibt es seit 2006.

It isn't easy to condense the complex history of diplomatic relations and power shifting into a few-sentence-long TL;DR.

My point is that there are no clear ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"", as both sides want to paint it.

Sure, there was no written promise that NATO would not expand, simply because the top of the USSR dismissed the possibility of the Union breaking up any time soon to consider further NATO expansion into Eastern Europe a possibility concerning enough to warrant a written agreement denouncing it.

But it is clear that some top Western officials and diplomats made promises that NATO would not expand eastward, not just forcefully, but rather that it would close the doors to new members; the promise that was obviously not kept.

That was the cause of Moscow's distrust in anything the West says. They've been lied to and manipulated at the expense of their status as a superpower and their sphere of influence. The only way they could maintain any dignity or influence they have left was and is to use the same tactics of manipulation and deceit as the West.

Russia feels its status is in danger, but unlike the West which has learned to manipulate the political situation in foreign countries to suit their interests through non-violent means and indirect involvement in open conflicts, at least when Europe is concerned, Russia likes to use brute force.

Ukraine is the best example of these to diplomatic paradigms confronting head-on. The West supported, and probably even financed, the more Western-friendly opposition that soon toppled a democratically elected, pro-Russian leader of a sovereign country, to which Russia responded with brute force.

Do one side's questionable and possibly threatening actions make the other's response right, just or legal? No.

Can you shift the entirety of the blame on the Russian side? Also, no.

Both sides are wrong in this instance. The one thing Russia does have going in their advantage when you discuss who is ""more wrong"" who ""more right"" is that it 1) borders Ukraine and 2) there is a lot of ethnic Russians in Ukraine which genuinely feel threatened by the happening in Kiev, whether that fear is justified or not (and I believe the former more than the latter).

So to summarize, not everything is black and white.

&gt;Read closely that wiki and you'll see how other non-NATO members participated in some of those wars (Russia included). 

I could yell ""whataboutism"", but I won't.

When a sovereign country decides to intervene in a war, it's their decision and it affects them and the country they decide to intervene in.

NATO is a ""defense alliance"". It's purpose on paper is only to defend its members. However, the main word in NATO has the U.S., and sure, the U.S. will protect their allies, i.e. countries that will oblige it, but it can also use NATO and the dependence of NATO members on the U.S. and their protection, to bully them into fighting alongside Americans [against the regimes it dislikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_United_States_foreign_regime_change_actions).

Can you not see how Russia would feel threatened by a ""defense alliance"" run by it's largest opponent meddling in the country filled with Russians, which also borders Russia itself, and especially that country becoming a member of NATO?

Again, this doesn't justify the actions of Russia, but it does put things into a wider perspective, shows that the world's political and diplomatic stage is more gray, then strictly black and white.",0,1409489732,null,0,1409490155,0,ck5dnla,t3_2f1q0p,t1_ck5dnla,t1_ck5bh6c,null,1427270807,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Surely Russia would be rocked more from the destruction of the economic infrastructure in the west than by risking conventional war.

It's sort of like how certain infrastructure was overlooked in the past even in times of total war. Even then when whole economies were geared towards the war effort there was still a level of restraint when it came to fighting over territory that people actually cared about. 

In the closing days of the second world war, the German factories and research institutes were spared shelling because they offered a greater benefit to the winners of the war still standing. It isn't so much of a leap to say that point still stands today for both European and Russian big business.

So with all this in consideration, would the nukes fly? Would Russia, France or Britain really be willing to risk losing everything, including everything that existed beyond their own countries, just so they don't ""lose"" the war?

What are you on about? In 1964, East Germany and West Germany had a combined population of around 75 million. Today? 80 million.

&gt;Italy wasn't dealing with large amount of fortune seekers that burn churches in large groups and rampage freely because Italian cousine doesn't fit their own.

No, Italy was dealing with a clash of ideals on a scale not before seen in a western country. Between 1896 and 1922 Italy held 28 national elections, as the political right and centre did absolutely everything they could to keep out the communist left, resulting in coalition after coalition that just didn't work. The result? Fascism, Mussolini, the widespread persecution of people for political (and later religious) beliefs, the invasion of Abyssinia (~295,000 dead, ~688,000 wounded), the setup of Franco's dictatorship in Spain (Italy provided 50,000 men, 660 planes, 150 tanks, 800 artillery pieces, 10,000 machine guns, and 240,000 rifles), the invasion of Albania, and Italy as an Axis power in World War II.

&gt;Parisians could walk around freely in their own city without being harassed and attacked by rioting youths (read: Arab immigrants) that could not care less about French law and the French way of life.

You can still walk around Paris, you twit. Anyway, 100 years ago, what do you know, things were worse. In 1911, the Champagne riots took place. This wasn't street-corner intimidation, this was a real all-out riot.

From Wikipedia: 

&gt;As the mob descended upon the city little was spared. Homes of private citizens as well as Champagne house producers were pillaged and ransacked. Somewhere a fire was started that spread throughout the city. The regional governor sent an urgent telegraph to Paris requesting assistance stating ""We are in a state of civil war!"" By sunrise the entire village of Aÿ was burning. To quell the violence, the French government sent over 40,000 troops to the region—setting up a billet in every village.

&gt;**US and Indian foreign policy:**

&gt;1) US started supported Pakistan over India in the 50s because John Foster Dulles found the ""Abrahamic faith and discipline"" of its General Ayub Khan far more appealing than the ""weak-willed Hindu culture"" of Nehru. He also thought that the Gurkhas fought in the Pakistani army when he decided to support them. When told by the State Dept. officials that they fought for the Indian army, Dulles remarked, ""No worries. We'll get them to fight on our side.""

&gt;2) US support to Pakistan in the 1965 War.

&gt;3) US tacit support to Pakistan's army in the 1970-71 Hindu genocide in East Pakistan. About 500,000 to 1,500,000 million Hindu civilians were killed by by the West Pakistan dominated Pak army because they voted overwhelmingly for an East Pakistani political party. The (West) Pakistani incumbent government refused to recognize the electoral victory of the (Bangladeshi) Awami League and imposed marital law in East Pakistan (Bangladesh). Approximately 100,000 women were raped, and India was flooded by about 3,000,000 refuges.

&gt;4) US support (financial and weapons) to Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. India decided to step into the East Pakistan genocide situation after Pakistan attacked India in a premptive Operation Chengiz Khan. Nixon decided to stop India from stopping the genocide by sending in a nuclear armed USS Enterprise and supporting British naval fleets. They only backed off after realizing that the USSR was tailing them with a nuclear submarine in the Bay of Bengal.

&gt;5) Nixon's sanctions on India for not ""allowing those scummy Indians and that evil bitch (Indira Gandhi) get away with what they did in East Pakistan.""

&gt;6) US sanctions for India's 1974 nuclear tests.

&gt;7) US support of the Afghan Mujaheddin against the soviets in the 1980s. The US left a battle hardened Mujaheddin and plenty of arms in Afghanistan. Pakistan's ISI used these Mujaheddin to step up infiltration and terrorism in Kashmir. These Mujaheddin used to travel freely betwen Afghanistan and Kashmir through Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province under the ISI's patronage.

&gt;8) US financial support for Pakistan's security establishment which used these funds to support terror camps in Kashmir. Terrorists infiltrated the LoC to engage in the massacre of Hindu Kashmiri Pandits. This resulted in 150,000 to 350,000 Pandits becoming refugees in their own country between the years 1988 and 1995.

&gt;9) US sanctions on India for conducting the 1998 nuclear tests. 

&gt;10) US support (financial and weapons) to Pakistan in the Kargil War. The US even turned off GPS signals for the Indian army during the war.

&gt;11) More recently, the 2005 Modi visa ban has also caused major issues. Modi imposed certain restrictions on anti-Hindu propaganda used by missionaries to convert poor, uneducated tribal people in his state of Gujarat. An unprecedented combination of evangelical, Islamic, and left-wing ex-pat Indian groups lobbied with the Bush administration to use the protection of religious freedom act (that was only used once - against Modi) to impose a preemptive ban on Modi. Of course, the reason cited was ""Modi's involvement in the 2002 Gujarat riots"" but the real reason (restricting missionary propaganda) was never cited. Forget being found guilty for aiding/abetting the riots, the Supreme Court of India didn't even find enough evidence to convict Modi of ignoring his duty during the riots. Despite the Supreme Court's clean chit, the US didn't bother to overturn the visa ban undermining the authority of the Indian judicial system. Meanwhile, the US hobnobbed with mass murders, despots, and theocratic-authoritarian heads of state.

&gt;12) Hillary's use of European human-rights NGOs as a front to find ""mass graves of Muslims"" in Gujarat to implicate Modi between the years 2009 and 2012. The mass graves were found. But the bones collected as ""evidence"" turned out to be buffalo bones. 

&gt;**How US studies India and itself:**

&gt;The US/West has a fundamentally different approach towards viewing itself and India.

&gt;It views itself from a top down approach - Starting from a study of the American state (constitution, government, etc), moving on to a study of American nationalism (revolution, civil war, world wars), moving on to a study of American cultural theology (white man's burden, manifest destiny, Christian theology), and finally onto problems in American society (racism, sexism, immigration, treatment of religious minorities).

&gt;However, it views India (go to any India-studies class in the US) from a bottom-up approach - Starting from problems in Indian society (treatment of women, Dalits, religious minorities), ascribes these problems to Hinduism and Hindu theology (caste system, Hindu patriarchy, upper caste ""chauvinism""), which is considered the fundamental block of Indian nationalism (Hindutva, wars against Pakistan) and the Indian state (constitution, government, etc).   

&gt;The top-down approach gives Americans a holistic picture of their own society. Where as the bottom-up approach gives Americans a completely distorted picture of Indian society. The problems in American society are considered flaws where as the problems in India society are considered features.

&gt;And America uses this world view to embarrass India on global forum, proposing that India needs the West to ""save Indians from India"". What this does is it makes Indians (especially Indian-origin Americans or ""Westernized"" Indians) ashamed of being Indians/Hindus. Plenty of them not only reject Hinduism and Indian-ness but they also end up spewing hared towards themselves in order to appear ""modern"", ""civilized"", and ""acceptable"" to their American brethren.

&gt;This obviously creates friction and resentment among Indians towards the West in general and the US in particular.",0,1409491913,null,0,false,0,ck5e7ka,t3_2f2m9q,t1_ck5e7ka,t1_ck5bmzp,null,1427270548,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Nun guck mal was die Russen daraus gemacht haben. Die sitzen schließlich nicht mehr dumm am Rand und schauen zu wie ihre Sicherheitsinteressen missachtet werden wie zu Jelzins Zeiten. 

Nehmen sich einfach einen Teil Europas und richten dort eine Pufferzone ein. Damit haben die alles gewonnen. Die USA haben dafür die Ukraine unter IWF Kontrolle, ebenso die Gasversorgung der Ukraine sowie demnächst Waffenlieferungen bekommen. Das ist natürlich noch nicht alles. 

Die Sanktionen, die hauptsächlich die europäischen Länder aussprechen treffen nur Sie selbst. Die USA profitieren davon. Wie? Nun, so kauft zb seit den Sanktionen Russlands Aeroflot entgegen der Planung neue Maschinen bei Boeing. Keinen Airbus, wie das eigentlich angedacht war.

What Europe is doing with the sanctions is repeating the same thing and expecting a different result, in the mean time hurting its own economy and businesses. 

Do you see declining resistance or do you see Russian tanks entering Ukraine after the last round of sanctions?

Did you see Russians packing it up or military convoys on the border after the one before?

But maybe THIS time it will work, maybe THIS is what he was not expecting all along, ANOTHER round, that will show him. John Mearsheimer has summed it up pretty well in his article on Foreign policy: 

*""History shows that countries will absorb enormous amounts of punishment in order to protect their core strategic interests. There is no reason to think Russia represents an exception to this rule.""*

And this is what EU does not understand. In its neoliberal view of the world it thinks its all about business deals and GDP, after all it is all about ""the economy, stupid"". Except it is not, not for Russia. 

John Kerry, after Russia invaded Crimea said: “You just don’t in the twenty-first century behave in nineteenth-century fashion by invading another country on completely trumped-up pretext.” Of course this was met with ironic remarks regarding USA war in Iraq etc. but what most people missed is that he was completely wrong. Russia behaved exactly like that and remarks saying that they should not will not change a thing. Ever since, EU has been playing the sanction game with no results and expects the next round (maybe not THIS one but definitely the one after!) to work. In the mean time, businesses will suffer, we will start to argue with each other on completely irrevelant topics such as who is proRussian and who is not and the tanks will just roll into Ukraine anyway.

And since you are going to ask me what opinion I support if not sanctions then here:

""One also hears the claim that Ukraine has the right to determine whom it wants to ally with and the Russians have no right to prevent Kiev from joining the West. This is a dangerous way for Ukraine to think about its foreign policy choices. The sad truth is that might often makes right when great-power politics are at play. Abstract rights such as self-determination are largely meaningless when powerful states get into brawls with weaker states. Did Cuba have the right to form a military alliance with the Soviet Union during the Cold War? The United States certainly did not think so, and the Russians think the same way about Ukraine joining the West. It is in Ukraine’s interest to understand these facts of life and tread carefully when dealing with its more powerful neighbor.

Of course, some analysts might concede that NATO handled relations with Ukraine poorly and yet still maintain that Russia constitutes an enemy that will only grow more formidable over time -- and that the West therefore has no choice but to continue its present policy. But this viewpoint is badly mistaken. Russia is a declining power, and it will only get weaker with time. Even if Russia were a rising power, moreover, it would still make no sense to incorporate Ukraine into NATO. The reason is simple: the United States and its European allies do not consider Ukraine to be a core strategic interest, as their unwillingness to use military force to come to its aid has proved. It would therefore be the height of folly to create a new NATO member that the other members have no intention of defending. NATO has expanded in the past because liberals assumed the alliance would never have to honor its new security guarantees, but Russia’s recent power play shows that granting Ukraine NATO membership could put Russia and the West on a collision course.""

The US is sending troops and equipment to Poland and the Baltics, they are just not going to be permanent. You could say the response is tepid, but by far the largest supporter of Eastern European nations has been the NATO member thousands of kilometers away and across an ocean. I would not be surprised if Germany does not send Russia an apology gift basket for the US ""provoking"" it. 

I personally think Eastern NATO members' concerns are being downplayed. This includes by the US, but mostly by Western European countries who keep condescendingly telling them to ""calm down"" as they sit at a safe distance. One could argue that they would be dragged into a war if anything happened, but I am not so sure they would contribute anything until any conflict was dangerously close to their border. 

The UK and France vowed to work more closely together, and Eastern European nations have done the same. That said, most EU members continue to defer their defense onto the US, UK, and France. I have no illusions that this will help create a stronger EU military alliance, even if it does create a couple smaller ones between certain countries. 

My first response was a bit strongly worded. But it gets old constantly hearing about how the US needs to stay out of other countries' business, only to be derided for not doing enough in Europe or another conflict someone cares about. The hypocrisy gets old. Instead of people saying the US should stay out of other countries' conflicts, what they should say is that the US should stay out of conflicts they dont care about.

Considering how central a role the Bosnian civil war continues to have on the country, I think it's especially important that people should be able to have a complete picture of what really happened and such a full understanding can only exist within the historical context that surrounded those tragic events.

To take one example from the article, consider the case of the youth who was surprised to find out the extent of the crimes committed during the Second World War by [Croatian fascists against Serb civilians in Bosnia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_persecution_of_Serbs). While these events may appear to be ancient history today, that was not the case in the early 1990s when the brutal violence was actually within living memory for many Bosnian Serbs and was one of the biggest sources of fear and resentment among the Bosnian Serbian community. It's not too much of a stretch to say that these events were a huge motivating factor for Serbs to rise up in order to remain politically bound with Serbia rather than be part of the new states of Bosnia and Croatia where they would become a minority.  Such attitudes were not abetted when some of the newly formed Croatian military forces, such as the [HOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Defence_Forces) embraced the legacy of Croatian fascists and used the Ustaše slogan (""Za dom spremni"" or ""Ready for the fatherland"") as their own. And believe it or not this was actually the more moderate Bosnian Croatian faction! 

Now imagine looking at the recent conflict like that Croatian youth might have when he was still ignorant of the more distant historical context. How black and white would things may have appeared with Serbians appearing as the clearcut villains and Croatians as innocent defenders.

I didn't actually look at the submission the first time over because all I saw was that it had been submitted wrong. I mean, the main reason we like posts to be submitted as *submissions* rather than as self posts is so that we can use some automoderated procedures to inspect them (usually this consists of adding warning labels if the its from an unrepeatable newspaper like the DM, Fox News or Russia Today, or flagging the moderators if it's a potential spam site or a Godforsaken Lolcat meme or something). But anyway, once you put it through the appropriate channels, another moderator picked up on it and and pointed out the date issue. 

The content kind of falls into a grey area, where it's neither *new*s but also not worth being a self post in and of itself.

The sanctions are not going to do much short term, everyone knew that. You don't immediately hit them with your biggest stick. They are designed to increasingly put pressure on Russia over time. If Putin decides to drive his tanks into Ukraine, there's not much that anyone can do about it without a massive war. However, the West can basically bankrupt Russia to weaken it and make future invasions less likely.

Even the sanctions that ""are not working"" have crashed the ruble and put the Russian economy in recession. Russia needs Europe to buy its energy, to provide the capital to invest in the infrastructure needed to get the energy, and the technology to extract the energy from the arctic reserves that Russia cannot get to by herself. If there are going to be significant sanctions against Russia's key industries, it won't be long until Russia is economically back in the USSR breakup days.

What it boils down to is that Putin thinks he is entitled to the lands in Eastern Europe with Russian minorities (which were in most cases put there forcibly by Staling during the Soviet times), and the West thinks they are not entitled to change the border of sovereign states.

Thing about India is we are a very slow changing society in some aspects. Most of our leaders reflect this and we are slow on the uptake and miss out on lots of opportunities, or ignore them.

Is this not [your subreddit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/srpska/)

&gt; To take one example from the article, consider the case of the youth who was surprised to find out the extent of the crimes committed during the Second World War by Croatian fascists against Serb civilians in Bosnia[1] . While these events may appear to be ancient history today, that was not the case in the early 1990s when the brutal violence was actually within living memory for many Bosnian Serbs and was one of the biggest sources of fear and resentment among the Bosnian Serbian community. It's not too much of a stretch to say that these events were a huge motivating factor for Serbs to rise up in order to remain politically bound with Serbia rather than be part of the new states of Bosnia and Croatia where they would become a minority

So the Kosovo Albanians  were also Ustasa and so were the people in Vojovodina when Milosovic took away there special status in the late 80s within the Republic of Serbia?

Tudman was a Partisan who's brother was killed by the Gestapo for fighting with the Partisan's and so were allot of the leading people behind the Croatian independence movement.  

The HOS was seen as moderate because they did not want to carve up BiH but supported the idea of a independent Bosnia and Herzegovina with it's current borders. This was not supported by the rest of the Croatian leadership who sent a hit squad to take out the commander of the HOS and it was disbanded shorty after. 

 Don't you have a nice Chetnik banner on you subreddit? the same Chetniks that collaborated with the Nazi's and Ustasa during WWII and even pledged allegiance to Ante Pavelic. The same Chetnik's who said the fought for king and fatherland were [rejected](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Vis) by the same king in favour of the Communist Partisan's.

De fait, l'enseignement public qu'on peut considérer comme le tronc commun de la république (càd jusqu'au bac pour l'essentiel) est financé par l'état et a pour but de former des citoyens, et non des travailleurs.

Les revendications des entreprises sont bien gentilles, mais pour la plupart des emplois non spécialisés, qui ne requièrent pas une longue formation académique pour avoir la moindre idée de ce qui se passe dans le domaine, ces revendications sont surtout faites pour avoir des travailleurs tout prêts juste à la sortie de l'école, qui seraient alors interchangeables et par conséquent ""jetables"", ce qui n'est absolument pas réaliste; le problème est que les entreprises ne veulent pas avoir à donner sa chance à un candidat junior, et ne veulent pas assurer une formation initiale, même minimale parce que dès que les notions de risque où de coût sont mentionnées dans une entreprise actuelle, tout le monde bat en retraite. Le fait est qu'aucune formation en milieu scolaire, ni même des stages ne permettent de préparer un élève aux réalités de l'entreprise, donc je ne vois pas vraiment la logique là-dedans.

Les entreprises font la même erreur que certains parents en exigeant que le système scolaire prenne toute l'éducation des jeunes en charge.

En un sens, c'est issu d'un étrange changement de mentalité qui date du siècle dernier, la volonté d'effacer le risque de toute entreprise. Il fût un temps où un marchand mettait toute sa fortune dans un bateau qui allait commercer sur un autre continent, et ramenait d'immenses profits mais avec un risque de voir le bateau couler de 50%; c'était un fait accepté, alors qu'aujourd'hui les investisseurs considèrent que tout investissement devrait être sûr à 100%, et toujours rapporter gros sans aucun risque; cf les refus véhéments de restructurer la dette grecque alors que tout le monde savait qu'elle était pourrie depuis des années et comportait donc des risques, d'autant que le rendement était élevé. Pour embaucher, c'est pareil, il faut prendre un risque, mais peut-être que le type qui n'a eu son bac que de justesse et est au chômage depuis 2 ans sera parfait pour une boîte, et peut-être que le type qui sort d'une grande école est juste un gros gland improductif.

There is no point in cancelling that contract unless US is willing to buy them (some said they were, but US Congress did not agree to do so). Not giving Mistrals to Russia won't change anything. A real change would be to stop buying natural resources from Russia, one by one until gas goes last. Of course, since such sanctions will actually hurt the EU instead of just pissing off Russia, the EU doesn't have the balls for them (yet). 

Though let's be honest, if you were the head of the gov't in France/Germany, why would you agree to a sanction that possibly sends you back into a double-dip recession, causes deaths in your country and gets your own gov't voted out?

true,ElSelby,lombardia,null,"&gt; Sei abbastanza disinformato riguardo il paintball, ma purtroppo in Italia è normale.

Infatti l'ho detto, più che altro non mi ha mai attirato molto, il perchè te lo spiego sotto.

&gt; In Italia il paintball è regolamentato dallo CSEN (te lo linko, ma al momento il sito è in manutenzione per l'inizio della nuova stagione) ed è attivissimo come disciplina agonistica grazie all'IPBS.

Boh, non mi ispira proprio, ok ci sta il fatto che ci sono gare e che, ma forse proprio perchè vivo il softair più come gioco/passione, non mi attira l'idea di giocare in un campo con vari oggetti qua e la(sicuramente avranno un criterio).
Anche perchè a livello competitivo preferisco gli sport individuali, se vinco è merito soltanto mio, se perdo la colpa è solamente mia. 
Piuttosto mi ispirano le milsim del softair, alla fine sono gusti.


&gt; Diciamo che se vuoi praticare il paintball come semplice passatempo, è esattamente come il softair: ci vai con gli amici ogni tanto, sai quello che spendi, fai qualcosa di diverso.

Come passatempo tra amici(inteso quelli della compagnia) ce lo vedo, ma come passione, non fa per me.

&gt; Personalmente il lasertag mi annoia molto, sarà che la componente del dolore reciproco nel paintball ti molla delle sberle di adrenalina non indefferenti.

Esatto, manca la componente fisica, che un raggio laser non ti da.

These rights are fundamental and absolute, and exist regardless of the ability to defend or exercise them. Russia has no right to dictate to them whether they can or cannot join NATO/EU or any other group they want. That's the very basic, foundational principle of international law.

J'aurais dût employé le terme pubs ou publiques je pense, parce que le terme ladder peut porté à confusion effectivement.


En gros c'est juste une partie classée, le jeu te classe par rapport à tous les joueurs, quand tu gagnes tu montes, quand tu perds tu descends. Le plus souvent c'est un système similaire au classement Elo utilisé pour les échecs. Certains jeux ont aussi un système de ligues et de saisons mais le principe est le même, plus tu gagnes, plus t'es mieux classé, plus le niveau augmente, plus t'es un bogoss. Et évidement t'affrontes des joueurs avec un classement similaire au tiens.


Et les parties ladder (ou publique) où tu joues contre de parfaits inconnus dans des modes de jeux qui sont pas forcément ceux utilisés en compétitions sont à différenciés des clans wars/scrims où là tu crées un lobby privé pour affronter une équipe/joueur spécifique, tu test des stratégies, tu demandes au joueur en face de faire telle ou telle strat pour voir si les idées que t'as pour les contrer sont pas mal etc. 


Au final le ladder c'est juste le moyen le plus simple pour te faire une partie viteuf, hop le jeu te sélectionne un mec, te dit ""vazy bat le"" et s'arrange pour que le combat soit équilibré. Si t'es dans une équipe/clan tu vas scrim avec ton équipe en prévision d'une compétition quelconque et ça se fait pas en partie publique mais en privé et le résultats n'a aucune incidence sur ton classement ladder.

Has it crossed your mind that there might have been a valid reason for that ? And that massacring and jailing opponents and rights activits in the most Putinist way routinely did not really helped long time ?

Where are we now ? On the verge of the next part of the same recession, because there's still not enough money in the system to buy things with and therefore keep corporations afloat by selling stuff.

Actually inflation was starting before, and went that bad because they printed all of it instead of asking employers to pay any amounty of taxes. When you twice the money pool, you halve the value. 

Btw, we are not in recession this time, next year we'll be in deflation. Limited printing and better wages IS the only solution if you want anyone to be able to buy anything and therefore the economy to cycle.

You were talking about how empires affect negatively the standard of living so anything that raises the standard of living must not be an empire. I focused on that, and I didn't even approach the definition of ""standard of living"" and how it applies to NATO or not. Even ignoring this, I showed that your point is invalid because some empires have raised the standard of living, in their context obviously.

Now you're talking about friendliness and saying the act of invading is what distinguishes empires from friendly military occupation. My reply to that is that a modern empire is built on political and economic influence, not subjugation and outright control, so it's only logic that a modern empire comes about through ""friendlier"" means.

As for the Moorish empire in the Iberian Peninsula there aren't impartial accounts of the events surrounding the invasion. At the time of the invasion the Peninsula was composed of various proto-Christian tribes that fought each other on a regular basis. The Moors were just another enemy, they didn't unite against them. It was just a big cluster of rivalries there. Had they united into one military force, the Moors would have stayed in North Africa.

But the Moors invaded and stayed in the Peninsula for centuries and then fought against what they rightfully perceived after all that time in peace as Catholic invaders claiming land because Christians had lived there (much like the Russians want to control parts of Ukraine for having Russians living there). Accounts of Portuguese and Spanish conquests tell the stories of the people living in Moorish lands who weren't particularly bothered by whomever ruled them.

Dès les années 90 quand j'étais au collège, le discours c'était : ""A 12 ans vous devez savoir quel métier vous ferez plus tard et choisir tout votre parcours scolaire en fonction de ça. Alors faites bien gaffe si vous choississez allemand au lieu d'anglais ou vice-versa ce sera trop tard après pour faire marche arrière!"" etc, etc.

&gt;J'ai peut-être eu de la malchance par rapport aux enseignants que j'ai &gt;eu mais c'est l'impression que j'ai eu jusqu'à la fin du lycée, dans 90% &gt;des cas, on ne nous demandait pas de comprendre mais d'apprendre &gt;... des dates, des listes, des personnages, des règles et il fallait les &gt;recracher à l'identique.

Oui et non.      
Pour moi le discours, tout au long de la scolarité, c'était ""il ne faut pas apprendre mais comprendre"". Je me souviens même d'un prof de maths qui insistait pour qu'on ne révise pas nos leçons à la veille d'un contrôle. Si on avait compris en cours, c'était bon.       
Voilà pour le discours, mais le fait est que dans la réalité, c'était pas toujours vrai. Surtout à la fac, l'endroit où paraît-il le plus important est le travail personnel, la recherche, ne pas se limiter au cours lire soi-même des livres sur ceci et cela.       
En première année je suis passé mais un peu juste. En seconde année j'ai changé de méthode : aller à tous les cours, apprendre par coeur et rien d'autre à côté (j'avais pas le temps tte façon). Et bien ça a marché pour au moins la majorité des cours, je suis passé de notes juste au-dessus de la moyenne à des 15, 16...

Précisions quand même : j'ai une mémoire de merde. J'oublie ce que j'ai entendu il y a 10 minutes. Donc pour retenir quelque chose (des dates, des détails...) il faut que je me l'enfonce de force dans le crâne. C'est pas forcément le cas pour certains élèves à qui il suffit d'entendre ou de lire juste une fois pour le retenir instantanément (j'ai cru noter que les élèves en filière S passaient beaucoup moins de temps à réviser que ceux en ES, L. Et ce parce qu'ils retenaient tout facilement.)         
D'autre part, apprendre ""par coeur"" n'est pas forcément bête. Pour moi ça veut dire que le cours écrit sur le cahier doit être recopié dans la tête à la virgule près.        
Mais ça n'empêche pas après l'analyse et la compréhension. La seule différence étant qu'on le fait en pensée au lieu de le faire en lisant.

Send a card or a postcard, or even a simple phone call. If you're young (meaning under 40), they won't expect anything and probably won't think anything of it. The key here is you must simply voice your thanks and simply show appreciation, and you don't have to do this by buying things because it comes across as you're doing it out of guilt or, even worse, putting them in a position where they feel they have to reciprocate.

In our Anglo culture, whether you're American, from the UK, Australian, Canadian, etc. (I'm American, btw, and I live in Italy), the onus is on US to show the appreciation and to nearly serve our hosts (which is kinda stupid, actually). In Italy, the onus is on the host, as if it's a ""the customer is always right"" scenario. Ironically, business in Italy is most certainly NOT this way, haha! However, hosting family and friends most certainly is. The pressure is on THEM to be gracious hosts because they wouldn't want to ""make a brutta figura"" with guests.

&gt; 
&gt; Du tust so, als würdest du dich weitläufig in allen Medien informieren aber letzen Endes läuft es so ab:
&gt; 
&gt; Du liest westliche Medien&gt;&gt;&gt;Die sind ja sowieso alle bezahlte Affen, die Hälfte ist gelogen
&gt; 
&gt; Dann liest du Propaganda&gt;&gt;&gt;Die sind zwar auch bezahlte Affen, aber mir gefällt ihre Version besser weil sie gegen den Westen ist


Naja siehste das mein ich, so ist es genau eben nicht. Ich glaube lediglich, dass wenn z.B. PressTV über Israel schreibt, dass es aus Hass und Ablehnung gegen den Zionismus geschrieben wird. Und ich bin mir dabei sehr bewusst, aus welcher Ecke das kommt. Das schöne daran ist, dass auch wenn teilweise unhaltbare Sachen geschrieben werden, dass man eine ernstgemeinte Meinung aus einer ganz anderen Perspektive sieht. 

PressTV und die NYT z.B. sind sehr unterschiedlich und antagonistisch. Und wenn ich kritische Informationen über Palästina lesen will, dann les ich doch sicherlich nicht die NYT wovon 2/3 CEOs Juden sind, sondern den Guardian für eine generelle Richtung, Al Jazeera für eine lokalere/muslimische oder PressTV für die antagonistische und anti-zionistische Meinung. Und NATÜRLICH muss man immer bedenken was von wem kommt. 

Aber ich les doch nicht die Meinung von Anhängern eines Krieges gegen Zivilisten. Da könnt ich ja gleich den STÜRMER lesen um Informationen über den Stand der Operation Barbarossa zu erfahren.


&gt;Anstatt sich also eingehend zu informieren, suchst du dir einfach nur jeweils den Artikel raus der deinem Weltbild passt und stempelst den Rest als Lüge ab.

Richtig. Und du hast auch dein Weltbild und du konsumierst Informationen auch nur so wie sie dir passen. Wenn du etwas kritisches über den Gaza-Konflikt liest, was nicht in dein ""alle Araber und Muslime sind Terroristen"" (überspitzt, rhetorisch) Weltbild passt, dann liest du auch nicht weiter, weil du es als Schund diskreditierst.

Und wenn ein Günther Grass wegen eines pro-Israelischen und anti-kriegs und anti-zionistischen Gedichts von allen Medien verteufelt wird, dann weiß man schon wie der Hase läuft. Hast du dir mal das Gedicht durchgelesen oder die Passage? Günther Grass ist inzwischen ein Nazi und taucht nirgends mehr in den Mainstream Medien auf. Zionismus hat mehr Ähnlichkeit mit Nationalsozialismus und Nationalismus als mit allem anderen.

Und ja, ich bin sehr kritisch gegen den Zionismus und Zionisten und Amerika, welche diese Barbarei unterstützen und Waffen liefern, welche gegen Zivilisten eingesetzt werden, aber gleichzeitig bin ich auch pro-Israel und mag die jüdische Kultur nicht nur auf dem Papier. Ich kann von mir behaupten jüdische Freunde und Bekannte zu haben, ich habe mich schon mit einigen intelligenten Juden sehr kritisch über den Zionismus unterhalten, kannst du das von dir behaupten?

Wer nicht sieht, dass unsere Medien genau so gleichgeschalten sind, nur in anderen Bereichen der ist blind. Es ist alles subjektiv und es gibt keine absolute Meinung.

The people fighting the Moors before Portugal and Spain were mainly an invading tribe, the Visigoths who ruled most of the Peninsula for 3 centuries (much like the Moors rulled 3 centuries after that).

There was another tribe, the Suebi, that had invaded the Peninsula like the Visigoths, who fought back against the Visigoths *and* against the Moors. They managed to hold back in what is now northern Portugal, Galicia and Asturias. Part of their success came down to the fact that the Suebi were much more lenient on local tribes who sided with them against the Visigoths and Moors.

When the Moors invaded the Peninsula, people from these invading tribes (Suebi and Visigoths) either died fighting back or fled to Europe (some of the Suebi also obviously held back in those northern regions I mentioned). The people who stayed under Moorish rule were the Lusitanians and Iberians, the same people who had been invaded by Romans, then by the Visigoths and Suebi (among other invading tribes; too many to mention here).

These people weren't treated like hostile people by the Moors because they had lived like plebes under Visigothic rule, removed from any wealth or military power. They had nothing to fight for and no means to fight even. They lived in similar conditions under Moorish rule and later under Portuguese and Spanish rule, the difference with the latter being their integration in society through the emergent Portuguese nationality, culture and religion (in Spain it came down to religion only, because the Moors left a much bigger cultural influence and Spain wasn't a country, but rather a group of kingdoms).

So basically, the people of the Peninsula weren't treated any worse by the Moors then they were before and after Moorish conquest. This invalidates your original point about the Moors treating local people in a particularly bad manner.

But centuries later the Moors obviously fought back against the invading European armies (Portuguese and Spanish royal family came from modern France and the Crusaders from the UK), which is obvious if you have some historic perspective.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Fiscal_Studies

&gt; The Institute came into existence because four financiers - a banker and Conservative Party politician (Will Hopper), an investment trust manager (Bob Buist), a stockbroker (Nils Taube) and a tax consultant (John Chown) - were appalled at the way in which the 1965 Finance Act became law.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Act_1965

Yup, more old billionnaires who want to be tax free.

Employers lying about the ""employment free market"" and colluding with corrupt politicians to squeeze more money from everyone who would low ball numbers ? N E V E R /s

&gt;  In 1990, the Institute moved to Ridgmount Street. In 1991, the ESRC Centre was inaugurated. In 1994, the Tax Law Review Committee was established.

I dont know that much, and this wont be very refined.. One idea is to decrease NATO involvement in Russia-bordering countries to merely a defense-pact with NATO. Also, the EU involvement with those countries could be stopped, any further developments should be on equal footing with Russia's ability to trade. Putin could take this as his victory, a way out for their egos and narrative.

That would be our side of the deal, their side is that they fuck off out Ukraine, and stay out all of those countries. I suppose you could ask to not try corrupt or push political forces, but that is hard to check, i think.

&gt; I disagree on your comments about the Moors. There absolutely was issues between Muslims and Catholics. 

Then you're not disagreeing with my comments. If you were willing to read or willing to accept the nuances of the subject, you would realize this. Maybe you think you disagree because you haven't made the distinction between the Moorish invasion and the Catholic invasion (labeled Reconquest by Catholic propaganda from then on).

When Moors invaded the Peninsula, there were no Catholics. Catholicism was taking its very first baby steps. Religion in the Peninsula was mainly pagan with a little bit of proto-Christianism here and there. The invasion of European monarchs who founded and expanded Portugal and Spain wasn't a Reconquest (let alone a Catholic Reconquest) because this was the first time either they and Catholicism had set foot in the Peninsula.

Like I said above, the Moors didn't do anything special to the local people they conquered, because these people didn't fight against Moors, their previous rulers (Visigoths and Suebi) did. Visigoths either died fighting Moors or fled to Europe. The Suebi managed to hold back in the north because they had militarily empowered local tribes under their rule. Other smaller tribes also held back in that region. Moors treated conquered tribes like Catholics did when they got there centuries later, and like Visigoths had treated them before all that.

Only later when Portugal and Spain were created and Catholicism was already very well organized and expanded, did Moors and Catholics fight each other.

Both Portugal and Spain invaded Moorish land and the Moors fought back. So only in this instance can you say the Moors attacked Catholics, which is not saying much, since Catholics were invading a region that had been Moorish for 3 centuries (and parts of it stayed Moorish for 5 more centuries) and peaceful for part of these 3 centuries. It's only logical that the Moors would fight back.

true,Quirite,null,null,"Trust me, you won't have any problem whatsoever in finding some pub crawl - especially in or around piazza Campo de' Fiori. This said, you should be warned that public drunkenness is still pretty much inacceptable in Italy, although things are slowly changing with the younger generations. Also, beware - sometimes Campo de' Fiori can get a bit of a boxing ring because of the many foreign exchange students getting drunk and picking fights.

As far as beers are concerned... even though I don't usually like to drink, I find the *Ichnusa* brand (from Sardinia) to be rather good. I don't know about draught beers, as I'm a total noob when it comes to these things!

Here are a few more (and hopefully useful) tips:

* Learn how to cross the street safely as soon as possible. I had some American friends over and they didn't quite get the timing right - but crossing with droves of other people will be of great help.

* Lots of restoration works going on this year (Coliseum, Trevi fountain).

* Public transit is **NOT** free, even though it may seem so. ATAC tickets/passes - covering pretty much every form of transportation in city - are inexpensive if compared to those of most European capitals and ticket checkers do, in fact, check who's got a ticket and who's not (even if randomly). 

* You might also think that locals cheat the system just because nobody seems to be validating their tickets on the bus... but this is patently false. Most of us do have monthly/yearly passes that require no validation (except on the Metro).

* Remember to validate your ATAC ticket on the bus/tram/trolleybus otherwise you'll be fined.

* And if you do buy a weekly/monthly pass, write your name on it: you can be fined for that, too.

* You can't buy ATAC tickets on the bus (but you can do so on some of the newer trams).

* Try to avoid the Metro, and especially line B, at rush hour (7:30 - 9:00 AM). If you really have to take it, know that the last cars are - generally speaking - less crowded. Forget looking for a seat at that hour.

* If you're planning on visiting a restaurant, know that the *coperto* charge is illegal in Rome and the surrounding Lazio region. If you still find that charge on your bill, threaten to call the *Guardia di Finanza* (Italy's tax police; phone #**117**) until the restaurateur backs off. 

* Being charged for bread is totally legitimate, but if you don't want to pay for it just refuse that already on your table or send back any bread the waiter brings you.

* Touristy cafés will charge you more if you sit down. Neighbourhood bars won't.

* Avoid any and all restaurants/cafés/gelaterie in front of the Vatican Museums, on via della Conciliazione or in the via Cavour, near Termini. These are notorious for fleecing tourists.

* Of course, *Giolitti* sucks donkey balls. Don't believe your guidebook.

* Roman pizzas are thinner and crispier than the ""classic"" Neapolitan pizza. Don't listen to those who say it isn't real pizza - they don't know what they're talking about - and try it out instead. 

* *Supplì* (fried rice balls with mozzarella and tomato), a pizza and a bottle of beer are a wonderful combo.

* It is not customary to order for tap water at the restaurant, and you'll have to pay for it.

* Do not for the love of God ever buy snacks/water from the many carts located near the major monuments; these all belong to a rather dishonest city councilor and you wouldn't want to fatten his wallet any further. Same goes with the chestnut vendors you can see in the historical centre every winter.

* Really, taking a photo with the centurions isn't worth it. They're rude, obnoxious, are working illegally and will almost certainly rip you off. Besides, their ""armours"" are laughable... at best.

* Tap water in Rome is good and safe to drink; you can save money by refilling your bottle at the many small, cast-iron fountains called *nasoni*. In order to drink from them, place your finger over the end of the spout and a stream of water will spurt upwards through a hole on top of the pipe.

* The Xmas market at piazza Navona is a total sham, and so is the open-air market at Campo de' Fiori.

* Rose sellers and beggars can sometimes be very insistent... do not hesitate to shoo them away rudely.

* The area around Termini isn't, actually, as dangerous as you might have heard. Caution is advised in the station itself, though, as gypsies like to concentrate - and operate - there.

* Beware of fake taxis. Legitimate ones are white, have the [city's coat of arms](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/archive/d/d9/20120421223242!Roma-Stemma.png) painted on the car's door, a meter and a taxi light on the roof. There are **taxi ranks** from which you can safely board one, so ignore all the touts at the airport! 

* Yes, there's definitely graffiti around the city but this doesn't mean that a particular district is dangerous; there are no gangs or ghettoes to speak of. Just pay attention to pickpockets in the historical centre.

* Both A/C and heater usage are regulated by the government so don't be surprised if you find the premises too hot/cold for your liking; we import gas and electricity from elsewhere and these things don't come cheap.

* Need some medical attention? Feel free to pop into the Tourist Medical Guard post located at the *Nuovo Regina Margherita* hospital (on via Emilio Morosini, 30 - Trastevere district). It's open 24/7 and it's free.

* If it's a **real** medical emergency, then just call an ambulance (**118**). 

* Just get used to *Carabinieri* armed with sub-machineguns. Everything is fine and they're not after you (yet).

* I suppose I don't really have to tell you this, but you shouldn't dip your feet in the fountains. It's illegal.

* Somebody call the police! (*Carabinieri*: **112**; Police: **113**). Note that the *Carabinieri*, despite the many jokes about them, are actually quite good at their job and quicker than the Police.

* Have fun!

Juste, pour rajouter une précision :  l'odd ratio de 1.78 que tu cites a en fait été obtenu par les mecs de la MILDT *toutes doses de THC confondues*, et est associé au risque d'être *responsable* d'un accident automobile, et non d'être juste impliqué dans un accident. Il faut également noter que cette incidence statistique s'avère nettement inférieure à celle de la conduite en alcoolémie *légale* (&lt; 0.5g/l), qui est de 2.70, et passe à plus de 6.2 pour une alcoolémie simplement contraventionnelle (0.5 &lt; c &lt; 0.8 g/l). 

Autrement dit, conduire sous l'influence d'une substance (l'éthanol) qui multiplie par plus de 6 le risque de provoquer un accident est infiniment moins grave selon le droit Français que conduire sous l'influence d'une autre substance (le THC) qui ne fait au plus que doubler ce risque : contraventionnel vs délictuel.

If only there was no NATO, European politicians couldn't lay back but would have to do more themselves for defence instead of letting the US do all the work and doing things on EU level would give the EU more control over the direction of its military force.

So imho a little less NATO would not be a bad thing. Not that it should go completely, but European politicians could use a shock when it comes to defence, especially now.

1) I was and am against the invasion of Crimea and Ukraine by Russia, and I believe so are a lot of people in Kazakhstan. Putin really didn't think this through and now there are all sorts of consequences that are mostly hurting average Russian citizens. Our politicians can't say a lot against it though because Russia is massive in population, land and economic terms. So politically it is safer if we play it nice.

2) Putin did say that Kazakhs didn't have a sovereign statehood before the Soviet Union, which is true and false depending on how you look at it. We were divided into three fractions known as zhuz (жұз), which Soviet Army consolidated under force; however, they were linked to each other and were known as Great, Middle and Little Zhuz. So, I believe we did have a statehood before the Soviet invasion.

3) While the comment is definitely worrying, it was made as a compliment to our President. What Putin said was that our President (loose translation follows) ""is one of smartest politicians in post-Soviet territory who achieved a remarkable thing by building the first Kazakh statehood when there was no such thing before the Soviet Union, and helping it prosper."" The rest are other points complimenting his policy, but overall the comment itself was mentioned only as a side note.

4) That being said, I think a lot of people in Kazakhstan, including me, are worried that something like this can happen to Kazakhstan as well. Obviously, I hope Putin understands now how costly it is to invade another country, but he seems like a madman, so who knows.

He's an absolutely fascinating man.

Rather than sit there and wait out his sentence until China took over in 1997, he took it upon himself to pass legislation that rewrote Hong Kong's Basic Law to allow for greater freedom of speech for individuals and the press. 

But I think what I admire him most for is the fact that he's never towed the party line. He's openly rebelled against the Conservatives a number of times. In his book *What Next?

Non è difficile credere che lo stesso avvenga con due genitori dello stesso sesso: il problema degli orfani (oltre alla mancanza di uno dei genitori) è la mancanza di una figura materna o paterna nella loro vita. E non è neanche difficile capirne il motivo: nella società ci sono sia uomini che donne e nella vita bisogna saper interagire con entrambi i sessi, crescere senza madre o padre significa non relazionarsi con figure adulte di un certo sesso con la stessa frequenza dei coetanei, il che, come ho già scritto, porta a vari problemi che si protraggono anche nell'età adulta.

Dato che non c'è certo una mancanza di coppie etero in cerca di bambini da adottare, non vedo perché rischiare di compromettere lo sviluppo di una persona senza alcun vantaggio (i.e. il bambino viene comunque adottato), soprattutto considerando che per un paese come il nostro l'unica cosa che è rimasta è la speranza di un futuro migliore.",0,1409510020,null,0,false,0,ck5lc2x,t3_2f2tzz,t1_ck5lc2x,t1_ck5gc3z,null,1427267154,-1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,-1

Have you not seen Merkels reaction to this whole thing? Not only has the UK gone over her head and created a new military just to stick a middle finger up at Russia but has pushed for sanctions and got them. These sanctions exclude the finance industry. Go look at 'The Economist' article about who pushed for sanctions... (hint it wasn't the Germans).

""nothing really happens in the EU without Germany's consent""

Economically in the Euro-zone if France agrees, then nothing happens without French/German help. The UK doing QE shows German economic policy doesn't quite apply to us. Germany is put as the leader in economic terms... you must be joking if you think when someone is talking to Germany in a crises that they are listening to what Germany does. Germany isn't a foreign policy major actor, the UK and France are and most of the time don't care for what Germany thinks when it comes to foreign policy. You want proof take a look at Libya or Iraq. Face it, Germany can't even keep southern Europe in line... even the French basically just stuck the middle finger up at you on the budget 3% target.

Contrary to what you may like to think even France and Germany together to not get what they want... and Germany alone barely get's what it wants and in foreign policy.. well they aren't even listened to seriously because it's common knowledge Germany won't back up any threat they would make.

Location : Moselle (some french backwater)

Contract : Limited length (24 months)

Experience : begginers

Languages : Perfect German is needed (the way it's said means : if you are not quasi native speaker, don't even dare apply) ; Excellent english required

Wage : 800 to 1100 before taxes (you get 500 to 800 € once the employer paid it's taxes) (yeah that's the latest scam, the ""raw wage"". The employer add his employing taxes on top of your wage to inflate the number of paper but pay you only 70% of that really)

Weekly Work time : 35h (""2 days a week"") (expect 60h irl)

Type of company : Has 200-249 employees

Annnd that's the kind of job we push our kids on.

For your info, the rent in a big french town is easily 600-1000€/month alone. Not even counting utilities.

Also, if you ""refuse"" too many ""valid"" offers, the unemployment agency can end all your benefits on a whim (&gt; no income &gt; homeless. I hope you have family to take you back in).

So we're not loud about it but news outlets in those countries affected might circlejerk this topic.


Well, to add my own anecdote, the original debunking prooferred the bail out as evidence of Germany's compassion. At the very least, the German view of the bail out is at odds with how it would be viewed in Southern Europe. 

&gt;You still have to remember that the Euro and its mechanisms have been forced upon Germany as a price for France's agreement to reunion and eventually withdrawal of troops from German soil. It is nothing we wanted but have adapted to. The blame for the lack of help towards economically inferior countries has to be directed to Paris, not Berlin.

This both shirks any blame that might fall on Germany, a point I highlighted earlier, and ignores the fact that Germany is the main bulwark against the mechanisms that are necessary to make the Eurozone stable. Also, calling a country 'economically inferior' is exactly the type of rhetoric and language that leads to Germany being called arrogant. 

&gt;The trade surplus however was at same levels before we had the Euro, by the way

I didn't say that you got the surplus because of the Euro; I said it was at its current level because of the Euro. The DM would have been stronger and the surplus would have decreased due to that difference in the system. In any case, now that the system is so fundamentally different, the transfers have become a necessity. Without them, the bailouts and painful austerity-led internal devaluations are a necessity. German politicians and the German people cannot claim to be behind the existence of the Euro if they are not behind its necessary requisites. Anything else is self-delusion. 

&gt;Noone will invest in a country where bribery is still on rampant levels, the public sector still generous and the tax evasion rate barely tackled.

Back to the lazy rhetoric of the Merkel and co and ignoring the economists. It is not a lack of investment which leads to these crises, or the bribery and public-office largesse. They worsen the situation but they are not the cause. The originator is a poorly constructed currency zone. Focussing only on the factors that make the situation worse is not going to cure the problem and its disingenuous to state otherwise.

&gt; Catholic and Christian are one in the same.

Not only is this wrong now as it was wrong then. At the time there were plenty of Christian doctrines trying to spread across the land. In fact, the Crusaders went to Jerusalem because other Christian doctrines existed close to that region and the Catholic Church knew that controlling the ""Holy Land"" would boost their power.

The Iberian Peninsula happened to be on their way.

&gt; Also, the area was most definitely Catholic, the kingdom that was invaded by the Moors was Catholic.

Visigoths and other foreign ruling tribes may have thought themselves as Catholics, but the locals kept their pagan practices. Just like they kept them when Moors ruled them. If you're saying that constitutes a Catholic people then you'd have to say they were Muslims when the Moors ruled them, which is factually wrong and you have already denied. You can't have double-standards like that.

In fact, the Moors didn't try to convert people as much as Visigoths did. 

When the Portuguese and Spanish monarchs (of French origin) decided to grab land in the Peninsula they had to convert and indoctrinate locals to Catholicism from paganism with both Christian and Islamic influences. This shows perfectly well that the locals weren't Catholics. There was no **Re**conquest. It was a religiously motivated political and military conquest of land with the objective of spreading the Catholic empire based on the impetuosity of conquering land and power that was common to all monarchs/nobles/powerful families.

The self-claimed Catholics the Moors attacked when they invaded the Peninsula were themselves invaders of the Peninsula. And the Catholics the Moors attacked at the end of their rule were again Catholic invaders from other parts of Europe. Local people were seldom bothered by Moors, let alone subjugated to anything specially bad compared to what Visigoths did and what the Catholic monarchies did after Moorish rule. 

Your original argument that Moors were horrible to local people and didn't ""raise their standard of living"" is simply invalid and false. All foreign ruling peoples (Visigoths, Moors, and Catholics) all were equally horrible to locals in their own way and all raised the standard of living with social and technological innovations (as much as possible at the time).",0,1409514172,null,0,false,0,ck5n6y4,t3_2f2y30,t1_ck5n6y4,t1_ck5m5px,null,1427266286,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The gov cracked down on those after serious rioting (law was passed, making paying internship mandatory past a few weeks IIRC), so now most offer exclusively the strict legal minimum after a fiscal assembly full of loophole to pay about 60% of the minimal the law intended as a spirit. ""Middle class wages"" effectively don't exist anymore for most of my generation.

&gt;  and suggest that's offer for students or young people living with their parents still. 

Problem is, most offers do suggest that. And that's how you end up with 30y old workers who still can't afford a flat and live at their parents'.

The debt came from spending 400 billion on Military after the Cyprus invasion, while most countries in Europe have barely spent 20-40 billion$ in the last 30ish years on Military, Greece was forced to spend 400 billion due to a major foreign threat on its territory(which is also why Greece rushed into the EU unprepared)

Greece has had its military spending cut and it is still one of only three countries in Europe that meet the 2% required NATO spending threshold,  (Poland has met the 2% this year for first time making it the fourth in Europe now*)

&gt;A __surrogacy__ arrangement or surrogacy agreement is the carrying of a [pregnancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy) for intended parents. There are two main types of surrogacy, [gestational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational) surrogacy and traditional surrogacy. In gestational surrogacy, the pregnancy results from the transfer of an [embryo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo) created by [*in vitro* fertilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation) (IVF), in a manner so the resulting child is genetically unrelated to the surrogate. Gestational surrogates are also referred to as gestational carriers. In traditional surrogacy, the surrogate is impregnated naturally or artificially, but the resulting child is genetically related to the surrogate. In the United States, gestational surrogacy is more common than traditional surrogacy and is considered less legally complex.

Things might be different if you were to replace the US with Russia, let's just say. Remember Libya? European NATO nations were involved and while we were reluctant, we still joined our partners in Europe. The US-NATO relationship is not a one-way street that alot of people make it out to be. Further, I can tell you that a European-based wing working within the confines of NATO (like the recent UK-led NATO reaction force to EE) has more strength, reputation, and backing than an EU-based force.

true,TheDukeofReddit,null,null,"The persecution existed in a vastly different environment than what we can understand today.  We do not even have to use the 'it was a different culture' to excuse it.  Rather, since Islams inception, the Muslims had waged almost constant and unending holy war on Christians.  North Africa, Egypt, the Levant, Anatolia, the regions near the Caucasus mountains, and Mesopotamia, had nearly all been Christian or had large Christian populations. By the time the Spanish Inquisition came about, 1471, Islam had been in disarray.  It was a real threat that Muslims arms would return in force, as the Ottomans would take up the title of Caliphate soon enough.

What the Iberians did face after centuries of conflict were centuries more of piracy and slavery.  Imagine having to live in an environment where at any time your entire town could be either butchered, looted, or enslaved.  Where people could appear at any time to carry you away.  But how do these people get inside of the gates? How do they know that the lord and his garrison are away? When they attack your trade ships, how do they know what route they will be taking and when?  Often times, a ransom was available.  How did they know who to ransom? Millions of Europeans were carried into slavery during this time period.

So centuries of warfare and centuries more of raids created a rather harsh reaction.  Was it right? Probably not, but it is certainly a lot easier to judge them from today than it would be from centuries ago.  Not because the culture was different, but that our security is a luxury not enjoyed by our predecessors.  Even today none of us react well to such predation.  I mean, how do you feel about what is happening to the Yazidis? Or the beheading of James Foley? Now imagine that ISIL was regularly coming to Germany to do such things.  Abducting people by the thousands to take back to Syria and Iraq to rape, murder, and ransom. Now imagine that such an act wasn't simply a one off thing like 9/11, but went on for decades.

Weirdly, it says that some 40,000 of them (or over a quarter) came from ""Other parties"" (Sonstige). That seems hard to believe considering those [only pooled some 120,000 votes](http://www.wahlrecht.de/news/2009/landtagswahl-sachsen-2009.htm) in 2009, and the main ones were the Tierschutzpartei and the Piraten.

(Further charts for voter exchange data by party [are here](http://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2014-08-31-LT-DE-SN/analyse-wanderung.shtml#16_Wanderung_AFD).)

&gt;

&gt;__Betteridge's law of headlines__ is an [adage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adage) that states: ""Any [headline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headline) which ends in a [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark) can be answered by the word *no*."" It is named after Ian Betteridge, a British technology journalist,  although the general concept is much older.  The observation has also been called ""__Davis' law__""   or just the ""__journalistic principle__"".  In the field of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics), the concept has been referred to as __Hinchliffe's Rule__  since before 1988.

Really, there are just two ways to get out of the country, train and plane (unless you have a car and are willing to drive - unlikely). The train line is Trenitalia, they have several high speed trains, and I believe a few cheaper ones as well. They go to most major Italian cities, with international transfers as well. They can be a little costly; for me, going from Rome to Lugano was about 180e round trip. 

You can also fly, of course. There are a lot of cheap airlines that have flights going out from Rome, like EasyJet or RyanAir. It's sometimes cheaper to fly, or to fly and then take a train in some combination, than to just take the train. Obviously, the farther you travel, the more expensive it becomes - Dublin will be expensive. Brussels will be manageable.

In short, just hunt down cheap air fare, combine air fare with train tickets, maybe take a flight that leaves very early or very late.

Places like Iraq and Syria had ""Multi-Culturalism"" for decades with Shia, Sunni, Christians living together but once the Sunnis got majority population they went ape-shit and went to War with everyone else for dominance of the country. The only thing holding back Iraq from mayhem in the 80/90's was a brutal dictator, once he was gone the mayhem began. 

Places like Poland/Greece with 90-95% homogenous/same religion populations and refusal to accept ""Multi-Cult"" ideology have the best chance to avoid the Iraq scenario Sweden/UK/France is facing. 

There are already signs of this upcoming struggle with hundreds of massive ghettos in France/UK/Sweden being ""no-mans land"" for police/authorities and where Islamic fundamentalists rule in their own fiefdoms. 

What is need to survive the shit-storm of the future is not only the complete avoidance of Multi-Cultural ideology but the complete opposite with an intense grasp on traditional values and culture which places like Greece and Poland have in abundance. 

Countries were formed for a reason, it took tens of thousands of years to create UK/Sweden/France and only 50 years to destroy them from within, there is no going back through peaceful methods and it is all downhill from here for them.

---

&gt;

&gt;Ethical issues that have been raised with regards to surrogacy include: 

&gt;


&gt;* To what extent should society be concerned about exploitation, commodification, and/or coercion when women are paid to be pregnant and deliver babies, especially in cases where there are large wealth and power differentials between intended parents and surrogates?

&gt;* To what extent is it right for society to permit women to make contracts about the use of their bodies?


&gt;


&gt;* To what extent is it a woman's human right to make contracts regarding the use of her body?

&gt;* Is contracting for surrogacy more like contracting for employment/labor, or more like contracting for prostitution, or more like contracting for slavery?

&gt;* Which, if any, of these kinds of contracts should be enforceable?

&gt;* Should the state be able to force a woman to carry out ""specific performance"" of her contract if that requires her to give birth to an embryo she would like to abort, or to abort an embryo she would like to carry to term?

&gt;* What does motherhood mean?


&gt;


&gt;* What is the relationship between genetic motherhood, gestational motherhood, and social motherhood?

&gt;* Is it possible to socially or legally conceive of multiple modes of motherhood and/or the recognition of multiple mothers?

&gt;* Should a child born via surrogacy have the right to know the identity of any/all of the people involved in that child's conception and delivery?

The targeted sanctions are hitting many of his trusted inner circle who tend to live half their lives in the West anyway, whilst the more general ones (especially with Putin's help of imposing retaliatory sanctions) make the general publics life more difficult.

I won't name them, because I don't want to shame them I would just want to say to Putin: so what? They didn't and yet now they are; deal with it.

Also, consider that to try ""justify"" your country's existence to satisfy Putin's logic is pointless. Logic only serves Putin as a smoke screen for military bullying. You will never win an argument with him, because he treats his army as an actual rhetorical figure.

And we shouldn't follow his line of reasoning, because it is false while following it gives it credibility. The collapse of USSR is not a demarcation line for international borders, no one needs to prove anything to have a country.

I have an interesting thought for you to think upon though. We live in the most peaceful time the human race has ever seen, this is *partly* due to the unrivaled power that the US and her allies posess. Because of this perceived power, governments fear standing up to the US and even go out of their way to stay in her good books which keeps ""American interests"" safe. According to this idea, if the US starts to look weak hostile governments will start attacking the ""American interests"".

It's well documented in history that when any power is dominant over the entire world, periods of relative peace ensue, art and culture flourish and scientific knowledge improves at a exceptional rate. Also note that the last time an event of this calibre occurred (the ending of the Pax Britannica) we had two of the most devastating wars the world has ever seen. 

So before you deplore the war mongering nature of the US, recognise that it is their warmongering that gives them the perceived power which keeps us safe from aggression. ",0,1409520092,null,0,false,0,ck5pv0d,t3_2f2kwo,t1_ck5pv0d,t1_ck5dkwo,null,1427265041,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

All I am saying is that the biggest spender in NATO has the biggest voice in what its direction is going to be, what is only fair and is just something that happens. It does not happen all the time and it probably often does not happen by accident, but it's just how these things informally turn out to be, regardless of talk of equal partners.

Many NATO operations are not confined to defending alliance territory and have a more offensive nature. NATO makes us a lot stronger, but only if everyone agrees and we don't always agree with the Americans. At the moment we can't do a thing without the US; ergo we are not independent.

To me it seems NATO makes European politicians lazy, because they can rely on the US to bring the numbers as we could see in Libya when people ran out of ammunition alarmingly fast or in Mali when the French lacked transport. Without an US safety net by way of NATO, EU countries would have to create that capacity themselves.


In short, NATO slightly bends the policy of European countries towards that of the US (see Iran) and makes European politicians lazy; they can get away with budget cuts on defence.

[While low socio-economic status (SES) is generally accepted as a risk factor for violence, some have argued that intimate partner violence (IPV) is a ‘classless’ crime. We examine the effects of SES and prior criminal record on different types of police-reported violence committed in 2005–07 by Finnish men using a register-based general population sample that offers exceptionally good population coverage. While IPV against women appears somewhat less determined by offender’s low SES than other types of violent crime, we demonstrate considerable SES effects for all examined types of violence. Offenders in male-to-male violence in private settings appear the most marginalized.

as if he was sending a warning to Putin (""if we feel threatened, we'll leave"") but another way of hearing it is like ""we value our independence, so if we stay it means we feel no threat"". If I remember correctly, he also said (a while ago) that Ukraine signing a trade agreement with the EU would not be a threat to Kazakhstan's economy, so I don't know what the guy has in mind.

true,gschizas,GREE,Greece,"I don't know about Tyrol (how it relates to the rest of Austria), but Cyprus was indeed very isolated (by sea of course, not by mountains), and it has very different linguistic influences. It resembles ancient Greek a bit more than mainland Greek, and it has more Turkish and English influences than them.

Then again, there are quite a lot of areas in Greece that have developed under different influences. There were areas that were almost constantly under Turkish occupation, there were other areas that were under Italian occupation etc. The second least intelligible dialect is probably Cretan, although since Crete has been a part of the Greek state for much longer (Cyprus declared independence from UK in 1960, after being ""gifted"" to UK from Turkey in 1878, Crete was united with Greece in 1908/1913 after being declared semi-independent in 1898). The Ionian Islands (the islands closer to Italy, on the West) have definite Italian (Venetian) influences, and their accent is a lot more like singing. I could go on of course; I don't think there is any large area of Greece that doesn't have a very distinct accent. Sadly the differences are gradually disappearing (I'd say mostly because of TV), so this isn't as pronounced as it once was.

The first theatrical play that was written after the liberation from Ottoman rule was called ""Babylonia"", by Dimitrios Vyzantios (real name: Dimitrios Hadjiaslanis), which satirized exactly the mutual unintelligence between the Greek dialects. The main plot point (well, I'd say ""spoiler"", but you'd need to know Greek very well to understand the movie - due its nature it's virtually untranslatable) is the confusion that occurs because in Crete the word ""kouradia"" means ""sheep"", while in mainland Greece ""kourades"" means ""feces"".

It's like saying when a woman gets raped that she ""asked for it"" or ""had it coming"" because she dressed provocatively, or something.

It's sad and a shame that Croats didn't get the political representation they wanted in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and it's a shame and horrible that that (those?)

It might have been the ""trigger"" like with WW1 and the duke's assassination, but the cause? Just no.

The cause was that some of those Croats (Ustase) were completely insane murderous nutcases and let's leave it at that.

true,AccountHaver25,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; Commonly referred to as ""Gypsies"", the Romani, ethnically and genealogically disparate from other Europeans, began settling in America in the mid 19th century, fleeing centuries of persecution in Europe. Americans were and are largely unaware of the cultural and historical prejudices about Romani held by Europeans, and though American Romani are cautious about the stigma associated with their heritage,[2] they do not face discrimination or bigotry as they do in Europe. As a result, the social and economic position of Romani in the United States is substantively more favorable than in Europe, with many running successful family-owned businesses, and blending seamlessly into the community.[1]

The United States has the largest Romani population of any country in the world. It is very ignorant to say an entire ethnic group are all violent criminals, 2 to 12 million people. Especially since I just showed you an example of Romanies getting along with people without stigma. Yes there are bad Romanies but again there a lot of Romanies who aren't and saying all Romanies are bad is making things worse for everyone. Again, with less stigma Romanies can blend in easier. There are bad people of every ethnicity but they aren't resprentive. If it was a small group of ethnic Slovaks that terrorized that town would anybody notice their ethnicity?

Edit: What I'm saying is maybe we need to work on a society where people aren't judged as criminals for their ethnicity? The United States isn't perfect in that regard either especially with the stigma and discrimination against Americans of black African descent but other minority groups are discriminated here too.

You didn't even bother to read what I have written. I was talking about people starving in developed countries. Not developing. I know pretty well that African countries cannot export food to developed countries. Our farmers would lose this competition, that's for sure. Unfortunately we have to keep it this way for strategic reasons, a state cannot import all food from abroad.

true,FleshyDagger,ESTO,Estonia,"&gt; The United States has the largest Romani population of any country in the world.

Historic American Romani have nothing to do with the Romanian subculture that is infested with crime. For instance, what's the literacy rate among them? Is it 15%? Do they avoid paying taxes, leech on welfare, deny their children education and carry the tradition of blood feud? Is theft their main source of income? Does crime skyrocket wherever they go? Do they literally shit in the streets? The US does not have these people. You don't know what you are talking about.

In fact, gypsies are a privileged ethnicity. They are not expected to study, to work. They can marry children, sell drugs, pay no taxes and they still feel entitled to social support, which we hand out to them as a kind of bribe so they will at least try to behave. When police is called, they shoot back and our officers do not want to risk being arrested for shooting these *poor innocent people*. It's a lot easier to get into trouble with the government and police if you are a law-abiding citizen. *I* feel discriminated.

The only solution to this is to separate children from their abusive parents and give them proper education so that they can function in a modern society. But try to do that, and guess what - the racism card gets pulled! Oh no, once again they're getting oppressed.

Instead of writing me another naive reply, better go read the impressions of those who have first hand experience with gypsies as they are known in Europe: [one](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1f3bok/what_makes_europeans_hate_gypsies_so_much_are/ca6i463), [two](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1f3bok/what_makes_europeans_hate_gypsies_so_much_are/ca6i4yy), [three](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1f3bok/what_makes_europeans_hate_gypsies_so_much_are/ca6gmmx), [bonus round](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1f3bok/what_makes_europeans_hate_gypsies_so_much_are/ca6sy0o).",0,1409529393,null,0,1409529888,0,ck5tu65,t3_2f1xed,t1_ck5tu65,t1_ck5se25,null,1427263117,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
