Russians haven't been interested in that since the complete rape of their country in the 90s. You know what they call democracy? ""The rule of the people?""

Dermokratia. The rule of shit.

&gt;We could save money on our armed forces, so could they

Shit you don't really understand the Russian situation at all do you?

They have NATO bases, most of whom have been developing missile defences in breach of the ABMT (which GW Bush more or less decided to break with), on nearly every part of their borders. 

&gt;we're all past land grabs and sabre rattling and everyone wins.

The US hasn't been at all shy about threatening them, wether it was in showing it's willingness to shell a very neighbourly people like in Belgrade or the evidence that the Georgian situation with ethnic cleansing was given the go-ahead by the Americans. 

They've been perpetually dicked around by the US since the 90s, just an example would be the fact that they were promised no NATO bases east of Germany in exchange for allowing it's unification and entry into NATO and now their entire border is filled with them. 

This whole situation came about because the of the EU ultimatum which forced Ukraine, the South-eastern part of which is vital to Russia's security, to choose between Russia and the EU in a country largely split in half by preference to one or the other. Made all the more strange by Russia showing a willingness to work on a dual-western/russian basis in Ukraine up until then.

&gt;However in doing so they've united Europe against them

Most of Europe can't even agree on sanctions and the majority of powers who could supply them with the oil are dangerous to support in and of themselves. 

Merkel et al are still, rightly, looking for a peaceful solution to this crisis which the Americans are trying their best to sabotage in some crazed notion that they can afford to do so and that the Russians won't resort to dropping tactical nukes if it exacerbates into an existential crisis.

All current residents would get together in the common area on Sundays and hang out. The only reason we were able to communicate with each other was due to us all being able to speak English, though some more fluently than others.

No one should learn to speak Swedish, it's a waste of time. There's 10 million people that speaks Swedish, but nearly all of us also speak English fluently.

&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, many of their peers already were in the military in Iraq and Afghanistan, so expect a lot of desertion / no shows. And forcing people to serve will not be good for morale, at home or abroad, nor will it sit well at the home front.

As someone who sits in some of the most conservative parts of the US, I can tell you without any doubt that most Americans, especially many of the young people, think of Russia and the USSR as the same thing.  The fact that Putin is ex-KGB only reinforces such (however inaccurate) thoughts.  Now, as to the second point, in the US, being in the US military, regardless of the mission, regardless of the morality, is an honor and a privilege.  Sure, there are some dissenters - there always are and will be - but in a war with the *Red Menace* from Moscow, desertion will be minimal, like it was for the actions in Vietnam.  To many Americans, especially young Americans with little to no concept of history and world affairs, except that since they were four-years-old *their nation has been at war to preserve freedom*, to come home wrapped in a flag is to have died protecting American lives, liberty, freedom, and justice; it is a hero's death, steeped in eternal glory.

&gt; Yeah, the problem there is how will the rest of the world deal with this? Especially the Chinese. They may not like the Russians, but the last thing they want is a fully mobilized US either. 

What are they going to do?  Mobilize their military?  The one with no way to attack on a large scale that, while large, really is no more than a regional power, because of the defensive nature and posture they have preserved and maintained for decades?  It would be a challenge to be sure, but only in scope, not quality.  Economically?  The $1.5T of US assets they own is an order of magnitude less than America's annual GDP.  Let them call the debt in and watch the US tell them to piss off.  As that loss of cash cripples their economy and causes only minor damage to the US 'credit status', they'll back off.  If the US is at war with Russia, Europe will be, too and they'll keep taking financial 'risk' in the US, because, after all, who else can they get to wield a military that size to protect them that they don't have to pay for?

&gt; Let's presume the US goes all in and images of shot down B-52s, B-2 and the smoldering wreck of a carrier show up.... what will happen then?

More volunteers.  Allow me, if you will, to quote General George S Patton of the American 3rd Army in WWII to explain the American mentality (regardless of accuracy) on the topic, ""*All real Americans love the sting and clash of battle. When you were kids, you all admired the champion marble shooter, the fastest runner, the big-league ball players and the toughest boxers. Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time. That's why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war. The very thought of losing is hateful to Americans. Battle is the most significant competition in which a man can indulge. It brings out all that is best and it removes all that is base.*""

&gt; The fear of a falling empire. Just ask the British on how they went about it.

Indeed.

If the US is really at this point then I guess we'll see the end of the Empire sooner than expected. My bet was more on a war with China over Taiwan, but I guess an old enemy does just as well.

They could simply stop shipping goods to the US, considering JIT the US would have how many weeks before the consumer at home would feel the pain?

Like it or not, they are still the workshop of the world and there would be no way that the US could build up the necessary manufacturing in short order. 

So they do have some leverage and apparently they also have a nice new aircraft carrier killer out there. I am sure they wouldn't mind Russia testing it for them.

See this I am not so sure about. Many people, you too, draw parallels to WWII, but that was a different time, the country was more blue collar and many people still had strong relations back to Europe. Much of that is no longer the case in today's world.

Then there is the question on America's self-image. Politicians don't seem to think the photos of casualties are real sellers these days either. Think ""Black Hawk Down"" which has the US basically run and avoid anything for a few years. Or the Bush administration blocking the photos of the returning coffins.

true,katarn86,ESPA,EU,"&gt; Personally I would say the best defense against nukes isn't more nukes.

Tell that to Ukraine and their Budapest Memorandum.

&gt; but a defense shield. The US and EU caved to Russian pressure though. 

A defence shield is against the ABM treaty and against MAD, also, the US tried to sell the project as only a defence against Iran, not against Russia (and it makes sense, as any of the GMDs are more expensive than the mirvs they'll have to destroy, also,[ they don't really work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-Based_Midcourse_Defense)),

&gt; I am not sure it was 100% of a bluff. The energy situation in the US has made it less important to keep energy routes in North Africa and the Middle East safe.

The US has always seen the Middle East as their area of influence, not because a direct need of energy but due to their relationships with Saudi Arabia, Israel and Egypt (due to money, religion and Suez respectively). Those relations haven't changed, and neither has US policy (as seen recently in their answer to the Arab Spring in Libya, Egypt, Bahrain, Tunisia and Yemen).

&gt; This is increasingly a European issue, and given how high income Europe is, I am not sure the US will continue to foot the bill for this security indefinitely.

There's this theory often repeated about US footing the bill for EU defence, but really, right now most US operations in EU are transport and refuelling ones (we are a pit stop between US and ME). The exceptions are RAF Lakenheart (due to their relationship with UK), Aviano, in Italy (due to Yugoslavian wars), Spangdahlem, in Germany, with a whole 1 squadron of F-16, and the Baltic NATO air police (that isn't an USAF mission but a NATO one, with contributions from all members).

For completion, the US Army keeps less than 20,000 soldiers in EU (so a force similar to the Portuguese Army, and right now without MBT support), the Navy keeps (afaik) 4 ddg destroyers and the Marines keep some minor units (some SOF, Embassy security...)

So really, I don't see how the US is footing the bill (you did in the past, both through troops and through cheap sales to allies, and certainly you do in international ops, but you no longer do it  in Europe, mostly because Russia's conventional forces suck so much that the current conventional forces of EU countries would be more than enough to counter them).

&gt; Especially given increasing pressure from US allies to increase presence in Asia. ASEAN nations even have asked for the US to do so, knowing full well they share borders with China and threaten to anger China by doing so. That doesn't include very strong traditional US allies like SK and Japan that would like to see more US presence.

true,PabloSpicyWeiner,GERM,★★★★ Weltmeister ★★★★,"To answer your question let me first explain what exactly the problem is we have with the US. I think there is a simple cultural difference with the term ""friend"" between the US and Germany (and almost all other nations in Europe, really) that I found myself when I was living in the US. So it's neither your fault nor ours.

**Disclaimer: This is my own experience, so don't downvote if you disagree.**

What could be considered a ""friend"" in the US: Could be pretty much everyone you meet frequently. It could be the waitress in you favourite restaurant or your hairdresser or the guy that takes your dogs for a walk. There is no other social interaction necessary to say he or she is your ""friend"". 

What could be considered a ""friend"" in Germany: Someone you can rely on, someone you can share your intimate thoughts with. Someone who knows your weaknesses and you trust him not to use it against you. All others are just someone you know.

So the big difference is the amount of trust you give those people you call friends.

We had this trust towards the US, and it was shattered. Even worse, it doesn't look like the US feels like they did something wrong. Casually rummaging your nightstand drawer.....*#justnsathings*

Maybe people are right to say ""agencies are spying on each other....d'oh"", we just didn't expect this. Call us naive but we considered the US a ""friend"".

So to answer your question: We will reconsider our relationship thoroughly and adapt to this new situation. We will take appropriate measures so these things will not happen again. Although we will still see you as an ally, we will make sure to not confuse the US term ""friend"" (Obama really likes to use it excessively) with a real friendship in the German sense anymore, because, well, we really aren't.",0,1399191015,null,0,1399273943,0,ch94mzt,t3_24iyyr,t1_ch94mzt,t1_ch867a6,null,1433643456,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Its a bit like 'whatever feels natural'.

Also, we have a neutral gender too that works for those words that you're not sure of. 'Floppy' is a good example, I think. I guess people couldn't decide on its gender so it became neutral. :)

I think it's only then that organizations responsible in maintaining the official language get to actually do something - they wait until a word becomes common and just take whatever gender most people use and just make it official...

EDIT: also - languages seem to use typical suffixes, and these often 'carry' the gender.

&gt;

&gt;__Football [hooliganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooliganism)__ refers to unruly, violent, and destructive behaviour by overzealous supporters of [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) clubs, including brawling, vandalism and intimidation. 

&gt;Football hooliganism normally involves conflict between gangs, often known as football [firms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hooligan_firms) (the term derives from the British slang for a criminal gang), formed for the specific purpose of intimidating and physically attacking supporters of other teams. Certain clubs have long-standing rivalries with other clubs (usually, but not always, geographically close) and hooliganism associated with matches between them (sometimes called [local derbies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_derby)), is likely to be more severe.

&gt;Conflict may take place before, during or after matches. Participants often select locations away from [stadia](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stadia) to avoid arrest by the police, but conflict can also erupt spontaneously inside the stadium or in the surrounding streets. In such cases, shop windows may be smashed, rubbish bins set on fire,   and police cars may be overturned. In extreme cases, hooligans, police, and bystanders have been killed, and body-armoured [riot police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_police) have intervened with [tear gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas), [police dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dogs), [armoured vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_fighting_vehicle) and [water cannons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cannon).

Now people speak English quite well, both in Sweden and Denmark, but it is *nowhere* near native fluency. Not even close. Highly educated people may struggle with both pronunciation and vocabulary, even if they still manage to get their point across with some precision.

Yeah, thats called fall of an empire that was held together with tanks and oppression. What did Russia expect, a handout on silver platter and a soft cushion?

The problem with Russia is that its sh'tting in its own bath and its comfortable in it. Instead of changing the water it keeps living in the same old sh't. World is changing and moving forward while Russia keeps looking back at fairy tales of the past.

&gt;They've been perpetually dicked around by the US since the 90s, just an example would be the fact that they were promised no NATO bases east of Germany in exchange for allowing it's unification and entry into NATO and now their entire border is filled with them.

That's because Eastern Europe was very eager to join Nato (tanks to Soviet Union). They are a sovereign countries after all. And by the way. Promises that are not on the paper are not very good for argument my friend. 

&gt;This whole situation came about because the of the EU ultimatum which forced Ukraine, the South-eastern part of which is vital to Russia's security

Ukraine is Ukraine, not Russia. And EU has been very friendly towards Russia since the 90's. Even now you can see how they want to please Russia. It's just EU has very different understanding of 21st century. It is not thinking of terms of ""whoa, we need a buffer, because we are potentially going to war with Russia"". EU has no issues with countries like Switzerland and Norway etc (including Russia) being next to them. Because EU is bunch of pacifist who wants business relations with its neighbors. But Russia seems to live in the past, play the good old iron curtain game. 

Looking back, I can tell that both misinterpreted each other. Russia did not understand EU, that it just wanted to be business partners, and EU did not understand Russia, that its still in cold war mode. 

Edit: looking for a way to hide bad words:)

 I study in Bonn. If you are studying at Uni Bonn, it's good to know that there is no actual campus. The university has buildings all over the city. When you arrive, I would recommend taking the time to familiarise yourself with the university.

Do visit Cologne and also check out Drachenfels, which is south of Bonn along the Rhine. The views are wonderful and there's a castle.

Don't try crossing crosswalks when the don't walk sign is still lit. You will get death stares or possibly yelled at from old people and mothers.

Don't try to do small talk with strangers or anyone you are doing 'business' with (that includes cashiers and the like). Germans are not fond of this.

But don't be afraid to ask for help. Germans are really nice and helpful. 

Be prepared when at the checkout after buying groceries. Have a bag and method of payment ready and be prepared to pack your stuff quickly. Germans are very efficient at grocery shopping.

Respect the bike lanes. Do not walk on the bike paths.

There are great places for students to find cheap meals other than the Mensa (cafeteria), which is cheap, but the food is awful, imo.
Currywurst and doner are popular and worth trying. If you happen to be near Meckhenheimer allee by the Poppelsdorfer Schloss, check out the Tibetan (for awesome noodles!) or Indian imbiss (Ok Indian- a nice break from typically German fare). If you like meat, stop by the butcher for lunch. There is a plethora of different types of places to eat, so don't just stick to the Mensa!

Do not order an Altbier, especially in Cologne. 

Don't assume you can pay by credit or debit. Many smaller shops only accept cash.

Check out some of the museums in Bonn. There are a ton (art, science &amp; nature, calculators . . .), and depending on what you are interested in, you can find something.

Have fun :)

Asked what’s motivating them, they invariably turn to stock phrases that have been widely propagated on Russian state television: “Kiev junta,” “fascists,” “illegitimate government,” “referendum,” “federalization.” Follow-up questions rarely yield any enlightening answers.

So the question is. Is Kiev run by fascists, like so many pro-Russians in Reddit and in Russian media claim? In what way fascism is manifesting itself in Ukraine(is it on paper or the actions) ?

*my own understanding so far: Because I haven't yet seen any fascist political decisions coming from Kiev(perhaps western media has been omitting the issue). Here in Reddit I heard few times about making Russian language illegal, but it sounds ridiculous and unrealistic. I know there are few Right Sector guys on top places. But isn't it universal? Isn't ""ultra-nationalists"" represented pretty much in every country's government(including Russia - Dugin, Zhirinovsky)?*

Sono solo i tifosi del Napoli che, se provocati, reagiscono in maniera altrettanto elegante? Cosa fanno gli interisti, i milanisti, e tutti gli altri? Non giustifico nessuno, dico soltanto che il fatto di essere tifosi del Napoli (o magari essere di Napoli) non aggiunge e non toglie niente a quello che è successo ieri: spara ad un tifoso della Juve, offendilo per tutta la partita, e vedi cosa ti succede.

Il problema è che nella mente degli autoproclamati leghisti come te, tutto questo non ha nessuna importanza. Questo è solo un altro pretesto per additare Napoli ed i Napoletani, mentre la responsabilità secondo me è della primitiva mentalità ultras, indipendente dalla provenienza e dai colori.

There are some people (probably most people on /r/europe) that I can have a normal conversation with in English with without worrying about their comprehension because there's no need to. 

Then there are other people who you have to speak ""basic English"" with. These people have a roughly intermediate level of English. They can have basic conversations if you speak clearly and are careful about how quickly you speak. The people who speak basic English aren't lesser people in any way, they usually just come from different circumstances - from a country that uses a language that is very different from English (eg the far east), or they had a less rigorous Education in English growing up, or they haven't had the chance to learn from native speakers or English is their third rather than their second language. 

Whenever I speak to a stranger who speaks English as a second language, I start out speaking basic English and adjust to their level of fluency as the conversation progresses.

^^^With ^^^the ^^^4-day ^^^weekend ^^^of ^^^May ^^^1, ^^^not ^^^much ^^^happened.

---
*Politics*

* The results of the elections were finally confirmed by the National Election Office. The only notable thing about it is that 11 Fidesz MPs also hold government appointed positions, which is a banned conflict of interest. Until lawmakers decide on the flow of things, Fidesz may not have their supermajority in the first days of the Assembly's session next week. They convene on Tuesday.

* May 1 was the [10-year anniversary of the biggest enlargement of the EU](http://www.politics.hu/20140428/ten-states-joining-in-2004-turning-point-for-eu-officials-say-at-tenth-anniversary-conference/). As such analysts looked back at our decade with mixed, but mostly [positive judgments](http://www.politics.hu/20140429/hungary-benefits-from-ten-years-of-eu-membership-says-ec-representative/). Naturally Fidesz with their semi-anti-Brussels policies [had to give the topic a shove](http://www.politics.hu/20140501/enforcing-national-interests-in-eu-important-task-says-fidesz-mep/), but nothing major. On an average, each citizen of ours received net 1800€ in EU funds over the years, the biggest contributor is Germany with about 350€. 

* May 1 was also the date of our new land law coming into force after the expiration of the EU-exemption of land ownership. [Euro-sceptic Jobbik](http://www.politics.hu/20140501/jobbik-leader-calls-for-mobilizing-against-land-law/) and [green LMP](http://www.politics.hu/20140429/fidesz-sees-no-reason-to-amend-land-law/) were both crying treason over the case of EU-national foreigners now being able to buy land under very limited circumstances in Hungary. [Fidesz is also buying up lands to keep them in Hungarian hands.](http://www.politics.hu/20140429/govt-ramps-up-buys-of-arable-land/) 

* A judge refused to dissolve a paramilitary nationalist group that marched through Roma ghettos as a display of power. [In reading the verdict, she used anti-Roma statements to the uproar of civil groups](http://www.politics.hu/20140430/judge-makes-anti-roma-statements-refuses-to-dissolve-far-right-paramilitary-group/). It's strange to hear such words from judges as they always shy away from the slightest hints of taking sides in matters like this. 

* [Freedom House released their global study on freedom of media, ruling Hungary partly free and as the 71st country globally in these terms.](http://www.politics.hu/20140501/freedom-house-ranks-hungary-media-as-partly-free/) We've been roughly in this position since Fidesz came into power, before that we ranked much better. 

* [The Council of Europe released their findings on the state of Hungarian prisons, which as you can guess is pretty abysmal.](http://www.politics.hu/20140430/coe-report-documents-abuse-at-hungarian-prisons/) Overcrowding and physical abuse against the inmates were the main concerns. 

* Socialist party leader [Attila Mesterházy was re-elected](http://www.politics.hu/20140501/mesterhazy-re-elected-socialist-party-group-leader/) and also some minor [EP-election stuff](http://www.politics.hu/20140429/fidesz-to-start-ep-campaign-tour-on-monday/) happened that noone really cares about. 

* In case you're bored of my leftist rants, [here's a guest piece on Al-Jazeera](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/04/understanding-choice-hungarian-2014418153246906272.html) by a Fidesz deputy state secretary, written in the very specific tone of knowing-it-all that Fidesz loves to use a lot.

*Economy*

* [The European Court of Justice ruled that it is in the power of the Hungarian Supreme Court to rule in the unfair FX-loan cases](http://www.politics.hu/20140428/luxembourg-rules-decision-on-fx-loan-is-up-to-hungarian-court/). This relates to a single private individual's suit, who's also making a nice living out of it, by running a party entirely focused around the rights of FX-loan ""victims"". They ran in the elections as well with no success. 

---
*Misc.*

* Big storms yesterday in some parts of the country, trees fell. 

* The high school matriculation exams start on Monday, most high schools held their graduation ceremonies on Thursday. 

* Regulations for significantly reducing the salt, sugar and fat contents for public meals were revised and will be effective from September 1. Hungarians did what they do best, they bitched ""MUHH SALT, MUHH FLAVAHS, MUHH FREEHDUMS"" and swore they'll send salt shakers with their kids to save them from the nightmare of low-sodium meals. 

* The biggest news of the week is probably the Women's Handball Champions' League Final Four being held in Budapest this weekend. Our team, Győri ETO is the firm favorite as they are the title defendants. Yesterday they beat Denmark's Midtjylland to meet with Montenegrin Buducnost in the final later today. 

* [Orbán opened yet another stadium](http://www.politics.hu/20140502/orban-opens-stadium-in-debrecen-costing-govt-huf-12-5-billion/), this time in Debrecen that was built for 40m€. Debreceni VSC is at least one of the more successful Hungarian football teams by our standards (which is not very successful). 

* Hungarian pilgrims visited Auschwitz as part of the international March of living. By train. That was exclusively reserved for them.

true,boq,BAVA,near Germany,"&gt; It especially pisses me off, when guys like CGP Grey (/u/MindOfMetalAndWheels) advocate to stop teaching/learning foreign languages for English speaking countries. - This means everyone else still has to learn English to some degree...

This annoys me too, but not for your reason. It deprives native English speakers of a lot of things. There just are experiences that you can't have with English only. You'll never get a real understanding of the hierarchies in Japanes society, for example, if you don't try to learn their language a bit. Cultures and languages are intertwined to a certain degree, and the self-imposed language barrier is a detriment to them, not us.

I'm always reminded of a way of thinking a friend introduced me to, which he called the four phases of enlightenment (turns out it's based on [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence)).

1. Unconscious incompetence: You've never driven a car and can't even imagine what could be hard about driving one.
2. Conscious incompetence: You're in the car, first driving lesson, you can't even move 5m without trouble. Turns out there are challenges!
3. Conscious competence: You've been driving a few times and can now do it if you concentrate. But become inattentive, and you're back at 2.
4. Unconscious competence: After 10 years the car has become an extension of your body. You fly over the Autobahn as if you had been born there.

Unfortunately, phases 1 and 4 can be hard to discern: you might think there is no challenge in steering a car because you can do it half asleep or because you have no idea about the potential challenges. Thus, many people at 1 think they are at 4, harming themselves and others.

I sincerely believe many people who advocate not learning a foreign language are stuck around 1, thinking they are at 4.

&gt; ‘During the national commemoration of Remembrance Day we remember all those – civilians and soldiers – who have been killed or murdered in the Kingdom of the Netherlands or anywhere else in the world in war situations or during peace-keeping operations since the outbreak of the Second World War.’ (Memorandum 2010)

During the last county elections a new trend emerged: taking a selfie while voting, the so called ""stemfie"". While it is allowed, it has lead to some criticism on whether or not allowing this is a good thing, as it could aid in people buying/selling votes. A court has been asked to rule on this.

He is out on very strict conditions and will be closely watched and protected due to numerous death threats.

In the past 20 years, people going to church or taking part in a 'religious ceremony' has dropped to an all time low. (Down by 71%) - Suprisingly: younger generations are far more strict in their beliefs than older ones. 

edit: More strict in their beliefs meaning more extreme, fundamentalist.

It's obligatory for certain sorts of non-positive sentences in English, which confuses the hell out of the Germans, who perpetrate sentences like:

*""Very seldom we do get examples right first time.""

I think the best way of looking at this is that the verb-second arrangement of German used to be much more common (or even the default) in English, but was replaced in almost all common cases, and is now the *exception*, but still obligatory in some circumstances.

I'm not bitter about any of those two. Learning new languages opens your mind and your view to a lot of new things.

Anyone who complains about languages needs to take a look at tonal languages. They are fucking insane.  

Language is a huge part of one's culture, but also a tool for communication and understanding. So i feel both your native language and your ""communication"" language (if they are not the same) are equally important. You should pay attention to both.

**Politics**

[Ed Miliband Proposes to Renationalise the Railways](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/03/rail-state-control-ed-miliband), this is more a grab for attention than anything else in my opinion, the contracts are up for renewal in the next few years, and instead of giving them to private companies Miliband proposes to keep them in the governments hands, hasn't said much about decreasing any rail fares etc so I can't see much good happening.

[Possiblity for a debate between UKIP leader Nigel Farage and PM David Cameron](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27274622) - Similar to Farage's debate with Clegg a month or so ago, where Farage came out on top in most people's estimates. It'd be interesting to see how Farage comes out against what most people think will be his biggest rival in 2015. (The Conservative Party)

[Yougov polls suggest the Scottish referendum is getting closer](http://www.channel4.com/news/scotland-independence-85-per-cent-no-vote-poll-exclusive), 58% No, 42% Yes. Last time I can remember the No campaign was in the mid 60s, so it's looking much better for the Yes campaign, on that note the Sunday Herald has also joined the Yes cause [Link](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-27274460)

**General News**

[Max Clifford, Jailed for 8 years](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27259318) He was found guilty of sexual assaults and given an eight year sentence, although many think it's extremely light seeing as there were allegations against him assaulting a 12 year old.

[Prince Harry and his girlfriend, Cressida Bonas split up](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27219684) Not much to say, but if you're into the Royals there you go.

[Jeremy Clarkson receives a ""final warning"" on the BBC after saying ""Nigger"" on a piece of unaired footage](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/03/jeremy-clarkson-given-final-warning-by-the-bbc) Pretty ridiculous if you ask me, he's one of their most valuable assets, this is even more ridiculous than the Jonathon Ross affair.

**Economics**

[Pfizer takeover of Astrazeneca is being questioned by Miliband, he wonders if it's in Britain's 'national interest'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27274954) Also important is that this would be the largest takeover by a foreign company in Britain, the bid at the moment sits at £63bn ($106.3bn / €76.62bn)

[Energy Crisis as thousands could be cutoff for up to three months](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/may/03/energy-cutoffs), this is despite continuous promises that there'd be no cutoffs.

**Sports**

[Top 4 Champions League Places were confirmed after Everton lost to Man City 3-2 this weekend](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27168536) (Man City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal to go through) Man City's win also puts them one step closer to the title

[Fulham are relegated after 13 straight seasons in the Premier League](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27168529) Cardiff are also out, with Norwich looking the least likely to stay up.

red and black might be common with nazis but they are also common in, say, angola where they make the national flag.
as for this particular flag it goes back to the flag of the Ukrainian nationalists from early XX century, not the nazis.
to sum it up, you have suspisions based on circumstantial evidence like the colours that one of the ruling parties might be neo-nazi, but still insist that there's strong fascist influence for the government.
i would still prefer to judge sonebody a fascist or a nazi by something concrete in what they say or do. i personally heard loads of svovoda speeches and i see them in action both in the parliament and in tge streets. yes, they are nationalistic to some extent, although nothing compared to many european parties like national front of france. it's more like sinn fein in ireland (btw, svoboda is indeed very leftish in their approaches)",0,1399206310,null,0,1399207316,0,ch96z2o,t3_24ok5w,t1_ch96z2o,t1_ch96ony,null,1433644556,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

 Fine Gael and Labour have been in government for the last 3 years, have introduced 3 austerity budgets in a row and are seen by many as continuing the policies of Fianna Fáil, who we were all so happy to get rid of three years ago. 

Meanwhile Sinn Fein are the only large party in the Dáil who are explicitly anti-austerity and the only ones offering a real alternative to the conservative reactionary politics that we have in Ireland today.

 Sinn Fein also got many new followers from the Labour party who are now very unpopular, as they had a traditionally left leaning support base, many of whom became disillusioned by their term in government.

true,lonuas,Zpaysdegalle,Pays De Galle,"Etant enfant d'immigrés (et étant considérée comme immigrée jusqu'à mes 16 ans et des poussières par l'Etat), je peux t'apporter un point de vue sur ça, même si je précise que j'ai surtout vécu et grandi dans des quartiers où la majorité était/est franco-française.

Est-ce que les enfants d'immigrés sont ségrégués? Oui et non. Ca dépend de beaucoup de facteurs: est-ce que la langue maternelle est le français? Est-ce que les parents des autres enfants ont des préjugés envers les étrangers? Est-ce que le quartier est culturellement divers? Est-ce que l'enseignant à des préjugés envers les étrangers? Je suis personnellement entrée en maternelle en parlant peu le français, j'ai peu de souvenir de la maternelle mais je ne me souviens pas avoir eu des copains/copines, juste des personnes dans ma classe avec qui je jouais de temps à autre parce qu'il fallait faire une activité de groupe. En primaire, ça se passait déjà beaucoup mieux. Mais dans tout les cas, il y aura toujours quelqu'un pour te faire sentir que tu es différent, que tu ne fais pas partie de l'ensemble mais de là à dire qu'il y a une ségrégation, je n'irais pas jusque là.

Mon avantage, par rapport aux autres enfants qui ont dans des quartiers où la présence de diverses cultures est beaucoup plus forte, c'est que la majorité dans la classe a toujours été française et que les profs ne peuvent pas vraiment se dire ""bon eux, on va les laisser tomber"". La majorité française avance, la minorité se débrouille pour garder le niveau et c'est une mentalité très différente dans d'autres quartiers où les profs abandonnent très rapidement parce que les élèves n'ont pas la pression de groupe pour s'améliorer et s'imposer une discipline.

De plus, dans les quartiers où la majorité est française, il y a une espèce d'attente au tournant de la part des adultes. Si il y a que 5 familles maghrébines dans le quartier, ça va être facile pour les autres adultes de leur dire directement à la sortie des classes ""Ah j'ai entendu que votre enfant..."". En réaction à cela, les parents vont alors punir leur enfant parce qu'ils savent bien que si ça perdure, ça va finir par retomber sur eux (et que les parents, dans tout les cas, veulent que leurs enfants s'en sortent et améliorent leur situation). Dans les cités ou les ZEPs, ça sera déjà beaucoup difficile de placer le blâme quand les chamailleries en classe est un effet de groupe et non d'un ou deux élèves.

Est-ce que c'est la faute des parents? Des profs? Des élèves? Je dirais que c'est un mélange de tout. D'un côté, on aura toujours l'impression qu'on est pas les bienvenus en France même si c'est le pays qu'on aura connu pendant toute notre vie et qu'on nous blâme pour des choses dont on est pas responsable. Alors ça nous donne pas envie de faire quelque chose, à quoi bon si à la fin les employeurs choisiront toujours des français ""purs"" par rapport à nous, de l'immigration? D'un autre côté, ça peut donner la force et le courage de se dire ""bah, je le leur montrerais, moi"" et de passer au dessus de tout ça. Mais c'est quelque chose de beaucoup plus difficile à faire quand tu viens d'une cité et que ton grand frère ne trouve pas de boulot, que tes potes se font plus de thunes en étant dealers, que tu sais que les profs t'ont collés l'étiquette de raté alors que l'année vient de commencer. Ces personnes là vivent dans des milieux clôt qui sont une forme de cercle vicieux, et une fois qu'ils grandissent, on ne peut plus leur dire ""Non ça, ça se dit pas"" puisqu'ils t'en veulent tellement qu'ils pensent avant tout que c'est une remarque raciste sur les valeurs qu'ils ont appris.

Bref, ceux qui s'en sortent sont des gens qui sont forcément super travailleurs, parce qu'ils savent qu'ils doivent lutter ""contre le courant"". Ceux qui sont bloqués en bas le sont pour un mélange compliqué de raisons qui fait que la solution ne sera jamais juste de dire que ""c'est la faute de l'éducation nationale"" ou ""c'est la faute de leurs parents qui ne les élèvent pas"".

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"Let me give a crash course on Irish politics, just for people who don't get how fucked it really is;

Our politics is mostly dominated by Centre-Right Fine Gael and populist Fianna Fáil.

Fianna Fáil is a populist Civil War party who style themselves as ""The Republican Party""(Despite that it was Fine Gael who declared the Republic, but I digress). They're the guys who drove Ireland into the ground and they have an extensive history of corrupt politics. One of the hot-button issues in Irish politics right now is actually the introduction of Water Meters, meaning we have to pay for water usage, which is something the extremely corrupt FF Taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, got rid of.

Fine Gael is the more conservative branch of Irish politics. They're for traditional things like family values etc. but they're also the guys who agreed to put a referendum on abortion, albeit under public pressure. 

On a related note, abortion is illegal in Ireland unless the mother's life is at risk, this is as a result of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, which was passed via the aforementioned referendum and signed into law by President Higgins, a much more liberal activist(We love him here). 

Anyhow, Fine Gael is another Civil War relic and have traditionally encouraged good relations with the United Kingdom and peaceful resolutions to the conflict in the North, where the Fianna Fáil government was combative and supplied arms to the IRA in the North, and even mobilized our military at one stage in the 60's when things started to get out of hand in a border county.

Labour is really nothing and you might as well forget about them in regards to next election. But in the interest of balance, Labour is supposed to be the centre-left alternative to left wing parties such as Sinn Féin, and has successfully being do so quite well. However, I expect their next election to be their downfall, as they are currently minority partners in a coalition government with Fine Gael, which mean there was huge compromise on their policies and their supporters are disillusioned. 

Sinn Féin, like Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, is a relic of Ireland's war years, the difference being that it's made an attempt to actually evolve with the political landscape. They're looking like they're going to do very well in the next elections, but not out of their own skill, more out of the sheer incompetence of the current ""Big 3"" - Labour/FG/FF

Sinn Féin classes itself as Socialist, and is 32-County Republican, but the Socialist part is debatable, despite the fact their past is historically rooted in the Radical Left(i.e. Communism). They're pretty much centre-left Social Democrat nowadays.

The difference between Ireland and most other democracies, is that opposed to the Left-Right divide, we still - unfortunately - run on outdated Civil War politics, which is why Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil(Who were on opposite sides) are still the big boys on the block, where Labour and other parties like Labour have problems breaking into government.      

It's different with Sinn Féin, they're theoretically older than any other party in Ireland, but due to their militant past, many in the Republic have previously found it hard to vote for them - in contrast to the North where they power-share after the Troubles. 

Sinn Féin, due to being around so long but having been out of Southern government for the best part of a century, is starting to see a surge in popularity as a legitimate alternative, especially due to the Peace Process and what appears to be a stable Northern Ireland giving them legitimacy as a political party in its own right as opposed to simply being the Political Wing of the IRA. The arrest of Gerry Adams, and if he's found culpable, will have a dramatic effect on this, which is why it's such a big deal, not only for the political landscape of the North and the jeopardy it puts the peace process in, but it will change the current direction of the Republic's politics - i.e. the decline of the Civil War parties. 

Other than those 4(FF/FG/LB/SF), there's the disunited Left i.e. Socialist Party, People Before Profit, Worker's Action Group - and, ironically, a party called the United Left - all who are essentially non-entities in national politics, except when they make fools of themselves(Which for me is rather annoying).

In short, Irish politics is a shambles dominated by a form of politics that no longer matters. This has led to the resurgence of Sinn Féin as a real alternative for the first time in decades.

Should Sinn Féin do well enough in the next national elections, this could signal a radical shift in how Irish politics is practiced and signal a rise in the Left for the first time ***ever***. Which is why I will be voting for them.",0,1399209004,null,0,false,0,ch97icl,t3_24ohl5,t1_ch97icl,t3_24ohl5,null,1433644808,22,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,22

Linguistically, Danish is far more progressive than any of the other Nordic languages, with Icelandic being on the opposite end of the scale and almost never borrowing words (which is why ""electricity"" is called ""amber power"" in Icelandic through a translation of the Greek root 'elektr-').

Norwegians may well make some of the same mistakes as Swedes, although Norwegian is generally also quite flexible, due to having many prolific dialects and a liberal attitude toward loan words in pronunciation (though not spelling — hence ""juice"" is ""djus"").

One simple way to distinguish Danish from both Swedish and Norwegian (both the native language and the accent in English) is the complete lack of tonal intonation.

The quality is somewhat criticized as some say that it was made for children younger than 1st graders, or that the content is not very interesting and might fail to encourage children to get engaged in lessons.

* Labour Day celebrations were extra-symbolic this year as all trade unions, from south and north (except right-wing SEK) decided to hold a common protest in the demilitarisation zone of Nicosia, for the first time in 56 years (before even Independence in 1960). Greek and Turkish Cypriots reaffirmed the urgent need for  a common struggle against Troika-imposed austerity in the south, and Ankara-imposed austerity in the north, and renewed their dedication to the reunification of Cyprus. While the trade union rhetoric was centred around the two main ethnic groups, Cyprus' Armenian and Kurdish population were also boldly participating, and feminist/queer/ant-authoritarian blocs were visible. The events in Nicosia, and all other districts were peaceful, but  Yeni Kıbrıs Partisi reported that northern Cyprus' border police arbitrarily delayed issuing exit visas to some protesters marching with YKP, keeping them at the checkpoint for more than 2 hours. Analyists said that the political importance of that celebration is evident in how mainstream media didn't cover it, and compare it to a significantly smaller but politician-organised Christian mass in a church in the Turkish north that was even transmitted live from two television channels [[Reddit/Imgur]](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/24hkyi/after_56_years_turkish_and_greek_cypriots_reunite/) [[Ag/Photos]](http://agkarra.com/%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE-%CF%80%CF%81%CF%89%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%AC-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%AE-%CE%B6%CF%8E%CE%BD%CE%B7-%CF%86/) [[Video]](http://youtu.be/ZlsXTzZ7l38) People continue to be upset about having to show their passport to go from one neighbour to another in their city, so on the occasion of Labour Day, they filmed [this video](http://vimeo.com/93642759)

Fun fact:

The city of Odessa, which was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1792 was founded by [Moldovans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa#In_the_Russian_Empire):

&gt;However, adjacent to the new [Odessa] official locality, a Moldavian colony already existed, which by the end of 18th century was an independent settlement known under the name of Moldavanka. 

&gt;Some local historians consider that the settlement predates Odessa by about thirty years and assert that the locality was founded by Moldavians who came to build the fortress of Yeni Dunia for the Ottomans and eventually settled in the area in the late 1760s, right next to the settlement of Khadjibey (since 1795 Odessa proper), on what later became the Primorsky Boulevard. Another version posits that the settlement appeared after Odessa itself was founded, as a settlement of Moldavians, Greeks and Albanians fleeing the Ottoman yoke.[4]

Darum geht es doch nicht. Privat kann man auf jeder Anrede und Bezeichnung bestehen, wir reden hier aber vom Gesetz und welche Wirkungen es aufgrund welcher Tatbestandsvoraussetzungen zeitigt. Hier geht es also um Rechtssicherheit.

&gt; Ich bin einfach der Meinung, dass das biologische Geschlecht nicht viel mehr ""ist"" als dein von deinen Eltern verpasster Name.

Der Meinung kann man natuerlich sein. Aber, wie gesagt, das Gesetz unterscheidet anscheinend zwischen biologischem und rechtlichem Geschlecht. Und immer dann, wenn es das tut, besteht Potential fuer Konflikte, die so grundsaetzlich sind, dass es dem parlamentarischen Gesetzgeber vorbehalten sein muss, hier eine andersartige Regelung zu treffen.

Kleines Beispiel: Das Gesetz erlaubt nur die Feststellung der Vaterschaft, nicht aber der Mutterschaft. Waere eine F2M-Transgenderperson noch waehrend der Geburt mit ihrem Mann verheiratet, obwohl das Kind von einem anderen Mann ist, dann waere der Ehemann der Vater. Dagegen koennte der eigentliche Vater zwar vorgehen, indem er seine Vaterschaft feststellen laesst, was aber nur dann geht, wenn die F2M-Transgenderperson nicht selbst als Vater eingetragen ist. 

Umgekehrt, also wenn eine F2M-Transgenderperson in der Ehe mit einer Frau ein Kind gebaehrt und sich zum Vater erklaeren lassen koennte, muesste man dann diskutieren, ob man die Mutterschaft auch fingieren lassen kann (analoge Anwendung des Vaterschaftsfeststellungsparagraphen), womit im Erfolgsfall dann das Tor offen waere fuer Leihmutterschaft, die auch verfassungsrechtlichen Gruenden verboten ist.

Wer kein Mitleid mit dem Erzeuger hat, ein kleiner Fall aus Sicht des Kindes: Reicher Mann schwaengert seine F2M-Transgenderliebschaft, die sich zum Vater erklaeren laesst. Das heiszt dem Kind entgeht neben Pflichtteil bzw. Erbschaft auch der Unterhalt, den man in einer normalen Beziehung nicht abbedingen kann (keine Vertraege zu Lasten Dritter). 

Und wer kein Mitleid mit dem Kind aus monetaeren Gruenden hat, der ist vielleicht ideelen Motiven zugaenglich: so hat das Kind auch noch ein grundgesetzlich geschuetztes Recht auf Kenntnis seiner Abstammung (= biologische Herkunft)...

I replied to other people that of course traffic is only 30% of the total, explained here http://www.airparif.asso.fr/pollution/air-et-climat

the important thing was to compare tobacco smoke to a relevant index either total (0.84% = 3%*30% like you said) or to traffic 3%

both are not insignificant at all, if it was a 1/10000 ratio, then it could be considered a marginal contributor, we are talking about humans generated pollution, by smoking puffing, and this competes on an order of magnitude to pollution generated by machines.  
For example, cows are known to release a vast amount of methane (I'd love to inhale farts everyday instead of tobacco smoke, and their composition is much less likely to mess with our cells), I've not searched but the volume of tobacco smoke per year 110 tons might overcome this number too, even in Paris wide region which have farming

But the thing is smoke harm is more locally, so this 3% figure is to take with precaution, you inhable fumes (at least for me) very often locally (not talking of inside closed environment which cause very high concentration in the long term), in streets, at entries, even in the traffic, we can smell people holding their cigarettes, it shows the importance that noone really consider besides me I feel... 

""we're all killing each other with the wrong math."" that's exactly why I'm writing this, local pollution in some countries, from some people completely unaware if the danger of firing this products..

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; They've been perpetually dicked around by the US since the 90s, just an example would be the fact that they were promised no NATO bases east of Germany in exchange for allowing it's unification and entry into NATO 

I wouldn't call that a 'fact' as:  
1. NATO never made such pledge.  
2. There is no evidence of such promise actually ever existing.  
3. It is not mentioned in any of the relevant agreements, and never came up in the relevant negotiations - and in fact does not even make sense.  
4. Additionally, even if someone had insininuated such idea he obviously did not have the authority to do so on the behalf of NATO or the sovereign countries willing to join NATO.

Here's historical research of the recently declassified relevant archives: [The Myth of a No-NATO-Enlargement Pledge to Russia](http://dialogueeurope.org/uploads/File/resources/TWQ%20article%20on%20Germany%20and%20NATO.pdf)  
*""NATO expansion beyond Germany never even came up during reuniﬁcation negotiations.""*  
*""Declassified materials show unmistakably that no such pledge was made. Valid arguments can be made against NATO enlargement, but this particular argument is spurious.""*

One would expect that believers of such promise could actually show the historical proof of it's existence but alas there's none to be found. So, I would call that a myth. 

And as a historical myth it belongs to the same category with the German post-WWI ""stab-in-the-back"" legend. And, as it happens, there are also some parallers in how those are abused in justifying aggression.

true,CopernicuSagaNeilDT,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; If the US is really at this point then I guess we'll see the end of the Empire sooner than expected. My bet was more on a war with China over Taiwan, but I guess an old enemy does just as well.

&gt; They could simply stop shipping goods to the US... Like it or not, they are still the workshop of the world... 

I'm going to roll these together, because my response to them is applicable to both.

The prospect of an American war with China, without either one openly declaring a desire to rule the world and waging a war of conquest over the entire Earth, is just not realistic.  The US would sell Taiwan out to China with even less discussion than there has been over Ukraine.  Sure, their little island is strategically located, but it's one of many regional allies that lets the US use their territory and airspace.

Now, as we have both discussed in one regard or another, the US and China also have economic ties.  Those ties are worth more to both than an open war for... Taiwan?  Those Senkaku rocks?   That submerged Korean mountain?  Meh.  The US would rather keep China as the workshop and Chinese leadership would rather not risk loosing its best customer, thrusting tens to hundreds of millions of their people into unemployment.  30,000-50,000 have been protesting at their Nike plant.  Imagine if they had just 10% unemployment.  They can't keep building empty cities forever.  That's not to say that it's a one way relationship by any means.

The current US economy needs cheap Chinese crap to keep the knuckle-dragging lumpen-consumer appeased.  That said, the United States can mass produce, can manufacture, has the human capital, the raw materials, and the facilities, technology, and the cash to build - it's just not.  China makes products cheaper, because of lower labor costs and regulations.  I am a strong supporter of the 'Living Wage' and strong regulation, combined with labor unions and worker-directed enterprises, but have you seen who's gaining ground in our political system?  People that want to get rid of the minimum wage, end child labor laws, and use ""religious freedom"" as a reason to deny health insurance (I know, I know... it *should* be universal) to their employees.  They want to compete for the bottom and in a situation where Chinese manufacturing dries up or becomes too costly, those are the policies that will come to fruition.

&gt; So they do have some leverage and apparently they also have a nice new aircraft carrier killer out there.

I know a lot of soldiers.  Guys and ladies that were and were not scarred from Iraq and Afghanistan.  People that are frustrated with the wars, but would go back again and again, because they were told to, because that's what a soldier does.  This is just a new 'boss level' in their *Call of Duty*.  [Here's how](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qawe8R9LFc4) the military is recruiting in the US, now.  These things are fun; don't get me wrong, but while there are people opposed to this kind of thing, they know that most American kids grew up in a nearly perpetual state of war - it's normal for them; it's like a video game.

&gt; See this I am not so sure about. Many people, you too, draw parallels to WWII, but that was a different time, the country was more blue collar and many people still had strong relations back to Europe. Much of that is no longer the case in today's world.

There are two things here.  The first is that I was not exactly intending to use Patton's words as a comparison to WWII.  Patton is a hero among people in America, still today and his words still ring true to many.  Hell, our education system is so bad that I'd be surprised if most of those people that thought him a hero would know where he fought, how he fought, or anything else, but the speech at the beginning of the movie (which was made from actual speeches given by the real Patton, just performed by George C Scott).  The second is that most Americans love WWII and any chance they get to remind the world of how '*we saved yer ass in dubya-dubya two*.'  So, while the parallels to World War two may be questionable, Americans compare any military operation to the glory of WWII.  They compared Noriega, Hussein, Milosevic, Bin Laden, Hussein (again), Bashar Al Assad, even our own President to Adolf Hitler.

&gt; Self-preservation (of lifestyle) seems to be a much higher priority than anything else.

What lifestyle?  Most Americans are in debt up to their eyeballs and would love to have a war economy to 'put America back to work'.  We have more homeless than ever and to cover it up, we arrest the people sleeping on the streets and put them in jail or [in many cases just kill them for 'resisting arrest'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Kelly_Thomas) - I'd post the videos, but it's not something I'd subject a person to, without proper warning.  [We've made it illegal to sleep in cars](http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/the_rich_aim_to_ban_people_from_sleeping_in_cars_because_it_harms_20140416), without finding a way to help those that have to.  [We have prisons, owned by private interests that force inmates to labor for $1 per day](http://truth-out.org/news/item/10548-voluntary-work-program-run-in-private-detention-centers-pays-detained-immigrants-1-a-day), sometimes to make products to sell to American consumers.

America puts on a brave face, but one more shock to the American economy is going to produce a lot a desperate people, who will look to blame someone.  It won't be hard to convince them that the reason is an external threat; one that will unify the American people behind their 'leadership'.

In france, you essentially have two long-distance means of transportation:

- Trains - SNCF (monopoly, book in advance, high prices)
- Planes - several companies, incl. low-cost (also book in advance if possible)

For example, easyjet still has decent prices (cheaper than trains, actually):

- Paris - Nice, May 20 starting at 40 EUR per person

Book on edreams to get cheaper rates:

http://www.edreams.fr/offres/vol/compagnie-aerienne/U2/easyjet/

For smaller towns, you'll have to rely on rented cars or locals mostly. There are **buses** between many cities but they are rather infrequent and packing a round-trip to a smaller city is probably near impossible (do check for yourself, I may be biased).

Around Bordeaux, there are plenty of nice places to visit, Cap Ferret is one of them but [Montpazier](https://www.google.com/search?q=Monpazier&amp;safe=active&amp;es_sm=91&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CmVmU5u4IcOW0AWbo4GABQ&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1411&amp;bih=806) is another example. I think the best you can do is to get a Lonely Planet book (you can buy specific chapters online) and figure things out from there. Lonely Planet usually includes information on transportation.

In the Landes district (where the Marquez ecomusée is located), Mont de Marsan is nice to have a look at and that'd make it a full day. You could also pack the Dune du Pilat which is roughly on the way (Bordeaux - Dune du Pilat - Marquez - Mont de Marsan - Bordeaux) for a full day. I would gladly take you under my wings on that part of the trip. Now, if you do, spend an extra day in Bordeaux for a relaxing day on rented bikes and you won't be disappointed.

Dürfte ein [RSG-8](http://rsg3-shop.com/info-rsg3/rsg8-pfefferspray/index.php), also Pfefferspray sein.

&gt;Warum er das tut, geht aus dem vorliegenden Filmausschnitt nicht hervor, es bleibt also reine Spekulation. 

Da stimm ich dir noch zu

&gt;genauso ist es aber auch möglich, dass hier eine Festnahme vorbereitet wurde oder die Zielperson schon im Vorfeld in bedrohlicher Weise tätig war.

Eine Festnahme wird so nicht durchgeführt. Insbesondere nicht in dem Umfeld. Wenn es nicht spontan ist, wird normalerweise ein Greiftrupp reingeschickt um den Verdächtigen festzunehmen und zwei Greiftrupps sichern derweil gegen potentielle Störer der Festnahme ab. Wenn es spontan wäre (hat genau in dem Moment eine Straftat begangen etc) würde man direkt mit der ganzen Gruppe/ganzen Zug dort reingehen und ihn versuchen zu erwischen. 

Die Langsamkeit mit der der Polizist das Pfefferspray zieht und wie unauffällig er es macht, sowie die relative Gemütlichkeit mit der der Besprühte dort steht schliessen sämliche Möglichkeiten aus.

Zur Bedrohlichkeit: Entweder er hat den Polizisten bedroht, dann wird er in Gewahrsam genommen oder wenn es eine Menschenmenge ist und einzelne Störer rausziehen sich nicht lohnt/nicht möglich ist wird die Menge durch nen kleinen Ausfall zurückgedrängt. 

Die Sache ist einfach das das Verhalten des Polizisten keiner gängigen Polizeitaktik entspricht, noch irgendeinen (gerechtfertigten) Zweck dienlich war. Daher gehe ich sehr stark davon aus, das das nicht rechtmäßig war.

&gt;Das Problem derartiger Videos ist doch, dass je nachdem welcher Ausschnitt einer Situation gezeigt wird, dem Betrachter eine bestimmte Meinung suggeriert werden soll. Über die Rechtmäßigkeit einer Maßnahme läßt sich auf einer solchen Grundlage aber nicht urteilen.

A tabloid named *Se &amp; Hør* got caught paying ~1300EUR/month for strictly confidential credit card information from Nets, the firm which runs our national credit card *Dankortet*, and out national online identification system(!). The leaked info is eg ""Prince Joakim withdrew €40 at this gas tank in France"". They got this from an inside system administrator at IBM, who worked in a department recently acquired from Nets after IBM took over the running of Nets' servers. Commentators have called this bigger than England's News of the World scandal.

Later it turns out that the lowly support people at Nets also had full access to everybody's credit card history, and had been using this to spy on girlfriends' etc.

There are indications that the security at Nets is ""lacking"" (did I mention they were also our national online ID system provider, giving access to eg all communications between state and citizens). It turns out that Nets were told about the leak in January 2013, but apparently did nothing.

Labour day: Our Social Democratic-lead cabinet has been following an economically quite right wing policy for the last couple of years, which recently caused the left-wing party SF to leave the government. At the traditional Labour day speech in Fælledparken, Social Democratic Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt was heckled quite comprehensibly. There are rumors that Thorning is looking for a job in the EU, because as it looks right now her own party members hate her, and she looks certain to be lose the next election and be ousted as Social Democratic leader.

That said, a system of language is a unique way of expressing existence and it should be preserved at any cost.  
A culture is people with shared beliefs and similar expressions of those beliefs. It is a very fluid concept, memetics play a huge part in it, as does individualism. If there is such a thing as a national culture (even though two individuals from the same country can be as different as night and day - a church-going working father of three vs. gay homeless performance artist, for example - they still share some basic views on the nature of the world as has been laid down to them by either education, their peers, families, mass media, laws, via history etc.), there can also be a European culture.  
It is time to start seriously thinking about what this culture is, how to define it and how to start expressing it. At this point in time I think that this can be done with a trans-national (also, in their beliefs, fervently post-national) cultural aristocracy; a cultural avant-garde with this single goal in mind. 

Without a shared culture, shared media-space and a shared understanding that we are all in this together, the economic and political project of Europe will fail.  
 My European Dream Nation would therefore be a federation of post-national states, working to preserve their local ways of experiencing the society and the world (mainly language, and all the cultural webs that come with it), and engaging in a creative competition with the centripetal force of a truly European culture.

La parte che mi pesa di più, però, quella che proprio non riesco a sopportare è il populismo e sono stanco di vedere l'ignoranza scientifica in giro: per esempio sono stanco di vedere gente che difende stamina e ti dà dell'ignorante. Sapere che quelle persone non cambieranno opinione qualsiasi cosa io gli dica in qualche modo mi mette tristezza. Non c'è niente al mondo in grado di correggere la loro ignoranza, niente. Vale lo stesso per i vegani che cercano di imporsi (nulla contro i vegani tranquilli), i cristiani e la loro incoerenza, i grillini estremisti, insomma credo si capisca quale tipo di gente. La cosa peggiore è che io alle volte non riesco affatto a non considerare queste persone come inferiori in un certo senso, non mi so dare una spiegazione. Sono persone alle quali non mi viene proprio di parlare e alle volte vorrei che il mondo venisse diviso tra le persone ignoranti come quelle e poi gli altri.

E insomma, privilegiare di più il rapporto umano che non mi eviterebbe quella gente ma magari aiuterebbe.

J'ai dit qu'on ne pouvait pas comparer la situation vu que les deux pays ont des attitudes différentes vis-à-vis des immigrés.

Encore une fois tu tires des conclusions à partir de rien.

&gt;en effet la France a ceci de particulier qu'elle a été demandeuse de l'établissement de population du Maghreb dans les cités

Historiquement faux. L'immigration qu'on a fait venir, une immigration exclusivement de travail (c'est à dire avant 1975 et le début du chômage de masse) habitait dans des foyers ou pire et devait repartir. Celle qui habite dans les cités est une immigration de peuplement à laquelle la France n'a jamais demandé de venir.

Parallèlement, les grands ensembles étaient eux habités par des ouvriers qualifiés et des classes moyennes (non immigrés) jusqu'à cette époque. [Comme l'explique cet article](http://www.revue-projet.com/articles/2007-4-les-banlieues-populaires-ont-aussi-une-histoire/), c'est vers 1976 que les classes moyennes commencent à quitter les grands ensembles pour accéder à la propriété, et seront remplacés par les immigrés :

*C’est par le jeu des départs que se fera l’entrée des familles d’ouvriers issues de l’immigration dans le parc social. Les organismes qui gèrent les cités d’habitat social accueillent ces nouveaux locataires, d’autant que la loi Barre rend solvables les familles les plus modestes. L’idée est de répartir les familles immigrées au milieu des ménages français, suivant des quotas d’environ 15 %. Mais le souci d’intégrer les immigrés dans le logement social conduit à des logiques territoriales de regroupement communautaire qui n’ont été ni pensées, ni anticipées : les familles maghrébines deviennent majoritaires aux Minguettes au cours des années 1970. En Seine-Saint-Denis, la population scolaire étrangère passe de 17 % à 30 % entre 1975 et 1983. En 1992, 74 % des ménages maghrébins sont locataires d’une Hlm.*

Tout ça s'est fait petit à petit, les non immigrés ont progressivement quitté les cités et laissé les immigrés entre eux.

Peut-on leur reprocher étant donné les différences culturelles que j'ai déjà notées dans mon précédent commentaire ?

true,Asyx,NRHW,"North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany","Yes. Shifting. But the only languages where it's completely gone now are English and I think Afrikaans at least if we talk about Indo-European languages. Even the Celtic languages (which are basically Welsh and Irish these days) still have genders as far as I know even though English (the native or close to native language of every single Welsh and Irish speaker) doesn't. So it would be logical to scrap them as well but nobody did (and there were reforms at least for Irish). 

Afrikaans is an exported language which was influenced by languages spoken in South Africa including Xhosa and Zulu (the ones with the clicks) and English so Afrikaans is in a quite special situation regarding shifts in grammar but I'm not even sure if Afrikaans got rid of the gender.

In English, gender got lost because of sound shifts. Cases and gender were just not marked in an obvious fashion any more. Considering that English is highly influenced by French and North Germanic languages, the mess got even muddier. 

Today, a sound shift is even less likely. Languages are standardised for TV and stuff. People are bitching about wrong pronunciation more than they are about politics. People invested years of their lives learning to write properly and expressing themselves intelligently. It takes you 2 seconds to look up how a word is pronounced. People are used to the idea that they can't speak in their local dialect if they meet people from other regions.

To get rid of genders without people specifically regulating the language, which would start a shit storm if they actually changed grammar rules so drastically, you'd need to change the habits of 100 million people (that's roughly the number of native German speakers, isn't it?) and those might not even be their native dialect. People in rural areas might need to use the standard dialect a few times per year in the touristy season so getting them to speak differently is fucking hard. So a sound shift wouldn't even spread through the whole country.

It will not happen in German because it's in such a normal state compared to where English was back then. Due to standardised spelling and standardised neutral dialects, something like what happened to English or other languages where genders collapsed is very unlikely. In the same way, it's very unlikely that Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Spanish or whatever will go through major changes soon.

Since I already mentioned Norwegian, they've got 2 major dialect groups. One with 2 genders and guttural R and without retroflex consonants (spoken in Berg) and one with 3 genders and thrilled R and with retroflex consonants (spoken in Oslo). And they are a lot more forgiving in terms of dialects and accents then we are. In fact, a lot of people recommend not learning Norwegian because it will take so long to get used to the different dialects and other Scandinavian languages might be a better option then especially because in those countries, people might be a bit more used to switching around their accent. Everything that might happen to German will happen to Norwegian first. Also, keep in mind that Norwegians don't dub. We dub everything. Even bloody Doctor Who. So in case you want to bring up widespread English skills or something like that, the Norwegians would be ahead of us on that matter as well.

Also, bitching about gender is fucking pathetic. Yes, it's hard and unusual for somebody that isn't used to that but why even bother learning a language if you can't accept different grammatical structures and functionality. I'm not telling you to get rid of the useless continuous tenses, do I?",0,1399226277,null,0,false,0,ch9dgbp,t3_24nxem,t1_ch9dgbp,t1_ch9cicb,null,1433647677,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Why would they? Would the United States of America give residency and a welfare stipend, however small, to an EU citizen who showed up there without a job? Would they care about their previous work history in the EU? Would any country outside the EU? 

&gt;But, the idea that the money I get is somehow good money, and somehow justifies treating me as if I'm a parasite, is unacceptable.

The way that some immigrants see EU countries as their personal ATM, is also wholly unacceptable. Especially with the current economic climate.

Je vois très bien où tu veux en venir avec tes insinuations. Ça ne marche pas, arrête stp.

La réalité, c'est que les familles sont venues alors que le chômage de masse apparaissait et que par conséquent il n'y avait pas d'avenir pour elles.

C'est la triste réalité. Sans travail, aucune chance d'amélioration des conditions, donc concentration des pauvres dans les mêmes endroits.

&gt;Je parie que tu ne vas aussi pas mentionner les bidonvilles de l'époque..

J'ai dit : ""Une immigration exclusivement de travail (c'est à dire avant 1975 et le début du chômage de masse) habitait dans des foyers **ou pire**.""

Et je ne vois pas le rapport avec la discussion. Tu pourrais reconnaître que tu as eu tort quand tu as dit ""la France a ceci de particulier qu'elle a été demandeuse de l'établissement de population du Maghreb dans les cités"".

Je corrigeais cette vision qui est historiquement fausse et pourtant qui est répétée trop souvent.

&gt;Quant à l'""attitude"" j'aimerais que tu me dises concrètement, en quoi c'est cette attitude qui peut avoir un effet positif

Je n'ai pas parlé d'effet positif ou négatif. J'ai parlé de faits, cette chose qui manque cruellement dans tes commentaires.

J'ai dit que la Suisse et la France ont des attitudes différentes vis-à-vis des immigrés, ce qui est prouvé par les votations.

Précise ce que tu entends pas ""positif"" ou ""négatif"". Quels critères  te permettent de juger quelque chose d'aussi subjectif.

&gt;Quel est le mécanisme par lequel en votant des lois islamophobes on peut rendre les comportements de certains plus civils?

Je n'ai pas parlé de lois islamophobes, j'ai parlé de votations sur les immigrés. Je note qu'encore une fois, sans aucun élément, tu effectues ce glissement malhonnête ""contre l'immigration = islamophobe"".

J'ai dit ""avertissement aux immigrés"" et tu as immédiatement transformé cela en ""avertissement aux 
musulmans"".

Par ailleurs, j'ai dit dans [ce commentaire](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/24nv8o/im_tired_of_this/ch989wx) que ce n'était pas l'islam qui était en cause.

Je ne vois pas l'intérêt de poursuivre une discussion avec quelqu'un qui dit des choses fausses sans preuve et interprète mes propos de manière malhonnête.

If I get a “Lieber Herr …” in response I will either respond in kind or more likely with something like “Hallo Herr …” or “Guten Tag Herr …” (I’m personally not a fan of the “Lieber” address). Whether I leave in or out the “Professor” depends mostly on my mood and my own judgement on how important titles are to the person I write to.

Similarly, “Mit freundlichen Grüßen …” would be replaced with a more appropriate “Viele Grüße …” when using “Hallo Herr …” or “Guten Tag Herr …”.

Of course, if I get a “Sehr geehrter Herr …” back I will also respond in kind – but to be honest, that hasn’t ever happened to me when writing to Professors (it has happened with other people working at the university). Your mileage may vary.

I don’t think that’s rude. Within reason less formal greetings are ok if both sides use them and the, well, more senior side started using them. With titles it’s a bit more complex. If in doubt there is nothing wrong with using them, but I don’t think I’m wrong if I say that in Germany not everyone expects to always be addressed by title, though many do.

That said, I think most Professors will care more about you keeping your emails relevant, short and to the point, considering the email load they most likely have to work through.

&gt; This annoys me too, but not for your reason. It deprives native English speakers of a lot of things. There just are experiences that you can't have with English only. You'll never get a real understanding of the hierarchies in Japanes society, for example, if you don't try to learn their language a bit. Cultures and languages are intertwined to a certain degree, and the self-imposed language barrier is a detriment to them, not us.

Couldn't have said it better. I like his videos a lot and we obviously share many of the same interests, but he's simply dead wrong on the language issue for exactly the reason you mentioned.

English is my native language. I lived near Miami as a child and learnt a fair bit of Spanish, but stopped using it when I moved away around the age of 8 or so. I wasn't able to learn a new language until I started French when I was 14. I studied it for about 5 years but for some reason it came so naturally to me that I'd call myself almost fluent in French. I've actually had French people tell me that they thought I was French until I told them I wasn't. I've also studied German for a few years (German was as difficult for me as French was easy). I did a few years of Japanese during my degree. Also, due to my Croatian ancestry, I've applied for citizenship of Croatia and stayed there for several months. It's a *stupidly* difficult language but I'm very keen to learn it for personal reasons.

I feel so lucky to have English as my first language, but knowing other languages opens up a whole new window into another culture that's not as readily expressed in a second language like English. So much humour and history is lost in translation without a thorough knowledge of another language. Not only that, but I unscientifically believe that knowing additional languages improves other cognitive skills like musical ability. Not to mention that it helps you grow and develop as a person, being able to see another language group and its speakers not as foreigners but as people who have similar thoughts and dreams and ambitions, and hearing them be able to communicate those thoughts and ambitions in a language you understand. It's a good feeling.

I'm all for an extensive form of dual language immersion education sweeping not just Anglosphere countries, but most places. ",0,1399228359,null,0,false,0,ch9ebxu,t3_24nxem,t1_ch9ebxu,t1_ch95ynt,null,1433648089,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Of course they don't. You have previous work history in the EU. If you did, you could claim welfare for 90 days and the EU country you previously worked in, would pick up the tab. America has no such agreement with the EU. 

If an EU citizen should up at American border control, with no work visa and hopes to study (for free), with no English and no way of supporting themselves they would be laughed and deported. No welfare, language classes or any of that.

Instead of constantly moaning, you should be thanking the Finns for being very forthcoming in their hospitality. 


&gt;And learning the language doesn't mean you'll instantly get work. You're still competing with natives, and they have the advantage.

An Americans have the advantage in America. It's extremely difficult for skilled foreigners to find work there legally. Even harder again for unskilled immigrants. 

I'm gonna be harsh here. You have been in the country for two years plus (18 months last june?), you don't speak the language, are finding it near impossible to find work and on benefits. Then you go on to say:

&gt;My ex beat me and controlled my life for a year and a half. I've only been free of him since June and I think I've made a lot of progress

Sorry to hear that. Anyway, this move. It doesn't sound like it's working out and you don't sound like a happy camper. When do you throw the towel in? Or are you just going to stay on benefits and hope that you eventually find employment? The Finns are a very accommodating folk! This shit just wouldn't fly outside of the EU. Hence why people here sometimes get worked up about. The EU is not a global soup kitchen.

Edit: I had a look at the link provided. Are you a right wing troll?

&gt;You'll never work as hard in your entire fucking life as most unemployed immigrants do.

I might start stating where each individual report comes from, in terms of the news source.  Azernews, APA, and Chilen are all the Azeri news agencies, which are all state-owned.  Panorama.am, Asbarez, Armenpress, and Aysor are all the Armenian news agencies, in which only Armenpress is state-owned.

**Conflict News**

* Azerbaijan [demands](http://www.azernews.az/azerbaijan/66691.html) James Warlick, president of the OCSE Minsk Group, to be discharged from his position.  In the article, Azerbaijan states that ""Azerbaijani officials have recently voiced dissatisfaction with the U.S. co-chair of the OSCE Minsk group because of his pro-Armenian position.""  Also according to the article, ""Warlick actively uses social networks to convey his thoughts on the peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.""  Azerbaijan again states here that the OCSE chairmen are ""attempting"" to ""present the ""separatist regime"" of the NKR as a party in negotiations.

* Simultaneously, James Warlick [met](http://times.am/?p=41585&amp;l=en) with members of the Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA).

* The US [calls on](http://en.trend.az/news/politics/2270094.html) Armenia and Azerbaijan to peacefully solve the conflict.

* OSCE co-chairs [discussed](http://en.trend.az/news/karabakh/2267895.html) the conflict in Poland.

* Switzerland Foreign Minister/OCSE co-chairman Didier Burkhalter's will [visit](http://www.azernews.az/azerbaijan/66679.html) Baku.

**NKR NEWS**

* Tomorrow the California Assembly Rules Committee will [vote](http://www.panorama.am/en/politics/2014/05/03/kalifornia-nkr/) on a resolution to recognize the NKR.  If it is passed, I will probably do something special for next week!

* On Wikipedia NKR page, a [new map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Nagorno-Karabakh_Republic_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg) was been uploaded!  Big thanks to user:Kentronhayastan!  The new map is more detailed, and it even has South Sudan!

* Former NKR president Arkady Ghukasian will be [appointed](http://www.aysor.am/en/news/2014/05/01/arkadi-ghukasyan/) secretary of Armenia’s National Security Council (NSC).

* NKR Prime Minister Ara Harutyunyan [hosted](http://www.panorama.am/en/politics/2014/05/03/bako-sahakyan/) Spanish Parliament MEPS and MPs, as part of the European Friends of Armenia organization.  Bako Sahakyan was also present.

* The conflict was [discussed](http://times.am/?p=41574&amp;l=en) at Tufts University, which is an American university in the outskirts of Boston.

**Video of the Week**

* [This](http://youtube.com/watch?v=IN0qjCUigac) short video talks about the roots about Karabakhs struggle for freedom, and the conflicts roots.

* military storage exploded, 20 perished [including 10 people who tried to escape in a truck](http://top.rbc.ru/incidents/30/04/2014/921342.shtml);

This is a sign 1) how bad is infrastructure of the country for business and 2) government wasn't ready for the situation with sanctions and cannot control its own pocket companies;

* IMF says [Russian economy is in recession already](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27221345), Russian media decorated news about it with a lot of doublespeak - like ""IMF admitted Russian economy is in recession"" (as if it was IMF who did something bad, not the government);

What makes this inevitable is that GDP is still shrinking at 2.3% per annum.

I guess that's what who cares now how many years of austerity does to you.   It makes your numbers inevitable.

So what's going to happen is that either Greece will default, in the same way that a man who is bleeding to death will eventually die.

Or Greece will get debt relief; that would be great.

Or Greece will get debt relief and then default.

He also blasted Brussels accounting method of using a so called ""future values"" accounting trick which he says is the main reason Brussels counts Greece GDP/Debt Ratio so high.

Ottimo anche il più recente *Il Mostro di Firenze: uno, qualcuno, centomila*, che quantomeno è aggiornato sulle ultime svolte delle indagini, e che ha il pregio di mostrare un bell'affresco sociale sulla vicenda, utile per capire cosa significava sopravvivere in quel tipo di sottoproletariato sperduto tra le campagna toscane.

- : Belgian authorities have banned a planned gathering today of far-right figures including the French comic Dieudonne, after it was slammed by Jewish groups as an “anti-Semitic hatefest”.

- Citing security risks, the mayor of the Brussels district of Anderlecht banned both the meeting and any street protests connected to it, the Belga news agency reported.

- It was to bring together a string of controversial far-right figures, including the comedian Dieudonne M’bala M’bala, who has faced repeated accusations of anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial and incitement to racial hatred.

- Organisers of the so-called “European Dissidents’ Congress” — a Brussels bookshop and a group called “Debout les Belges!” (Belgians, Rise up!) — had kept its venue secret until the last moment to prevent it from being banned.

- The leader of “Debout Les Belges!,” far-right lawmaker Laurent Louis, upheld the invitation to the event in spite of the ban.  “Our guests have confirmed they will be coming, and in any event — ban or no ban — you can meet them and spend an unforgettable day,” Louis wrote on his Facebook page.  “Do not give in to pressure and come with your families, in calm and good spirits.”

Je suis désolé, je suis vraiment désolé de le faire, mais je vais casser un petit peu le mythe. 

Bill Gates est le fils de William Gates II qui est un des hommes les plus riches de la Californie. Son grand père a William a fait du commerce avec les indiens-americains et son arrière grand père était un Lord britannique. Il est allé dans une école privé extrêmement cher qui avait un des rares ordinateurs des États Unis et il a été introduit au PDG de IBM.  Tu a mal choisi ton exemple. Ensuite, le père de Warren Buffet a été entre autre président de la commission des finances des États Unis. 

Quand a Larry Page et Zuckerberg, l'argent n'est pas la seule forme de capital, il y aussi le capital culturel. Ils viennent de familles juives extrêmement cultivées et qui accordent une très grande importance a l'éducation de leurs enfants. Je t'invite, si ça t’intéresse a lire les propos passionnants de [Jed Rubenfeld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Yy2LQczlQ8&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=121) , professeur émérite de Droit a Yale (excusez du peu..), qui explique pourquoi les enfants de certains milieux culturels (asiatiques, juif, etc..) réussissent tellement bien.

Da der Beamte eine Sprühflasche dieser Substanz als Teil seiner Riot-Ausrüstung in einem speziell dafür angelegtem Holster trägt, handelt es sich entweder um Pfefferspray oder Tränengas, höchstwahrscheinlich Pfefferspray. Tränengas (CS-Gas) wurde vor einigen Jahren als Einsatzmittel der Polizei durch Pfefferspray entsetzt.

&gt;genauso ist es aber auch möglich, dass hier eine Festnahme vorbereitet wurde oder die Zielperson schon im Vorfeld in bedrohlicher Weise tätig war.


Das Video zeigt neben der konkreten Attacke auch das direkte Umfeld und fängt die ""Stimmung"" vor Ort ein. Wie man zu Videobeginn über die linke Schulter des Beamten und kurz darauf bei der Attacke sehen kann, machen die Opfer keinerlei Anstalten, die Beamten körperlich anzugehen. Es handelt sich also ganz offensichtlich nicht um Notwehr. Die Anwendung von Pfefferspray zur Durchsetzung von ""unmittelbarem Zwang"" (Festnahme, ""Vertreiben"" von einem bestimmten Ort) ist zum einen rechtlich höchst kritisch, zum anderen aber hier offensichtlich nicht gegeben. Der Reizgaseinsatz findet gezielt gegen zwei Personen statt und dient also nicht dem Vorgehen gegen eine Menschenmenge, die hinter einer Absperrung steht o.ä.. Da der Täter sich nach der Attacke sofort wegdreht und auch seine Kollegen keinerlei Anstalten zu einer Festnahme machen, würde ich ziemlich sicher davon ausgehen, dass die beiden Opfer dem Täter ""dumm gekommen"" sind und er ihnen durch den Reizgaseinsatz ""eine Lektion erteilen"" wollte.

è ormai assodato, sia dal punto di vista giudiziario che dalle indagini giornalistiche, che i mandanti fossero altrove, e tutte le piste portano a Perugia, in particolare ad un medico morto suicida in circostanze un po' bislacche (Narducci).

Questo medico e i suoi sodali, probabilmente appassionati di occultismo, hanno conosciuto pacciani e soci in alcune orge che si svolgevano nella campagna toscana, e li hanno assoldati, pagandoli un bel po' (Pacciani era sospettosamente ricco), per portargli pezzi di donne che loro usavano per un qualche non specificato rito.

Il primo omicidio del mostro di firenze è infatti stato fatto con una precisione che non è stata mai riscontrata nei successivi, per cui si sospetta che fosse stato fatto dalla mano di un esperto (medico) con strumenti adatti, e non con i coltellacci che poi hanno usato Pacciani e co. Per cui l'interpretazione che si dà è che ci sia stata una specie di lezione da parte di un medico ai compagni di merende di come si stagliuzza un cadavere.

Il pattern è che i feticci richiesti fossero sempre di donne, ed è buffo (se si può usare questo termine) che beccarono quella coppia gay tedesca di cui uno poteva sembrare una donna, a causa dei capelli lunghi. A questi infatti non è stato asportato nulla, se non ricordo male. Mi sono sempre immaginato Pacciani e Vanni quando hanno scoperto che si trattava di un uomo.

Long answer: until the 1990's matura was centralized and the exam questions were transmitted by radio. It worked rather well and it was very cheap. For political reasons it got cancelled, each school has to organize their own exams. 

As schools competed for more students (schools get money strictly for headcount) requirements were lowered and lowered until matura became virtually worthless.

In 1999 policians set up an institute to think about new centralized model.  The institute consumed incredibly lot of money (almost 1 billion CZK) and after decade of research came up with the current monstrosity. Few years ago it was implemented in practice, in spite of protests.

It was disaster from the start. The first year math questions were so complicated that even many teachers said they would fail. Public complained. The next year the pendulum swung in the other way - only a total idiot would fail the exam. People complained again.

Eventually the matura got washed down to uselessness. Almost everyone gets through, it has no practical use anywhere (e.g. instead of entrance tests for universities), only the high cost remains (for comparison: this year Slovakia has their centralized matura for 1/15 of our costs).

In 2008 they unanimously voted for more autonomy in a referendum. The Greenlandic parliament has 31 seats. 27 of the MPs represent parties that support separatism. The Danish state recommended that Greenland should restrict the sale of mining rights to Chinese companies because they already have almost full control of the market on rare earth minerals. Greenland refused to do so. Probably in order to become more economically independent from Denmark so they can get complete independence soon. 

That site you linked to seems like a pretty biased pro-nordic paper, if you ask me. It's partly funded by the Swedish state. [Here's another unbelievably biased poll](http://www.nyagenda.dk/ee/index.php/agenda/artikler/markant_flertal_for_nordisk_forbund_i_stedet_for_eu_medlemskab) from 2004, which shows that 47% of Danes want closer Nordic cooperation instead of the EU. Maybe you can use it the next time someone questions your great plans for a nordic union?

Did you read through the thread about the English language that was on the front page earlier? There were [a bunch](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/24nxem/non_native_english_speakers_of_europe_do_you_feel/ch962zx) of [Finns](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/24nxem/non_native_english_speakers_of_europe_do_you_feel/ch93rp4) there, who were angry and cursed their politicians for allowing Swedish to remain an official language. 

&gt;Language is secondary anyhow to the people feeling like they belong to a community. 

Language is very central to having a common identity. At least for me. 

&gt;Nordic people have a strong community from a very very long time ago.

true,TheTT,BERL,Berlin,"&gt; Das Gesetz erlaubt nur die Feststellung der Vaterschaft, nicht aber der Mutterschaft.

Im Kern geht es darum, dass bei der Geburt die Person, aus der das Kind rauskommt, als Mutter eingetragen wird. Bei der Vaterschaft dagegen ist es weniger eindeutig, und deswegen gibt es da Möglichkeiten, gerichtlich die Vaterschaft zu bekommen oder loszuwerden.

Beispiel: Aus dir kommt ein Kind raus, aber du lässt dich als Vater eintragen, eine Mutter gibts nicht. Der biologische Vater - den du nicht an sein Kind lassen willst - kann jetzt die Vaterschaft nicht mehr einklagen, weil es schon einen eindeutigen Vater gibt. Damit er diese Möglichkeit hat, musst du die Mutter sein. Da ein Kind aus dir rausgekommen ist, bist du ja vermutlich auch die biologische Mutter und möchtest der juristische Vater sein, weil du transsexuell bist. Wenn das Gericht dir das erlauben würde, hätte das tiefgreifende Konsequenzen für das Familienrecht, und deswegen wird da unterhalb von BVerfG/Bundestag nichts bei rauskommen. 

Bei einer neuen Gesetzgebung in dem Bereich müsste man dann auch mal überlegen, wie man mit ""Dreiecksbeziehungen"" wie der Leihmutterschaft umgeht. Mutter/Vater ist letztlich ja nur eine Begriffsfrage, aber dass da eine dritte Person reinspielen könnte, eröffnet ganz andere Probleme. Und wenn wir mal anfangen, mehr als nur zwei Personen einzutragen, dann werden Adoptiveltern (nicht ganz zu Unrecht) auch fordern, offiziell als Eltern geführt zu werden.

It makes learning and reading German needlessly tedious for non-natives who aren't let in on this secret; and well, with that, the average human will continue not learning German and the anglicization of each generation of languages that fail to attract more users will continue.  Except, ethnic Germans in the future will have maybe 200-300 years of German Language Video/Audio to go back to.  That will be nice.  Shame the Romans did not even a phonograph.

true,KaiserVonIkapoc,ESPA,Yurop Stronk,"I'm completely for a European Federation with these points:

* An Eighth Schedule-like system similar to India's that recognizes each European language. Allows them to be used at local and regional levels. In return, English would be the official language of the entire union. Effectively allows states to have their own language, and keep our business end professional and comprehensive to foreign nationals.

* States divided between cultures and nationality. Catalonia, Occitania, Flanders/Walloonians, etc. In return, each state would conglomerate into a regional federation (I.E. Iberian Federation, Scandinavia, Britannia, etc.)

* A pan-European model of economics modeled akin to the Nordic Model with a sovereign wealth fund.

* A strong, well-prepped European army with a twist. Our general army would be strong and advanced with some branches. We'd have our soldiers double as construction workers, akin to how the Romans did with their frontier fortresses. A swell, a gendarmerie and a European Foreign Legion. Effectively we'd have well-trained soldiers and great labour sources to mix with civilians.

* What monarchies remain in Europe would become a Holy Roman Empire-esque elective monarchy. Effectively, an 'emperor/empress' that all of Europe can look to for pride and stability under. A light in shining darkness.

* A great, progressive foreign policy designed to help European interests and her allies. For our non-European allies, we'd send strong peacekeeping forces when asked. As well, humanitarian aid combined with a combined force to make sure it reaches target and is distributed correctly.

*  With the United Kingdom within the federation, it opens up greater possibilities for relations. With an aim towards creating a Commonwealth Realm, it'd give us a long-term edge over other powers. Though this won't have a Schengen Area, it'd be a step towards a unified Europe and a realm of partners.

* The Federal Commonwealths of Africa. With the surge of African immigrants across Spain, Italy, etc., there'd be a referendum. If we had to, we'd come back to Africa to 'recolonize' them without the same mistakes our ancestors did. If they want European-like stability, they'll be doing it on our terms. An African realm that, over the span of decades or even a century, would be slowly remodeled with federal commonwealths that enforces universal human rights. Build an Africa that'd unite with us to create an even more powerful federation.

The FCA would be divided into five specific federations: North, South, East, West, and Central. Commonwealths would be shaped based on cultural, national, and linguistics. No more half-assed cut up and run. We'll do this the hard way if necessary.

* The Russian Question. With a unified European Federation that sees a fine line from Turkey to Finland to Ukraine and Belarus, we'd apply pressure on Russia. Tough sanctions, squeeze the oligarchs by the balls. As jingoistic and dangerous as this sounds, collapsing the Russian Federation may be the only way to end the shitfest it's been since the decline of the USSR. Once broken, the Federation would begin a slow, thoughtful process of helping the Russians. 

As we slowly bring Russians into the fold, deprogram and have them change into proper Europeans. Depending on public opinion, it's either we stop at the Urals or march on towards Vladivostok. As we go, we'd create new federations and states until Russia is now part of us.

* The [Atlantropa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantropa) project would be resurrected to connect Africa and Europe together. However, unlike the racist attitudes during its construction, this one would be designed to help the EF and the FCA come together far closer than before. New lands for us to relieve pressures of overpopulation, and hopefully pave a permanent tie between Africa and Europe.

* Immigration policy. In the extremely unlikely possibility that the Commonwealth Realms, FCA, and European Federation are formed in this image, it'd require a greater policy. A comprehensive immigration designed to help people integrate with the regional culture and language while making sure they can stand on their own two feet.

* A system devised to help record and collect cultures, languages, and practices for the future. Even as languages gradually die out, we'd have ways to study them for time to come. As this way, we'd allow our descendants to learn from a world wholly unlike their own.

* A strong anti-corruption board. Nobody wants to see Europe or a potential federation collapse to corruption like Spain, Portugal, Italy, or Greece. Methods to fight back against and minimize corruption would be emplaced. 

* And lastly, for the time being, a pan-European constitution that allows freedom of speech, religion, expression, etc., with no way to abridge or manipulate it. It can be amended, but they're firmly grounded. This way, we can have the freedom we all desire with a guarantee that no one can take it from you.


Even if this isn't completely what I believe in, this feels like an acceptable amount to convey to everyone how I'd want to see Europe go.

No foreigner I know has major problems with gender. Not even the 40 years old dude from Morocco I know from uni who learnt German when he was almost 30. 

Borrowed words from English have gender as well. Everything has a gender. That's the point. Almost every single Dutchmen speaks English. The Dutch language is not dying out. Why would German?

&gt; How many German speakers will be left by the 22nd century?

As many as there are Germans, Austrians and German-Swiss. There are 320k people in Iceland and the Icelandic language survived Norwegian and Danish rule for centuries. 

&gt; who aren't let in on this secret

Get a good text book. That's the secret. If your text book doesn't introduce you to genders and gives you the hint that learning nouns with the article might be a good idea, throw it away. It's useless and shit for beginners. That counts for every gendered language.

&gt; It makes learning and reading German needlessly tedious for non-natives

No. You're just lazy. There are languages way harder than German for the majority of the people. Japanese has 2000 regularly used and 5000 common characters in their logography in total that have a rather abstract meaning, readings you have to learn by heart (at least 2. Sometimes split so that they change based on the next syllable) in addition to 2 roughly 50 characters big syllabaries that cover the same syllables. In addition to that, they've got over a hundred counters and particles. THAT is tedious. And everybody who criticises Japanese for that without being a native speaker can fuck off as well.

And I do not care how German will evolve. I just want people to leave German alone and see what happens. If genders collapse than so be it. It happened in a lot of languages after all though usually not completely. I just can't stand that you look for shit excuses why certain features of the German language are not acceptable because you are too lazy to learn them.

And I don't understand how reading Germans is more complicated than reading English due to genders. If you know that ""der, die, das"" translates to ""the"", everything is fine. That's how you learn the gender. It doesn't affect your ability to read the language it only affects the way you write or speak which can be fixed by listening and reading and repetition because, unlike cases, genders aren't complicated grammatical features. You learn what a gender is and what it does (again, good text book), learn the vocabulary with the article and the rest happens on it's own if you continue to consume German media instead of assuming that you're done with the language as soon as you finished your text book or has successfully read Faust or something like that.",0,1399243373,null,0,false,0,ch9l1l9,t3_24nxem,t1_ch9l1l9,t1_ch9jhro,null,1433651318,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

These two articles explain the situation.  

First, from an [April 2013 New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/world/europe/europes-shrinking-military-spending-under-scrutiny.html):

The United States finances nearly three-quarters of NATO’s military spending, up from 63 percent in 2001....

“We are moving toward a Europe that is a combination of the unable and the unwilling,” said Camille Grand, a French military expert who directs the Foundation for Strategic Research. “European countries are continuing to be free riders, instead of working seriously to see how to act together.” 

-end quote-

Another [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/27/world/europe/europe-begins-to-rethink-cuts.html) from March of 2014 describes European contributions to NATO: 

NATO has agreed that member countries should spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense and should cooperate more to reduce expensive overlaps. But the economic crisis has hit Europe hard, making budget cuts necessary and military budgets among the easiest areas to cut politically.

Last year, only a handful of NATO countries met the target, according to NATO figures, including the United States, at 4.1 percent, and Britain, at 2.4 percent. Estonia was at 2 percent, and debt-saddled Greece still spent 2.3 percent. France was at 1.9 percent and Turkey and Poland were at 1.8 percent, while Italy spent just 1.2 percent of its G.D.P.

Spain and Hungary, along with the apparently vulnerable Baltic countries Latvia and Lithuania, were spending less than 1 percent. Even Germany, which is relatively wealthy, was spending only 1.3 percent. Over all, European members of NATO were at 1.6 percent.

-------------------------
Democratic and governmental reform

&gt;The legislative system must be more democratic and have an overhaul. [This is the current model for governance.](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/45367000/gif/_45367721_parl_powers_gra3001.gif) It ought to change at some point. I propose we scrap the commission, give the European parliament slight power over the council of ministers, and replace the commission with a supreme court which supervises over the two houses. 

&gt;The council should also have more seats than it does at the moment, but it should be a technocratic house. The parliament should have roughly 2 or 3 times the number of seats the council has. Each party, or maybe national government could perhaps appoint a professional in order to guide the parliament. For example, maybe we'd want a scientist for advice on.. climate change for example. We should have more intellectuals in government.

&gt;I don't know how to balance the power between the parliament and the council. I don't want to allow parliament to just be able to override the council, but at the same time, I want the parliament to be able to make informed decisions. In the UK, the lords house is appointed, but they can delay the commons into rethinking their law. They can't stop it, just delay. I don't think that's effective. Maybe if the houses disagree, every council member and MEP votes on it. Each is given one vote, but the parliament has twice the number of MEPs to every one councilor. Something like that maybe. The parliament should also have more seats. The ratio of citizen to MP should be about half a million, which gives us about a thousand MEPs.

&gt;With the commission replaced with the supreme court, we have a link between the legislative and judicial branch. The parliament appoints the supreme judges, but they watch over parliament, the council, and the presidency, in order to make sure they follow some sort of democratic, liberal principle. I'm not suggesting a constitution. I think the constitution is too short and simple. I'm suggesting a series of laws. Human rights, a liberty and democracy manifesto, details of how governance works. A series of long documents emphasizing the rights of the citizens, and how they must always take priority over the needs of the government. 

&gt; A president is also elected by the people. S/he gives the EU a general direction in which to carry political momentum. This system all sounds rather chaotic at the moment, and there will be certain times in which decisions must be made hastily, where time is of the essence. He can declare a state of emergency, but it must be ratified by a simple majority of the supreme court. The president also has powers of executive orders, in which he can override parliamentary decisions. However, this requires a two thirds approval from the supreme court. In return, the parliament has the power to impeach the president by a two thirds majority. With all of this in mind, there should be another layer in place which means the people are focused on the **parliament**. I don't want an American system of government. True legislative power must come from parliament. 

&gt;If the president is impeached, an early election is automatically triggered for BOTH the parliaments and the presidency. 

---------------------------------
How this block interacts with member states. 

&gt;The member states always have the legal right to depart from the union. This decision must be approved by both the parliament of the nation, and a referendum directly from the people. 

&gt;Furthermore, each member state should follow an elective system approved by the EU. FPTP sucks balls. 

&gt;Also, I'd like to see the member states break up into smaller states. The states should have similar populations. The idea behind this is to eliminate German/French/British dominance in the EU, and allow everybody to have equal power.

-----------------------------
United individual unions. 

&gt;There should be loose unions on key issues. I say loose because the EU is diverse, and a one policy to fit all will not always work, but we should certainly collaborate. An energy union for an EU wide network of power. Danish wind power would power Italian homes, French nuclear power would power Polish homes, and Icelandic geothermal power would power British homes. How much power each member would contribute could be mathematically found, from a mixture of population size, economy size, availability of energy sources, etc. An economic union to pool our debts. In exchange, the EU gets a small oversight in the budgets of individual nations. A common border in which every member commits to help tackle illegal immigration from the south and the east. 

-----------------------------
A loose common army. 

&gt; Each member state commits a tenth or optionally more of their manpower and budget to a common military of the union. The states have the right to withdraw their commitment in the event of a declaration of war by a two thirds majority in their individual parliaments. Individual states are encouraged, but not obliged, to commit the rest of their military in a war declared by the EU. However, they are obliged to defend each other if they are attacked.

---------------------------------------
That's about all I can think of. If this system is set up, the EU mandate should be of the people. Again, I am still very undecided if I would like to actually see this happen. ",0,1399245749,null,0,1399246250,0,ch9lzlj,t3_24orrb,t1_ch9lzlj,t3_24orrb,null,1433651765,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

“There is also another strategy, complementary to forgetting. It can be summed up in the words: ‘Still, something was achieved.’ Communism was as it was, but people still worked and created. Such a line of argument — which is indeed true — has the virtue of diverting those who are less skillful in the tricks of dialectic. Any measuring of ‘achievements’ ought to be based on an overall and comparative view. The Danaids, too, worked in their day, perhaps even more than the Romanians. According to this sort of judgement we should appreciate the achievements of Hitler: the greatest motorway network in Europe, the eradication of unemployment... In fact, Romania nowadays is on the margins of Europe from all points of view. While in the West even an isolated house in the mountains will have electricity and running water, in Romania, at the end of intense communist industrialization, hundreds of villages remain without electricity and the network of sewage disposal does not even cover the whole of the capital city. Let no one say this is all just the result of a centuries-old delay. Until a few decades ago there were backward areas — at a similar level to the Romanian villages — in the West too; today they no longer exist. On the eve of the Second World War the ratio of the gross national product per head of population of the most developed countries to that of Romania was no more than three to one. Today, even an estimate of ten to one would be too small. Greece was then at about the same level as Romania; now its performance is several times better. And I have only underlined the strictly material dimension of the problem, which is perhaps less serious than the complete disruption of social structures and mechanisms.”

http://ars.livejournal.com/12135.html

At least since the 1953 Iranian coup black propaganda operations are part of the tool kit of regime changers:

&gt; Another tactic Roosevelt admitted to using was bribing demonstrators into attacking symbols of the Shah, while chanting pro-Mossadegh slogans. As king, the Shah was largely seen as a symbol of Iran at the time by many Iranians and monarchists. Roosevelt declared that the more that these agents showed their hate for the Shah and attacked his symbols, the more it caused regular people to dislike and distrust Mossadegh

Instead of some broken symbols we now have dozens of people burned to death.

*Le viol des femmes, c'est pas bien, et il faut que ça s'arrête*. 

Le message est extrêmement consensuel. Avoir des célébrités qui ""s'engagent"" pour promouvoir un ""message essentiel"" qui me semble relever de la décence humaine la plus élémentaire, je trouve ça un poil condescendant. 

Le clip me dit qu'en tant que personne de sexe masculin, je suis un violeur en puissance, mais que je devrais mettre mes pulsions de violeur de côté, *because I don't want to be a part of the problem, I want to be a part of the solution*.

Au lieu d'un clip éducatif et de sensibilisation à un problème réel, on est à deux doigts d'une vidéo culpabilisante pointant un index accusateur vers ceux qui la regardent: *au fait, j'espère que ça ne t'est jamais arrivé d'assister à un viol et de ne pas le dénoncer, ou même d'avoir blâmé la victime. T'es un type bien, j'espère...*. 

La plus grosse erreur du clip est de s'adresser à des hommes (en tant que coupables potentiels) en mettant en évidence les violences sexuelles que subissent les femmes (en tant qu'éternelles victimes).

Une distribution des rôles assez discutable. On ne devrait jamais sous-estimer le phénomène du viol perpétré sur des hommes, comme le rappelait récemment [un article de *Slate*](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/04/male_rape_in_america_a_new_study_reveals_that_men_are_sexually_assaulted.html) (*Slate.com*, ce coup-ci). Des violences sexuelles perpétrées sur des hommes par des hommes ou des femmes, ça arrive, et les victimes de sexe masculin sont encore moins susceptibles de le signaler que les victimes de sexe féminin. 

Un bref aparté sur les statistiques fournies: rappelons que le terme *sexual assault* désigne aussi bien un viol avec pénétration ou attouchements sexuels que ce que l'on désignerait en France comme du ""harcèlement sexuel"" (*unwanted sexual attention* est considéré comme étant un *sexual assault*).

Au moins, les chiffres fournis ont l'air fiable, corroborés globalement par de nombreux sondages (le problème avec des viols qui sont dramatiquement sous-reportés et donc sous-évalués, c'est que beaucoup n'hésitent pas à gonfler les chiffres en inventant de toutes pièces des statistiques de ""viols non déclarés"").

Sur un simple plan marketing: le slogan *1 is 2 many* n'est peut-être pas aussi malin qu'escompté. La campagne veut faire retenir que *1 in 5 women will be a victim of sexual assault while they are in college* ou que *1 in 9 teen girls will be forced to have sex*, mais il n'y a aucune statistique qui commencerait justement par *1 in 2 women...*.

That said, anti-semitism is quite rare. Even many of the right wing and full blown neo-nazi-parties aren't openly anti-semitic as in other countries. This doesn't really mean that they're not anti-semitic without showing it, but that you can't really expect to get away with it.

Essentially, there's more open hostility towards other ethnic and religious groups.

Many people do have this idea of some kind of Jewish privilege though, that is that they get some bonuses. There's actually a word for that, secondary antisemitism: That is, people accuse Jews of profiting from their oppression.

true,maschlue,NRW,Nordrhein-Westfalen,"Hi, mechanical engineering student here, currently nearly done with my bachelor's degree.

I just completed my internshipt at ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe, so everything I say is from my experience working there and from hearing of former classmates who are done with their degrees.


In regards to your weekly hours, there were 2 different kinds:


Those employed by ""Tarif Vertrag"" (negotiated by a union) or those who are ""Angestellt"" (employed freely). The People who have Tarif Vertrag usually work few hours a week, in the case of ThyssenKrupp it will soon be only 31hrs per week since they are very weak financially at the moment. The usual amount is about 35hrs per week.

I strongly recommend to try to get a ""Tarif Vertrag"" since there is not only fewer hours to work, but much more favorable vacation time and other protections. The unions are very strong in Germany. For mechanical engineering and all steel workers, there is the IG Metall (""IGM"", Industriegewerkschaft Metall, ""industrial union metal""). Maybe check out their webpages for further information. I am sure they would be willing to help you set foot in Germany.



AT (~~""Angestellt""~~ ""außer Tarif"") negotiate their contracts individually and privately with their employer, but they also usually get much more money. Their working hours are usually at least 40hrs per week, it is open ended for higher hierarchy.

The work ethic is very dependent on the employer and the general climate in the office. There are some that are extremely hecitc and effort-driven, others are very laid-back. Usually the Germans want to work efficiently but should not completely exhaust themselves in their job. SHOULD. There are many Germans complaining about burn-out, engineers are sure to be one demographic of that.
Smokers are often regularly found in front of the door for their ""Raucherpause"" (smoker recess (??) ). One can wonder why non-smokers do not get as many recesses.

Coffee drives German engineers. One can say we are machines that convert coffee into ideas. I am quite sure there is no German office without a coffee machine.

How much you get paid compared to the US is dependent on the kind of job, there are many sudies about this, you are likely to be better informed than me if you do a quick google search. You are probably going to get paid more than in the USA, but there is also higher taxes (AFAIK!) and higher living costs, gas prizes for example are much higher.

With a masters degree I expect to have a starting salary of 40.000EUR to 50.000EUR per year, but you have to pay taxes and health insurance. You are likely to keep about 50-60% of that money for rent and other expenses.

A bachelors degree starts anywhere from about 30.000 to 36.000EUR.

Getting a job in Germany will probably be the hardest part in your endeavours. BMWgroup, DLR, Daimler are all very sought-after, usually you only get in by already knowing someone on the inside and being suggested by them. You also have to pass an assessment center, I know of cases where a team leader wanted a certain engineer, but the assessment center said no. So he didn't get the job.

If you want to definitely get a job in a big corporation, you need to practice assessment centers. I'm serious about this.

Knowing the German language will definitely be a factor. You need to be pretty good at it to set foot here, or you are bound to be heavily disadvantaged compared to other applicants. You will probably have a lot of contact with normal industrial workers and older engineers, most of them do not know the specialized words used daily in regards to technical language.

Also, to keep in mind: The english usage of engineer greatly differs from the German usage. In German, ""Ingenieur"" is only someone with a bachelors or Masters degree (new) or Diplom (old). In english, normal metal workers who turn screws and assemble stuff are usually also called engineers, here it is called ""Schlosser"" or ""Mechaniker"" or any of  the many many different types there are. ""Ingeneure"" (=engineers) are always people who studied at a university or Fachhochschule and are usually paid much better and are usually in leading positions.

Healthcare's actually pretty good in the UK so people tend to be happy about the NHS (and much less so about politician's recent hints at turning it into a horrible private system like in the US).

Healthcare in Romania by contrast is in shambles, largely due to doctors leaving the country in droves. People don't trust the doctors much and there's still the whole ""you have to bribe the doctor to get the best treatment"" thing going on which nobody likes but everybody does (or used to, not visited a doctor in Romania in ages).

Libre à toi de me faire dire que le viol, c'est pas grave, et qu'on ne devrait pas autant en parler, parce qu'après tout, c'est un non-problème. Il me semble cependant que ce n'est pas tout à fait ce que j'ai écrit.

Un clip de sensibilisation au viol féminin est-il nécessaire ? Oui, mon capitaine ! Je disais simplement que cette vidéo était un peu maladroite dans son exécution, l'intention étant louable. Mais je n'ai évidemment pas de ""modèle parfait de campagne contre le viol"" à proposer. 

Les commentaires Youtube sont loin d'être des modèles de rationalité et d'intelligence en action, mais lorsque tu jettes un œil aux commentaires de cette vidéo, tu trouves des mots comme *patronizing*, *antagonizing*, ou *ignoring male victims*. Pas sûr que tous ces commentaires émanent de militants *MRA* bas du front.
