Er wohnt in Bochum und hat keine Deutschen Freunde. Der war anfang 20. Der war ganz neugierig. Fand allerdings auch Ehrenmord gut und hat gerade geheiratet... wohl arrangiert. Steht der für alle? Wie viele gute muslimische Freunde hat der normale AfD-Wähler? 

Wie löst man sowas? Wie integriert man diese Leute? Wie kommuniziert man? Hier sehe ich keine Antworten von der AfD. 

Ist der Islam das Problem? Vielleicht halten sich viele Einwanderer am Islam fest, weil er etwas ist was ihnen halt gibt. Gibt es einen gemäßtigten Islam? Ist der Islam strukturell unfähig sich zu wandeln? Die AfD stilisiert das zum Kulturkampf hoch. Wir gegen die. Vom Islam an sich zu sprechen ist ja schon verkürzt. Ich weiß es auch nicht. 

Und ja.. die etablierten Schweigen auf Wahlplakaten dazu. Vielleicht weil sich sie nicht mit einfachen Ressitements hausieren gehen wollen. Weil die Probleme eben teilweise komplex sind. 

Nötig wäre ein Dialog... die AfD will keinen Dialog. Will keine Fragen. Hier hat man schon die Antworten. Das macht es durchaus einfacher.

In my interactions, the average Indian contractor is more interested in just slapping two things together and moving on, nevermind things like software design, architecture and testing. The code quality of a lot of these projects tends to be so bad, it is cheaper to just start over. The culture is all about volume and conning the client that you're working so hard on their project. 

Not so with Romanian developers. The work seems much more thought out and thorough. The developers are actually concerned about the quality of what they are producing and less willing to cut corners at the expense of your project and business. The rates tend to be notably higher, but it is worth paying a little bit more and getting a working IT system, than just getting a cheap pile of crap that sort of does something, some of the time.

To sum up - India: avoid; Romania - go!

&gt;

&gt;__Going postal__, in [American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English) [slang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang), means becoming extremely and uncontrollably angry, often to the point of violence, and usually in a workplace environment.

&gt;The expression derives from a series of incidents from 1983 onward in which [United States Postal Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service) (USPS) workers shot and killed managers, fellow workers, and members of the police or general public in acts of [mass murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_murder). Between 1986 and 1997, more than 40 people were gunned down by [spree killers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spree_killer) in at least 20 incidents of [workplace rage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_rage).

&gt; Iceland is the country, which at young you dream,

&gt; Iceland with glittering northern lights fringe.

&gt; Icelandic is the night of spring,all bright as day,

&gt; Icelandic is the temperament, with prowess courage.

&gt; Icelandic is the quatrain, the Icelandic (atmosphere, tone, character)

&gt; Icelandic is the believe in freedom's spring.

&gt; 
&gt; Iceland is your country, that shall never be forgotten, 

&gt; to Iceland you dedicate strength and work

&gt; Icelandic nation, you are meant to keep,

&gt; Icelandic tongue, the most valuable heritage

true,CyndNinja,POLA,Poland,"It's ""White Russia"", which is actually one of very few names of Slavic countries translated properly in a western.

Belarus is literally something like ""Whiterussia"" in Belarussian, and so it is translated in Slavic languages.

Also some trivia:

""Russia"" in most Slavic languages (Russian included) is pronounced with 'o' instead of 'u' to differentiate it from Rus as a region.

""Ukraine"" means ""Borderlands"" or more literally ""Countryedge""

""Montenegro"" means ""Black Mountain"" in Latin and is translated as ""Black Mountain"" or sometimes something like ""Blackmountain"" in Slavic languages.

Poland's full name in Polish is ""Rzeczpospolita Polska"" which means  ""Commonwealth of Poland"" (or, more literally, ""Polish Commonwealth"") - it is translated as ""Republic"" just to avoid confusion as it is no longer a federation. Also, ""Polska"" which is usually the name of Poland in most Slavic languages is actually not a noun but an adjective (""Polish"") used as noun (yes, same goes for -ski and -cki names, they're adjectives). Finally, ""pole"" means ""field"".

Which can be checked against by being appointed by their legislature instead of a popular vote...but I still back the popular vote idea....and you know...representative democracy is pretty cool....hence why the House of Lords has little authority relative to the Lower House &amp; your Queen is only a figurehead.....

&gt;The Commons are the ones who have pushed Scotland towards independence not the Lords.

And the government is dominated by England because England dominates the Lower House &amp; there is no Upper House with real authority to check that; one that isn't equally representative of all the United Kingdom's constituent states and can properly balance out the more populous states.....

I mean...one of the major issues Scotland has is that England has undue influence &amp; Scotland has too little say...this seems like the perfect fix that would wipe away any say of secession for generations too come....not to mention do the same for Wales &amp; North Ireland....

true,Petros557,GREE,Hellas,"Context: About a year ago, i dont remember on what occurences, the ruling party (ND) asked Tsipras publically about his religious status. Now, his party is a radical left party and you dont become powerful in-party as a religious man, so it is safe to assume that he is an atheist. In Greece people are protective of their religion as a part of the ethnicity (they can get defensive, but they wont provoke anything), so the potential future prime minister CANNOT claim to be atheist publicaly (it would be a political suicide). So what does he do? discreetly and in the party's meetings he is an atheist, BUT he went to mount athos (a very sacred place for the Orthodox Christians) and prayed there and recieved blessing from priests. Fast forward to today, he went to meet the pope (probably it was scheduled since then), as a ""i care about religion"" and to benefit politically from the popes populistic (if i use that word correctly) actions right after he got the title.

MY TAKE ON THIS WHOLE THING: Behind Tsipras, there are two parts.

* the internal party stuff: radical left, fuck the eurozone, fuck the EUnion, fuck NATO, god bless che guevara.

* the people that are assigned to make him votable: we will negotiate (not denounce, as he said 2 years back) the greek debt, we like religion, NATO is essential.

England dominates the Commons by MP count because it is considerably more densely populated than Scotland. Less citizens means less representation. If Scotland was to have a larger representation then they would be disproportionately measured.

That is not the kind of freedom I was referring to. There is very little hidden nationalism going on there, and there is no widespread hostility between the two sides that would indicate nationalist feelings. 

This is Scotland we're talking about, if nationalism and sectarianism still held sway over a lot of people, there would be NO way for the politicians to hide it. There would be blood on the streets, and we would know it.

The freedom that's really at stake here is the freedom from an extremely centralized government and finances, one that Westminster is unlikely to ever relinquish.

A song about cornish miners leaving the county during the collapse of the coal mining industry in search of jobs. Many left in the their twenties and thirties never to return, setting up shop in Canada, south Africa and Australia. Those who did return saw drastic changes in the county, including and not limited to the influx of English over the border and collapse of mining towns and families all over the duchy.

“Cousin Jacks”, as they were known, migrated to various parts of the world in search of a better life.[1] A driving force for some emigrants was the opportunity for skilled miners to find work abroad, later in combination with the decline of the tin and copper mining industries in Cornwall. It is estimated that 250,000 Cornish migrated abroad between 1861 and 1901 and these emigrants included farmers, merchants and tradesmen, but miners made up most of the numbers. There is a saying in Cornwall that ""a mine is a hole anywhere in the world with at least one Cornishman at the bottom of it!""

Because it constitutes a representative democracy? And it's actually have authority &amp; influence to balance out the lower house?

Was würde er denn tun frag ich mich. Hab noch nie eine Lösungsmöglichkeit von ihm gehört.

Ich finde Sanktionen nur logisch, da Russland sich mit Gewalt (Grüne Männchen, Ukrainische Lager übernommen) und unter sehr seltsamen Umständen (Abstimmung innerhalb eines Monats, wie lange und wie sowas gehen sollte, sehen wir bei Schottland) ein Gebiet der Ukraine einverleibt hat. 

Wenn Putin den Zerfall der Sowjetunion schon als größte Geopolitische Katastrophe hält, will ich nicht wissen, wie gerne er sie wieder zurück hätte.

Edit: Und kommt mir nicht mit: Aber die Krim war immer Russisch! Ja, viele Gebiete stehen heute unter anderem Einfluss als früher. Ist noch lange kein Grund, das leben der Menschen dort zu versauen und Krieg zu führen.
Immer wieder wird von Nato-Osterweiterung geredet. Es war aber nun mal nicht die NATO, die die Länder Osteuropas zu sich zog, die kamen aus eigenen Stücken, getrieben von der Angst über die vergangene Sowjetherrschaft. Die Ukraine wurde 2009 übrigens seitens der NATO abgelehnt, so viel zu Kriegstreiber NATO. Zu dem will Putin nicht, dass die Ukraine sich der EU annähert. Putin möchte also einem souveränen Staat etwas verbieten.
Wenn der tolle Gregor mir sagen kann, was wir machen können, dass alle Länder um Russland herum frei sein können, wäre ich ihm sehr dankbar.

Non è possibile preparare un piano per la scissione prima che questa sia effettiva: l'attuale governo devoluto scozzese non avrebbe l'autorità per negoziare accordi a nome del futuro governo sovrano scozzese.

&gt; Tipo mantengono la sterlina, usano la loro moneta o entrano nell'euro?

La promessa e dichiarazione d'intenti dell'SNP, il principale partito indipendentista, è che in caso di vittoria:

- la Scozia manterrà la sterlina in un'unione monetaria con il Regno Unito

- la Scozia rimarrà membro dell'Unione Europa fino al momento di un referendum al riguardo

- la Scozia rimarrà un membro della NATO, anche se l'arsenale nucleare britannico sarà rimosso dalla sua attuale base in Scozia

Da parte loro, i rappresentanti delle controparti hanno dichiarato:

- che il resto del Regno Unito non sarebbe disposto ad avere un'unione monetaria con la Scozia indipendente

- che la Scozia dovrebbe fare domanda d'ingresso nell'Unione Europea come ogni altro paese candidato

- che la Scozia dovrebbe fare domanda d'ingresso nella NATO come ogni altro paese candidato

In pratica gli indipendentisti la stanno vendendo come ""terremo le cose buone del Regno Unito, butteremo via quelle cattive e avremo vantaggi ulteriori tipo tenerci il petrolio"", mentre la realtà è che la Scozia dovrà negoziare e usare la sua forza politica e diplomatica, se ne avrà, per ottenere quello che desidera.",0,1411080147,null,0,false,0,ckm891g,t3_2gsoew,t1_ckm891g,t1_ckm5ji0,null,1426936465,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

Se le cose non son cambiate troppo dai miei tempi, il programma del classico è _notevolmente_ ridotto rispetto a quello dello scientifico (manca in particolare completamente la parte funzioni/limiti/derivate/integrali, che rende l'apprendimento della fisica _diciamo_ un po' piú problematico), quindi dire che lo scientifico è come il classico ma con meno materie umanistiche mi sembra abbastanza riduttivo. C'è meno tempo dedicato alle materie umanistiche e piú tempo dedicato alle materie scientifiche (con argomenti piú ampi e uno studio piú approfondito di quelli comuni —almeno in teoria).

Poi possiamo stare a discutere fino all'eternità di quali cose andrebbero insegnate rispetto a quali altre, ma dire “perché poi servono a chi fa XXX” è un'argomentazione abbastanza debole. Ad esempio, ci sono motivazioni _molto_ piú importanti per studiare le basi della statistica, e non solo al liceo scientifico, tipo il fatto che la statistica è la base di una carrettata di scelte politiche, economiche, sociali. D'altronde, dare un'infarinatura di questa roba significa anche alimentare una generazione di Dunning-Kruger della statistica, e sinceramente non so se sia una buona idea.

Come te penso di essere fortemente radicato nella scienza e nella razionalità, eppure quando a un mio familiare è stata diagnosticata una recidiva di cancro e quando, insistendo, mi hanno detto che non si poteva pensare che a qualche mese di vita, anche io ho voluto provare a guardare anche altrove.

Ti si spalanca un mondo di gente che ti promette e assicura che ci sono mille modi diversi per guarire, che non provare è da stupidi e che è da incoscienti rinunciare. Tu vedi una persona cara soffrire e non vuoi credere che non ci sia niente da fare. A quel punto provi, perché forza di volontà per non farlo non ne hai più e ovunque ti giri trovi gente che ti dice ""se vuoi io conosco una persona..."" o ""ma hai provato X e Y? una mia cugina ha detto che sua zia è guarita in un mese"". Ti sembra quasi di essere imbecille a non provare, codardo e disfattista. Ti senti in colpa perché, alla fine, ti sembra di essere tu a non fare niente per impedire che il tuo familiare muoia.

Io mi son messo a preparare intrugli di aloe ed erbe varie, son perfino tornato in chiesa dopo anni cercando in tutti i modi di trovare anche solo un conforto. Scopri che qualsiasi cosa tu faccia acquista un nuovo senso: stai facendo *qualcosa*! Di sicuro è un aiuto! Di sicuro sarà la spinta in più che manca! E' un'ancora a cui ti attacchi, perché ti senti completamente impotente altrimenti, costretto ad accettare che non c'è un senso o una spiegazione e porca miseria non può essere vero, perché altrimenti non serve a niente alzarsi ogni giorno per fare il conto alla rovescia, per vedere solo una persona che sta sempre peggio. Preparare la pozione magica diventa quasi solo l'unica cosa che valga la pena fare a quel punto: TU non hai perso il controllo, sei ancora al timone.

Io, per fortuna, mi sono fermato all'aloe, l'unica cosa che mi sono consentito di provare visto il basso rischio, ma non ho più alcuna difficoltà a immedesimarmi in quelli che si rivolgono a ogni genere di santone. Se non hai una forte base di cultura e razionalità ci vuole molto poco a lasciare cadere ogni filtro.

Now, after only 15 years and recent global speculation that the euro project itself will crumble, Europeans think that they can make arguments that the United States is somehow fragile and will soon be prone to usurpation. What a lot of Europeans don't seem to realize (or don't *want* to), is that they haven't done enough research, and they don't know what they're talking about. Time after time, I see arguments based on the most thin of sources. I have people in Europe telling me that they think that Russia is the most powerful country in the world - even though the United States spends a little less than half of the equivalent of Russia's nominal GDP on defense every year, for example. Europeans - time and time again - underestimate in so many ways the abilities of the United States, and it seems to me that such opinions are based on nothing except that Bush was an idiot and invaded Iraq. We have so many advantages (for example, size of population, one language throughout all 50 states, relative ease of moving from one part of the US for a job to another) its not even worth mentioning. 

That the 2008 financial crisis has turned into what it is today in the US (unemployment below 7%) is a clear example of this. 

If this sub had more posts sceptical of the US based on solid foundational evidence, than I would be absolutely of another opinion. In the end, the position of the US in the international system will remain as it is currently, at *least* through the end of the century. Here's an example of why:

Whilst everyone is talking about the Scottish referendum, on the other side of Europe, media decided to draw our attention to a 28 years old teacher over internet fame.

&gt; Photo of a beautiful Bulgarian teacher, leading her class of first-grade pupils to their room, stole the show and the hungry eyes of users in the social networks. 


&gt; The image was published in the popular website for funny pictures [9gag](http://9gag.com/gag/aAVdGb2). 


&gt; Because of the great interest to the image, whose description reads: ""Just a first grade teacher at the first day of school in Bulgaria"", the site decided to share it on their page in the social network [Facebook]( https://www.facebook.com/9gag/photos/a.109041001839.105995.21785951839/10152698832101840/?type=1&amp;relevant_count=1). 

&gt; After only 8 hours the image gathered over 230,100 likes, 9822 shares and 7609 comments.


&gt; “I doubt the fathers will not be missing at the parents-teacher meetings”, some of the users commented jokingly.


&gt; “Welcome to Bulgaria”, proudly commented some of our countrymen on the network, while people from all corners of the world explained how they are currently booking their one-way tickets to come live here.


&gt; According to the comments of other users, the father in the background is not taking a picture of his child on its first day of school, rather of the beautiful teacher, because “his POV is perfect”.


&gt; A boy from Kenya thinks the Bulgarian woman is “the natural version of Kim Kardashian”. His opinion quickly gathered followers.


&gt; Others are happy the teacher is not teaching in high school, because nobody would listen to what she’s saying.


&gt; “I want to be a Bulgarian”, one of the most popular comments by men says.


&gt; What about us? We can only rejoice at the fact that there are foreigners who say those words.

Das Ding war doch: keiner hat damit gerechnet, dass Putin so etwas vorhatte. Es wurden die Flughäfen der Ukraine  von hohzeitszeichenlosen Soldaten übernommen (28. Februar). Am 1. März hat das Oberhaus des russischen Parlaments dem Antrag Putins zugestimmt, russische Soldaten in die Ukarine zu schicken, das Argument war: Die Sicherheit der Russen auf der Krim sei in Gefahr (Ab da war dann für den Westen eh alles zu spät, der Drops war sozusagen gelutscht). Am 16. März war dann schon das Referendum.

Welche Sicherheitsinteressen wurden ignoriert?

Natürlich würde ich das. Die paar Milliarden, die da winken sind nichts im Vergleich zu dem, was winken würde, wenn die Ukraine voll in den Welthandel involviert wäre. Schau dir mal an, was mit Polen passiert ist, als die 2004 in die EU kamen. Vielleicht haben die Führer der Ukraine gedacht, ""Mensch, das wär schon was wenn es unserem Land ähnlich gut ginge.""

Here are few points to think about very well:

&gt;While Putin got the balls to play his way in Eastern Europe, Obama doesn't even have the balls to put troops to fight ISIS.

&gt;The Russian military doctrine clearly indicates the use of tactical nuclear weapons as a response to any army deployed against Russian troops.

&gt;If the US interferes directly, China will be free to take over South East Asia, if not the entire Pacific Region, severely over-stretching NATO troops around the globe.

&gt;The Russian people can live on eating just Potatoes; Western people can't live without their iphones.

&gt;The US and NATO military is completely reliant on technology, GPS, and its command &amp; control structures, so if the Russians attacked satellites and the global communication networks, NATO hardware will be just useless junk metal.

&gt;Western Economies are debt-based, just like someone taking a massive loan from the bank, unable to pay it back and claiming to be a billionaire.

&gt;When looking at consumer industries, the West almost doesn't produce anything, they depend on China, India, Brazil, and South Africa (Russia's BRICKS allies), so NATO economies will not survive few hours and markets will crash everywhere.

&gt;Threatening to turn Russia into a nuclear wasteland goes both ways. Don't forget Russia has the largest nuclear stockpile in the world (1st and 2nd strike capabilities)

&gt;The US and NATO has waaaaaay more to lose than Russia. If the Russians don't act now, the next battle will take place in Moscow.

This being said, if Putin decides to invade Eastern Europe tomorrow, the west will have no option but to use diplomacy and to renegotiate a better deal for the Russians. PUTIN knows that well!

But, to answer your question.. Social Security was created in 1934 *so it pre-existed GATS*, and would be likely to be able to avoid the GATS mandate to privatize IF THEY DO NOT OR HAVE NOT CHANGED ANYTHING. But they have and do change things, and that changes everything. if any of Social Security is privatized, [thats it, GATS will destroy it](http://www.citizen.org/documents/SOS-1_SocSec_FINAL_0606.pdf). Thats how GATS and its ilk are designed.  Thats their goal.

As far as GATS is concerned, I think the risk of GATS or some similar FTA eventually being used to tear apart Social Security is almost 100%.

""Er soll gesagt haben"", means ""He supposedly said"", or the more awkward ""He is said to have said"", which English speakers would likely never use due to the repetition of the word ""said"".

true,TelevisionAntichrist,UNSA,Bad since 1776,"First, I don't know why you have to disparage and insult me. 

I didn't necessarily say that *I* thought that the Euro was, at present, in danger of crumbling. I said that people all around the world were wondering if that was going to happen. (during the European economic crisis) My point was that, only 15 years after its introduction, for so many people around the world to be questioning it does not bode well for the ~~someday the euro will be as strong as the dollar or stronger~~ 'the euro will take its place as a reserve currency' argument. 

Just last week, the German party 'Alternative for Germany' got a surprising number of votes. That party is an anti-Euro party. In Germany. And it takes a lot to get Germans to go against the grain. 

You may have the Schengen Agreement, but (and I can't find the source at the moment) only around 1-2% of Europeans currently live in a country other than the one they are from. 

There are other areas of the theory of the ['Optimal Currency Area'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimum_currency_area) that Europe does not quite reach in some respects, and does in other respects. 

When you say 'we', I claim here that you are using that word incorrectly. Sometimes, it seems to me that some EU supporting Europeans start to talk about the European Union as though it is one single country. But each country in the EU is a sovereign nation and has its own national interests. The EU is condemned to have problems getting 28 member states (maybe more in the future) to agree on things - especially the most important things. 

It is somehow misleading to talk about the EU as a single actor. However, the sheer size of the EU market *does* give the EU a lot of power in trade negotiations. For example, in the negotiations on the proposed TTIP. Where it comes to 'power' in a more general sense, though, [the EU is more akin to a small power, i.e. that of Argentina or Sweden.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-5965.2010.02128.x/abstract) 

When you write 

&gt;the EU now accounts for more of the worlds GDP

You make it sound as though that GDP belongs to the EU. It doesn't. It belongs to the individual countries that are members of the EU. The US's GDP - belongs to the US. There's a big difference there, where it comes to, for example, investor confidence. 

In many ways, the European Union's existence in and of itself is controversial, as it must - by its own virtue - step on the toes of a nation's sovereignty. Such a problem doesn't exist for a single country. 

There are many things I'm forgetting or ignoring here. 

Also when you write 

&gt;With more and more globalization it is likely that the EU and the US will be near equal in a few decade and they will both be used as reserve currencies.

Do you have any sources for this? I've never heard that argument being made before.

I even gave a source from which I based my opinion on. The authors of that article wrote

&gt;Indeed, our argument complements economist Barry Eichengreen’s conclusion in his book Exorbitant Privilege that the U.S. dollar will persist as the main global reserve currency due to lack of a fit alternative.

You seem to be arguing against that, but you didn't give any sources for your opinion, and your response added up to - for me - 'Europe as a whole is economically quite strong' instead of 'Europe is so strong the Euro will take its place alongside the dollar as reserve currency'. 

There's just too many problems with the euro, in my opinion, for people to make arguments of where it will be in a few decades. It's probably the number two currency in the world, all things considered, but the differences between the dollar and the euro for me don't add up to concluding what you did. That's why I asked for sources. I've never heard anyone make that argument before.

1. Federalisation of the UK

2. Giving Scotland more powers

3. Westminster concentrating more powers/ status quo.

The first one will require lots of negotiation, its going to be hard and it will be the best-case scenario.

The second one is highly unlikely. MP rebellion en masse is highly probable in case westminster wants to devolve any real powers to scotland.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"The book *Poorly Made in China* was written by a consultant who made his living outsourcing work to China. It seems like a trend in Asia, not just China, to try to cut as many corners as possible without your supplier finding out. 

He cites many examples in his book, but one close to me was Chicago's light rail replacement trains. The same piece for the new cars was manufactured in the US, Germany, and China (to meet an ambitious production schedule). The US and German pieces were fine. The trains started behaving funny, so they removed all the new trains from use until the problem could be found. 

Finally, the x-rayed some of the pieces and noticed the pieces produced in China either had air injected into them to cut back on costs or were negligently manufactured causing them to have air bubbles inside. The brand new cars had to be refurbished. This cost Chicago millions of dollars and lost use of its new cars and it also set back production substantially. Most of Chicago's tracks are elevated and if one of the pieces failed it could have caused the train to fall from the tracks.

&gt;Wie war es denn früher, zur Kleinbauernzeit?
Wie hoch war der Nitratgehalt der Bauern und Dorfbrunnen früher, hinterm Haus die Misthaufen, vorne die Brunnen? Sind die alle an Nitratvergiftung gestorben? Die Kleinbauern hatten früher oft nicht mal eine Jauchegrube, zu teuer, die Jauche floss in den Bach. Unser Kleinbauernhaus war direkt am Bach, da konnten wir mit der damaligen Technik (Jauche Schöpfeimer, unbezahlbarer Beton) keine Grube ausheben, die unter das Grundwasserniveau reichte. Die Kühe und
Schweine pissten mehr oder weniger über die Stallrinne in den Bach. Und die Menschen? Unser Klohäusl stand über dem Bach, da der Misthaufen vor dem Hof an der geschotterten Straße war und man sich nicht so gerne raus aus an die Straße hockte.

In diesem Link sieht man auch das sich die Grundwassersituation bessert aber die EU meint sie würde sich verschlechtern (selektive auswahl der Messstellen).

Finland was lacking in technology in the winter war also. No tanks, no anti-tank weapons, no planes, hell, not even uniforms for everyone. Mostly outdated rifles and machine guns from ww1. I'd say we are better prepared now than we were back then. Even if we are lacking in terms of air forces, we have plenty of things to throw against ground forces, be it tanks, BMP's or infantry. Only thing that worries me is the ridiculous anti-mine convention that was foolishly signed..

Second, the terrain in Finland is mostly dense forest, which renders many modern war machines useless or pins them to choke points, because they have to use roads (tanks, mobile infantry etc). If you add winter to the equation, most fancy electronics won't work anymore, I can tell this from experience.

Third, even if we are a small country in terms of population, we still hold a trained reserve of over 300 000 soldiers (6 to 12 months of training for non-professionals), six times more than for example Ukraine. Considering that you usually need at least thrice the numbers to attack in the woodlands (other things being equal) and probably nine times the numbers to attack in urban area, Russia doesn't have that much of an advantage. Especially when the public opinion (even in Russia, I'd believe) is heavily against using heavy weaponry to bombard cities.

Finland was supposed to fall very quick in the winter war, everyone said that the soldiers are in poor physical condition, they have no weapons, bad spirits because of the civil war etc.. Well, didn't turn out that way. Of course, no one can tell how it would turn out now, and hopefully we will never know, but I'm pretty damn sure Finland wouldn't be overrun in days, weeks, or even months.

Of course, the ethnic cleansing of Serbs on which Bosnia was built and which lasted for centuries — beginning with that during the Ottoman rule to which Muslims were complicit, all the way to the WWII genocide committed by the Croat Ustashe, with some backing of Muslims — doesn't count since the victims were the Serbs and it ""ended"" sixty years ago, even though it didn't and it continued in the Bosnian war, too.

That doesn't count.

The fact that Bosnia separated from Belgrade without it's approval doesn't count, since it fits the pattern of granting the wishes of pro-Westerners when the time comes to decide whether to support ""self-determination"" or ""sovereignty"" side in a conflict.

The fact that it was illegal under the 1974 Constitution doesn't count.

The fact that it went against the wishes of Bosnian Serbs as constitutive group of Bosnia doesn't count, either.

Let's not forget the fact that the Serbs agreed to [Carrington-Cutileiro plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_plans_offered_before_and_during_the_Bosnian_War) in 1992, which was the fairest way to prevent the conflict, dividing Bosnia into three national entities with reasonable autonomy rights within the country. The agreement was signed buy all three sides in the conflict, only to have Izetbegović, Bosniak, withdraw his signature ten days later, the very same day he met with American ambassador to Belgrade. After meeting with Zimmerman, it ""came to him"" that he wanted a unified Bosnia, catapulting the country into war.

That doesn't count, because it doesn't fit the ""Serbs evil, Bosniaks victims"" narrative.

But when acts of ethnic cleansing are committed by the Serbs — mostly years into the war after the Serb Republic is created, and mostly in retribution to similar acts and broken deals — it counts as proof that Serb entity is ""genocidal"".

Regardless of the result I believe this is an example to follow; it could've gone either way, but they, the Scottish, were given the choice. 

I would hope this level of democratic quality could be mimicked in other places, but sadly it won't be. Not only that, but also this victory of the status quo will be used against allowing something similar happening anywhere else.

Anyway, congratulations Scotland for taking part with such overwhelming participation and deciding what you wanted. It's an example for all.

Se ti piace questo POV un po' formalistico allora dovresti anche apprezzare il POV conseguente ""Secondo le norme della mia materia la riposta all'esercizio è 116 Nm, non 126. -4 punti""

Io invece penso che l'Università è l'ultimo posto dove ti è concesso sbagliare senza pagare conseguenze gravi, e che ogni professore, asseme alla sua materia, *dovrebbe* trasmettere anche qualche norma di vita - in questo caso, l'attenzione ai dettagli, nei calcoli, è importante.

Perchè sennò, perché fermarsi all'addizione? Possiamo anche includere le altre tre operazioni, il calcolo delle derivate, il quicksort (""Ma ci mette 12 ore per il sort di 12 numeri"" ""Sì ma solo perchè ho sbagliato a invertire due variabili, cosa che so ovviamente fare""), e in genere tutto quello che non comporta la previa dimostrazione del teorema di Godel.

&gt; Scrivo software critico (fai un errore e le persone muoiono) e almeno 5 o 6 persone controllano ogni riga di codice che scrivo.

E questo mi fa piacere,  ma è più l'eccezione che la regola, come attestano i bugcount di tutti i progetti SW cui ho partecipato (inclusi i miei) e il fatto che ho appena fatto ripartire chrome perché FB lo impalla. E comunque, anche dove c'è un revisore, se ho un programmatore che sbagli il 30% delle cose semplici che fa, dopo un pò lo metto a controllare le checksum dei checkin e la chiusura serale dei servizi igienici.

Ho passato mesi attaccata al telefono, chiamando tutto il globo, mandando cd con immagini diagnostiche e sentendomi dire, invariabilmente, no. Ma un giorno ricevetti l'ultima chiamata di risposta. Era una clinica svizzera, pubblica.

Un neurochirurgo specializzato in quel tipo di tumore mi chiamó, personalmente. Mi spiegó che aveva partecipato agli studi e al trial fatto a Boston: installazione chirurgica di un dispositivo che somministrava la chemio dritta dritta al tumore, la cosa piú estrema mai tentata. Mi spiegó che, invariabilmente, i pazienti duravano un mese, in preda a dolori atroci, senza guarigione e con la vita accorciata.

""In questo momento"" mi disse ""nessuna cura, chirurgica, chemioterapica o radiologica, puó salvarla. Dovete renderle questi ultimi mesi sereni, e possibilmente senza dolore. Lo dica alla sua famiglia. Lo so che é dura, ma dovete essere forti e sereni, per lei. Peró le dico anche una cosa. Noi siamo una clinica pubblica, e non ho alcun interesse a dirle altrimenti. Ci saranno cliniche private che le diranno che possono provare a fare qualcosa. Non gli creda, la prego. Provocherebbero solo sofferenza: andare a stare in un Paese straniero solo per soffrire negli ultimi mesi della propria vita é una crudeltá inutile. E queste persone lo fanno solo per avere i suoi soldi. Non creda a nessuno di quelli che le garantirá guarigione, men che meno a quelli al di fuori della medicina tradizionale. Non ceda alla disperazione: é pieno di gente che si approfitta. Faccia qualunque cosa per migliorare la sua qualitá di vita: medicina, vitamine, regime dietetico, yoga. Ma non paghi nessuno per ""guarirla"", la prego.""

Mi venne da piangere. Questo dottore mi ha chiamato alle 8.45 del mattino, e in un inglese lento, paziente e una voce molto dolce e pacata mi ha nello stesso tempo dato la fine delle speranze e l'ordine di idee per cosa fare nel futuro. Lo ringraziai, moltissimo. Ricordo anche il superneurochirurgo di Milano che disse a mia sorella, che gli aveva portato le cartelle per un consulto, che lui di onorario non ne voleva ""che sulla disgrazie non si puó lucrare"".

Poi, al telefono, perché vivo all'estero, mia mamma mi disse dello sciamano. Implorai lei e le altre mie cugine di dire a mia zia di desistere: con lei potevano parlarne solo in pochi, non voleva sentir nulla da nessuno. Pazientemente, riuscimmo ad insinuare il dubbio. Poi per dire, mia cugina studiava da biologa ed aveva una mente scientifica. Faceva tutto per sua mamma, ma poi ne sghignazzava con le cugine, grazie a Dio. Purtroppo l'ultimo mese non era in grado di opporsi per gli antiepilettici, e agli antidolorifici  non era comunque affezionata, perché diceva che la ""rendevano debole"".

J'ai fini il y a une paire de semaines [Accelerando](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html), un bouquin de SF de Charles Stross. Déjà il est dispo gratuitement sur le site de l'auteur (en VO) donc bon point.

Le bouquin décrit l'évolution vers la [singularité technologique](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularit%C3%A9_technologique). Pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas, c'est le moment où l'intelligence artificielle dépassera (rapidement) celle de l'homme et changera radicalement notre société. 
Il est composé de trois parties décrivant une famille durant l'avant, le pendant et l'après singularité. Il y a tout un tas de concepts sympas comme les [matrioshka brains](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerveau_matriochka) ou le [computronium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computronium#Molecular_nanotechnology). 

Plus on avance dans le bouquin, plus les idées/théories de Stross dérivent dans le bizarre et cela peut rendre la lecture un peu plus difficile si on ne garde pas un esprit clair.

**Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom (Livre)**

La semaine dernière j'ai fini [Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom \(Dans la dèche au royaume enchanté en VF\)](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dans_la_d%C3%A8che_au_royaume_enchant%C3%A9) par Cory Doctorow. Comme pour Accelerando, le bouquin est dispo[ sur le site de l'auteur](http://craphound.com/down/). J'avais commencé à le lire il y a 5 ans et il m'était tombé des mains, tout comme Rapture of the Nerds. Il faut dire que j'ai un a-priori négatif sur Doctorow et ça ne m'avait pas aidé à me motiver pour finir le livre. Bref, cette fois-ci je l'ai terminé. C'est un livre sur la post-scarcity (un peu comme le précédent). Je reste mitigé: l'histoire est passable et l'utilisation des concepts originaux (comme le [whuffie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whuffie) ou les [adhocraties](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhocratie)) ne sont pas utilisés à leur plein potentiel. C'est ce que je reproche souvent à Doctorow: concepts intéressants, histoire médiocre.

true,bilog78,sicilia,,"&gt; Il problema secondo me sta nel fatto che nei licei si continui a considerare cultura solo quella classica

Ma non solo dei licei. Semplificando in maniera molto grossolana, l'idea è che cultura sia ciò che “elèva”, e per forza di cose qualcosa che sia “applicativo” non “eleva” e quindi non è cultura. Da qui la preferenza per letteratura, filosofia, storia, e quella parte di matematica e di fisica che può migliorare la comprensione del mondo, ma che non necessariamente possa ritornare utile in pratica.

Per inciso, anche in un'ottica del genere vi sono delle scelte discutibili: per esempio, mentre nella suddetta ottica il calcolo matriciale difficilmente troverà posto (è fattibile, ma a livelli _molto_ sofisiticati), la mancanza di nozioni di base di statistica è può essere considerata una carenza piú seria (vedi anche mia risposta al da te citato /u/throwaway_veneto).

Vi è anche da dire che a volte le cose nel programma ministeriale ci sono, ma (vuoi per ignoranza dei professori, vuoi per semplici questioni di tempo materiale) non sempre vengono trattate: ad esempio, se non vado errato alcune nozioni di statistica è previsto che vengano fatte già alle medie ora, tipo i concetti di media, mediana, moda, e forse anche qualcosa di probabilità; d'altronde, questo problema affligge i programmi di cultura classica non meno che di quella scientifica.

From what I've studied of the Spanish Constitution the system is screwed up for everyone. There are no real separation of powers, each autonomy teach what they want (which means lots of lies being taught in some places like Catalonia or Basques), lots of money spent on language academies for regional languages, dubbing systems (which implies State money subsidizing the subbing). The Senate doesn't have any real function (literally. They don't have any function or power, they just sit there and receive money while the congress do all the stuff).

The fun part is the Constitution was originally made to be modified in the future because they knew some topics would be big in the future but no one wants to touch it.

I understand why reading this someone would want to leave the country, it's easier but they have exploited the system, the system let them do it, and to me things doesn't seem to be different in the future for them (after seeing how their politicians rule and the debt, they look as Spaniards as Madrid)

Nachdem der Frankreich nicht nennt, spricht er von den Zentraleuropäischen Siegermächten. Klar gehört Frankreich zu der Gruppe nicht zu, aber genau so wenig die Beneluxländer und Skandinavien. Es ist ganz klar dass er die Länder in Europa meint die mit der stärksten Position aus dem kalten Krieg hervorgegangen sind, und dass Frankreich dazu gehört das sollte schonmal jedem klar sein. Aber darum geht's mir garnicht.

&gt; Diese überwiegend protestantischen Länder wurden in gewisser Weise zum Maßstab, nach dem sich die anderen europäischen Länder ausrichten sollten.

Mit diesem Satz will er die Siegermächte als überwiegend protestantisch darstellen um das ganze in eine Linie mit seinem Zentralen Thema, der Einteilung der Welt in religiös definierte Kultukreise, bringen. Er bewegt sich mit dem genannten schon hart an der Grenze der Glaubwürdigkeit, denn mit halb Deutschland und Benelux hat man schon mal an die 50 millionen oder so katholischstämmige Menschen die das Bild stören. Wenn man jetzt Frankreich dazu zählt sind das nochmal 50 Millionen mehr, da ist nicht mehr von ""überwiegend"" zu sprechen.

Es daher entweder so dass das ein Versehen war, und diese Behauptung einfach schlicht ein Fehler war, aber genau so gut kann das auch gezielte Manipulation sein. In beiden Fällen spricht das nicht unbedingt für ihn.

&gt; Aber Religion ist doch nach wie vor fast überall.

Klar stimmt das, unsere Kultur hat sehr viel zu tun mit Religion. Aber das ist ja wohl nicht wie sich unsere Kultur definiert oder? 

Wenn man sich zum Beispiel die Ähnlichkeiten zwischen Spaniern und Italienern anguckt, das ist ja nicht nur gemeinsame Religion, sondern auch eine Sprache die sehr eng verwandt ist sowie geographisch nahe Lage und viel gemeinsame Geschichte. Die Definition eines Kulturkreises der beide Umfasst, aber nicht auch Länder die nun einmal wirklich überhaupt nicht ähnlich sind (Polen z.B.) dann währe ganz offensichtlich ""Mediterran"" oder ""Romanisch"".

&gt; Und wenn du nur die Zeit ""unter den Füßen Moskaus"" nimmst. Ich nehme an du meinst den ehemaligen Ostblock damit. Dann ist das deutlich zu kurz gegriffen.

Hast du überhaupt gelesen? Ich zitiere den Satz nochmal für dich:

&gt; Wie kann man denn einen Artikel über die Kultur im ehemaligen Ostblock schreiben ohne die Zeit unter den Füßen Moskaus mit einzubeziehen?

Aber du hast ja trotzdem richtig geraten, warum setzt du dann ""Ostblock"" mit den gebieten gleich die schon zu Zarenzeiten von Russland beherrscht wurden? Teile Polens und Litauens waren lange Teil von Preußen, und die Balkanstaaten waren für jahrhunderte ne türkische Steuerfarm.

&gt; Die Wurzeln des Konfliktes gehen also schon sehr viel weiter zurück, liegen aber in erster Linie darin, das der Westen der Ukraine christlich und der Osten der Ukraine orthodox ist.

Das ist doch jetzt wirklich totaler Schwachsinn. Orthodoxe Juden oder was? Fast alle Ukrainer sind mitglied einer orthodoxen Kirche oder Atheistisch, Protestanten und Katholiken sind ne absolute Minderheit. Wie kommst du auf so eine Idee? 

edit: Ich bin beim letzten Absatz davon ausgegangen, dass du mit ""Christlich"" protestantisch oder Katholisch meintest, und dass das ein Fehler war - falls nicht, dann klär ich dich halt auf: Orthodoxe Christen sind nach wie vor Christen.

And therefore the Scottish citizens are EU citizens and have been following EU law for decades already.

&gt;The idea that Scotland would get ""continued"" membership to the EU once independent is not only against the current treaties of the EU, but it's an incredibly dangerous precedent

What ""danger""? The Scots have been EU citizens for so long already. Throwing them out and causing a bureaucratic mess and economic disruption, *that* would be dangerously irresponsible.

It's not a backdoor either, because everything will have been negotiated and agreed upon beforehand.

Besides, we've had a much worse precedent in the form of East Germany joining West Germany. Really, do you prefer that a Scottish village declares itself independent pro forma, jumps through the administrative hoops you want them to jump through, and then the rest of Scotland joins them when that's finished?

&gt;a precedent that many countries don't want to see happen. 

Now we're closer to the truth. It's in no way dangerous, it's politically unconvenient for some political parties in some other member states.

&gt;As such the idea of ""continued"" membership would be met with a very brief, but firm veto from several EU members.

true,cbr777,ROMA,Romania,"&gt; And therefore the Scottish citizens are EU citizens and have been following EU law for decades already.

Scots were citizens of the EU only as far as they were citizens of the UK, once that stops being true, so is their EU citizenship.

&gt;What ""danger""? The Scots have been EU citizens for so long already. Throwing them out and causing a bureaucratic mess and economic disruption, that would be dangerously irresponsible.
It's not a backdoor either, because everything will have been negotiated and agreed upon beforehand.

No, it won't be negotiated beforehand, you truly have no fucking clue about international politics do you? The idea that Scotland would negotiate its accession to the EU from within, was a nonstarter as far as any EU member state, only the SNP peddled such blatant lies. That was never true, nor did it have any chance of being true.

&gt;Besides, we've had a much worse precedent in the form of East Germany joining West Germany. Really, do you prefer that a Scottish village declares itself independent pro forma, jumps through the administrative hoops you want them to jump through, and then the rest of Scotland joins them when that's finished?

I think you'll find such an exercise to be anything but a ""pro forma"", like I said you have no fucking clue. Do you actually think an independent Scottish village would be let into the EU and than it would annex the rest of Scotland and tadah! EU membership? Are you out of your fucking mind?

&gt;Now we're closer to the truth. It's in no way dangerous, it's politically unconvenient for some political parties in some other member states.

It's not for political parties, it's dangerous for nation states, the same nation states that you need to convince not to veto you. Such a backdoor of the accession process would simply not be accepted by the other EU members.

&gt;Not at all, since it hinges on the permission and cooperation of the original entity. With that condition diehard unionists can stubbornly keep their regions in their cage for as long as they wish. Until they're fed up enough to be willing to bear a couple years outside the EU, of course.

They can bear as many years outside the EU as they want, who stopped them?

In the US you guys had a great sense of ""national pride"" since you were kids, singing the anthem and the pledge. If you have that in Spain you are going to be called fascist, but you can be proud of being from your town. It's really stupid and it is the product of a Succession War, a Fascist Dictatorship, various brainwashed nationalism and most recently a decentralized education system (I said before, and repeat it. Lots of lies are taught in schools around the country, including Autonomies without a big independent sense but a great nationalist pride).

If you have been in Spain you see there is not a big difference between regions, some are richer than others but overall the people are very similar (of course there are those who think otherwise), like any other country there are big differences between North and South but not really ""different countries"" differences, just ""different climate leads to different life styles""

So, what I am saying is when there are able to show the ""Spanish pride"" (World Cup win, for example). It's a big thing all across the Country but the rest of the time you can't be that way because there is a history with that kind of nationalism.

Und was würde die Nennung Frankreichs in der Aufzählung konkret widerlegen? 

Für mich zählt Frankreich nämlich zu den Ländern die er hier erwähnt: 
&gt;Diese überwiegend protestantischen Länder wurden in gewisser Weise zum Maßstab, nach dem sich die anderen europäischen Länder ausrichten sollten.

Deutschland ist ein gemischtes Land was die Konfessionen angeht, das ist richtig. Aber allgemein sind wir sehr protestantisch geprägt auch wenn uns das vielleicht nicht so sehr bewusst ist. 

&gt;Aber dass daraus die Ansicht entstanden ist in der Bevölkerung, es gäbe nur noch ein kulturelles Europa ist eine blatante Lüge und unbelegbare Behauptung

Meiner Meinung nach verfährst du hier doch genauso wie der von dir kritisierte? Was ist denn an deiner Behauptung, das es eine glatte Lüge ist, belegbar? Vielleicht mag sich jeder der unterschiedlichen Kulturen bewusst sein, aber, zumindest in dem Umfeld in dem ich aufgewachsen bin, neigt man doch eher dazu von oben herab auf die Kulturen im Osten zu blicken, a la: Was der ehemalige Ostblock, haben die da überhaupt schon Straßen!?
Und das ist auch das gefährliche an dieser Siegermentalität, das sich erheben über andere. 

Nun, um bestimmte Dinge greifbar zu machen muss man natürlich vereinfachen. Der Interviewte ist Geschichtsphilosoph, also wird er die Dinge hauptsächlich aus der geschichtlichen Perspektive betrachten, sprich über einen sehr viel längeren Zeitraum. Quasi ein Blick auf das große Ganze. Und da macht es eben sehr viel mehr Sinn die Religion als eine Hauptdefinition der Länder zu nehmen. Da diese eben auch die Mentalität der Länder schon seit Jahrhunderten prägt. Die Kulturkreise werden heutzutage ja auch noch nach den Bruchlinien der jeweiligen Religionen (orthodox, jüdisch, christlich, islamisch) getrennt.

Uno dei principî della meccanica razionale classica è che un sistema di forze applicate ad un punto è equivalente alla sola forza risultante, che è la forza di vettore il risultante dei vettori delle forze del sistema, ed applicata allo stesso punto.

Il punto (eh) è che al di fuori di questo contesto non si può parlare di forza risultante _senza ulteriori condizioni_. Ovvero, se invece di avere un unico punto ho un sistema (discreto o continuo) di punti, e forze applicate ai vari punti, _la_ (forza) risultante (ovvero ciò che determina il moto del sistema di punti) _non necessariamente_ è collegata (in maniera banale) a _il_ risultante (vettore somma dei vettori etc), poiché intervengono anche le relazioni interne tra i punti (es. rigidità del corpo). Però, ad esempio, proprio per il corpo rigido, abbiamo che il moto del suo centro di massa è determinato dal_la_ risultante (ovvero da_l_ risultante dei vettori delle forze, applicato al centro di massa).

Whose growth? That's the point isn't it? Who is 'the economy'? It certainly isn't consumers in these numbers. Who's left? It's a bit deceiving to talk about how great the economy is doing when it only translates to a few people benefiting.

&gt; Ireland needs stead growth to start bringing down unemployment over a couple of years before salaries can then catch up and life the whole county.

Except that this didn't happen in that way anywhere. Wages are stagnant both in the US and in the EU, which is why there are growing battles for minimum wage increases. 80% of the improvements to the economic output have gone to the top of the social classes. Wealth and capital have now not only recovered from the Recession, but they have in many cases surpassed their previous gains. Look at housing prices. Going into a bubble again, which will benefit property developers and landlords. For everyone else it means higher rents, less supply, and higher mortgage payments. This problem is worsened by the deflationary movement happening to the EU as a direct result of its failed Austerity policy. This is nothing more than the chickens coming home to roost in creditor nations from their systemic suppression of demand in debtor nations. 


Stop treating Ireland as if it is a domestic economy like the US; as if it isn't operating a opening economic model. Ireland's strategy for dealing with its economic situation is in spurring FDI and hoping for increased export. Does Ireland get some jobs out of FDI? Sure it gets some. But this isn't really a difficult thing. When consumers start buying again, credit starts flowing again, SMEs start growing and their debt levels stabilise, and in general the economic gains are shared across social and economic strata, THEN we can relax and enjoy it.

There are two major political parties in the Basque Country by public and electoral support; the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) and Bildu; PNV controls the Basque Government, both PNV and Bildu have an overwhelming majority in the Basque Parliament and control up to 95% of the municipalities. The voters of both combined greatly exceed the 50% of the population.

The thing is, while Bildu is openly pro-independence (and so are their voters), PNV is more ambiguous. Some of its supporters are pro-independence and some others just want higher levels of autonomy within Spain; it's difficult to tell what would they vote. What is clear is that both parties would agree in having a referendum; a referendum was proposed by the PNV once in the last decade but rejected by the Spanish Government.

I know that you think that should happen, you don't need to repeat it. The point is: they have been EU citizens for decades, what's the point of throwing them out?

&gt;No, it won't be negotiated beforehand

It's not because you'd prefer that it won't that it actually won't.

&gt;I think you'll find such an exercise to be anything but a ""pro forma"", like I said you have no fucking clue. Do you actually think an independent Scottish village would be let into the EU and than it would annex the rest of Scotland and tadah! EU membership? Are you out of your fucking mind?

According to your narrow legalistic approach, that would be allowed. Obviously it's a ridiculous proposition, but so it throwing out the Scots for no reason.

&gt;It's not for political parties, it's dangerous for nation states, the same nation states that you need to convince not to veto you. Such a backdoor of the accession process would simply not be accepted by the other EU members.

Legally it would be allowed, except for the fact that a scottish village wouldn't be allowed into the EU in the first place. That was my point.

No, you actually didn't. What you said basically ignores all the realpolitik and all the concerns of the nation states involved, by basically saying ""Get the fuck over it"".

Stanco delle ruberie (tutti lì dentro rubavano, per poi rivendere ai privati) se ne va su a Milano e apre ditta. Cerca casa, e si trova parecchie porte chiuse in faccia, molte scuse educate, ma anche qualcuno che tira fuori la solita cazzata del colera.

Riesce a trovare, grazie ad un prete, una sistemazione a **Pieve del Cairo** (in grassetto per farti capire quanto è distante da Milano) in una casetta orribile spersa nella nebbia. Nel frattempo, trova un collaboratore milanese (una brava persona, per confermarti che esistono anche a Milano, città nella quale ho lavorato e anch'io mi sono sempre trovato benissimo) e da lì cavalcano l'onda del boom economico. 

Mio zio ama Napoli, ma, come dice lui, la ama solo da turista, non ci tornerebbe per lavorare, mentre ama Milano per aver dato la possibilità di essersi realizzato, ma di porte in faccia ne ha trovate molte, all'inizio.

&gt; Vote expected on sanctions
&gt;
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee was expected to vote Thursday afternoon on bipartisan legislation that would increase military and non-military assistance to Ukraine as well as impose broad sanctions on Russia’s defence, energy and financial sectors.

The bill passed the committee vote: [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Unanimously Passes Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014](http://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/chair/release/senate-foreign-relations-committee-unanimously-passes-ukraine-freedom-support-act-of-2014)

Excerpts:
&gt; The legislation requires the president to apply sanctions against:  
&gt;
* Rosoboronexport and other Russian defense firms that contribute to instability in Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, and Syria;  
&gt;
* Companies worldwide that make significant investments in particular unconventional Russian crude oil energy projects;
&gt;
* Gazprom, if the President determines that Gazprom is withholding significant natural gas supplies from member countries of NATO or further withholds such supplies from countries such as Ukraine, Georgia, or Moldova. 
&gt;
It also authorizes restrictions on foreign financial institutions’ dealings with the United States banking system if it is determined the financial institution has engaged in significant sanctionable transactions related to Russia’s defense and energy sectors, or significant transactions on behalf of any Russian individual or entity that has been sanctioned in connection with the crisis in Ukraine. 
&gt;
This legislation authorizes the president to provide military assistance to Ukraine, to include:  
Providing defense articles, defense services, and training to the Government of Ukraine for the purpose of countering offensive weapons and reestablishing the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including anti-tank and anti-armor weapons; crew weapons and ammunition; counter-artillery radars to identify and target artillery batteries; fire control, range finder, and optical and guidance and control equipment; tactical troop-operated surveillance drones, and secure command and communications equipment.

Er bewegt sich mit dem genannten schon hart an der Grenze der Glaubwürdigkeit, denn mit halb Deutschland und Benelux hat man schon mal an die 50 millionen oder so katholischstämmige Menschen die das Bild stören. Wenn man jetzt Frankreich dazu zählt sind das nochmal 50 Millionen mehr, da ist nicht mehr von ""überwiegend"" zu sprechen.

Da geht es doch nicht darum wieviele Menschen sich auf amtlichen Zetteln als röhmisch-katholisch oder evangelisch bezeichnen. Es geht um die Mentalität und die geht in diesen Ländern klar in Richtung Protestatismus, auch wenn man das als röhmisch-katholischer nicht unbedingt vermutet. 

&gt;Klar stimmt das, unsere Kultur hat sehr viel zu tun mit Religion. Aber das ist ja wohl nicht wie sich unsere Kultur definiert oder?

Ich würde schon sagen das sich unsere Kultur so definiert. Unser Wertesystem ist klar christlich geprägt. Und das hat Auswirkungen auf alles andere. 

Einen mediterranen oder romanischen Kulturkreis gibt es heutzutage doch gar nicht mehr? Polen ist schon aufgrund seiner Geschichte genauso westlich geprägt wie Spanien oder Italien. Natürlich unterscheidet sich die Sprache deutlich und natürlich gibt es auch kulturelle Unterschiede, aber die Werte die vertreten werden sind eben identisch, sind westlich und somit christlich.

Je passe sur ton jugement de valeur qui n'a aucun intérêt.

&gt;la majorité d'entre eux ont une double nationalité

Et il n'y a aucune raison qu'ils préfèrent leur autre nationalité à la française à priori. S'ils préfèrent leur autre nationalité, il n'y a aucune raison pour qu'ils restent français.

&gt;Une écrasante majorité de ses 42% sont sois en Amérique ou dans d'autres pays de l'Union

Et donc des pays avec lesquels on peut facilement avoir des accords de double nationalité. La double nationalité doit se faire entre deux pays avec des accords bilatéraux.

&gt;Des pays vitaux pour le transfert de technologie, d'argent et de compétence surtout les USA

Quel est le rapport avec la double nationalité ?

Un Français ne peut pas faire de transfert s'il n'a pas la double nationalité ? Les doubles nationaux sont des surhommes ?

&gt;La double nationalité est un instrument puissant 

Non. Tu ne fais qu'affirmer à partir de préjugés. Le nombre de double nationaux a augmenté sans aucune incidence sur la place de la France dans le monde. Et tu fais exprès de refuser de voir le problème des doubles nationalités là où il est le plus important : sur le territoire français.

&gt;A remittance is a transfer of money by a foreign worker **to an individual in his or her home country et non a un gouvernement

OK tu as raison, du coup j'ai été regarder comment la banque mondiale comptait :

Migrant remittances are defined as the sum of workers’ remittances, compensation 
of employees, and migrants’ transfers.

Sur les 16 milliards de ""remittance"" en 2009, tu en avais 14,5 milliards qui concernaient les ""compensations of employees"".

http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAC/Resources/Factbook2011-Ebook.pdf

Quand tu regardes les flux tu  ça concerne principalement les transfrontaliers et ceux qui bossent pour des boites françaises... [Plus de 12 milliards rien que pour la Suisse](http://www.bilan.ch/thierry-boitelle/questions-fiscales/france-suisse-les-milliards-des-frontaliers-1ere-partie), [plus de 3 milliards venant du Luxembourg](http://www.lessentiel.lu/news/story/11522330)...

Ça n'a donc strictement rien à voir avec la double nationalité ou avec une quelconque générosité des expatriés. Bien tenté cela dit, j'ai dû aller regarder en détail pour vérifier ça m'a pris du temps.

&gt;Mais 21 millards qui rentre et 24 millards pour les prévisions de l'année prochaine c'est la France qui gagne dans ce cas et le chiffre ne cesse d'etre en constante progression

They are merely influenced by political debates and what **sounds** more correct to them at the time, which only really depends on how good the politicians are at framing the debate to their advantage. 

It's like how the US politicians managed to convince people that ""socialism is unsustainable in the long term"", for example. That's not based in realism - it's based on politicians (or ideologists) defining and framing a version of reality for their voters to simply adopt.

Voting on economic issues is not voting with your head, unless you have a relevant education and a degree. It's voting for what a politician told you is smarter, out of the fear of not doing something stupid. It's the foundation of conservative political philosophy - ""keep things as they are, because at least we know what that's like"".

true,my_baby_ate_dingos,IDF,Ile-de-France,"Allez, je balance quelques séries de bouquins fantasy/sci-fi connues, mais pas trop :D

Commençons par un excellent auteur: **Garth Nix**. J'ai lu deux séries de lui, *Keys to the Kingdom* et *The Old Kingdom*, qui malgré le mot ""kingdom"" ne sont pas du tout la même chose.

Dans *Keys to the Kingdom*, le multivers est gouverné par The House, une dimension divisée en sept Domaines où s'affairent des créatures immortelles (et souvent un peu bébêtes) qui administrent les différents asects du multivers. L'Architecte, la créatrice de tout, à construit le Multivers à partir du Rien primordial, puis à créé The House pour l'administrer, avant de disparaître et de laisser son Testament à sept ""Trustees"", chacun possédant un Domaine, une partie de son Testament, et une Clé qui leur donne le pouvoir. Les Trustees ont depuis longtemps trahi la volonté du Testament, et c'est malheureusement un pauvre gamin asthmatique, Arthur Penhaligon, que le sort choisit pour reprendre le contrôle de The House et de l'univers, rien que ça.

* Keys to the Kingdom, Garth Nix, sept bouquins: Mister Monday, Grim Tuesday, Drowned Wednesday, Sir Thursday, Lady Friday, Superior Saturday, Lord Sunday.

Dans *The Old Kingdom*, beaucoup plus sombre que l'autre série, il existe deux grands royaumes: Ancelstierre, ressemblant à l'Europe des années 1920, et le Vieux Royaume, un pays de magie ou la technologie ne fonctionne pas, séparé d'Ancelstierre par un Mur magique. La Magie du Vieux Royaume est divisée en deux grands domaines: la magie de la Charte, régulée et limitée dans ses pouvoirs et accessibles à tous, et la Magie Libre, puissante et terrifiante, dont le plus terrible pouvoir est celui de plonger dans la Mort pour en ressortir des âmes mortes pour les contrôler. Pour combattre ces Nécromanciens, c'est aux Abhorsens, des puissants magiciens qui plongent dans la Mort pour neutraliser les Morts-Vivants, de protéger le Royaume et son Roi. Mais quel Roi? Cela fait plusieurs centaines d'années qu'il n'y a plus de Roi dans le Royaume, plus de pouvoir, et les Morts-Vivants sont libres d'agir. Il faut un nouvel Abhorsen pour rétablir l'ordre, et c'est Sabriel, une adolescente née dans le Royaume et éduquée en Ancelstierre, qui va reprendre le flambeau.

* The Old Kingdom, Garth Nix, trois bouquins: Sabriel, Lirael, Abhorsen, et un recueil de nouvelles, Across the Wall.

A cela, je vais rajouter les **Dresden Files** de Jim Butcher. C'est assez connuaux US, mais je n'en vois pas trop en France. Il y a beaucoup trop de bouquins pour en parler tous, mais si vous aimez l'urban fantasy et n'avez jamais lu les Dresden Files, votre vie n'est pas complète.

Et enfin, la série des **Repairman Jack** de F. Scott Wilkinson. Jack est un  porte-flingue à gages très connu, qui s'occupe de récupérer des objets volés, de faire peur à certaines personnes, mais qui n'a jamais assassiné personne. Au début de la série, sa réputation commence à le précéder, et il attire l'attention de forces trop anciennes pour lui. Je n'ai encore lu que les deux premiers bouquins, *The Tomb* et *Legacies*, qui jouent avec la ligne entre science-fiction et urban fantasy, entre monstres et technologie, avec Repairman Jack, ses réflèxes et son bon vieux Beretta au milieu.",0,1411121442,null,0,false,0,ckmmosb,t3_2gua7b,t1_ckmmosb,t3_2gua7b,null,1426927238,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

true,Parabellum8g,NETH,Indifference is the best kind of tolerance (/s),"Interesting story. What you say almost complete applies to the status of Muslims in the Netherlands as well. Everyone can make the best of their life, given the fact that the government will provide them with the tools to do so. And I believe Germany and the Netherlands are far from exceptions with respect to other European nations.

As for the situation over here: a major influence in the fact that Muslims as group - though I'd rather not speak of a group in this regard - are being left behind a bit is also the fact they tend to strongly identify as being part of a group. This has resulted in all kinds of awkwardness, including forming an own parallel community within society. Things like mastery of the native language and integration within society have been partially thwarted because of this. Though there have been more factors, including the failure of national governments all across Europe to adress even the most basic of problems. But I have named this one in particular as there isn't enough attention to this problem anywhere in Europe.

I also immediatly recognize the urge to blame other non-Muslims for a racist attitude. First of all, racism of course is the **wrong word** to describe it. Muslims don't belong to a race, but rather to a certain religious faith to which they identify. So if we're talking about any alleged bad treatment, we should be talking about the scourge of discrimination. 

What next to that catches my eye is that you - even though you identify as being agnostic - still identify as being a muslim. Of course that's part of being agnostic (since you don't know what to pick) but still it's a kind of contradiction.  Though you're completely free to do that.

I wouldn't say that's the case here. Basically, what you stated was that ""Hausen"" means ""housing"", but that gives a false impression. You're correct when you say that what it really means is ""settlement"", but that's not what ""housing"" means. A settlement is a place where there are permanent dwellings; housing is the walls and roofs that constitute a permanent dwelling. The problem is that the shift of meaning is *so* subtle that it's likely to be missed; it's still a very important shift, though, so needs to be pointed out.

They are giving equipment and training to Ukraine, but anything else would just provoke Putin to destabilise Ukraine further.

Es geht um die Mentalität und die geht in diesen Ländern klar in Richtung Protestatismus, auch wenn man das als röhmisch-katholischer nicht unbedingt vermutet.

Wenn das so ist, warum spricht man dann von protestantischer Mentalität? Das ist doch ein perfektes Beispiel dafür dass diese Art von Mentalität religionsunabhängig ist.

Dazu kommt ja, dass nicht alles was uns ""Zentraleuropäer plus Frankreich, Benelux und Skandinavien"" so beeinflusst protestantische Wurzeln hat. Die revolutionären Franzosen und Napoleon sind unglaublich wichtig für unsere kulturelle Identität, und die waren nun einmal fast ausnahmslos katholisch geprägt.

Es ist insgesamt zwar nicht zu verläugnen dass die Reformation und die in deren Kielwasser populär gewordenen Ideen wichtig für uns sind, aber ich würde nicht sagen dass sie das sind was uns definiert. Das ist der springende punkt - zu sagen dass ich als Deutscher schlicht ein Vertreter ""protestantischer Kultur"" bin ist eine wahnsinnige Übersimplifizierung, die meiner Meinung nach nur benutzt werden kann wenn man andere Einflüsse sinnvoll erfasst und eliminiert. Der Autor hat sie einfach ignoriert, das ist mein Problem damit.

&gt; Ich würde schon sagen das sich unsere Kultur so definiert. Unser Wertesystem ist klar christlich geprägt. Und das hat Auswirkungen auf alles andere.

Jetzt ruderst du zurück. Auf einmal sind wir christlich geprägt, nicht mehr katholisch, protestantisch oder orthodox? Das ist es wovon der Author spricht, und ich denke wir sollten dabei bleiben. Ob du recht hast oder nicht, ob absichtlich oder nicht, ein derartiges Ablenkungsmanöver ist schlechter Stil, deswegen werde ich darauf nicht weiter eingehen.

&gt; Einen mediterranen oder romanischen Kulturkreis gibt es heutzutage doch gar nicht mehr? Polen ist schon aufgrund seiner Geschichte genauso westlich geprägt wie Spanien oder Italien. Natürlich unterscheidet sich die Sprache deutlich und natürlich gibt es auch kulturelle Unterschiede, aber die Werte die vertreten werden sind eben identisch, sind westlich und somit christlich.

Jetzt sind wir nicht mehr nur alle christlich, sondern alle westlich... huch? Was ist denn da los? Selbes wie beim vorigen Absatz gilt; ich werde nicht auf Dinge eingehen die Außerhalb dessen sind was im Artikel angesprochen wurde, da sich meine Kritik ausschließlich daran orientiert. Das gilt auch für die religiöse Situation in der Ukraine, die in dieser Darstellung schlicht dem Orthodoxen Kulturkreis angehört.

These are the most important things for me. 

However I also personally know Muslims who witnessed both physical attacks in public and discrimination at work but I still believe Europe is full of opportunities for those, who really try to educate themselves. I studied my ass off for 15 months at different language courses in Finland and passed the language exam for the citizenship. It wasn't too hard to find a job after that. For sure my university degree has also helped me in this process but my other Muslim friends, who lack a university degree also got different jobs after finishing a vocational school/course in Finland.

Now I've got a stable job, I'm minding my own business and ignoring occasional xenophobics. I advise other non-European immigrants and Muslims to do the same thing in Europe.

- Actuellement, les autoroutes sont dimensionnées en prenant en compte leur aspect payant. On sait prévoir le trafic supplémentaire en cas de gratuité, et adapter le nombre de voies quand nécessaire.

- Un péage est une structure très couteuse qui sert uniquement à transmettre de l'argent d'une poche à l'autre. En plus d'être un boulet pour la société, il limite de fait le nombre d'entrées/sorties, ce qui nuit à la fluidité du traffic, et rallonge le trajet de qui veut prendre l'autoroute (écologie ?).

Enfin, pour l'aspect financier et écologique, rien ne justifie une différence entre le réseau secondaire ""gratuit"" et les autoroutes payantes. Au contraire, ça introduit des distorsions complètement absurdes. Les péages punissent les camions qui prennent les routes les plus courtes, les plus sures et où ils consomment le moins.

Les régions et pays où les autoroutes sont gratuites se portent très bien. Des autoroutes au juste cout (pas de péages à construire et entretenir, pas d'actionnaires à rémunérer à 25%) sont tout à fait réalisables.

true,majambela,ANSY,"Anarchosyndikalismus ","&gt; Wenn das so ist, warum spricht man dann von protestantischer Mentalität? Das ist doch ein perfektes Beispiel dafür dass diese Art von Mentalität religionsunabhängig ist.

Weil der Protestantismus gut zum Kapitalismus passt. Das hat Max Weber schon 1904 in seinem Aufsatz ""Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus"" betrachtet. Und es kann schon gar nicht religionsunabhängig sein wenn die Mentalität aus der Religion entspringt. 

&gt;Die revolutionären Franzosen und Napoleon sind unglaublich wichtig für unsere kulturelle Identität, und die waren nun einmal fast ausnahmslos katholisch geprägt.

Die revolutionären Franzosen waren alles andere als Christenfreundlich, das ging bis hin zur [Entchristianisierung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entchristianisierung).

Und nochmal zur Klarstellung.

Der westliche Kulturkreis ist klar durch das Christentum geprägt. Ob röhmisch-katholisch oder evangelisch ist meistens innerhalb der Länder unterschiedlich, aber letztendlich christlich. Dazu kommt das unsere Kultur auch eine starke protestantische Prägung hat, eben durch die Wirtschaftsform die wir im Westen haben und dem allgemeinen Stellenwert von ""Arbeit"" in unserem Kulturkreis. Die Bruchlinie zu anderen Kulturkreisen, namentlich dem orthodoxen im Osten, zieht sich durch die Ukraine (wie dargelegt ist das geschichtlich bedingt, und wie dargelegt kann man diese Bruchlinie sogar in dem von dir verlinkten Wikipedia Artikel sehen). Die Ukraine gehört nicht einfach schlicht dem orthodoxen Kulturkreis an. Wenn dem so wäre, hätten wir heute nicht diesen Konflikt.

Fruit and vegetables can be eaten raw. Hell you could prepare a salad topped with cherry tomatoes and feta cheese and that'd be less effort than a microwave meal because you don't have to wait for the microwave. 

What's more is a £15 slow cooker really out of the reaches of the poorest in society? I use it a lot as I have a high pressure job also. Once a week I chuck a whole chicken, curry/stew/whatever-seasoning into the slow cooker and come home 12 hours later to an amazing curry that I can then microwave during the week and it'll last for the most of the week also. If I get bored that dish or I want to cook other nights I'll just tuperware it and freeze it so I now have a microwave meal far more heatlhy than what's on offer in the big supermarkets.

Buying fish and chips for dinner all the time is all very well except for the fact you're spending around £6-8 a time for one meal. Slow cooked meals then reheating the meals during the week when you can't be bothered to cook brings your meal cost to perhaps 50p a meal. 

Why is the defacto stance that if you're poor you can't eat healthy when fresh veg and fruit (at least in the UK) is considerably cheaper than any disgusting shite you're going to shovel down your gob and pay a premium for.

I myself am the grandson of an Italian immigrant and I never - ever - encountered discrimination to what extent whatsoever. Next to that I live in a rural, semi-redneck community so that should say something. 
 
What I do have noticed (and really, can you blame would-be employers for this?): if someone gets to a job interview and proves that he just can't speak Dutch to an acceptable level, he's likely to get rejected. That's just how the game plays out, as you need to able to communicate with other people. It is a basic requirement in our society, if not in any society with a dominant culture. 
 
If the tendency of self-segregation as you described would be much lower among the allochtonous population, then why is that I really see so little Moroccans and Turks (for example!) in rural areas? I believe that the myth of 'natives self-segregrating because of prejudices' has been largely debunked a long time ago already. People of Dutch origin just left certain neighbourhoods because of other reasons: rampant crime and other social problems that started to rule these places. 
 
Truth be told: the government should've stepped in back in the 80's and 90's already, by preventing this kind of self-imposed segregation. But I strongly believe in the individual's own responsiblity, and speaking of that, a lot went wrong with the people that came here over the past few decades. We know the results by now. Blanketing those people - and by doing that not solving the problem - is no solution and will only make it worse.

true,crnaruka,SRPS,Republika Srpska," When Republika Srpska will get the chance to organize a referendum for the independence of the repubic, I will not hesitate for one second to vote yes. The biggest reason is that this is simply what the overwhelming majority of people in Republika Srpska want, [up to 90% according to a recent poll](http://www.danas.rs/danasrs/svet/region/za_nezavisnu_rs_88_odsto_gradjana.9.html?news_id=204069).

Rebpulika Srpska is the home to virtually all Serbs currently living within the internationally recognized bounds of Bosnia, and virtually not one of us wants to be part of Bosnia. For starters, Bosnia is simply not a functional state within its current form of government, and prolonging its artificial life only delays the day when a sense of normalcy can return to the region. Moreover, historically speaking, Serbs in the region (who had always until very recently represented the majority of the population) have struggled for five centuries against foreign rule until finally being reunited with all Serbs in what later was called Yugoslavia after WWI.

When upon Yugoslavia's breakup, the Bosnian authorities wanted to break away from Yugoslavia, in a manner that was illegal according the legislation then in place I might add, Serbs refused to go with them. A bloody civil war resulted, at the end of which under the pressure of certain foreign states a political framework was created for Bosnia which basically divided the country in two, a Bosniak (Muslim Bosnian) dominated Federation (with a large Croatian minority) and the [Serb Republic](/r/srpska). It is now clear that this arrangement is not working and that something must change. Since Serbs will never contemplate becoming part of a unitary Bosnian state, a civil divorce is the only way forward in my view that can peacefully end this dark chapter in our history and allow us to live together as good neighbors.

Yes, I'm simply pointing out that the Scots would not have lost EU citizenship.

&gt; There are no provisions for a split of an existing member state in EU law. You cannot hide behind ""it's the law"", because there is no law on this particular case.

The fact that there is no law providing for an EU member state splitting means that international legal norms apply. International law is unambiguous here. The reason why there are no EU laws on this point is because the member states don't want it. The only way to get an EU law on this is to change the treaties. This will never happen because we Brits are going to veto any treaty changes about anything from now on. ;-)

&gt;  and a refusal to accomodate the self-determination of its citizens would be quite antidemocratic.

Nobody is refusing the self-determination of citizens though. Everyone would have recognised Scotland as a new country.

Scotland woulnd't be thrown out. Scotland is not a member state.

&gt; Auf die Frage der Moderatorin, ob die Menschen in Donezk durch die Regierungskräfte aus Kiew befreit werden wollen, antwortete Christian Neef von Vorort: ""Dass sie von den Ukrainern befreit werden wollen, das glaube ich nun nicht, sie haben nach wie vor eine sehr skeptische Haltung gegenüber Kiew."" Im anschließend ausgestrahlten Interview fehlte diese direkte Antwort. Stattdessen sendeten die Tagesthemen ausführlich den Eindruck des Korrespondenten, die lokale Bevölkerung würde die Rebellen weniger unterstützen.

Es ist doch nicht zu viel verlangt zu erklären warum die lokale Bevölkerung auf der Seite Russlands ist? Oder zu erklären welche Rolle der Donbass für die Ukraine spielt. 

Auch ökonomische Probleme kommen viel zu kurz... mit IWF-Krediten, die eine Subventionierung der Gaspreise verbieten und ohne Gas aus Russland wird das für viele Ukrainer ein beschissener Winter werden: http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/09/10/ukraine_cant_afford_the_imfs_shock_therapy

Auch über die ökonomische Line von Poroschenko und dessen innenpolitischen Handeln wird wenig geschrieben. Sowas hier http://www.osce.org/fom/123521 wird überhaupt nicht thematisiert. 

Russland tritt aber zweifelsohne als Aggressor gegen die Ukraine auf. Das wird ja auch richtig kritisiert. 

Aber die internen Probleme der Ukraine werden auch nicht thematisiert. Ist ja nicht so dass das Land noch hinter Russland in Sachen Korruption ist und die Oligarchen an der Macht und das leiden der normalen Bevölkerung darunter wird auch vermutlich unter Poroshenko erstmal weiter gehen. Das dieser einen eigenen Fernsehsender hat und eine ebenfalls zweifelhafte Vergangenheit wird auch nicht thematisiert etc.pp

 Faux. Tant qu'on cantonnera des personnes de ce type dans des contextes sociaux propices à la délinquance il y aura de la délinquance. On va faire une *expérience de pensée* : ton ""raisonnement"" revient à dire qu'un jeune de banlieue d'origine africaine entraîné dans une dynamique de délinquance mais *ayant* (boucle temporelle par la pensée hein, tu captes oui?) grandit dans un milieu socialement favorisé serait malgré tout devenu un délinquant ""racaille"", parce qu'il est d'origine africaine, de culture différente et pauvre à l'arrivée. C'est faire peu de cas des phénomènes d'émulation par exemple, positifs comme négatifs.  

&gt; Ça n'a strictement rien à voir avec de la reproduction sociale. Le facteur le plus important dans la délinquance, ce sont les inégalités de revenus.

 Encore perdu... Ce facteur compte, c'est évident, mais la source que tu utilises pour appuyer ton propos ne dit pas que le facteur *le plus important* sont les inégalités de revenus. Elle ne compare pas cette variable aux autres, et n'inclus pas cette variable dans une quelconque statistique multivariée. Encore une fois tu interprètes mal les documents que tu trouves sur le net. En fin d'article ils précisent pourtant *""mais les données ne permettent pas de mettre à l'épreuve statistiquement cette hypothèse""*, et en plus ils donnent un petit encadré bleu juste en dessous pour t'expliquer des trucs importants en stats comme les *p*-values par exemple. Tu devrais vraiment t'y pencher. Au lieu de ça, ce que tu fais, tu sautes sur un chiffre, typiquement une corrélation que tu ne sais pas interpréter, tu te gardes bien de considérer les conclusions des auteurs, puis tires *ta* conclusion d'ordre causal, celle qui t'arrange, par extrapolation limite divinatoire. Mec, c’est pas sérieux :)  

&gt; Oui, les arguments sont idéologiques et non prouvés alors que l'étude montre bien qu'il n'y a aucun effet sur les résultats et est contradictoire avec les autres études

 Ah, donc tu donnes des sources contradictoires finalement, bin voyons. M’est avis qu’une ligne a disparue de ton petit fichier excel n’est-ce-pas ? Pourtant, ce que tu dis n’est pas vrai : *ces* études disent que l’effet est systématiquement faiblement positif, et sont cumulatifs .. rien à voir avec *aucun effet*. Tu parles bien de nuances non? Il faudrait savoir. De plus tu sembles oublier que l’aspiration première d’un enseignant est de faire progresser ses élèves, et en ce sens un effet même ténu me semble bon à prendre, quitte à passer par une adaptation des méthodes des enseignants: c’est leur taf, ne t’inquiète pas. Ceci couplé au fait qu’il est évident qu’une classe homogène socialement défavorisée nuit aux résultats scolaires.. la conclusion *logique* s’impose d’elle-même. 

&gt; Mais les effets du school mix concernent aussi les aspirations professionnelles et, plus largement, la qualité de l’expérience scolaire

Tu as mal lu la suite. Tu en conclus que l’effet sur les aspirations professionnelles est négatif, alors que c’est bien plus nuancé que ça. D’ailleurs l’auteur conclu par *""toujours est-il que si la mixité sociale est associée à des effets scolaires plutôt positifs, ses effets subjectifs restent plus incertains""*. C’est pourtant clair.. sauf que ça ne va pas dans le sens que tu aimerais lire, alors tu zappes.  La personne qui a écris ça maîtrise ce sujet à l’évidence mieux que toi (et que moi), tu devrais t’en inspirer. 

 &gt; Au contraire, on propose des classes de niveau quelle que soit l'origine, ce qui va arrêter de pénaliser les meilleurs élèves de milieux défavorisés. Là où vous les mélangez avec les nuls de leur milieu afin de les brider. Votre politique de mixité scolaire pénalise avant tout les élèves brillants de classes populaires. Les riches savent très bien échapper à la mixité, les pauvres non. Ce qu'il faut, c'est créer des classes d'élite où les bons élèves pauvres progresseront et où les bons élèves riches ne seront pas pénalisés par les mauvais élèves.

Ah c’est bien, je vois que tu as révisé tes fiches entre temps. Finalement toi et le FN aussi êtes d’accord avec la notion de mixité (hétérogénéité) **sociale** puisque tu proposes de mélanger riches et pauvres, mais avec une composante de niveau. On progresse tu vois ? Avant tu écrivais *""Oui donc ça montre qu'il n'y a aucun avantage à la mixité scolaire""* et *""Il n'y a pas une seule étude française qui montre que la mixité sociale est bénéfique""*… bon bref. Tu t’es à l’évidence mélangé les pinceaux avec les notions d’homogénéité, inhomogénéité sociale et/ou de niveau. A nouveau, relis tes sources et tes fiches de façon moins superficielle.  

Concernant la notion d’homogénéité de *niveau* (transcendant le facteur social donc), je ne suis pas convaincu de sa pertinence non plus. Dans n’importe quelle classe tu trouveras un moins bon (suiveur), et un meilleur (meneur), et ce quelque soit la granulométrie que tu pourrais choisir. A la limite des classes de niveau à l’entrée dans un cycle, avec pour objectif clair de mise à niveau des plus faibles, regroupés dans des effectifs ad-hoc, et temporaires.  

&gt; Je constate que non seulement tu as du mal à comprendre les raisonnements et les nuances, mais en plus tu pètes plus haut que ton cul. 

Tu t’énerves visiblement. C’est plutôt bon signe. Considère que je ""pète plus haut que mon cul"" si ça peut te faire plaisir, pas de problème. Seulement, je n’ai pas de doute quant aux altitudes relatives de nos culs respectifs. Tu passes sans doute pour une lumière au local FN et ça t’est un peu monté à la tête je vois, mais n’oublie jamais : *au royaume des aveugles, les borgnes sont rois*. 

&gt; C'est toujours un régal d'avoir à répondre à ce genre d'adversaires.

C’est normal : tout le monde aime progresser :)

&gt; Oui donc la solution c'est de faire venir toujours plus d'Africains en France tiens, ça va améliorer la situation tellement l'immigration est une chance pour la France /s

N’importe quoi…. 

&gt; La solution c'est d'arrêter les flux entrants et d'intégrer ceux qui sont là. 

La notion de flux est intimement liée à la notion de gradient, ici de richesses. Gradient selon une direction = flux diffusif dans la direction opposée. C’est la [nature]( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1468121805000854) qui veut ça. Laisser crever des migrants à Lampedusa n’étant pas une solution (quoi que pour le FN j’en suis pas certain), clairement, il faut soit faire avec, soit réduire l’écart de richesses.

Concentration is also felt to hamper the social mobility of those with a weak social position and/or low skills, particularly immigrants of non- Western origin. Although these ideas may have some validity in contexts where extremely high levels of social and ethnic segregation exist, they are hardly tested in contexts with more moderate levels of segregation and stronger welfare states.

Prima ancora che all'assistente registrato, porterà problemi agli agenti preposti al controllo al block house (la ""portineria"" presente al cancello dell'istituto), i quali si sarebbero dovuti occupare di impedire l'ingresso del registratore.

true,ypz,TEXT," . ","&gt; zu sagen dass ich als Deutscher schlicht ein Vertreter ""protestantischer Kultur"" bin ist eine wahnsinnige Übersimplifizierung, die meiner Meinung nach nur benutzt werden kann wenn man andere Einflüsse sinnvoll erfasst und eliminiert.

Man sagt aber auch, die Deutschen haben nie ernsthaft eine Revolution versucht, denn sie hatten ja den Luther. Das war quasi eine ""innere Revolution"", das reicht den Deutschen völlig aus.

Zu behaupten, dass sich der Kapitalismus aus dem Protestantismus direkt entwickelt hat, ist vielleicht etwas zu einfach. Wissenschaftlich kann man nur feststellen, dass Individualismus, Handel und Protestantismus gut zusammenpassten und sich gemeinsam entwickelt haben. (Neben Max Weber ist da auch Durkheims Werk über Selbstmord relevant).

Der Protestantismus befördert auf jeden Fall das Freidenkertum, beschleunigt die Säkularisierung und ist für Fortschritt deutlich offener als der Katholizismus. Man kann vielleicht schon soweit gehen und sagen: Protestantisch geprägte Kulturen sind progressiver. Wobei diese Progressivität eben auf Individualismus und Zweckrationalität hinausläuft. Was hier Ursache und was Wirkung ist, darüber kann man streiten.

Ob man die sich daraus entwickelnde Wirtschaftsordnung auch noch als ""protestantisch"" bezeichnen will, oder einfach als westlichen Kapitalismus, darüber kann man sich ebenfalls streiten. Entscheidend ist aber, dass für eine protestantisch geprägte Kultur der kapitalistische Fortschritt etwas natürliches ist, während er auf andere Kulturen wie eine von außen erobernde Kraft wirkt. Man muss sich der protestantischen Kultur gar nicht bewusst sein, um Teil von ihr zu sein; es reicht aus, wenn man geneigt ist, ""selber zu denken"", Traditionen in Frage zu stellen und an den ""Logos""-Gott zu glauben, also an die Wissenschaft. 

Ich bin mir bis heute unsicher, ob die Beschäftigung mit Geschichtsphilosophie, Religionssoziologie und dergleichen nicht dazu führt, dass man (unbewusst) konservativ wird. Man übernimmt auf jeden Fall anachronistische Begriffe und fängt selbst an, ständig über Religion zu reden. Aber immerhin führt die Anstößigkeit dieses Begriffs eher zu Diskussionen als wenn man schlicht von Kultur spricht und nicht mal auffällt, dass man nicht weiss, was man darunter genau versteht. :)

Das ist mir zu einfach. Mit russischer Propaganda und russischen Trollen wird hier irgendwie oft versucht alles zu erklären. Sicherlich spielt Propaganda eine Rolle aber zum einen ist der Osten der Ukraine historisch eher näher mit Russland verbunden: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians_in_Ukraine und zum anderen ist die Region im Donbass angepisst von Kiew: http://www.ukrainiandiaspora.ca/opinion/how-to-save-ukraine-or-why-russia-is-not-the-real-problem.html (original hier: http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141182/keith-darden/how-to-save-ukraine). 

Vor allem der letzte Artikel erklärt ganz gut (siehe die Grafiken) warum die lokalen Bewohner kritisch gegenüber Kiew sind. Das könnte man ja auch in der ARD so erklären. Maidan war eine innenpolitische Machtverschiebung und ein großteil des Ostens fühlt sich nicht mehr repräsentiert.

Peu importe la banir serait completement inutile en France pour les communautés que vous visez notamment  les marocains et certaines communautés arabes . Puisque ses pays ne reconnaissent pas la renonciation de citoyenneté par leurs citoyens et ne seront vraisemblablement pas prêt a négocier leur constitution pour la France. Le même cas est arrivé en arrivé en Allemagne le gouvernement n' a pas eu le choix de reconnaître leur double nationalité.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_nationality_law#Dual_citizenship

Par exemple pour renoncer a sa citoyenneté en Tunisie il faut un décret personnel du président!

L'Allemagne a essayé mais sa a échoué


&gt;Et je le répète, il n'y a aucune raison d'accepter systématiquement et automatiquement la double nationalité avec des pays qui ont des cultures incompatibles avec la notre, où dont les individus ont de fortes chances de finir en prison chez nous.


Je l'ai déja démontré plus haut peu importe les loi voté ses individus auront tout de même la citoyenneté de leurs pays  

Ah alors si je comprends bien la double nationalité pour certains et pas pour d'autres... la tu changes la position de ton parti qui elle était pour la perte de la double nationalité pour tous les pays ou qui ne l'a jamais réfuté.



&gt;Et tu fais exprès de refuser de voir le problème des doubles nationalités là où il est le plus important : sur le territoire français.

1) Je veux savoir en quoi sa cause des problèmes avec des chiffres et des sources.. et non le grabuge qu'on retrouve a chaque coupe du monde 2) J'ai démontré plus haut que visé ses communauté est complètement inutile. Cela impliquerait que le pays d'origine ouvre leurs constitution pour satisfaire les demandes d'un pays étranger



&gt;tu en avais 14,5 milliards qui concernaient les ""compensations of employees"".
http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAC/Resources/Factbook2011-Ebook.pdf

Ah curieux..Tout sa me ramene a ce que tu avais dit précédemment dans ton message précédent

&gt;tu oublies de dire que chaque année ce sont 15 milliards qui partent de France pour l'étranger.

Quand on regarde tes chiffres dans la section outlow on ne voit que ce sont 5 milliards qui partent a chaque année vs 15 milliards qui entre

&gt;Plus de 12 milliards rien que pour la Suisse, plus de 3 milliards venant du Luxembourg...

&gt;D'où viennent ces milliards et où partent-ils ?

Ses chiffres que tu me donnent sont ridicules et dure a avaler regarde les données pour 2012

Il n'y a que 265 millions qui viennent du Luxembourg et 1 milliards qui viennent de Suisse en 2012 si on ajoute la Belgique on a un total de 3 milliards sur 19 milliards  très loin de tes 12 milliards très improbable. Tu peux voir d'ou l'argent vient sur ce lien(clique sur inflow).

&gt;Quand tu regardes les flux tu ça concerne principalement les transfrontaliers et ceux qui bossent pour des boites françaises... 

Sa n'empeche en rien que 1/3 parmi eux en Europe ont une double nationalité francaise dont 63% qui ne travaille pas pour une boite francaise et que  2 millards de dollars viennent des USA ou 2/3 d'entre eux ont la double nationalité et 80% travaille pour une boite américaine.


&gt;La conclusion ne s'appuie sur aucun rapport coûts/bénéfices. Encore une fois du sentimental au lieu du rationnel.

Considérant France reçoit plus d'argent qu'il n'en part que interdire la double nationalité risque majoritairement de pénalisé des citoyens français qui se trouve dans des pays proches ayant la même culture et que les doubles nationalités que vous voulez refusé ou les communautés que vous visez proviennent majoritairement  de pays ou la renonciation est illégal ou pratiquement impossible et que ses pays ont déjà démontré qu'ils ne sont pas prêts a négocier leur constitution pour un pays étranger.

I'm opposed to the CAP, but I don't think we should eg prevent the free flow of goods to France until they stop it.

&gt; You're stalling, you know very well what I mean. But suppose Scotland demands a rebate as long as the nuclear subs they don't want are there, or when the financial sector gets a tax break that benefits London much more than Scotland.

I think if Scotland does not want the nuclear subs there and elects a political party that campaigns to get a rebate in relation to them, then the rest of the UK has to take that extremely seriously. However, ultimately I don't think that the UK would be worth preserving if the Scots have this position. Nuclear weapons are a necessary part of European security and at a time that Russia has annexed Crimea I don't think the rUK (or Europe) can risk Scotland destabilising this. If Scotland's position were to get nuclear subs out of Scotland (I don't think this would ever be their position) I think we'd need to take the subs into England (at massive cost to the rUK tax payer...) and end the union. 

&gt; or when the financial sector gets a tax break that benefits London much more than Scotland

I'm someone that lives in London and is more than happy for some of my taxes to be spent on the deprived parts of Scotland and the other deprived parts of the UK. I do not favour a system that means I have to give more money to Scotland than I have to give to deprived parts of Wales and Northern Ireland. 

&gt; In fact, the rebate takes money out of the pockets of other member states to buy off UK's queasyness.

The CAP takes money from the other member states to buy off French queasyness. Given the way the French are turning to the Front National, have already vetoed the European constitution, are hugely angry at the euro in light of their economy, there is no way that the CAP is going away.

The rebate just makes the UK and France be net contributors to roughly the same amount,",0,1411135605,null,0,false,0,ckmqqf2,t3_2gtye9,t1_ckmqqf2,t1_ckmqbff,null,1426923935,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

You being an asshole does not help anybody, especially those who have eating disorders because of anxiety, and you don't know if their extra weight is because they are lazy or the cause is genetical. Are you just that insecure and being helathy is not enough for you and you need confirmation from others? Being fit does not make you a superior human being, you have some other major flaws to work on.

In any case what he said about acceptance is essentially correct, at least in my own experience, although mine is with Northern Irish rather than Scottish notes.

As a general rule, shops in London would not take them, while there is no problem spending Bank of England notes in either Northern Ireland or Scotland. They may be legal currency, but shops don't have to take them, they are under no obligation, and many shops in England *don't* take them, I've been told ""we don't take any of that funny Irish money"" before.

In most cases this doesn't matter as any shop owner can choose not to do make a sale with someone in the first place, whatever their money, but in the case of a restaurant where you pay after, a restaurant in London would be legally entitled to refuse Scottish or Northern Ireland notes whereas they would *not* be similarly entitled to refuse Bank of England notes. 

You are correct that the Scots don't have their own currency, just their own banknotes, but ""own version of the pound"" could refer to either; in the context of what he was talking about (acceptance of physical currency) it is clearly the banknotes.

The compromise that USA has was what allowed the union to form in the first place instead of being a useless confederation with no power. It is that kind of work around that helps prevent the issues that Scotland has with the UK. In the USA system their minority voice would have a better chance to be heard.

Frankly, everyone in the region has legitimate grievances against their neighbors and their ancestors. Just as Bosniaks are resentful about Serbian crimes committed during the last war, so Serbs in the early 90s still fostered resentment about the genocide carried out against Serbs in Bosnia by Croatian fascists and their Muslim collaborators, which saw hundreds of thousands of Bosnian Serbs killed. Even in this recent war, while I acknowledge there was an asymmetry in the extent of the war crimes that were committed, no side was truly innocent and there's more than enough blame to go all around. 

The point is that there is plenty of cause for self-righteousness on each side, but such attitudes only serve to prolong the mutual resentment and mistrust that continues to separate the three ethnic communities. For this rift to heal, I think it's vital that the uneasy armistice that effectively still looms like a specter over Bosnia must give way to a sustainable settlement that would allow a sense of normalcy to resume and allow the three communities to come together as good neighbors. In light of the socio-political situation that has shaped modern day Bosnia as well as the historical context of the state, it is difficult for me to envision a practical permanent solution other than a civil divorce. The other alternatives are either continuing stagnation and ill-will for the foreseeable future, or worst of all a resumption of hostilities. Both of these choices sound like an utterly horrid fate for the future of Bosnia.

true,Parabellum8g,NETH,Indifference is the best kind of tolerance (/s),"I understand that you can come to that conclusion given the differences between both groups. As for me, I have noticed a slight difference between university students of Dutch origin and those with a non-Western background. 
 
Noam Chomsky - at least I believe it was him - has once proposed the idea that our ability to reason is very closely related to our mastery of language. What might have struck you is that some of them just had a worse mastery of Dutch and possibly English as well, a thing that might have contributed to your overall view on them. At least: I tend to quickly judge a person as being 'less-intelligent' whenever his/her mastery of Dutch seems to be inadequate. 
 
Not to say that you are wrong. You could be right: there are some, and I repeat *some* places in the Netherlands where schools (as a result of social segregration) mostly teach students with a non-Western background. Some of these schools have been subject to media attention because of bad teachers or management. Not rarely did these schools have a religious, Islamic style of teaching.  

As a direct result of decades of cuddling persons that are a bit behind on the social ladder, schools have followed suit by giving a mercy pass on certain subjects. It goes without saying that this only increases the problem, but it is a direct result of the long-standing failure within Dutch society to adress ethnic problems out of fear for allegations of discrimination.  Next to that: brilliant teachers mostly tend to avoid these schools, because they get confronted with students that refuse to respect the teacher's authority or with students that just don't get what they are trying to teach *because* of language deficiencies.  
 
And that's pretty much what it always boils down to: language. The main problem in my eyes remains the fact that many Moroccans for example (just to name a group that is widely being taken as 'problematic') don't speak Dutch as a first language, but rather as a second language outside home. By far not all of them of course, but a significant amount. The lack of mastery of Dutch by the parents are a major contributing factor to this, and so the cycle keeps repeating itself far into the third generation (as we're seeing nowadays). Parents are a major cause in this as well, and they should realise that they have much responsibility in this matter.

If you have faith that you can make it as an independent country - and I do not doubt that you could - then I'll gladly support your cause. But if all you want is to take a piece of land from one country and add it to another, pursuing so-called ""independence"" is pretty dishonest. 

Independence is about the right of a people to govern themselves and be a sovereign nation. It isn't meant to be used as a trick for (technically) stealing territory and re-drawing the borders of existing countries. 

Besides, there's probably hundreds of regions in Europe that feel closer to a neighboring country than the one they ended up in.

Schöne Allgemeinplätze. Hier geht es konkret um die Rolle der ukrainischen Armee und deren Handlungen im eigenen Land. Ich denke die These, dass die Realität des Konflikts von der ARD einseitig positiv für die Ukraine abgebildet wird ist nicht völlig absurd. Man kann auch das Leid der Zivilbevölkerung zeigen - die vielen Kontroversen in diesem Konflikt. 

&gt; Kritik an Kiew, die nachvollziehbar bei so einem Umsturz ist, bedeutet keine Unterstützung der Separatisten, siehe Spiegelartikel. Der Unterschied ist wichtig und wurde auch gemacht.

Steile These. Der Foreign Affairs Artikel, den ich im letzten Kommentar gepostet habe zeigt doch gerade, dass es da eben nicht so einfach ist. Putin hat diese Spannungen ausgenutzt, keine Frage. Aber die Separatismus-Bewegung ist nicht gerade gegen den Willen der Bevölkerung entstanden und zumindest am Beginn war sehr wohl ein großteil der ""Separatisten"" lokale Anwohner. Hier - das ist doch völlig eindeutig: https://news.vice.com/video/russian-roulette-the-invasion-of-ukraine-dispatch-twenty-eight - weitere Videos von Simon zeigen ein ähnliches Bild.. 

Außerdem hat Christian Neef vom Spiegel das Wort ""Putinversteher"" erfunden... unabhängiger Journalismus sieht halt doch irgendwie anders aus. http://www.wienerzeitung.at/meinungen/glossen/658801_Wo-bleibt-die-Faehigkeit-zum-Perspektivenwechsel.html

&gt; Mir ist es lieber, sie bleibt kritisch und recherchiert selber, statt Propaganda wiederzugeben, um ausgeglichen zu sein.

Ja. Ich bin - auch wenn das hier gerade anders erscheinen mag - weiß Gott kein Fan von den Leuten, die RT Propaganda 1:1 in die Kommentare tragen und Putin für den tollsten halten. Und ich find die Berichterstattung der ARD auch nicht so schlecht, wie sie in Foren gemacht wird. Ich bleibe aber dabei, dass die Berichte nicht immer objektiv und tendenziell einseitig sind.

/u/Fibs3n 's claim that it was because of Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany is a gross misrepresentation of the facts. The vote had been scheduled to be held in 1944 already in 1918 after the vote for home rule was passed with over 90% of votes. Everyone knew the referendum would be passed and in fact there were many (both in Iceland but especially in Denmark) who thought we should have waited until the Danish occupation had ended to not kick them when they were down as this was when the ultimate outcome of the war was becoming ever more apparent so if anything that would have caused the number to go lower not higher.

The reason the vote was so overwhelming is because of hundreds of years of Danish mismanagement, trade monopolies, refusal to appoint anyone but Danish nobility that didn't understand a word in Icelandic as the highest authorities in Iceland, meeting peaceful discussion about Iceland's position in the Kingdom with massive warships in Reykjavík harbor and a platoon of Danish soldiers marching throughout the streets, laws about Iceland passed unilaterally in Copenhagen with 0 input from Icelanders, etc. 

Most of this had ended in 1874 and was history in 1944 but the resentment lives on to this day and was very much alive back then.

I'm talking about the savings of depositors being treated differently from the investments of bondholders. This isn't just allowed by EU law, it is positively encouraged in the form of [specific legislation requiring states to guarantee the savings of depositors](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0049&amp;from=EN). No such legislation exists in relation to professional investors who invest in high denomination tradeable securities: indeed, the whole pattern of new legislation is specifically designed to ensure that bondholders have to bail in banks rather than be bailed out by the state. 

&gt; The EU has been a ginormous economic boon for the irish economy. Had Ireland left the EU to fix this .... the damage would have been massively more than it has been.

Ireland is kind of a special weird case! Ireland has done great recently, but it is hard to know if this is because of the EU or not. As mentioned earlier in my original post on this thread, Ireland has a lot going for it that is unconnected to the EU (language, highly educated workforce, good legal system, business-friendly tax system)... What was astonishing about Ireland was that it was relatively slow to boom, when the rest of its anglophone peers succeeded. How well would Ireland be doing if it weren't in the EU? (Ireland's peers: Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand... are all doing great too and they are not in the EU.)

Agreed. So it looks like what matters is economic competence - not the EU.

&gt; Portugal didn't do much better and were hit too hard by the current US generated crisis. 

Once we start talking about the US-generated crisis, I think we start running into problems: it sounds like we are blaming the US for our own problems, which strikes me as crazy-talk. We need to be honest: the US was simply the first place to be hit by the crisis. But the crisis would have happened anyway, even without the US. Portugal's current problems are really nothing to do with the US. 

&gt;  The conomies of Europe will always be moving in different directions from time to time. That is the way the people want it to be. 

Different economies moving in different directions with the same currency but no fiscal transfers? This will not lead to good outcomes.

&gt; But all the signs are that once the EU comes out of this crisis, the worst the world has ever seen, it wil prosper. It has proven itself coprehensively over the last 40 years and will do so again imho.

I disagree with this. The reason Yes couldn't answer them is because the answer people wanted was not attainable. For example, people clearly wanted Sterling, but that was only possible without a currency union. One key reason for this is Sterling has been strong and reliable recently, whereas the alternatives are either risky or expensive (Scottish Pound), or very uncertain (Euro due to the ridiculously long EZ crisis/recovery).

The issue here is the timing of the referendum. It came when the UK was beginning its recovery and the pound regaining strength. The Euro meanwhile has been uncertain and oft criticised. If the referendum was held in five years time with the Euro strong and reliable, or in the early 2000s when the Euro was again strong, then voters may have preferred the Euro, or an independent Scottish pound prior to the Euro after a few years.

Years down the line it may become apparent that Cameron pushed for the referendum to come when it did because it was amidst an environment that favoured the Union.

Io me lo ricordo ancora quando da giovanissimo scriveva sulla rivista musicale Il Mucchio Selvaggio, una quindicina di anni fa o anche più. Tutti i difetti che aveva nello scrivere quand'era poco più che un ragazzo ce li ha ancora tali e quali a 40 anni.  

&gt; ho anche letto un suo libro sul tennis a scrocco in libreria, l'ho trovato piacevole.  

So che scrive con un certo successo anche di vino, ma non ho una conoscenza abbastanza approfondita sull'argomento per capire qual è il suo livello di competenza e se dice cazzate o meno.  

&gt; è peggiorato anche nella scrittura, purtroppo, oltre a sopravvalutarsi come battutista (twitter gli è andato in testa).  

E' solito percorrere ogni volta le vie più facili per arrivare alla risata (risata per modo di dire), tende a usare le stesse formule (paragoni à gogò) e sceglie sempre i bersagli più scontati. Non so poi se ti sei visto alcuni dei monologhi semicomici che fece un paio di anni fa nel programma presentato dalla Mannino su La 7.  

&gt; Ormai i suoi articoli sono tutti uguali (infatti mi piacerebbe vederti fare uno dei tuoi esperimenti con lui) (tra l'altro, dovresti farne più spesso), e alla fine parla solo di se stesso.

E tutte le sue ossessioni che cerca di infilare a forza in ogni articolo che scrive. Seppi, Rosario Dawson, Gaber... e che palle.

Although you're mostly right, I have to mention it's not as easy as buying healthy food. There is often an addiction you have to fight.

That's exactly my point. Using Sterling without a currency union is a blatantly subpar option. The Yes campaign played their currency hand by saying no currency union was a negotiation tactic. If no currency union would've been ok with the electorate (it clearly was not), then Yes would not have had to constantly repeat this statement. You could see it in the second debate because Salmond continuously emphasised ""we can use Sterling"" and constantly over-rided Darling's response of ""not in a currency union"".

&gt; On the other hand, it is a relatively good time to hold a referendum, as the party in power isn't Labour.

I agree with this. Its a mixture of things, Labour not being in power and the apex of Salmond's career and a long and successful SNP government in Holyrood.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"It's very rare for former Westminster heavy weights to do much of anything of political interest after their time in Westminster has ended. I mean, normally UK prime ministers get a default Lordship and spend the rest of their days being quite and enjoying a nice life. Blair and Brown are a bit special, in that Blair went off to start some weird consulting company and become a sort of envoy for the Middle East to an international organisation and Brown decided to remain an MP. Most PMs before that (Major and Thatcher, for instance) became Lords. 

Additionally, most of the MPs who *don't* become PMs often like to stick around in the House of Commons and do their political duties their. Tony Benn is a great example because hs joined in the 1960s and stayed remained an MP (apart from a brief period where he was forced to be a Lord) until he died. Dennis Skinner is the same. I think both of these people also used to have pretty senior ministerial roles, but didn't mind being back bench MPs either.

So if you've had a senior role in the UK government but you want to continue your political career, you're likely to want to continue that career at Westminster as a backbencher or as a Lord. 

**However** the times are very much changing. The Scottish Parliament has only been around for ten years and is attracting a lot of prestige and soon will attract even more power. Additionally, the EU is also looking increasingly enticing to former *even current* heads of government. I mean, Blair actually tried to get Herman Van Rompuy's (soon to be Tusk's) job as the head of the European Council. And Poland's current prime minister has given up his job as PM to become the president of the European Council. Additionally, Van Rompuy was also a former Prime Minister (of Belgium) and the incoming European Commission chief (Junker) is the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg. The soon to be replaced Commission President (Borroso) also used to be Prime Minister of Portugal and IIRC he actually gave up that job (after serving only two years) to become Commission President. 

So there's certainly an appetite among increasingly large and influential European states for their leaders to give up their current jobs in favour of an ostensible 'promotion' to a senior European Union position (Tusk's party [Civic Platform] got a big surge in support when their PM accepted his new role). And this is not strictly limited to continental Europeans. Catherine Ashton was a member of the House of Lords put was appointed by blair to become the European Union's effective foreigner secretary. So I think we could see a lot more senior British politicians, especially next time a Labour (who are significantly more pro-Europe than the Tories) government gets into power. 

However, I think interest in Scotland from politicians who've had a good run in Westminster will be more limited. We will still see more interest in Scotland by influential current politicians, but it wont attract 'experience' politicians in the same way other institutions, like the EU do and do increasingly. But it's a great time to be a live! If only to watch as the nature of the various European democracies evolve and how 'European democracy' and politics at large evolves.

&gt;

&gt;__Dual Format__ is a technique used to allow two completely different systems [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) to reside on the same disk.

&gt;The term was used on the [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) and [Atari ST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST) platform to indicate that the disk could be inserted into either machine and it would still [boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting) and run. The secret behind this lies in a very special layout of the first track of the disk which contained an Amiga and an Atari ST [bootsector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootsector) at the same time by fooling the operating system to think that the track resolved into the format it expected. Only a few games used that technique. Three of them were produced by Eclipse Software Design (Stone Age, [Monster Business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Business) and [Lethal Xcess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_Xcess)). [ST/Amiga Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ST/Amiga_Format) magazine also used the technique for their coverdisks.

&gt;Amiga and [PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible) dual-format games also existed, like the budget version of [Rick Dangerous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Dangerous).

&gt;The game 3D Pool even contained a Tri-format disk, which contained the Amiga, Atari ST and PC versions of the game.

&gt;Most dual and tri-format disks were implemented using technology developed by Rob Northen Computing.

&gt;Recently, ""dual format"" has come to identify software which distributed on a single disk which includes both [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) and [Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Macintosh) versions of its installation program.

Disproportionnée : que 10% de la population paye 70% de l'impôt sur le revenu alors que ces mêmes 10% ne représentent pas du tout 70% des revenus. Une flat tax pour tout le monde est beaucoup plus juste. Cette disproportion est encore plus marquée par le fait qu'elle ne bénéficie bien sûr d'aucune aide soumise à un plafond de ressource. On atteint alors un point ou la solidarité par l'impôt (qui a mon sens n'a pas lieu d'être remise en cause) n'est que de la lutte de classe à la Robin des Bois qui entraîne une remise en cause de l'envie même de participer à cette redistribution de richesse.

&gt; Si c'est un gros montant, c'est absurde, prendre 50 000€ à quelqu'un qui en gagne 150 000, ça va pas l'empêcher de vivre, ni même de vivre très confortablement.

Tu te rends compte de ce que tu dis ? 33% de tes revenus partirait à l'état qui l'utilisera de manière très inefficace, sans pour autant que tu t'attires le moindre bénéfice (ne serait-ce que de la part de la population qui te considère comme un pourri de par ta réussite financière). A côté de ça, 150k annuel correspond à un salaire d'un mec qui en chie, et qui au final n'a pas un train de vie princier. Ça lui fait 6000 euros net après impôt par mois - de quoi louer un 70 m² à Paris pour 2000 euros mensuel. A côté de ça, il y a des vrais riches (&gt; 5M€) qu'on laisse tranquille mais eux par contre ont toujours des moyens de défiscaliser à fond.

&gt; Si c'est une histoire de taux global, alors les plus riches sont très loins d'être ceux qui paient le plus d'impôts, ne serait-ce que par l'impact de la TVA sur les classes moyennes.

Non, les vrais riches payent moins. Ceux qui sont dans la case entre 5% et 20% eux crachent bien au bassinet, pour un taux plus élevé que ceux que tu appelles les classes moyennes.

&gt; Ca me rend toujours fou les gens qui se plaignent de payer 'beaucoup' d'impôt sur le revenu. Ils considèrent ça comme de l'argent perdu, alors qu'ils ont bénéficié pendant toute leur vie de l'infrastructure excellente de la France, de son système de santé, de son système scolaire. C'est vouloir le beurre, l'argent du beurre et le cul de la crémière que d'être outré par l'impôt.

Ton raisonnement me rend fou aussi parce que tu ne te mets en aucun cas à leur place. C'est pas ton cas spécifique, c'est une généralité lors de la création des nouvelles taxes.

Comme tout le monde ils en ont profité, et de la même manière. Par contre, ils ont fait des choix ou ont eu de la chance et aujourd'hui contribue plus que ceux qui n'ont rien foutu. Bien sûr, l'égalité des chances est imparfaite mais croire à l'égalité des efforts est comme croire au père Noel. Pourtant dans les discours médiatiques, on ne retient que la première partie.

&gt; Dans les années 70, les USA avaient un taux d'imposition sur le revenu qui montait à 70%. L'arnaque n'est pas le taux d'imposition aujourd'hui, c'est le fait que les mieux lottis nous fassent croire que ces taux sont inacceptables.

Les taux sont totalement inacceptables à mon sens. Il est hors de question de faire porter la très grande majorité de l'effort à une population aussi limitée. Au contraire, il faudrait taxer (dans les faits, pas en théorie) plus les 0.1% les plus riches et laisser un impôt sur le revenu, même symbolique, pour tout ceux qui travaillent. Il n'est pas imaginable que l'impôt sur le revenu soit payé par une frange si faible de la population (moins de 47% je crois).

De mon côté, je suis partisan du revenu de base élevé en complément du salaire avec flat tax à un taux important et uniquement sur le salaire du travail, suppression de toute niche fiscale et imposition extra-territoriale (similaire aux Etats-Unis). Pour le moment, dans les faits, on a juste un système qui arnaque la population trop riche pour toucher des aides, pas assez riche pour éviter de payer des impôts.",0,1411146592,null,0,false,0,ckmw90t,t3_2gqz8v,t1_ckmw90t,t1_ckmkyvv,null,1426920507,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

Je soutiens ces propos. L'immigration est devenue une invasion de personnes qui ne s'intègrent pas à la communauté nationale.

Tout comme Giscard en 1991 d'ailleurs.

&gt;Le même a balancé ensuite qu' ""Il est urgent de mettre fin à cette immigration de peuplement car à nos portes, au sud de la mediterrannée, 200 millions de musulmans sont une menace sérieuse»

C'est vrai, 200 millions de personnes pauvres, non éduqués et d'une culture différente qu'on laisserait entrer en France, c'est une menace pour notre identité et notre pays. On n'a pas de quoi les accueillir  et pas de travail pour eux.

&gt;Voir dans les autres une menace, dans le musulman un voleur ou un terroriste

Ils ne disent absolument pas que les musulmans sont des voleurs ou des terroristes. Il va falloir arrêter d'inventer n'importe quoi.

&gt;face à une population qui préfère répéter des slogans plutôt que réfléchir par elle-même, ça a le mérite de fonctionner

Les chiffres sont là. Les émeutes sont là. Le bordel qu'on a eu à la dernière coupe du monde l'a rappelé. L'immigration de masse depuis ces pays ne marche pas et ça ne marchera jamais.

&gt;Qui a dit que l’Islam « est en lutte avec la chrétienté » qui, « chez nous en France, est en régression très nette », et est « incompatible à la République » ?

L'islam est prosélyte, c'est un fait. En France, il cherche à convertir ceux qui ont une autre religion, c'est un fait. Il est donc en lutte avec les religions locales.

Un musulman peut parfaitement devenir un citoyen français, mais dans les conditions actuelles d'immigration massive l'islam est communautariste et prosélyte (conquérant selon les mots de JMLP), donc incompatible avec la République.

À la question de savoir si ""l'islam"" est ""compatible avec la République"", Marine Le Pen répond ""oui"", tout en s'inquiétant d'""une montée"" du ""fondamentalisme musulman"".

Je me dis que je vais bien réussir à tenir le coup, et que si ça se trouve, ça va se calmer un peu. Sauf que non, ça ne s'est pas du tout calmé, au bout d'un moment, je n'arrivais plus à tenir en place, l'envie de m'arracher la dent avec une pince ou de me taper la tête contre le mur (pas particulièrement douillet pourtant). 

Du coup, direction les urgences dentaires de la Pitié Salpêtrière. Là, la dentiste me regarde la dent, me dit qu'en effet, c'est bien atteint mais qu'elle ne peut rien y faire, à part me faire une anesthésie locale pour atténuer temporairement la douleur, et me filer une prescription pour des cachets. J'accepte. Donc elle me fait une piqûre. Sauf que l'aiguille de la seringue doit toucher la dent, ou la racine, ou que sais-je. Du coup ça fait bouger la dent et la douleur est encore plus vive. L'anesthésie ne fait aucun effet. Tant pis, je vais dans une pharmacie avec ma prescription, et je prends direct les cachets (je ne sais plus ce que c'était). Ils ne font pas d'effet non plus. Donc je retourne chez moi, avec la même douleur. 

J'ai dû attendre mon rendez-vous quelques jours plus tard pour être enfin soulagé. Si l'anesthésie et les cachets n'ont pas eu l'effet escompté, c'est parce que les vaisseaux sanguins de la dent étaient nécrosés, c'est ce que m'a dit le dentiste. Je parle pas de la douleur que ça m'a provoqué quand il m'a dévitalisé la dent (évidemment, là non plus, l'anesthésie n'a pas fonctionné). Malgré tout, la pire douleur, c'est peut-être celle que j'ai ressenti quand j'ai vu la facture.

Bref, tout ça pour dire que la prochaine fois que j'aurai une rage de dent, je ne sais pas si je me donnerai la peine de me rendre aux urgences dentaires. :)

The EU Drone Club is going to make a drone to match that by 2020, German and French have had trouble building their own domestic drone so they are pooling resources. Greece will be useful since there has been a Drone program since 1978 and have a few Hi-Tech Surveillance drones to bring some Technology to the project.

true,EwanWhoseArmy,ENGL,England,"&gt;Has it? This is hard to know. There are some views that Scotland leaving would have turned the rUK inward looking and less confident for a generation - and therefore less likely to vote for change. Scotland voting for the union is a vote of confidence in the UK as an entity.

Too Early to tell but I doubt it

&gt;Do they? UKIP just won the EU elections... The Conservatives wanta referendum and might campaign to leave. The media will be divided on the question (unlike the media were with Scotland). And we know what currency we will have.

Again the EU hasn't had a chance to give its side of the argument, all we have are a load of 1/2 truths and hot air from Farrage. They are just a protest vote really

&gt;You can see the UK adopting the euro? Really?

Not for a few years but once the economies stabilize then yes I can. I also see the UK joining schengen once the crisis dies down
