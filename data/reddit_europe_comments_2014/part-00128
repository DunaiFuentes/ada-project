The issue I have isn't in fact a purely/mainly economic one, its that the right wing will spin the blame for most of our economic problems of 2008 and post-2008 on leftist economic policy which is quite incorrect. Now I also know that we have a lot of structural problems but it doesn't look like UKIP for example, or FN or Jobbik or whatever have/will be able to fix these things because those parties are predominantly socially conservative and do not have a strong economic background besides making ridiculous promises or mis-attributing economic problems

Also in general I would hate for a further increase in economic disparity underneath yet another set of right-wing administrations. and I have no faith in the right-wing to actually continue efforts at reigning in banks' financial mispractices. Thirdly, although I do understand that liberal economic policies do work, and in some european countries would be helpful what I also understand is that most governments that claim to have liberal economic policies actually end up interfering, either to look good or support key interest groups/corporations/people which ends up ruining the point of having a liberal economic policy in the first place. In southern europe where nepotism and cultural acceptance of corruption is somewhat higher liberal economic policies usually mean that fat money goes to friends and family (eg: construction business in spain, everything in southern italy ahaha, croatia, etc.) Which really doesn't help the economy, and usually the right wing will hide in those countries behind wilful ignorance and overt religiousness.

I simply don't trust governments to legitimately uphold a more laissez-faire doctrine successfully.

Je suis d'accord avec akkes: ""En théorie oui, en pratique c'est à mitiger"". Sorry for switching to English, but a higher education institute in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, conducted a study about 5-10 years ago, during which students sent the exact same CVs to companies advertizing similar positions, but some with Arabic-sounding names and some with Dutch-sounding names. The results were humbling. A fair number of the ""applicants"" with Dutch sounding names were invited for an interview, but practically none of the ones with Arabic-sounding names were.

Sociologist Lieselotte Blommaert conducted doctoral research that involved, among other things, uploading CVs of fictional job applicants with comparable qualifications, but some with ethnic-Dutch sounding names and some with Arabic-sounding names, to online CV databases.

true,martong93,null,null,"&gt; I think the most damning case against stalinism(or whatever you can call the style of the Soviet Republics) is that it made us stupid enough to think that was a good idea.

To be fair, most of the people relevant to late communism politics and activism were of the baby boom generation that happened during and near the end of Stalinism. The previous generation was still relevant, and the baby-boom generation was raised by people with Stalinism era fears and hopes, but Stalinism was already a thing of the past in 89'.

It certainly didn't help that economic understanding was dominated by Reagan/Thatcher/Kohl neoliberalism, which later proved to be disastrous  and very efficient at screeching growth to a halt for developing economies. Communism ended with very bad timing, if only it ended when the Asian tigers started figuring their problems out. 

Hell, if communism never ended, we might have had the double digit growth of China a few years before the Chinese did. Obviously, being European nations and all, the Warsaw pact nations wouldn't have been exactly like what China is today, they were always a few years ahead, but even being like China wouldn't have been so terrible.

If anything, it's the black-and-white one-size-fits-all view of what economic policy ought to be, with no consideration or thought put into history or what problems the population immediately faces, that guaranteed the unsuccessful transition. Public utilities that were functioning perfectly fine were attacked as being communist era and archaic. Utilities that were pretty good at providing social benefit for a cheap price were suddenly made into for-profit institutions, with monopolistic practices to boot!

So what if you sometimes had to wait in line for a lot of things, at least you didn't have to get a second job and could spend time with your family at your weekend house. There was a lot more social safety back then, you can see the lack of that social safety in the disillusionment and desperation present in the politics of former Warsaw pact countries.

Not really that distant past. Look at Brezhnev that literally shat his pants when speaking publiclly. Look at the two other zombies that followed him. It took three senile genseks to realize that perhaps being friends with Comrade Stalin was not the best leadership criterium.

&gt;Hell, if communism never ended, we might have had the double digit growth of China a few years before the Chinese did.

Switching farmers from manual labor to tractors will only get you so far. China is so huge and populated that it can afford doing it twice or thrice.

&gt;Public utilities that were functioning perfectly fine were attacked as being communist era and archaic. Utilities that were pretty good at providing social benefit for a cheap price were suddenly made into for-profit institutions, with monopolistic practices to boot!

True, but they were not always good - to this day no one in Poland will drink tap water, for instance. You are right, of course - cities wanting to privatise power plants is simply baffling to me.

&gt;So what if you sometimes had to wait in line for a lot of things, at least you didn't have to get a second job and could spend time with your family at your weekend house. 

Uhhhh... a lot of people had to take *fucha*, or illegal second jobs for profits. And yes, because you had to wait in line no one could actually do anything. I agree with the lack of social safety though, I've been working on trash contracts *(śmieciówki)* forever, I can't really count on any sensible retirement benefits.

Yet all three places use the US dollar. 20-25% of Puerto Rico's GDP is from federal transfers into its economy. Federal spending in Mississippi is 77% higher than the federal taxes Mississippi pays, whereas New York gets back 21% less than it pays. New Jersey gets back 45% less than it pays in federal taxes in the form of federal spending. Keep in mind, federal income tax is typically the highest tax burden individuals and companies are liable for in the US, so these are significant amounts. 

Although there is one monetary policy because of the shared currency, there is *a lot* of wealth redistribution behind the scenes using a federal fiscal taxation and borrowing framework. It makes it possible for places like Puerto Rico to use the same currency as New York despite a vastly different economy. That is something the Eurozone lacks. Either that, or at least a more universal monetary policy, would go far to help make sharing a currency work a bit more smoothly.

C'est aussi étrange que de vouloir construire des évacuations d'eau puisque chacun sait que la pluie finit toujours par couler vers la mer. Bon, là tu me parles de la concurrence libre et non faussée, une des sous partie du système capitaliste. Je suis d'accord que ça marche bien, *dans certaines conditions*. Comme tous les mécanismes, il a des limites et des contraintes. Il y a des inconvénients qu'il faut prendre en compte. Et ça commence par déjà s'assurer que les conditions de bases: libres et non faussées sont bien respectées. 

A mon sens tu n'est pas en concurrence non faussée quand tu as d'un coté un agent qui a le droit de perdre 10 fois un investissement d'un million d'euros parce que la fortune de papa est là en filet en cas de faillite et celui qui risque les économies de famille et n'a qu'une seule chance de réussir.

C'est un système qui n'a rien de magique et ne résout pas tous les problèmes, voire qui foire complètement dans certain cas. Il est notoire par exemple que pour choisir un standard sur une large zone géographique, la concurrence libre et non faussée est très sous-optimale et mène a des guerres de standard. 

Les monopoles apparaissent spontanément et ne peuvent pas être cassés sans aide de l'état.

Et là, je n'énonce pas des théories marxistes: c'est de la théorie libérale de base. Dire que ces problèmes sont résolues par le marché sans intervention extérieure, c'est un dogme (prouvablement faux) qu'on nomme généralement l'ultralibéralisme. 

&gt; Ensuite je pense que le capitalisme est un des systèmes qui évite le mieux le maintien des aristocraties héréditaires. 

Ca dépend de quoi on parle. Si tu parles d'une véritable économie de marché, avec un état fort qui impose efficacement le respect des règles de concurrence, j'aurais tendance à être d'accord. Si par contre tu parles vraiment du capitalisme, qui est un système plus complet incluant des pratiques notamment de rentes du capital, tu dois m'expliquer comment tu penses pouvoir éviter la concentration du capital qui arrive de façon spontanée. C'est d'ailleurs comme ça que les aristocraties sont apparues en premier lieu: les personnes ayant la jouissance (et donc la propriété) des outils de production (les terres agricoles) ont été en mesure d'augmenter leur richesse et de la protéger au point de rendre officiellement héréditaire l'accession a un statut qui l'était déjà de fait.",0,1399360253,null,0,false,0,chasdep,t3_24pis3,t1_chasdep,t1_charua7,null,1433672070,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

Texas was Mexican territory, but it was barely populated. Since not many Mexicans wanted to move in, they invited American settlers in to claim land and farm. By 1834, these American settlers outnumbered Mexicans nearly 4 to 1. Since these settlers brought slaves with them, they naturally came in to conflict with the Mexican government, which outlawed slavery. 

In 1835, war broke out, and the Texans declared independence. They probably would have lost, but they managed to capture the Mexican president in battle and force him to sign a peace treaty. They applied for US statehood numerous times, but the US continuously refused until 1845, as they didn't want to antagonize Mexico.

This is not true. On March 10, 2014 the de facto Prime Minister of Crimea, Sergei Aksionov, made an unofficial verbal invitation to OSCE to monitor the plebiscite.

The real reason why there were no OSCE observers present was that the West didn't want to give the vote any legitimacy. But there were other observers from all over the world. Some left-wing politicians in Germany got heavily criticized for participating.

This was the time period where the baby-boom generation was still growing up. To them Stalinism is was what 9/11 will be to today's ten year olds. They weren't really politically conscious yet, and they didn't have to scrap out an existence the same way their parents did. Perhaps how people viewed the legacy of Stalin hasn't changed yet, but the politics definitely have.

&gt;Switching farmers from manual labor to tractors will only get you so far. China is so huge and populated that it can afford doing it twice or thrice.

They are a bigger economy, which means that, while they have more wealth, they have more farmers and industry to restructure than we do. What China really did well, however, was protecting their domestic industries from being out-competed. Nowadays, China doesn't need to protect their industries, they're strong enough to be let loose in the open world market.

Different experiences in different countries and by different people. In Hungary, instead of getting second jobs (not that people didn't ever do so), people grew a lot of their food in their back yards. So people did often have another source of income, albeit informally.

I think there are a few reasons for that.

1. A PhD won't nessesarily give you a better/more paying job in the long run.
2. I think the foreign students have something like 1 month of time for finding a job after graduation before their visa expires. So it's for natural reasons easier to do your thesis for a Prof who'll know you personally for the next round of recruitment.

In addition I must admit that the 3rd world students often perform better than we Swedes do, so I don't think its unjustified that the foreigners get the spots.

The game is rigged from the start either way. Even in a totally impartial referendum the vote will most likely be yes since the majority of the peninsula is ethnically Russian anyway. Does that make it any better? Not really, because it screws over the ethnic minorities in the long run.

The only ones who really have to benefit from Russian annexation are those who are ethnically Russian. The Ukrainians and Tatars should have no interest in joining Russia at all. There might be some economic benefits, but Russia also has repressive government with nationalistic tendencies, so the new authorities there will likely discriminate against them as well (or at least heavily favor those who are ethnically Russian). 

On the other hand, if the ethnic Russians remained in Ukraine nothing would really change for the worse. They wouldn't be discriminated against in any meaningful sense, and if the Ukrainian government even gave the slightest hint of threatening them Russia would intervene in at a moment's notice anyway. In other words, the Russian annexation would only *marginally* benefit the ethnic Russians at the expense of all the other ethnic groups living there.

I don't really know from where you got the idea that an observer mission only observes the referendum day. In addition to that OSCE members got kicked out with warning gun shots the previous day (they tried to enter Crimea four consecutive days). I followed the events closely at that time, the self appointed governor knew they won't come to observe, but he said it in order to spin the story. And it obviously fooled you. The referendum at gunpoint would have been declared invalid even if observers were sent at Russia's request. 

By the way, Crimea can't summon OSCE. If the request had come from Russia then it might have been fulfilled. The mission that got turned back at gunpoint was made as a request from Ukraine.

Minimum wages are designed to protect workers at the lowest end of the salary scale.

What it says is that when Crimean residents and ""specialists"" **were surveyed** about the referendum, they thought that the real results of the vote were 50-60% for Russia, with a 30-50% voter participation rate in Crimea. (They also thought that ""an overwhelming majority"" voted for Russia in Sevastopol, which is in Crimea, but is administratively separate, and is home to the Russian Black Sea Fleet, with a voter participation rate of 50-80%.)

So what's wrong with this headline:

1. These aren't ""accidental real results"", this is Crimeans' opinions of what the real results were.

2. It takes the lowest estimate in those opinions.

3. It states the share of all voters who voted for Russia rather than the share of those who actually voted (which is what matters in a vote).

4. It completely forgets Sevastopol in its calculation.

So, what does the Russian Human Rights Council actually say about 15% of Crimean voters? It says that *if you exclude Sevastopol, Crimeans think that the lowest possible percentage of registered voters that went to the polls on the day of the vote and voted to join Russia was 15%*.

P.S. Also, it wasn't a formal poll survey it looks like.

Then the companies turn around and offer a better deal. It is one of the unique advantages of the NHS.

The Tories hate this. They want to see the market operate 'more efficiently' by which they mean return higher profit margins for the big pharmaceutical companies. If the NHS monopoly on the demand for drugs was broken then those companies would indeed make more money. It would however be at the expense of the population.

The wider theory is that these privatisations would grow the market in general so while we pay more for healthcare we'd earn more and thus could afford it.

It's not


There are more then a few inaccuracies in this op/ed let me list a few:

&gt; The website of the “President of Russia’s Council on Civil Society and Human Rights” posted a blog that was quickly taken down as if it were toxic radioactive waste

This is not true. The post is still available in it's original place (http://www.president-sovet.ru/structure/gruppa_po_migratsionnoy_politike/materialy/problemy_zhiteley_kryma.php) 

&gt;According to the Council’s report about the March referendum to annex Crimea, the turnout was a maximum 30%

This is false. according to the report he is citing as source, the turnout was 50%-80% in Sevastopol and 30%-50% in Crimea. 

&gt;And of these, only half voted for annexation – meaning only 15 percent of Crimean citizens voted for annexation.

This is again inaccurate. The report clearly states that in Sevastopol ""overwhelming majority"" voted for the annexation, and in Crimea 50%-60%

Additionally the source says that those numbers are base purely on opinion of citizens and experts which were interviewed by organisation. So it is seems to me that Mr. Gregory gives that report an undue weight.

&gt;No international observers were allowed.

Again, statement is false. UN and OSCE observers were invited but declined. Other non-OSCE and non_UN affiliated international observers were present. (http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/16/ukraine-crisis-crimea-referendum)


Basically all factual statements in this co-ed are false, and go far beyond accidental misinterpretation. I don't have any reason to doubt Mr. Paul Roderick Gregory's expertise in domestic and world economics but his reports on current events in Ukraine is an embarrassment for any publication.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Second Polish Republic was a total catastrophe due to several factors. The quality of life was very low.   

1. Illiteracy, [especially in the minorities](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HistPol-analfabetyzm1931.png). On the bottom - the percent of population that can't read and write.  
It's just not possible to have an advanced, rich society with so many illiterate people.  
Note that this isn't the fault of the government - it's the fault of the former occupants, Russia especially. Great efforts were expanded to improve the situation and it was getting better year by year.  

2. Enormous cost of the army. Poland was spending about half of its entire budget on the army. After all, on the east it bordered with USSR (which started a war in 1919), later on the west with Third Reich, to the south with Czechoslovakia. It's hard to ignore army while having so many enemies. In 1939 they attacked Poland all at the same time (Slovakia in place of Czechoslovakia). The enormous ethnic minorities were the second reason.  

3. [Big, concentrated hostile ethnic minorities](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Poland1937linguistic.jpg). The non-Polish areas were at the same the poorest, especially Ukrainian ones.   
There are two ways to rule big multiethnic countries.  
The first way is to rule with force. Don't allow minorities to vote, don't allow them to use their language in schools, kill political figures.  
The second way is to allow them self determination. Allow them everything, up to autonomy and independence referenda.  
What Poland did was the 'middle way', a result of compromise between people holding those two different views. The result was horrible. You can't kick someone and give him a hand at the same time and expect good results. Economy can't grow in such circumstances.  
The Jews are missing from the map, but they were a problem all the same. A big part of them didn't even speak Polish (they spoke Yiddish).  
Of all these, Ukrainians were the biggest problem. Most aggressive, most uneducated. During the war, they were an enormous help to the Germans (eg. most of the non-German volunteers to the [Dirlewanger's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Dirlewanger) unit were Ukrainians), they also started [killing local Polish and Jewish population on their own](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volhynia_massacre).

Because this includes EZ member nations which have a LOWER debt/GDP ratio than Germany (countries like Finland, Holland, Luxembourg), the fact that these countries pay more for sovereign borrowing than Germany...AND that this difference increased as the ECB and EU institutions did nothing, exactly means that investors are simultaneously selling Finnish, Luxembourgish, and Dutch sovereign debt instruments, while buying German ones, despite that the economic fundamentals don't justify this.

Much the same happened in series of 90's Yugoslav wars. It is conflict of interests, geopolitics and power balance and teritories. It mostly does not matter what the real truth is. At end 150.000 dead and new balance of teritories and influence.

What that particular user wrote in one of comments, that he is fully partial to ukrainian side.  Simple google search on term ""giggster"" gives the confirmation.


One old from Feldmarschall Göring, which is sadly true for Ukraine too.

""Naturally the common people don't want war: Neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, IT IS THE LEADERS of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is TELL THEM THEY ARE BEING ATTACKED, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. IT WORKS THE SAME IN ANY COUNTRY.""

The Cold War was the exception, not the rule. 

The ""West vs. anti-West"" paradigm is a temporary phase that will only last as long as ""the West"" is perceived to be a unified and globally dominant political/ideological force. It also should be noted that there is really no ""BRIC alliance"" in any meaningful sense. India is loosely aligned with Russia, but China isn't. Brazil seems to prefer neutrality. Ultimately, however, the only priority they really have is building up their own political and economic power, and aligning against the West is simply for the purpose of countering Western hegemony.

On that note, there is nothing really novel about Putin's subversive tactics. What surprises the West is the extent to which he can use them, because it is tacitly assumed that the West has a monopoly on ""soft"" power.

**Chi è Yotobi?**
Uno che fa video su Youtube.

**Perchè è famoso?**
Perchè ha fatto quello che fanno il 95% dei Youtuber italiani nostrani: prendere un format famoso in Youtube US\UK e portarlo in Italia ""spacciandolo"" per qualcosa di nuovo e originale.
E visto dagli occhi di un classico utente Italiano che non capisce due parole di inglese è normale che sembri tutto una cosa ""faigaenuova"", quando non lo è.

**Si merita il suo successo?**
Personalmente si, ha avuto la perspicacia di prendere la palla al balzo e lo ritengo un ottimo comunicatore, per quanto possa piacere o no.
E i numeri che fa ne sono la prova.

Detto questo non mi stupisco del massacro che è successo al Napoli Comicon.

A Mantova con molte meno persone si vedeva già che la situazione era precaria: gente in fila 2-3 ore per una foto o un autografo, ragazzini impazziti che urlavano neanche fosse sceso il Cristo, una calca immensa dentro al tendone con gente che sveniva dal caldo ecc ecc

Scene a dir poco preoccupanti che ho visto solo nei filmati dei concerti di Michael Jackson, e che a Napoli si sono moltiplicate per 100.

**Ultima considerazione personale:**
Personalmente non capisco le reazioni della gente davanti a questi youtubers.
Tanto per dirvi [questa è la folla che si è presentata al raduno organizzato da FaviJ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7_9fd0o3A0) , un youtuber di 18 anni diventato famoso filmandosi mentre gioca ai videogiochi (la copia 1:1 di PewDiePie, per chi se ne intende).
Vi sembra normale che esista gente che urla e trasforma in ""idolo delle masse"" un ragazzino che si filma mentre gioca ai videogiochi?

Io personalmente seguo Yotobi, non mi dispiace il lavoro che fa e lo rispetto, ma da qui a mettermi a piangere quando lo vedo ne passa di acqua sotto i ponti...
Avete qualche spiegazione in merito che possa spiegare questo fenomeno?
Sono io troppo vecchio per questo genere di reazioni?

In France leading politicians and CEOs have engineering or business degrees from prestigious schools (X, HEC, Mines etc.), usually at a master's level.

...kidding.

Berlin in the summer is just awesome and the best advice I can give to a young person here for a limited time is to just jump right in and make the most of it. Berlin is a heaven for the young. One day you'll look back and think, ""*dammit, I should have ....*"" So just dont waste any time getting out there, it'll be over before you know it.


Basics:
To give you a perspective: Berlin is split West/East. To the Eastern folks, the West is full of fancy people, expensive shops, tourist and capitalists. To the Westerners, the East is grungy bars, broken glass, cheap apartments, cheaper drugs and dogshit. 

To the southeast you've got Neukoln and to the north, Wedding. Both have a bit of a bad reputation, but to an American, its nothing you cant handle. 

I happen to think Berlin is the single best city Ive ever lived in. Ive been traveling/moving for almost ten years and Ill never leave here.

Learn the different stops, Ubahn lines and keiz around you. ""*Its one stop from Kotti*"". Or ""*Im in Alt Treptow*"". 


Fun stuff:
Berlin is huge. Massive, there are a million awesome areas. Freidrichshain and Xberg are where all the cool parties and stuff are. Cheap beer, cheap food, lots of pubs and artsy shit. Hang out around Simon Dachstrasse, Gorlitzer Park, Kottbusser Tor.....but really, you can find something cool in any area. One of the best things to do it grab a few beers and sit in a park like MauerPark or Volkspark Friedrichshain. Either way, get out of Mitte. 

Biking can be intense. Dogs often dont use leashes. You can get by just fine on English. Dont sweat it.


Food:
Mustafa's on Mehringdam is arguably one of the best Doners you'll ever eat.  Currywurst is popular, but its basically a Bratwurst with ketchup and some curry powder I never really got it. Forget Mexican food and while everyone will talk about it - the burgers are crap. Look for Schwarma Makali and check out all the Turkish markets for super cheap veggies. I love Borek. 

Que Pasa at Gorlitzer has an awesome Sunday brunch. 

Weather: It should be warm, but in Central Europe, it almost always gets cold at night (open to interpretation). Ive got a light leather jacket I take everywhere and throw a hoodie on under it if it gets cold. Rain shouldn't be  a problem- its a big city, just jump in a cafe. Also, in my experience, Berlin is pretty grungy. People don't get dressed up to go out. Its very 'come as you are'. You wont see any girls with their tits hanging out or stuff like that. 

Cash: Id just arrange to use my bank card here. Or maybe a few traveler's checks.

In northern Europe perhaps, parents, and/or universities have more opportunities to have students stay in university for 8+ years. And that's actually not even a constant considering the map. Sometimes, including in scientific fields, you don't need so many people to be grounded in the research department of the field. You need more technical people ready to work on the job after 5 years of study, or just 3, rather than a bunch of ultra-specialized people with fewer capable of finding a job because their diploma is too high, and their actual field experience is too low. 

I'm not disparaging PhDs. That's an amazing achievement. But if you don't have one, or if your country has fewer per capita, it doesn't make you lesser. Maybe your country has different needs. Maybe your country can't afford as many PhDs due to different strategies, equally valid, or more, or less... depending on your country's position and tradition, and values. It doesn't make you lesser.

true,Nemo84,BELG,Belgium,"&gt; While I don't know the veracity of the survey, the ""50-60% of voters [still] voted in favor of rejoining Russia"" should not be taken as indicative that Crimeans wanted to join Russia if the voter turnout was possibly as low as 30%

If you want to make that statement, you first would have to prove that the 30-50% that did show up was not representative of the population as a whole. Elections with &lt; 50% voter turnout have consistently been considered fair and democratic in the past. Sometimes, most people just don't care about politics.

And we don't even know anything about the methodology of this survey, so we can't say how accurate that number is.

&gt; as I got the impression from your last sentence that you were implying that the report supported the notion that Crimeans wanted to join Russia.

People were free to vote and even this rather unflattering (for Putin's government) report still shows that the outcome seemingly represented the will of the majority of voters. I would have preferred international observers, but the OSCE refused to send any so we'll unfortunately never know. However, I don't see how anyone with any knowledge at all about the history of the region could find the wish for reunification unbelievable. This has been one of the main political topics in Crimea ever since the fall of the USSR. In 1994, back when Crimea was briefly allowed to have a president, they overwhelmingly elected (72.9%) someone with a platform of eventually rejoining Russia. The 2010 parliamentary election showed 92% of voters in favor of pro-Russian parties, including 80% who voted for Yanukovych's Party of Regions. 

In [May 2013](http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/2013%20October%207%20Survey%20of%20Crimean%20Public%20Opinion,%20May%2016-30,%202013.pdf), 53% of Crimeans wished a customs union with Russia compared to only 17% with the EU. Only 15% of inhabitants consider themselves Ukrainian, while 24% chose ""Crimean"" and 40% picked ""Russian"". 62% didn't like the direction Ukraine was heading into (note: in this period, Yanukovych was still urging the country to cooperate with the EU trade treaty).

Given the history and demographics of the region, coupled with their reported extreme dissatisfaction with the highly unconstitutional events in Ukraine lately, the fact that they currently have absolutely no representation left in Kiev and the imminent threat of IMF austerity for a completely broke Ukraine, it is not at all surprising that they wish to join the country they feel closely related to and which is economically doing a lot better than their current one.",1,1399372761,null,0,1399373163,0,chaucld,t3_24trbb,t1_chaucld,t1_chatsc0,null,1433673069,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

However exploiting it would undermine the push to for renewables, which is why I'm sceptical.

Really? Cause I don't see the organizers of any other election being forced to prove this. The 1996 US presidential election had a turnout of less than 50%, yet I don't see anyone questioning whether or not the result was the will of the majority of the American population.

&gt; As the ballot lacked the option to vote for maintaining the status quo, the organizers claimed that not voting would be counted as a vote for maintaining the status quo.

Citation required. I certainly have never heard this claim. The 1992 constitution, which was the alternative option, is pretty much the status quo option, with the main change being the removal of the changes that Kiev inserted back in 1995 [when they sent 200 armed men to forcibly alter the Crimean constitution and remove the Crimean president from office](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/19/world/ukraine-moves-to-oust-leader-of-separatists.html?&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Meshkov%20crimea%201995&amp;st=cse). It's the original constitution that was written when Crimea agreed to become part of Ukraine.

&gt; Their claimed result of some of Crimeans 97% voting for annexation is silly BS. 

Prove it. The Falklands voted 99.8% to remain British. South Sudan voted 98.8% to secede. Do you doubt these referendums simply because the outcome was so one-sided?

Crimea invited international observers. We in the West refused to send because we did not want to lend credibility to the referendum. So maybe Russia cheated, maybe they didn't. We'll never know, thanks to our own governments' political posturing. 

I'd have much rather seen Crimea and the rest of Ukraine join our little EU experiment. But that is their decision, not mine or anyone else's. I refuse to make unproven accusations just because they better fit my political agenda.

&gt; Additionally you cannot find any polls preceeding the referendum - not a single one - with that kind of support for annexation among Crimeans, showing only minority support for it among the population.

The latest polls were performed long before the Ukrainian president was unconstitutionally removed from office by an armed mob and back when Eastern Ukraine still had strong political representation in Kiev. So those surveys you refer to have little relevance to the current situation or opinions amongst the population. A significant part of Ukraine is currently in armed revolt against the government because of recent events.

true,quantum-confinement,MOLD,Moldova,"What I am especially confused by is how a latent sense of German guilt towards WWII atrocities could possibly be invoked as an argument for supporting recent Russian actions. Ukraine as one of the main theaters of WWII actually saw a greater relative death toll among its population during the Second World War than Russia. After all, a third of Ukraine actually saw combat even before Russia was invaded since the region was part of Poland. Ukraine along with Balarus and the Baltic states suffered by far the most as they were in the meat-grinder between Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR and their civilian populations suffered like no other both during the war and afterwards. 

Therefore if there was still some vague sense of guilt in the general German consciousness, you would think that if anything Germans would be especially sympathetic towards Ukraine. I don't know if the fact that the reverse is true is because of ignorance on the part of the German public or a sense that the Ukrainian Untermenschen shouldn't be viewed as anything more than pawns in the *grosse Politik* of real countries.

Anyway, legal or not that's how things work, leaks showed the US were involved in the choice of government. EU+Russia should have taken that lead to ensure stability rather than leave it to the US who aims for geo strategical gains.

As I said: Neither EN nor US can or should enter the talks with Russia or any other countries on deciding who will govern in Ukraine. There's a difference between being involved by giving advices and directly deciding who will take a seat in a government after the negotiations between 3rd parties. What you said reminds me a return back to the communist era when leaders of PRL were decided in Moscow.

Oh, and FYI: Not only US but also EU sent it's advisers through the process, just like Russia gave advices to Yanukovych while he still was in power. Only after the shooting noone in Kiev wanted to listen to Russians any more, so no wonder Russians didn't want to approve a new government. Even people from the Party of Regions [turned their backs](http://www.novostimira.com.ua/news-eng-100734.html) on Yanukovych after the tragic events.

Then there's a speculation that Russians did wanted to see Ukraine destabilized and all of the perfectly-executed plans we've seen on Crimea and see right now in an East Ukraine were planned long ago and Putin's cabinet was just waiting for a pretext, so even if huge sacrifices would be made to get Russia involved in a creation of the government - they still would put a terms that are intentionally impossible to be approved by anyone in Kiev or western world (eg. Federalization which already came up during the initial talks between EU-US-Euromaidan-Yanukovych-Russia that ended up with a famous agreement that was later on broken by Euromaidan / Yanukovych (depending how you look at it) ).

Great, I'd love to see where they're going to get the money for that. Cut health? Increase taxes? Let alone the bubble they'll create in the insulation business, which we very well experienced in Australia despite not affecting even a tenth of our paltry 20 million people.

&gt;Australia, too, has a basic state pension. Australia also enjoyed solid economic growth, making the stock markets perform well. How will it cope with an economic slump?

The overwhelming majority of Australian pension funds come from superannuation. And as tot he stockmarket... the ASX went from about 6900 in 2007 to 3100 two years later. The stockmarket pretty much halved. You really ought to know what you're talking about before you speak on the topic.

&gt;Since when is poverty or austerity the fault of the greens?

It's not. But their ideological stance shouldn't be 'It's justifiable to fuck over the poor because we're, like, saving the planet, man!'. 

&gt;Obviously it will be, and a fantastic boon to their employability as well. What it won't be is a relevant energy source during the next century and certainly not during the next 50 years. It's always a matter of opportunity cost, and ITER sucks up a quarter of the relevant budget. We can fund a whole score of other worthy projects with that money.

It doesn't matter, I never claimed it would be about environmental causes. All I said was that they were anti-science because they wanted to remove funding for it, something which has massive scientific and engineering applications beyond just fusion power.

&gt;When a fusion reactor in 2100 can produce energy for us to use in 2016, let me know. You have to understand that the biggest, shiniest machine that goes ping isn't necessarily the most efficient investment.

There's not really much difference between completely exterminating them and just *mostly* exterminating them. Either way, it's a completely moronic thing to do in wartime because it just encourages the native population to join the partisans. There wasn't exactly a lack of people who resented communist rule. Others desired national autonomy.

And the Lebensraum concept is totally flawed. There are far too many people to displace in too short a time.

""Do you have any sports weapons, tear gas, religious pamphlets with you"", asks the female customs officer, while her colleague is searching through car and luggage. We don't, just a book on the Saxon fortified churches of Transylvania [the old German name of the region, Siebenbürgen, is used throughout the text - translator's note]. We are allowed to enter.

From now on, there is no road lighting. Our headlights illuminate horse-drawn vehicles and militia posts. The passengers of the Polish Lada in front of us are throwing bonbons through open windows, children are hastily picking them up.

About an hour behind the border, in the outskirts of Arad, dark housing blocks rise against the sky - Orwellian concrete castles, half construction sites, half tomb-like slums, between them, like ghosts, their inhabitants are scampering around.

There are few cars driving around in the city center, here and there horse-drawn vehicles are rattling on the asphalt. From afar, a barely illuminated store seems to be well-stocked, but at a second glance we notice that most shelves are filled with endless rows of canned tomatoes and marmalade. A display cabinet of black and white photos is dedicated to the stages of HIS career: From a simple shoemaker's apprentice to a ""revolutionary who even defies the Sun"". ""Romania-Pace-Ceausescu"" is inscribed above.

In the light of the next day, it's soon obvious how concrete abscesses managed to eat themselves through the landscape. Clear cutting in the medieval town of Sibiu (German Hermannstadt), the former capital of Transylvania. In the outskirts of the lower town there are broken-up bricks next to thin pre-fabricated building material. Elizabeth-Street, covered by a patina of desolation and once a blooming center of commerce, is next, an old inhabitant of Transylvania tells me while walking her Pekingese through backyards overgrown by vines. ""Everything is getting a new look, you are not supposed to see the old one any more"", she whispers and quickly bids farewell, as a curtain is moving behind a window.

The four of us are traveling as two tourist couples in order to not raise any suspicions. Despite this, we are swooshing through the frozen in time Transylvanian village idyll in our Western car as if we were traveling in a space ship. Horse-drawn carriages make their way on farm tracks, hay wagons rumple on gravel roads, passing drawbridges, moats and machicolations that have for centuries fended of hordes of Mongols and marauding Turkish armies. Walther von der Vogelweide (famous German medieval bard and poet - translator's note) could, apparently, appear right around the corner at any point.

The perception of idyllic middle ages in an open air museum is deceiving, though: The warehouses are empty. Food is rationed, rationing cards can only be used in one store in the village - which is mostly closed. During the day, pensioners and children are queuing until the workers return home and the shops have - maybe - opened. It is certainly possible that in one of those queues someone invented the following joke: Who receives toilet paper in Romania? Answer: Only those who can prove they have eaten something before...

Even bread is rationed, to 300 grams per day, flour is rationed to half a kilo per month, sugar is only available every three months, meat rarely at all. Lucky ones occasionally manage to get hold of chicken feet and pig feet, called ""patriots"", because feet are the only parts of an animal, which are not exported.

""You can come by without meat and alcohol"", an old Saxon in front of the Alimentare-store in Cisnădie, previously known as Heltau, ""but I'd like to know what a banana tastes like.""

Shortages and the daily struggle against them are everywhere, in the whole nation. For hours and hours we are passing swaying wheat fields; gaggles of geese and flocks of sheep are crossing our path. Despite this: Hunger. How is it possible for such a wealthy nation to be this poor?

""Every goose is counted"", a boy on a bicycle in Banat tells us, ""everything is exported.""

In the Târnava Mare area we forget a plastic bag full of bell pepper. As we return, the bell pepper is still there, but the plastic bag is gone. Empty margarine boxes are being sold - for one DM a piece.

The misery stuns you, it makes you feel helpless. Our Western ""souvenirs"" have a black market value of incredible proportions: A pound of coffee is worth 120 DM, a pack of cigarettes 25 DM; two boxes of cigarettes are worth as much as the average monthly wage of 3000 Lei in this shadow economy.

Our supplies are quickly gifted away. Nobody is using those souvenirs, though. They travel through many hands, are exchanged for x-ray films or Aspirin or favors from the corrupt caste of government officials. On one occasion, a police officer stops us immediately behind a no passing sign, right in the middle of the road. He confiscates our passports and threatens to tear them apart, until he finds what he was looking for in the back of the car: Coffee and cigarettes. From now on, there are no more problems.

""Land of boon, land of plenty"", they sang in this former breadbasket of Eastern Europe, which Ceaușescu has run down to a poor house in almost a quarter century of bizarre tyranny. Isolated from all developments of the West, Transylvania has preserveda Lutherian-conservative, romantically German culture among its Saxons. They are regarded to be hardworking, clean and ambitious. To us, grown up with rock music and Coca-Cola, they often seem prudish and old-fashioned.

Here, the church still has its place in the village center, even though there are just 880 souls left of more than 3000 believers, like in a small hamlet near Brașov, the former Kronstadt. Despite this, the feeling of belonging is still intact, says the priest about the exodus, which is one day going to leave him without a congregation. The individual doesn't assume an air of importance around here, ""unlike up there in your empire (Germany, anachronistic - translator's note)"".

At the beginning of the Sunday mass, the priest reads out the names of those who left the community in the last week and how much Lei they have left behind. After the mass, we chat with a few seniors. Mrs. Kutschera tells us: ""After the war, the Russians have abducted and deported us to the Ural mountains. Five years of forced labor. Upon our return, the Romanians had taken everything: cottage, cows, wine. For five years we lived elsewhere until we were allowed to return. Our whole lives we have worked hard and now they want to take everything away from us again.""

She points at a nailed up window of a former inn: ""A street as beautiful as this one was nowhere else in Rumania in the past, but now? Gypsies are occupying houses left behind by those who have returned to the empire and are using windows and door frames for heating. Today I'd be happy if the Russians were coming...""

""We are clinging to the clod"", her neighbor says, ""but it's not possible anymore. 800 years of history are coming to an end. There are no children anymore. The young are leaving and we are staying. We can not go to the hospitals, because we are unable to bribe. Death is the only thing left for us.""

We are rarely able to stay for more than a few minutes in a village. For the eyes of the militia we have to create the illusion that we are just asking for the way from our car or are just walking our dog. In Cristian, formerly Grossau, we are meeting two women, mother and daughter, on a 14th century bridge near the church hill. Like four fifth of the 2000 Germans in the village, they just want to leave. ""We applied in '80"", she says in broken German without being asked, ""but they are not allowing our return to the empire. It's sad, but true. Only my sun was courageous enough. He tried to cross the border twice and they caught him twice. They beat him terribly. The third time, it worked. Now he's a tourist guide in Tunisia. He has called his sister and told her that he's fine."" Then, we must have been talking for too long, she suddenly and hastily decides to leave.

A farmer takes us with him for a short while on the coach box. The horses, even the foals following behind, belong to the state. He points at cottages along the way: ""My cousin lived here, now she's in Böblingen (town in Western Germany - translator's note). There my best friend lived, he's now in Canada. Every house has a story to tell around here."" In the outskirts he starts to cry. He had applied for German citizenship 18 years ago.

The roadside villages of Transylvania, led to by old poplar and birch alleys, are not only endangered by the exodus of their inhabitants: Almost two thirds of the 13'000 villages in Romania have less than 1000 inhabitants. Because those places are regarded as economically unprofitable, Nicolae Ceaușescu announced in March 1988 to dissolve half of those villages, meaning: to raze to the ground. Until the year 2000 they are supposed to, as the process is officially called, ""converted into farm land"", they are supposed to, leveled and converted into zero-zones, disappear from the collective memory.

In their place the head of state, who reigns over his country like a crazy allotment holder, plans the erection of 550 urban units for 2000 to 5000 people. In those ""agro-industrial complexes"", the ""city shall come to the countryside"" and control over the population become more intensive. This is, says Ceaușescu, about the ""homogenization of society into the higher existence of a Socialist nation"", the ""elimination of differences between city and countryside, between classes and ethnic groups"", the creation of a handy utilitarian man.",0,1399383001,null,0,false,1,chawqkq,t3_24v1an,t1_chawqkq,t3_24v1an,null,1433674194,85,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,85

Saxon fortified churches are becoming meaningless, empty shells of stone standing around in the countryside in this sytemized Romania. They are going to be replaced by government culture centers in agro-industrial complexes, monstrous bunkers of indoctrination and mobilization, which are going to tell of the ""Spirit of the New Man"" and be called ""Hymns to Romania"".

The forced deportations of about 3 Million people until the turn of the milenium are not only supposed to increase control over the population. Above all, Ceaușescu hopes for the cultural dissolution of unloved minorities, such as the almost 200'000 Germans and the 2 Million Hungarians in the Northwestern part of the country, which fell to Romania after the end of WW2 and has always been a source of unrest.

For now the planned destruction of Transylvanian villages appears to have slowed down due to Ceaușescu's lack of funds, because for now only few communities were visited by bulldozers, such as Ghimbav (formerly Weidenbach) not far from Brașov. Wedge-shaped, the new buildings are growing into the town center. Four years ago the gardens along the long alley were leveled and in their place living boxes for 15 families each have been erected. This took away the farmers' livelihood, who were raising goats and pigs, were growing nut- and apple trees for their own consumption in those gardens. Generally, people are only informed in the last minute. ""They granted us three days to tear down this barn"", laments a toothless old Saxon in the nearby Râșnov, formerly Rosenau, ""we were at least able to save the oak floor for firewood. Then the bulldozer came and tore everything down. The drivers were laughing. It was a crying shame.""

And her neighbor, who is painting his cottage's door displaying German thoroughness, despite the fact that his garden is already spiked with measuring pickets, says: ""If you are not allowed to have a pig and a hare anymore, why continue living?""

Private farming enterprises make up just five per cent of the Romanian farm land, yet a quarter of the total fruit harvest and 15% of sheep meat and venison are produced here. Despite this, the village, the true source of strength of Romania, is going to be grouped into blocks, sectors and right angles.

The new apartment blocks in Râșnov look miserable. Horse-drawn carriages make their way through torn mud, in damp basements wood is rotting that is supposed to be used for heating in the Winter. Clouds of smoke float through holes, cut into the facade, because there are no chimneys. Plastic rags replace window glass. In between mountains of debris, female farmers cower next to each other. Apathy is everywhere. The concrete slums, held together by nothing but drastic improvisation, appear more fragile than the scattered remains of the old buildings.

Future generations of archaeologists are perhaps going to speculate, why in the late 20th century Romania solid brick walls were replaced by fragile pre-fabricated building blocks. They might reach the conclusion that under Ceaușescu architecture has become a political weapon: social engineering by wrecking ball.

As we are leaving, a stumbling man pushes around his bicycle. He looks as if a bottle of ketchup has burst on top of his head. But it is blood, which clots on his undershirt. This man has nothing to dress his open wound with, nobody is helping him. Glazing emptily, he pushes his bike past us.

In the Burzenland (region in the Southern Carpathians - translator's note) we are invited, right from the street, to a wedding. The festivities last for three days, 400 guests have come. Dozens of chickens were made into soup, which is served in the morning with spirits and cake. No expenses are spared, even a band plays music. For years the engaged couple's parents saved for this greatest events in their childrens' lives. Despite this they could never afford this on their own. After the ceremony, guests queue patiently in front of the couple, each of them placing bank notes into a basket. Two girls note, how much each of us gave.

There is no jolly atmosphere. In the community's festival room, the groom's neighbors are sitting on one side, the couple's parents' guests on the other side. In the kitchen, women from the groom's family ridicule the white wedding dress from Germany, as they have appeared wearing tradional costumes. Later they discuss which son is going to serve his military service in the Bundeswehr (West German army - translator's note), meaning how long it is going to be until they receive their passports for departure.

Each year, at least 11'000 Romanian Germans are allowed to leave the country. Allegedly, the Bonn government (then seat of the West German government - translator's note) pays a ""bounty"" of 8000 DM for each emigrant (a similar agreement existed for dissidents from the GDR - translator's note). Only people who can prove that their children or parents are living outside of Romania have a chance of approval. Or people who are marrying a foreigner, which requires approval by Ceaușescu himself, though.

This is Marianne's hope, a distant cousin of the bride. A pro forma marriage is her last chance to leave, because each of her requests of departure has been denied. ""Applying"" almost always results in the loss of employment and of course social ostracism. ""Those who apply do not belong anymore"", says Marianne. ""And those who are already in the Empire up there, also don't belong anymore. The only thing that counts is what they are bringing with them when visiting.""

While the young couple is nervously dancing a Waltz on the dance floor, Marianne talks about the dark daily life in between staying and leaving. She knows a 50 years old teachter from Mediaș (formerly Mediasch), who had to work in a chemical plant for four years, until he, with ill lungs, was allowed to leave. Those who are left behind wait, for years, for decades, live in constant fear. Information and freedom of movement are just as tightly controlled and rationed as staple foods: Just a single - monitored - international telephone call every three months is permitted, local calls from the telephone cell are limited to three minutes. Big Brother hears everything, sees everything and wants to know everything. It was fiction in Orwell's ""1984"", but it's the dark reality under Ceaușescu: the remodeling of a land from reality into surreality.

Even the ownership of a typewriter has to be registered, a font sample needs to be given to the police. Conversations with foreigners have to be protocoled and submitted within 24 hours, inviting them to an overnight stay is forbidden. Domestic post is also read by the state.

Like most, Marianne fears the winter. The daily allowance of electricity is often not even enough for cooking. Light bulbs brighter than 25W are forbidden, as are fan heaters. Mandated room temperature is 12 degrees centigrade. Upon snowfall the government closes the roads in order to not having to issue gas coupons - 30 liters per car and month.

The marching band rattles like a polka, wrapped cabbage is served. Marianne talks about collectively freezing in offices and factories and of surgeons in the hospital of Târgu Mureș (formerly Neumarkt), who have to operate at a room temperature of five degrees centigrade.

Ceausescu's lust for surveillance doesn't even spare the bedroom. Contraceptives are forbidden in Romania, every couple of months, Marianne says, women need to attend a gynecological examination by the company physician. This is supposed to prevent - strictly forbidden - abortions. A childless marriage results in extra taxes. Because until the year 2000, that's what HE decided, the Romanian people shall grow from 23 to 30 Million. ""If you need to queue at four o'clock in the morning, though"", comments Marianna bitterly about the plan that even nationalizes unborn life, ""you are losing every desire for childbearing.""

We continue driving. Fear, distrust and suspicion accompany us while traveling over soft hills and through arable plains. Generally, our hosts ensure there are no unwanted eyes or ears nearby, until we are allowed to leave their houses again. Soon we suspect every car following us, feel for hidden microphones under restaurant tables, cover our luggage and car doors with adhesive tape, suspect cameras hidden inside TVs in hotel rooms.

Speaking of hotels: We have to pay more than $120 for a single room, for malfunctioning elevators, dirty sheets and sticky meals under the watchful eyes of police snitches. For two days we are attempting to let Marianne travel with us, but it is not possible. Her ID card prevents her from booking a room, despite the fact that no hotel is fully booked. She is not welcome in her own country. Finally we get her in over the balcony, secretly, at night, because we have to wait until guards and guests are sleeping. ""I'm buried alive in this place"", says Marianne as a goodbye in a train station next to a dimmed out train.

In Mediaș, a small Transylvanian town with a medieval inner city, we notice the same scene at the marketplace as in Brașov, Sighișoara (formerly Schäßburg) or Alba Iulia (formerly Karlsburg): hurried people with a sad, heavy expression on their faces, who are carrying bundles and packets with them and are rushing somewhere - to a corrupt filling station attendant perhaps, to a queue in front of a bakery, to the entrance of a government office.

We arrived in Mediaș three days later than planned. The food, cooked just for us, still remains untouched on the kitchen table. Preserved for us. And our host claims insistently that she is full already, because the thin vegetable soup would likely not be enough for all of us. Her worn out hands are nervously plucking the waxed cloth while she tells us of Ceausescu's visit in Mediaș: As HE back then arrived in two white helicopters at the sports ground of Mediaș, the cinema, which he wanted to inaugurate, still was an unfinished shell. Without hesitation, a film poster and the inscription ""Cinema"" was attached to the facade, and the Potemkin cinema, which the ""revolutionary who defies the Sun"" then inaugurated, was finished. Previously, teachers trained a game they called ""let the students run"". In order for the crowd to appear larger, children had to run behind houses via shortcuts to the city center after Ceaușescu had driven past to wave with flags there again.

We drive on. Copșa Mică (formerly Klein Kopisch) gained the nickname ""the black village"". Everything is sooted, houses, faces, hands, even market stands, filled with nothing but foul bell pepper and tomatoes. Even the - actually white - poodle has a grayish tint. The layer of dirt comes from outdated tin and lead works, which are cooking in the background. ""For ten years now"", an old man wearing a checkerboard shirt tells us, ""they don't have the money for filter bags anymore. The dirt simply rises into the air."" He points at the stump of a chimney in the distance. ""Looks like it wasn't finished, right? That's not the truth, though, as the upper half was eaten away by sulfuric acid."" Hiding the next sentence behind artificial laughter so that the militiaman on the other side of the street does not notice what he is talking about, he adds: ""Our lungs are all getting ill and the men are not good enough for women anymore. Lead renders impotent.""

It is worse in Prostea Mică (formerly Klein Probstdorf) right next to Copșa Mică, where the wind blows the black smoke of the soot factory almost every day of the year. There are only black sheep around here, both figuratively and literally: In this formerly German village there are mostly Romanians, who were caught at the border and are being forced to work in the factory for 500 Lei, a sixth of the normal monthly wage.

A man who is driving us there in his ""Dacia"" was also caught eight years ago when trying to flee. After being brutally beaten with rifle butts, he was unconscious for two days and still can't hear anything with one of his ears.

Prostea Mică appears to be almost empty, covered by a black-brown layer, which renders every detail of every facade indistinguishable, even the stones of family tombs. In the past, a man tells us, you were able to fish in the river from the bridge, which is barely imaginable now considering the black fluid flowing in between the concrete bank.

After just a few minutes we are already noticing a disgustingly sweet taste from the air in our mouths and our faces are covered by black, oily particles.

""Until two years ago"", says the man, ""people received a daily special ration of two liters of milk. Naturally, they didn't drink it and instead gave it to families with many children. But then infant mortality rates increased and it was forbidden to distribute milk from cows of this region."" And this means that most of the time, there isn't any milk.

It's an environmental apocalypse: Again and again we drive past run-down aluminum and fertilizer factories with rusted or burst exhaust pipes. It reeks of sulfur, of acidic chemicals. Poisonous clouds leave refineries and combinats to rest upon glass houses and fields.

Just before midnight, we arrive in Bucharest. It's nighttime. Monstrous boulevards push through the dark metropolis. They connect pompously classicist buildings with Stalinist monumental structures, pseudo-architecture, for which one fifth of all buildings in the city center were destroyed by bulldozers, among them two dozen churches and monasteries. The Spanish synagogue, the Cotroceni-church, hundreds of Boyar villas and classicist facades - all destroyed by demolition troops.

More than 20'000 people were forcefully evacuated. Just because the Uranus-Antim-Rahova quarter survived the earthquake of 1977 better than other parts of the city. The geological stability of this quarter motivated Ceaușescu to build the ""Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism"" and the ""Boulevard of Youth"" right through here. They lead to the new ""House of the Republic"", to the new seat of the god-king, a kitsch cake made from stone of gigantic proportions.

The city itself though: a dead body. Construction sites everywhere, in between slumbering overgrown half-decayed villas. At night, on every corner, behind every second tree there are policemen and agents of the secret service Securitate. What are they guarding after all? The window dressing of shops along the Calea Victoriei, which often consist of nothing but a shoe, a plate of Romanian gum or a portrait of the titan, in which HE, retouched to look like a chubby man of 45 years, nicely looks at his people?

Securitate has one place especially under control, the Bucharest ""Authenée Palace Hotel"", a dark tourist block that has the charm of a Transylvanian tomb. If you believe General Mihai Pacepa, escaped to the US and former head of foreign intelligence, then all 300 employees, concierges, waiters, maids and taxi drivers are agents of the Securitate. Even telephone cells within one kilometer of the hotel are monitored.

Bucharest's ""Museum of Romanian History"" is dedicated to just two topics: the age of the Dacians 2500 years ago, which Ceaușescu refers to in his theory of a Dacian-Roman heritiage of the Romanians and the ""Epoca de Aur"", the golden age, which this ""hero among heroes of our people"" demands his regency to be celebrated as. A collection of relics shows the visitor what Romania is really like: A, notwithstandingly great, but modest and still kind comrade Ceaușescu and his wife Elena, the ""Comrade Member of the Academy Doctor Engineer"", visit happy cows, happy farmers and happy assembly lines. The inaugurate party congresses, metros, dams, operating rooms and libraries filled with the constantly growing work of Ceaușescu.

Among traditionally costumed groups they dance, marvel at overflowing shelves in sparkling clean supermarkets, at the Black Sea they shake thankful hands. In the stadium there is HIS name written in a see of flowers, in an oil painting he is even immortalized wearing sash and scepter.

When asked for her opinion, a foreign visitor, instead of answering, sticks her index finger into her mouth. She just wants to puke in disgust.

On our way to the border we come across a train. It's rolling to Transylvania.

Loaded with brand-new bulldozers.

Also, Lena is fucking hot. I'm a heterosexual woman, and I look at her and my mind melts. She's like a lovechild between Taylor Swift and Ellen Page.

Yes, but there are slight differences. For example if I ask you what the best pet is and you say that it's cat. I'll be able to say:


    **По мнению** Марса20 кот это лучшее животное 

    **According to** Mars20 cat is the best pet

If on the other hand we do a reasearch and it will show that cats are indeed the best pets I would have to say:

    **Согласно** исследованию кот это лучшее животное

    **According to** a research cat is the best pet

In English *""According to""* could work in both sentences but in Russian *""По мнению""* could only be used when talking about someone's opinion.

Indeed it is. But that's what they've done. I guess they did not have enough resources to do a proper poll, so they decided to just get general feeling of the population.

About 41% of all the water treated in Ireland is lost. This is because for large parts of the country the water network is essentially the same as it was in thee early 1900's. Parts of counties and individual towns are sporadically put on boil water notices due to safety concerns (Boyle, Co. Roscommon has been on boil water notices for almost a year, and on and off for the previous 5 years). Only half of the waste water treatment plants comply with safe water standards. The capital, Dublin, is facing collosal water shortages in the near future, and supply is generally affected at least once or twice a year. It's genuinely a lottery on whether you live in an area with a safe/constant drinking supply in a lot of places in the country. Previously water was the responsibilty of the local councils in each area, but their small size and limited budgets has greatly reduced the amount of investment needed to ensure an adequate water supply. Commercial properties already pay for water. The hope is that by centralising water services that Irish Water will be able to obtain the necessary capital, and water rates to fix the system. It seems to be turning into a bureaucratic nightmare and we haven't even been charged yet.

As for postcode, its worked reasonably well. Most postmen/women know where they're going and. The biggest issue is for emergency services in rural areas. Often times addresses can be very general in rural Ireland. Something like:


* House Name, ^(Optional, most don't have them and completely un-official)
* Townland X, ^(The general rural area, can be a couple of square mile or 20+)
* Nearest Town, ^(Could be 10 miles away or more)

* County


So response times can be massive for rural areas, (ambulance arrives to Ballymurphy Townland, Dunboyne, Galway. But because their are 15 houses in Ballymurphy and no way to know which one they're needed at they get lost on rural back roads trying to find the right turn to someones road but are miles away. They frantically try and call the 999 caller to get better information on the location). When they are introduced they will save lives

Pay back loans with the money saved due to heating oil not bought. The only problem is providing credit to these people, since the market doesn't do that.

&gt;The overwhelming majority of Australian pension funds come from superannuation. 

They, too, have a three-pronged structure where the obligatory contributions you talk about are the second prong. I fail to see the big differences.

&gt;The overwhelming majority of Australian pension funds come from superannuation. And as tot he stockmarket... the ASX went from about 6900 in 2007 to 3100 two years later. The stockmarket pretty much halved. You really ought to know what you're talking about before you speak on the topic.

It's a crapshoot. If those pension funds invested in the wrong stocks they would have trouble.

Anyway, here's the gist (http://www.greens-efa.eu/pensions-8524.html). As you can see, the differences are mostly a matter of which prong to stress.

&gt;It's not. But their ideological stance shouldn't be 'It's justifiable to fuck over the poor because we're, like, saving the planet, man!'. 

Where exactly do they do that?

&gt;If they had superannuation, then that would be covering their pensions until it was no longer sufficient, in which case state pensions could kick in.

See above. That's about what they propose.

&gt;It doesn't matter, I never claimed it would be about environmental causes. All I said was that they were anti-science because they wanted to remove funding for it, something which has massive scientific and engineering applications beyond just fusion power.

That's a rather facile slur based on their stance on a single **budgetary** tradeoff. They never said ""science is evil and therefore ITER must be scrapped"", but instead ""in this limited budgets other projects have a higher priority"".

Ah yes, you're right. The second paragraph mentions the dates of February 21-25, but that's about another poll.

&gt;I find it supports my interpretation of events rather well, so thank you for strengthening my argument.

Well, you wrote that ""the latest polls were performed long before the Ukrainian president was unconstitutionally removed from office"". Not sure about your definition of ""long before"", but this poll was taken that same month, in a period of up til just four days before Yanukovych fled. 

Euromaidan had been raging for months, and the chaos had grown so big that the main question people were asking was whether Yanukovych would escalate the bloody crackdown into Tien-An-Men proportions or be ousted. 

So, I dunno. If you're making some kind of argument about how, hey, on February 18 Crimeans would still have thought that nothing was the matter and the government was safely in pro-Russian hands, and only four days later it all became clear to them, I'm not sure how persuasive that is. I would imagine that the ongoing violence in Kiev and the immediate prospect of revolution would already have pushed most of those who were wary into favouring secession, and the developments a few days later would add some more, but not some huge sudden watershed switch.",0,1399386793,null,0,false,0,chay3ci,t3_24trbb,t1_chay3ci,t1_chax52s,null,1433674839,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Because it was. There were violent protests by a minority of Ukrainians yes. And it didn't look like Yanukovych would have a long remaining career as president. But there is a vast difference between an elected government dealing with a bunch of dissatisfied and violent protestors on 18 February and an illegal completely altered government backed by said violent protestors and a lot of foreign powers that has little support in one half of the country on 23 February.

&gt; and only four days later it all became clear to them, I'm not sure how persuasive that is.

Because the country they were part of radically changed in those 4 days (or maybe 14 days, since we don't know when the Crimean results were gathered), and Russia seemed to be the only one who was actually condemning what basically amounted to an opposition coup designed to take the country into a direction that was widely opposed in Crimea.

&gt; I would imagine that the ongoing violence in Kiev and the immediate prospect of revolution would already have pushed most of those who were wary into favouring secession, and the developments a few days later would add some more, but not some huge sudden watershed switch.

Why? There was little Euromaidan unrest in the East, so these people's lives were little influenced. Post-coup however, one of the first decisions by the unconstitutional government was to vote for repealing a language law benefiting Russian speakers.

&gt;

&gt;The __world population__ is the total number of living [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth). As of March 26, 2014, it is estimated to number 7.161 [billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_million) by the [United States Census Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau) (USCB).  The USCB estimates that the world population exceeded 7 billion on March 12, 2012.  According to a separate estimate by the [United Nations Population Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Population_Fund), it reached this milestone on October 31, 2011.   

&gt;The world population has [continuously grown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth) since the end of the [Great Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_of_1315%E2%80%931317) and the [Black Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death) in 1350, when it was near 370 million.  The fastest growth rates – global population increases above 1.8% per year – occurred briefly during the 1950s, and for longer during the 1960s and 1970s. The global growth rate peaked at 2.2% in 1963, and has declined to below 1.1% as of 2012 [update].  Total annual births were highest in the late 1980s at about 138 million,  and are now expected to remain essentially constant at their 2011 level of 134 million, while deaths number 56 million per year, and are expected to increase to 80 million per year by 2040. 

&gt;The UN projects steadily declining population growth in the near future, with the global population expected to become between 8.3 and 10.9 billion by 2050.   [UN Population Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Population_Division) estimates for the year 2150 range between 3.2 and 24.8 billion;  one of many independent mathematical models supports the lower estimate.  Some analysts have questioned the sustainability of further world population growth, highlighting the growing pressures on the environment, global food supplies, and energy resources.

[**REALLY?**](http://www.ebrd.com/downloads/research/economics/events/Vienna_timeline.pdf)

Could have fooled me. 

The 2009 Vienna Initiative was such a successful crisis-response plan that the EBRD wrote [**working papers**](http://vienna-initiative.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/De-Haas-et-al-2012.pdf) about it, and by 2010, [**ECFIN even began downplaying that a crisis ever occurred in Poland**](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/country_focus/2010/pdf/cf-7-02_en.pdf).

Of course, the media has given the EU's successes so little attention, that its no great surprise that people only see the doom and gloom. That's the story the media tells. 

I even once ran into a Hungarian MP in 2012 who was in Brussels to discuss the Hungarian reaction to the crisis. When I asked him what opinion he had about the Vienna Initiative, he admitted that he hadn't heard of it (I'm not quite sure how you can be an elected official, and not know a thing like that....but there you go).

The biggest motivator for getting a Ph.D. in the STEM fields in Germany is in my experience the job prospects. Many people consider the Ph.D. to be the degree that qualifies you to do any professional work in chemistry and many fields of physics. 

Pay is much better and (especially in chemistry) people without Ph.D.s are severely limited on the R&amp;D career ladder. If you ever want to lead a group or even a lab, you better have a Ph.D.

I would say that its more like:

So either the individual European nations **realize** they each have to take a step back for the whole to be successful, or the EU institutions can finally get their act together. 

Instead what we saw since 2008 was:

- the ECB saying that proper crisis prevention and reaction was ""outside of their mandate"", 

- the EBRD successfully rescued only Eastern europe, but not Southern Europe, 

- the EFSF/ESM refused to act in response to the crisis, despite the fact that crisis response was the agency's sole job. 

- There was no macro-prudential coordination for financial and bank regulation until 2010. Having a currency union, but then no macroprudential coordination, was just...well, stupid. 

- Due to lack of EU-level crisis response, countries had to call one-another for bilateral help. 

All of this speaks to a deep lack of coordination, which, for better or worse, needs to be addressed if the EU is ever going to be able to respond to a crisis properly. ",0,1399389696,null,0,false,0,chazb4r,t3_24rjue,t1_chazb4r,t1_cha3lzr,null,1433675406,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

I don't think you really understand what it's like being poor. They don't have insulation because they can't free up the investment money to buy it for some reason, not because they're genetically inferior or something. And thus they're stuck buying expensive heating oil for their ancient heating apparatus in their drafty house.

&gt;On a far, far, smaller scheme than the Australian one, which still leaves the majority of their liabilities in the hands of the government.

As they will inevitably be, as a matter of last resort. What are you going to do if the private pension funds fail, let those pensioners rot?

&gt;It's far from a crapshoot, and only goes to reinforce what I said before about you not understanding concepts like economics and the stockmarket.

Typical, disagree with the ""capitalism knows best"" rhetoric, and they call you an uneducated dunce.

&gt;You said that austerity and poverty weren't the fault of the Greens, but then said it was fine to fuck over the poor with higher heating fuel costs by limiting the use of fossil fuels.

No, *you* say that. *I* said it's better to invest in insulated housing so their heating costs are reduced and the poor don't even *need* fuel any more. 
The same goes for pensions, by the way: people who start out poor won't be able to afford better private pension schemes and therefore remain locked in poverty. At least with a minimal government pension everyone has some basic decency in their old age.

&gt;Their fear-driven stance to nuclear is well known. 

Don't remind me of the latest nuclear campaign: ""We have to go all-out for nuclear *or the lights will go out!!!*"". 

&gt;For the greens, the only kind of science that matters is when it's related to solar or wind.

Science fiction is not science. Come back when you have your magic nuclear plant ready, I'm tired of looking at sky pie. Breeders/thorium will take at least twenty years, fusion at least fifty, and that's being charitable because that's what they said twenty and fifty years ago too.

Wenn ich arbeite und einen Mehrwert für die Allgemeinheit erzeuge, erwarte ich auch, dass alle die dazu in der Lage sind, mir dabei Helfen diese Last zu schultern.

Anstelle davon, dass manche Leute aus Lust und Laune einfach gar nicht arbeiten, sollte man dann einfach die Arbeitsstunden in der Woche zB auf 30h verringern. Wenn das mit Automation gut abzufangen ist, dann ist das der richtige Weg.

Aber dass manche Leute arbeiten und andere dafür gar nicht, halte ich nicht für den richtigen Weg. Alle Menschen müssen der Gesellschaft einen Mehrwert bringen, außer Sie sind nicht dazu in der Lage.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"Mate normally I like your posts, but now you're getting into really stupid territory.

&gt;I don't think you really understand what it's like being poor. They don't have insulation because they can't free up the investment money to buy it for some reason, not because they're genetically inferior or something. And thus they're stuck buying expensive heating oil for their ancient heating apparatus in their drafty house.

So how are they going to pay for the insulation? Just not pay for heating for an entire winter so they can afford it the next time? This is my point, the only way the Green party could get nationwide insulation is through massive spending.

&gt;As they will inevitably be, as a matter of last resort. What are you going to do if the private pension funds fail, let those pensioners rot?

They can't fail. They're not set up like that. You simply don't know enough about the stockmarket or the Australian superannuation scheme to understand this.

&gt;No, you say that. I said it's better to invest in insulated housing so their heating costs are reduced and the poor don't even need fuel any more. The same goes for pensions, by the way: people who start out poor won't be able to afford better private pension schemes and therefore remain locked in poverty. At least with a minimal government pension everyone has some basic decency in their old age.

Again, where are you going to get the money for this? As to the pension schemes, they're *compulsorily paid into by the employer*. There is no minimum finance limit, you're still talking about something you simply have no knowledge of. As I said, Australia retains a minimum state pension, but this is only for those that have exhausted their superannuation, or weren't alive before superannuation was introduced.

&gt;Don't remind me of the latest nuclear campaign: ""We have to go all-out for nuclear or the lights will go out!!!"".

Yeah, and that's a ridiculous stance. But that's not what I argued. 

&gt;Science fiction is not science. Come back when you have your magic nuclear plant ready, I'm tired of looking at sky pie. Breeders/thorium will take at least twenty years, fusion at least fifty, and that's being charitable because that's what they said twenty and fifty years ago too.

I already said that there were huge other scientific applications for this beyond fusion power, and that I wasn't expecting it to be a magic power saviour. Are you purposefully being dense, or what?

Prima fra tutte e' la natura colonialista dell'uso del drone. Per cui come dice qualcuno piu' sotto, se non credi nel colonalismo o se non condividi certe logiche imperialiste, il drone E' moralmente inaccettabile. 

Se, legittimamente, di colonialismo e imperialismo non te ne fotte una sega considera almeno quello che Foucault definisce come Boomerang colonialista e cioe' che l'introduzione di nuove tecnologie e forme di disciplina da parte di poteri coloniali su corpi coloniali E' QUASI SEMPRE un preludio all'uso di questi mezzi dentro i confini del potere coloniale stesso. Questo e' evidente qua in USA: iper-incarcerazione, ghettizzazione, sorveglianza, droni-polizia, stato di eccezione permanente, ecc...

Infine il drone e' la prima forma di warfare technology che permette, implementa e in un certo senso promuove quello che e' definito come uno  ""stato di guerra permanente"" che e' uno dei motori principali del ""military industrial complex"" e del suo modello di capitalismo neoliberal.

No, they paid, but they got a big discount. From the article:

&gt; Private investors were allowed to purchase the new shares at an 80% discount from the price the state had paid for shares only a few months before – they paid a measly 31 cents per share whereas the state had forked out 154 cents per share.

For your second question:

&gt; Also why? Here the state basically just bought Dexia and kept it and reformed it.

The official reason, according to the article, was: “because Pireus and Alpha banks were returning to private ownership, keeping Eurobank under public ownership for a little while longer would damage its reputation in the market place”. The author makes an alternative interpretation in the comments. He says:

The main tactic seems to be to either say the exact opposite of the truth, or accuse your opponent of what you've been doing yourself too. These reasoning ... it shows Clemens Wergin is so nationalist he has lost all contact with reality.

A poll shows 45% of the Germans are firmly pro-Western and 49% believes we need to talk with both sides, and he concludes that Germany is anti-American and pro-Russian? It shows the exact opposite. 

He draws a parallel to the Iraq war and calls the opponents of it hypocrite. But there were never even talks of boycotting the United States. No, there were only two camps, and neither of them wanted to impose a trade embargo against the US 'because it's more important than trade interests'. No, there was only a camp that didn't want a war, and a camp that even wanted to participate in it. 

Wergin must be a deluded nationalist, it cannot not be the case. And the New York Times decided to publish this garbage. At least it's on the opinion page, though I still think we may clasify this as propaganda.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; But I'm not even really sure what you mean, when you are talking about 'doing away' with the 'alliance' between the U.S. and Germany, in any event. 

The bringing of troops home is just a side effect for me.  The primary directive is to get our military back under control and not spread across the globe.

&gt;For example, no European politician has called for the removal of U.S. troops (France under DeGaulle was a time when the question was much more complicated). Why is that? First, if it seems as though nothing is happening, the chances for war are virtually nil, things are nice and stable - then we know that the U.S. military in Europe is doing its job!

The job of the US military is to protect the US, not Europe.  Europeans are perfectly capable of protecting themselves.  I can't think of a group of people that needs protecting less.  And I couldn't care less about some European politicians.  I care about the desires of the populace.

This all just a mentality that I can't grasp.  The new (past 60 years) American way of thinking that we are the exception and nobody else can be trusted to guide the world.  It is crap and it is killing us slowly.  It isn't up to us to keep Germany from making nukes.  It is up to Germany.  It isn't up to us to keep Russia from meddling in their old sphere of influence any more than it is the job of Thailand to do so.

'Allow the French/English traders to trade there' is a bit of an understatement. They collected tax on every slave that passed through the island, which was apparently a lot, transported English and French slaves across the atlantic using Swedish ships and more than likely traded in slaves in their short lived african colonies. Apparently they were also a major supplier of the iron chains.

Look at what cars are on Romania's streets if you don't believe me, compare to 99% Dacias in communism. And why do you think we have so many traffic jams now? Yes, it got worse in that sense because too many people have cars now. There was no traffic jam in communism, because people didn't have cars, not to mention that half of cars were not allowed on the roads in the weekend to save gas -- oh, you remember the queues for gas?

On the other hand Poland had some successes in integrating the country, and started fast industralization (Central Industrial Region).

Edit:

&gt; Of all these, Ukrainians were the biggest problem. Most aggressive, most uneducated. During the war, they were an enormous help to the Germans

They were as aggresive and uneducated as Poles during the Partition times. The Ukrainian country in west was conquered by Poland and in East by Soviets. Then before you portray them as ""those bad guys"", guess, who fought both Soviets and Poles during WW2? Who could they ally with? Then duing the war they also started fighting Germans, when Germany didn't agree to allow independent Ukrainan state.

Pay off the credit with the money saved by the insulation. The state only is intermediary financier because it has more stability and better interest rates than poor families, and recoups those opportunity costs by reducing poverty and foreign energy dependency.

&gt;They can't fail.

And the Titanic couldn't sink either, and tulip bulbs would never fall in price. That notion is the surest indicator they're going to get in trouble. And when they do, the taxpayer will pick up the bill.

&gt;Again, where are you going to get the money for this? As to the pension schemes, they're compulsorily paid into by the employer. There is no minimum finance limit, you're still talking about something you simply have no knowledge of. As I said, Australia retains a minimum state pension, but this is only for those that have exhausted their superannuation, or weren't alive before superannuation was introduced.

So the state does indeed fill in the gaps with taxes if those funds underperform. Again, not that much of a difference I think, except that the risk is increased more if you put more money into long-term funds.

&gt;Yeah, and that's a ridiculous stance. But that's not what I argued.

And yet that's the core of the nuclear argument: everything else is ""unreliable"", only nuclear is safe.

&gt;I already said that there were huge other scientific applications for this beyond fusion power, and that I wasn't expecting it to be a magic power saviour. Are you purposefully being dense, or what?

No, it's the reason why the Greens prioritize other projects, that's why I stress it. You do realize that keeping the ITER black hole in the EU budget necessitates cuts in other science projects, do you? And ITER already needs triple the projected budget... let's kick this cuckoo chick out of the nest. Or increase the EU budget, that's okay too.

&gt;It's not wishfull thinking that we'll get to that point where we can properly utilise it. It's just a matter of it taking quite a while and how long it'll take that's uncertain. If anything reducing the budget will only increase that time regardless of how long it is.

That can be said for other projects too, why not scrap ITER to increase their funding then?

&gt;

&gt;An [e-book reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book_reader) is a portable electronic device that is designed primarily for the purpose of reading [e-books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book) and periodicals.

&gt;E-book readers are similar in form to a [tablet computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer), and usually refer to readers that use [electronic paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper), which means better readability of their screens especially in bright sunlight, and longer battery life. When disconnected from the web, an e-book reader's battery will last from weeks to months. A tablet computer typically has a faster screen capable of higher refresh rates which makes them more suitable for interaction.

&gt;Any device that can display text on a screen can act as an e-book reader, but without the advantages of the e-paper technology.

Pour faire court, ceux qui s'opposent principalement aux méthodes analytiques mettent en avant son manque de scientificité, mais aussi de rentabilité. Le travail ne se fait évidemment pas de la même manière qu'avec des thérapies brèves, ou avec du tout-médicament. Ce débat a lieu en France mais beaucoup moins aux USA où la psychanalyse passe pour être complètement désuète. Sauf que là où ça devient intéressant, c'est que je vois pas mal de publications sur r/psychology ou r/psychiatry qui aujourd'hui confirment telle ou telle hypothèse/idée de Freud, ou d'un autre.
L'idée c'est que la psychanalyse (et toutes les méthodes qui y sont associées) n'est pas un dogme, figé et immuable. Les théories de Freud sont loin d'être comprises aujourd'hui comme ayant valeur d'absolu. C'est une discipline faite pour être en mouvement, et heureusement d'ailleurs.

C'est donc un livre qui définit ce qui est de l'ordre de la pathologie ou non. Ce manuel est co-écrit par des groupes de travail composés de dizaines de psychiatres américains ; or il est de notoriété publique que 50 à 90 % (selon les groupes de travail) de ces psychiatres ont des conflits d'intérêt puisqu'ils travaillent (pour la grande majorité) en tant que consultants pour des labos pharmaceutiques.
Donc le problème se pose ainsi : les professionnels, qui décident de ce qui est pathologique ou non, ont intérêt à ce que les prescriptions médicamenteuses soient faciles, puisqu'elles leur permette indirectement de gagner de l'argent. La pathologie est un marché livré au lobbying.
Je te donne un exemple très simple ; je travaille avec une patiente depuis plusieurs mois. Pour faire court, cette patiente a déliré à plein pot pendant dix ans, en continuant à vivre seule, sans que jamais elle ne ressente une quelconque souffrance. D'après le DSM, cette patiente est schizophrène puisqu'elle remplissait déjà les critères associés à cette pathologie. Sauf que de mon point de vue, et de celui de la plupart des psychos en France, notamment ceux qui travaillent avec les méthodes analytiques, le fonctionnement de cette patiente était certes délirant, mais ni source de souffrance,(c'est d'ailleurs le rôle du délire à la base) ni source de danger pour quiconque ; à quoi bon entamer une thérapie ou prescrire des médicaments dans ce cas ? Je n'en vois aucun.
Pour donner quand même un avis positif sur le DSM ; ça permet d'être d'accord sur les patients avec lesquels on travaille entre professionnels, et aussi dans la recherche, que ce soit au niveau national ou mondial. Je n'ai jamais eu besoin de ce manuel, et j'ai d'ailleurs travaillé avec un psychiatre qui travaille presque toujours sans poser de diagnostic. On vit très bien sans, à partir du moment où on s'intéresse à un individu dans sa  singularité propre (c'est le principe indispensable des méthodes analytiques).

Jetzt zu den Spots, oberflächlich:

**CDU:** Nett aufgemacht, sieht aber mega gruselig aus. Die meisten Gesichter wirken fast schon künstlich. Und natürlich Mutti, weil sie CDU *ist* (hat sie abgenommen?).

**SPD:** Mit Abstand der beste von allen. Cinematographisch - top für einen Wahlwerbespot. Schöne Aufmachung, tolle Bilder etc. Trotzdem langweiliges Blabla mit Klavieruntermalung a la Apple.

**Grüne:** Archivmontage, *hippe* Musik, kleine Animation nach Tutorial gebastelt - wirkt verspielt, aber zieht niemals bei Leuten über 15.

**FDP:** Hat er mir da jetzt eine Versicherung angedreht?

**Linke:** Hah! Gut an das Thema rangegangen. Die Polemik der anderen auf den Arm nehmen, indem man sein Programm genau damit vorführt. Coole Idee, simpler Aufbau. Die Fake Voyeur-Kamera nervt nur tierisch. Das Ende war dann auch irgendwie vorhersehbar: Komplett viral, ohne direkte Message checkt ja sonst keiner.

**CSU:** BAYERN IST [ÜÜÜÜROPAAAA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKNxgjj5T8Q). Ne, echt. Ein Gespräch mit Horst bei Bier und Brezeln und das noch auf Augenhöhe! Der letzte Satz war aber einfach der Killer + Gestik. Unbezahlbar!

**FREIE WÄHLER:** 0815 Spot. Nichts besonderes, nichts getraut. Gut ist auch: ""Europa bist DU, misch Dich ein. Gehen Sie am 25.05 wählen"".

**Republikaner:** Schlechtes Keying, alles abgelesen, aggressiv, steif, und dann kommt ein ganz neuer Spot? Wirkt wie Teleshopping. 

**Tierschutzpartei:** Brille: Fielmann. Fürchterlicher *Plot*. Mega schlecht geschnitten, gefilmt, geschauspielert. Schulvideo-Like.

**FAMILIE:** Ziemlich lässig und cool. Gut umgesetzt. Erinnert mich irgendwie an [den hier.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYsw0KVRjCM)

**PIRATEN:** Internet! Daten!... achja und andere Sachen auch. Langweiliges Video. Wirkt alles verkrampft. Bisschen wie ein Bewerbungsvideo für einen Onlinecontest. Ausgerechnet bei den Piraten habe ich mir mehr erhofft - die wollen aber wohl seriöser wirken.

**ÖDP:** Animation geht so. Wirkt eher wie ein Radiospot, Video wird nebensächlich. Ist auch eine Slideshow.

**PBC:** Alles abgelesen. Shitty Video, langweilig, anstrengend.

**Bayernpartei:** Ich sehe nur Geld und Blau-Weiß - könnte man auch muten und den Horst darüber quatschen lassen. Ergänzt sich.

**Christliche-Mitte:** Was passiert denn da? Ist das das ganze Programm? 

**AUF:** Auch wieder 0815 - langweilig. Tolles Bild bei der Weichen-Metapher, krass.

**DKP:** Der Kerl erinnert mich an die Steineschmeißer aus meinem Abijahrgang. Die Oma sieht aus wie ein rasierter Marx. Diesmal gutes Keying beim Greenscreen, aber wenig Abwechslung. Aber nett untermalt mit den eingeschobenen Typos.

**BüSo:** Horror-TV Beitrag. Schlecht und ganz nette Animationen. Keine Musik, sehr trocken.

**PSG:** Finde die Aufmachung ganz cool. Wie Herr Rippert dort steht und wütend mit rauchiger Stimme meckert. Für nen Wahlwerbespot leider zu aggressiv. Der macht mir eher Angst. Danach das selbe nochmal, nur *unepischer*.

**AFD:** Wut. Wut. DIE KLAUEN UNS UNSERE JOOBS blaa... Die Einspieler wirken authentisch, die Einblendungen jedoch robotermäßig. Und schön blond (bis auf den qualifizierten Quoten-Ausländer).

**Pro NRW:** Alles dreckig, alles Ausländer. Kommt ohne Off-Text aus. Dann die Musik. Musste echt lachen - aber meinen die das wirklich ernst? Als Werbespot geht das gaaar nicht.

**MLPD:** Yes. Matrix. Daten. Wieder gammliger Greenscreen und eintönig abgelesen.

**NPD:** Europa, Kulturen. Ist das noch NPD? Und dann Udo Voigt, der echte Rechte. Ach herr je. „Europa wählt Rechts“. Zu wenig blonde. Was ist da los? Löst hier die AFD ab?

**Die PARTEI:** Billig gemacht - Das Mikrofon war voll zu sehen.... Und die Sonnebrille lenkt mich einfach zu sehr ab. Und der Text wirkt so bekannt... Das kann doch nicht wahr sein!

**Volksabstimmung:** Keine Ahnung, ob der Opa das überlebt hat.",0,1399406068,null,0,1399415502,0,chb779o,t3_24w09p,t1_chb779o,t3_24w09p,null,1433679191,4,false,de,t5_22i0,4

J'avais 0 expérience, peu ou pas de contact, pas de diplôme, je sortais pas tout juste de l'école non plus, j'avais plus de 20 ans, et en prime, pas de permis ni de véhicule.

Autant  dire que franchement, c'était mal barré.

Ma démarche a été de trouver au plus vite un boulot, même très pourri, afin de subvenir a mes besoins. (usines etc) Franchement, j'ai fait des boulots de merde, et de l'interim. Ça a pas mal d'inconvénients (pas de stabilité, contrats de petite durée, impossible de se projeter, etc.) mais ça paye en général plutôt bien.

Sur mon temps libre, m'auto-former sur l'informatique d'entreprise (qui n'as rien à voir avec l'informatique ""de base""), sur des choses comme Active Directory, VMware, HyperV, Sauvegardes, Automatisation etc. (Si tu as besoins de ressources je peux les retrouver, d'ailleurs, ces ressources sont gratuites). **Ça, pour moi c'est optionnel, mais ça peut être un bon point sur un CV/entretien.** Aussi, passer le code/permis si pas déjà obtenu, ça facile beaucoup de chose.

Phase finale, continuer a chercher un autre taff plus pérenne et qui pourrait nous plaire. Que ce soit au niveau de la boite, du boulot, de la longueur du contrat, etc.. On a le temps puisque de l'argent continue a rentrer grâce au 1er boulot.

Une fois que le 1er boulot a été trouvé, le reste vient tout seul (si on reste dans le même domaine). Des contacts auront été fait, l’expérience engrangé, et une meilleure stabilité.

J'ai commencé par des taffs alimentaires pourris, pour ensuite partir sur des mi-temps dans l'informatique, puis des temps pleins avec toujours de plus en plus d’expérience et de facilité a trouver un taff.

Après, il faut certainement adapter tout cela a ta situation mais pour moi ça a bien fonctionné.

N’hésites surtout pas si t'as besoins d'information sur les boulots de tech/administrateur info, jsuis arrivé avec 0 connaissances et un niveau bof, pour autant je bosse actuellement sur des parcs de plus de 100/150 PC avec aisance et je suis pas einstein, c'est super intéressant mais avoir une passion de l'info ne suffit pas, c'est très différent de se qu'on pourrait s'imaginer, et pas toujours dans le bon sens, mais moi j'adore !

En tout cas, j'espère que ça t'aura un peu aidé/éclairé, c'est assez compliqué, on se dit que c'est insurmontable et ont a les idées noires, mais ça peut très vite s'arranger !

&gt;M.G.-Q.: Yes, it is. ITER is a hugely exciting project, but we couldn't continue with the situation where every time there was a cost overrun, the research budget was raided [to plug the gap]. That was [why the European Commission proposed] that ITER's budget should be outside of the [European Union's 7-year budget caps]. We didn't succeed in this, but it is outside Horizon 2020's budget, which is very important from the researchers' point of view.

http://www.nature.com/news/outcry-over-eu-budget-plan-1.9506

This article discusses how ITER funding endangers for example the GMES satellite program (which delivers real cutting-edge services as soon as it's launched and stayed within budget, while ITER is a gamble and already costs three times as much as planned in 2006), and how removing it from the EU budget still leaves open the option to fund it with contributions of the member states.

&gt;“Year after year the European Parliament was asked to mobilise higher sums of public investments than initially agreed on. In 2012 and 2013 alone ITER will cause 1.3 billion Euros in additional costs,” Trüpel notes.  “ITER puts a heavy burden on the slim shoulders of the European Budget. This is why we Greens will fight for mechanisms that will make sure that ITER will not eat up other money dedicated to other more important research projects.”",0,1399408186,null,0,false,0,chb89lf,t3_24uenv,t1_chb89lf,t1_chb4p72,null,1433679693,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

D'ailleurs heureusement qu'il y a des conflits, ce serait le contraire qui serait inquiétant ; la psychologie est encore une science toute jeune...
Le mouvement antipsychiatrique en France a eu une grande influence dans les années 80, et c'est notamment grâce à ça que les CMP ont été créés : au lieu d'enfermer tout le monde, proposer un espace de soin psychique en ambulatoire, lorsque la condition du patient le permet, s'est avéré bénéfique certes d'un point de vue économique, mais surtout humain. Aujourd'hui, il ne reste pas grand chose de ce mouvement en faculté, en dehors de mes lectures j'ai du entendre le terme 2 ou 3 fois en 5 ans. Cependant, ce point de vue décalé aura permis aussi l'avènement de certaines disciplines, comme l'ethnopsychiatrie, l'anthropologie psychanalytique ou encore (la plus connue) la thérapie systémique. Grosso modo, l'idée c'est de déplacer la pathologie d'un point de vue strictement individuel (comme c'est le cas dans la psychanalyse ou les thérapies brèves) à un point de vue global. En thérapie systémique on considère que l'individu malade est le symptôme du système familial, et que cet individu concoure au fonctionnement du système. En thérapie ethnopsychanalytique (qui s'adresse souvent aux premières ou secondes générations de migrants) on fait intervenir des co-thérapeutes de cultures différentes afin d'ancrer les éléments symptomatiques dans une perspective culturelle : une bouffée délirante, ou des idées de sorcelleries  ou d'envoutement n'auront pas la même dynamique chez un patient franco-français depuis X générations que chez un fils d'immigré camerounais. Toutes ces méthodes ont leur intérêt, et dans l'exercice idéal du métier, la seule question qui doit prévaloir au delà de toute question personnelle d'idéologie est ""Qu'est ce qui est bon pour ce patient"".

Complaining about the government, corruption, police, media, etc. is like complaining about the weather here in the UK. Everybody does it.


The only people who are fluent are those who are native or long term immigrants from an early age. Russian is one of those languages so complex that you will make mistakes, so many, and even though something's not a mistake technically, another term/phrase would fit better and you would never know. [Diminutive forms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminutive#Russian) are a massive pain in the ass.


Edit, some more.


There is this thing regarding car culture. It might have changed since I left Russia a few years ago though. Since most people live in commieblocks, the only way to show off your wealth is through your car. You either have ladas and all sorts of crap driving around, or a new Mercedes. There's no middle ground.


Cold weather will make you sick. Cold drinks will make you sick. Apparently.


Our crisps have weird as hell (but fucking awesome) flavours. Red Caviar Lays. Shashlik Lays.


A lot of Russians wear crosses, since they're Orthodox Christians. However, even non religious people or those who believe but don't practice religion wear them, it's just what people do I guess. Even the youtuber VitalyZdTV wears one.


Maybe obvious, but we drink tons of tea.


Speaking of drinking, we have a special design on a glass for drinking everything. It's not called a glass either, but a [table glass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table-glass) hahah. It's supposedly harder to break. A very Soviet looking thing.

Sinon, à part ""le monde est raciste et je n'ai rien à prouver"", tu as un argument ?

Tu n'as aucune idée du système de recrutement dans une entreprise. C'est un domaine dans lequel le recruteur doit justifier ses décisions à ses supérieurs, c'est un domaine où le risque de se tromper en embauchant est immense, et le processus de recrutement engendre des coûts importants.

Rien qu'un SMIC coûte [19596€](http://www.expert-comptable-tpe.fr/posts/view/cout-salaire-smic-charges-patronales) par an à une entreprise. Le coût moyen d'un recrutement en France [est de 8000€](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recrutement#Enjeux_d.27une_d.C3.A9marche_de_recrutement).

Tu crois vraiment que des considérations irrationnelles ont leur part vu l'ampleur des enjeux ?

Tu vis probablement dans une petite bulle loin des contraintes financières, mais le monde ne fonctionne pas comme ça.

La logique et la rationalité sont primordiaux vu les coûts financiers que ça représente.

&gt;J'ai tapé juste

Tape tant que tu pourras.

&gt;Tu cherches que les articles qui vont dans ton sens ?

Tu refuses tout ce qui contredit ta vision du monde ?

&gt;Cherche de l'autre côté, et vois le nombre d'études sur le sujet.

Aucune étude sans exception ne prouve une quelconque discrimination généralisée envers un sexe où une minorité.

&gt;Et remarque le qualificatif ""childless"" et ""in their twenties"". Je suppose que t'as pas bien lu ton article.

*If you insist that the gender wage gap is a result of discrimination against women, here are a few other claims that must be equally true. By the same logic, young men are discriminated against in favor of young women. Women in their 20s without children out-earn men by as much as $1.08 to every dollar, according to some estimates. It must also be true that white men are discriminated against in favor of Asian-American men, who earn over 5 percent more than white men.*

Ça s'appelle un raisonnement. Je sais, c'est difficile pour toi ce genre de choses, ça fait appel à ce qu'on appelle la réflexion, dont tu sembles dépourvu.

&gt;Note que bien des études sont plus récentes.
Et j'en ai encore plein. Mais elles vont pas dans ton sens, je l'admets.

*This is misleading. The statistic Obama cites is only the average difference between men and women, across all jobs. It doesn’t control for the types of job, the number of hours worked or for time taken off (to raise children, for example).*

*Once you control for factors such as college major, time off of the labor force to raise children, and hours worked per week, the gender wage gap essentially disappears. A big part of the difference in pay is due to the choice of jobs: women choose to enter career fields that pay less than those that men choose.*

**In short, firms aren’t discriminating against women. The reality remains that women, on average, do earn less than men. But to blame it on discrimination is misguided.**

&gt;Et j'en ai qui t'expliquent aussi le problème de la ""rationalisation"" de ce que tu admets pourtant comme une discrimination.

Research deals with proportions, not with absolutes.

But if, say, 50% of the CVs with a Dutch name and only 5% of those with an Arabic name are invited when the qualifications are otherwise the same, that's proof that there's more than just random variation going on.

&gt; There are a lot of criteria which are used to eliminated some candidates. It's very likely that a lot of ethnic minorities do not meet these criteria. This can be caused by cultural differences and not just by discrimination.

We're talking about written applications here: the research dealt purely with whether the ""applicants"" were invited for an interview in the first place.

true,Tom1099,POLA,Poland,"You have bringed out the events from WW2, when the discussion is about the economy in between the wars. It seems you are escpecially sensitive about that case. Well, polish internet is recently massively bombarded by anti-Ukrainian propaganda reminding about Volhyn mssacre. I don't deny these events; but I saw no point in recalling them in this thread and I don't think they are evidence that Ukrainians are some kind of ""worse"" people. Many nations in the world have blood on their hands (and Poles can be proud, that in their situation they have so little), and Ukrainians are not an exception. But if you would have to point out any nation in the interwar, which caused most damage to Polish economy, you have Germans on one side and Russians on the other. Poland wouldn't have a problem with Ukrainians, if they had their own country or be in federation with Poland (Pilsudski's idea). But of course Polish nationalists had to make one, big, powerful state. 

&gt;23 years they have their state now, starting at being more developed than Poland was. All they managed to do was to waste everything, proving that they don't deserve their own country. No army investments to explain the constant economic catastrophe, unless they were courses in professional surrendering. 

Yeah, it's not like there were 50 years of sovietization, and destroying of nation. And Ukrainians twice were trying to change that (Orange Revolution, and now Euromaidan). And look on the map: who makes majority of those homo sovieticus ruining the country, acting against it, antipatriots? Yes, people from East Ukraine, that were brainwashed by Russians or are Russians themselves, resettled there by Stalin. Youth and Western Ukrainians want to change that (you must have heard of Euromaidan for God's sake).

&gt;Ukraine couldn't be conquered by Poland, nor by USSR, because such country didn't exist before 1991. The nationality itself is a xix century invention mostly by bored serfs, like Shevchenko. 

There weren't Ukrainian nobility, because most of it were destroyed (thanks, Mongols) or polonised (like Lithuanian). But don't try to say Slovaks, Lithuanians, Belarussians, Latvians are not nations, becuase they were serfs. Most Poles were serfs too (80% IIRC).

Anyone would be an idiot to oppose free trade in principle: The whole EEA is built around the principle that seeing other nations as potential trade partners instead of enemies reduces conflict!

Further enhancing trade between the US and EU will lead to tighter economic links and further some growth and create jobs. People do not object to this, they object to the manner in which the agreement is negotiated - though this is the standard for virtually all international agreements. And they object to clauses furthering the interest of the economic elite like the investor clause.

It'd be a grave mistake to scrap the whole agreement because of this. Out of the set EU, USA, EFTA, Canada and Mexico it is only the pair of EU and US that does not have a FTA negotiated. Concluding TTIP opens the door to negotiating a FTA between all the mentioned states, a tranatlantic free trade area (TAFTA), compromising about a billion people and a half of the world's GDP and a third of its trade.

true,PsychoPosh,IDF,Ile-de-France,"Alors à propos des tests de QI ; je reste personnellement sceptique quant à ces tests, puisqu'ils posent le problème de la norme, basée sur une courbe de gauss aussi appelée loi normale, qui postule que tout les individus sont rangés de manière régulière sur une courbe de probabilité, avec une moyenne de score à 100 et un écart type de 15. Globalement, ces tests ne sont d'aucune utilité pour les adultes, certains psychos s'en servent quand même quand ils font passer des bilans, mais le test pour adulte (WAIS) est quasiment jamais utilisé, du moins en France. Par contre, ils sont souvent utilisés en psychologie de l'enfant, notamment pour détecter en première intention un retard mental ou au contraire les surdoués. Les informations qu'ils fournissent sont effectivement à manipuler avec une extrême précaution, parce qu'une grille de résultats lue par un non initié peut perdre beaucoup de son sens, on a pas mal été formés là dessus, et même si c'est vraiment lourd à faire c'est nécessaire. C'est la seule utilité légitime qui me vient à l'esprit là maintenant, y'en a peut être d'autres mais pour moi ça reste assez nébuleux de vouloir appliquer de la statistique à de l'humain, c'est à manier avec précaution.

Les tests que j'ai plus appréciés sont le Rorschach et le TAT, mais qui là sont encore plus ""dangereux"" s'ils sont mal utilisés, et sont aussi sujets à controverses. L'idée intéressante avec ces test dits ""projectifs"", c'est qu'ils permettent, en gros, d'analyser la dynamique psychique du patient : le type d'angoisse auquel il a affaire (morcellement, castration, abandon), la manière dont il se représente la différence des sexes, la dynamique familiale, etc. etc. Ces informations recueillies via ces tests n'ont en aucun cas une valeur d'absolu, et ces tests sont toujours effectués dans le cadre d'un suivi, qui apporte d'autres informations par les entretiens. On ne fait pas passer ces tests pour le plaisir, mais bien lorsqu'il y a un but précis, ou un élément à investiguer que l'entretien ne permet pas.
Le Rorschach tout le monde connait, c'est le test des tâches d'encre, où la seule question qui doit être posée est ""qu'est ce que cela pourrait être"".
Le TAT, ce sont des images, des ""planches"" en noir et blanc, sur lesquelles il peut y avoir aucun, un, ou plusieurs personnages, sur un décor (ou pas, il y a même une planche vide) et on demande au patient de raconter une histoire avec un début, un milieu et une fin. Cela permet d'analyser la façon dont le récit est construit, la façon dont interagissent les personnages, leurs relations, sentiments, etc.

Pour finir, la psychopathologie transculturelle ; c'est un dispositif thérapeutique particulier qui s'adresse aux migrants de première ou seconde génération ; le patient vient souvent accompagné de sa famille. (Ça peut faire des entretiens où y'a plus de 10 personnes parfois)
La séance est dirigé par un thérapeute qui est le seul à parler directement au patient et à sa famille, et il est entouré de co-thérapeutes (et parfois d'un interprète) d'origines culturelles différentes, qu'il fait intervenir au fil de la séance. Donc c'est un dispositif assez lourd à mettre en place, qui est particulièrement judicieux quand les problèmes des patients s'ancrent dans des problématiques inter-générationnelles et surtout inter-culturelles ; un exemple de problématique pour un enfant né en France, avec des parents africains, comment construire une identité entre des parents qui vivent à la maison ""comme au pays"" et une identité de jeune, français, qui va à l'école ; ce genre de situation peut donner lieu par exemple à des comportements de mutisme sélectif chez des jeunes enfants, ou des comportements criminels (si on postule que s'y ancre une problématique en l'occurrence identitaire, évidemment).

[Apfelkorn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apfelkorn) is also pretty common here in Germany. 

&gt; Also, I believe I am studying at the Halle-Wittenberg university.

Yes, the Kolleg is operated by the Uni Halle-Wittenberg, however, the Uni is actually completely in Halle. The Uni was created in 1817, when the Uni Halle (founded in 1694) and the Leucorea Wittenberg (founded 1502) were united. 

The preparation courses for exchange students are taught in Wittenber. 

&gt; Since you're so close, I'd like to ask another question. We have studied a bit about the DDR era and Soviet controlled Germany. My instructor told me that there is a good chance that my hosts will have been raised during this time. Is there anything I should be mindful of in relation to this, or has enough time passed that it doesn't matter much?

I don't think there are much issues with that. Some people lost a lot of status and money after 1989 and still are bitter about that, but I doubt those will host a guest student. 

Just be aware that we Germans love to discuss politics. Exchange students are sometimes shocked when the co-eds or hosts want to discuss this stuff, because it's somewhat taboo in some cultures. And we Germans can be very direct ;-)

* *Babylone Babies* et *Les racines du mal* de Maurice G. Dantec: dans la droite ligne des auteurs cyberpunk que tu cites.  Ses derniers bouquins par contre sont...moins abordables et plus spéciaux.

* *La planète des singes* de Pierre Boulle: parce que ça fait toujours bien dans les dîners de rappeler que La Planète des Singes, c'est un roman français à la base ( *Les jeux de l'esprit*, une sorte de Running Man/ Hunger Games du pauvre est amusant aussi à lire du même auteur)

* *Le monde enfin* de Jean-Pierre Andrevon: son côté prêcheur écolo est parfois agaçant, mais c'est un très bon post-apo (*Le Travail du furet* et *Un horizon de cendres* aussi d'Andrevon sont très bons).

* *Les Démons de Paris* de Jean-Philippe Despotte: du steampunk pas neuneu, dans le Paris du début du XXe, avec des communistes, des démons (forcément) et des trucs chelous dans le métro parisien.

* *Françatome* de Johan Heliot : mis à part la fin, j'ai trouvé ça trop court tellement l'uchronie qu'il décrit m'a plu :une France gaulliste autoritaire, devenue première puissance mondiale à l'issue de la guerre grâce à sa maîtrise de l'énergie atomique.

* *Bloodsilver* de Wayne Barrow (c'est une feinte, les auteurs sont français, dont l'un est celui cité ci-dessus): retour sur l'histoire de la conquête de l'Ouest, avec toutes ses figures mythiques, mais avec en plus des vampires qui portent des lunettes de soleil (et un chupacabra si je me rappelle bien)..


* *Qu'ils s'en aillent tous* de Jean-Luc Mélenchon: un regard original sur l'éternelle lutte des forces du bien contre le mal absolu , dans le cadre d'une France alternative. De façon très intelligente, l'auteur critique implicitement le manichéisme ambiant en nous présentant un narrateur émotionnellement instable, porteur d'une vision eschatologique et parfois grotesque sur le monde qui l'entoure.

The first documents which were written in what was more a new language Latin-influenced than a bastardized Latin dates at about the IX century, if I can recall correctly. 

I think we are around 400-500 years needed to fade away. (of course the Latin spoken in the very last years of the Empire was already somewhat different than the ""classical"" one)

Obviously as a cultural language it needed way more time to fade away. It was the main language for scientific and philosophy books until the end of the 18th century, and the Catholic Mass was held in Latin until 1969. 

The funny thing is that officially latin has *never* faded away. It is still now the official language of the Holy See, which is a recognized sovereing state. They actually publish a public journal in latin, use it in official documents (Pope Benedict announced for the very first time his retirement in a speech he was holding in Latin!) and I heard that they have an ATM which have Latin as one of the languages (I should go checking, at least if it is in St. Peter Square).",0,1399414821,null,0,1399415077,0,chbbiho,t3_24uogq,t1_chbbiho,t1_chaw2yf,null,1433681290,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2
