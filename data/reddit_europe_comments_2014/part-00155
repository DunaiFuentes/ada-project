There are some becas, research grants and assistantships, but none for non-EU foreign students (you could try to get a Fulbright). The cost of a degree here is still much less than the cost of one in the US (even though it has gone up astronomically in the past few years). For example, tuition for a Master's in International Relations costs around 4000 euros if you complete everything in one year.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; Who's ever claimed that it would be?

Um, a lot of people, mostly politicians that purposefully misinterpreted the original Reinhart and Rogoff study. The original study only showed that there was a correlation between the two and made a few suggestions about the direction of the causation, mostly focusing on high debt =&gt; low growth. Certain politicians loved this and I can personally remember Merkel citing this result on numerous occasions as proof for her austerity and fiscal discipline policies. That kept happening even after the controversy with that study, by the way. 

&gt; If Greece would be used as a simple example we could make the case that once a governments ability to roll its debt diminishes civil unrest and political deadlock will follow. This will further increase the cost of borrowing and deepen the crisis. If the governments debt is below, say 90 %, its ability to act within the financial market is much greater. Even when sudden changes emerge in the global or domestic economy.

This is just a qualitative interpretation of the correlation. If the factors you outlined were the mechanism by which the process worked, this would leave evidence in the data and the study would find it. The fact that it didn't means that either the mechanism you describe does not have an impact on growth or that there are other mechanism that counteract it (or that the methodology used in the study is not so good at finding the direction of causation). 

However, within the confines of the scientific process, this is as close evidence as you can get that telling countries to not go into debt because it will slow their growth is wrong. (Obviously, that doesn't mean that all countries should start borrowing like there is no tomorrow.)

&gt; Arguing that this study finds that sovereign debt is not harmful to growth, is not only wrong but very narrow minded; it's merely a conclusion based on data that cannot take into account the full complexity of a government in an economic crisis.

You seem to not understand what the study is saying or how this works. The fact that you can present a qualitative story that is inconsistent with the result does not invalidate the study. Anyone can come up with any number of qualitative interpretations for any data. Your interpretation does not even fit the data, so what exactly is your point here? 

&gt; It merely shows that the results of this study do not support the claims.

This is just wrong. The phrasing is just an academic way of saying ""we ran our experiments and this is the result we got"". It in no way means that if you run a similar study with a different methodology they fully expect you to get a different result. 

In conclusion: You don't understand how science works and you just want to rationalise your ideological disagreement with the results. ",0,1401581770,null,0,1401583705,0,chw0wvx,t3_26yxbd,t1_chw0wvx,t1_chvtja3,null,1434039515,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

You don't seem to understand the study when making a claim that this proves anything. Nowhere did I say it invalidates the study either. Don't put words in my mouth.

&gt; Your interpretation does not even fit the data, so what exactly is your point here?

I didn't interpret anything I merely said that this study doesn't show anything of the kind you said it did. I also put forward the weaknesses of this study in its try to answer the question which it sets out to answer. 

&gt;This is just wrong. The phrasing is just an academic way of saying ""we ran our experiments and this is the result we got"".

You don't need to explain research to me I've got a degree. And it says that ""the claim that debt is harmful for growth is not supported by our results.""

What I say is that a quantitative study, on its own, cannot explain a complex phenomenon as this. So the topic for this post is fundamentally wrong.

&gt; Conclusion:

&gt; Based on a simple VAR analysis with panel data, we can conclude that there is little evidence for a negative long-run effect of sovereign debt on economic growth. Our findings are consistent with recent studies applying different methods, such as Panizza and Presbitero (2013), as well as Kimball and Wang (2013) who “could not find even a shred of evidence in the Reinhart and Rogoff data for a negative effect of government debt on growth”.

&gt; Using the negative correlation between debt and growth as a justification for austerity policies could be another example of confusing correlation with causation.

This is however limiting freedom. Saying people cannot own stuff is terrible.

[Read up.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticisms_of_Marxism)

&gt; Reducing/Eliminating exploitation of third world countries(Currently increasing as a result of Capitalism)

No. These countries which are exploited are so because they are bad at economics or don't care about their people. One could argue saying first world countries are sucking third world nations of resources however they would do so regardless of ideology.

&gt; Stopping destruction of the enviornment(Currently ignored under Capitalism)

Because countries like China and Russia are totally 100% completely green. You're so ignorant and like to just point fingers at others.

&gt; Paying workers what they're worth, either through reformation of the wage labour system or abolition of corporate hierarchy with the introduction of worker's cooperatives(A system proven to be effective). Capitalism by nature does not do or encourage any of this.

Capitalism is exactly what's doing this. You need to understand the fundamental principles of capitalism to be able to comprehend why. Capitalism assumes competition and unbiased law making.

&gt; Equal rights for all, regardless of social class, employment or race, gender, and religion.

Because the law makers or politicians for instance would definitely not get special treatment?

Wow, just wow.

Nice wiki page bro, if I spam you with them does that make me automatically right?

&gt;Because countries like China and Russia are totally 100% completely green. You're so ignorant and like to just point fingers at others.

Where has country even come into this? Both Russian and China are Capitalist states.

&gt;Capitalism is exactly what's doing this.

No it absolutely is not. Capitalism is in no way;

* Paying workers what they are worth. In order for Capitalists to make a profit they cannot pay workers the value of their productivity. This is a fundamental fact.

* It is not reforming the system, and actively campaigns against any and all infringements on its exploitation of the workers.

* It is not abolishing corporate hierarchy. 

* It is not introducing worker's cooperatives, and coops are Socialist by nature.

&gt;Capitalism assumes competition and unbiased law making.

That would be quite a lovely race to the bottom. If you think Socialism is a laugh, Anarcho-Capitalism is the biggest joke in the ideological book with absolutely zero basis in reality.

&gt;Because the law makers or politicians for instance would definitely not get special treatment?

No. Why would they? If a politician committed a crime, he'd get the same punishment as the dock worker does, not to mention the prestige of law makers is dramatically reduced given that all important decisions are made via direct democracy.

&gt;Are you trolling?

Great response. So you have nothing to say about how all the capital is gravitating towards the same organizations? This is the pretty basic concept of ""the 1%"", though that's hardly extreme enough, it's more the 0.1% owning everything.

&gt;Communism is good on paper but bad in practice.

Totally unsubstantiated claim.

People argue that power will become the new currency.

Do you seriously believe that or are you just being plain stupid?

&gt; Paying workers what they are worth. In order for Capitalists to make a profit they cannot pay workers the value of their productivity. This is a fundamental fact.

They are paid what their market value is.

&gt; It is not abolishing corporate hierarchy.

It could be with some change, but abolishment of the concept is silly. Besides corporations cannot be run by people who aren't educated in the field.

&gt; It is not introducing worker's cooperatives, and coops are Socialist by nature.

It is, but it depends on the market.

&gt; If you think Socialism is a laugh, Anarcho-Capitalism is the biggest joke in the ideological book with absolutely zero basis in reality.

Of course it is. I said above that black and white reasoning is silly. Saying one ideology is at fault for everything in the world is ignorant. Putting extremes and saying ""well this **type** of capitalism has setbacks"" makes it seem like you're trying to put words in my mouth. I don't care for capitalism nor communism because they are both fundamentally faulty.

&gt; No. Why would they?

If there is no difference in money there is difference in power.

&gt; If a politician committed a crime, he'd get the same punishment as the dock worker does, not to mention the prestige of law makers is dramatically reduced given that all important decisions are made via direct democracy.

No he wouldn't. For one even communism has different degrees of pay. A doctor earns more than a construction worker for instance. For two if he can't bribe an officer with money he could do so with power - perhaps giving him a better job, or more resources at his disposal.

&gt; Great response. So you have nothing to say about how all the capital is gravitating towards the same organizations? 

I do. Read above where I said ""Both on their own are stupid but if you mix them you've a better society."". You're the one putting extremes and saying ""all capitalists must die"" or some shit.

**edit** I was on my phone earlier, let me expand on this:

You probably know Cameron doesn't control a single party government in the UK - he's in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. The Lib Dems are against holding a referendum right now, for what they see as reasons entirely to do with internal Conservative party politics. This means that even if he wanted to (he probably does), he couldn't hold a referendum before 2015 when the next election is, and only if he controls a single party government. That's why he promises a referendum with single party government as a condition to it - it happens to be convenient, as he obviously wants a single party government anyway, rather than people splitting the (as it was seen at the time of his promise) Conservative vote with UKIP.

Quei ragazzi avevano allora 17 anni, ma sono rimasto stupito dal casino che facevano. Non quelli che conoscevo, che eran tranquilli, ma quasi il 70% della classe che urlava, scriveva sui banchi, provava a accendersi una sigaretta di nascosto alla finestra dell'aula... 

Sebbene i giovani siano coglioni anche in Canada, a scuola non ho mai visto un atteggiamento del genere, o almeno non è mai durato più di un minuto o due. 

Poi sono stati sui treni scolastici dalla Campania fino al Trentino e dapertutto, quello che sempre mi ha colpito è la MALEDUCAZIONE dei ragazzi sui treni. Gridare così non ha senso, eh. Ma di calmi ce ne sono pochissimi... La maggior parte fanno un casino insensato. Piedi sui sedili, corse nel corridoio, parolacce in numero infinite, prese in giro degli altri passeggeri, oggetti lanciati dai finestrini, insomma........ Nei miei 5 anni di superiori in Canada non ho mai visto un gruppo agire così su un mezzo pubblico.

&gt;I am sure that magicly Ukrainian financial issues will be lightened.
This is the usual US way of winning countries from the Russian sphere of influence : make the country sink in debt, teach students how to fight corrupted governments, send the IMF to make the people angry against the government that still steal funds while cutting welfare to please the IMF, the pro-western students then overthrow the government, and debt pressure is lowered in exchange of opening of the market to foreigners and cutting ties with Russia.
They will still sink in debt, but they will be less pressured (for now, the IMF will come back in a few years).

true,EmperorZIZ,EURO,Belgium likes no war neigbours,"Well, from my understanding, it's a combination of factors:  why i think some want to leave the union:

- the UK gives more money to the EU than it receives, and see that as either a waist, or feel that they are not appreciated enough for it (mostly the first i think)

- The feeling that immigration is uncontrolled due to the EU, which allows immigrants to either take jobs or get free welware in the UK.

- The restriction of trade: UK cannot handle with non-EU countries at will because of regulation standards (i presume, not really that familiar on the subject). UKIP wants to hold the free-trade-agreement with the EU, but the liberty to trade with other partners across the world (commonwealth countries, most likely)

- for those who are interested in EU-politics, there is a significant part of the population that doesn't feel that EU has the UK's best interest in mind (mostly germany gets pointed out here)

- the democratic deficit: a significant part of the european bureaucrats are unelected, which is quite unpopular thing.

- political union: europe is getting more and more powers, certainly since the beginning of the crisis. This is seen as a loss of sovereignity. Given the fact that the EU has made mistakes in countering the crisis, makes it even worse

- grudges: a lot of grudges on both sides, which some people really can't get over with

pro-EU-arguments:

- For a free-Trade agreement (which is vital to the UK economy), they'll have to pay into the EU budget and correspond to their laws (like Norway).

At least on the pragmatical level, ideologically, they will be independent

- no influence in the future of the EU: mayebe the EU will fall apart, mayebe it won't. I guess it will be resilient. Any way, today, the UK is (or was, before the elections) a big factor in the EP and in the commission. When they are out, it's impossible for them to have any influence in the decisiontaking, even if they think that influence was small.

- Possible little hit on the economy: i'm no expert, but a few banks have talked about leaving the city of London when the UK leaves the EU. That could hurt a bit, although Britains economy is on the rise, so i don't know. (sidenote: this can be used as an argument against the EU, because they are seen sometimes as an instrument of banks and big business)

- departure of scotland: i know veeeery little about the consequences of this, but scotland really wants to remain into the EU. It is possible that, if the UK leaves, they will want to leace (only relevant to the UK-loving Brits)

As opposed to NATO countries or Korea, they maintain *two* webs of alliances and contribute to their defense. Most NATO countries have not committed to defend South Korea, Japan or Taiwan, and likewise Japan is certainly not obliged to help NATO in the case of an invasion from e.g., Russia. Moreover, the numbers given include the Iraq war, something that has no international mandate and is not a NATO operation. That's an American problem and if America ends up spending money on it, not our problem. We voted against it.

Only two NATO countries maintain nuclear arsenals, and the other nations are actually obliged by treaty not to do so. Same goes for power projections measures, like overseas bases and aircraft carriers: Bases in Qatar or Diego Garcia are certainly not helping much in defending the NATO treaty territory. 

Don't get me wrong, western Europe certainly has benefited from the US defense umbrella (which I am thankful for).

Ricordo il giorno, in IV ginnasio, in cui l'insegnante di lettere entrò in aula sconvolta dicendoci ""è accaduto un fatto gravissimo."" 

Ricordo che percepivamo questa insegnante come persona coltissima, onesta, priva di superbia, e che ovviamente la adoravamo. Era del PCI e cattolica, e ci disse che le BR avevano rapito l'uomo politico che stava realizzando un progetto che avrebbe permesso al PCI di arrivare al governo del Paese. 

È ovvio che l'aspetto terribile consisteva, per lei, nel vedere un processo democratico arrestato con gli strumenti del terrore, e peggio ancora usando un linguaggio che era la caricatura della cultura di sinistra. 

Poi, chiaramente, l'atrocità dell'esecuzione ha travolto qualsiasi ragionamento politico. 

Quindi, riassumendo, noi ragazzotti di ultrasinistra dura-e-pura pensavamo che eravamo contrari alle BR ma che Moro era comunque un democristiano dimmerda. Eravamo dei gran fighi, si. Il PCI di allora, invece, vedeva la cosa in una prospettiva più ampia, e quindi in tutto quello che ora capisco esserne l'autentico orrore: una commedia atroce destinata a controllare la vita pubblica di un Paese intero e realizzata spegnendo a freddo vite umane come necessario artificio scenico.

Thus, as the debate regarding the EU intensifies within the UK, support for an EU exit actually *drops*. By that point people are forced to no longer threat the EU as a remote scapegoat but actually look up the facts regarding a decision they might be forced to eventually take. Consequently, the myths are separated from the facts and the EU is found to be more complex than a *monolithic, continental Eurocrat-bureaucracy that wants to ban the British sausage*.

The National Security Agency is harvesting huge numbers of images of people from communications that it intercepts through its global surveillance operations for use in sophisticated facial recognition programs, according to top-secret documents.

...

 
“It’s not just the traditional communications we’re after: It’s taking a full-arsenal approach that digitally exploits the clues a target leaves behind in their regular activities on the net to compile biographic and biometric information” that can help “implement precision targeting,” noted a 2010 document.

...
 

The agency has created teams of “identity intelligence” analysts 

...
 

[The agency] intercepts video teleconferences to obtain facial imagery, gathers airline passenger data and collects photographs from national identity card databases created by foreign countries, the documents show. 

...

The documents suggest that the agency has considered getting access to iris scans through its phone and email surveillance programs.

...
 

The documents also indicate that the N.S.A. collects iris scans of foreigners through other means.

...
 
One of the N.S.A.’s broadest efforts to obtain facial images is a program called Wellspring, which strips out images from emails and other communications, and displays those that might contain passport images.

...

The N.S.A. can now compare spy satellite photographs with intercepted personal photographs taken outdoors to determine the location. ",0,1401616327,null,0,false,0,chwah54,t3_270qlw,t1_chwah54,t3_270qlw,null,1434044156,5,false,de,t5_22i0,5

If you are in Nuremberg, go to Bamberg, it's 30 min north of Nuremberg by train and it's beautiful, historic and unesco world heritage for a reason. 

Also if you absolutely want to go to Rothenburg, make sure to take a small walk down into the valley of the tauber river. I'd suggest to go to [Dinkelsbühl](https://www.google.de/search?q=Dinkelsb%C3%BChl&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=UWj&amp;rls=org.mozilla:de:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EviKU8riJKW07QaL5oGAAw&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667), it's quite close to Rothenburg and as nice but not so exremely touristic (you'll mostly have americans and chinese people in Rothenburg).

My tips for Nuremberg and Bamberg:

**Nürnberg:**
Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.

* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.

* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)

* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.

* [Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!

* In the [Handwerkerhof](http://www.handwerkerhof.de/en/home.html) you can see how craftsmen create tradtitional products from the area in an medivial environment.

* Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 

* [Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp;amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp;amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.

* [Neues Museum Nürnberg](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neues_Museum_N%C3%BCrnberg) has a great collection of modern and contemporary art and design, for example Andy Warhol.

* [Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 

* [Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing

* In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!

* Nürnberg has a soccer team and a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

* ADIDAS and PUMA have their headquarters and big outlet shopping centres in the small town of Herzogenaurach, 25km north-west of Nuremberg. If you want to go shopping for cheap sportswear (and more), you should consider a visit. Also if you are interested in [modern](http://www.vb.com/puma/puma-hq-herzogenaurach-m.jpg) [architecture](http://www.herzogenaurach.de/typo3temp/pics/e9cc906d7d.jpg).

**Bamberg:**

* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  

* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.

* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the [""Alte Hofhaltung""](http://www.emiksch.de/Lions/2007/Bilder/slides/Bamberg_Alte_Hofhaltung.jpg) where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)

* The [Altenburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Altenburg_von_S%C3%BCden_14-09-2003_%283%29.JPG) is towering above Bamberg and you have a great view from there.

* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""

* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above

* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.

* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.

* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18) as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.spezial-keller.de/index_files/stacks_image_44.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.

* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;amp;num=30&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=de&amp;amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;radius=15000&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.

* Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

* Bamberg is a University Town with currently about 12k Students (at 70k people), so you'll find young people everywhere.

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recommend ""Schäuferla"" :)

There's also a more general sentiment that Britain used to be the most powerful country in the world and now we're taking orders from *Germans?* People don't like the idea of it, despite the fact they're hardly orders (and it's not even necessarily the Germans) and we're certainly not the power we used to be. As another commenter said, Britain doesn't feel like Europe, due to it being an island and being at war with most of the continent since forever, and in general little culture differences. We also share our language with the US so there's a weird sort of thinking there that we should team up with them because of all their tanks and guns and stuff, rather than with the EU who seem primarily concerned with blustering about and trying to make us use the Euro. I have absolutely no idea whether we're better off with the pound economically, but I've never met anyone who would like the Euro, and their reasoning is ""it isn't British!"" Personally the only difference it would have on my day to day life is making exchange rates easier, 1€=1€, and it would save hassle when I went on holiday. I don't know if other countries were this upset about losing the Frank and the Deutschmark or not but we've got a bit of a thing about the pound.

Worship the Norse gods, pray to them, etc.

Worshiping and praying usually involved a sacrifice of some sort, from a candle, to mead and cooked food and raw meat.  
I had an three altars:   
One to Freya, goddess of beauty, luck, and love. 
One to Thor, the thundergod, protector of the mortal world, god of drivers.   
And the last one to Odin the Allfather, the One-Eyed Wanderer, god of magic, of victory, of nobility, of wisdom, poetry, and rage, of ecstasy and pain, the father of all the gods, the one who first brought war in the world, the one who gave his eye to receive wisdom, the one that brought humanity the mighty runes through sacrificing himself to himself.   

You'll be able to figure out which I revere the most.    

As for what I believe: Just read the Poetic Edda, it's a good read even if you don't believe it. The [Völuspa](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe03.htm#page_1) part explains the beginning and end of the world and the gods.

Nowadays, it's changed a bit.  
I believe in all gods now, even the all-encompassing Christian one, just a bit differently.  
I've added altars to Hermes and Saint Cyprian and plan on adding Marduk soon.

That's a ridiculous point to make because the mechanism about how much you get from the budget is the same for every country.  In fact because of the UK discount the French have to pay extra to make up for what you pay less.

&gt; You need to look at the net figures. France and the UK are roughly equal.

How are you comparing numbers?  If the discount would not exist numbers could be actually compared.  Currently that's absolutely impossible to do because of the imbalanced caused by it.

But yes: the UK should pay more than France and not less.  What you get back from the pot should not matter because that's something that can be managed on a year by year basis.

**Moro** - Se Aldo Moro fosse serenamente morto di vecchiaia, oggi verrebbe ricordato come gran culopiatto democristo, pioniere della casta e maneggione anzichenò. L'immagine - oggi diventata incontestabile - di illuminato statista padre nobile dell'Ulivo è figlia di una lettura post-rapimento funzionale alla creazione (a quel punto ne avevano interesse sia democristiani sia comunisti) del mito di Moro in chiave apologetica. A Moro vivo, le cose stavano diversamente: Moro, infatti, era il campione della conservazione del potere democristiano: mai andato oltre il 7% (al punto che non si capiva nemmeno bene che corrente fosse la sua, e ci si riduceva a chiamarli morotei per disperazione) eppure nel partito non si muoveva foglia che lui non volesse. In nome della convenienza per la Dc (che poi voleva dire la convenienza per se stesso) era in grado di fare qualsiasi cosa: accoltellare gli amici di partito alle spalle (ad esempio congresso del '59 col povero Fanfani che va a dormire da vincitore sicuro e si sveglia la mattina dopo che Moro gli ha fatto lo scherzo e vincono i dorotei), imbarcarsi in operazioni spregiudicate (tipo nel '74 quando c'è da andare a perdere il referendum sul divorzio perché il Papa ha deciso di incaponircisi e mezza Dc - compresi insospettati baciapile - vuole ribellarsi al Vaticano e Moro è l'unico a capire che sarebbe un errore e porta a mani nude il partito dalla sua parte), portare i comunisti al governo. Argomento con cui veniamo al famoso compromesso storico. Ora, la storiella che ci raccontano oggi del compromesso storico come straordinario ed avanzato prodotto della straordinaria ed avanzata mente di Moro che aveva capito come il compagno Berlinguer avesse ragione su un sacco di cose e come fosse pertanto necessario imprimere la salvifica svolta a sinistra all'Italia è un mucchio di cazzate: che fulminazione comunista potrà mai avere uno degli inventori di Gladio? Il compromesso storico nasce come operazione tesa alla salvaguardia della centralità del potere democristiano. E' la riproposizione dello schema Fanfani di quindici anni prima, solo col Pci al posto del Psi. Come allora, l'operazione nasce dalla presa d'atto che a sinistra della Dc (e dei laici minori, che oggi come allora non servono mai a un cazzo) c'è una forza con molti voti e che è più conveniente governare inglobando quella forza piuttosto che mettendocisi contro. Allo stesso modo con cui si erano inglobati i socialisti nei primi '60 (due concessioni di bandiera sul programma e prospettiva un giorno di fare il centrosinistra organico), si procede dunque ad inglobare i comunisti (giova ricordare che il famoso governo che doveva prendere la fiducia il 16 marzo era un monocolore Dc con l'astensione del Pci e che il Pci aveva avuto voce in capitolo solo nella scelta del premier, ed aveva scelto Andreotti perché di Moro non ci si fidava fino in fondo). Con questo nessuno sta dicendo che Moro non sia stato un bravo politico. Al contrario, lo è stato ma per ragioni diametralmente opposte a quelle che la vulgata gli ha costruito addosso.

**Berlinguer** - Enrico Berlinguer è stato, semplicemente, il peggior segretario di partito dell'Italia repubblicana (potrebbe giocarsela con Martinazzoli, ma sarebbe ingeneroso per via delle condizioni ambientali). Analogamente a quanto successo con Moro, però, di Berlinguer oggi abbiamo una lettura prossima all'oleografia dove la storia scompare per fare posto a tratti caratteriali (""Era onesto!"", ""Era una brava persona!"") che con la politica non c'entrano niente e che servono solo a costruire un'immagine da santino col compito di irradiare luce sugli eredi (i quali avevano bisogno di accreditarsi come occupanti del lato giusto della storia, e per far passare il concetto decretare la santità del capostipite ha aiutato). Questo ha portato nei casi migliori alla distorsione della realtà: esempio classico il famoso ""strappo con Mosca"", che oggi viene fatto passare per una specie di rivoluzione socialdemocratica e nessuno che ricordi che, a dare retta a Berlinguer, la rivoluzione d'ottobre aveva perso sì la spinta propulsiva, ma per fare posto all'eurocomunismo (che si è vista la fortuna che ha avuto). Nei casi peggiori, però, ha portato alla rimozione della realtà. Alcuni risvolti sono comici: sparisce il Berlinguer trombone e bacchettone, quello che firma scritti sulla superiore moralità delle fanciulle sovietiche che giungono illibate al matrimonio (e che, coerentemente, quando c'è da schierarsi sul referendum del divorzio dovrà essere tirato per i capelli dalla parte vincente perché a lui l'idea che il divorzio fosse roba da borghesi non gliela levava nessuno) e quello che impegnerà il partito nella battaglia di assoluta avanguardia contro l'introduzione della tv a colori che distrae la classe lavoratrice. Altri risvolti però sono drammatici. Perché sparisce anche l'errore politico più grosso di Berlinguer, senza tenere conto del quale non si può capire nulla di Berlinguer. L'errore in questione è quello compiuto a partire dalla metà degli anni '70 e consistito nel non essere stato in grado di intercettare il settore di popolazione naturalmente inclinato a dare ricambio (generazionale, culturale, professionale eccetera) al partito e di essersi chiuso a riccio in una difesa senza senso dello status quo il cui frutto, alla fine, è stato gettare le basi per trent'anni di opposizione. Arroccato sul sacro schema delle due società, Berlinguer punta tutto (ancora, perché dai fallimenti degli altri è vietato imparare) sull'alleanza intellettuali-ceti produttivi. Risultato: la centralità operaia viene meno, gli intellettuali continuano a farsi i cazzi loro e nel frattempo i non garantiti - finiti di prendersi gli ultimi insulti - salutano e prendono altre strade (Bettino ringrazia). Detto questo, possiamo finalmente arrivare alla madre di tutte le questioni berlingueriane: l'austerità. Che è la risposta identitario-tribale che Berlinguer fornisce alla comunità quando le conseguenze dell'errore di cui sopra iniziano a manifestarsi e si avvia la marginalizzazione del Pci. Lo schema - di pura autodifesa - dentro cui i comunisti sono chiamati a leggere la realtà diventa quello del ""ci tengono fuori perché siamo gli unici onesti e per questo temuti"". Da cui il mito dell'austerità, che in una botta sola rispolvera  certe suggestioni leniniste (che in uno della generazione di Berlinguer erano forti, al punto da impedirgli di capire che il resto del mondo per sua fortuna non ne aveva) da gagliardo pauperismo antitetico alle mollezze borghesi e le innesta sulla compressione del potere d'acquisto che inizia ad essere in atto nella constituency del Pci, cui viene detto che se si sta impoverendo non è colpa sua ma di tutti gli altri che rubano. L'intento assolutorio ed autoconsolatorio della teoria è evidente, così come lo sono le conseguenze: si accredita (o, meglio, si riaccredita in forme nuove) il discorso della diversità antropologica (e quando Grillo dice di essere l'erede di Berlinguer non dice una cazzata); si avvia la deriva manettara; ci si chiude alla modernità. Spiace metterla così, ma Berlinguer resta quello che per vincere un'elezione è dovuto morire.",0,1401616891,null,0,false,0,chwajyp,t3_26zzj9,t1_chwajyp,t3_26zzj9,null,1434044194,32,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,32

The inherent assault on competition within the EU's own single market.  The ECB,  or even go on the attack of individual politicians, how they are appointed/elected and why it favours mediocrity.  

I won't.

I'll address specific policy issues by cobbling together some of my own old posts and adding to them.


**AGRICULTURE:**

European economies are not the same.  When half the EU budget goes towards CAP, and yet when the UK has some of the largest, most efficient farms, but obviously fewer of them in total number, the CAP doesn't represent UK farms for the better, but allows continental farms to close the gap.  The Scottish forced information using the freedom of information act.  They found that corporations like Nestle and Tate&amp;Lyle had received billions over the last decade, whilst the average Scottish farmer had only received £9,000 per annum.   Why are we subsidising huge corporations that already turn massive profits?  From the UK perspective the UK wants to be able to take nothing from CAP and, if subsidies are necessary, to be able to tailor them for their own needs, to the most deserving, out of their *own* pocket.

**FISHING:**

 People are all too fond of reminding the UK that they're an island on the corner of Europe.  That also means we have a massive amount of coastline for our size and we have a large sea on one side and a large ocean on the other.  When the Spanish joined the CFP the size of the European shipping fleet doubled in size.  For 30 years since the UK, and conservationists, have argued constantly for meaningful reform.  Every year 800,000 tonnes of fish are dumped back into British waters (British under international maritime law), dead, because of policy which has turned out to be impossible to reform.  Completely counter productive to economy and conservation.  Being an island this hits the UK disproportionately hard.  Dropping out of the CFP would provide the UK with an extra £2.5bn a year before counting the extra costs of bureaucracy attached to managing the CFP; preserving a dying industry, removing some of the most harmful practices in UK waters, stopping over fishing through the numbers of ships, and providing a huge boon to conservation.   That's not to say that the CFP couldn't continue on its own without the UK, but after 30 years, and a decade review last year which delivered nothing meaningful, the UK is being hardest hit, and continues to be so.

**TRADE:**

To address the UK's need for a trade commissioner.   The UK economy is unique to Europe.  Just as the economy differs greatly between North and South Europe, the UK in turn differs from the North with far more emphasis on finance and services.  This means that when an EU trade commissioner goes on an overseas delegation on behalf of the whole EU, the UK's needs are not indicative.  When the EU sent a delegation to India, India specifically had one thing on its bucket list: financial services.  The UK had one thing on its bucket list: financial services.  The Indians and UK were frustrated and manacled to negotiating around textiles and farming *for months*.  Are we expected to believe an EU commissioner best represents UK financial services when the UK, along with the Czech Republic, were the only two states which refused the EU fiscal compact?  

The UK doesn't *need* to be part of a large trading bloc, although it can still be part of that bloc and expect those trading through it with Europe to meet all the EU requirements, because of what its products are. We don't need to intimidate China to get a great deal any more than Germany needs to intimidate South America to get them to drive German cars.  They want high end machinery designed to make cheap low end products - they come to the UK.  If they want to extenuate a global footprint in finance, it's London.  They want high end innovation, financial services and banking, top grade pharmaceuticals and chemicals.  We don't need the EU to help sell these.  We also shouldn't need the EU to trade with countries whom we share a Head Of State with!  It's not an argument of empire.  The commonwealth is built on recognising full sovereignty of others.  It's just that through a fluke of history we find ourselves with a shared language, culture and history outside the EU, as well as having links to the EU, and going through the EU doesn't help the UK in these matters e.g.  Switzerland should not be able to negotiate a free trade agreement with Canada faster than the UK.

**POLITICAL INTEGRATION/FEDERALISM:**

Then there's the matter of Federalism.

In 1975 Edward Heath said,
 
           ""Fears that we shall in some way lose sovereignty or
            independence are, I need hardly say, completely 
            unjustified.""

That is how the UK voted.  They never wanted political unity or judicial courts.  For almost 40 years now it's small wonder that the UK has grown increasingly concerned.  They've even been arguing for this debate since 1992 and Maastricht.  Every time they secure opt outs and vetoes, legally **and which others agree to**, and then are harassed when they choose to exercise them.

**THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE:**

The ECJ told employers that if their employee gets sick on paid vacation time it was not the private insurance or travel policy but the EMPLOYER's job to compensate them. Paid vacation is one thing. Paid vacation and then paying them again if they had a bad experience when on holiday: it's madness. It's widely open to corruption and being taken advantage of. A company has to work around to make sure they can provide them the relevant time off, pay them paid holiday leave, and rightly so, even sick leave, but then be hit for another bill or extra time off because they were sick when they weren't supposed to be in work, and now they want a second holiday?! It's economic disaster in the making, especially for the little guy.

The ECJ driving a stake into small and medium sized businesses and employment figures. A ruling made by a judge with no knowledge of existing UK sovereign law.  They even recently ruled that airlines had to cover expenses of people delayed even when through no fault of the airline, and that UK insurance companies couldn't evaluate risk and set policies around gender.   The ECJ ruling increased some young women driver's insurance costs by up to 25% overnight. The ECJ should not be involving itself in private pension risk assessment; especially when it's (a) punishing the consumer, and (b) negatively affecting those that should be the statistically cheaper to insure.

North Africa and the Middle East are on the med, both locations being the major conflict areas in the world at the moment as well as the source of all those immigrant scallywags on boats.

It might make it easier for an opposition alliance to be formed because the rest of the parties are EPP. There are negotiations for a merger, probably after the presidential elections in November, between PNL and PDL and maybe FC or PMP might be absorbed later. Some liberals said that ALDE has too many leftleaning parties. The new PNL-PDL party will be wear PNL's name, logo, everything.

I don't excuse any individual's behaviour; for example, this man should still be tried as a murder and face the consequence. The point is that people generalise this man's behaviour, but society does bear some of the responsibility for environment that breeds radicalism and a sense of isolation from society.  

&gt; And on top of that, if when they DO face discrimination, they have organizations and authorities to turn to that will give them recourse. I don't know about Sweden, but here at least, anti-discrimination laws are upheld and organizations are vigilant about it - as they should be.

Yes, but it's not really your (or my) place to evaluated the relatively ""hardness"" of discrimination another minority faces.  The point is that, unlike someone who is not discriminated against, they have to look to a group for recourse.  Things that happen easily for others are a fight for them.

&gt; Their upbringing has taught them it's wrong when it happens to them. Seriously, take France, there is a shocking amount of Arab-on-Black racism, Black-on-Arab, Black-on-Asian... 

Actually, anthropologically speaking, minorities OFTEN oppress each other, often in order to attempt to place themselves higher in a hierarchy establish not by them, but by the majority who oppress all those groups.

I don't see it as ""stronger"".  As I said, there are multiple to interpret the word into concrete terms.  A common rhetorical device would be to interpret in a way I didn't mean purposely, so I wanted to clarify. There are multiple ways to oppress people, but the more visceral images that it can provoke don't apply here, and saying that to dismiss ""oppression"" would be the dishonest thing to do.  It doesn't lessen the truth of the outcome, which is that people's ability to exercise their free will in a way given to others is being limited by the use of authority and power.

If you'd said ""Study **suggests** that sovereign debt **may not be** harmful for growth"" I would agree.

A newspaper, usually a tabloid, half makes up a story, usually something which has some truth, but is overembelished.

Someone reads this story, and they think 'this is a shitty law'.

They don't say 'the European government is rubbish, we want something else', they say 'why is it even the case that these laws are being made in another country'. 

They have that attitude for a number of reasons:

* Simple lack of knowledge of the principles of the EU, and the limits of its power - 'if they can make this law, what else can they do?' There is not much public knowledge about freedom of movement, the single market etc, and of course much of the issue is incredibly complicated. It's not clear to anyone barring constitutional lawyers where the formal limits of jurisdiction lie.

* A complete absense of a progressive concept of the European project - Britain is a country, and it has no belief that Europe is the inevitable future, or that nation states are 'on the wrong side of history'. Or, at least, this is a faintly scandalous opinion that is not even common among pro European groups. Europe must justify itself as enhancing the nation state, not on any other terms.

So there is no constitutional fallback, as there might be in Greece or Spain - where you might say 'we don't like how the EU is run, but it is our future, and we must fight to change it'.

Pro-Europeans (like myself) make their arguments on two fronts i) Europe is good for Britain in a completely pragmatic way ii) Europe has no ambitions to usurp national sovereignty. And both are subject to argument, the first because it's easy to get trapped defending everything from Brussels, and also, debating EU laws quickly becomes very complicated, and a matter of 'he said, she said', the second because there are a lot of people in Brussels that do actually advocate a United States of Europe, or something along those lines, which would clearly impede national sovereignty. i.e. that is a serious opinion in Brussels, and unfortunately can't just be portrayed as the feverish dream of a Daily Mail copyeditor.",0,1401622461,null,0,1401623481,0,chwbcll,t3_270o6i,t1_chwbcll,t3_270o6i,null,1434044570,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

I used ""finds"", not ""shows"". That was their finding. And adding ""may not be"" would make the point seem considerably weaker than it really is. I never said ""proves beyond any doubt"" or anything of the sort. It was a claim that was made so that it was not too bold but not too weak at the same time. 

&gt; No I'm just pointing out that your title is miss leading. I also question the applicability of these results in explaining an economic phenomenon which is a broader discussion on how economics should be studied and which by the way also is an ongoing debate within the study of economics. 

But that could apply to all studies in economics where mathematic modelling is involved because the modelling makes unreasonable assumptions. And it could also equally apply very well to all studies that are qualitative and ""political-economics"" because then they don't have any hard data to back up their claims. I'm not going to summarise all the intricacies and debates of an entire scientific field in my submission title on /r/europe...

If an entire field is not as much of a hard science as most people assume, maybe it *is* right to always title claims made within that field in a weaker way in order to not mislead anyone into thinking it's an open and shut case.

My point is not to counteract the responsibility of the individual.  This thread was about trends developing within a group.  My point is that *part* of what causes these trends to develop is the marginalisation that people justify by citing the behaviour that they have a role in fostering.  And what, you may ask, is the purpose of pointing that out? Well, that by setting aside such prejudices and trying to reach out to these people, which obviously seems counterintuitive to many, this problem can be mitigated instead of encouraged.

- Cade completamente la foglia di fico di Grillo 'portavoce' della democrazia interna del movimento. Ha deciso lui dove posizionarsi e con chi allearsi e ora sta battendo la grancassa mediatica, in perfetta solitudine, per garantirsi il plebiscito interno che legittimi a posteriori la sua scelta. Questo è il momento in cui non è più possibile negare, neppure arrampicandosi sugli specchi, che sia Grillo il dominus del movimento.

- Si completa la parabola ipocrita anti-kasta con l'approdo a un'alleanza per pura convenienza economica: stando con Farage i 5S entrano in un gruppo e hanno diritto a spazi e finanziamenti. Perde completamente di significato la lotta ideologica dei 5S contro il finanziamento pubblico, forse il principale fra i loro cavalli di battaglia in Italia.

- Alla faccia del ""né di destra né di sinistra"", alleandosi con Farage il partito si posiziona nettamente nella destra europea anti-unione, anti-euro, anti-immigrazione, tradizionalista e conservatrice. Io personalmente ho sempre ritenuto il M5S un partito populista di destra, ma molti suoi elettori erano convinti del contrario.

Io personalmente ci vedo un momento trasformativo: con questa alleanza, il M5S diventa compiutamente e apertamente un movimento politico di destra euroscettica populista. Non è più possibile fingere che il movimento sia un ""contenitore"" o un ""condotto"" per le istanze dei cittadini: ha una sua leadership, una sua ideologia e una sua linea tutte imposte dall'alto e soggette più a nessun controllo, neanche solo formale. Ovviamente per chi aveva occhi per vedere era così anche prima, ma ora lo è esplicitamente anche per i più testardamente speranzosi.

Throwing the same wiki page at me over and over again isn't an argument. Saying ""Capitalism = Freedom"" isn't an argument. In fact, many Socialists would argue they're dramatically increasing freedom by ending Corporate slavery and bring the democratic control down to the bottom as opposed to keeping it at the top.

&gt;They are paid what their market value is.

That's not their production value. The market is Capitalist and therefore not paying them what they are worth. This is a [good explanation if you're interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMdIgGOYKhs)

&gt;So where can I own stocks in socialism?

Oh no, you can't own shares, so evil and authoritarian! 

&gt;People argue that power will become the new currency.

People argue that the sky is a carpet made by God. Power is a function of currency.

&gt; Saying one ideology is at fault for everything in the world is ignorant.

No it isn't, and I didn't say it was at fault for everything, just the vast majority of the big things.

Such as colonialism(And colonial genocide), rapid expansion of slavery, most wars, increasing inequality, most crime, and just a whole load of other things.

&gt; I don't care for capitalism nor communism because they are both fundamentally faulty.

What do you care for? Because you're arguing incredibly hard for Capitalism as someone who ""doesn't care for capitalism"".

&gt;Do you seriously believe that or are you just being plain stupid?

Oh, sorry, by that definition nothing on the planet is Capitalism. But seeing as the current version of State monitored Capitalism is virtually the only form that has ever existed, ever, on the face of this planet, then yes, Russia and China are both absolutely Capitalist states. 

&gt;For one even communism has different degrees of pay. 

No it doesn't. 

&gt;Read above where I said ""Both on their own are stupid but if you mix them you've a better society.""

How precisely do you plan on mixing two fundamentally and diametrically opposed ideologies? How do you mix Capitalism with the thing created specifically to destroy it?

I stand corrected. My apologies.

&gt; But that could apply to all studies in economics where mathematic modelling is involved because the modelling makes unreasonable assumptions.

Yes and no. Depends on the research question. Sometimes a quantitative study is the best option. But when it comes to whether or not sovereign debt is harmful for economic growth or not a quantitative study on its own is not sufficient. I'd also argue that the research question sounds a bit too broad to be answered by a quantitative or a qualitative study. But to be honest I did not look at the limitations they set for their study.

&gt;If an entire field is not as much of a hard science as most people assume, maybe it is right to always title claims made within that field in a weaker way in order to not mislead anyone into thinking it's an open and shut case

Exactly. I object the tendency from especial media, politicians and laymen to make simplified statements based on very narrow research findings. But this also is a broader debate within economic research and ironically almost takes us back to the age old debate of keynesian and austrian economics. Now note that I'm not taking any side there, merely pointing out that this debate on how economy should be studied or explained is an age old debate. I am myself a strong believer in that economic phenomenon are very much need to be analysed through both quantitative as well as qualitative studies in a much broader sense then it is done today.

Economics is a weird science and why there isn't more cross science research done combining the fields of economics, sociology and psychology is beyond me. I mean they all can bring in much to explain many economic phenomenon.

p.s. Almost forgot: Moscow has [lost its grip on quasi-state of Abkhazia](http://top.rbc.ru/politics/01/06/2014/927600.shtml), locals revolted and now demand to join Russia because they don't want to be a pawn in Kremlin's ""cat vs mouse"" game with Georgia anymore. Couple of Kremlin's figures (Nurgaliev and Surkov-Dudaev) had to negotiate with Abkhazians to restore status quo in which Abkhazia is ""independent state"" and to prevent situation when Russia may be accused in yet another annexation after recent Crimean campaign and on-going conflict in eastern Ukraine.

p.p.s. I've forgot to explain real reason behind situation in Abkhazia: it's all about money from tourists. Russia had very limited amount of resorts (Sochi + couple towns nearby) and Abkhazia was inexpensive alternative off-shore resort for Russians - along with Crimea, but it was slightly less expensive than Crimea and had shitty tourist services (""services"" included various crimes - up to armed robberies in the center of towns during day time). However now situation has changed dramatically and Crimea becomes much less expensive (I'd say ""more inexpensive"") and has better services so Abkhazia is out of the game with their non-existent quality of services and somewhat high prices (they are higher than in Thailand and Goa for example). So they've faced situation where they'll have no money from tourists - and revolted to join Russia to become more attractive as resort (for example prices in Sochi - which is right at the Abkhzian border - are comparable to best European resorts). Problem for them is - they are needed for Kremlin only as part of Georgia - and it's still persist, Kremlin cannot afford yet another annexation.

true,IntelligentNickname,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; Throwing the same wiki page at me over and over again isn't an argument. Saying ""Capitalism = Freedom"" isn't an argument. In fact, many Socialists would argue they're dramatically increasing freedom by ending Corporate slavery and bring the democratic control down to the bottom as opposed to keeping it at the top.

Holy shit just read the 3 sentences which I linked ""The American economist Milton Friedman argued that under socialism, the absence of a free market economy would inevitably lead to an authoritarian political regime."". It's a biased statement but that doesn't make it less valid.

&gt; That's not their production value.

That doesn't matter. Even if everyone gets paid what their work is worth, the society is still going to be divided in classes. One of the things the video doesn't tell you is that lawmaking and capitalism doesn't go hand in hand. Saying ""well they pay no taxes"" etc etc is because laws in the US has made it as such.

Another thing about capitalism is that people invest their money. If they have 100 million they say ""hmm... I wonder if this is profitable"" and they go invest in a business, and try to make it as much as possible. Tons of people get work, tons of material is required. If none would invest the economic growth would be **terrible**.

&gt; Oh no, you can't own shares, so evil and authoritarian!

You don't know what stocks are do you? Perhaps you should just try to read up on basics of economics.

&gt; People argue that the sky is a carpet made by God. Power is a function of currency.

It isn't. Even if we had a democratic system but no economic system people would trade power as a commodity.

&gt; No it isn't, and I didn't say it was at fault for everything, just the vast majority of the big things.

Lol.

&gt; Such as colonialism(And colonial genocide), rapid expansion of slavery, most wars, increasing inequality, most crime, and just a whole load of other things.

So you're saying colonialism, something that happend centuries before the birth of capitalism, is somehow the fault of capitalism? So you're saying Russia and China, two entirely communistic states, don't war?

&gt; What do you care for? Because you're arguing incredibly hard for Capitalism as someone who ""doesn't care for capitalism"".

You're an ignorant person who don't understand anything about capitalism but somehow criticize it and say ""communism is the al-mighty savior"" like Russian proletarians during the revolution. You view everything black and white and that's what's really dangerous.

&gt; Oh, sorry, by that definition nothing on the planet is Capitalism.

China has been ruled by a communist party. Saying it's capitalistic is just beyond being stupid.

&gt; But seeing as the current version of State monitored Capitalism is virtually the only form that has ever existed, ever, on the face of this planet, then yes, Russia and China are both absolutely Capitalist states.

Not even. Please read up on the differences between capitalism and politics.

&gt; No it doesn't.

Ok fine, ""true communism"" doesn't have pay, but they do share resources inequally. It's the same thing really.

&gt; How precisely do you plan on mixing two fundamentally and diametrically opposed ideologies? How do you mix Capitalism with the thing created specifically to destroy it?

Both have their setbacks. Look at the current nations, they're all shades of grey, not one or the other.

&gt; Socialism is created under one condition; Worker control of the means of production. This is fundamentally the opposite to Capitalism.

To a degree, but did you know states can own businesses? You should try to read up on that. It's perhaps an entirely new concept for you.",0,1401627402,null,0,false,0,chwc8rq,t3_26zmzr,t1_chwc8rq,t1_chwbxpw,null,1434044995,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

In the UK we have some of the largest farms in western Europe, which means we can compete on a large scale to reduce costs, whereas traditionally French farms are small, maybe 10 acres or so which means they can't produce the same amount of food at the same cost. All commercial British farmers would not mind seeing the end of CAP payments as it would actually give them more market share in the EU - it would also allow African farmers to compete, but that is a different story. 

What British farmers would be against is the end of free movement of people as many Brits see agricultural work that of someone below them. Mainly Eastern Europeans come across here to pick berries/eating apples and the majority of brassicas - most of them have degrees and are very intelligent but it is the only work they can get - it also pays well, for someone who picks quickly, and well they can earn £100+ a day.

And where's his evidence for it? Maybe they can quote me in the wikipedia article saying ""Capitalism is the root of all evil and it should be wiped off the face of the Earth"", that wouldn't make it the right opinion. 

The absence of Capitalism does not lead to authoritarianism at all, but of course a Capitalist would say that.

&gt;That doesn't matter. Even if everyone gets paid what their work is worth

No they're not. This has been explained to you repeatedly. What the market values them at is not what they are worth. If worker were paid what they were worth there would be no profit and Capitalism would not exist.

&gt;So you're saying colonialism, **something that happend centuries before the birth of capitalism**

Hah, that's funny. Pick up a history book sometime. Capitalism wasn't invented yesterday. 

&gt;You view everything black and white and that's what's really dangerous.

Moderation Fallacy. Just because I'm arguing for one side does not mean I am not correct.

&gt;China has been ruled by a communist party. Saying it's capitalistic is just beyond being stupid.

Jesus Christ, look past the fucking name. The Communist Party in China is not Socialist in nature at all. A cursory look at them tells you they employ State Capitalism with very, very large amounts of private ownership.

&gt;Not even. Please read up on the differences between capitalism and politics.

Trying to separate Capitalism from Politics is the biggest joke in existence.

&gt;Both have their setbacks. Look at the current nations, they're all shades of grey, not one or the other.

They're absolutely nothing of Socialism. Socialism requires worker control. Just because a state regulates capital does not mean it is Socialist or that it is not in any way Capitalist.

&gt;but they do share resources inequally.

Everyone gets what they need.

&gt;To a degree, but did you know states can own businesses? 

That's something called State Capitalism. Instead of being a condescending ass and replying to everything with ""hurr durr look it up lel"" you should probably know what you're discussing.

true,muupeerd,NETH,The Netherlands,"Lets call the creature by it's name. The muslim extremists as of today follow the religious Branch of Salafism/wahabism as called in the western world, in the Arab world they usually go by the name Takfiri. It's this streaming that follows a literal interpretation of the Quran (at least they claim it does, it's probably just cherry picking parts while ignoring other more peacefull ones). 

It has gotten popular in the last decades at a time where many countries in the Arab world have gotten more conservative after the abolition of colonal rule. It's usually popular in rural area's or Urban area's where lots of rural folks have moved to after lots of population growth. It's the state religion of Saudi Arabia which subsequently spents millions financing mosques all over the world together with their own imams preaching the Salafist doctrine. 

The Muslim immigrants in European countries, often from a rural and poor education background (and continue to be), are especially prone following this branch. In the Netherlands it's estimated 8% of the Morrocan are adherents to this branch,while the other big muslim group the Turks are far less likely to follow this branch. This is partly because the government in the 80s communicated through these immigrants group through mosques, encouraging learning their own languages and maintaining their own culture and religion (basically promoting self-segregation). This was the idea of multiculturalism at the time which now has changed more to the idea integrating. another reason the Turks are less inclined to follow wahabism is because the Turkish government spent a lot of money on the Turks living in Europe to maintain their turkishness and so also build mosques supplied with Turkish imams. While the Morrocan government did nothing and let the vacuum be filled by the gulf countries. 

The effects are probably strenghtened by being in a completely different country with a different culture and losing their own culture while feeling not welcome in the new one (discrimination, which might has been caused by crime and self-segregation in the first place considering other immigrants with brown and black skin color face a lot less discrimination, oh well).

true,[deleted],null,null,"That's an article from 2003 though. The CAP has undergone a lot of reform since then, the brunt of which happened in 2013. Remains to be seen if the new legislation prevents that much waste, but sadly that's a byproduct of all subsidized agriculture.             
                   
The thing is, UK farms also receive subsidies (most of which come from the EU), but since the agriculture sector in the UK is fairly small compared to the ones in countries like France or Spain, the amount of subsidies also isn't as large.              
I did some research and UK agriculture represents only 0.7% of UK's GDP, and only produces less than 60% of the food consumed in the UK. Cultivated land in the UK stands at around 56,604 sq km; while France for example has 227,155 sq km, so you can see why France receives more subsidies than the UK.                 
I don't see the issue with farm size, don't you think helping small and medium sized farms compete with big ones is a good thing though? Having an American style agriculture where almost everything is owned by big companies doesn't seem like such a good idea, at least in my opinion.          
            
Okay, so if the CAP ended, do you think France of Spain wouldn't subsidize their agriculture anyway? All developed countries in the world subsidize their agriculture and if the UK wouldn't, then those farms would be pushed out of the market by much cheaper produce coming from abroad.        
You might dislike the CAP, but it's one way to ensure a level competition field within the EU's single market, so you don't have UK farms going bankrupt because of cheap Spanish produce.           
                   
Sure, the CAP is a very divisive topic, but it does have its up sides. Hopefully with more pressure from the Greens, the waste issue, which is something I also dislike, will get solved in time.

My issue then, taking that chicken-and-egg situation, is who should make the first move? I've argued in another subreddit that, in the case of the Roma, the European societies should be make the first move, as the Roma can't get legitimate income without a fixed place to stay, therfore we need to let them live in a single place without chasing them away.

In the case of the Muslim immigrant communities, though, I will make the opposite case. Why? Because terrorist networks that pervert Islam and recruit among the disadvantaged immigrant communities are extremely dangerous - not just for Europe, but for other governments elsehere in the world, even in the Middle-East. If we want to reach out to them, which I agree would help a lot, we must see some willingness to negotiate or even disarm from them, and a clear mass movement from the non-radical Muslims against these groups.

This is a reply to a question I have not asked, and does not take into account the proposed reforms underway, as other Redditors have pointed out. In other words, you don't reply to the question ""we'll be that much better when we're out"" but you complain about some unreformed current policies.


**AGRICULTURE AND FISHING**

&gt; When half the EU budget goes towards CAP

Half of an amount means nothing. Half of €2bn is €1bn, half of €100bn is €50bn. €1bn for Malta is a lot of money, €50bn for the EU is not. The EU budget is small. This makes CAP's percentage seemingly large. It went up to 70% in the past and it will go down to 40% this year.

UK's often cited Common Market described the goals of a CAP from the very beginning. CAP was and is there for a reason. You took it as part of the deal and voted for it. CAP was reformed again and again, and will be reformed again. Quotas are already set to expire, many proposals are on the table. The agricultural ecosystem is dynamic and this should be reflected on how and where the EU spents our money. 

* The reform process has started: http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/ciolos/headlines/news/2013/01/20130124_en.htm

&gt; the CAP doesn't represent UK farms for the better, but allows continental farms to close the gap.

You don't like others to have advantages in some sectors when you don't benefit equally from it, in this case because you have a more urbanised population, but you don't have any problems with sectors where you take a special interest in. By the way your population still has to eat and you can't do it on your own.

EU isn't about maintaining imbalances, but about creating a level playing field, which means closing the gaps everywhere. Gaps lead to conflicts. That's why the EU was created for, we've learned it the hard way. You seem to think that what isn't in your interest is not of your concern. This has to do with a certain kind of mentality, not with the EU.

While I agree that abuse of the subsidies system should stop, scrapping the system altogether and returning to a national subsidy system will provide fertile ground for more distortions and more scandals.

**FISHING**

I won't repeat the same points, but I will add that fish are a *mobile* natural resource. They're *common* property. In or out, one party can't have its own way. 

* The reform process has started and is a priority for the Irish Presidency: http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/mare/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=9310&amp;subweb=343&amp;lang=en


**TRADE**

&gt; The UK economy is unique to Europe.

No, it's just an economy of another EU member. We don't do exceptionalism here. Unless if by ""unique"" you mean being the clearing house for criminals manipulating rates, affecting the global economy.

&gt; Are we expected to believe an EU commissioner best represents UK financial services when the UK, along with the Czech Republic, were the only two states which refused the EU fiscal compact?

Are Labour supporters expected to believe that a Conservative-led government best represents UK's interests abroad and at home? Are Conservative supporters expected to believe that leaving the EPP was good for your country's interests in Europe? We can do this for as long as you want.

You're not the only country with an interest in financial services. Do you believe that 25 out of 27 states are stupid and don't know what is best for them? Well, you might believe this, but it would be very short-sighted of you.

&gt; We also shouldn't need the EU to trade with countries whom we share a Head Of State with! 

I couldn't help but wonder: are black and Jewish people expected to believe that you have an equal society when they are unable to reach to the post of the Head of your state?

**POLITICAL FUTURE**

&gt; They never wanted political unity or judicial courts. 

My God, again with the issue of courts. Look, you are bound by international treaties, agreements, and all that jazz. International courts already decide for you. You can't escape that. You could try, but you'd have to leave the planet.

EU courts are for matters of EU law. EU law is not a matter for intepretation from Germany, the UK, or any other country. It's a matter for an EU institution. Common Market or Common Market plus whatever you don't like, you would still be bound by some rules, and someone would have to decide in the case of a dispute. That's the European Court of Justice.

As for the European Court of Human Rights, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION.

Let me write it again.

THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE IS NOT THE EUROPEAN UNION. YOU ARE A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE. EVERYONE IN EUROPE IS A MEMBER, APART FROM BELARUS.

Do you want to take Belarus' place?

As for the political unity, you seem to forget how nations and nation-states were and are created. We're not far from the days of an undemocratic multinational empire in which you were part of. I don't see how the prospect of a democratic union could scare someone.


**THE UK RESPONSE**

&gt; The UK is actually saying it will continue to be a net contributor, will continue contributing in European projects and defence. It is saying it will get out of the way of federalism and deeper political integration for those members that need it.

The UK's *current administration* is actually saying that it wants to create a mess by undoing what has been done, for short-term political gain.


&gt; EEA contributions are considerably less than those of the EU, and the UK would only have to agree to regulations relating to the Common Market. Using the Icelandic ratio that means approximately only ~7% of them - whilst retaining all the benefits for the UK, control of the Agriculture and Fishing, and flexibility in trade outside the EU whilst still being a member of the common market.

Germany trades outside of the EU while being a member of the EU. Germany is bound by EU regulations. Germany produces things that people outside of the EU want to buy.

My friends, **you are your own problem**, the EU is not to blame. We were our own problem too, many times in the past. We reformed and got our act together. Take a hint.",0,1401630733,null,0,false,0,chwd117,t3_270o6i,t1_chwd117,t1_chwb9jo,null,1435490585,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

true,trot-trot,null,null,"1. "". . . With the notable exception of the War of 1812, the United States did not face any significant foreign incursions in the 19th century. It contained the threat from both Canada and Mexico with a minimum of disruption to American life and in so doing ended the risk of local military conflicts with other countries. North America was viewed as a remarkably safe place.

    Even the American Civil War did not disrupt this belief. The massive industrial and demographic imbalance between North and South meant that the war's outcome was never in doubt. The North's population was four times the size of the population of free Southerners while its industrial base was 10 times that of the South. As soon as the North's military strategy started to leverage those advantages the South was crushed. Additionally, most of the settlers of the Midwest and West Coast were from the North (Southern settlers moved into what would become Texas and New Mexico), so the dominant American culture was only strengthened by the limits placed on the South during Reconstruction.

    As a result, life for this dominant 'Northern' culture got measurably better every single year for more than five generations. Americans became convinced that such a state of affairs -- that things can, will and should improve every day -- was normal. Americans came to believe that their wealth and security is a result of a Manifest Destiny that reflects something different about Americans compared to the rest of humanity. The sense is that Americans are somehow better -- destined for greatness -- rather than simply being very lucky to live where they do. It is an unbalanced and inaccurate belief, but it is at the root of American mania and arrogance.

    Many Americans do not understand that the Russian wheat belt is the steppe, which has hotter summers, colder winters and less rain than even the relatively arid Great Plains. There is not a common understanding that the histories of China and Europe are replete with genocidal conflicts because different nationalities were located too close together, or that the African plateaus hinder economic development. Instead there is a general understanding that the United States has been successful for more than two centuries and that the rest of the world has been less so. Americans do not treasure the 'good times' because they see growth and security as the normal state of affairs, and Americans are more than a little puzzled as to why the rest of the world always seems to be struggling. And so what Americans see as normal day-to-day activities the rest of the world sees as American hubris.

    But not everything goes right all the time. What happens when something goes wrong, when the rest of the world reaches out and touches the Americans on something other than America's terms? When one is convinced that things can, will and should continually improve, the shock of negative developments or foreign interaction is palpable. Mania becomes depression and arrogance turns into panic. . . .""

A few answers here talk about the pro and cons of membership of the European Union from Britain's perspective, as a Brit myself it seems to go far deeper, and further back in history than simple checks and balances.

The European Union was forged in the dwindling embers of the second world war. A number of industries that were vital to waging war at the time were given entirely to supra national bodies, out of control from nation states, off the top of my head steel production and nuclear research were two of them. This was done readily and quickly, to preserve peace in Europe. But Britain never suffered the war in the same way as the continent. We never had German troops storming the beaches, we never faced real chemical weapons, the horrors of the far right or left, neighbours turning on one another and a resistance movement.

Instead we have a cultural memory of a war that we won, valiantly, when we stood alone against the German war machine. We gave up an Empire to finance it (although this world view ignores the massive independence movements all ready in motion). We lost a lot, but didn't real feel the war. We simply didn't have the same fear of it.

This comment is all ready rather long, but I will quickly mention Parliamentary sovereignty. An oft quoted line says that5 Parliament could make smoking illegal on the streets of Paris. Constitutionally the idea that something can over-ride our legislature, is not an idea that sits well with us, at all. In fact, it fundamentally jives against the civil war we fought against the King over ruling Parliament, the bloodiest war in our history.

That one member being the democratically elected leader of the member state, accountable to the democratically elected national parliament. That is straightforward democratic legitimacy, no matter how you may wish to qualify it to suit your argument.

&gt; Secondly, most of its members are indirectly elected, some of them not having even run for the national Parliament, or being interim leaders

That's an issue at the member state level, surely. But if we are going to use that as a reason to delegitimise the European Council, let's be fair and point out that *the* single leading reason for member states having interim leaders is the Euro crisis brought about by the enthusiasm for political union of people like Juncker. Seems to me that your argument rebounds on itself.

Oh come on, that really is scraping the bottom of the barrel. A mandate exists for the period of office, it doesn't fade over time. I commend the sophistry, but really.

&gt; I'm fully aware that the European Council is itself democratically legitimate. But that doesn't make it an equally democratically legitimised body as the Parliament.

Well, apart from the fact you just made several arguments that the European Council is democratically illegitimate, I simply put the counterpoint: just because the European Parliament has some democratic legitimacy, it doesn't mean that a) it is as democratically legitimate as it should be or b) that it can be considered more (or equally) legitimate than the governments of member states who must ultimately have primacy due to the very nature of the EU as a treaty organisation based on the idea of subsidiarity.",0,1401636245,null,0,false,0,chwep70,t3_26ywiv,t1_chwep70,t1_chwdimy,null,1434046147,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I would be more than happy if UK farms went bankrupt because of cheap Spanish produce; if Spain can produce items cheaper they should be able to control the market. Farming, in my opinion, should be about progression and not about farming the same crop year in year out. 

Larger farms mean that farmers can get better prices for produce, as they have more to sell they can demand higher prices. They can also get better prices for seed, fuel and equipment because of the bulk they buy. I personally don't agree with having too large farms, but also would prefer to see arable farms of 150-250 acres which can provide work for a ""farmily"" and several workers. 

If CAP ended I would expect France to subsidise their farmers due to the amount of poverty/stuff being dumped in Paris. CAP is a lifeline for many small farms but on the other hand, a very large farm near me brings in over £50,000 a year in subsidies which is a pittance for them as they have a ridiculous amount of turnover. 

It would be better to provide grants for farmers to diversify, gain support and get loans at cost to provide them capital to buy more productive animals and more economical equipment.

2. When people speak against the far right, most everyone just goes ""yeah, they're nuts, fuck'em"". But if you go on the net with even a guess that someone who kills jews might be muslim, shit goes to hell and you're branded a racist piece of shit out of the gate.

I find it a lot more threatening that we can't even voice our opinion without it turning into a shouting match because it's not politically correct.

I know westerners have a lot of guilt towards former colonies, but ignoring these very big issues like muslim communities trying to impose sharia law instead of state/secular law and having their extremist views and opinions accepted as a normal part of their cultural identity...

Now that's a more interesting question, and I think noone really knows, apart from what system the different countries present to the commission as what. But even in struggles with countries over their benefit/welfare systems, the commission has always made clear that it's not trying to force countries into not battling ""welfare tourism"". The economies of the EU are just too different to force countries to do that, and the countries themselves would never allow the EU to force them to do it as long as that's the case.

Fact of the matter is that other countries do have policies in place that prevent people from just turning up and demanding money, and they're not challenged for that practice.

* Will the EU be forced to change its laws on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)? *


No, it will not. Basic laws, like those relating to GMOs or which are there to protect human life and health, animal health and welfare, or environment and consumer interests will not be part of the negotiations.

Under EU rules, GMOs that have been approved for use as food, for animal feed or for sowing as crops can already be sold in the EU.  Applications for approval are assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and then sent to EU Member States for their opinion.  So far, 52 GMOs have been authorised.  The safety assessment which EFSA carries out before any GMO is placed on the market and the risk management procedure will not be affected by the negotiations.

The EU and US already exchange information on policy, regulations and technical issues concerning GMOs.  Cooperation of this sort helps minimise the effect on trade of our respective systems for approving GMOs.  We see the TTIP as an opportunity to support this cooperation.",0,1401638237,null,0,false,0,chwfeoa,t3_271aqe,t1_chwfeoa,t3_271aqe,null,1434046480,28,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,28

This man is from the Republic of Ireland where addresses are fully bilingual. 

For example, the address: ***22 Cé an Adhmaid, BÁC 8*** is the exact same as ***22 Wood Quay, Dublin 8***. The Irish postal service recognises both addresses as the same and this is upheld by legislation passed by the Irish government.

Many Irish people use their native Irish name and an Anglicised version interchangeably. The Irish are entitled to change their name from Irish to English (or visa versa) on their passports as long as they show proof of usage over the past two years.

 I personally use my Irish name in official government documentation, banking, bills, etc in Ireland, but use the Anglicised version in the UK.

It's this difference in law and tradition between Ireland and the British administration in Northern Ireland that caused these British officers to overreact and arrest this man. He is entitled to give his address in Irish as it is an official and legal address in the Republic.

Sounds like the [PSNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Service_of_Northern_Ireland) need more training.

they have two parties that change in power (rotate) in USA too - that does not mean that money does not win election - rotation is perception of freedom 

even in my small country you have 3 or 4 parties that rotate on power (every 4 years) - very little significant changes though

&gt; If money decided elections party already in power would win forever.

not if same money is behind both parties and rotates them , or if two groups are behind two parties and they decide to spend more this time because they lost last time - it could be all just a weird power game

If you have billions you do not have nationality , you move to where you think/know where the best opertunity for earning more will be in next 10 , 20 , 30 , ... years and you leave chaos behind you 

you do know that multinational corporations have no problems operating in Eastern and South Eastern Asia - they close factories in the West (expensive labor cost) and open new there (cheap labour)

People on top of empire do not care for people on bottom of empire , they move elsewhere and create new empire

They do not operate on basis of nationalities or similar illusions , that is for poor people

Privates who are trained for tasks not requiring special skills serve for five and half months.

true,Jedibeeftrix,null,null,"&gt; Why do the britains want to leave the EU?

Why?

Because we never bought in to the political project, and only reluctantly backed it in 73 (?) when it was explicitly sold as a trade project.

This would have been fine except for those nasty words; ""ever closer union"".

This resulted in the Euro, which was fine in its ill-begotten abortion of an arrival for as long as the good times remained good we could all of us pretend that there was nothing wrong with a monetary unions that wasn't backed by a economic union, and legitimised by a political union.

And then the End Times arrived...

... and we all remembered precisely how many monetary unions had succeeded with out the other two factors.

In desperation, the eurozone set about setting in place economic union involving such things as the transfer pact, the european banking authority, financial transaction taxes, a european tax base, excluding non-euro countries from trading in euros, etc. On top of which, people started talking about federal structures to legitimise this.

And we looked on in horror! This was not what we thought we signed up for.

And so with every step forward europe takes towards a USE, we take a step backward, and eventually we may have to leave for it may become impossible to remain within the EU and retain fundamental economic sovereignty.

This because it has been stated that the ECB will caucus a consensus opinion on QMV matters among euro-ins in matters relating to the EBA, from which economic governance will spring.

And as we all know from Gladstone, the root of power in a democracy springs from control of the purse.

There simply isn't a european political identity accepted by any useful portion of the british electorate.

To follow up on your analogy, broken as it is, the problem here is that everyone pre-agreed to play 'basketball' but then the referee decided it was going to play football. The UK, and the other member states by treaty, decided that they would pick the President and merely have to seek the approval of the European Parliament, having taken their views into consideration. The UK, and the other governments, had that right snatched off of them. The EP has tried to completely disregard the rights of the member states; someone's trouble making and it's not the UK, in this case. 

Note, I'm not criticizing the idea that the President gets picked by Parliament, it's probably the way it should work. What I'm criticising is the wild extrapolation of the treaty to try and grab that right. The EP is overstepping its treaty rights in the way it conducted itself and presented the election, it's not the UK that's oversteping or 'black mailing' as one other respondent said. The EP is stepping into UK sovereignty that was not ceded to it; that's an incredibly valid reason to threaten to leave the organisation (even though it wasn't a threat but an observation of what could happen, another arch-federalist and power being ceded would be catastrophic to UK-EU relations at the moment).

I'm not an expert, but I believe it's primarily what the various units need. Physical fitness, mental health, ability to work in teams and all that matter. A bad attitude or unwillingness will often get you out.

We're selected right out of high school, so there are fewer University students in the pool. You may apply for a deferement. There are real education opportunities in the armed forces; including mechanics, pilots, truck driver's license, welding, war college (officer) etc. 

If you have skills and serve at a later age you may be placed in a fitting position (IT for example).

If you're a conscientious objector you may serve in [the civil defense](http://www.sivilforsvaret.no/s/English/) or at nursing homes, kindergartens etc.

&gt; Why is conscription still a thing in Norway?

I'm not quite sure myself, in general I believe many find it's a Good Thing(TM) for our youth. It does give you something to bond over. My father and brothers served. My father kepts his AG3 rifle at home since he was legally also a reservist until his 40s. Regular bi-/annual exercises.

We can't match Russia's standing army, but we can train [our Home Guard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Guard_\(Norway\)) and keep reservists. If we're invaded we'll never stop Russia, but we can give them some real resistance along the way. Hopefully, our NATO allies will come to our aid.

Another friend served in a special Home Guard unit that was especially well trained and equipped. They would perform special missions in case of an invasion. They were paid extra to serve as reservists, while continuing to work their normal day jobs.

&gt; conscription for women? Why?

It's a matter of principle and equality; all *citizens* should serve their country. Quite a few young women want to serve [after high school] and have done so voluntarily for many years now. We just changed the laws with regards to duty. The goal is to have 20% women.

true,Doldenberg,GERM,Germany,"Yes, that is separate. Religion as a subject and school and the preparation for confirmation/eucharist are completely independent from one another.

Additionally, where I live, we have very few catholics. So at school, they just go to the protestant version of the subject or to Ethics and then take separate lessons at the local catholic church. 

In the last years, we had a bit of corporation between our school and our local church. For example, we went to the nativity play, staged by students of grade 11 and 12 who take Religion as a course for the last two years. In general, and especially in small towns, churches are much more integrated into the daily cultural life than acting as just religious institutions. A few years ago, Faust was staged as shadow puppetry at our church, and for the last two years, we have had a ""cultural night"" where our theater course staged self-made plays at the church. Additionally, we have TenSing, a form of Christian youth work which originated in Norway. It's supposed to bring teenagers to Christianity by giving them a club where they do their own small musicals, but it's increasingly secularized in the last years as well.

In short, I think for an outsider it might actually appear as if school and religion here are very connected, but when you really look at it, that isn't the case. I actually find it a bit ridiculous that people complain about there being not separation of church and state in Germany, yet it's the US where they discuss whether to teach evolution or creationism in school.",0,1401640124,null,0,false,0,chwg3d7,t3_26ypyd,t1_chwg3d7,t1_chvx9cy,null,1434046808,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,Biiviz,FINL,Finland,"Finnish conscription no longer uses the ""break 'em down and build 'em up"" method. Instead the military education here has taken a form more similar to the one in school, focusing on the military education itself (having purpose built courses or educational packages (e.g. [AT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51d3s9FevyY) or [armor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUxaJ5ogrq4)) except with much stronger discipline, punishments for failure and so on compared to a school, of course.

The military is not an obstacle. It's an opportunity. Yes, it's something you have to do - just like school - and it's physically and mentally demanding, but it is still a unique opportunity to receive a completely different education. Besides learning to kill and tactics, you learn survival, first aid, basic manners (e.g. hat off indoors, opening doors for ""elders"", or taking your glove off when shaking hands), a wide variety of physical exercises, fighting techniques, weapons and explosives safety training, and other specialized training.

MPs for example receive basic police training in addition to their military training. Almost all police officers in the country have served as MPs first before applying to the police academy. Those who get training as pilots find jobs more easily. It's common for FinnAir pilots to be former fighter pilots, for example. You can also get E-drivers license, various sized ship licenses, medical training, explosives papers and so on.

You experience some of the best moments and some of the worst moments of your life. I know for example that I never want to be exposed to tear gas again, especially not Russian wartime-strength tear gas. You push your body and mind to its limits and when you prevail you feel that intense sense of pride and accomplishment: marching until your feet are blistered and bloody, trying to get out of a hole in the ice with skis on, aforementioned tear gas and pepper spray, various gas mask exercises, carrying your friend who weighs double your own weight, getting captured and interrogated, and various other scenarios. Plus shooting lots of guns, anti-tank weapons, detonating explosives, shooting out locks in doors, throwing grenades and clearing rooms is *fucking awesome*.

Add to this all the people from every class in society that you spend 24 hours a day working and living with. It's a great way to get some perspective, learn to understand and make friends and for some - to get them away from their mothers and computers.

TL;DR: The military service is what you make of it. If you screw around and just feel miserable, you're wasting your opportunity. Compact description of how it works:

&gt; The absence of Capitalism does not lead to authoritarianism at all, but of course a Capitalist would say that.

The odds are it will. Perhaps not in the future but with out current politics it will.

&gt; Hah, that's funny. Pick up a history book sometime. Capitalism wasn't invented yesterday.

Joint-stock trading was invented. Some merchants had the concept since before but it was at a smaller scale and frankly, without them we wouldn't start trading eachother. So in reality those are the ones you need to thank for having everything you have today.

&gt; Moderation Fallacy. Just because I'm arguing for one side does not mean I am not correct.

You however assume you are. The thing is you believe everyone in the world is wrong except for one guy named Marx. You don't even seem to have any economic degrees either.

&gt; Jesus Christ, look past the fucking name. The Communist Party in China is not Socialist in nature at all. A cursory look at them tells you they employ State Capitalism with very, very large amounts of private ownership.

So USA are communists aswell? It's gonna be difficult for you to get that one through. China and Russia are communist states, and that's no discussion. China and Russia is the result of communism.

&gt; Trying to separate Capitalism from Politics is the biggest joke in existence.

Same with communism and politics. How are you going to defend that?

&gt; They're absolutely nothing of Socialism. Socialism requires worker control. Just because a state regulates capital does not mean it is Socialist or that it is not in any way Capitalist.

So you're claiming every country in the world are purely capitalist?

&gt; Everyone gets what they need.

So if I need a two summer houses and one mansion, do I get them?

&gt; That's something called State Capitalism.

[Woooooooosh.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism#Use_by_socialists) A TL;DR on that one is that marxists, anarchists and leninists use ""state capitalism"". 

&gt; Instead of being a condescending ass and replying to everything with ""hurr durr look it up lel"" you should probably know what you're discussing.

Just because it has a certain name doesn't make it less valid. Perhaps **you** should look up the meaning of the words before assuming it refers to only capitalism.

I'd hardly call that 'merely'. Also, wording is important - the Council ""nominates"", the Parliament ""elects"". I'd say the latter trumps the former.

 The Parliament is simply exercising it's Treaty rights by preemptively saying that it will not elect (or approve, if you want) a candidate it does not like - which in this case includes any candidate that is not a Spitzenkandidat. The Council is perfectly free to confront the Parliament  and nominate whoever it wants, the Parliament is just saying that it would be pointless and lacking in political legitimacy. Nothing in the Treaty says ""Thou shalt not have your own lead candidates"". This is a political fight, not a legal one.

true,Doldenberg,null,null,"**Racism:** There is a very clear divide when it comes to how many people vote for the NPD - the inofficial successors of the Nazi-party. So yes, we have certain problems with racism, especially in regions with high unemployment rates like Meckblenburg-Vorpommern. We also have more communists though. So, when looking at it from a political perspective, one could say that the west is very centrist, and in the east there's a greater spectrum.

The East is **less religious** though, and in general, violence in Germany is way less common than in America. I would still ask around when traveling somewhere, but it's not like we're lynching people here.

**Infrastructure:** It's not as good as the West, but people are often exaggerating when talking about the East. The parents of a friend of mine rent a few rooms of their farm to tourists and they're actually asking whether they have to bring clean water. NO THANK YOU, WE HAVE THAT. (also, farm might be the wrong word since they have modernized it and only use it for living)

East Germany is a bit more rural, but that doesn't really mean much because even the smaller towns have all the necessary infrastructure like supermarkets and the like. Only when you need to go to the revenue board or the like you'll have to drive a bit. It also depends on the specific region as well.

**Equality:** Yeah, as said, we have more women who work, and as said, are less religious. East Germans still have slightly less income in general though. You'll also see a lot of nude bathing beaches. Actually, you'll almost only see nude bathing beaches, because no one cares or controls the ones there it isn't supposed to be allowed.

And huh, some anecdotal advice to finish it off, you might say people are a bit corrupt in the rural areas, but not really in a bad way. For example, when police recently stopped my uncle and no one in his car used their seat belt, they just let him get off with just a friendly reminder. And recently another friend of our family was stopped by the police and got off without taking a blood alcohol test because she had never did it before and didn't manage to do it right after trying three times (she was sober, but anyway). You'll also see teenagers drinking - which is generally legal btw - and smoking in public. I've actually sold alcohol to minors in front of an off duty policeman. The mentality when it comes to police work here is way more towards ""Just make sure nothing bad happens"" instead of ""Let's punish this vicious criminal! Justice demands his blood!""

I know it's anecdotal, I doubt that it works like this in the bigger cities and you might not agree with me that it is good, but it can sure be surprising for someone growing up the the jail-happy US. I think it has something to do with people in the East still not really being fans of capitalism, so there's still this attitude we express in the common saying ""It needs a whole village to bring up a child."" I recently spoke with a few people from the West who visited and they also said that they think that people in the East are way more friendly and that there's more solidarity.

Non-GM leads the field

“We found that the combination of non-GM seed and management practices used by Western Europe is increasing corn yields faster than the use of the GM-led package chosen by the US,” said Prof. Heinemann.

The research showed rapeseed (canola) yields increasing faster in Europe without GM than in the GM-led package chosen by Canada; and is decreasing chemical herbicide and achieving even larger declines in insecticide use without sacrificing yield gains, all this whilst chemical herbicide use in the US has increased with GM seed.

Heinemann added that “Europe has learned to grow more food per hectare and use fewer chemicals in the process.

In my region, East-Thuringia, we currently have a small problem with Nationalists protesting against a new home for refugees. Those protests are very small though, non-violent, and opposed by a huge mass of counter-protesters. The GDR actually had many guest workers immigrating from communist countries as well. We have fairly many Vietnamese immigrants, for example. Also Russians, Poles and the like. There's a very low population of black people in Germany in general, but I've never heard of racism against them either. Racism here is mainly against Muslims.

Speaking about racism and danger for immigrants is a bit hard for a German, you know. On the one hand, what I tell you might not really look very inviting. On the other, it's just that we're very sensitive towards such topics, and we don't really want to lie to you when it comes to such risks. Still, in total you can feel assured that the risk of being a victim of violence for any reason is incredibly small in Germany compared to other countries. For example, in 2012, there was a total of 158 violent crimes with right-extremist background in Berlin.

You think it isn't? You think our current political system acts exclusively in your interests? You think that current politics is functional? If you answer yes to any of these questions you are deluded.

&gt;The odds are it will. Perhaps not in the future but with out current politics it will.

What odds are that? 

&gt;Joint-stock trading was invented. 

And? You think Capitalism only exists as a result of stocks?

&gt;Some merchants had the concept since before but it was at a smaller scale and frankly, without them we wouldn't start trading eachother. 

Capitalism - or if we're going on your absurd, nonexistent definition of absolutely unregulated and uncontrolled Capitalism, then we can say Capitalistic tendencies - has been around for centuries. It's had its time and place and it was useful then for that precise reason. Not anymore.

&gt;So in reality those are the ones you need to thank for having everything you have today.

Of course I do. I can thank them for everything I have today. Absolutely. That doesn't mean it isn't a fundamentally exploitative system and that it shouldn't be dismantled. 

We can thank the Chinese government for enforcing cheap labour so I can afford all this shit, that doesn't mean I should like the Chinese government or that I should like how they treat their workers.

&gt;You however assume you are.

Of course I assume I'm correct. If I didn't think I was correct I wouldn't argue my point.

&gt;The thing is you believe everyone in the world is wrong except for one guy named Marx.

No.

&gt;So USA are communists aswell? 

No.

&gt;China and Russia are communist states, and that's no discussion

That's the most patently absurd and moronic thing I've ever seen. No. Just no. Learn what the fuck Communism is. Fucking hell.



&gt;Same with communism and politics. How are you going to defend that?

I'm not going to. The difference is that I can't buy politicians in one and I can in the other.

&gt;So you're claiming every country in the world are purely capitalist?

""Pure"" Capitalism is nonexistent, thankfully.

&gt;So if I need a two summer houses and one mansion, do I get them?

No. 

&gt;A TL;DR on that one is that marxists, anarchists and leninists use ""state capitalism"".

Well;

&gt;marxists

Sometimes

&gt;anarchists

Never. This is contradictory to the concept of Anarchism.

&gt;leninists

Yes. 



Okay, so what I'm getting from you is that;

1. There is no Capitalism currently taking place(Despite the fact it is)

2. The USA is Communist, and so is Russia and China. The logic of this stance is totally absurd, so I don't understand it.

3. That Socialism is authoritarianism because it isn't Capitalism, despite the fact that most countries on the planet are no longer Democracies but are Oligarchies or Plutocracies, and despite the fact Socialism is managed by direct democracy and worker(i.e. 99% of the population) control, it is somehow authoritarian

4. Despite the fact Socialism ends Corporate Slavery, it restricts personal freedom. This has not been elaborated on.

5. That you deny that there is increasing global monopoly and increasing economic stagnation, despite every single sign indicating otherwise.

6. You believe that Capitalism does pay workers what they are worth, because Capitalism says so.

7. You deny that Capitalism is centuries old. Someone should probably tell the slaves shipped off to the Caribbean and Americas for the Sugar and Tobacco industry that it wasn't so prices could be cheaper and companies could make bigger profits. I guess the India Trade Companies didn't exist either. Or the thousands upon thousands of other industries. Or banks. Nope, no Capitalism.

So not the market. I mean thing called demand?

So the market will not decide the cost of production. How will you know if the cost of the production is above the possible income of the sold finished product? How will you motivate a supply big enough to sustain your production?

&gt;Back to the workers

Ok. Sure this has been tested and does work on small scale at least. No different from workers owning stock in a company.

You see I'm not against the concept of worker owned businesses. Not at all. I think they're a nice addition to traditional corporations. I don't think all corporations should be like this but I don't see a problem with people starting enterprises like this. That's the beauty of capitalism, everyone can do enterprise as they please.

As long as you keep the state away from it it might even work. But as soon as you introduce central planning of any sort it will fail.

You don't need socialism to make this happen. The framework is already built in into capitalism. The only thing you need are people willing to leave their job and start their own business where they are the owners, workers etc. In fact your chances of succeeding are far better in a capitalistic world than in a socialist world if you want to own and operate businesses even when the owners are the workers.",0,1401646461,null,0,false,0,chwilmc,t3_26zmzr,t1_chwilmc,t1_chwhvjz,null,1434048053,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

But he is the embodiment of aggressive cultural chauvinism. His Eurocentric (Or more practically Western-centric) views seep into his understanding of geopolitics as well, as can be inferred from his response to the Saudi authorities- Wilders said and I quote ""Who do they think they are to lecture to a Dutch politician?"" It is not unthinkable that this man still views the rulers of the world's largest exporter of oil as uncivilized dependents of Western benevolence (or something along those lines). This attitude is hardly conducive to the long term prosperity of his country given the way the global balance of power is changing by the day. 

As Europe wallows and dithers, this is no way to help the Netherlands make friends and allies outside the Old Continent. Western Europe's economic future depends on its alliances built with Asia, the Middle East, Africa and North America and until Wilders (who could well be in power soon) develops the ability to be a cultural pluralist, these types of diplomatic blowouts will only continue to happen across the increasingly prosperous Islamic world, isolating the Netherlands from such competitive markets. 

To Dutch commentators on the forum- if you are businesspeople, considering that there will be far more economic opportunity in the future in places like the Arabian Gulf than at home, it's probably not the best idea to vote into political office a man who publicly branded Islamic culture as ""retarded""- regardless of what it is you may really think.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"&gt;So the market will not decide the cost of production. How will you know if the cost of the production is above the possible income of the sold finished product?

I didn't understand your question. Yes, the market would broadly outline the costs, but the decision of how much to sell things at etc., as today, would be left up to the people doing the selling. 

The primary difference between modern business and Socialism would be worker control. Everything else could, logically speaking, stay *roughly* the same. But the dynamic as a result of worker control of all capital would cause a massive social shift. 

&gt;That's the beauty of capitalism, everyone can do enterprise as they please.

But here's the problem; Socialists don't view it this way. Yes, everyone can start any business they like. Great. But to Socialists this is like saying ""Well, you could just choose to not be a slave"". Technically, yeah, you could make that choice, but it doesn't change the reality. 

We see Capitalism as a fundamentally exploitative system, where in the ""traditional"" company, as you call it, workers are exploited by the system. How does this exploitation look? 

Well, for one, workers do not make the decisions. They can decide to leave the company, and then they're unemployed and end up poor as fuck. Depending on which country that is, that can be living with no luxuries to starving to death. Not a fair choice. 

Secondly, the workers are not paid what they are worth. Which we've already discussed. 

Socialism wants to end that system, so that no workers are exploited and that all the people on this planet are treated fairly and equally regardless of where they happened to be born or what they were born into. In contrast, in a Capitalist society, you have massive corporations like Nestlé fighting against and ignoring child labour laws, or companies taking the money from one country and investing it overseas because the workers over there are easier to exploit because of the lack of worker's protections; Eg. Bangladesh or China. 

So, for us, it's not really a matter of ""Live and let live, you don't bother me I don't bother you"", it's a matter of ""These people are doing bad things, we should stop them"", which is why these ideologies are not compatible, and why Capitalists try to suppress Socialism and why Socialists often become so militant.

&gt;As long as you keep the state away from it it might even work. But as soon as you introduce central planning of any sort it will fail

A lot of Socialists see ""the state"" as part of the problem, as in the current system exclusively serves Capitalists, and that the lawmakers don't serve the people. Taken on its own, outside of Socialism, this is a common belief amongst many, many people. Probably the majority of people. As such, there can only ever be implementation of Socialism when the state is radically changed to represent the will of the people; And at this point you diverge into Reformist Socialism and Revolutionary Socialism, which is a whole different argument to get into.",0,1401647239,null,0,false,0,chwix7w,t3_26zmzr,t1_chwix7w,t1_chwilmc,null,1434048204,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The thing about the communism is that it's extremely painful to me to see that of millions of western kids are not taught this part of history for the simple reason that the winners of WWII wrote the history. Schools spend years on teaching the pupils about the Nazi atrocities and almost no time on the ones of the russians. In this context I fully understand how young people those days romanticise communism just like they would probably have romanticised national socialism in an parallel universe.  Their ideals might be nobel but they are just the product of history being interpreted for political benefit. What also hurts me a lot is seeing them getting violent about their ideals: ""how can you be against dividing resources between all people, you filthy nazi pig!"" - ""Well, I am not, I'd give my life for a fair and just world, where all people have the same opportunities, and nobody has be suffer, but the last people who advocate your equality under the same label of communism, enslaved whole countries, murdered and robbed plenty of people and only enriched themselves, but of course I would't expect you to know that as you never learned about it in school""

true,RamblinRambo,FINL,Finland,"&gt;We see Capitalism as a fundamentally exploitative system, where in the ""traditional"" company, as you call it, workers are exploited by the system. How does this exploitation look?

Much better. But I for an example see the socialist system as people being exploited by the state. An inevitable state tyranny.

&gt;Secondly, the workers are not paid what they are worth. Which we've already discussed.

You are paid a market prise based on your skill. If you feel that your pay is too low you can increase your skill or seek another employer. I am for the existence of worker unions as they have worked well in western Europe. I am not that naive that I think that one single worker can go against a billion dollar corporation, so unions are needed. I agree there.

&gt;In contrast, in a Capitalist society, you have massive corporations like Nestlé fighting against and ignoring child labour laws, or companies taking the money from one country and investing it overseas because the workers over there are easier to exploit because of the lack of worker's protections.

Socialism has been very good at this too. Fabricating famine, forcefully moving people, killing people for their property and in worse case sentence them to work for free on made up charges.

From a modern perspective I am for us introducing high import fees on goods from China etc. We need to protect ourselves and our interests. But I do not thing the socialist structure will help us there.

I honestly don't say that socialism is bad as an idea. What I say is that it's impossible to ever implement anywhere because of human greed and love for power. Hence an open system as democracy and controlled capitalism with regulation is the best possible solution. It works and it has been working for a long time. The problem is uncontrolled capitalism where corporations are allowed to roam free and where the state stats to exist for the corporations rather than the people. And unfortunately the US has moved to almost being a corporate state and the EU is taking us fast towards this very system and I do not want to be a part of that.

To, say, the Dutch, Hitler was the big bad guy. Not because he killed more people total than Stalin did, but because he killed more dutchmen than stalin did, because he invaded and occupied the Netherlands and because he actually was an enemy.

Stalin and the USSR were a spectre and a terror but the Nazi's were a more tangible, more *real* enemy to most of Western Europe. 

It's the other way round for Finland and I think this would explain the different perspectives on the matter.

Take the Netherlands for example; people who had fought the Germans and/or lived through the German occupation *left* the country after the Germans were gone. They left because they feared the commies would advance further and that they would have to face war again.

Hitler was the real problem in the Netherlands but people afterwards fled because Stalin (and his successors) weren't looking any better.

Given your Irish passport how can they know if you live or not in ireland? they can't and they wont ask for electricity bills so i guess residence/citizenship will be the same here :p

In fact what is/was usually considered the face of the ""moderate"" rebellion was the Free Syrian Army (FSA). But I doubt this was ever true. This was just the image presented by the Syrian Opposition in Turkey/London/Paris.  Because the FSA actually never established any kind of political policy or directive or any long term political agenda. They - completely unlike the Jihadis - never required any ideology for groups and people to join them. Being against Assad was enough for them. The FSA initially had the majority of fighters and the promises for western weapons and support certainly helped them in that. But that doesn't make any implications about the political ambitions of those fighters.

As soon as the Jihadis got more organized they started to attract most of the fighters and whole FSA brigades simply switched. But unlike the FSA the Jihadis come with a strict ideology and enforce it among their members. And those Jihadis are not all foreign. E.g., Jabath al-Nusra (the official al-Qaeda group in Syria) is majority Syrian.

The US does not have to have a base on every country in the world to defend the North Atlantic. The fact that the US chooses to have military bases in every patch of earth possible is their prerogative if they want to spend the money. The US wants to dominate the entire world militarily, control the pacific and the middle east. Most other NATO countries want to defend their own land, NATO land and perhaps want the ability to intervene through alliances in North Africa or the Middle East should there be rectifiable humanitarian atrocities there or the safety of their country is threatened. Why are the military spending of these two compared - they aren't measuring the same thing? One is the cost of NATO defence and the other is the cost of total domination. 

Also does it count as free-loading when you aren't given a choice to reject it? Is there really any need to have 23 USAF bases in the UK? Can the RAF not do the job? Why 23 why not 20 or maybe just 10? Is the UK's security so dire and the lack of other bases in other countries so extreme that they need to be so concentrated? It don't think so. In fact it seems like protection of allies is a secondary consideration and instead allies are used as forward operating bases for wherever the US decides it needs to attack; which would be fine if we want it that way. Has the public *ever* been able to decide whether they want US airbases dotting the country? Has the US public *ever* been able to decide if it want's to spend 16% of it's budget on the military? The extensive operation of the US military is totally without democratic mandate by the US people (because there exists no candidate who would limit the military) or by the people's whose land is [either taken forcefully](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagossians) and replaced with US bases or suddenly turns into a flight path. There is a widespread consensus in Washington and in every NATO-affiliated capital that the US military should police the world and that allies will assist this. No politician since Vietnam has offered an alternative and the American public has thus been unable to chose US foreign policy for about 50 years. In the US it's called [the National Security Consensus](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/05/the_national_security_consensus) and in Europe it's called NATO. No-one has been consulted and yet we're supposed to be so humble and grateful because we'd be overrun by some unexplained enemy without the glorious protector? And to question this consensus is to be free-loading and naïve? I'm pretty sure no-one in Europe would oppose military cuts of the US military so their government shouldn't worry.

I would not say that, I would not say that at all. It is just that the CDU leadership has changed.

Her only real principle is winning elections though.

&gt;ruling CDU party declared the German multiculturalism a failure – have no basis in reality?

Some time ago (2010) Merkel did indeed say ""Multiculturalism is a failure"", but the same woman also said ""I do not want capitalism"" (at the height of the financial crisis if I recall correctly). And the meaning of that sentence about the failure of multiculturalism was never clarified, and *absolutely nothing* changed after that. The next (in)famous utterance about immigration coming for her party was ""Islam belongs to Germany"" (2012),  and they have stressed the importance of immigration for Germany many times since.
Basically it was a curious soundbite of no consequence, she probably thought (at that time) it would gain/keep some votes, just like the ""I do not want capitalism"" statement. The CDU is very much pro-immigration nowadays.

A boss with an eye on profit would check for inefficiencies, strains on the budget and kick people out. Maybe expand into other markets.

You can't expect this from a huge collection of people.

There are plenty of other faults with it.

In the end capitalism has driven people and companies to go for efficiency and quality and to adapt to the needs and wants of the market. Not for the common good but for money. And then we have this nice thing called a social democracy that tries to keep it in check as much as possible and defends the common good where capitalism might conflict with the common good. It's a nice mix of capitalism and socialism that isn't greatly balanced in every place and that sometimes fails. Again due to human flaws. But so far it's a lot better then either extremes both of which have easily visible flaws.

I didn't even knew till few minutes ago there were other kinds of cards besides poker cards (or how they are called). It's just cards - in big 52 or small (24 cards) variation.

There's this childs game Wojna - Polish version of this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game) that every kid played a few times to learn cards are boring ;)

Young people usually play Pan which is a beating game  where you have to lose all your cards as fast as possible. Also known as ""Chuj"" which is vulgar for penis.

Another popular games are http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau_(card_game)

Older people most often play 1000 (tousand), it's the most popular ""serious"" game besides poker: http://www.pagat.com/marriage/1000.html

There's also this game ""Oszust"" (liar) - it's less popular but it's great because of psychology and I love it. It's played with whatever suit of cards (52 or 24 are the most common). Player with the lowest hearts card starts, all the other players in clockwise order has to put one card at a time, image to the table so nobody see if it's really the card he says it is. It must be equal or higher than what is supposed to be at the top of the stack, and of the same color (if they doesn't have that color they must get one card from the stack). You can cheat - put more than one card at a time or put different card that's supposed to be there. At any time anybody can say ""check"" and see if you placed the correct card - if you did he takes all the cards, if you cheated you take all the cards.

And the FN, UKIP, and all the other nationalists parties are what? And what about the Swiss Minaret Ban or the French Ban on headscarves. You accuse me of rose-colored glasses but I can accuse you of the same.

As per what I said about minorities in Europe for the first time, I could have been more clear. I did not mean merely ethnic minorities such as the Jews or the Roma (obviously you have had those for a long time). I meant racial minorities, which is what is usually being referred to when someone says ""minority"" in America. Racial minorities in Europe have been low throughout history (with the exception of the Moors of Iberia and Turks throughout the former Ottoman Empire, and look how that turned out. The presence of a large level of Muslim immigration, which is in and of itself a misleading term, for Turks are different from Algerians are different from Pakistanis, is a recent development.

Gun advocacy (Which I am against. I don't understand my fellow Americans on this point) is not tied into race. Europe can teach us a thing or two about racist politicians. Some FN town councilors called Mandela a terrorist recently. They would be run out of town on a rail if they said that in America. Same thing applies to Papa Le Pen's ebola comments.

Schools aren't segregated, the communities that they serve are because of economic disparities. And I have said before that those economic disparities should be the next targets to fix.

- La Latina : A hipsterish bar and tapas zone behind sol centered around the mercado de la cebada which is the old grain market of madrid (no longer open), its a beautiful area and its a good place to have a bite and drink, As a note, this area is usualy dead by day, you are best served going here as a evening event. 

- Plaza colon : a large plaza with a underground theater right under it and a large Spanish flag over it, its OK to see

- The old town behind Sol there are 3 major squares, Plaza de santa ana, Plaza de Jacinto benavente and the smaller Plaza Provincia, the thing is that most american cities are prepalanned off a main street in to a grid, while most large european cities started as small villages and towns, and you can see that by exploring a little bit behind the scenes. 

- If you´re a true foodie you might want to check Mercado Maravillas, Its not touristy at all and this is the  2nd largest food market in madrid where people actually do their shopping, the largest is Mercamadrid but thats a suppliers market and its the suburb of vallecas, theres not much to see there. Anyways, Mercado maravillas is one block down from cuatro caminos in the direction of plaza castilla. 

- The 27 bus : this is a tricky one becuase its a normal city bus in Madrid, It runs from Plaza castilla which is a northen central bus termial to Embajadores in the south, but the curious thing about this bus is that it runs all along the Castellana/Paseo del prado which is the main avenue of madrid, a ticket costs 1,50€, Personaly i would recommend you only ride it from Nuevos ministerios to Atocha, The nice thing about this bus is that on its route you have plaza colon, The roman inspired status which are in some of the plazas (like cibeles or neptuno), Several museums, Casa america, The old mail center which is now a cultural center, the Botanical gardens. But remember, Its a normal line bus not a tourist bus. 

- If you´re a Soccer fan, The Real Madrid stadium is just outside the Santiago Bernabeu metro station, or you can start your 27 bus run from there instead of Nuevos Ministerios. The Atletico de Madrid stadium which is the Vicente Calderon is a bit more tricky as you have to either walk from Pyramides metro station or take the line 50 bus from Sol. 

- Palacio de inverno/Campo del moro/Jardines Sabatini: The old winter palace with its garden and square, its nice to see and a short walk from sol or you can take the back route from plaza españa after visitng Templo de Debod. 

- The opera house and its plaza which is a short walk from the palace mentioned in the previous point. ",0,1401651539,null,0,1401652032,0,chwko7m,t3_271asf,t1_chwko7m,t3_271asf,null,1434049029,4,false,Madrid,t5_2si9y,4

There's the obvious problem of talking about the ""average"" German, obviously. As said, no one gets up at exactly 6:23. Especially when mixing it up, as someone pointed out in the comment: 2800€ isn't what someone doing the job shown would actually get (EDIT: Okay, I just noticed that is before taking taxes. So it could actually be accurate). Also, since we have the same problems with demography as everyone else, the whole ""What does an average German do?"" is logically skewed towards ""What does an average older German do?"" Many older Germans are religious and don't have a very active life outside the household.

Yet, showing the average German was the goal of the documentary so yeah, I can't really understand people who complain that this is not how people around them life, when those people aren't average... as practically no one is.

Also, they are in West Germany. It's a bit sad, but there's still a lot of difference between the East and the West (also, Bavaria...). For example, you have a lot more working mothers in the East. The whole ""I can't work because my kids get home so early."" isn't a problem there because we have so called ""Hort"" where kids can stay, play, do homework and are supervised after school up to grade four, or at some places even beyond that.

It might also be worth to discuss how common Waldkindergartens are, but when you consider that children enter school at 4 in the UK, yes, even our normal kindergartens and nurseries are a huge improvement.

In general, his wifes complaints are right, there is still a problem with equality in the higher levels. I still think it was drawn out of proportion - yeah, when you talk to stay at home moms, they'll of course tell you that they want to stay at home; and as said, the amount of housework is a average of all Germans and won't apply to their unique circumstances and I believe that staying at home in the early years of a childs life isn't so bad, but after that there is definitely a problem with getting women back to work.

EDIT: Why do Youtube comments always make you lose trust in humanity... Seriously, every other comment devolves into a discussion of the fucking war.

I got lucky and got my ""dreamjob"" as a medic, where I learned a lot of useful knowledge and could do an internship at a hospital. I even got a certificate at the end, which I could use to get a job within the health sector (although I have no interest in that now). 

There are a lot of problems though in the Swiss army. Sometimes the equipment is quite old, but our officers are a way bigger problem. While our seargents where ok, our lieutenant couldn't lead some infanterists, like he would have liked. So he tried to turn us into infanterists, which didn't really work and didn't make sense. The even higher officers are even worse, their strategics are from the 80s and the seem really detached from reality. 

The daily life was sometimes really stressful, with only 15 minutes to eat and much running around. Other platoons didn't have to do this, because they had a better lieutenant. While the lections on healthcare and first aid were interesting and shooting was fun, there were also many boring and ussless lessons on ABC weapons and other stuff, as well as endless hours of cleaning everything.

""Here's the thing though, just cus it's widespread doesn't mean these things aren't committed by a fringe of the community. Terror attacks committed by Muslims are committed by less than 1% of the total muslim population. The reason it seems like Muslims are committing more crimes of this manner than other groups is because of the way it is reported. When a white guy from Britain commits a hate crime or 'terror' attack, you don't extrapolate that or associate that with all Christians, all Europeans, or all White people, or any macro over arching common set. But when a Muslim commits such a crime ,anywhere in the world-for whatever reason, what people automatically associate it with, because of the way it's reported, is the fact that they are Muslim. Can you see how this affects the way we perceive things? No other group of people this large with such a varied population on Earth gets held responsible or tagged for the crimes of its criminals as Muslims. So what did you expect? When an American commits a vile crime, it's ""Florida man does A,B, and C"". And the accepted notion is that it was an individual who fucked up. When a Muslim, from a larger set of people than the population of America x5/6 does something vile, it's ""Muslim man does A,B,C, what does this say about Islam?"". Again, do you see the issue here? Muslims aren't predisposed to violence more than any other 'type' of people. But you perceive they are because of the way things are reported and the ways we interpret events around the globe. I can provide numbers to back this up if my rhetoric doesn't sway you.

Now, if you want to ask why Muslim lands are more often than not in violent climates, or why Muslim acts of violence are more politically charged, that's a different issue all together with a much more complex if not ambiguous answer. One that's gonna take an understanding of the history of Islam, the history of the world, and a good understanding of geo-politics/the socio-demographics of the world. Not something that can be broken down so easily. But lets get one thing clear: it is the fringe who commits to extremism among Muslims. If you are gonna use all those countries as a reference, you can't be blind to how large of a population you are talking about. Trust me, if it were even 20% of then Muslim population giving in to extremism, we'd be living in a state of emergency. Fringe is fringe.""

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"The UK maybe, because we share so much history and have very similar worldviews, relatively speaking. Israel and Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, are much more free agents than Americans like to think. Israel was a French client state until the 60's, and Saudi Arabia has already started building up connections outside of the Middle East to become the regional power themselves, in the absence of US authority. 

You seem to believe that I am saying Obama's mistake was not going to war in Syria. I am not. His first mistake was saying that Assad ""had to go,"" and then doing nothing to make that happen; and the his bigger mistake was saying that the use of chemical weapons was a ""red line,"" and then, when that red line was crossed, he made a deal that made Assad a partner (in getting rid of Syria's old, expensive-to-destroy chemical weapons) instead of an enemy to be punished. The Obama's policy on Syria has vacillated from grandiose demands combined with no tangible effort to make those demands happen, to a weak-kneed agreement to make the dictator into an ally of a disarmament agreement. Remember when Obama said ""Assad must go""? Well, our allies will remember. They will remember very well the big promises that came from the White House, and more importantly, they will remember how we did *nothing* about them. 

Do you think this doesn't matter? If Obama says that Chinese assertions of sovereignty over the South China Sea are a ""red line"" that must not be crossed, how do you think our Philippine and Vietnamese allies, or for that matter the Chinese themselves, will see that? Do you think that statement is backed with the full force of the United States? Or will they dismiss it as a rhetorical flourish and simply ignore it? 

Likewise in Ukraine. Grand rhetorical demands from the White House have not been matched with real action to counter Russian aggression, and likewise our red line keeps moving back. Russia invaded and annexed the Crimea, but our ""red line"" (not for military action, but merely for sanctions, and only against a limited number of Russians) now is only for further support of Ukrainian separatists. What about the Crimea? What are we doing to punish then for that?

Obviously, Bush's wars were expensive and probably poorly-thought-out. But Obama's foreign policy is a disaster. That he is (potentially) better than Bush is a stupendously low bar to set. That's like saying his strategic thinking is better than Chamberlain's. By any reasonable standard, Obama's foreign policy has been awful. Overall, it has been characterized by grandiose rhetorical overtures to traditional foes of the US with no discernible positive effects, and failure to nurture and cultivate relationships with our allies. 

The fact is, the President should not make promises he cannot back up, or make demands that he cannot ensure will be agreed to. Doing either will ensure that his office becomes meaningless. Obama has not learned that lesson, to the dismay of 20 million Syrians and 40+ million Ukrainians,  to say nothing of the 300+ million Americans he has made to look ridiculous.

Really. Well I'd bet the opposite to be honest.

Had the central bankers increased interest rates to match the economic boom and let it cool off like we've done before in history a disaster like this could have been avoided and they'd actually be able to significantly stimulate growth by lowering interest rates.

It's time for Europe to walk its own path and not follow the US path of destruction. We need more regulation and not less regulation of the financial markets. No more bailouts of any private entity, ever. The whole sub prime scam was built through little or no regulation what so ever.

Things ranging from stripping children and excessively beating them all the way to institutionalised rape/prostitution of children.

&gt;The thing is there are hundreds of these mass graves of infants all over the country.
And not just in the grounds of the old Magdalene Laundries either.
In rural Ireland, all over the island, there are secret places. Usually only the elderly know exactly what they are, though there is usually some lingering folk superstition about such places even among the very young. They are patches of wasteland, mysteriously untouched by the last 15 years of building frenzy, on the boundary between townlands, where the unbaptised babies who died young and the unwanted children of abuse are buried.
I could take you to 5 or 6 such places off the top of my head in north Donegal. And that's just the places where I had sufficient contacts in the local community to be able to point to the mysterious patch of wasteland and ask the right questions. They are everywhere. Nobody wants to talk about them, but they exist. If you are on the island of Ireland outside of the big towns, there is probably one within 10 miles of you.
Just ask where the boundaries of the townland are, and go a good walk of a Sunday. They are easy to spot, when you know what you are looking for. Then find an elderly local and ask if the plot is for the little angels.
For a long long time Ireland was a seriously fncked-up vicious nasty exploitative authoritarian, nasty nasty nasty corrupt place. It still is. The same sick and twisted psychology manifests today in the Irish version of ""austerity""....cuts for the poor, the disabled, the sick and the elderly, jam for the mega-rich, landlords and bankers.
I often say there are terrible dark secrets lurking just under the surface of Irish society. The Irish are a traumatised and brutalised people and the traumas of the past still reverberate in the psychology of today.

Es ist halt so, dass /r/de der letze Sub ist in dem ich dran denke was zu posten. Nenn mir etwas, bei dem du denken würdest ""Das muss ich in /r/de posten""

EDIT: Ich glaub ich weiss wie ichs erklären kann. Meine Meinung:  

Einen Link hier zu posten macht nur Sinn wenn die Eigenschaft, dass das Thema des Links entweder was mit Deutschland/Österreich/Schweiz zu tun hat die **wichtigste** Eigenschaft dieses Dings ist. Also entweder in deutschsprachigem Gebiet passiert, jemand ist deutsch, es ist auf Deutsch/Österreichisch/Schweizer. Sobald an dem Post was anderes dran ist, das wichtiger ist und dass zu einer interessanteren Diskussion beitragen würde postest du das im entsprechenden Sub. 

Beispiel:  

* Jemand will Code seines Handyapp posten -&gt; /r/apps (Handygame ist wichtig, interessiert /r/switzerland nicht)
* Jemand will Code seiner App posten, die anhand von Fragen zum Dialekt deinen Heimatskanton herausfindet -&gt; /r/switzerland, interessiert /r/apps nicht

true,atred,ROMA,Romanian-born American,"&gt;You seem to believe that I am saying Obama's mistake was not going to war in Syria. I am not. His first mistake was saying that Assad ""had to go,"" and then doing nothing to make that happen; and the his bigger mistake was saying that the use of chemical weapons was a ""red line,"" and then, when that red line was crossed, he made a deal that made Assad a partner (in getting rid of Syria's old, expensive-to-destroy chemical weapons) instead of an enemy to be punished.

I don't believe any such things, I also don't really care what you personally think. I used Syria as an example of what Obama is criticized for by conservatives. 

So your problem is not that Obama didn't start a war and your criticism was that he spoke against Assad, use of chemical weapons, Russian's actions in Ukraine, without attacking them. You are living in a strange world, do you want US president to simply accept the use of chemical weapons, invasions of other countries without saying anything? Both in the case of Syria and Russia he did whatever was prudent and smart to do. In case of Syria he walked on the line of starting a bombing campaign and only the credible threat of military intervention stopped Assad and made him promise to give up chemical weapons... now, that that's hard to implement and verify is a different thing, but in a way it's the best result that US could obtain. 


Consider the alternatives:

1. Obama would not say anything about Syria and use of chemical weapons against civilians -- obviously an immoral choice.

2. Obama would only weakly mention that ""use of chemical weapons against civilians is *baaaad*"". Assad would have continued to do exactly what was doing before -- again, not much difference from point 1.

3. What actually happened. Obama made a credible threat, talked about red line, laid the responsibility on Assad, Assad could have really made the choice not to cross the red line, but once he did, it was obvious that Obama would use the military force, it was averted only in the last moment because there was a deal to get rid of chemical weapons, and while the deal is far from perfect, it's the best it can be attained in this situation. It doesn't show that Obama is weak it shows that he's smart.

4. Obama talked about the red line and then used the force against Assad just to show that US President doesn't mince words. (favorite choice for conservatives, but idiotic).

I would claim that 1 and 2 are weak and immoral options and #4 is stupid when there are other options because it would have involved unnecessarily US in another war. The only smart option is #3, which is exactly what Obama actually did. Can you tell me if there's another option that I miss, or why #4 is not idiotic? BTW, also not saying that military option is never good, or that it might not end up there if Assad doesn't give up his chemical weapons and continue to use them. What I'm saying is that what happened was the smartest way to deal with the situation and I actually don't see a better alternative, do you?

And most of them were forgotten about and swept under the rug immediately in a concerted effort. The Polish weren't even allowed into the victory parade and were told to go home, where thousands of them were rounded up and/or executed as ""spies"".

The reason Britons want to leave the EU is that successive governments have blamed the EU for anything that people found unpopular.  Prices rising? It's the EU.  Excessive regulation? It's the EU.  Immigration? It's the EU.  Bad weather? It's the EU.  All this despite the fact that the UK had an effective veto on EU policy through the Council of Ministers.

The media has been complicit in this.  The Murdoch-owned press have been the worst, but even the more moderate media outlets have failed to inform the public on what the EU does for the economy - they tend to default to the bullshit ""straight banana"" stories.

In the end we have an electorate who believe, erroneously, that the EU is generally a bad thing, and a wing of the Conservative Party who genuinely believe that we'd be better off outside the EU (but most of them also believe that we'd be better off with hanging, flogging and workhouses too...).

As a result British politicians are in a bind.  Every mainstream party knows that to leave the EU would be economic suicide, but they are having to commit to stupid policies like an in/out referendum because their poorly informed electorate demand it.

If a country has 1/5th of the working age population unemployed then you could make a reasonable argument that most people in the country are working roughly 5/4 of the hours that they should be (as there is not enough work to go around). Now its obviously not exactly this ratio because not every job could be done by more people - for example a CEO probably has to work the hours that need to be worked. And it might be that some of the unemployment is due to a skills shortage. But certainly in the more interchangeable roles where there is no skills shortage, society should probably accept that the hours that are expected to be worked increase and reduce based on demand.  But my figure of working 20% less if is just a ballpark estimate.

Now a proportion of people probably want to work more hours (as happens at the moment with overtime etc) but the whole concept of a fulltime job which means that many people in many sectors of industry work the conventional number of hours, means that the labour market is to some extent inflexible. Similar to the concept of sticky wages (where workers strongly dislike paycuts, so wages tend to stagnate or increase, but rarely to decrease) which can cause problems adjusting to a recession, sticky working hours probably has a similar effect.  

So sticky working hours might mean that companies keep people on for 40 hours a week even though they only need them for 30 hours a week.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"There's too much I can really say here, so I'm gonna trim it to a very brief point;

The UK is like the America of Europe, except increasingly isolationist and with rapidly decreasing relevancy. The people have this idea that they're some mighty country that is simply by nature better than every other alternative out there, that it doesn't need anyone and that you're the greater partner in the grand relationship that is the EU.

In short, you don't accept the fact that there are other countries in Europe, particularly the mainland, that are better off than you are and are in a superior bargaining position. That translates into a myriad of feelings being manifested amongst the population, often with offensive and ignorant statements. 

But let's ignore that. Let's say, that the UK is *the* great country in Europe and that the people have reason to lord it over us. Now, how do you think *we* feel? 

How do you think a Romanian feels, sitting at home and then turning on the TV one day to hear the latest insult coming out of the UK? That their countries are shit and the people in those countries are uneducated shits and they should stay in their shitty country with their shitty lives and not come over to the glorious United Kingdom and shit it up? 

And that's a legitimately held opinion in the UK right now. How do you think Eastern Europeans feel that you think of them as inferior, both as nations and as people? 

So, you've already pissed off like half the EU. 

Then we get to the rest of Europe; Spain and Portugal where their entire experience of British people is them coming over on holidays and shitting the place up, or old/middle aged couples coming over there to retire. OK, no big deal, but why is it that these people talk about how great their country is but then come over here and do this? 

And then there's just the standard Britain-France rivalry.

And then you have Belgium, which has Brussels, essentially the capital of the European Union and pretty much Belgium's claim to political relevancy. Why would they be supportive of a people who's main pastime is ragging on an institution that they're proud of? 

The problem with the UK is that the people in it find a way to be offensive to the majority of the people in the EU, one way or another. This, combined with what can only be described as a population-wide superiority complex - a misplaced one - and just general ignorance on who's responsible for what in your country, it just comes out as something ridiculous altogether.

The constant rhetoric and perpetual media attention given to people extremely critical of everything not British is not helping the country's image in the rest of Europe, and the general consensus is that the British want to have their cake and eat it, too; Essentially have all the positives with none of the negatives.

It's like we're in an American Highschool and the United Kingdom is just over there in the corner singing and dancing about how he's the King of the Castle, and the rest of us are just there looking at you asking what the fuck you're doing. And when the rest of us don't join in you get all pissy and talk about how you're not gonna be our friend anymore if we don't play along, and it's like, seriously, if this is how you're gonna be, just fuck off.

For one thing, you talk as if the current situation was entered into freely and happily whereas the reality is the EU has evolved far beyond its original blueprint and member states have often found themselves forced to accept policies they would not wish to in order to avoid losing out in other ways. There's also the fact that EU agreements have often been sold as one thing and then turned out to work differently in practice, and that this has often been due to the political manoeuvres of federalist or anti-federalist factions. The EU has problems, and the UK has never been shy about voicing its concerns. That is something that should be appreciated as important and useful engagement from a leading member state (even if you disagree) and not belittled as if standing up for the national interest is an outdated and irritating habit that noone else engages in.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"You're fundamentally misunderstanding the implications of the chemical weapons deal. It was a face-saving measure on Obama's part. He made a red line and never had any intention of enforcing it. He knew that a military attack in Syria would be politically unpopular, but he drew that red line expecting that the Syrians wouldn't use their chemical weapons. When they did (probably *because* they knew Obama was bluffing and this would easily embarrass him), Obama needed a way to get out of a politically unpopular military strike. Because to him, the priority is not our strategic interest or upholding the word of the USA, but being popular and keeping his polling numbers as high as possible. 

Russia saw this as an opportunity. Obama needed to avoid a military strike on Syria, and Russia and Syria also wanted to avoid that possibility. Syria, furthermore, had huge stocks of (mostly expired) chemical weapons. Striking a deal with the US was a slam dunk for the Russians and their Syrian clients: Syria avoids a military strike and gets rid of expired, worthless chemical weapons (and the US pays for it), Obama is humiliated because his word is demonstrated to be worthless, and Russia demonstrates to its own (mostly dictatorial) client states that unlike the US (which summarily dumped Egyptian dictator Mubarak on his ass), Russia *would* defend its client states' leaders. In what way was this a success for America? It seems to me that this was a huge success for Russia and Syria, and only massive spinning on the part of the administration could make it seem otherwise. 

Given that Syria appears to have used chlorine gas now (meaning the whole farce of removing chemical weapons was pointless), it seems that number 2 would have been the best option. If you have no intention of actually doing anything to stop a given conflict, number 2 is what governments should do: condemn the violence, but make neither promises not demands. Yes, it is weak: but it is not *as* weak as making demands and failing to see then through. All of our allies could understand us taking option 2 (even if the directly-involved allies like Saudi Arabia would be peeved with us not working with them), but nobody is pleased when we start making promises to allies (even tentative allies like the Syrian moderates) and then failing to back them up. That makes us unreliable. An unreliable ally is an unpredictable ally, and nothing is worse for world stability than unpredictability.

&gt;__Social Darwinism__ is a modern name given to various theories of society that emerged in [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) and the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) in the 1870s, and which allegedly sought to apply biological concepts of [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection) and [survival of the fittest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest) to sociology and politics.   Social Darwinists generally argue that the strong should see their wealth and power increase while the weak should see their wealth and power decrease. Different social Darwinists have different views about which groups of people are *the strong* and *the weak*, and they also hold different opinions about the precise mechanism that should be used to promote strength and punish weakness. Many such views stress competition between individuals in *[laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire)* [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism), while others motivated ideas of [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics), [racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism), [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism),  [fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism), [Nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism) and struggle between national or racial groups.

That's a massive reason people vote UKIP. The European elections have always been won by the official Opposition in the UK. Until 2014, when UKIP won.

There have been some cases where the parents mutilate the children when they are babies (usually burns) so that they would make more money by begging because people would feel sorry for them. The reason that they use their own kids is because the police cannot convict minors. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LygemtaJIQ8) is a BBC documentary made in Spain.

That being said, it's important to note that not every gypsy does this. They are humans as well and 99% love their kids enough to not use them in that way. Sadly, the 1% (probably more than 1%, but I can't just  come up with a random big figure as I feel it would be inappropriate) of them are a reality which needs to stop.

Btw., that's one reason why it was abolished, aside from that large numbers of cannon fodder with little training simply wasn't the requirement in a post-Cold War world anymore. Only drafting a few unlucky ones simply wasn't fair, and put them at a disadvantage.

Not all people in the church are bad, but as long as the catholic church does not take proper measures in dealing with its past and the rot within its organisation I just cannot take them seriously.

Of course not. In some nations bribery does work - in some it doesn't. If you even try to bribe in Sweden you're going to end up in jail, even if you're a multimillionaire. Guess where it's easiest to bribe or rather expected? Yup, in communist states.

&gt; And? You think Capitalism only exists as a result of stocks?

No, but it's a big contributing factor. However I haven't claimed anything is a result of anything. I said joint-stock trading was invented by never really developed until the 19th century. Merchants and joint-stock trading is hardly the type of capitalism we see today. It's like saying ""ohh well people worked together during the bronze age, of course they invented socialism"".

&gt; Capitalism - or if we're going on your absurd, nonexistent definition of absolutely unregulated and uncontrolled Capitalism, then we can say Capitalistic tendencies - has been around for centuries.

I haven't claimed that and you know I haven't. 

&gt; It's had its time and place and it was useful then for that precise reason. Not anymore.

Somehow I believe more in capitalism than communism. Mainly because communism is oppressive.

&gt; Of course I do. I can thank them for everything I have today. Absolutely. That doesn't mean it isn't a fundamentally exploitative system and that it shouldn't be dismantled.

&gt; We can thank the Chinese government for enforcing cheap labour so I can afford all this shit, that doesn't mean I should like the Chinese government or that I should like how they treat their workers.

Without them you'd still farm potatoes with a rake was what I was refering to.

&gt; No.

So you believe Marx was wrong?

&gt; No.

Well that surely made your case.

&gt; That's the most patently absurd and moronic thing I've ever seen. No. Just no. Learn what the fuck Communism is. Fucking hell.

&gt; No.

Ohh what a shocker - So who will?

&gt; Never.

Well of course the wikipedia page is wrong and you're 100% correct.

&gt; There is no Capitalism currently taking place(Despite the fact it is)

I haven't said there isn't, I just said it's not responsible for everything bad in the world like you claim.

&gt; The USA is Communist, and so is Russia and China. The logic of this stance is totally absurd, so I don't understand it.

This sign: ? means it's a question. I wanted to know just exactly how skewed your worldview is.

&gt; That Socialism is authoritarianism because it isn't Capitalism

Communism and socialism, suddenly they're the same.

&gt; Despite the fact Socialism ends Corporate Slavery

[Totally did.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag)

&gt; That you deny that there is increasing global monopoly and increasing economic stagnation, despite every single sign indicating otherwise.

You have no proof for your claim. Capitalism does not cause stagnation - stupid banks do. Indirectly this is caused by faulty lawmaking.

&gt; You believe that Capitalism does pay workers what they are worth, because Capitalism says so.

You should take an economics 101 class sometime, then you can perhaps understand some of the things we've discussed.

&gt; You deny that Capitalism is centuries old. 

It was ""invented"" by merchants. They went from village to village to sell/buy stuff. They later invented joint-stock trading to reduce the risk of over seas trading. This is hardly the modern concept of capitalism we have today.

&gt; Someone should probably tell the slaves shipped off to the Caribbean and Americas for the Sugar and Tobacco industry that it wasn't so prices could be cheaper and companies could make bigger profits. I guess the India Trade Companies didn't exist either.

You actually believe people would've gone ""Slaves? Nah we don't need labour"" back then?

&gt; Or the thousands upon thousands of other industries. Or banks. Nope, no Capitalism.

Banks use capitalism, and so do businesses. What's your point?

The bad: 

* Caught the flu in basic training. The (mostly conscripts in their late twenties) army doctors and nurses were totally incompetent. By the time I was referred to a military hospital with real, actual medical staff it had developed to the early stages of pneumonia. That was a fun  couple of weeks.

* Training was a joke. 4 weeks of parade marching and (very basic) drill in Basic training + 2 weeks (if that) of ""advanced recruit training school"" (aka basic infantry combat tactics) + maybe 10 hours of ""specialization"" training. To illustrate why i put ""specialization"" in quotes: On paper, I am supposed to be an operator of a particular (somewhat complicated) comms system. The actual hands-on time I got with said system during my 9 months of service was about 20 minutes. And that was because a Sgt. took personal initiative to actually train some of us.

* Most of the 7 and a half months remaining after training was spent on cleaning, basic maintenance (aka painting walls and mowing grass/weeds around the base) and sentry/patrol/MP duty. We were generally understaffed, so practically every day on duty had 2 to 4 hours of sentry/patrol assignments at night, leading to some heavy sleep deprivation after a while.

If you actually read my argument above, you'd see that I said ""I'm fully aware that the European Council is itself democratically legitimate.""

&gt;That's an issue at the member state level, surely. But if we are going to use that as a reason to delegitimise the European Council, let's be fair and point out that the single leading reason for member states having interim leaders is the Euro crisis brought about by the enthusiasm for political union of people like Juncker. Seems to me that your argument rebounds on itself.

Of course it's a Member State issue. That's how the European Council is formed. You overstate the relevance of the eurocrisis to a lot of individual imterim governments.

Well it was my final point, so it *should* be scraping the bottom of the barrel. In any event, mandates do fade over time, that's why they eventually end. You really only have to observe any Government beginning to crack late in its mandate to see this.

&gt;I simply put the counterpoint: just because the European Parliament has some democratic legitimacy, it doesn't mean that a) it is as democratically legitimate as it should be

Irrelevant.

&gt;or b) that it can be considered more (or equally) legitimate than the governments of member states who must ultimately have primacy due to the very nature of the EU as a treaty organisation based on the idea of subsidiarity.

The European Council is not the governments of the Member States, it's an EU body composed of ex offico members. Those two things are entirely different.

It was a worldwide financial collapse, Gordon Brown actually dealt with it quite well which is one of the few things labour did well IMO. 

&gt;A lot of the EU doesn't want a federation. Just one of the reasons Eurosceptics did so well in this election.

It's not ""a lot of the EU"" whatever that means, ""eurosceptics"" are still a small minority in the EP thankfully. Either way, the goal of the EU is to become a federation and all states know this. 

&gt;You think its only the UK in this? The very article we are commenting on has Sweden and Hungary also supporting Cameron. 

The article makes no mention of Hungary, Sweden or the Netherlands. Besides, Hungary is currently governed by anti-semite fascists and the quotation you gave on The Netherlands was by a politician that is not in power and is [pro-Federalist](http://www.social-europe.eu/2014/04/gobbledygook-federalism-contra-nation-state/), he was just saying certain things need to be kept at the level of the state which is obvious. 

As for the Scandinavians, they just want the rest of Europe to catch up before becoming a federation. 

So finally, the UK is infamous for keeping the EU from advancing [purely on its own](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16104275) which is quite annoying and frankly if they want to leave just do it, I have no problem with that. Join the EEA like Norway and Swtizerland oh wait they can't do that either, I don't know go make another empire, it's what it sounds like they want.

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Are you oblivious to the fact that it was the financial sector that caused the crisis?

Of course it was, but that doesn't mean that being a financial centre is a bad business model. Far from it. [As this shows,](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/regional-trends/regional-economic-indicators/march-2013/sum-london.html) London fared much better during the crisis than anywhere else in the UK. The resilience of a financial sector is one of the reasons why.

&gt; it creates an extremely polarised society, as is the case with London.

This is too simplistic. You're overlooking Help to Buy, the reluctance of the British government to build new houses, and perhaps most importantly, British tax laws vis-a-vis foreign ownership.

&gt; Germany is doing much better than the UK, they never had a crisis in the first place.

The German economy is bigger and certainly weathered the crisis much better. Saying they didn't have a crisis is absurd though. If you'll recall the amount of work Merkel put in to save the Euro, they clearly experienced a very real crisis. However, as has been oft repeated recently, the UK [is now Europe's fastest growing economy,](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10597418/UK-confirmed-as-fastest-growing-economy-in-Western-Europe.html) 4x faster than Germany's in 2013 in fact.

How much of the EU do you think really wants a federation right now? If it was a sizeable amount then we'd be seeing a hell of a lot more of it being mentioned. Right now leaders tip-toe around the issue.

&gt; the quotation you gave on The Netherlands was by a politician that is not in power and is pro-Federalist

Frans Timmermans is the current Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs. [Here.](http://www.government.nl/government/members-of-cabinet/frans-timmermans) And yes, I'm aware of his views. These have had to change, hence why the view I linked to was announced on the official Dutch government web site. That's not the view of a single individual, its representative of the incumbent Dutch government.

&gt; The article makes no mention of Hungary, Sweden or the Netherlands.

My apologies, it doesn't. [Others however, do.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/01/cameron-juncker-politicise-european-commission-eu)

&gt; As for the Scandinavians, they just want the rest of Europe to catch up before becoming a federation.

Where has that been mentioned?

&gt; So finally, the UK is infamous for keeping the EU from advancing purely on its own

The deal you link to was renegotiated and passed. [Here.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-16104089) That's how the EU works. Stuff is renegotiated a lot, because its hard to satisfy all 28 member states.

And with regards to the UK acting on its own, this is the veto. All countries have it and all use it. It is a necessary part of the Union. France uses it with regards to CAP reform or stopping the Parliament's trips to Strasbourg. Why? Because it is not beneficial to France. You're placing a ridiculous amount of blame on the UK alone.

true,MrKnot,null,null,"&gt; quale sono le possibilite d'insegnare en italia?

They are rather slim. At the moment, there is virtually a complete freeze on hiring both at the university and at the high school level.

&gt; My italian is not good enough to teach now, but it will be at the end of the summer.

With all encouragement for your studies, realistically it won't be. I'm sure you'll manage to get across to your students, but in any selection process you'll be hugely disadvantaged against native speakers.

&gt; So I was wondering: what kinds of jobs are there teaching maths?

Like I said above, teaching in public institutions is subject to a virtually complete freeze in hiring. Private schools might be hiring, but they employ way fewer teachers than the public system.

&gt; How does the school system work at this level, is it like university professors or like high school teachers?

Sorry, I don't think I understand what you mean here.

&gt; What course levels could I teach with a B.Sc. in Mathematics and M.A. in Education?

If you get your degrees recognized in Italy, you could certainly teach high school. University teaching jobs are almost exclusively connected to research activity, in technical fields there are no people hired exclusively for teaching AFAIK, not even for the more basic courses.

Sorry for the let down, but the teaching situation in Italy truly is pretty dismal in terms of job market, job security, pay and working conditions. Howeer, I do have a suggestion: I know there are high schools, mostly private, that offer courses taught in English.

true,atred,ROMA,Romanian-born American,"&gt;He made a red line and never had any intention of enforcing it.

How do you know it? Maybe I'm naive, but to me it was pretty evident that he wanted to bomb Syria and he would have done it, but the Congress the American public were not very supportive and the deal also popped up at the last minute. The bombing of Syria was averted in the last minute, not the losing face of Obama. Believe me, if it was between losing face and bombing Syria no matter how coward Fox News convinced you that Obama is, he would not have had any issue to start bombing Assad's ass. Your narrative doesn't make (common) sense.

&gt;Given that Syria appears to have used chlorine gas now (meaning the whole farce of removing chemical weapons was pointless)

Chlorine gas is a totally different kind of chemical agent than sarin, VX, or mustard gas. ""Chlorine is not on the list of prohibited toxic chemicals by the Chemical Weapons Convention because it is a common industrial, albeit  toxic, chemical."" even more, there's apparently no conclusive proof (yet) that the Assad regime used it.

So you basically say that the best option is to say that is bad and not do anything about it, at least Obama did something about it. It's disingenuous to say that ""Syria avoids a military strike and gets rid of expired, worthless chemical weapons"". They already removed all the mustard gas from Syria and they destroyed 92.5% of its declared chemical stockpile. ""On October 31 the OPCW announced that it had met the deadline for destroying all declared equipment and facilities related to chemical weapons production, having visited 21 out of 23 sites, and received assurances from the Syrian government that the other two sites had been abandoned and emptied of chemicals and equipment, with these dispersed to sites visited by the OPCW. The two sites were unreachable due to being in contested areas of the ongoing civil war."" 

So, if Obama behaved how you liked him to behave Syria would still have mustard gas and capacities to produce CW. Even more, they would use CW massively, sarin, VX, mustard gas, the whole shebang, not using some industrial toxic chemical (1000-2000 times less potent than the real stuff) in a hidden way in only a couple of instances. If US would basically say ""it's bad to use CW, but we'll not do anything about it"" Syria would use CW with impunity, they don't. Sorry, but I prefer Obama's ""leading from behind"" to whatever else you and US conservatives have to sell. 

And again, if Syria is in clear non-compliance Obama has always the option to do something more. ",0,1401668345,null,0,1401680147,0,chwr93l,t3_26ye08,t1_chwr93l,t1_chwnnj5,null,1434052197,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I agree completely. The transatlantic alliance is a net benefit to all parties involved (as well as some third parties).

This article looks like it was intended for domestic readers in the US. The problem we're facing over here is that no US politician wants to look ""weak"" by cutting the military. They also don't want to lose military jobs in their district. This leads to absurd outcomes, like Congress buying weapons that the Pentagon doesn't want.

So this article is trying to reframe the issue by casting defense spending as a military subsidy to Europe. That way, defense cuts would be more political viable. The article has an abrasive tone and skewed numbers, but I wouldn't take it too seriously from an international perspective. It's just political maneuvering during an election year.

Excerpts:

&gt;**Galway historian reveals truth behind 800 orphans in mass grave**
&gt;
&gt;There is a growing international scandal around the history of The Home, a grim 1840’s workhouse in Tuam in Galway [..] that was taken over in 1925 by the Bon Secours sisters, who turned it into a Mother and Baby home for “fallen women.”
&gt;
&gt;The long abandoned site made headlines around the world this week when it was revealed that a nearby septic tank contained the bodies of up to eight hundred infants and children, secretly buried without coffins or headstones on unconsecrated ground between 1925 and 1961.
&gt;
&gt;Now a local historian has stepped forward to outline the terrible circumstances around so many lost little lives.
&gt;
&gt;Catherine Corless, the local historian and genealogist, remembers the Home Babies well. “They were always segregated to the side of regular classrooms,” Corless tells IrishCentral. “By doing this the nuns telegraphed the message that they were different and that we should keep away from them. 
&gt;
&gt;“They didn’t suggest we be nice to them. In fact if you acted up in class some nuns would threaten to seat you next to the Home Babies. That was the message we got in our young years,” Corless recalls. [..]
&gt;
&gt;Surrounded by an eight-foot high wall, Tuam, County Galway locals say that they saw little to nothing of the daily life of The Home or of the pregnant young mothers who arrived and left it without a word over the decades. [..]
&gt;
&gt;A local health board inspection report from April 1944 recorded 271 children and 61 single mothers in residence, a total of 333 in a building that had a capacity for 243.
&gt;
&gt;The report described the children as “emaciated,” “pot-bellied,” “fragile” with “flesh hanging loosely on limbs.” The report noted that 31 children in the “sun room and balcony” were “poor, emaciated and not thriving.” The effects of long term neglect and malnutrition were observed repeatedly. 
&gt;
&gt;Children died at The Home at the rate of one a fortnight for almost 40 years, one report claims. [..] In The Home’s 36 years of operation between 1926 and 1961 some locals told the press this week of unforgettable interactions with its emaciated children, who because of their “sinful” origins were considered socially radioactive and treated as such.
&gt;
&gt;One local said: “I remember some of them in class in the Mercy Convent in Tuam – they were treated marginally better than the traveler children. They were known locally as the “Home Babies.” For the most part the children were usually gone by school age – either adopted or dead.”
&gt;
&gt;Because of Corless’ efforts we now know the names and fates of up to 796 forgotten infants and children who died there, thanks to her discovery of their death records when researching The Home’s history. [..]
&gt;
&gt;Corless believes that nothing was said or done to expose the truth because people believed illegitimate children didn’t matter. “That’s what really hurts and moved me to do something,” she explains.
&gt;
&gt;During its years of operation the children of The Home were referred to as “inmates” in the press. It was believed by the clergy that the harsh conditions there were in themselves a form of corrective penance. The state, the church and their families all failed these women, Corless contends. 
&gt;
&gt;But even now the unexpected difficulty that the local committee Corless has joined to fundraise for a plaque to remember the dead children suggests that not everyone wants to confront the truth about the building's tragic past. “I do blame the Catholic Church,” says Corless. “I blame the families as well but people were afraid of the parish priest. [..]
&gt;
&gt;It was a different time, some defenders argued this week, omitting to mention that the stigmatizing silence that surrounded The Home was fostered by clerics. [..]

&gt;Là-dessus, la Grande-Bretagne a posé sa candidature au Marché Commun. Elle l'a fait après s'être naguère refusée à participer à la Communauté qu'on était en train de bâtir. Et puis ensuite après avoir créé une zone de libre échange avec six autres Etats, et puis enfin après avoir, je peux bien le dire, on se rappelle les négociations qui ont été menées si longuement à ce sujet, après avoir fait quelques pressions sur les six, pour empêcher que ne commence réellement l'application du marché commun. Enfin l'Angleterre a demandé à son tour à y entrer mais suivant ses propres conditions. Cela pose sans aucun doute à chacun des six Etats et ça pose à l'Angleterre des problèmes d'une très grande dimension. L'Angleterre, en effet elle, est insulaire. Elle est maritime. Elle est liée par ses échanges, ses marchés, ses ravitaillements aux pays les plus divers, et souvent les plus lointains. Elle exerce une activité essentiellement industrielle et commerciale, et très peu agricole. Elle a dans tout son travail des habitudes et des traditions très marquées, très originales. Bref, la nature, la structure qui sont propres à l'Angleterre diffèrent profondément de celle des continentaux. Comment faire pour que l'Angleterre telle qu'elle vit, telle qu'elle produit, telle qu'elle échange, soit incorporée au Marché commun tel qu'il a été conçu et tel qu'il fonctionne. Par exemple, les moyens par lesquels se nourrit le peuple de la Grande-Bretagne et qui est en fait l'importation de denrées alimentaires achetées à bon marché dans les deux Amériques. ou dans les anciens Dominions, tout en donnant, en accordant des subventions considérables aux agriculteurs anglais. Ce moyen-là est évidemment incompatible avec le système que les six ont établi tout naturellement pour eux-mêmes. Le système des six ça consiste à faire tout avec les produits agricoles de toute la Communauté. A fixer rigoureusement leur prix. A interdire qu'on les subventionne. A organiser leur consommation entre tous les participants. Et à imposer à chacun de ces participants de verser à la Communauté toute économie qu'il ferait en faisant venir du dehors des aliments au lieu de manger ce qu'offre le marché commun. Encore une fois, comment faire entrer l'Angleterre telle qu'elle est dans ce système-là. On a pu croire, parfois que nos amis Anglais, en posant leur candidature sur le Marché Commun acceptaient de se transformer eux-mêmes au point de s'appliquer toutes les conditions qui sont acceptées et pratiquées par les six. Mais la question est de savoir si la Grande-Bretagne actuellement peut se placer avec le Continent et comme lui à l'intérieur d'un tarif qui soit véritablement commun. De renoncer à toutes préférences à l'égard du Commonwealth. De cesser de prétendre que son agriculture soit privilégiée. Et encore, de tenir pour caducs les engagements qu'elle a pris avec les pays qui ont fait partie, qui faisaient partie, ou qui font partie de sa zone de libre échange. Cette question-là c'est toute la question. On ne peut pas dire qu'elle soit actuellement résolue. Est-ce qu'elle le sera un jour ? Seule évidemment l'Angleterre peut répondre.

Sort of. I'm not a fan of Basic Income because it's an extremely inefficient answer and doesn't really solve any problems. 

Essentially, if we introduced a Basic Income, the effect would be the same as an increase in Minimum Wage. Inflation would rise and the Basic Income would have to be perpetually increased to keep up with it. 

In order to make Basic Income be on par with the Welfare systems it replaces, the government would either drive itself into unsustainable levels of debt or have to raise taxes and cut back on all public services. We just get to the point where, yeah, there's no such thing as people with absolutely no money anymore, but if you want to play everyone in the country a living wage by default, all you're going to do is drive up prices and today's living wage will not be the living wage of tomorrow.

Essentially, for Basic Income to work, the government would have to find a way to prevent massive market inflation while simultaneously cutting back and raising taxes. How? I don't know how they'd manage that. Maybe if they tax it high enough they'll take enough money out of circulation to cancel out the inflation effect, but that'll just piss off the middle class, who wont benefit from Basic Income at all.

Ausgerechnet ein Grüner ist gegen das rotierende Mandat?

Der Mann kennt anscheinend nicht die Geschichte seiner eigenen Partei:

&gt;Das Rotationsprinzip wurde in Deutschland von der Partei Die Grünen seit den erstmaligen Erfolgen bei Kommunalwahlen 1978 angewendet. Nach diesem Verfahren wurden alle Parteiämter in turnusmäßigen Abständen neu besetzt, um einer Ämterhäufung und etwaigem Machtmissbrauch entgegenzuwirken. 

&gt;Dieses basisdemokratische Prinzip sollte auch gemäß dem Bundesprogramm von 1980 stets auf alle Bundestags- und Landtagsmandate ausgeweitet werden, um die Bildung des Berufspolitikertums zu verhindern oder zumindest zu erschweren.

In that case, again, you don't understand what it means for a sovereign to issue its own currency. 

&gt; An just because countries ""didn't have a debt problem then"" or ""they always had a debt problem"" doesn't mean ""we can ignore their debt problem now"".

Let me spell out the logic for you: If Italy had low deficits in the period leading to the crisis, how is it logical to interpret its problems as a lack of fiscal discipline? If Portugal had low debt in the period before the crisis, how is it logical to interpret its problems as a lack of fiscal discipline? If Spain had low deficits and low debt in the period leading to the crisis, how the hell can you even bring it up as an example of lack of fiscal discipline? 

Just please, read what you write to yourself once and think about it before you press save. It's not my fault that you don't want to accept reality for what it is. ",0,1401675858,null,0,false,0,chwuhlk,t3_271pwa,t1_chwuhlk,t1_chwudav,null,1434053720,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2
