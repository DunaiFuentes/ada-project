Problem is said referendum would end up with a huge yes for independence for many reasons: most important one being that a huge lot of Spanish unionists will refuse to vote so as to not legitimate what they see as an illegal process, and there are also plenty of people who are perfectly ok in Spain but won't really care that much if Catalonia becomes its own country so why vote.

And this is the hard truth many Catalonian secessionists refuse to acknowledge, the fact that anything less than an 80% participation with a rotund 80% in favour of independence is going to be ignored in Spain. Either because the results don't reflect the mind of the whole population, or because a 55% in favour of independence doesn't justify breaking up the country. That's one of the reasons minors and immigrants would be able to vote in the referendum: that way the numbers are artificially bigger. And that's only if the referendum happens, mind you! Because most chances are Rajoy and Mas will end up reaching an agreement soon. As they always do.

Also this article points at something I'm tired of talking about: the world doesn't really care about Catalonian independence, in fact they might be even against it because it rocks the status quo and unnecessarily puts into question the economic future of the Eurozone (who's going to pay Spain's debt? How? Is Catalonia going to go back to the Peseta and what does that mean for their debt?).

There are two issues here.

1) No British person voted for Junker, yet he is in charge.

This is quite similar to the situation in the UK at the moment and Scottish independence. One very common argument of the SNP is that very few Scottish people voted Conservative and yet we have a Conservative prime minister. In the case of Junker it's even worse. Since no British party was a member of Junker's group, I think I'm correct in saying that absolutely nobody in the UK voted for Junker.

Now, to me, democracy means accepting the tyranny of the majority. But I would hardly describe such objections as surreal, nor would I characterise them as undemocratic. Certainly such language is not commonly used when considering the case for Scottish independence. And in this case, it's not just a state where Junker lost. It's a state where he wasn't even a candidate.

2) The British people chose a leader, and it's Cameron

Cameron has far greater democratic legitimacy than Junker, in the UK at least, because he won the General Election, which is the single most important election in Britain. And as far as the British electorate are concerned Cameron is in charge. For Cameron to be overruled - i.e. for the democratically expressed will of Britain to be disregarded - is not a good thing. Everyone in Britain knows that Cameron is the Prime Minister. But suddenly they are told that they elected Junker - a person that they've never even heard of - so Cameron can get stuffed?

Again, I don't see how this is such a surreal argument. They've got a point. The British people elected Cameron.

There's no easy answer to either of these conundrums. You've got two power structures - national parliament and EU parliament - competing for supremacy. It's difficult to say that one is right and the other wrong. They are both elected.",0,1403524033,null,0,1403525011,0,cierdvj,t3_28uxir,t1_cierdvj,t1_cieq9jl,null,1434363631,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Caveats: You need to have a passport (or German ID) to do the Postident and it takes around 2 days for the account to open and 2 weeks until you get your EC card. If you can not get an account from an internet bank I would suggest either Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank or Hypovereinsbank because they have a lot of ATMs across Germany (and Hypovereinsbank in other countries as well) and they also have partnerships with other banks so that you can draw money from their ATMs too (I personally have Commerzbank where you can also get money from Postbanks, which are even in the small villages.)

I thought the figures should be relative to population size and total accumulated immigration in relation to population size, you know, how a rational person would see it.


Furthermore, Lebanon and Syria are culturally nearly interchangeable, it's like Austrians moving to Germany or vice versa, there is minimal friction, there would be no significant other issues than the numbers even if they needed to stay.

Taking such numbers into culturally different areas, for instance Israel accepting those refugees, the issues would be quite overwhelming, especially if they decided to stay.

If we consider ourselves democrats we can't be against people deciding what they want to do.

But Spanish law doesn't work that way. During the Transición we kind of reached this consensus that tried to keep everybody more or less happy: Spain remains one country but we now have an autonomic system that's sort of a defacto federal one without economic competencies (except for the Basques, because they supported the right king back in the 18th century). With that in mind, the Constitution was written making sure the autonomic system was in place and nobody got any stupid ideas.

The end result is that both the Constitution and the law give every single tool and right to the central government to stop any secessionist process and if the Catalonian secessionists want to make that referendum, they'll have to break the law to do it because there is just no legislation they can use to achieve their goals.

If anything, recent history has been about moves towards the nation state, rather than the other way round, with democracy meaning that people tend to choose self-determination along national lines rather than surpranational lines.

Even if the world were to divide into unions, this still doesn't mean it makes sense for the UK to be in the EU. The UK can keep good relations with various unions around the world.

&gt; Privately, a lot of European governments understand that the institutions of Europe need reform, that they [need] more investment into Europe, that Europe needs to better connect as a union with the people on this continent.

So people are saying that you need to respect the result of the elections? right?

&gt; ""I was talking to the prime minister the other day and he said there are a load of countries there who share his view on this, they think this is the wrong man,... But this is the problem with the EU. It's locked in this ridiculous process that because they took a decision before the elections they must somehow stand by that.""

Honestly, expecting politicians to stand by their word, whatever next!

Nope, apparently what we need is more back-room deals. No need for accountability here....


&gt; Cameron has said the spitzenkandidaten system threatens the power of the EU's 28 heads of government in the European council, who were given the power in the Lisbon treaty to nominate the commission president, taking account of the European elections.

The main concern is that the Council can't neuter the Comission as it did in the past...

&gt; Cameron has said the spitzenkandidaten system threatens the power of the EU's 28 heads of government in the European council, who were given the power in the Lisbon treaty to nominate the commission president, taking account of the European elections.

Because respecting the vote of the population isn't a good reason apparently.....

&gt; The prime minister is arguing from a position of principle about getting the right people and making sure the right people choose the leader of the European commission.

Maybe we should do the same thing when the General election comes around, ""You got the majority, but we don't think you're the right candidate for PM, and FPTP means you aren't legitimate anyway, I think we should choose someone else...""

&gt;If they give Jean-Claude Juncker a job this is like literally flicking two fingers at the rest of Europe and saying to all the people out there: 'We know that you voted the way you did but you are wrong and we are just going to show you how wrong you are by carrying on as though nothing happened.'

You can see how people voted, by looking at the makeup of the EP, PR does that for you. 

The biggest group is the EPP, and the Eurosceptics make up at most 10% of the parliament, and that 10% is fractured (Farge on the one side, Le Pen in the NIs on the other).

Juncker wasn't my choice for Comission President, but people have voted, and the job should be his. Doing anything else would be 'flciking two fingers at the rest of Europe'.

I am arguing his way to pretend the correct way to estimate acceptable levels of immigration is by relating to the total immigration around the world, which is a preposterous concept.

Furthermore are you arguing that a neighbouring country which is culturally nearly interchangeable would be a worse choice than say a distant European country for these immigrants?


Also isn't the point that these people move back home afterwards, to allow them to fix their country, the idea isn't to just keep moving people away but to fix the conflicted countries in the end.


Mass immigration to Europe isn't a solution for any of the issues, I don't understand how you people think it is.


I'm acting?

Germans moving to Austria to study isn't a problem, I don't understand how you think it is.

In case of an evacuation from Germany for whatever reason, are you saying say, Israel or the US. would be a better target for German immigrants than Austria, they speak the language, essentially know the customs and social conduct, from where they can quickly move back home when necessary later?

L'Argentine avait la possibilité (théorique) d'émettre des contrats qui soient, d'une part, de droit argentin, et d'autre part libellés en pesos.

Pourquoi alors ne l'a-t-elle pas fait ? Tout simplement parce que personne de sensé ne prendrait part a de tels contrats, au vu de la très longue histoire d'ingérence systématique du pouvoir politique argentin dans les affaires économiques et la banque centrale.

Du coup, l'Argentine est plus ou moins obligée d'émettre des contrats américains (ou dans tous les cas dans une juridiction qui protège les investisseurs), libellés en dollars (ou autre monnaie forte). C'est une façon de convaincre les investisseurs, en leur disant : ""vous voyez, c'est du costaud, vous êtes protégés par le droit américain"".

Blaming the Eurocrisis on slow integration couldn't be more simplistic if it tried. Though I see your point and agree the slow nature of integration made the crisis worse. Funnily enough, you blame the UK for much of these failures, whilst your example of the Eurocrisis didn't involve the UK at all. 

&gt; One swift blow would be better

What is a swift blow? Completely empowering the EP versus domestic parliaments? Empowering the Commission or Council President over Member State leaders (in a decade that means Juncker's - lets just assume its him for simplicity - replacement)? No Member State politician or leader is going to accept dramatically reducing their powers in such a way.

Go beyond the purely political, lets say that move is empowering the EU to control tax levels. That's going to be opposed by a whole host of nations. Or banking secrecy laws (Austria calls these part of its culture).

Move to the military. A European military cannot be created in such short notice. Germany is too pacifist to allow its troops to fight wherever the French, British or (increasingly) Polish would like to see them fight. That's one example. Are neutral countries like Ireland and Sweden willing to completely break their neutrality (not to mention becoming nuclear armed nations by virtue of the EU being a nuclear power thanks to France/UK.

true,WelshDwarf,WALE,Wales,"

&gt; Also, Junker has to make a lot of concessions to get support from the majority of the parliament, so he can't just push United States of Europe over everyone's heads without resistance if he gets chosen. It's not like it's guaranteed he will manage to get a majority in the parliament either. (I'd rather see one of the other candidates succeed but I think it's fair to give Junker the first show.)

Juncker's support from the EP mainly stems from the fact that the EPP has the most seats and he's the EPP's candidate. In the interest of democracy, he should get the first shot at the job. It doesn't mean he wont face stiff resistance if he tries to act up. After all, the EPP doesn't have anything near a majority.

It's also in the EP's (and Europe's) interest that the idea of the President of the Comission being chosen, even indirectly, by the voting public rather than appointed by 28 a committee of people.

&gt; Though, I can see the UK public not being too used to how coalitions work given that they have FPTP elections where as little as 35% of the vote have been enough for a majority government.)

In their defence, the British public can't have voted for Juncker, since no party present in the UK elections were part of the EPP (the Tories had the brilliant idea in 2009 that to gain more influence, they should form their own gang instead of being number 3 in the EPP).

&gt; ... Her long hair, still wet from the shower, had been combed down her back in a wet swath. Hilda was sitting on the floor, her round, wet boobs still wet from the shower's water. She dried off the water with a towel, which then became wet.  
Hilda gasped when she saw a reflection in her bedroom mirror: through the slightly open door, she caught a glimpse of the chiseled abs and square jaw of the mysterious stranger who shared her cabin. She stood and spun around, her breasts swinging heavily with the momentum. She grabbed the door and flung it open, revealing shirtless Torolf (which was seriously his name) quivering with desire in the hallway.  
Torolf was ashamed at being caught, but his shame made him even hotter – hotter for sex. He stepped into the room, and his bulging abs accidentally smushed into Hilda's rich chest.  
As Hilda's buttermilk bosoms squished up against his granite abs, Torolf almost had a dick aneurysm.  
""Hilda,"" Torolf murmured thickly, his throbbing meat wand pressing against Hilda's warm thighs. ""There is a secret I need to not tell you: You are my forbidden desire.""  
Hilda had been waiting to hear these words. Her heart was lifted on golden wings and soared toward a radiant sun of perfect joy. She saw herself and Torolf happy together, bathed in the golden light of love. Her snooch got all warm, too.  
""Torolf,"" Hilda moaned, her lush teats straining with desire. ""I need you.""  
Torolf, coarse abs pulsing softly in the moonlight, stood silently.  
Hilda looked at him expectantly.  
""Oh, sorry,"" she added. ""Torolf, I need you – sexually.""  
At hearing those beautiful words, Torolf flexed his rough-hewn abs and Hilda found herself being guided to her soft bed by the sheer force of Torolf's undulating midsection. She parted her thighs in anticipation, exposing the soft pink petals of her clunge.  
Torolf entered her like she was a lottery. His engorged pecker pushed inside her and she felt fulfilled with sexual fulfillment.  
Hilda clutched at the bedsheets with lust and ecstasy and her hands. Her spongy love mountains hurled to and fro with each pounding. Her body was like a beautiful flower that was opening and somebody was pushing their dick inside it.  
Then Torolf moaned, arched his back, and suffered from dick Parkinson's. He pumped in all of his hot pearlescent sperms as Hilda spasmed with so many orgasms!  
The two lay still for a moment as the stinky scent of lovemaking billowed around the room.  
Hilda got out of bed, still shimmering with orgasm. She glowed with contentment, like a cat who ate the cream of the crop.  
She walked across the room and picked up her towel, still wet with shower water. ""Torolf,"" she said softly, ""there's something I have to tell you...""

Think of it this way:

You are in the position to say this whilst at work, at school or at home.

Your civil liberties and rights are put into law, and can be upheld in a court of law. 

You live in wealth and luxury. You can go to the store and buy as much as you can afford. This includes everything from food to stuff like cars and planes. You have central heating, plumbing, running water, gas, and electricity is always 'just there'. 

You either have a diploma in your field or are on your way to getting one. Or you don't, but you at least have the opportunity to go out and get one, or you had that opportunity and decided to pass on it. 

If you're injured or hurt, you can go to your General Physician or the local hospital and you are treated. That trip to get there can be in an ambulance if it's serious, or you can go there yourself, perhaps even take public transit if it's a minor injury, but it's not a trip that takes days or even weeks.

But when there are so many things wrong with the EU from an administrative point of view, one person can only really say 'we need to renegotiate' and have that accepted before any specific amendments or alterations can be touted. I mean there's no point in going into massive detail about what should change if the EU goliath has no plans to allow any change in the way it is run at all. Any specific manifesto would just be dismissed - 'The EU will continue as it is. There is more to achieve'. That's why right now the only tangible EU-skeptic policy coming out is 'renegotiate' - because until that is firmly on the table, everything else is meaningless. 

I don't want to leave the EU at all, but I also don't think *any* form of government should be allowed to trundle on without any accountability to its citizens. It scares me that there has been a rise of far right, anti-EU, fascist politicians across Europe, but it angers me that the response from the EU hub and the fervently-EU politicians is 'well they're wrong, so let's ignore them'. Whether those voters are ill-advised and uneducated on the issues is irrelevant, just choosing to ignore them because they disagree with the status quo is a vile form of 'democracy'.

A lot of countries are against eurobonds, pretty much all of northern europe, except france. Him trying to work in that direction is only for the benefit of Italy being able to pay lower interest rates and continue with their unbalanced spending. The same is true for ""growth over austerity"". The whole concept is stupid, since long-lasting growth can not be based purely on government spending, it has to be based on private growth, while adhering to a balanced budget.

The immigration reform is unquestionably necessary, but coming from Italy it seems like they just want to lessen their own burden and have other countries shoulder the responsibilty. While it is true, that there should be some help from central european countries, these burdens are inherently harder on the countries that actually are on the border between the EU and the migrating countries. The fact that italien immigration agencies give immigrants some money and a train ticket to nothern Europe - as many immigrants arriving in Germany for example have stated - shows their true intention.

Mi incazzo per un motivo semplice: tutta Italia, i giornali in prima fila, sta spalando merda sui lavoratori di Pompei per aver fatto non solo quanto era loro diritto ma anche loro dovere.

Dico 'dovere' perché i problemi che *finalmente*i lavoratori portano a conoscenza del pubblico nazionale sono gravissimi e pregiudicano non solo il funzionamento corrente del sito ma anche la sua preservazione per la posterità. Lo fanno dopo *anni* in cui hanno tentato la via della mediazione ordinaria (che Polito disonestamente insnua non sia mai stata provata).

Per elencarvi questi problemi voglio usare una fonte che non può essere accusata di parzialità nei confronti dei lavoratori, visto che si trova dal lato opposto della barricata ed è contraria alle azioni sindacali di questi giorni: [Antonio Irlando](http://www.ilmessaggero.it/PRIMOPIANO/CRONACA/pompei_chiusa_assemblea_lavoratori_turisti/notizie/759450.shtml), presidente dell'Osservatorio Patrimonio Culturale. Riporta il Messaggero:

&gt; Infatti, pagare con regolarità gli arretrati di prestazioni svolte dai custodi, adeguare i loro luoghi di lavoro alle norme di salute e sicurezza dei lavoratori, organizzare con maggiore efficienza le prestazioni quotidiane di lavoro, potenziare gli organici di chi deve vigilare sugli scavi di Pompei ricorrendo anche alla mobilità del personale, non sembrano proprio questioni che...

La lista di Irlando elenca i sintomi del principale problema che affligge oggigiorno Pompei: la devastante inadeguatezza dell'organico custodi e delle loro infrastrutture rispetto alle dimensioni e alle necessità del sito.

Pompei è una città vera e propria. Peggio, è una città in rovina: gli edifici non hanno più né porta né finestre originali, il che significa che ci si può (facilmente) muovere non solo fra le strade ma dentro e fuori gli edifici stessi. La superficie che deve essere pattugliata è molto superiore a quella di una città moderna di dimensioni paragonabili, proprio perché anche l'interno delle strutture è aperto.

Già solo la semplice sorveglianza richiede un organico considerevole. Un centinaio di custodi possono sembrare molti o almeno sufficienti, se non si considera che oltre alla sorveglianza delle strade è necessario garantire anche quella degli accessi al sito e la presenza alle biglietterie (di giorno, mentre di notte va garantita la sorveglianza: Pompei è pattugliata 24/7).

Ma il lavoro dei custodi non finisce con la sorveglianza. Per ragioni di conservazione, una buona parte delle strutture di Pompei sono ad accesso limitato: vi si può entrare solo in gruppi insieme a una guida autorizzata. Le *chiavi* dei cancelli che chiudono queste case sono nelle mani dei custodi, che passano *tutto il giorno*, letteralmente, andando da una casa a un'altra per aprirle alle varie guide e poi chiuderle quando il gruppo esce.

Ma non è finita qui. Pompei è un sito archeologico attivo: sono presenti scavi (la città è tutt'altro che completamente dissepolta) e sono presenti, sopratutto, archeologi e storici dell'arte che lavorano su quanto già è stato scavato. Tipicamente, questi archeologi si spostano fra case che sono chiuse per ragioni di conservazione o di sicurezza; i custodi devono garantire anche a questi l'accesso alle case, andando ad aprire e chiudere i cancelli.

Come faccio a sapere tutte queste cose? perché ci ho lavorato. Ho visto con i miei occhi le tabelle organico e i turni, ho visto con i miei occhi *come* lavorano i custodi e di quante cose sono responsabili, ho visto con i miei occhi i turisti comportarsi *continuamente* da teste di cazzo, al punto da rendere completamente autoevidente la necessità di custodi che cerchino di prevenire le peggiori stronzate.

E la verità è che il comparto custodi è terribilmente sotto organico, obbligato da regolamenti demenziali a fare il portachiavi invece che il custode (ma non hanno scelta, i regolamenti non li fanno loro) e completamente insufficiente a garantire anche solo l'apertura delle case per visita (ormai vengono chiuse a turno alcune case che dovrebbero essere aperte, perché non ci sono abbastanza uomini per la sorveglianza). Oltre tutto si prendono anche insulti sanguinosi quando ci sono crolli o altri danneggiamenti, anche se i custodi non hanno assolutamente alcun potere nemmeno preventivo a riguardo.

Se poi vogliamo proprio metterci il carico, le loro strutture di lavoro sono da terzo mondo. L'ufficio centrale è un edificio vecchissimo e fatiscente, senza aria condizionata (e vi assicuro che a Pompei fa *caldo*), con bagni imbarazzanti (gli spogliatoi almeno glieli hanno rifatti e sono ok). Il ponte radio non ha una penetrazione adeguata, di modo che è impossibile muovere i custodi tempestivamente quando si presentano particolari necessità (grossi gruppi etc.). C'è poi una decennale questione di arretrati non pagati per il lavoro notturno, altra infamità.

Alla luce di tutti questi problemi, che perdurano da anni e che vengono sistematicamente ignorati da tutte le sopraintendenze e da ogni ministero, che potrebbero essere risolti con una spesa contenuta e con cambi di regolamento minimali, e che sopratutto METTONO A RISCHIO SIA LA FRUIBILITA' CHE LA PRESERVAZIONE DEL SITO, i lavoratori hanno fatto una cosa giusta e sacrosanta usando il diritto all'assemblea sindacale per guadagnarsi la risonanza mediatica che il problema merita.

AHAAAHAAHAAAHAAHAH

Ma gesù benedetto. Tanto per cominciare, Pompei è sorvegliata 24/7 su 3 turni di 8 ore, quindi non ci sono mai 150 custodi attivi in ogni momento, ma circa 60 (di giorno, di notte sono una trentina).

Quindi, cosa fanno queste 60 persone? Sono responsabili di:

- pattugliare un'area delle dimensioni del centro storico di Bologna, ma in cui la grande maggioranza delle case non ha cancelli o porte

- sorvegliare le quattro porte cittadine e gestire le biglietterie

- aprire e chiudere le case ad accesso limitato per le guide turistiche (questa è l'effettiva principale occupazione dei custodi, visto che ci sono visite guidate tutto il giorno in continuazione)

- aprire e chiudere le case chiuse al pubblico agli archeologi (Pompei è un sito attivo anzi attivissimo, e per fortuna)

Tutto questo con un pubblico di *migliaia* di turisti al giorno (500 sono quelli rimasti fuori nelle prime ore del mattino, ma la maggior parte della gente arriva verso le 11 dopo essere arrivata a napoli e aver preso la circumvesuviana il mattino presto), turisti che sono fra le peggiori teste di cazzo irrispettore della storia dell'archeologia. Salgono sui muri (che sono pericolanti), sulle colonne, si abbracciano alle statue, toccano le pitture, scavalcano i cordoni, si infilano in case chiuse (pericolanti) e ci sono solo i custodi (e qualche archeologo ogni tanto) per dirgli di smettere.

Ora, secondo te bastano 60 custodi? perché ti assicuro che non bastano.

edit: guarda, te la semplifico ancora di più. [Questa](http://www.orangesmile.com/common/img_city_maps/pompei-map-0.jpg) è una mappa ragionevolmente ma non totalmente completa di Pompei. Ci sono listati 69 edifici o monumenti, tutti di grande pregio storico e artistico. Anche solo per poter coprire questi servirebbero 69 custodi invece di 60, visto che si tratta quasi sempre di case o edifici che richiedono ci sia qualcuno *dentro* per poterle sorvegliare.

While the market remains privatized (some players are multinational corporations, others are national corporations with a split private and state ownership), the price setting is becoming more and more of a state monopoly. 

So far they were ""one-off"" events, which happened I think four times total now (not always water, but other utilities and some related lesser services like garbage collection and chimney sweeping). So far during the fully privatized times (up until about 1,5 years ago), price gouging wasn't really a thing, prices were more or less following the inflation adjusted global market rates plus profits. 

People are worried that if we remain in this weird dual system which forces private companies to remain in operation but the prices are set by the state will inevitably mean that they'll cut cost on upkeep and maintenance, which was on their expense so far.

Sono sicuro che lo fai perché ovunque ti giri è un fiorire di battute sui custodi di pompei che lasciano crollare il sito, ma lasciami dire che è veramente una delle cose più stupide e ignoranti che vengono dette sull'argomento.

I custodi non sono restauratori, sono CUSTODI. Sono persone che dovrebbero svolgere la semplice mansione di controllare che le migliaia di turisti che visitano Pompei ogni giorno non danneggino il sito, non entrino nelle aree chiuse al pubblico, non facciano cose pericolose per il pubblico o per i reperti. Una mansione semplice ma fondamentale visto che purtroppo le teste di minchia abbondano (e le ho viste con i miei occhi).

I custodi non sono restauratori: non ci si può improvvisare manutentori di un sito archeologico. Esisteva, decenni fa, un laboratori di restaurazione e manutenzione interno a Pompei, composto di restauratori professionisti che tutti i giorni battevano il sito e notavano gli interventi da fare, per poi pianificarli e realizzarli. Funzionava bene, e i custodi ordinari spesso contribuivano segnalando quello che vedevano.

Peccato che questo laboratorio sia stato smantellato in nome della 'efficienza' che sarebbe risultata dando i lavori di manutenzione in appalto. La ricchezza di competenze e metodi di quel laboratorio è andata distrutta, e ora ogni intervento deve essere appaltato a ditte esterne (immaginati i tempi e le porcherie che ci vanno di mezzo). I custodi possono anche segnalare i problemi che vedono, ma passano anni prima che, forse, venga fatto qualcosa. Per altro i lavori sono tipicamente appaltati ad aziende di edilizia che mancano delle competenze specifiche del vecchio laboratorio.

Ma, uno dice, potrebbero anche rimboccarsi le maniche e fare qualcosa no? interventi di base, sistemazioni minime, cose così? no, a meno di non voler finire nei casini.

Which is why we (EU) need better border controls, and better common policies to deal with the problem, allowing to disperse asylum seekers through member states and integrate them, rather than have huge communities concentrated in one place.

That's non-sense btw, you can't honestly be comparing arbitrary values as signs for economic health and  then complain about quality of data. Both are equally deceptive. You might as well use number of unemployed per square kilometre, which is informative but again deceptive.

We could employ any different arbitrary value, you realize. Why not employ the eurostat ""People at risk of poverty or social exclusion"", which sets France lower than the UK.

France is not doing well, but neither is the UK. France is stagnant and the UK is playing catch-up with itself. My problem is instead of showing general empathy for our shared plight, you jumped on some good ol' French bashing, because a stereotype for xenophobia should be enforced at every opportunity.

There are a lot of different potential structures and there has been a great deal of discussion about them. To massively simplify, one example would be member states continuing to issue debt separately (as now), but each member state being a guarantor of each other member state's debt. An alternative structure might be a new central entity issuing debt, that is funded by each member state. In either case, there is an argument that it amounts to an effective transfer of funds from North to South as it will likely lead to a decrease in borrowing rates by the South and an increase in borrowing rates by the North.

In any case, this all likely requires treaty change and is likely off the table while Angela is around.

Either because the results don't reflect the mind of the whole population, or because a 55% in favour of independence doesn't justify breaking up the country.

I am from Madrid and I would not want Catalonia to break away from Spain. Not because any Spanish nationalistic Catalan-bashing resonates in any way with me; quite the opposite, I feel as much a connection to Catalan culture as to that of parts of Spain, maybe moreso after having lived in Barcelona for a few months and visited often. 

However, the fact that I would _like_ Catalonia to stay does not mean I would try to stop Catalonia from breaking away. I am not deluded enough to believe you can maintain a region in a country against the will of what might be a majority of its people.

That's why (in my fantasies) I would like to see a sane Spanish Government reach an agreement with the Catalan Generalitat (and other regions who might want to break away, why not?) for a *binding* referendum to be carried out with the following rules.

The referendum could be carried out once every 4 years (coinciding with the regional elections, or off by 2 years, whatever is deemed better) until one of the following clear-cut results happen:

+ If &gt;50% of the electoral register (that is **including** people who didn't vote) votes YES to independence, Catalonia is granted independence.

+ If &gt;50% of the electoral register (that is **including** people who didn't vote) votes NO to independence, the referendum may not be held again for a set period of approximately a generation (say, 24 years).


Of course, either result would take a great deal of effort for either the YES or the NO campaign to succeed. That's the point. I wouldn't be enough to just rely on you opponents not caring enough about the issue or choosing to boycott the vote. To win (either _""YES=independence""_ or _""NO=no more referendums for 24 years""_) **the campaigns would need to get people actually caring enough about the issue to go out and vote**. 

Honestly, if you can't even get half of the Catalan electoral register to care enough about independence to actually leave their homes to vote ""YES"" on a Sunday, maybe Catalonia doesn't want independence so badly after all. Conversely, if you can't even get half of the Catalan electoral register to get off their asses to vote ""NO"", maybe nobody cares enough to stop giving independence a chance in another 4 years time.

My personal opinion: Since he is a right-wing, Euro-sceptic politician employed by a pro-Russian organisation, I do not believe a word of what he says. He cannot claim to have an independent status. Since it was a pro-Russian organisation, a lot of the stuff he ""saw"" could have been staged.

He claims that there was no military, no police (apart from the ones at the polling stations), no armed militia. The photos are all fakes, taken in other parts of the Ukraine, but not on the Crimea.

He goes on saying that the militia's presence at the polling stations was necessary due to the high voting turnout. They were there to prevent chaos and to help with the elections. People who voted against the independence from Ukraine were not harassed (the ballot boxes were made of glass, mind you!). 

The population of the Crimea has had a bad attitude towards the Ukraine for ten years, especially due to poor economic development. There were no manipulations. The ballot boxes were made out of glass to prevent fraud. 

He criticised the missing envelopes for the ballot papers. The election helpers were mostly females, not brutes. They told him that envelopes have never been used before at Ukraine elections. He doesn't think that this influenced the outcome.

The polls were conducted in accordance with international law (he cites §2 of the UN charta).

The resistance to the poll comes from warmongers who don't want to see Russia arise.

The Austrian government is a puppet of Merkel, who in turn is a Puppet of the USA.
Merkel &amp; co. are responsible for the coup d'état in the Ukraine or at least didn't prevent it.

Jews are being persecuted by far-right groups in the Ukraine. 

The press tells only lies about the Crimea. 

Austria should take a role as negotiator since it is a neutral state. 

He points out the negative economic consequences of sanctions.

The new government in Kiev needs Russian participation, lest the eastern part will be lost and Ukraine will have to beg alms from the EU. 

Sanctions only worsen the political climate, but do not affect Russians.

97% of chances that it is available if you have a phone line (they might not process your subscription if it is an old cable installation with line noise). In big towns it would be rare not to be able to subscribe.

Speed depends entirely on your distance to the local phone exchange. Max is 20mbps, although in ideal conditions.

Most people in Spain has ADSL at home.

Price span: 23€-50€


**3G/GPRS**

Data plans are usually capped (1GB, 2GB, etc). Probably OK for light Internet browsing. 3G is available in big towns. For rural areas, you might get just GPRS/EDGE.

Hauptbahnhof (Frankfurt Hbf on the map) is the central station, while Taunusanlage is the stop for the banking and financial district. Between the Hauptbahnhof and the financial district is Frankfurt's red light district, although it's a bit run-down these days.

Frankfurt's main shopping district is between Hauptwache and Konstablerwache. Right next to Hauptwache S-Bahn station is the Galeria Kaufhof department store: on the top floor is a self-service restaurant/café with a terrace with a fantastic view of the finance district with its famous skyscrapers.

The historic centre (what's left of it) is at Dom/Römer U-Bahn station.

All these places are well within walking distance of each other, and there are signposts and maps for tourists posted at strategic points. Frankfurt doesn't have much in the way of ""gosh wow, must see"" sights, but it's historically quite important. If you're a history buff, visit St Paul's Church, where the 1848/49 parliament met in Germany's first, and very brief, attempt at democracy. (It failed when the king declined an invitation to become head of state in a constitutional monarchy, suggesting the Germans hadn't at that point quite got the hang of revolutions.)

There are some pleasant walks along the south bank of the river, on the other side from central Frankfurt, and this is where the most famous of Frankfurt's museums are. If it's a fine day, there are a few places you can get a beer and a bite to eat and sit outside.

It's like with China. When you're in Europe China is a great business patner, and fuck the Tibet, North Korea, Taiwan and all the other victims. It's different when you're a neighbor of China.

&gt;

&gt;__Haro Wine Festival__ is a festival in the town of [Haro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haro,_La_Rioja) in the [La Rioja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rioja_(autonomous_community\)) region of northern Spain. It is held every year in the summer and involves wine drinking competitions and contests and a *Batalla de Vino* (Battle of Wine) where wines are poured at each other from buckets.

&gt;The celebration takes place on June 29, the day of the patron saint San Pedro. The day begins at 7:00 am, with a procession of people old and young, dressed in white shirts and red scarves, all carrying jugs, bottles, botas and other types of containers filled with red wine. Led by the town's mayor, on horseback, the procession winds through the town to the Cliffs of Bilibio, where a mass is celebrated at the Hermitage of San Felices de Bilibio. After the mass a true free-for-all begins, with everyone tossing wine on each other until all are soaked from head to foot. There is a sea of wet, pink shirts everywhere. Then at noon everyone returns to town to celebrate at the Plaza de la Paz, followed by bullfights in the town's bullring. But the bullfights are only for the youth, and the ""bulls"" are actually just heifers.

And, as numberless studies have shown, growth based soley on government spending - and therefore debt - is not selfsubstaining and long-lasting, as soon as the spending stops - and at some point it has to stop, because you won't get new money, eurobonds just delay that moment while ruining all of europe in the process - it all goes down again. And after that happens because of the eurobonds, there will be no solvent northern european countries to bail out the rest, because they have just as much debt as everyone else.

With eurobonds, the benefactors themselves want to enact something that will only benefit them, while screwing over the ""creditors"". They are talking about using other people money for their own benefit, while THEY decide the terms. And not the other way - the normal way- where the one doing the lending decides the terms of the credit.

I see you hail from Italy, and i have no idea while southern european countries / citizens have this mythical belief that germany has been using the EU only to further its own interests. That's just wrong and a naive blame game. 

Germany has profited from the EU because it enacted to necessary reforms, that all countries that are now in problems, have refused. It is only logical that now - 15 years later - the measures that have to be taken are more drastic than they were in Germany, since the problems were combated at a much sooner time there.

And regarding the whole currency thing: 
First of all: the common currency was a requirement of france for the reunification of Germany. Germany furthermore sacrificed the Bundesbank - that was already by far the most influential national bank on the continent and whose monetary policies influenced those of the other countries enormously - in order to comply to that requirement, even though by doing this it gave up the possibility of influencing the monetary policies of the whole continent for it's benefit, seeing as the old bundesbank actually only worked for germanys benefit, while the EZB does clearly not.

Germany is one of the most pro-european and pro-integration countries within the EU, but if this stupid blame game does not stop, i would no be surprised to see a rapid change is this behaviour.",0,1403542617,null,0,1403542850,0,ciey9dm,t3_28v4rk,t1_ciey9dm,t1_ciexe6w,null,1434366938,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

PM me if you would like me to do that.

There is also an option for 5GB a month / 500 MB day (whichever comes first) for 15€/month. (http://www.lidl.de/de/daten-optionen/s3605) You can switch between those plans every month.

Lots of people love Milka or Ritter Sport chocolate (I prefer the latter because Milka is very sweet), if you want something more expensive I'd go with Lindt. My favorite is an Austrian brand called Zotter, but they have some unusual flavors and are mostly available in health food stores, you won't find them in a supermarket. 

Concerning desserts: the easiest is Schokoladenpudding, you can make one yourself. Half a litre of milk,  40g starch, 1-2 tablespoons sugar and chocolate with 70% cocoa (anything between 20 and 50 g depending on how much chocolate you like) .  Just chop the chocolate, heat the milk (save approx. 3 tablespoons), put the chocolate in the milk and stir while it dissolves. Combine starch and sugar, stir with the remaining milk until there are no clumps left,  then pour the starch mixture into the warm not yet boiling chocolate milk. Stir very thoroughly until it starts to boil and little bubbles appear on the top. Finished. :) now just pour it in small bowls. Or if you want it extra decadent, wait until it's cool, whip up some whipped cream and stir it in. Yum. If you're lazy, just buy a pack of Dr. Oetker pudding, but it's not much less work and doesn't taste as good.

1. Technically speaking no-one voted for Junker anywhere. This is fine. Technically speaking no-one voted for Merkel or Cameron anywhere either (except perhaps a tiny number of people within their specific disctricts, assuming they ran as MPs which I don't really know for sure). People in the UK could vote for Junker, or for anyone else, and did. The 4 Freedoms Party was the EPP choice. Brits didn't vote for it much, but that's life. Some districts didn't vote for tories much either.

2. The British people elected Cameron in the same sense the European people elected Junker: their parliamentary fraction was the biggest. Note in neither case did they actually get a majority, or actually a direct election. The distinction is one of scope: obviously Junker can't overrule Cameron in the British Cabinet or Westminster, and Cameron has no role to play in the Commission or the European Parliament.

Last, every time you get a level of indirection, you lose democratic representation. This is shown by the Penrose-Banzhaf power index. If you have a Parliament, that chooses a PM, that joins a Council, that chooses the Commission, you lose more representation than if you have a Parliament that chooses a Commission. ON democratic representation alone, it's clear what is the most respectful to the electorate.

true,rakony,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Your second point is a very interesting one but I'm going to take issue with your first statement. In Germany voter turn out for the last national election was 71.55% for the European election it was 47.9%, in France there was 80% participation in the last presidential election and 43.5% for the last European election,  in the UK turnout for the last national election was 65.77% for the EU election it was 36%, in Spain we see a 68.4% turnout for national elections and 45.9% turnout for European elections. While I can't be bothered to go through all the stats I've yet to find a single national election with voter participation under 50%. Meanwhile the only big country with an over 50% EU parliament turnout was Italy. Admittedly stats get better in smaller countries such as Denmark, Luxembourg and Belgium however we still see that overall the EU parliament does not attract the same level of participation as national ones.

On your second point as I said that's an interesting angle to consider, and to an extent a valid one. However I'd say a similar issue exists with the EU parliament albeit manifested in a different way. A disconnect exists between why the voters vote and what they end up voting for. Take for example the Labour party 25.4% of the vote. The Labour party belongs to the S&amp;D grouping in the European Parliament. However the voters are most certainly not voting for an S&amp;D programme. The S&amp;D is very federalist something anathema to the British public. So clearly the populace is voting on national issues, thus a disconnect still exists albeit in a different form. Ultimately however the different emphasis of importance you and I place on this issue is down to our different visions of the EU.

2. I am from developing country and currently working one of the Ministry in my country so I am at the target group. But still, how competitive is the scholarship?

You were they one saying they can't vote. Therefore my reply.

Yeah... not immediately. As if that mattered. We're talking about cultural and societal changes. Some effects you feel in a couple of years. Some in ten. Some in a few decades.

Depends what you define by *normal*. Right now it's normal to have a high percentage of Muslim population, in Malmo they make up 20%. And there's of course Muslim areas of the city and locals schools where that percentage  is higher.

The one about the inflected verb in the second position is tricky, because almost anything can go in the first position -- but the verb stays where it is:

Ich habe Brot --&gt; Vielleicht habe ich Brot

However, some types of word take the zeroth position:

Ich habe Brote --&gt; Denn ich habe Brot (because ""denn"" is in the zeroth position, ""ich"" in the first position, and ""habe"" in the second.

Now we are allowed because Catalan government paid for the restauration of the monastery.

The only way to get a correct answer on the internet is to state a wrong one, not by asking a question. Thanks, now /u/Merkels_muschi and I are informed. 

&gt; Catalonia of course existed in times of the Eastern Roman Empire. What were YOU told on school????

Most of what is now Catalonia first became part of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior; after 27 BC, they became part of Tarraconensis, whose capital was Tarraco (now Tarragona). The arrival of Roman administrative and institutional structures led to the development of a network of cities and roads, the adoption of agriculture based on cereals, grapes, and olives, the introduction of irrigation, the development of Roman law, and the adoption of the Latin language.

true,Jaquestrap,UNSA,United States of America,"Nobody is or will be talking about this in the U.S. This is really not a big deal and you would be surprised how little the American public cares about U.S.-Polish relations. It's actually what lies at the core behind Sikorski's statements. U.S. Foreign Policy leaders understand the value and importance behind the alliance but many U.S. politicians (Obama being a great example) are still beholden to their constituents, and also simply are not foreign policy experts, and thus do not put real value behind the relationship. It's the reason why the military shield was dropped; the U.S. only secures Polish interests when those interests directly line up to its own interests, otherwise Poland is seen by many (uninformed) Americans and politicians as an unimportant ally who's interests we can and will sacrifice to further our own. Despite Poland being a steadfast ally and very valuable asset to U.S. Foreign policy, the relationship simply doesn't have the same level of importance to most Americans and U.S. policy makers as Western European Alliances and even many Asian ones. Make no mistake unless something were to change, if it came to a hypothetical situation between choosing to support Poland and seriously confronting a belligerent Russia, or allowing important Polish interests to be sacrificed and ""warming"" relations with Russia (like Obama tried to do by pulling out the missile shield) then the latter would undoubtedly be chosen--unless standing up to Russia happened to coincide with U.S. interests. Bush had a point, Americans are quick to forget about Poland. It's an embarrassment for the United States' reputation and foreign policy.

However the same way that the U.S. wouldn't jeopardize its interests by giving a lot of *support* to Poland in a serious crisis, it also wouldn't jeopardize its interests by making a big deal out of something like this. Foreign policy makers know that there is a lot to gain from continued U.S.-Polish relations when the two continue to have similar goals and interests. And part of it simply comes down to not caring--if U.S. politicians don't *really* care about Poland (on the same level they care about countries like England, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, or even ""less-important"" nations like Egypt, Italy, India, and even trading partners like China), then why the hell would they care about what the Poles really think of them? It hasn't slowed down U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia or Pakistan. Respect is only *really* demanded when it's being given and not reciprocated.

IMO unless something significant happens to turn U.S.-Polish relations away from being so lopsided and cause genuine efforts from the U.S. to be a steadfast ally to Poland, then Poland would be far better off affiliating itself with the EU. America would start a World War for England, France, Germany, Japan, or Korea--the only way it would do so for Poland was if NATO risked falling apart as a result. On the other-hand, a strong and united Europe *would* actually stand beside Poland, for a number of reasons.

Poland does more for the U.S. than it gets in return, all that Poland really gets are promises--oftentimes empty ones at that. For example, even after Poland's **very** significant contributions to Afghanistan and Iraq, they were awarded none of the valuable reconstruction contracts they asked for, instead those contracts went to countries that either didn't contribute or contributed far less, such as Chinese and French companies. And everyone knows how America reneged on its missile shield plan, just to get some half-hearted statements of support from Russia for sanctions on Iran.",0,1403548969,null,0,1403550103,0,cif1n4b,t3_28s9dj,t1_cif1n4b,t1_ciexg5y,null,1434368601,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Nonetheless, if we are to correct this problem (and I can see how someone who's not interested in having meaningful European integration which definitely requires meaningful democracy might not want to do this) we have to start from the fact the Europarl elections are often presented, and even more often perceived, as useless, and the Europarl as powerless. How do we do this? An obvious way is making them matter, by making Europarl matter and linking the appointment of the EC to them. This, which was (with more or less quibbles, as you wish) passed by Lisbon, is what seems to be happening now, and I don't see why it gets people raging.

Regarding your last point on people voting on national issues, in the end we can't be the people's nursemaid. If parties are integrated into parliamentary groups that don't suit them, they have perfect autonomy to change this accordingly. If people aren't paying attention at the S&amp;D or ALDE programme, there's not much we can do about that.

European military is defensive, it needs hardly any logistics to function properly, it is cheap and practical, although Europe is still divided on the united military effort concept and not any kind larger cooperation exists at present, the very moment US. bases are removed this would become the first action to happen, cooperation would be forced.

You should read the talk [Habermas gave about self-interest in the long term.](http://www.kuleuven.be/communicatie/evenementen/evenementen/jurgen-habermas/en/democracy-solidarity-and-the-european-crisis) 

It is obviously in the interest of the ""poor countries"" to get help from the ""rich countries"". But in the long-term, it is also in the interest of the ""rich countries"" to help the ""poor countries"", both because they can expect reciprocity when they get in trouble but also because the system becomes more balanced. 

In the words of the famous MacDougall report:

&gt; The need for redistribution between member states arises partly because the process of economic integration, which may confer net gains in the aggregate, does not necessarily raise the economic welfare in all areas. The changing pattern of production and exchange that characterizes an integrating Community typically brings gains to some but loses to others. **To make integration acceptable to all participants may thus require an explicit redistributive mechanism to divide the gains from integration in a politically acceptable way.**

&gt; Failure to attend to this matter may at the least result in stagnation of the integration process, and at the worst result in secession and dissolution.

(emphasis mine)

I think it's obvious that if the arrangement is beneficial to everyone in the aggregate but confers gains to some individual regions and losses to other individual regions, then it's the latter, the ones that have losses that will protest and try to change the arrangement, not the former. The former are quite comfortable with the status quo. ",0,1403550581,null,0,false,0,cif2h9j,t3_28v4rk,t1_cif2h9j,t1_ciet0m7,null,1434368995,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I understand. Just thought of adding that side note, since even they are less relevant they can still have a strong effect in how community is organised.

I never said there was a problem with *the law*. Simply pointing out many will likely vote indeed, as reply to the affirmation that they won't. 

&gt; You really think a large disenfranchised population would be better for Sweden?

Not necessarily. But again it's not the law I'm criticising. All of these refugees voting will be a problem. To say that all of them not voting would  be even worse is not very relevant.

Yes. I've spent a fair time in Malmo and Stockholm. I also have friends from there, and family who lived in Sweden for quite a few years.

&gt; As for the rape, that's because Sweden deosn't underreport their rape.

That is true, the high numbers can at least partially be explained by that. But the rate of the (overall) increase is less likely.

true,dngrs,WALL,Wallachia,"In the Romanian folk poem Miorita, a shepherd boy is warned by his beloved ewe, Miorita, that his fellow shepherds plan to murder him and take his flock. Instead of resisting, he accepts his fate, asking only that Miorita go in search of his mother and tell her the story not of how he was betrayed, but of how he was married to the daughter of a powerful King. Thereafter, wherever the ewe wanders, she tells the story--not the true, unadorned facts of death and betrayal, but a beautiful fiction of a transcendent wedding.

This simple story, told and retold in countless versions, is Romania's most enduring cultural text.(1) The popularity of the Miorita can be attributed to the power and simplicity of its poetry, but even more to its mythic structure. The myth has been used to define the Romanian character by several authors, including Mircea Eliade, who has called the ""cosmic marriage"" of the Miorita an example of ""cosmic Christianity""--part pagan, part Christian, but in any case wholly Romanian--""dominated by a nostalgia for nature sanctified by the presence of Jesus.""(2) But the most controversial concept of Romanian identity to be derived from the poem is the concept of ""mioritic space"" defined by the Transylvanian poet and philosopher Lucian Blaga.

For Blaga, the path of Miorita's wandering delineates what he calls ""mioritic space,"" a geography of the Romanian poetic imagination, or, as one recent historian of the Romanians describes it, ""a philosophical attempt to explain the Romanian spirit through the Romanian landscape, which [Blaga] saw as the stylistic matrix of Romanian culture"" (Georgescu 205). Blaga's critics have charged that this concept has become a liability, nationalistic, escapist and fatalistic. For political analysts, Blaga has been criticized as a romantic aesthete, self-absorbed and disengaged from political realities, while pursuing a mystical communion with nature.(3) In this view, mioritic space is an escapist dream of a romantic nationalist that encourages political apathy. For ethnographers, it is a romantic distortion of the Romanian peasantry's connection to the land that ignores political and historical reality. These critics suggest that it may even account for the tendency of the Romanian people to suffer oppression passively: ""one 'cause' of the seeming passivity of the Romanian population may be the fatalistic Weltanschaaung implicit in the Miorita"" (Kligman 356). But to Blaga, mioritic space was simply a way of locating the Romanian poetic spirit.

All these theories and criticisms may seem like much ado about a boy and his sheep, but the story has great resonance to a country long troubled by internal conflicts and external conquerors. It has often been noted that Romania is, geographically, ""inside-out,"" its mountains in the interior, its plains on the borders, leaving it vulnerable to invasion. More than once has the Romanian spirit had to take refuge from the threats presented to its exposed borders by escaping to the mountains and forests of its interior. When the threat was institutionalized within its own borders during the Turkish and Communist regimes, the Romanian spirit could survive only by going into physical (usually political) or metaphysical exile.

Long answer: It's complicated. This land was not meant to be a separate country, these people were not given a chance to learn or develop for centuries, these problems were not created in 1991, they were there a very long time.

Yes, there were no wars in Moldova (except the 1992 war), but we were constantly assaulted in other ways, mainly political and economical warfare.

The population is...not especially intellectual. Systematic deportation and extermination of the intellectual elite in Moldova and in the same time the export or Russia's undesirables here have left Moldova's gene pool quite ... limited. It was a concentrated effort and the result is tragic. 

The main solution I see here is a massive educational boost to the younger, more capable generation. Unfortunately, it's a vicious circle. We need money to invest in education, but we have no money because we lack education, academic and non-academic.

Please don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say we're all stupid here and aren't capable of forming complete sentences (although some can't indeed), I'm just pointing out that we're perhaps not as intellectually gifted as we could have been.

It was part of Giuliani's broken windows plan. So like these cops will ride around and do vice stuff mostly, you know, arresting prostitutes, graffiti artists, breaking up fights and muggings. I don't know if they are referred to as QOL officially but that's what they are. Basically cops to enforce the mostly petty stuff. The concept is that if you enforce the petty stuff (graffiti, muggings, prostitution, vagrancy, public drunkenness etc.) you give the populace the impression that all crime is enforced, and so reduce the likelihood of serious crime occuring (your GBH, (edit: violent) muggings, sexual assaults, and murders, or what have you).

So in New York they say it works, but New York is pretty in line with the rest of the U.S. in the decline in crime that it has experienced. Whether QOL policing actually makes an impact is up for debate.

Now, so you know my biases, and since I am not a police officer, I take most of this knowledge from following the news when Giuliani was mayor and reading books that involve the subject (including Richard Price's novel *Lush Life*, which goes into detail about Price's experiences doing ride-alongs with QOL Units). Price was a writer for the HBO show *the Wire*, so take that for what you will.

However the way Fidesz handled the negotiations was to not do a tender at all (where other parties like the French or the South Koreans could've submitted their offers), instead held secret talks with the Russian nuclear agency, Rosatom. Experts say they are the world's best in their field, but the exclusivity and the secrecy really irated people. 

The government didn't even consult with the other parties in the National Assembly or announce that talks are ongoing except for the very last part when the deal was announced within 1-2 weeks. The way they handled this business is a perfect example of how Orbán thinks he can do anything and get away with it because of the supermajority. A lot of critic went toward the finance side of the deal, where we'll be paying back the Russians for three decades and naturally a large share of the subcontractors must be Russian as well as per the terms of the contract.

true,Jaquestrap,UNSA,United States of America,"Why does Russia take a hard-line absolute Realist international approach, looking out for Russian interests, and then bitch and throw the blame on nations like Poland for heated relations when nations like Poland aren't the ones destabilizing, invading, and annexing their neighbors, using natural gas embargoes like a choke-collar to control other countries, drastically increasing military spending, and operating under the assumption that they has a ""sphere of influence"" that encompasses other democratic states and allows them to determine not only their international politics but also their domestic ones? Poland doesn't escalate *anything* when it acts like any rational nation would under those circumstances--it is being an objectively smart nation and understanding the inherent dangers posed to it by the giant, selfish, self-obsessed bully next door. So it goes ahead and recognizes the threat, becomes friends with the big, oftentimes selfish, loudmouthed, brash, but typically well-meaning guy with a ton of guns and a vigilante-justice complex down at the end of the street, and buys a gun for itself. Then when it sees the bully next door trying to intimidate everyone around it and break into other people's houses, it calls the bully out for being a dick. The bully sees that Poland is standing up for itself, and then has the self-centered, narcissistic audacity to feel *wronged* that Poland went and got itself a friend and is calling the bully out on its bullshit, and starts shouting at Poland not to ""escalate the situation!""

That's total bullshit. It isn't Poland that escalates the situation--the situation is already *constantly* escalated by Russia's actions, the only reason actual friction and conflict rears its head is because nations simply refuse to stand for it. It'd be like the U.S. telling Central American countries not to ""escalate"" things during the 80s when the U.S. was running around manipulating the shit out of them. 9 times out of 10 since the end of WWII, when Russia has come into conflict or heightened tensions with its neighbors it's been Russia's fault--only a completely narcissistic country that felt entitled to do whatever it wanted to its neighbors would actually blame conflict and war on those neighbors being worried about conflict and war and exercising their right to secure their interests and defend themselves. 

&gt; Do you really believe that you could ""teach"" Russia with sanctions and NATO military near borders?

You complain about NATO military near borders--there are barely a few hundred U.S. soldiers stationed in Eastern Europe, and the militaries of the Baltic States are pathetically small compared to Russia's. On the other hand, there are *tens of thousands* of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, who is really trying to ""teach"" who a lesson here? The Western troops are there simply to reassure their Eastern Allies--the only reason Russia thinks they are there to ""teach"" anyone is because that is exactly the kind of thing that Russia does.

&gt; Your fears about ""invasion"", i can't imagine what makes you think so.

How about the hundreds of years of occupation of Poland by Russia? How about the 3+ invasions of Poland from Russia in the past century? How about the intense level of oppression against Poles by Russians during each and every Occupation; the overwhelming effort put forth by successive Russian and Soviet governments to break Polish identity, nationality, political identity, national identity, religion, and even language and culture; the *millions* of Poles brutally murdered, deported, exiled, starved, imprisoned, and oppressed with each Russian invasion over the past 300 years, **making even the slightest prospect of another Russian invasion an intolerable one no matter how small the chance?**

Now how about Poland looking at a resurgent Russia involving itself in conflicts in neighboring states like Georgia and Ukraine, and having plenty of historical precedents to show that when Russia starts throwing its weight around outside its borders **it has never just stopped right before Poland and said ""yeah okay we're done now, you do your thing Poland!""**

&gt; Do we have disputed territories with Poland?

Historically speaking, yes. Russia already gobbled up the Eastern half of Poland in WWII. But Russia wouldn't need to have disputed territories with Poland in order to try to dominate it--all it would need to do is expand it's borders and/or ""sphere of influence"" to Polish borders before it became ""intolerable to Russian interests and security!"" for it to have a neighboring Poland that wasn't under Russian domination and thus potentially serve as a ""launching point"" for attack by Russia's enemies. Of course in that case in classic Russian order, it would be stated as though it were a universal truth that Russian ""interests/security"" surely trumped the right of a smaller nation (Russian propaganda constantly tries to discredit the veracity and reputation of Poland as a functioning independent nation with valid interests and rights to sovereignty anyways as it has been for centuries) for sovereignty and independence. Besides, wouldn't it be much better for all those Poles anyway if they just fell under the protection of their ""big Slavic brother"" and joined the great Russian sphere anyways?

&gt; The worst and most unfriendly acts from Russia from past time is periodical bans of meat and milk export from Poland.

Oh yeah, those are definitely worse acts than the massive military exercises Russia carried out simulating an invasion of Poland and its Baltic allies just a couple years ago. Or how about blackmailing with natural-gas exports? Or all the anti-Polish political rhetoric, the multitude of Russian football fans unfurling massive ""This is Russia"" banners at the Eurocup, and the constant veiled threats and political bullying from Russian leadership to Poland?

&gt; I remember last few years of USSR believe me it sucked to.

That's absolutely no argument to the point that Russia *imposed that occupation onto the Poles.* It wasn't some kind of equal-share ""we were all in the same boat"" scenario--the USSR was completely dominated by Russia and the shitty living situation in Russia at the time was entirely a product of, you guessed it, *Russia!*

On the contrary, Poland was entirely subjugated by a foreign power and forced to be a part of a system it had absolutely no interest in being a part of. 

I also remember living behind the Iron Curtain, in both Warsaw *and* Moscow. I'm half Russian and half Polish, and trust me while I love my Russian culture, Russian heritage, Russian history (barring parts), Russian language, Russian people, and believe it or not even Russian pride, this does not mean that I have to love the Russian government and what the Russian state has done and continues to do. If only Russia could turn all of that power, potential, drive, and pride *internally* like the rest of Europe has, and America did for so long, then it would be so much better off and would cause so much less suffering for itself and its neighbors. But for some reason Russians have always been people who are okay with being treated like shit and living worse as long as their government can tell them ""it's okay, you belong to the strongest nation in the world!""

So Moldova was left with no economy, a population with no real skills in anything other than agriculture (which can't bring much money anyways), plus the people honestly were too poor to start any business of their own so they just keep living hand to mouth off whatever job they could get. 
Also you have to realize that the Soviet Union was just a horribly depressing place which left you aware by the time you turned 6 that you had no future and the situation will never improve, and after some 70 or so years of USSR domination this became embedded into the Moldovan mentality, alot of Moldovans still do believe that there situation will never improve and they give up hope and never try.  
  
About the identity crisis I can't speak for Moldovans, but as a Polish person its easy to understand that the more horrible shit your people have been through the more pride and love for your country you have. Moldovans are generally Romanians but because they have suffered more then the Romanians I assume that they feel that they have their own identity; that might be hard to understand if you come from a western country but you can't understand it until you experience it for yourself.

Before conviction he was avoiding arrest. He left the country and went to Germany, Then Sweden and ...Russia.

You might want to tell them that they are missing over 40, 000 homeless people.

&gt;Them more the better, and as well as that there are thousands of unused houses here that could be easily turned into social housing.

By plenty of houses you mean ghost estates in the middle of nowhere, with no schools, no public transport networks or amenities? That would just ghettoize newcomers from the get go. Not a good idea.

&gt;and yes, they should be provided with welfare, they are humans so they deserve the basic human rights, I know you are japanese and over there there is more of racist tendencies, but I like to be open minded and not judge every person by race or nationality.

So anyone who wants to come to Ireland should be allowed to an immediately given welfare, social housing and free education. Who is going to fund all this?

true,shackleton1,EURO,European Union,"No, I don't think you've quite understood. I understand indirection, you correctly identify that we have it here in the UK. But what has happened with the EU election is more than this.

People *did* elect Cameron; i.e. they understood that the  election of candidates they were presented with would result in Cameron, Brown, Clegg etc becoming Prime Minister. They were well informed as to who these people were and what their policies were. They made their choice with a reasonable degree of understanding. The issue of a hung parliament adds an additional trickiness to the scenario, but that's a bit of an aside - a hung parliament was not the problem with the European election. 

At the European election, very few people knew who the candidates were or how they were chosen (which is itself quite complex, the candidate is confirmed by the EU parliament but technically chosen by the national heads of state, as I understand it?). In the UK, it was not possible to vote for Junker - no candidates for election were members of Junker's party. Nor did they understand the consequences of their vote (and indeed this might be because this is a system in its infancy). In fact, most people voted in the EU elections as a way of influencing the national governments. Nobody knew who Junker was, or any of the other candidates for that matter, what their policies were etc. So no, the election of Junker and the election of Cameron are not the same. They are quite different.

Now, personally I don't see that there is any choice but to choose Junker, but I can understand why people object to it, and personally I feel that this situation should not arise again. There are many things that the national government in the UK can do to help prevent this situation in the future. There are also many things that the EU government can do to help prevent this situation in future. In an ordinary election, I would expect to have seen Junker candidates in the UK, regardless of whether any national parties supported him or not. Why did the EPP not run candidates in Britain? It's a party that represents all of Europe, right? What was stopping them from putting candidates forward? The answer is that the system isn't up to scratch yet, it's still new, it has a lot of quirks to iron out - one of them being that these parties are not truly European parties yet; they are still conglomerations of national parties. Anyway, I digress. I would have expected to see literature about the election, adverts, media coverage. Did the EPP deliver a manifesto? Did it air party political broadcasts? This was not really a proper election, not in the UK, and falls far short of what we consider to be a basic level of legitimacy. Now, I can't say for sure, but as I understand it this election is almost by accident; i.e. the media in some parts of Europe has presented it as an election for president, whereas in others (namely the UK, but I expect other places too), it is not. After all, that's not what it says in the Lisbon treaty, is it?

As I say, there is no choice except for Junker, but it's quite understandable that people object.

During the time they work here they earn 5000 - 10000 € per month for their smugglers. (without ever seeing any profits for themselves). 

Some manage to stay here and of those some repeat the circle by going back to their homelands and ""hiring"" new talent for the prostitution rings.

&gt;And yet Sanandaji now argues that Sweden should stop taking in people who share his background. “Immigration has meant that Sweden has imported a bunch of social and economic problems that to a degree didn’t exist before,” he tells me, sitting in a modern conference room at his office in the upscale Östermalm neighborhood of Stockholm. “For a number of reasons -- a long period of peace, a homogenous population -- Sweden has had a unique combination of welfare, growth, and equality. That idyll is to a certain degree over.”

As a specific example, progressives, demotists, liberals and the rest like to draw out scientific development, as if it weren't almost entirely orthagonal and independent of political development for the most part. But, it's actually a useful example in this case - let's just take the case of the decidedly traditionalist and anti-democratic Austro-Hungarian and German empires. For the time of their existence, they collected the majority of Nobel prizes in scientific categories, more than all the demotist world powers at the time.

It's true, there is very little concrete observational data that would lead to unambiguous conclusions - namely, the possibility of a direct comparison between a demotist and traditionalist country of similar size, culture and economic power, existing in the same age. Which is why much of neo-reactionary historical analysis fails to offer a proper analogy to modernity, instead focusing on ways in which modern interpretation of classical political systems is skewed, biased and wrong. I suppose France in the 19th century is a good example of demotism failing, or not suceeding as much as some of its traditionalist neighbours

Preceding and following the EU ascensions the western products hit the Romanian market like a hammer. Numbers say we can feed close to 60 milion people. We're 20. At present we're importing vast percentages (50% not sure, must check) of our food. It is somewhat improving as the subsidies will finally kick in. 

As a consequence to this fall in agriculture and opened borders we had a massive wave of migration of people previously engaged in it. And as we found out, Western Europe frowns much more to this kind of people than many other immigrants categories.

Related to that, I would say Frankfurt's clubs are a tiny bit better than those in Stuttgart, they have/had some famous electronic music clubs. Might also get the better DJ's / music acts, but not by far. 

Frankfurt has more low-income families, immigrants, lots of bankers and crime. I don't like the clubs, lots of weird guidos.

true,ulyssanov,null,null,"Ich habe vor 2 Monaten auch sowas bekommen und mich danach ausgiebig informiert.

Die meisten der ""Kanzleien"" die sowas verschicken sind eigentlich keine Kanzleien sondern wahre Abmah-Maschinen die sich darauf spezialisiert haben, die Gesetzeslage auszunutzen um Leute wie dich einzuschüchtern und ihnen das Geld aus der Tasche zu ziehen. Das traurige ist, dass das leider legal ist, Anspruch auf Schadensersatz und Unterlassung haben sie tatsächlich.

Diese Abmahnschreiben sind zu 100% automatisiert und wenn du so etwas bekommst ist es wahrscheinlich, dass sich nicht ein mal ein Mensch mit deinem Fall befasst hat. Diese ""Anwälte"" beauftragen Drittfirmen die mit ominösen Mitteln die keiner so richtig kennt Millionen von IP Addressen von Filesharern abgreifen und verschicken dann automatisch diese Abmahnschreiben. Von einer der größten Abmahnkanzleien (Waldorf&amp;Frommer) wird angenommen dass die in guten Monaten mehrere hunderttausend Abmahnung rausgeschickt haben. Man spricht nicht umsonst von einer Abmahnindustrie. Die ganze Taktik ist abartig und hat nichts mehr mit einem normalen rechtsstaatlichen Verfahren zu tun, es ist pure, industrialisierte Abzocke mit der sich Anwälte und Kunden die Taschen füllen indem völlig aus der Luft gegriffene Schadensersatzansprüche geltend gemacht werden. Das ganze ist natürlich auf maximale Einschüchterung optimiert, so dass die meisten sofort beim Erhalt eines Briefes Panik kriegen und den Betrag überweisen. 

Nun aber mal zu den wichtigen Fakten:

-Der Mandant (die Filmgesellschaft) hat Anspruch auf Unterlassung und Schadensersatz. Wie hoch dieser an sich sein sollte müsste ein Gericht entscheiden - Die Kanzlei bietet dir an, das zu umgehen indem du eine Pauschalsumme bezahlst und die Sache damit aus der Welt schaffst

-Dein Vorteil liegt darin, dass es, trotz aller Drohungen und Angstmache, nicht im Interesse der Kanzlei liegt dich vor Gericht zu zerren. Die wollen schnelle, einfache Kohle machen, eine Gerichtsverhandlung bedeutet für die einen Haufen Arbeit und Zeitverlust. Das heisst nicht dass es ausgeschlossen ist, dass sie es darauf ankommen lassen, es ist aber unwahrscheinlich.

-Allein aufgrund der schieren Anzahl an Abmahnungen ist es für die Kanzleien sowie für die Gerichte faktisch unmöglich jeden der so einen Brief ignoriert vor Gericht zu zerren, die hätten dann nichts anderes mehr zu tun und die Gerichte wären überflutet mit Abmahnprozessen. Man muss dazu sagen dass aber durchaus auch immer mal wieder welche verklagt werden, um ein exempel an denen zu statuieren - man hat ja einen Ruf zu wahren.

-Es liegt nun an dir ob du es darauf ankommen lassen willst, dass der Schadensersazanspruch nach drei Jahren verjährt (so sieht momentan die Gesetzgebung aus) und du bis dahin nicht verklagt wirst, oder ob du die Summe zahlst um die Sache aus der Welt zu schaffen. Keiner kann dir genau sagen wie die Chancen stehen, in einschlägigen Foren wird da sehr viel drüber spekuliert aber es weiß einfach keiner genau, wieviele tatsächlich vor Gericht gezerrt werden. Dass es im Falle einer Verhandlung wesentlich teurer wird muss man wohl nicht erwähnen.

-Zum Schluss noch ganz wichtig: Auch wenn du dich entscheidest nicht zu zahlen und es drauf ankommen zu lassen, solltest du auf jeden Fall die Unterlassungserklärung, zu der du höchstwahrscheinlich schon einen Vordruck erhalten hast, ausfüllen und zuschicken. Du versicherst damit, dass du den Film nicht weiter verbreiten wirst und erfüllst somit zumindest einen Teil der Forderungen ohne dass das für dich größere Nachteile hat. Wenn du das nicht machst, ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit relativ hoch dass die Kanzlei vor Gericht geht. 

ABER GANZ WICHTIG: Unterschreibe nicht den Wisch, den die dir geschickt haben. Der Vordruck von den Kanzleien ist so formuliert dass er für dich unnötige Einschränkungen beinhaltet und vor Gericht ggf. als Schuldeingeständnis interpretiert werden kann. Es gibt im Internet vorformulierte Unterlassungserklärungen die sich darauf Beschränken, dass du versicherst, den Film nicht zu verteilen, nichts mehr und nicht weniger. Auf nichts anderes hat der Mandant einen Anspruch, darum solltest du denen auch nichts anderes geben.

-Eine letzte Sache noch: Wie schon erwähnt gibt es mittlerweile als weiteren, perversen Auswuchs der Abmahnindustrie auch Anwälte, die sich wiederrum auf die ""Abwehr"" solcher Schreiben spezialisiert haben und damit überall im Internet werben. Die machen nichts anderes, als sich ebenfalls eine goldene Nase an dieser Scheiße zu verdienen. Die versuchen dann, die Schadensersatzsumme herunterzuhandeln und ""beraten"" dich (sagen dir ungefähr das, was ich dir gerade gesagt habe). Das funktioniert sogar meistens und ist auch schön und gut - nur dass du die am Ende auch bezahlen musst. In den meisten Fällen kommst du unterm Strich bei Null raus oder zahlst sogar mehr. Du zahlst dann statt 735€ vielleicht nur 500€ an die Kanzlei, musst aber noch 300 für deinen Anwalt abdrücken. Ich rate davon ab, schon allein aus dem Grund, dass diese Anwälte genau solche Aßgeier sind, wie die ursprünglichen Abmahner und man dieses perverse, auf Betrug basierende Ökosystem nicht noch unterstützen sollte. Ich persönlich habe die Unterlassungserklärung damals abgesendet und alles weitere ignoriert. Bisher habe ich zwei Mahnungen kassiert und werde nun warten wie es weitergeht.

Übrigens: Sollte tatsächlich eines Tages ein Klagebescheid ins Haus flattern, kannst du dich fast immer auch dann noch mit der Abmahnkanzlei einigen und die Vertragsstrafe bezahlen und das Thema ist gegessen. Eventuell gibt es noch Mahngebühren, die Summe steigt aber nicht ins astronomische - wie schon gesagt, die haben absolute keine Lust auf einen Prozess, auch wenn sie sehr gerne damit drohen.",0,1403566793,null,0,false,0,cifalj4,t3_28wnxl,t1_cifalj4,t3_28wnxl,null,1434372888,27,false,de,t5_22i0,27

Our borders are completely open to genuine refugees. These people are illegals and some will claim asylum. Until they are awarded asylum, they are not legally considered refugees. If they get refugee status, they will not be sent back. And I'm fine with that. The rest though, those that are refused asylum, they should go.

That you need to put a huge investment in these people for very little return. The poster is from a country that is borrowing billions ofmeuro at high interest just to keep the show on the road. A country cutting essential services to the bone. Yet, he wants to give welfare, free education and housing to anyone who shows up there.

Anyway, he was Irish. You are Swedish. Lets take a look at Sweden.

An Iraqi born economist in Sweden beliefs that unskilled immigration into Sweden will destroy the Swedish welfare state.

&gt;Tino Sanandaji is among the last people one would expect to argue that immigrants pose a threat to Sweden’s way of life. An economist at Stockholm’s renowned free-market think tank Research Institute of Industrial Economics, Sanandaji is a member of a Swedish elite that has long defended open borders. 

&gt;And yet Sanandaji now argues that Sweden should stop taking in people who share his background. “Immigration has meant that Sweden has imported a bunch of social and economic problems that to a degree didn’t exist before,” he tells me, sitting in a modern conference room at his office in the upscale Östermalm neighborhood of Stockholm. “For a number of reasons -- a long period of peace, a homogenous population -- Sweden has had a unique combination of welfare, growth, and equality. That idyll is to a certain degree over.”

Unskilled immigration or unskilled labour is not the thing that is destroying the Swedish welfare state. The main problem in Sweden right now is *over-education*, meaning that too much time and money is spent on educating people for things that they don't need an education to do. This is an accepted truth on all sides of the political debate, yet there is no simple political solution to it, because having that education is what decides who gets the good job. But in reality, it's a huge drain on time, money, and early-life energy.

&gt; That you need to put a huge investment in these people for very little return.

This is your problem right here. The investment is in fact not anything close to ""huge"" by any stretch. The return you get from these illegal immigrants is usually insanely good. From a business standpoint it's the dream. From a social and moral standpoint it's crap but *don't* use the money argument if you don't know how it works.

&gt; Genuine refugees are turned away from the EU? Please provide sources.

I don't even know if I should dignify this with an answer. Sweden sends back homosexuals to Iran with the claim that they don't have to be ""openly gay"" and therefore don't have to risk their lives.

Sweden regularly send people ""back"", that speak Swedish perfectly and Swedish only (and English plus whatever extra they learned in school). People that have no family or connection to the place where they are being sent whatsoever. People that we've already actually invested money in and that are or are about to become tax-payers, but that we refuse to take the returns from.

But most of all, anyone seeking asylum must get to the country where they seek asylum. The people that you call ""genuine refugees"" won't be able to even make it to Spain, let alone Sweden.

OK joli biais de sélection. Les populations étudiées ne constituent pas un groupe représentatif des populations censées être étudiées et ne permettent donc pas de répondre aux questions posées...

Avec la même méthode, [je te montre qu'il y a une corrélation entre race et capacités cognitives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence#Group_differences)...

D'un point de vue purement statistique, il est nettement plus valorisant, intellectuellement parlant, d'être blanc plutôt que noir ou arabe. Note que je me garde bien d'en conclure un lien de causalité, même si c'est tentant.

&gt;Peux-tu me donner un exemple ou une ce ces ""élites"" se serait ""auto-proclamée"" élite ?

Par exemple [ici](http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Politique/Marine-Le-Pen-au-second-tour-en-2017-Plausible-541302) par Lassalle. J'en ai d'autres, avec Sarko, Borloo, Valls etc.

Ça change quoi que je te donne un exemple ? Rien, t'as essayé de faire ton malin.

&gt;Et un contre-exemple peut-être?

Un contre-exemple de quoi. ""Contre exemple ou une ce ces ""élites"" se serait ""auto-proclamée"" élite"", ça ne veut rien dire.

&gt;Rien que d'un point de vue purement empirique il est évident que l'électorat FN n'est pas constitué des plus brillants de nos concitoyens, bien au contraire.

Que veut dire ""brillant"" ? 

D'un point de vue empirique il est évident que tu n'as jamais mis les pieds dans un local du FN. Et d'ailleurs que tu n'as strictement aucune idée du fonctionnement de la vie politique en France. Va sur le terrain. Fais une campagne. Tape-toi des tractages et des marchés, et reviens ensuite.

&gt;Sinon, comment expliques-tu le fait que le FN ait un mal fou à constituer des listes décentes aux municipales ou aux cantonales?

Pression médiatique et sociale. Être candidat FN a des conséquences sur ta vie sociale, ta vie va être scrutée par les médias, tes collègues vont mal te regarder, quand il n'y a pas d'autres pressions.

&gt;Le FN est un parti éminemment populiste, ça tu ne peux pas le nier .. 

Quelle est ta définition de populiste ? En quoi ne s'applique-t'elle pas aux autres partis ?

&gt;et populisme ne va jamais de paire avec subtilité de l'argumentation

true,notapantsday,native,native,"Many Germans have a lot of trouble rolling the 'r' when they're learning Spanish, so there are definitely different kinds of rolling. The German 'r' is spoken with the back of your mouth, while the Spanish 'r' is spoken with the front (correct me if I'm wrong).

I'm not sure if it's a general rule, but usually the 'r' is only really spoken as a typical German 'r' if it is followed by a vowel, like 'Rad' or 'braun'. In these cases you should try to speak the 'r' more with the back of your mouth than what you're used to from the English 'r'.

If the 'r' is preceded by a vowel, you will rarely hear an actual 'r' in regular colloquial German. If the vowel before the 'r' is an 'a', it is simply stretched out, so ""Bart"" becomes ""Baat"". With the other vowels it's a little more complicated. If you have an 'e' followed by an 'r', the 'e' starts out as usual, but it becomes a bit more like the German 'a' at the end. So ""Erde"" is pronounced more like ""Eade"", but you have to speak ""ea"" as a single vowel, if that makes any sense. In the same way, 'or' becomes 'oa' ('Horde' -&gt; 'Hoade'), 'ur' becomes 'ua' ('Turnen' -&gt; 'Tuanen'), the same for 'ör' and 'ür' and 'är'. The only vowel where it's a bit different is the 'I', it usually becomes darker if it's followed by an 'r', so it becomes a bit more like 'ü' or 'üa'. Still, there are people who speak 'ir' with a ""real"" German 'r' and a bright 'i'. But this is all very advanced stuff and you will find ten year old German natives who are still learning to speak these words properly.

If you always use the typical English 'r', you will just speak with an English accent but people will understand you. By the way, there are regions in Germany where the 'r' is spoken almost as in English:

Then there is an [alveolar trill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_trill), or commonly known as rolled r. This is the r which appears in Spanish. There are lots of dialects which still pronounce this and regions where the pronunciation of r as an alveolar trill is accepted as standard - Bavaria, generally Austria (with a lot of exceptions such as Wien) and some parts of Switzerland. This r is dying in standard German though and is being replaced by another r, described in the next paragraph.

The [uvular trill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvular_trill), also known as simple guttural R is the wide pronunciation of the High German r. It's pronounced the same way as in French. In German, you can hear slight variations. For example, you have the tongue in the same position but leave the rolling out and create a narrow channel to pronounce what's known as [uvular fricative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_uvular_fricative) (there are two versions, voiced and voiceless). But I don't know the actual distribution of these variations.

To sum it up - learn the uvular trill unless you want to live in the southern Germany/Austria one day or want to specifically learn the High German pronunciation of Bavarians or something similar. You can get around pronouncing r as in English but the natives *might* assume you're a foreigner and switch to English (Germans like to do this a lot when they hear any foreigness in the speech).

See wiki pages for the actual pronunciations of r's. There are kind of ""tutorials"" on the pronunciation. Also see /u/notapantsday's comment. I might as well add this. The r can be pronounced even when preceeded by a vowel. But this is known as hypercorrect speech. R followed by a vowel might be pronounced when speaking to the elderly who have hearing problems. Or at the bar with a very loud music. But please, in other ""normal"" situations, don't pronounce the r, if it is preceeded by a vowel.",0,1403583634,null,0,1403583866,0,cifhp6u,t3_28x6xk,t1_cifhp6u,t3_28x6xk,null,1434376299,3,false,German,t5_2qq51,3

Germany greatly benefits from the Eurozone because it depresses their currency allowing  them to export more.

Damn you're projecting hard. We are talking about changing the name a city here, and you've mentioned Berlin so I gave you the Warsaw example.
First of all every person I've met never called the city ""Volgograd"" all of them said something along these lines: ""I'm going on vacation in STALINGRAD"" or ""I have gotten a new job in STALINGRAD"" you see now why people want the name to be changed? Even themselves don't refer to it as ""Volgograd"" the fact that it has the name of a dictator doesn't mean jack. Secondly the history. People who look at the map trying to find Stalingrad the place where the bloodiest battle in history took place will never find it because some twat decided it would be best to change the name (Same goes with Leningrad).
But what I'm even bothering trying to explain this to you. You're more than likely projecting like a mad-man and you won't accept facts. All you think about is ""Hurr durr Russia evil Poland good""

The OECD report showed that immigrants drain at the very least (excluding costs to infrastructure, the judicial system etc) 0.57 of our GDP every year, while our own economists estimate it to be at the very least double that with some putting it as high as 7% of our yearly GDP.

If there was no benefit to EU membership the percentage of overall trade going to the EU would have decreased by now because of the growth of other markets.

I think it's pretty telling that David Cameron, the Conservative PM, is this Europhilic on this issue. Going forward the UK will probably have to further integrate with the EU as fiscal union takes place. I doubt the UK will be allowed to have as much say as the other member states if it were to stay outside of the fiscal union.
