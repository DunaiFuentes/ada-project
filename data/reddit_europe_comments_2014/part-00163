true,RamblinRambo,FINL,Finland,"Even if they did it won't matter. Only 11 % of our energy consumption relies on gas. We've already taken the crazy neighbour into account so the few power plants that use gas are fitted so that they can switch to alternative fuels almost over night. Out heating is also not based on gas so we are completely not reliable of Russian gas like the rest of the continent.

The small parts of our economy that needs gas can be supplied with that gas through other means.

&gt;In 2009 the consumption of energy sources in electricity generation by mode of production was: 28% nuclear power, 16% hydro power, 13% coal, **11% natural gas**, 5% peat and 10% wood fuels and other renewables[...]

&gt;In 2010 the share of gas in TPES was about 10%. Finland was 100% dependent on a single supplier in gas, namely Russia, and there is no gas storage capacity. **However, in Finland, gas is essentially never used in direct heating of homes, which are heated by direct electric heating, oil or district heating.** 75% of gas is used for production of electricity or combined heat and power and in industry, with domestic use being rare. In total, 93% of the gas is sold to large installations directly rather than by retail... **There is an alternative fuel obligation, so that in the event of a gas supply disturbance, other fuels can be immediately substituted.**

---

&gt;In the [Germanic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages), a __strong verb__ is one which marks its past tense by means of changes to the stem vowel ([ablaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_ablaut)). The majority of the remaining verbs form the past tense by means of a [dental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_consonant) [suffix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix) (e.g. *-ed* in English), and are known as *[weak verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_weak_verb)*. A third, much smaller, class comprises the [preterite-present verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterite-present_verb), which are continued in the English auxiliary verbs, e.g. *can/could, shall/should, may/might, must*. The ""[strong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_inflection)"" vs. ""weak"" terminology was coined by the German linguist [Jacob Grimm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Grimm), and the terms ""strong verb"" and ""weak verb"" are direct translations of the original German terms ""starkes Verb"" and ""schwaches Verb"".

Basically Finland is the only neighbouring country they have that can handle the logistics of it and isn't an unreliable state through which companies don't want to ship through. Their own ports in the east of the country don't work either because they are far away from western Russia where the bulk of their population lives. Also the Russian road infrastructure out side major cities is on third-world country levels.

There's a big reason why Finland is so important for Russian import. The newly built St. Petersburg harbour isn't used by most western companies as they simply don't trust the officials so they opt to ship to Finland, mainly Kotka and Hamina from where it is transported to Russia on road from Finland.

You must be uninformed if you think that the EU commissars don't care. They know very well how unpopular immigration from Africa is but they cannot force national governments to accept immigrants from Italy. They can only provide financial support to tackle the problem.

Pour l'histoire du portable : en fait, la technologie est une exception du marché dans le sens que c'est un des rares domaines où les prix baissent au lieu d'augmenter (contrairement aux matières premières, l'immobilier etc.).

&gt; Je comprend qu'aucune idée ne soit parfaite, mais faut bien se décider sur ce vers quoi on tend non?

Si on regarde l'économie du XXe siècle, on se rend compte qu'il n'y a pas de vérité absolue en économie et que s'il existe un système parfait, on ne l'a pas encore trouvé. Évidemment chacun pense ce qu'il veut, mais à mes yeux ces deux camps sont assez extrémistes dans leur vision des choses.

true,shoryukenist,UNSA,NYC,"&gt; Then you have missed the point. Italian territorial waters are Schengen border just as much as the border with Ukraine. And the EU contributes to the expenses for its protection.

Italy is asking for countries to send boats, no one is doing that.  That is what I'm trying to get across here.  Not that there is no money, or agencies.

Would the reason that they do not send boats be that if they pick the migrants up, the migrants must be brought where boat is flagged?  

&gt;They know very well how unpopular immigration from Africa is but they cannot force national governments to accept immigrants from Italy. They can only provide financial support to tackle the problem.

So if one of the agencies you pasted in your response was to set up detention centers in other countries, why wouldn't the other countries accept this?  They could even bring in Italian officials and apply Italian law, since they were trying to enter Italy.  If they qualified for asylum, they get sent to Italy.

Instead, no body does anything, and the immigrants pile in, and the populace becomes more anti-EU.  I just watched a story on the news here; apparently waves of children from Central America have been crossing into Texas to meet their parents who are here illegally.  These children completely overwhelmed the detention center in Texas, so they were all bused to Arizona.  Why can't all these border agencies you listed so something like this?  It isn't as if they are waling the streets, they are confined in a complex.

I also think it is appropriate that Europe does not want a flood of migrants, especially when many countries are already suffering high unemployment.  The US does the same thing.  But by not addressing this in a coordinated manner, where there is no burden on countries who are not on the Mediterranean (besides payments), I don't see how it can work.  And in the end, it leads to the rise of anit-EU parties, and is self-defeating.

Also, years of oppression and isolation from the rest of Spain (also, a very different situation than Catalonia or Euskadi), created sort of a ""inferiority complex"" regarding Galician culture. Yet, the same people that vote for the PP (which is anti-nationalism) speak mostly in Galician and act like independentists. It's a weird situation. Add to that, that some of the nationalist groups even speak of some sort of union or approach to Portugal, due to close ties in language and culture, specially around the Minho river.

There were three sentences which I didn't want to correct for fear of changing the intended meaning, since I couldn't with full certainty tell what you were trying to say. If you give me the English for them, I'll translate them as best I can.

Also, disclaimer: I'm not a native speaker, so I could have missed something. I also am not entirely sure if you should be using the spoken or written past here, since although it is technically spoken, it is also a prepared speech, which would be reason to use the written past. In any case, I did change all the instances of ""ist gewesen"" to ""war"", since you should typically use the written past of ""sein"" and modal auxiliaries, even when talking. 

Could we get a native speaker to confirm on which past should be used for the other verbs?

Edit: formatting

true,foca9,NORW,Norge,"""It costs too much"" is not exactly the only argument against monarchy. And what you mentioned may be the only two arguments *for* monarchy (""it's good to have a non-political symbol"" and ""people want it""). 

The highest power in Norway is hereditary. The members of the royal family lacks normal rights like the right to vote, can't work with whatever they want, have no religious freedom, marriage needs the king's consent. The monarchy is based on a referendum in 1905, where only men had the right to vote. The money stuff is the last thing I care about, but sure, that should be an argument as well. The king is ""holy"", can't be held accountable. Märtha's angel business, Mette-Marit's surrogate thing.

For me, it's no doubt. The monarchy is anachronistic, and does not belong in a modern society.

But of course, he's (they're) hugely popular. And the Kingdom of Norway is going to stand as it is for many years more. But that doesn't make it any more ""right"", in a principle, liberal and democratic sense. You're free to think it's nice to have a royal family, but in my view, there aren't any sensible, objective arguments to keep the monarchy.

We by the way already did write a new constitution this year: Made some changes, and then translated it into two new versions.

The EU agency cannot set up detention centres in other countries(EU has far too little power, almost all power is in the hands of national governments). This is negotiated between the government of the country and EU? (not exactly sure about the procedure)... and not only EU. [Every time our PM or president meets US](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/11/21/readout-vice-president-biden-s-meeting-prime-minister-robert-fico-slovak) president [2-4 Guantanamo prisoners end up in our detention camps](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/final-three-uighur-prisoners-moved-from-us-military-prison-at-guantanamo-bay/2013/12/31/834c1eea-7220-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html). So Obama can close Guantanamo...

&gt; Italy is asking for countries to send boats, no one is doing that. That is what I'm trying to get across here. Not that there is no money, or agencies.

In all honesty, I don't have an idea why Italy does not have enough boats/other EU countries don't offer them boats... All I know is that EU does care very much about immigrration and they do pay to take care about it. Our Schengen border ~95 km with Ukraine was mostly financed with money from EU. see my original post.

&gt;  But by not addressing this in a coordinated manner, where there is no burden on countries who are not on the Mediterranean (besides payments), I don't see how it can work. And in the end, it leads to the rise of anit-EU parties, and is self-defeating.

Other than that, I have no real, or appropriate, moral opinion because I am not British nor in tune with the tension &amp; problems on the ground.

That said, I worry that this will negatively impact NATO. The United States &amp; France will be forced to shoulder more of the continent's defense burdens because of a weakened United Kingdom.

We may end up having to divert more resources and forces from the Pacific &amp; Asia to compensate for a weaker British military in relation to Europe. This would dilute our ""Pivot to the Pacific"" which I personally consider to be of utomost importance to my country in the coming century.

I'm also worried about France, as they've already been stretched to the max after having to cut their military budget due to economic difficulties. This will force them to stretch themselves even further I believe, and if that doesn't work, force the United States to divert more resources &amp; support to help them in their obligations to the continent &amp; if they need help in North Africa.

I also worry about our closest ally on the global scene being severely weakened, not just in hard power as I mentioned above, but in soft power as well.

Now they're simply trying to delay the inevitable. In the future, I believe, they will be just about entirely elected *(perhaps with 10-20% still retaining their seats by tradition/monarch selection)*. Making the entire chamber directly or in-directly *(by each country's respective legislature)* elected wouldn't be that much of a jump in such a scenario. 

And what I describe is a federal-system of government. The same type employed by the United States, Germany, Australia &amp; Canada. There would still be a federal legislature passing laws that have supremacy over your own *(although you would have constitutional protections)*, but the Scots would have a much larger and influential voice than they do now in Westminster *(which IIRC is one of the main source of tensions)*.

An I don't think the states of America, Germany &amp; Australia, nor the providences of Canada, would still be able to do what they do, or be as influential on the global scene as they are, as separate countries.

**EDIT:** And also, this proposed ""British Senate"" would have a lot more authority than the House of Lords, on par with the Commons, with perhaps a set-up like the United States with each house having exclusive powers over certain issues; like the Commons having sole authority to propose/draft budgets *(which the Senate can still vote down)* and the Senate having ""advice &amp; consent"" powers for confirming the nominations of cabinet members/public officials and approving things like treaties and such. 

Everything else must be bounced-back between each house and any other bill can be proposed in either chamber *(I don't believe this is the case with the present British Parliament, as IIRC, the House of Lords is severely regulated and it's authority very constricted in comparison to the Commons)*.",0,1402274334,null,0,1402276111,0,ci2knj1,t3_27myjk,t1_ci2knj1,t1_ci2kdi4,null,1434152646,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I don't like that Jennifer Rostock shit, the song is 'meh' and pretty generic. She doesn't even sing good and the song just sounds awful.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"It was different. Obviously, a lot of bad shit did happen under him. Just a little bit of German ethnic cleansing after World War 2.

But in general, Tito worked very hard to keep Yugoslavia independent from the USSR and US as its own Socialist state, and Tito was instrumental in forming the Non-Aligned Movement. He managed to play both sides against eachother and ended up receiving financial aide from both the USSR and the US. There was a time where Yugoslavia had even better relations with America than it did with the Soviets.

People worked less hours, but things still got done. There wasn't much Capitalist enterprise other than small little local shops like bakeries. While most of the stuff was owned by the state itself, it was actively collectively managed by the workers! And because of Tito's political savvy in playing off the USSR and USA against one another, Yugoslavia had a much broader export market than many other states at the time. So, I wouldn't say business was booming, but it wasn't in a state of collapse or perpetual struggle either.

Education was massively expanded and under Tito, over 16 universities were founded. 

Socially, Yugoslavia, being a Socialist Federal Republic, was rather multicultural, based on unity around the differences between the people in the federal states, with a very strong emphasis on brotherhood.

With that said, there was a very high level of emigration from Yugoslavia as a whole, so much so that the population growth was pretty much breaking even. This was caused by more or less endemic unemployment, millions of Yugoslavs emigrated to the Western side of the iron curtain looking for jobs.

There were tonnes of public works, the infrastructure in Former Yugoslav countries today was created under Tito. Things like electrifying the railways, tram systems, and motorways.

Anyways, I could ramble on.

Reality is, it's not easy to get your hands on good material(in English) covering SFRY at the time, so a lot of even what I just said there can be inaccurate, especially seeing as your question is really so broad as Tito was in power for going on 4 decades.

However, the collapse of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Wars occurred as a result of the dramatic rise in ethnic nationalism, which Tito himself had managed to control during his time in power, with the big emphasis on Pan-Slavic Brotherhood.

It's quite hard to say whether or not things were definitively worse under Tito or not, as globally conditions have changed, with the collapse of the USSR and the advent of neoliberal economic globalization, so we can't really know how Tito would be running the show in the Balkans anymore.

For example, you know how to derive the ""standard"" endings for present indicative: -e, -est, -t, -en, -et, -en or something like that.

Now *essen* is strong. So give it the standard endings for everything, but then you change the stem's vowel for only the *er/sie/es* and *du* forms.

ich esse (regular)

du isst (irregular, e -&gt; i)

er/sie/es isst (irregular, e-&gt;i)

In any case, the Turks in Germany don't feel appreciated because they aren't for the most part. Not because Germans are necessarily racist or anti-immigration but because many Turkish refuse to assimilate. Erdogan even stated that ""assimilation is a crime against humanity"".

true,tealeg,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Having lived in Bavaria, and now in Lower Saxony I can confirm that there are distinct cultural elements, but there are other regions with distinct cultures, and besides there's more than one distinct culture and dialect within the region of Bavaria.  I can also tell you that the feeling is not just in one direction, many Bavarians feel very different from the North.  They make jokes about them, and there's a fairly prominent Bavarian Independence party.
 
I suspect that the history you mention is a big part of it.  Although what is now Germany was many, many small principalities in the past, there was a broad division between the Prussians in the North and the Bavarians in he south - particularly as those two took opposite sides in the Napoleonic wars. 

You can also look beyond Germany's borders.  The borders between countries may be sharply defined on maps, but Europe has always had a sort of cultural continuum.  Southern Bavaria is almost indistinguishable from North West Austria (and Bavarian Independence campaigners claim a chunk of that for themselves too).  Meanwhile in the North West of Germany there are cultures and dialects (Plattdeutsch, or Low German) that could easily merge into Holland and Denmark and the Baltic states.

Today, probably the biggest factors keeping the animosity going are 1. that outsiders (particularly Americans) hold stereotypes for Germany that are mostly based on Bavarian culture, and 2. that Munich (in particular) has grown rich and the Bavarians have pushed to be allowed to not send us much of their tax revenue to the pool for all states for redistribution to poorer areas.  This is seen as ""not playing the game"", especially as Bavaria was a big beneficiary of such payments in the past. 

Oh.. and there's a different Aldi in the South - that's probably it actually ;-)",0,1402292484,null,0,false,0,ci2rrs6,t3_27o8yj,t1_ci2rrs6,t3_27o8yj,null,1434156066,47,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,47
true,bittercode,UNSA,Lives in Hungary,"Maybe - but for what it is worth I didn't say business was against immigration. I said they are against legal immigration. It's not like people don't currently immigrate into the USA. Illegals provide a large pool of cheap labor that can't really fight for any kind of rights from the employers.

So I think the status quo - millions of workers in the US without proper documentation is desirable by the people in charge. If it weren't I think we'd have seen something done by now.

The exception would be highly skilled workers, and there you see business pushing for more visas each year. But again they don't want to dismantle the whole thing or make it easier in general. They just want to broaden their ability to cherry pick a certain set of people to bring in above board.

I think borders aren't about keeping people out but more about control. I think the nationalist/right wing types that get really up in arms about border/immigration control (all over the world not just in the US) are basically a tool for the people who actually run things and have it in their tool set as another method to push things in the direction they want.",0,1402292493,null,0,false,0,ci2rrw2,t3_27lotq,t1_ci2rrw2,t1_ci2rkss,null,1434156067,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Actually you did right here. 

&gt;And big business benefits greatly from the current situation. I think the fact that NAFTA was able to pass but nothing has happened in immigration reform in forever is a good indicator that the people who are actually in charge don't want immigration reform.

/

&gt;I think the nationalist/right wing types that get really up in arms about border/immigration control (all over the world not just in the US) are basically a tool for the people who actually run things and have it in their tool set as another method to push things in the direction they want.

/r/conspiratard 

Nationalists are toxic and no one wants to use them or be on their side. Big business would like borders to be as open as possible to lower labour costs and increase profits. Large scale legal immigration would do this. Your entire understanding of this is based on a convoluted and contradictory conspiracy theory that is not based on evidence. 

The actual reason that we do not have more free movement of labour in the Americas is because the public is against it.

EDIT: Edited in some explanations (optional). Also, /u/23PowerZ's version is really good as well.
2. EDIT: Found another sentence I would like to clarify on

&gt; Nach ~~Zweite~~ **dem zweiten** Weltkrieg haben die Allierten Deutschland und Berlin ~~abgetrennt~~ **aufgeteilt**

""Abgetrennt"" would imply that Germany was split from Berlin. ""Aufgeteilt"" implies that Germany and Berlin were both split up. ""Geteilt"" would make both interpretations possible, but the more likely one (for me at least) would be the former. If you wanted to use ""geteilt"" and make it clear that both were split up, you could say ""sowohl Deutschland als auch Berlin"" or ""Deutschland sowie Berlin"", but that sounds pretty weird to me.

&gt; Die Allierten haben zwei ~~Länder erzeugt~~ **Staaten gegründet**: die BRD und die DDR oder **Ost-** und **Westdeutschland**

""Erzeugt"" would be similar to ""produced"", whereas ""gegründet"" means ""founded"". ""Länder"" can also be used for ""Staaten"" but is informal and not as precise (""Länder"" can also mean ""Länder"" in the sense of ""Bundesländer""). ""Ost- und Westdeutschland"" is optional (you could also use ""Ostdeutschland und Westdeutschland"") but the former is better style.

&gt; Nikita Khrushchev hat **diesen** ~~aufgehört~~ **beendet**

""Aufgehört"" would mean that he has stopped with something he himself did, while ""beendet"" means that he has made something stop.

&gt; **Über** die Jahre ~~haben~~ **wurden** **Verbesserungsmaßnahmen**  ~~zu die~~ **an der** Berliner Mauer ~~gemacht~~ **vorgenommen**.

While ""Verbesserungsmaßnahmen"" isn't wrong in this context, I couldn't think of the verb that would fit it. I *think* that ""vorgenommen"" is correct, but I'm not entirely sure. If you want to take no risks, you can replace ""Verbesserungsmaßnahmen"" with ""Verbesserungen"" and leave the rest of the sentence as it is.

&gt; **Michail Gorbatschow ist** 1985 ~~der Führer von~~ **das Staatsoberhaupt** der USSR geworden.

Germans don't like the word ""Führer"" because of Hitler. It's better to avoid it when possible (unless you're talking about Hitler). If you have to use it, use ""Anführer"" instead. To my knowledge it's not wrong to include the word ""von"" here, but it's better style if you leave it out.

&gt; **Er hat** viele **neue Grundsätze** ~~gemacht~~ **geschaffen**

/u/23PowerZ replaced this with ""Er hat für viele Veränderungen gesorgt"". Which one is correct depends on what you want to say. ""Grundsätze"" means ""principles"" or can be used as a synonym for ""Leitlinien"" (""Guidelines""), while ""Veränderungen"" means ""changes"".

&gt; Die Sinatra-Doktrin hat ~~Warschauer Pakt Staaten machen~~ ** es den Staaten des Warschauer Paktes erlaubt,** ~~dein~~ **ihre** eigenen ~~Regeln~~ **Gesetze zu machen**

""Gesetze zu machen"" is a bit informal, but I wanted to stay as close to the original as possible as long as it didn't make it sound weird. If you want to be formal, it would be ""Gesetze einzuführen"". Given the context, ""erlaubt, ihre Angelegenheiten unabhängig von der USSR zu regeln"" would be more accurate as far as I know. If you want to have no possibiity of saying anything wrong, you can use /u/23PowerZ's version ""mehr Freiräume"", however this isn't very specific.

&gt; ~~Dann~~ **Am neunten** November ~~neun~~ 1989~~,~~ **hat ein** ~~Ost Deutschland official~~ **ostdeutscher Politiker** hat eine Bekanntmachung ~~gesagt~~ **gegeben**.

In german it is only possible to say ""neunter November"" (""The ninth of November""), not ""November neun"" (""November nine""). I also struggled to translate ""Eastern Germany official"", as there's no commonly used direct equivalent to ""official"" in german (""Offizieller"" gets used, but rarely). While you can translate it with ""Beamter"", the word ""Beamter"" only means employed by the state, so it doesn't have to be someone related to politics. If you translate it with ""Politiker"" like I did, it can only mean a politician, and not some other official involved in politics. In this context however, it is correct. /u/23PowerZ's version, ""Hochrangiger ostdeutscher"", also works and probably comes closer to the original meaning.

&gt; Viele Personen ~~hat~~ **sind daraufhin** zu ~~die~~ **der Mauer** gegangen.

""Daraufhin"" isn't necessary, but it makes it clear that it was caused by the announcement.

&gt; und **Getrenntseins** gewesen.

If you're talking about seperateness in general, this is correct. If you mean the seperation of Germany and Berlin in particular, it would have to be ""der Teilung"" instead.

&gt; **Symbol** ~~von~~ **der** Vereinigung

Whether to use ""von"" or ""der"" in this case depends on what kind of ""Vereinigung"" you mean. If you are talking specifically of the reunion of Germany,. you'd have to use ""der"". If you're talking about union in general, ""von"" would be the better choice (though as far as I know both is correct). If you wanted to make it clear that you mean the reunion, you can replace ""Vereinigung"" with ""Wiedervereinigung"".

&gt; Die Berliner Mauer ist die ~~beste~~ **beliebteste Sehenswürdigkeit in** Berlin.

If you want to say that your personal opinion is that the Berlin Wall is the best sight in Berlin, ""beste"" is correct. If you however want to say that it's the most popular, ""beliebteste"" would be the correct option.

\3. EDIT: The use of the Perfekt in this text also seemed very weird to me at some points, but it might very well be correct (never knew about what tense should be used in what type of text, also I had to look up on wikipedia what ""Perfekt"" even is, as I mostly do grammar by feel (as is pretty natural for a native afaik)) and if it is the way you are supposed to do it, just do it that way.

This lady has no idea what she's talking about. It's not about appreciation. Mexican-Americans wouldn't give a rats ass about the President of Mexico because they see themselves as Americans, and ones who left Mexico because they wanted a better life in a better country. Cheering for the President of Mexico is cheering for the dude who made you want to leave Mexico in the first place. It makes very little sense for a Mexican and even less sense for an American citizen. Many Mexican-Americans are from families who were marginalized in Mexico, received little or no services and had very few opportunities. That's why so many of them were willing to immigrate illegally and live in the US under the risk of being caught everyday. I think the failure of the Mexican government in recent years to effectively contain and control the drug violence has alienated Mexican-Americans even more. 

Public appreciation has never been the driving force behind immigration to the US or assimilation. Being rounded up into internment camps didn't make Japanese-Americans any less American. In fact it spurred many young Japanese-Americans to volunteer to fight in the war to prove themselves and their loyalty. Many immigrant groups faced discrimination in the United States.

true,Sle,BERL,Berlin,"I feel appreciated enough. I'm learning the language and don't expect any breaks, but the country has treated me extremely well in my view, way above what I could have hoped for. I've faced a little hostility because of my initial poor German, but that was fixed as soon as I could possibly do anything about it and it was nothing different that what I would naturally expect.

I'm in Berlin, so I'm not sure how this relates to other areas of the country, but when I first got here I was working with lots of Turks and Arabs in catering. I found them to be very warm, friendly and curious (I'm English, so maybe that had an influence on their treatment of me) but also marginalised. I felt like I was party to a world that was invisible, unseen. 

It was clear that none of these kids were going to progress very far outside of the business we were in and their education seemed to have gone badly. The older guys were friendly, but a little bitter. Even so, during the time I worked there, I didn't really hear any outright complaints.

I also know very successful, upwardly mobile Turkish people here on the other hand, but of course not as many as white Germans or Western immigrants.

true,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"As far as claiming Bavaria isn't really Germany, I think that's mostly Germans reacting to tourists who gravitate toward Munich, Neuschwanstein and Rothenburg, and return home having visited ""Germany"". On the other hand, there are a few Bavarians who will loudly claim, to anyone who listens, that the formation of the Federal Republic of Germany was illegal and therefore void, and Bavaria is still an independent kingdom. But there aren't many of those.

Bavaria would probably welcome a little more autonomy. The Bavarian Constitution treats Bavaria as a sovereign state, article 8 graciously bestowing on ""German citizens"" residing within Bavaria the same rights and responsibilities as ""Bavarian citizens"" (compared with, for example, the Hessian Constitution which, in its preamble, specifically states that Hesse is a constituent of ""the German Republic""). This doesn't cause any problem, because states can write whatever they like in their constitutions; if there's any conflict with federal law, federal law applies.

Mostly, though, you need to understand that while Germans are very reluctant to show any kind of national pride (except during the World Cup), they will wholeheartedly embrace local, regional pride. And the Bavarians give as good as they get.

For the most part it's friendly rivalry, but some people do take it slightly too far. I live in the very north-west of Bavaria; I can look out of my window and see the hills marking the border with Hesse. On the other side of those hills, the people are cultural ignoramuses, materialistic, slightly stupid (parents of children who struggle in Bavarian schools send them to Hessian schools because the exams are easier) and they can't drive.

You can roughly divide Germany into the up-tight efficient north (where Prussia was the dominant power) and the backward, easy-going south (where the dominant power was Bavaria), which is why you sometimes hear Bavarians complaining about ""bloody Prussians"".

But every region has its local pride, and every region is made fun of. A typical joke runs like this: A Prussian, a Bavarian and a Swabian are enjoying a beer. Into each beer, a fly falls. The Prussian immediately demands another beer. The Bavarian picks out the fly and carries on drinking. The Swabian picks out the fly and then forces it to spit out the beer it's swallowed.

Of course, if you're in Rheinland-Pfalz, you probably know that Bavaria once ruled the Pfalz region for about 100 years.

Again talking of noble people and their territories, all right. The king of the Crown of Aragon married the queen of Castille, thus their descendants inherit both territories.

Conditions in the cities were quite poor. So we thought 'Yes! Oil was found off the shores of our country, so we're going to have money spent on us to improve our conditions' and that just wasn't true. Yes some money was given to us but many people continued to live in abhorrent conditions and cities were filthy, and in need of a money injection. 

So that's kind of a bit of the history of oil and Scotland.

Io sto parlando di casi ben determinati, quando in una relazione la donna sfrutta l'uomo ed è abusiva nei suoi confronti. **NON** intendo perpetuare argomenti generalisti quali le donne sono tutte uguali, le donne sono tutte sfruttatrici. Io parlo di situazioni nelle quali l'uomo viene completamente schiacciato dalla donna, il quale ha quindi bisogno di recuperare un punto di vista razionale.

Campioncino, hai toppato in ogni caso, pessimo tentativo di processo alle intenzioni. Ma forse neanche dovevo utilizzare la parola femminismo, perché io parlo di tutti quei casi (tra i quali rientra anche il femminismo tossico), nei quali ci sono double standard così subdoli che nessuna delle parti se ne accorge neanche.

Perché se io uomo, se una sera non c'ho voglia di scopare, devo farlo per forza dato che per la società l'uomo deve avere SEMPRE voglia di scopare? Perché se ho una defaillance perché magari mi sono distratto, perché magari non mi sta piacendo il sesso con te, devo essere preso per il culo come impotente? E perché le donne possono permettersi il lusso invece di fare queste cose?

Cambiando area di argomento, tutte quelle donne che fanno leva sulla loro bellezza per ricevere favori, regali, ecc. ecc., be' un uomo dovrebbe darsi una svegliata e smetterla di pensare col cazzo, accorgersi che quella è una cretina e quindi perseguire la *propria* felicità, che non è conquistare la più fica della comitiva, ma trovare una ragazza con la quale avere un felice rapporto funzionale. 

La parte interessante di questo subreddit è che ti sta dicendo che le donne hanno un immenso potere contrattuale, e quindi è facile restare invischiati in una relazione dove l'uomo è in una situazione di asservimento. Tutto il resto, alpha e beta, donne oggetto di sesso, ecc ecc sono cazzate da macho, ma quella porzione di messaggio sana resta innegabilmente un ottimo modo per un uomo per imparare a maturare capacità relazionali.",0,1402302266,null,0,false,0,ci2u37k,t3_27na7q,t1_ci2u37k,t1_ci2ks3j,null,1434157422,0,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,0

true,cristobalcolon,liguria,,"Dipende tanto dall'uso che ne fai e dall'assetto che dai alla macchina. Ti faccio 3 esempi di mezzi che ho avuto.

Suzuki samurai 1.3 (passo lungo) tutto originale che consumava come un elicottero. 12km a litro col piedino leggero, ridotte e pedale giù portavano i consumi a 8-10 km litro. Però pagavo poco di bollo ed assicurazione. Ricambi medio-costosi.

Lada Niva 1.7 con l'impianto a gpl, consumava poco fino a che non l'ho rialzato, montato gomme larghe e con tacchettatura da trattore. A quel punto (anche se a gpl) i consumi si sono fatti ""importanti"" (10-12 km a litro). Ricambi economicissimi.

Land Rover Defender 2.5 td5, aerodinamica di una cassapanca, rialzato, gomme larghe (255) tacchettato medio, un sacco di zavorra aggiuntiva (bull bar, compressore, etc..), consumi nei 12-14 km a litro. Ricambi (non originali) economici.

Per darti un idea (vaga) io per il Defender immatricolato autocarro pagavo 850 eurini di assicurazione annua. I bolli, ovviamente, in base alla potenza variano parecchio tra un mezzo e l'altro.

Un esempio di fuoristrada tranquillo (ma validissimo) ed abbastanza economico è il Suzuki Vitara, ma rigorosamente diesel (1.9 td o 2.0 hdi, il 1.6 benzina  ha consumi raccapriccianti).

Then don't? What integration problem does the US have that's comparable to what's going in Germany? The notion that immigrants (largely Hispanics) are coming, not learning English, and resorting to crime is patently false and overblown. What the US has is not a integration problem but rather a sheer number of immigrants and socio-economic problems that have more to do with being passed from one generation to the next rather than integration (see: African-Americans)

[By the second generation, Americans from immigrant backgrounds are already on par if not surpassing the general American population in income, education, and poverty rates. English proficiency rates are high and a majority drop their ancestoral languages.](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/02/07/second-generation-americans/)

Integration in the US isn't the issue. It's illegal immigration. You have a whole group referred to as DREAMers who were foreign-born, brought as children to the US illegally, and are stuck in a limbo of being Americans for all intents and purposes, identify as Americans but are currently indefinitely barred from obtaining citizenship or even legal status because of their illegal immigrant status.

&gt; This is false.

&gt; [...]

&gt; These video recordings also disprove the claim that the cause of the destruction was an explosion from inside the building.

&gt; [...]

&gt; There is also the opinion that the MPADS operator was firing at a Ukrainian plane, but the missile was distracted by the heat of an air conditioner, installed on the RSA building. This is also false. 

&gt; [...]

&gt; Theory: the plane was not firing, but was letting off flares to defend against missiles. This is untrue.

They literally debunk all theories that it was anything other than an airstrike, thus confirming that it was indeed an airstrike.

Questo è l'esatto opposto di tutto quello che il femminismo predica riguardo le relazioni romantiche e il sesso. Ma tipo l'opposto diametrale, nero e bianco, giorno e notte, zero e infinito.

&gt;Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is on his way to Brussels to have a difficult conversation with his fellow defense ministers in NATO. The point of contention is the continued reduction of the military capabilities of our allies and their growing dependence on U.S. support.

&gt;Hagel will repeat to European allies the stark message made by Robert Gates on his last trip to Brussels as defense secretary. Gates made international headlines with his warning of “a dim, if not dismal future” for NATO if it continues to be divided “between those willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments, and those who enjoy the benefits of NATO membership… but don’t want to share the risks and the costs.”

&gt;America was visibly reluctant to get involved, let alone lead the action. And, having helped to knock out Libya's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes, it pulled back from the front-line operations. But America's role remains essential, not least in providing air-to-air refuelling, as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the European allies.

You most likely have a shitty job at a factory which is physically very taxing. At the same time you have to raise your children and take care of them in an enviroment you don't know very well (this is a big factor).
You come home tired and want to spend some time with your family. There is actually no time to go to courses to learn a new language (which didn't even really exist back then btw). You just learn the language as you pick it up on a day to day basis by interacting with working colleagues and/or store clerks.
Interacting with work colleagues tends to be a bit difficult, because those often have a negative attitude towards the outlandish newcomers who don't speak their language very well. Many times expecting them to be linguistic prodigies able to learn a new language in no time (""if not, fuck them!"").
I would never expect someone who imigrated to my country to be able to speak the language very well. Even after 40 years or more.

It's a different story with their children who were born here tho. They should be able to speak the language just as well as everybody else.

On a side note: It always seems to be the low educated citizens of a country to cry out for foreigners to be able to speak their language better. Maybe because they dont have the capacity to see the bigger picture. Unfortunately those are also always the most vocal group of people.

On another side note: I live in Germany and whenever I see/meet germans who imigrated to the country of my holiday destination they NEVER speak more than a handful of words of the local language and in addition to that tend to only socialize with other germans.

I own a travel agency here in Barcelona and rent boats to group of friends all the time. 
Most boats in Barcelona are limited to 11 persons (+ skipper). For a group of 20 people, you don't have many options:

- Renting a medium-sized, luxury catamaran for up to 23 people. The price is 88€/person (if you are 12, 15, or 20 people, the price remains 88€/person, but yes, the boat is privatized). This is quite expensive, but the service is great (includes beer, cava, a few snacks). 
- Renting two sailboats with skipper. The price would be 450€/per boat for 4 hours, and includes a few beers (about 24 per boat). This is relatively cheap, and you get to spend a great afternoon.
- The last option would be the big catamaran, shared with other groups, and yes, a lot of bachelor parties. 46€/person for 3 hours with 5 drinks and a BBQ.

I would recommend the 2nd option. It is possible to rent it for 2h30 or 6, 8hours, but 4 hours is the best compromise. If you're interested, let me know.

Future warfare is going to be quick, limited &amp; decisive to avoid nuclear confrontation or conventional escalation. Crimea is the perfect example of this. An it will be like this because none of us want to go bald and piss blood in a nuclear holocaust unless it's absolutely inevitable. So to counter this Europe must improve the capabilities it is lacking in, particular, power projection that is grounded in logistics &amp; intelligence. 

It is lacking severely in this, as evidenced in the other articles I linked here. A war in the Baltics, in my armchair general opinion, is going to be fought and decided in it's opening stages. Europe, once again in my opinion, can not win such a war without heavy American support and assistance. 

[**A Chinese Admiral Sums it up Best**](http://nation.time.com/2013/02/20/chinese-view-of-islands-conflict-make-it-quick/)

&gt;*“The battle to take over the Diaoyu Islands would not be a conventional operation. For either party involved in the war, it would be very difficult to employ their full military capabilities, because there would be no time for them to fully unfold in the fight. The real fight would be very short. It is very possible the war would end in a couple of days or even in a few hours,”* said PLA Navy Rear Admiral Yin Zhou, a former director of the Navy Institute of Strategic Studies, in a recent primetime special on Beijing TV.

&gt;Japan and China have been squabbling over a group of tiny, uninhabited islands that the former calls Senkaku, and the latter, Diaoyu.

&gt;*“The keys to winning the war are quick actions, and good planning,”* says Zhou, a frequent commentator on military issues.  *“First, the troops that go into the battle must be well-trained, elite troops. Second, the troops must have precision strike capabilities. Once surface targets or air targets are chosen, the troops must be able to hit those targets immediately and precisely. Good planning also refers to accurately grasping the enemy’s situation, especially its operational (troop and ship) dispositions. We have to be very clear which disposition is the key and then plan our operations accordingly.”*

But you might say Johnny, even if Russia wins such a battle, CLEARLY we'll just launch a massive counter-attack and re-take it in a matter of weeks or months. And you might be right, but than again:

[**Why Russia calls a limited nuclear strike ""de-escalation""**](http://thebulletin.org/why-russia-calls-limited-nuclear-strike-de-escalation)

&gt;In 1999, at a time when renewed war in Chechnya seemed imminent, Moscow watched with great concern as NATO waged a high-precision military campaign in Yugoslavia. The conventional capabilities that the United States and its allies demonstrated seemed far beyond Russia’s own capacities. And because the issues underlying the Kosovo conflict seemed almost identical to those underlying the Chechen conflict, Moscow became deeply worried that the United States would interfere within its borders.

&gt;By the next year, Russia had issued a new military doctrine whose main innovation was the concept of “de-escalation”—the idea that, if Russia were faced with a large-scale conventional attack that exceeded its capacity for defense, it might respond with a limited nuclear strike. To date, Russia has never publically invoked the possibility of de-escalation in relation to any specific conflict. But Russia’s policy probably limited the West’s options for responding to the 2008 war in Georgia. And it is probably in the back of Western leaders’ minds today, dictating restraint as they formulate their responses to events in Ukraine.

This is why all future warfare, in my opinion, is going to be based around the foundation of power projection. Not how Europe is geared now for a drawn-out defensive war where you got time to get your shit together. And has I mentioned probably a dozen times in this thread, Europe is severely lacking in this regard.

So until the European Union can respond quickly and effectively at a moment's notice to such a scenario, to the degree that the United States can now, you'll be reliant on us.",0,1402308003,null,0,1402308299,0,ci2v0xx,t3_27oel4,t1_ci2v0xx,t1_ci2uwsw,null,1434157862,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Regardless of what you think of the USSR, it was doubtless a dramatic improvement over the Czars for the vast majority of people. Serfdom had only been abolished in the 1860s.

By many accounts, serfdom had devolved into conditions not dissimilar from chattel slavery as it was practiced in the U.S.  This was not uniform, but the country was so vast and ethnically fractured that there was little oversight.  Corruption was endemic.  Many could do whatever they wanted to whoever they wanted.  Even traditional counter-balances to the excesses of the nobility, such as the clergy and mercantile classes, were much less strong in Russia.  While they did have a strong clergy, it was heavily state controlled. The worst of the Soviets was closer to the 'norm' for the people under the Czars.

The USSR brought culture, literature, education, electricity, healthcare, decent living conditions, and so on to millions of people.  Despite generally being considered worse off than their counterparts in the west, Soviet citizens were provided a dignity previous unheard of.  From the context of a Western perspective, the Soviet Union was harsh, brutal, and completely undesirable.  Compared to what Russia had before then (and arguably has now), the Russians will likely view the Soviet period more and more favorably.

The key figure from that period has to be Stalin. Once again, despite the many atrocities, tough times called for tough measures.  The sacrifice of the peoples constituting the Soviet Union during World War 2 cannot be overstated.  Millions upon millions died to halt the German advance and then push all the way to Berlin.  The state-caused starvation, the purges, and so on will probably fall more into obscurity as time passes and I believe Russians will remember him as the leader necessary to stop Hitler and view most of his actions as necessary to preserve the good that came.

Germany is a socialist state not a welfarestate and not America. And cheaters in the system is a problem but the authorities also, it is complicated very complicated.

&gt; When I lived in the US, I felt that as a German with a Turkish and Arab background that I was very welcome. When it was time for me to return to Germany, people wanted me to stay - I was thrilled by this concept of being accepted so quickly. My friends and work colleagues considered me part of the US; they accepted me for who I am. The idea that I went there to become a part of their country was something they really respected.

That concept won't work in Germany. The concept that would work in Germany would see the individual contributing to the society, which then in turn gives back to the individual. We need to sit down with some key people to create a new concept and then teach this to our children and politicians so everyone understands it.

Wut? She know germany is socialist and think we have to make it to a capitalist state? What is with: Go fuck yourself to america?

&gt;  Are you optimistic that this change can happen? I am. You have to remember, 60 years ago when immigrants first starting coming to Germany from Turkey and Southern Europe, the immigrants were not educated. Their children were also at a disadvantage. The third generation began to study and to join the professional class. Today, we have a growing population of educated 'new Germans' who are starting to speak for themselves. This is why I think things are changing, and why I am optimistic.

Third generation = New Germans    I leave this alone...

Growing population of educated who are starting to speak for themselves. They can start at the beginning if they want, it is a democratie. And no, the system does not change magnificent.

true,avataRJ,FINL,Finland,"For the follow-up question: In 1918, [Finland was declared a kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Finland_%281918%29). This was justified as needing ""stable leadership"" and things like that after the civil war. The issue is that there was no royal family, so the monarchists started digging the law books. Since the legislation had been quite stagnant, they found the Swedish Instrument of Government of 1772. Since Finland had originally inherited Swedish laws, and the law hadn't been repealed, technically it was still valid (despite the fact than Finland had been declared a republic in the declaration of independence). So they went on to elect a king.

Now, this is the very end of the WW I. The Germans had helped Finnish Whites to beat the Reds, so to maintain strong ties a German prince was elected, Friedrich Karl of Hesse. (Originally they'd wanted a junior son of the Kaiser, but this was not okay to the Germans.) The election was concluded on 9th of October. Der Kaiser abdicated on 9th of November, and on 14th of December our king-elect renounced the throne. Republicans won the next election. Some Finnish papers like to keep track fo the pretender, though.

In order to change the constitution, either two successive parliaments must accept the change by a 2/3 majority, or the parliament must consider it urgent by 5/6 majority and then confirm any changes by 2/3 majority. Any exceptions to the constitution can be also accepted similarly, most notably what is considered the dark spot of Finnish democracy - the extension of president Urho Kekkonen's third term by four years.

The powers of the president have been very much given to the parliament and/or council of state (government) or removed altogether after the reign of Urho I (25 years as the president - after that, a limit of 2x6 years was introduced). Originally the office of the president carried many of the powers that would have belonged to the monarch, and occasionally it was joked that Finland was the ""only Nordic monarchy"" (the other Nordics being monarchies with ceremonial heads-of-state, and Finland being a republic with a strong president).",0,1402309680,null,0,1402309862,0,ci2vavy,t3_27mtw0,t1_ci2vavy,t3_27mtw0,null,1434157992,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I'm pretty sure that Turks in Turkey don't recognize immigrants (if there are any) as Turks.

It takes a while for a country to accept immigrants as nationals and integral parts of society. Currently, this sort of acceptance is only widespread in Western countries. Try being an immigrant, or of immigrant origins in a non-Western country, and see how you fare there. Especially if you're as numerous as immigrants are in Western countries.

It's a complex situation, but the effort must come from both parties. I have no doubt some seemingly well integrated Turks have a hard time, but maybe they should understand that other members of their community aren't as desirable as they are. Maybe they should pool their efforts in improving their community, rather than trying to change German society into accepting the unacceptable.

Stating there is a long waiting period and that it would be faster if I looked somewhere else as that particular gym is already too crowded.
I thought that those are legitimate reasons for a rejection for a gym membership. I went to the same gym in person and introduced myself with a german name. I got shown around the gym and was pushed to sign the contract on the spot. I was appalled.

I asked myself if this would have happened more often if I didn't look german and came to the conclusion that it might be very well the case.

Et je suis d'accord avec ta phrase initiale (en tout cas en ce qui concerne le discours officiel du FN), mais ce n'est pas ce dont je parlais : je mettais juste, encore une fois, en avant le fait que Philippot nie cette formulation, à 18 minutes 30 [ici](http://www.wat.tv/video/replay-l-ecoute-juin-2014-6t889_2exyh_.html).",0,1402311867,null,0,1402312818,0,ci2vp1m,t3_27mq28,t1_ci2vp1m,t1_ci2vfax,null,1434158178,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

&gt;___Jiro Dreams of Sushi___ is a 2011 American documentary film directed by David Gelb.  The film follows Jiro Ono (小野 二郎, *Ono Jirō* ?), an 85-year-old sushi master and owner of [Sukiyabashi Jiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukiyabashi_Jiro), a [Michelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin_Guide) three-star restaurant, on his continuing quest to perfect the art of [sushi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushi). The film also profiles Jiro's two sons, both of whom are also sushi chefs. The younger son, Takashi (隆士), left Sukiyabashi Jiro to open a mirror image of his father's restaurant in [Roppongi Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roppongi_Hills). The 50-year-old elder son, Yoshikazu (禎一), obligated to succeed his father, still works for Jiro and is faced with the prospect of one day taking over the [flagship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship) restaurant.

EDIT: Rumors dicono che Valve e Nintendo hanno annunci importanti da fare, Mirror's Edge potrebbe portare un trailer e/o un demo, Sony potrebbe annunciare i primi titoli per Project Morpheus, c'é attesa per Halo 5 e probabilmente un nuovo Battlefield.

In general, I haven't met many Turks that I didn't like just because they were Turks but because they were a bunch of twats making the fact that they are Turks part of them being twats. I had some people in class who asked me if I knew some of those Nazis. What are those Nazis, you might ask. Well, he said ""those people that always look at you when you hang out. We usually beat those up"". Of course the ""German potato"" thing comes up and general disrespect or however you want to call it against Germans because they are German.

They make the fact that they're Turks a big deal and built their generally cunty behaviour on top of their cultural heritage. But they're not cunts because they're Turks.

That obviously leaves a bad taste and I think some people can't make a difference between the cuntyness those people (I know that this is a kind of loaded term in some Anglophone countries but I can't find a better way to express that in English. No racism intended) show and their heritage. That is something we have to work on.

I made the comparison in another thread about Muslims in France. You've got some radical Muslims coming over, people get mad and think all Muslims are radical (which is something the French in that particular case have to work on), then ordinary people that happen to be Muslims come over and get put into the same category as the radicals which makes them in return mad and maybe even radical because the radical Muslims are the only one that provide some sense of community.

The Neo-Nazis do the same here.

Then you've got those Turks that demands stuff like Islam classes taught by Imams or Turkish lessons in school.

For once, the religion classes in my school where ABOUT religion taught by people that have diplomas in theology and not a priest. So why you'd put an Imam into a class room is beyond me.

Then, the Turkish classes. I don't understand why it's exclusively Turkish. Make classes for every minority language. There are Turks and Russians and Greeks and in my city some Japanese people as well that would like to have those classes. This should be a general thing every minority should get and not just the Turks. This sort of arrogance apparently justified by number makes me mad. Put the Greeks and Italians together and you outnumber the Turks in my city.

There is shit happening on both sites. Right now, it seems like the Turks are trying to push a certain agenda and the Germans just ignore that even though it's only one part of either site that is like that. We should all together try to make it better for all minorities. Not just the Turks. Yes, there are many of them but there's a reason why we protect minorities and their languages in the EU and why France got shit for their one-language-policy.

It's not only about the Turks and making it an exclusively Turkish problem is arrogant.",0,1402313240,null,0,false,0,ci2vyf6,t3_27oa58,t1_ci2vyf6,t3_27oa58,null,1434158300,12,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,12

Administrative divisions are very different between Denmark and Sweden. The official City of Copenhagen has a population around half a million people, but only covers the central 10 or so urban districts where urban development has been close to impossible for well near a century — there simply isn't room. Stockholm in comparison has a population of about 2.1 million, but that's referring to Stockholms Län (i.e., County of Stockholm) rather than city proper.

A better comparison in terms of urban development and continuous urban sprawl is between Stockholms Län and Storkøbenhavn (Greater Copenhagen), which covers a similar area, and has a population of about 2.4 million. Some would even include Malmö and other parts of Skåne since the opening of the Øresund Bridge in 2000, which sparked massive urban development and integration between the cities. Today, many cross the bridge regularly for work and leisure on both sides, resulting in a continuous urban development zone encompassing around 3.5 million people (with the exceedingly fluffy definition that it would be reasonable to look for employment anywhere within the zone).

In the end it really comes down to fairly arbitrary administrative divisions, but there are some interesting cultural dynamics at play — for instance, Copenhagen does not have any competitors in terms of urban life within Denmark, at least not in the way that Gothenburg is kinda-sorta a contender versus Stockholm, so this means that about half the population of Denmark resides in or around Copenhagen, while fringe regions are getting depopulated.

Cameron has offered full control over income tax - which is, by the way, miles from what most would consider as DevoMax - but immediately there were people in the Conservative party coming out in opposition to the, what many consider as modest, proposals. When Labour laid out their proposals for further devolution, even more modest than the Conservative proposal, it also split the party. DevoNano, people refer to it. Not so much DevoMax. 

Of course, it's all a bit misleading. We don't know how it will affect the Barnett formula, how it will affect other taxation, and so on. Scotland already controls some income tax but can't actually raise any money by tweaking rates. Raising the rates at the moment just results in the Barmett formula being reduced; why would the Parliament take an unpopular tax move for no increase in revenue? They wouldn't, of course.

true,inthenameofmine,null,null,"It's a bit different. From a sociological perspective all old parties are essentially tribal parties. ""Tribe"" being a very loose word for explaining the Sicilian-style large family. The only places where they get significant votes is wherever they have family members, which is most often in their home regions. Once this is even more so in villages where the village people vote based on family ties. Once people move to the cities they tend to have smaller families and face modern problems such as worker rights, no access to credit lines (15% average interest rate here), corruption issues, high rent, etc. Village people don't face these modern problems, the only thing they care about is family. Added to this the people are movibg slower than usual for such a country to cities because almist every village family has somebody in Germany/Switzerland/UK/US who sends 100-300 euros a month in remittances. This is just enough for them to survive and not face reality (30-40% unemployment).

That said. Vetevendosje is not a tribal party, in fact it has no sttonghold and it is the *only* party which got votes in every village and city. Not even the PDK did that.

As a result every city has a tribal/family party which gets 30-50% of the votes and vetevendosje is either 2nd or 3rd in almost all cities. In Prishtina it's just second after LDK which is the local tribal/family party (though loosing all the time to vetevendosje due to demographic change).

C'è un selfpost che incredibilmente pare sia puro da cazzate

http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/27dzrm/men_are_not_happy/

quando dice:

&gt;The Red Pill is here because men aren’t happy. They don’t want to be sweet and sensitive and do things for women all day long and be the “perfect boyfriend,” while having subpar sex once every six weeks, paying out the ass for expensive dates and gifts, sacrificing personal time, and getting bitched at and threatened with a break-up if any of this perfect behavior ever dips slightly. They don’t want to give backrubs and footrubs, stay at home one weekend a month while their women have a night out with the girls, get disrespected and talked about behind their backs, get cheated on (but just harmless, meaningless mistakes that don’t really count!), and get berated when they push back against any of this. They don’t want to let women move in, rent-free, and get pressured to buy a ring for a four-digit number of dollars and tie their finances to someone who makes less than half as much money, just because they’ve been “dating awhile” and “it’s time” and they’re “supposed to.”

sta dicendo: uomini, non fate i cazzo di zerbini. Va bene essere gentiluomini, ma solo quando la donna lo merita davvero.

quando dice:

&gt;Guys in the “my man went Red Pill and ruined our relationship” Reddit posts probably aren’t actually going to internet sites to get an instruction manual for how to piss off their girlfriends. They’re just normal guys who know in the pit of their stomach that something is wrong – that they’re wasting their lives, and that they’re not happy. **It’s not their girlfriends’ fault, it’s theirs. And they decide one day, for whatever reason, to try to take control of their lives, of their relationships, and build something they’re actually proud of.**

sta dicendo: se siete infelici in una relazione, non è detto che sia colpa del partner, può essere che sia colpa vostra, che non riuscite a capire che non siete felici in questa relazione. Abbiate amor proprio o di aggiustare la vostra relazione, oppure di abbandonarla.

Io, nella mia precedente relazione, mi trovavo in una situazione abbastanza morbosa, dove non riuscivo ad essere felice, cercavo di cambiarmi sempre di più per venire incontro a lei ma per lei non era mai abbastanza. Avessi letto prima queste pillole, avrei forse raggiunto la consapevolezza della mia infelicità, e avrei avuto le palle di lasciarla senza sentirmi in colpa. Invece ho aspettato che si rompesse le palle lei, sprecando un sacco di tempo. La colpa non era di nessuno, semplicemente non stavamo bene insieme. Ma invece di pensare ""eh, io sono l'uomo, devo adeguarmi"" avrei dovuto pensare ""cazzo, anche io ho diritto ad essere felice, e non sono disposto a farmi cancellare così"".

Ora sono in una relazione equilibrata, ma ho dovuto imparare tutte queste cose nel maniera più dura. Riesco ad avere una visione illuminata di TRP semplicemente perché: 1 non sono un misogino, adoro le donne e voglio che le persone non siano giudicate in base ad attributi quali il sesso ma in base alla loro individualità 2 trovo conferme al pensiero che la mia esperienza mi detta, ovvero che un uomo zerbino è un uomo infelice.

Another example of this ignorance towards culture, one of my best childhood friends was a turkish girl, she got married of to some old fart and killed him and herself. Something i learned way later from her big sister.

Tell me why should i respect such acts, why should i respect any culture that enables such?

Wow, that's horrible. I can't relate to that at all so I guess shouldn't merrily judge your anger.


But I still think my point stands: if society discards whole national group based on demented practices of small part (I assume) of it then it is not only not protesting against acts like that but makes those those practices more common since wrongfully accused minority is far more likely to radicalise.

On the other hand embracing said nationality (or religious group, or culture, or w/e it is in other examples like that) while specifically condemning and fighting those very behaviours is an effective way of rooting those atrocities out.

WTO, as such 'sanctions' would be breaking the rules and the treaties Russia has ratified.

&gt; I understand a lot of people are scared because of Crimea but I'm skeptical of how beneficial a NATO membership would really be.

I understand some people may be scared of unlikely Russian trade sanctions but I see NATO membership as the better choise for Finland in the long term. It is very unlikely there would be an EU defence alliance as the WEU which was touted as such in the 90s is gone, it is also unlikely there would be a defence alliance between Sweden and Finland (BTW, for some reason Russia opposes this too). Therefore NATO is and will be the de facto defence alliance in the EU, and I'd rather have Finland as a part of that.

Russia has started to think, talk, and act in an outdated imperial 'sphere of influence' mode. Despite that being so past century Russia actually believes it has a right to have a 'sphere of influence' subverting the sovereignity of its neighbouring countries.

It is rather obvious that their mid-to-long term objective is to have Finland in that position once again. I for one do not wish Finlandization back. Despite the rather weak threats voiced by some Russians I am not the slightest afraid of an actual Russian invasion. What I am concerned about is Russia's 'sphere of influence' idea, and how that would play out regarding Finland on the long term. 

I'd much rather join NATO than have Finlandization and 'Kekkosslovakia' back.

The fact is that the government was not asking countries to give their opinions on the issue. They were asking governments to 'back them' and not support it.

&gt; The fact is that the government was not asking countries to give their opinions on the issue. They were asking governments to 'back them' and not support it.

That does not mean that the American government believes independence would be bad for scotland or any other arguments and reasoning. No this is just America backing it's ally.

Basicly what you are saying is that if they dont agree with what you say, then they shouldnt say anything.

There is a difference. 'Could you weigh in on the referedum?' vs 'Could you tell people that the referendum is a bad idea' And basically, no that's not what I'm saying. I would be happy for a country to say that they don't support the independence (though I don't see why they would) if they did so without pressure from the UK government.

&gt;So when someone is asked a question, suddenly the answer they give is not their answer?

They weren't asked a question of 'do you support or not support the referdum' They weren't asked that. And my reasons don't count as reasons since you disagree with them? hmm...

&gt;What is bad about America backing its ally? NOTHING. Because its a legitimate reason and its quite clear that you cant handle other people having an opinion which differs from your own.

The bad thing about them saying disagreeing with the referendum purely because their ally would get the brunt deal, is that people don't know this is the reason.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Are you saying that national and regional politics have no influence on the economy when there is low corruption?


Hmm, that's to a broad extend in economics because it's arbitrary on a bigger level: how much do you want centralised/decentralised, unitarism/regionalisation, government administration, local administration etc.; then, everything depends mainly on individuals alone as of how far long the rest of the population allows them to go. Since I'm not italian, I can't really answer that question directly, on Italy's status. 



However, as a less tight opinion to that question, normally, things go better as long as politics and bussinesses go on different paths, as long as the governments let it go that way. It's also better if the representatives, both from governments and bussinesses, have very little (formal meetings at best) to no interaction between themselves.


The only time national politics (I don't think any country gives equal power of decision at regional level; maybe federalist ones but I see it too risky) has any kind of influence on the economy is when individuals apply to receive credits in order to open/make a business.
As for corruption, again, it depends how far long the public lets the government officials stretch.

As a double measure, there are/were cases where political corruption was low but, at corporate level, there are/were high. 


&gt;I couldn't tell really. Everything considered, I'd say that on a national level we're pretty natural. Keep in mind that Italy is almost equally split between people espousing right wing politics and people espousing left wing, with all the baggage that comes with this.


Countries like these spark a lot of self-atavic hatred amongst civilians. Because of these splits, you see many small regions aiming at independence; Italy's case being Venetian separatism.

* The air is actually breathable, unlike Rome;

Cons:

par Anne Lauvergeon, alors présidente d’Areva. **Mais ceux qui sont censés en bénéficier se trouvent aussi
lésés, car ils sont toujours soupçonnés d’être là où ils sont par la grâce d’une discrimination.**

&gt;Tu n'interprètes pas ça comme une volonté de défense des hommes blancs hétérosexuels contre un ""racisme inversé"" ? 

Non.

&gt;C'est quoi alors ? Explique-moi s'il te plaît.

C'est une opposition à la discrimination positive, comme le montre le titre du paragraphe : ""Le retour de l’égalité contre la discrimination positive"".

&gt;Je réécris ta phrase en y réintégrant mes propos, que ton ""cela"" évoque : ""Philippot ne nie pas [que son programme mentionne explicitement la défense des hommes blancs hétérosexuels],

Tu déformes complètement mes propos ou tu n'as pas compris. Cite les mot pour mot. Mon premier commentaire disait juste ""le FN ne propose pas de défendre les hommes blancs plus que les autres Français.""

Tu dis que Philippot nie que le programme mentionne des HBH, il ne nie pas cela. Il nie que le programme **défend** les HBH. J'ai cité les phrases de Philippot.

Tu as dit ""Il parle d'un fait précis. Il dit que le Front National **cite**, dans un de ses programmes, les ""hommes blancs hétérosexuels"", rien de plus.""

C'est faux. Thomas Guénolé dit que le FN **défend** les HBH. Ce qui est faux. Philippot a donc raison de le contredire là-dessus.

Tu confonds ""citer"" et ""défendre"", c'est cela que je m'efforce de te faire comprendre.

Some more info here: http://iisr.ru/news49.html (Google translate is your friend if you don't know Russian).

&gt; Trying to blame this whole conflict on anyone but Russia is plain stupid.

European Union tried to push Yanukovich to that economical agreement that would have those consequences:

(a) opening Ukrainian market for superior EU-made goods, thus indirectly economically attacking Russian market (Ukraine and Russia had essentially free trade agreements, so Russia would be forced to either put severe restrictions on trade with Ukraine or to suck it up and suffer economically);

(b) ditching Eastern Ukrainian industry which is still important for Russia (especially Russian military) but have no use for EU;

(c) refusing to prolong Sevastopol agreement by 2017, forcing Russian Navy out to strategically and logistically inferior Novorossiysk and finishing this apparently unnoticed Ukrainian land grab. (Sevastopol was not a part of Ukraine even after Crimea was given to Ukraine; Sevastopol was City of State Importance and answered directly to Moscow; in 1994 Sevastopol made last attempt to remain in Russia but failed.)

I'm not even talking about events that followed.

They probably wouldnt support Scottish independence if it made the UK as a whole, less powerful. Which it would. And having a less powerful ally is not in anybodies main interest. That is why Obama has said what he said.

&gt; The bad thing about them saying disagreeing with the referendum purely because their ally would get the brunt deal, is that people don't know this is the reason. Some people legitimately believe that countries who take a stance on something do so because they weigh the pros and cons for those who would be most effected (scottish people).

&gt;

&gt;Visočica is a hill overlooking the town of Visoko. In October 2005, Bosnian native and author [Semir Osmanagić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semir_Osmanagi%C4%87) claimed that this hill and several surrounding hills concealed [pyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid). 

&gt;Scientific investigations of the site show there is no pyramid.    Additionally, scientists have criticised the Bosnian authorities for supporting the pyramid claim saying, ""This scheme is a cruel hoax on an unsuspecting public and has no place in the world of genuine science."" 

&gt;Bosnian archaeologists have asked that the government cancel the digging permits given to Osmanagić and concentrate on work on the medieval town.

What I'm getting at is that it's also their prerrogative. I believe the people should be able to choose what to do with the folklore and the languages (which are for the most part no longer useful in an increasingly modernised world), and just as what happened during franquismo was horrible and hopefully never to be repeated, I also consider it a bit absurd for the government to try and force it down everyone's throats (having Euskera be worth more points than literally everything else that speaks to your expertise and competency for public opositions, for instance) when half of Bilbao doesn't speak it (and i'm talking natives, don't get me started on how this affects migratory issues), not to mention the whole euskaltegi corruption/nonsensical business.

But then it can get to absurd situations like having people ignore/scoff at you when you try to ask them something in Spanish, in motherfucking Barcelona (aka; a city whose economy is heavily based on tourism).

http://iisr.ru/news49.html

«„Вы за воссоздание Крымской Автономной Советской Социалистической республики как субъекта Союза ССР и участника Союзного договора?” положительно ответили 1 343 855 человек (93,26 %).»

Crimean voted for restoring Crimean ASSR (Autonomous Soviet Socialistic Republic) as an equal member of USSR. 

After that vote for independence of Ukraine: 

«1 декабря 1991 года на Украине проводился референдум с вопросом: „Подтверждаете ли Вы Акт провозглашения независимости Украины?”. Жители Украины ответили: „Да” — 90,32 % из 84,18 % принявших участие в голосовании.»

People of mainland Ukraine voted massively for independence.

«В Крыму в референдуме приняли участие 62 % от граждан, внесённых в списки. За Акт провозглашения независимости Украины проголосовали 54 %, с учетом принявших участие в голосовании отдыхающих и курортников, многочисленных военнослужащих. Две третьих крымских избирателей (973.653 человек) либо голосовали «против», либо участие в референдуме не принимали.»

2/3 of Crimean people either voted against independence of Ukraine or didn't voted at all.

According to the laws of USSR (that still existed during that time) an SSR can exit USSR if people decide so, **but** if there are autonomous republics or regions in that SSR then separate referendum must be done for those republics or regions. That was not done.

Finally, Sevastopol.

«26 июня 1994 года был проведен всеобщий опрос и в Севастополе о статусе города. 90 % населения города высказалось за российский статус города.»

In 1994 people of Sevastopol decided that it should remain in Russia.

It's silly how some are suddenly trying to reduce him as merely a random person without influence. That's obvioulsy not true.

If you look at other metro/subway systems around the world, the stations are usually unique in some way, just a slightly different wall decoration or something can really add to the look. But the Copenhagen metro is just grey, with a bit of grey floors, and some surprisingly grey walls, with off-white trains, and some grey tracks. I'm not the type to pain graffiti, but I can really get behind the mindset of something thinking ""By god this shit needs some color"".

Can't be that hard for Metro to get in contact with someone who can paint, get them to paint one wall of plywood, put it up for some time, paint it white, get someone to paint something new.

true,MrMysterious95,EURO,Proud European,"Being intelligent is overrated. Technically, intelligence is defined as ""ability to solve problems"", but quite often in practice IQ is what IQ tests measure. While Mikke, being a professional bridge player, a reasonably well educated person who meets other representatives elites (journalists, politicians, administrators) on daily basis, can be described as ""intelligent"", this does not actually mean ""smart"", ""useful"", or ""nice"".

I define myself as a social democrat, but I can occasionally talk to a reasonable libertarian (reasonable quite often boils down to 'earns more money than me and wants to pay me some', though). However, it seems that Mikke's followers are far from reasonable.

I wouldn't define Mikke as troll, since he honestly believes every word he says. Yes, he might want to offend people, but people who waste his money on marble palaces for social security, and on sport olympics for retards deserve to be offended. He does not believe in democracy, and he knows that there's no other way for him to gain power, so he plays the game to spread his word, and hey, he finally got into parliament.

Mikke isn't at his core that much different from the right-wing (and, let's be frank SLD and Samoobrona as well) parties that's governed Poland for the past decade, his recent increase of popularity is a result of horribly low level of economic education (Dunnig-Kruger effect rolls in), and yes, the underutilization of funds. If the state doesn't fund proper health and social care, if the private health service trumps the state one, as well as transport, infrastructure (we are privatising power plants, for Flying Spaghetti Monster's sake!), it's natural that people raised in such a system will prefer laissez-faire, especially if they don't fully understand nature of democracy.

Is Mikke going to destroy European Union? Sadly, no. He will get into Polish parliament next year and quite likely gain a couple of mandates. PiS will most likely win the election, and if SLD will reject the coalition, PSL and KNP might be the most likely partner. He has a slim chance to become the next Vice-Prime Minister; but in all the previous elections he had an ever smaller chance to get into Parliament, so he and his cronies will jump the Europarliament. 

So, what will Mikke do? Probably be another Farage, deliver stupid speeches whenever possible, vote literally against everything including any budgeting project, since he's unlikely to get into any comission.

I know this would upset them, so I'm silent about this. He could be as well. No journalist asked about his opinion on the paralympics, he was just telling it and then they started to ask. That's the way I think of him as a troll. I simply don't see any other explanation, because **if he could not emphasize his controversial opinions, he would be in Polish parliament years ago**.

Man kann aber auch ein anderes Verständniss des Begriffs haben, und davon ausgehen, dass ausnahmslos jeder Mensch in einer gewissen Weise religiös ist, und sich dessen entweder bewusst ist oder nicht. Ein solcher Religionsbegriff ist weiter gefasst und beschränkt sich nicht auf religiöse Institutionen, sondern bezieht sich auf ein allgemeines Wesensmerkmal des Menschen. Die Frage ist dann für den Einzelnen, wie diese Religiosität ausgestaltet wird, und nicht, ob sie da ist.

Ein Merkmal von Religion besteht darin, dass sie einen Wert besitzt, der alle weltlichen oder profanen Werte übersteigt. In ihr besteht der eigentliche Sinn des Lebens für den Religiösen. Wer sein Leben dem politischen Kampf verschreibt oder für seine Kunst zu hungern bereit ist, der ist ebenso religiös wie der, der sein Leben in den Dienst Gottes stellt. Es geht also, wenn von Religion die Rede ist, nicht um die Frage nach Göttern oder übernatürlichen Kräften, sondern im Kern um die Frage nach den ""wichtigsten"" Werten einzelner Menschen sowie deren Verhältnisse zur Gestaltung unserer Gesellschaft.

In 2009, Switzerland processed 1,800 claims for asylum from Nigerians.  
Do you know how many were approved?  
1.  
6 received temporary admission.  

The rest were sent home.  

This is a quote from their head of migration:  

""It’s a fact that certain Nigerian asylum seekers mock Swiss naivety and exploit the weaknesses of the asylum process.""

""For me it’s clear: our country is too attractive as an asylum destination for applicants who abuse the system. Switzerland gives them too much time to do their dodgy business.""

He says the main reason for this is that during their interviews most Nigerians tell the same “stereotypical and unbelievable” story and not the truth and “People from aid agencies who are present at the interviews come to the same conclusions,”. 

So if legitimate asylum seekers are wondering why the process takes so long, the blame partly lies with those who are trying to take advantage of the system.

 - claim something so outrageous that people hung up and don't know how to respond, because there's not enough time to explain from basics what's wrong. Classic reaction is ""Where should I start.."". It works the best on experts, because they overestimate how much regular people know about their subjects - they think people see what Korwin is doing, and people see that expert can't respond to their idol. Example - ""Korwin-Mikke against global warming industry"", ""women shouldn't have voting rights"", ""disabled people shouldn't be shown competing on TV"", etc, etc.

 - hold on to minor details during conversation (""tak czy nie?"") - make your opponent look stupid be forcing him to seemingly contradict himself. This is very easy because people use shortcuts when communicating. The basic definitions are shared among people and shortcuts allow them to talk quicker. Shared definitions makes discussion even possible. Korwin will ask people something simple, and when they answer with something that's defined in a subtle way he will take it at face value and show how it contradicts some previous thing that person said. No extreme inteligence required - you just need to be a cynic jerk.

For example he will show that democracy is bad and autocracy is better, because:

 - democracy is a tyrany of majority (almost all modern democracies have safeguards against that so he's using different definition of democracy, and anyway autocracy is a tyranny of minority so even worse)
 - voting is bad because you can't decide value of pi by voting (so what - you can't decide value of pi by king decision either, and besides governing is different than doing science)
 - some bad decisions were made by voting (so what - you should look at statistics and compare with other government forms and not look at single events).

He will ask someone if democracy is good, then ask if Hitler was evil, then show that Hitler was elected (not exactly true, but close enough). How extremely intelligent :/

Je me demande en ce moment - en tout cas je trouve l'hypothèse intéressante - si mon parcours scolaire assez classique (collège, lycée, université), si l'Education Nationale et l'Enseignement supérieur, n'ont pas un rôle là-dedans.

Il y a une grosse littérature en ce moment qui accuse le libéralisme de tous les maux (cf. Jean-Claude Michéa, etc.), mais je trouve ça incroyable que des gouvernements successifs qui laissent 60 % du PIB être consacré aux dépenses publiques puissent être accusés d'ultralibéralisme. Il n'y a selon moi aucun parti libéral en France.

It used to happen **a lot** in the 90s or even 00s, it still is, but not to the same degree. To be fair, as shitty as the titles are, it's justified. Sometimes a movie title could be a reference to the american culture (something well-known in the states) or it could be completely impossible to translate to Greek, so we just give the movie a title that would be more appealing to the Greek audience.

This doesn't always happen. For instance, movie titles like the X-men, Avatar, The Wolverine, Inception, Seven, Underworld etc etc remain exactly the same.

Also, now that the TV channels know how many young people use the internet to visit english-speaking forums to talk about movies/tv-shows and whatnot, they mostly use the original tv-show title to advertize its broadcast.

There is a reason why in all small countries with their own languages, stuff on TV generally isn't dubbed (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Greece, the Netherlands, Slovenia), and it's population size. Which made the population more fluent afterwards and they act like it's been like this all along and that's why it was somehow decided that dubbing wouldn't be used in their country.

Anyway, some British lad took over the factory and all men were asked to come to the factory if they could. No one was forced to work there but since the Brits had just liberated us it was pretty much implied that you went if you could. At least that is how my grandfather puts it.

My grandfather said that 'within days' the British had hundreds of trucks going to and coming from the factory almost 24/7. He met a lot of British and American soldiers at the time who would distribute the cement from Maastricht to all over the allied zone. They would always trade chocolate for beers my grandfather found somewhere. (Dutch euphemism for: stole the beers).

Wow.  Really?  Here is a secret, we're human beings and do the same things other human beings do including marrying non-muslims and non-Turks.

The sad truth about Europe is that ""modern"" Turks are not seen as Turks.  If a European person saw a Turkish couple was at a beach in Spain where the woman was topless, that couple would never be considered ""Turkish"".

What you probably don't realize is that you come across/interact with many Turks in your life and don't even realize that they are Turkish.

Why not put a day or two more there in Madrid, and then you can go to Segovia or maybe Salamanca (or even a trip to El Escorial, or you could spend a day hiking the mountains). Valencia I do think is alot to do in just a day. For Granada If you want to go to the Alhambra, you normally have to get there very early in the morning or stay at a hotel or hostel there which will sell the tickets. Plus, it has a much better night life I think than Cordoba. A town I really like by Granada is Salobreña, being 6,000 years old, on the beach and having a wonderful castle... maybe not the same recognition as Ronda, but I like it more. San Sebastian is very cool city, though I do not know that well. I've traveled around parts of Spain (much of andalucia) with people not speaking spanish. Its tough!

true,whatelsecanyoudo1,null,null,"This is not just a problem for working-class immigrants and their descendants (you can research the *Gastarbeiter* program yourself).

I was born and raised in Germany. My grandparents were immigrants from Iran. Both of my parents were born and raised in Germany. There native German speakers like myself. I have never been to Iran nor do I speak the national language (Persian). My grandparents, parents and I are atheist. My family speaks only German. Like most of the Iranian diaspora, we are highly educated and financially secure so the reasons people left the old country were purely political, not financial. Nearly everyone in my is a doctor or has a PhD in engineering. In fact, I’m about to get my PhD in Computer Science; I have two siblings who are in medical schools right now. In addition to my native German, I speak four additional foreign languages fluently; I’m working on languages five and six. I’m from one of the wealthiest parts of one of the major cities in Germany where there were no other minorities. 

And all of my life, German society has made every effort to shit on me and my family. 

People on the streets would call us ‘Scheiss Ausländer’ (foreigner) all the time. We would get physically attacked countless times. Ever since I attended elementary school, I was called a ‘piece of shit foreigner’ over all these years. I was repeatedly told by both classmates and teachers to fuck off to wherever I came from. People would ask me if could wash myself clean so my eye color would become blue.

Do you know how hard it is to find an apartment when nobody wants to rent it out to a ‘foreigner’? I would ask an ethnic German friend to inquire about the same apartment that I couldn't get since it was unavailable and voila it was available for him. Many people didn't even hesitate to tell me they won’t rent out to foreigners. My dad offered to buy me an apartment so I wouldn't have to deal with racism when apartment hunting. It is the same when finding an internship/job. How am I supposed to feel German when people don’t greet or service me when buying new clothes or they do so reluctantly, staring me down, as if I owed them? Even when going to a doctor’s appointment people tell me ‘so you’re probably from one of those countries’. When meeting new people, some people start speaking English to me. Once I start speaking German, they reply in English. I tell them WTF and they keep going. Other people ‘compliment’ me on my German skills, thinking I just jumped the border or something. Sometimes I get asked if I’m a refugee. People only care about your ethnicity, what you look like and nothing else. You could be an unemployed former dishwasher as long as you’re an ethnic German you will be granted a greater social standing than a successful immigrant. Unfortunately, I have learned that this is a core belief of the majority of people in this society, and not merely a fringe phenomenon amongst lowlife skinheads covered in swastika tattoos. If you try to talk to people about it they will either ignore you, say that you’re lying or start ranting about how much minorities suck. Of course, politicians won’t hesitate to use race baiting and accusing minorities of all the evils in the world to garner votes. So where does this all end?

I travel a lot, you know. I've had the chance to meet with people in other developed countries inside and outside Europe, including Canada, and so far, people in Germany have proven to be the most aggressive and vile. I feel as an outsider here than in other countries. My siblings and I have made a decision to leave for Canada once we've finished our education. People over there are extremely nice, tolerant and welcoming. I’m sure there are many people here who will rejoice since they've accomplished what they wanted all along: to rid their country of minorities.

true,RECTANGULAR_BALLSACK,SWED,Sweden,"True, there have been no ""consortium"", but there's a general consensus among the Scandinavian population to use English as the primary second language, and not to dub *any* foreign films. Here's why:

1. Scandinavian languages are closely related to English, which is why it is fairly simple and logical for us to adopt and choose English as a second language. That's the single biggest reason why we tend to place in the top of English language skills, not the fact that we don't dub movies. 

2. Your theory starts falling apart once you find out that some smaller countries do in fact dub foreign movies and TV series -- like Hungary, apparently. I also think you're severely overestimating the cost of dubbing; it's not *that* expensive, and it's not like Sweden--or the other Scandinavian countries--lacks the resources needed to do that. 

3. As a matter of fact, when things have been dubbed over here, people have complained about it -- a lot. That's why we generally don't do that, and that's why it's limited to children's movies and shows. We actually prefer hearing the real voices, when given a choice!

In the case of the Basque Country, it has much to do with identity. Many Basques, me included, do not feel Spanish. We don't identify with the idea of Spain, with what being a Spaniard means. We have our very own culture (traditions, languages, landscapes and architecture different to Spain's). We've been ruled by our own laws (the Basque fueros or foru) for centuries and we have fiercely resisted invasors (the Celts, the Romans, the Visigoths, the Arabs) and have managed to keep our own language and culture alive for over a millennium. 

It's been proved to us during the last century that Spain is incompatible with our idea of preserving our culture. Why? Because they don't care about it, and why should they? It isn't their own. The Francoist dictatorship tried to kill our language and destroy our culture (a process called ""Spanish-ation"", *españolización*), and even now in ""democracy"" they still try to undermine it. 

We configure a nation of our own, recognized (by everyone except the Spaniards) as such, and we deserve, **at least**, to be able to **choose** whether we want to be independent or not. That's democracy. Choosing our own future. The Basque people *want* to choose. That's what the human chain was all about.

In Euskadi, it has stopped retreating in two regions and it is actually growing in a third. Not long ago, it was revealed that at least 50% of Bilbao's (biggest city) population now were Basque speakers, in the countryside the levels are much higher, in many areas above 90%.

Now, you can hear, every now and then, children and teenagers speaking in Basque in the streets of the capital. Something that just 30 years ago was completely impossible. The new generations have gone to Basque school and are now Basque speakers, even if their parents are not.  

The situation is dire in Iparralde (France) though. The elderly population are all Basque speakers, but the problem is many are not passing the language to the new generations.

In the long term is alleviates a whole host of problems that come with being a developed country; Population shrinkage being a big one. These immigrants will have families, their children will grow up in our education system and provide skilled labour. Or if some of them don't, they'll provide unskilled labour with the millions of other unskilled European labourers.

On top of this, this is as much a humanitarian issue as it is an economic one. Even more so, really. Denial of asylum is a violation of human rights. Repatriation of illegals? Not so much, but if you ship illegals back - which will be a costly endeavor in of itself - they'll be stranded, absolutely destitute and will more than likely try and find a way back here or simply die or end up in jail or turning to crime wherever we dump them.

This is nothing more than another wave of mass immigration that Europe has been under for a long, long, **long** time, long before Europe's internal open borders policy was even a thing. And we're still going strong. So it is sustainable.

The only non-sustainable policy here is the unfair division of load. The Southern states are not going to be able to handle the problem on their own, and what's happening right now is that according to international law, asylum seekers(etc.) must be handled in the country they first end up in.

Well here you fall for a very old stereotype. In the polyglot scene we find it actually funny because when we talk to older people about learning a language, up to today, they seem, like you, to think this would be ""common knowledge"". Actual studies actually show that children learn languages a bit more easily but the difference is not as huge as that learning a language would become a lot more difficult. Mostly adults fail because they don't know how and rather focus on the how instead of just doing it. A child won't ask you why ""bread"" is called ""bread"" or why it is ""He is"" and not ""He are"", adults will ask these questions and this is the biggest reason for making it seem hard.",0,1402339340,null,0,false,0,ci36c8e,t3_27og0b,t1_ci36c8e,t1_ci2zll1,null,1434163353,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Oui, les américains sont venus défendre leurs intérêts : on entreprend pas une guerre **contre** ses intérêts. Mais l'idée que logique d'intérêt soit purement mercantiliste pour la 2nde guerre mondiale est complétement fausse. C'était l'un des facteurs de décision importants durant la première guerre mondiale à cause de la guerre sous-marine totale allemande et des prêts consentis aux alliés, pas du tout pour la seconde.

* déjà, il y a le léger détail que les allemands ont déclaré la guerre aux américains après pearl harbor. La perspective de laisser une nation belliciste avec qui vous êtes en guerre devenir la super puissance d'europe continentale est un facteur plus motivant pour faire la guerre à l'allemagne que de faire du commerce. Si ce n'était pas le cas, pourquoi ne pas faire du commerce avec les nazis ?

* ensuite, si la logique commerciale était si importante, pourquoi les américains ont-ils signé l'accord prêt-bail en mars 1941 qui en tout état de cause est un ***don*** de matériel militaire aux alliés.

* l'idée que les américains sont entrés en guerre au côté de la russie communiste pour défendre leur intérêt commercial prête aussi à sourire. Et ne me dis pas que c'est pour vendre des armes, le royaume-uni étant au bord de la banqueroute (pour ça qu'ils les ont donné ces armes).

Les américains sont rentrés en guerre pour des raisons de géo-stratégie, pas des raisons commerciales. **L'une des fonctions principales de la géopolitique est d'empêcher l'émergence de puissances hostiles qui pourraient se révéler une menace existentielle.** Un empire japonais sur tout l'asie du sud-est et un troisième reich dominant toute l'Europe répondaient à cette description et les états-unis ont agi pour détruire ces deux empires avant qu'ils ne puissent se consolider.

Second, what is this demand or wish to be applauded and thanked? Do normal citizens get a thank you letter for paying taxes? No, you do your job, pay your taxes and gp on about your life. Looking for pats on the back or validation comes from your own successes, not praise for completing base obligations, and to think otherwise is pandering for attention and special treatment, so get over it.

And that she found a few accepting friends at a college in the U.S., while villifying all Germans as unaccepting is both ludicrous and completely unexemplifying of the U.S. Middle Easterners and those of Arab look are, right now, the most disliked and looked-down-upon group in the U.S., for obvious, though almost entirely unjustified reasons. As well as hispanics, again out of mostly ignorance because they are some of the hardest labor working demographic of the U.S., meanwhile receiving no benefits if they are there illegally.

Meanwhile, in Germany, I believe the Turkish community has some issues they need to come together and work on before demanding praise and special treatment as model immigrants. The people going around the streets scamming people, almost entirely Turkish. While there are the obnoxiously drunk German football fan youths, the other obnoxious and much more commonly pervasive demographic are too-cool-for-school Turkish youth and 20-somethings just going around with the quasi-gangster lifestyle and throwing trash about and not caring about other social constructs. This is not heinous, but we're talking about what contributes to the public image of the Turkish community. Parents, tell your kids to stop being douchebags. Tell your friends to throw their garbage in the garbage cans, etc.

And if representation is wanted in politics and HR departments, people need to excel and aim for those positions, and some will get them. Just because you have a number of people doesn't mean you get automatic positions. You have to work for it, like everyone else, and harder, because you're an immigrant with something to prove.

Germany has some of the best integration programs in the world. Free extensive language courses! Free job training! They even have programs to accept people from other countries and pay rent and living expenses during the integration courses and job training! The U.S. says, pay me large amounts of money for entry, wait a while, then good luck to ya.

And if, after many years, you still don't speak the language, yes, you deserve to be looked down upon. It's a sign of unappreciation and disrespect to not care about proper communication with those of whom you chose to make your new host country. You chose! Remember this. Germany didn't ask or force you here. I get the language is horrific to learn, but you must, and if you don't, you should be more ashamed than the Germans think of you anyways.

University here is basically free, that's incredible. The only bar to entry is hard work and dedication. If you don't make it, that's on you. In the U.S. there's a vicious cycle of poverty because no one can afford university, and so they stay in low-level jobs forever, no matter how intelligent or hardworking they are. Or they get crushed with debt afterwards that destroys their chance at success. There are just a handful of scholarships, literally, versus EVERYONE getting a free ride. So when the Abitur numbers are that low, it again is an issue with the youth, which is an issue with the parents? The neighborhood, community? Or do you blame the school and teachers? Do parents explain how fantastic the opportunities are here versus Turkey, and that regardless of their ethnic immigratory descent, they can become a doctor on the social structure's dime if they just work hard enough and concentrate and apply themselves? This would cost up to $500,000 in the U.S.! Family doesn't have enough money? BAFUQ! It's incredible and being squandered. Do not tell me Germany isn't doing amazing things for immigrants. Now people want thank yous? For what, doing what is simply expected of everyone else? Grow up.

I am a recent immigrant. I am lucky because I am caucasian. But that doesn't make me any less of a terribly unintegrated foolish immigrant. I am struggling to learn the language and am to be looked down on for this shortcoming, because that's what it is. If I sound stupid, that's my own fault. Luckily, and through hard work and dedication, I have a high-level skill (not from college, because that was too expensive in the U.S.), and so I am able to work and contribute. I would not have come if I didn't think I could be self-reliant. But don't get me wrong, I will always be an immigrant and The American, no matter how accentfrei I could ever speak, and so be it, I just hope to be a better and better representation of myself.

That means absolutely nothing. I dont want to type an essay, but take a look into why US shut down their Shuttle program, which did just that.

&gt;The Topol-M is currently the most advanced ICBM

Thats because no one is designing ICBM, as the missile shield system US is developing shuts them down cold. US has Stealth Bombers which can drop nukes anywhere in Russia, why bother with over-complicated systems.

&gt; their 5th-gen fighter project is certainly more advanced than anything we have in Europe

Sukhoi PAK FA is not in service yet, and only a handful have been built thus far, all prototypes. It gets outclassed by F-35, which Europe will have sooner, and way outclassed by F-22.

&gt;S-400 is arguably the best AA system in the world.

Thats very much debatable, and only applies to mobile AA, which US doesnt build a whole lot of, since there is an Ocean between it, and its closest enemy. In the case of EU, their missile defense systems are static, as they dont play to invade anyone any time soon.

&gt;The Russian market includes many pariah states (like Syria or Venezuela), but they also sell to ""poor countries"" like India and China (that spend more in military than most of the EU) and to ""undeveloped countries"" like South Korea, Greece or Finland.

Yea, pretty accurate, except id put China more into ""Undeveloped"", rather then ""poor"", though they are making progress. Their military is still in very poor shape technologically.

true,Omnilatent,null,null,"This is an everlasting argument about this topic. So here are my two cents as a german who enjoys BOTH to a certain amount.

- Pro dubbing: Nearly everyone in country x will understand everything and won't have to concentrate to understand everything (I think this is a huge pro). Linked to that: Although english is a pretty easy language, you will likely not understand everything. It's not only about language but culture: You might know Shakespear, Voltaire or Goethe in german but if you hear the very same sentences in english you might not recognize it at all.    
I recently read ""The fault in our stars"" by John Green in english and the first two chapters of the german version in a library and I noticed I already missed a lot of information in those two chapters although my english is pretty solid.



- Contra dubbing: So many jokes are lost. There are some shows that are really good at finding ways to ""keep the joke"" in some way but that's definitely not a given for every show. Same goes for play of words (but this is less surprising). 

- Pro dubbing: Some voice actors are amazing. You know Ben from Scrubs (Jordan's little brother)? He was funny in the original but his german voice actor was even better. Almost all animes and cartoons have great voice actors as well. 

- Contra dubbing: Some voice actors can be a horrible choice. My favorite ""worst voice actor choice ever"" is [David Schwimmer of *Friends* in german](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCoNSZV--z0) (aka Kermit the Frog). Another problem is that voice actors might die (german voice of Marge from *The Simpsons* died couple years ago and her successor is okay but not as good as her) or have ""disagreements"" with their studio which can lead to different voice actors for the same character in a (film) series. E.g. Johnny Depp has two ""main"" voice actors in german and the one who dubbed the first three *pirates of the carribean* movies demanded more money for the fourth movie which the studio didn't want to pay so they went with the other. While the other voice is still okay, it bugs the hell out of anyone and the other voice was much more fitting for Cpt. Sparrow.

- Pro dubbing: Subtitles are very cool, however you will take your eyes off the actors/rest of the screen for brief moments which again can make you lose ""much of the actor's performance"".

I like having *the option* of choosing one or another. If I can chose between an english and a german dub for an anime, I can guarantee you the german is hundred times better. I will, however, probably go for the english dub if I want to be ""up to date"" with a series (looking at you GoT) or simply know the german dub is horrible (*cough* Breaking Bad *coughcough*). 

I would really like to see the option for choosing between two or more languages and subtitles for movies and shows in german TV but I don't believe this will be done in the next 10 years.",0,1402342828,null,0,false,0,ci383us,t3_27oxbk,t1_ci383us,t1_ci30pjd,null,1434164250,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Because things like debating culture, social consensus etc play a heavy role.

For example peoples initiative. For a long, long time this was not actually used to enact a new law, since most of them were turned down at the ballot. No, it was a means to start a debate in the parliaments, trigger reforms, find a way to *respect* the minorities wishes and balance it with the wishes of the majority. Now, what does a foreigner see? Possibly: *Great, finally a way to show these dumb politicians what the people really wants* or just another way to suppress minorities. And it was exactly the opposite, until the rise of the peoples party and their seriously destructive behaviour. Mind you, not because they are right-wingers, but because they shit on the way politics was done in Switzerland for over a century, with terrible consequences for the society in Switzerland.

I stayed there with a German family in the heart of Dusseldorp (Düsseldorf), a city five times the size of the city I live in myself. The German guy, Peter, wanted to visit friends of his, some of whom also had a Dutchie with them. We went there using the S-track (or U-track, I always confuse the two), and when we arrived we had to walk for a short while.

We were crossing the Rijn (Rhein), and we while we were walking there, a woman was just coming from the other side, pushing a buggy. I was looking at her child. It was playing with some toy. And right before we passed, I looked up and noticed the woman was looking at us. I smiled and said ""Goedendag"" in my best German as I passed. 

We arrived at his friend's place, and everybody was already waiting for us. I started chatting with the other Dutchies, wondering if they knew what the Germans were up to. Two of them went to a supermarket, and returned proudly holding a box of orange juice, like if it were a trophy.

We walked over to a nearby playground, with a swing and some other stuff. It then became apparant why they were so happy with the orange juice. He took a bottle of wodka out of his bag, threw a part of the orange juice away, and re-filled it with wodka.

I was used to playing games like werewolves of Miller's Hollow (Werwölfe vond Düsterwald) when passing time with my friends, so I was a bit bored to sit there for hours while they were drinking the wodka, sitting on a swing. But it was nice to see what our easter neighbours are doing, and that's after all why I took part in the exchange program in the first place.

After a couple of hours, it was getting dark, and we decided it would be better to return home. We told the others goodbye, and Peter and I went back to the S-track. He wasn't really saying anything, and he was a bit tipsy. Until we reached the bridge again. He asked me what it was all about with that woman.

I asked what he was talking about. He asked me why I greeted that woman with the buggy. Did I knew her? No, I told him. I had never met a Düsseldorfer before, apart from the ones in the exchange program. Then why, he asked, did I greet her? She was Turkish. They are different people.
