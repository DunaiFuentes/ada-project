You can't devalue it.

Eurozone made an exception for Greece because they thought Greece would straighten themselves and work for their membership but the opposite happend.

If Greece still had drachma they could just devalue it and voala, problem solved. You basically chain yourself together with a common currency like the euro, however spaning the euro too far often leads to implications because of culture and so on.

&gt; These countries knew they didn't have the ability to devalue any more.

Greece counts on other countries to help them out, but they basically do nothing themselves. They had the opportunity to make life a little easier by just owning one house etc but they opted out, and thus comes the consequences.

&gt; If they continued policies that would lead to them having to devalue at some, it is their fault.

It is Greece's fault because they're in debt with a tough return yes.

&gt; The boundary conditions imposed by the common currency didn't sneak up on anyone and were not a bug but a feature.

People assumed Greece would take responsibility for their mistakes but no. As I said earlier Greece was an exception for the eurozone.

People actually do think they know that, but at least in Ireland's case, it's completely wrong. The total eurozone bank lending into Irish domestic banks during the euro never topped €18 billion - that's *all* eurozone bonds in *all* the domestic Irish banks, including but not limited to the ones we bailed out.

The supposed exposures of German and French banks to ""Irish banks"" had nothing to do with our domestic banks - those exposures were to their own subsidiaries in the IFSC. Nothing to do with our economy, nothing to do with our bank bailouts.

You don't have to take my word for it either. Here's Philip Lane (TCD economist) saying the same: http://www.irisheconomy.ie/index.php/2010/12/02/exposure-fears-for-irish-banks/

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; We'll probably need both, but a nuclear power plants take ten years to build. And that's just the actual construction. Add to that the initial planning phase. if we started today, we'd still be looking at 15-20 years before it'd begin to have an influence on the energy production.

Yep, I very much agree that we will likely need both in our energy mixture. And adding different sources into the energy mix does not exclude using also others. Some like to paint it in black and white and portray it as an either or situation, but in reality it's not. There's both need and room for nuclear, shale gas, renewables etc. as they each serve different purposes and each have their specific pros and cons. And to me supporting one does not mean opposing others.

However, it will also take years to get shale gas production going. In Europe it is mostly in exploration phase, and only some test wells have been made so far. If we, or more precisely companies involved, start to invest into it now it will take close to a decade before European shale gas really starts to change the natural gas markets in the EU. And I'd support that as it helps to reduce energy dependency from unreliable countries, and also helps in cutting GHG emissions.

&gt; Spain doesn't have much shale gas I think.

Just pick up that free energy, who cares if the production per m² is a bit lower? By the times the good spots are taken it's time to replace the first infrastructure and by then it has come down in price because of the mass production and research which is incentivized by mass production.

Except solar is only profitable when heavily subsidized. That's not a ""no-brainer"". Thermosolar is cool, but it has limited use.

I had a Praktikum with a permit that expired on August 31 last year. My boyfriend explained to the Amt that I was planning to stick around but I needed a little time to get things in order. So they extended an extra month. 

Then I began the application process to quasi-extend it again to go to language school in a different city, and was stuck in ""processing"" for months, yet still completely legal from October until February when I got my student visa.

So in my experience, it's not so bad to get a short term extension. Plus, when it is just to do touristy stuff like attend festivals I doubt they would hassle you too much. Most of the red tape is just so they are sure you don't need to claim public benefits and stuff, so maybe check your health insurance covers you for the extra time too, as they can possibly deny you based on that.

It doesn't matter what you are, what matters is that you can't wave it away as shitty ethnic engineering. It's normal, not exceptional, for machinery to fail now and then.

&gt;s for Japanese engineering being shitty? Nope, Fukashima Dachii happened because of inadequate safety backups

And? :) That is also an inevitability whether it's done by a commercial or state institution: the first is tempted to increase profits by doing so, the latter is tempted to free up budgets now and let his successors deal with the consequences later.

&gt;Concerning uranium, it is finite, but there is actually hundreds of years of it left.

... at current consumption rates. That's 15% of electricity supply, electricity itself being 1/6 or so of global energy use. Replacing everything with presently available reactors would make reserves last 5 years... not counting construction costs.

&gt;Concerning things like breeder reactor designs and moltern salt thorium reactors there are working prototypes

The breeders prove that they can turn thorium etc. into the heavier elements, but conclusive tests on the practical feasibility and net power delivery (including reprocessing of bred cores etc.) haven't been done. There are experimental thorium reactors being built and planned. It'll take decades before a viable commercial plan is in the stage where we can actually do a cost/benefit analysis in daily use (and even then big projects like nuclear plants are prone to cost overruns, see Olkiluoto etc.)

I understand that you seem to be eager to live in a city like Berlin but I would advise you to consider the whole package instead of just focusing where you want to live. You'd be surprised to find out how many foreigners were so keen on living in Berlin only to leave a few years later. 

Working in the Tripoint would give you the *best of three worlds*.
Since you are not in that much of a hurry you may even have the time to find an employer that will give you the chance to work 80 % and still make the same or more than employees in Germany/France. 

Edit: 

* Add to that that being fluent in French/German would be higher valued in Switzerland than in Berlin.
* Not sure about this; I think Primary school in Baden-Württemberg offer French lessons. Is that available in Berlin? Plus your children would be closer to France and family over there.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"Actually, I think you may be confusing government bonds with capital movement. 

As for 'periphery', as has been said, that was hardly a eurozone effect. Iceland had exactly the same situation, despite not being in the eurozone, and expanding mostly into another non-eurozone country, the UK (which also suffered a banking crash).

It's rather more credible that the financial crash followed on from the wave of financial deregulation through the Nineties, just as the previous financial banking crash in the Thirties followed on from the deregulation of the Twenties. Financial regulation has indeed been repeatedly identified as a major contributor to the bank problems in this crisis - but it apparently doesn't suit some people to accept or admit that.

It sometimes strikes me that there's two narratives to the financial crisis. One is that laissez-faire financial regulation caused the problems, and that the solution is reimposing stricter regulation. The other narrative is that the euro caused the problems, and the solution is to abandon the euro.

I can't help but note that one of these narratives suits the financial industry very well, and is also the narrative you invariably find being pushed very hard by any media associated with the City of London.

Fortunately, the EU seems to have communally decided that the problem is more likely to lie with bank regulation.",0,1397827857,null,0,false,0,cgvp2gx,t3_23ccpi,t1_cgvp2gx,t1_cgvoiqs,null,1433411462,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,IntelligentNickname,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; Saying the Euro is at fault for the crisis because it can't be devalued is like saying cars are responsible for accidents because they are so fast.

Not a good analogy because euro isn't responsible for the crash, it's responsible for not being able to fix it as smoothly as other currencies. Crashes are difficult to predict and it's always easy to be smart in hindsight. Therefore a better option is to have a system so you can easily repair the damages.

&gt; The fixed value across the Eurozone is the feature that allows cross-country supply chains to be created, just like the speed of the car makes it a great means of transport.

Still not a good analogy.

&gt; The blame lies with the national governments that didn't adapt their policies to the changing circumstances, be it by being responsible in their own nations or by giving the EU the proper authority to regulate the Eurozone to counter such crises.

No. Governments and banks are selfish. You can't give them a carrot and then be surprised they take it. Obviously in a democracy the will of the people usually goes, and in the case of Greece, the will of the people was to ignore the debt.

Still, the problem was that Greece could not repair its debt, which they could've if they had their own currency. To be realistic the eurozone is a bad idea because there will always be carriers. In the end Germany for instance don't want to spend billions trying to stabilize Greece because they are too lazy to do it themselves.

In simple terms, if they had drachma, the crisis wouldn't be as big as it is today because then Greece would go under themselves and then they have to fix it themselves.",0,1397828034,null,0,false,0,cgvp4mt,t3_239eiu,t1_cgvp4mt,t1_cgvon2u,null,1433411489,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,bobdole3,UNSA,United States of America,"The economy is based largely on faith in the stability and growth of the market. The dissolution of NATO would seriously shatter faith, because security is one of the most basic services provided by the government. For the last 70 years, the US has been the guarantor of western safety. Whether this was good or bad, losing this stability would throw the West into turmoil. How this would play out would vary depending on country, but here's how I think it'd break down.

Eastern Europe is the most obvious. In this case, the markets are *literally* unsafe. Unsafe as in, if you do business there, you might be killed by Russian soldiers, or your assets might get siezed. This shouldn't need much more explanation. 

Western Europe meanwhile might not be in immediate danger, but the situation is still very chaotic. Suddenly, the bear next door is awake, and there's no one to keep him at bay. The states of Western Europe would likely immediately see a huge spike in defense spending. The problem is, there's nowhere to get this money, so you're probably going to see cuts in the social sector, which is going to make people even more upset than they already are.

I'm not really sure what will happen to the EU as a whole. It might disolve. Russia might be able to take a few of the EU member states to start with, and it's entierly possible that the remaining nations don't place enough faith in eachother to consider the EU viable. Or maybe it will go the opposite way, and take a crash course towards federaliztion. Either way, it's going to be a massive overhaul of the economics and politics in the region, which is going to make a lot of people unhappy. Between the chaos and rapidly shifting spending priorities, many investors in the region might lose business, while others will be scared away.

In the US, no one will ever trust anything ever said by an American ever again. After spending the better part of a century posing as the ultimate defender of justice and freedom, it threw all of the people depending on its protection to the wolves without a second though. International treaties and trade deals are going to fall apart, not just with European states, but across the world. Countries start looking at other rising stars to spend their money and get protection from, so money will start flowing out of the US into the BRIC states. Israel, South Korea, and Japan can no longer rely on the US to keep their enemies back, so you're going to see escalation across Asia and the Middle East. But the US might attempt to salvage its image by responding to these emboldened threats; when so when the Chinese attempt to officially take the Senkaku islands, Americans might start shooting at them. And of course, this is before you take into account the massive domestic unrest which is going to result from the American government deciding to go such an insane an unpopular route.

That's also a bad analogy. Overall the eurozone isn't like a car going fast. It's just a plain bad analogy.

&gt; The point is that the inability to devalue is one of its important features, not some side-effect.

Important features? Not being able to devalue a currency is bad. In a recession you'll have a tougher time getting up for instance. The inability to devalue the currency was a reason why it was faught against. Why do you think other countries haven't got a similar eurozone? Because in reality it's bad. Look at how GB opted out for instance, same with Sweden. Norway doesn't even wanna get into EU because then it would be just giving away billions per year and get in return bad laws which says they can't do snuff anymore. It's ridiculously bad for carrying countries. The only reason why Germany accepts the deal is because they actually profit off Greece/Italy/Spains debts more than they lose.

On a side note, I do believe part-time engineering or science jobs are fairly rare (other than being some assistant at a university) so I'm afraid I think you might end up in a not-so-desired full-time job.

I mean, Russia invaded a sovereign country and annexed territory, something unheard of in the Western world since WWII, and the economic fallout totalled about 2 - 5% of Russian GDP, max. Western markets endured next to no volatility. So while it's a bitter pill to swallow for Russia, it's nowhere near the catastrophic economic meltdown you are predicting.

There will undoubtedly be some turmoil in Eastern Europe, and some ripples will be felt in Western Europe if Russia takes some territory from a NATO country and there is no NATO retaliation, but none of the massive economic consequences you're predicting. And the dissolution of the EU? Are you joking?

To clarify: we're operating upon the assumption that NATO does not react (which is a very silly assumption, but the one the author is making). I'm arguing that nonaction would cause NATO to dissolve. The downturns in the economy aren't coming from anything Russia is doing in and of itself, they're coming from the fact that the state of global security is being upturned.

Obviously, this falls apart if you're operating under the assumption that NATO could survive as an organization if it allowed an attack on a member state to go unanswered.  I seriously doubt NATO could survive that though. It's entire cause for existence for decades was to fight off Russia if there is an attack. However **if we use the assumption that NATO could survive after choosing not to defend a member, then you are correct, there would probably not be any big change in the world.** Seeing as NATO hasn't actually been tested yet, neither of us actually has much in the ways of evidence to support our points, so it's just speculation. 

However, the lack of any fallout in the Western markets thusfar isn't actually evidence that there would not be any fallout in the event of a NATO collapse, because NATO hasn't actually shirked any of its duties yet. There hasn't actually been much of a change in the geopolitical theater yet; the Russian Federation acting dickish is unfortunate, but not particularly shocking.

true,Spelter,THUE,Thüringen,"I have recently started testing Amazon Prime Instant Video and Watchever. Both offer free trial months so go ahead an give them a try.

Amazon instant video used to be called Lovefilm but is now being integrated into Amazon after they bought Lovefilm a while ago. It's so far the cheapest service on the German market at 49€/year which is about 4€ a month. The catch is that you have to pay the fee for an entire year at once. Since the streaming is integrated into Amazon Prime you'll also have access to free shipping and overnight shipping and the kindle library and all that usual Prime stuff. Worth considering if you're ordering on Amazon.de a lot.

In terms of actual stuff to watch they're a bit hit an miss. They offer an extensive library of movies and shows, however quite a lot of them are not actually included in the Instant Video program. Game of Thrones for example can be found (though not always the latest episodes) but you'll have to pay for each episode (Buy or rent). Same with many movies. So it's basically an instant streaming platform and digital movie rental service. Very few shows or movies in English and many shows are incomplete.

Watchever is about 9€ a month and focuses mainly on TV shows. There are many movies on there, just not always the latest and greatest. On many shows you can choose between German and English versions, no subtitles though. At first glance it seems there's less stuff on offer than on Amazon but bear in mind that Amazon includes that rental service that has you pay extra. Everything on Watchever's catalogue is actually 100% free to watch. However no GoT. 
Also offers seem to frequently fluctuate with stuff going in and out, licenses being revoked, renewed, cancelled, newly acquired etc. Found one show I'm watching will disappear from the service soon, another one that I want to watch used to be on there but isn't any more but is said to return next month. Licensing movies must be a mess in Germany from the looks of it. Didn't see this behaviour on Amazon so I don't know if this is unique to Watchever or if Watchever is just better at letting you know you better finish up that one show before the license runs out.

And then there's Maxdome. Haven't used it yet, just letting you know it exists.",0,1397835456,null,0,false,0,cgvs5xj,t3_23ccqc,t1_cgvs5xj,t3_23ccqc,null,1433412960,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

What we will get is probably a removed property tax alltogether because nobody dares to touch the subsidies of building services for owners and interest deductions.

So we're left with a weaker tax base and the net effect of the removal of the property tax will equal a huge increase in the value of the building for the owners.

It wont do anything to sort out the relative disadvantage of renting.

Either you're bad at economics or you don't know what the euro is. [Please read up.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone_crisis)

&gt; The important point is that both allow you to do things you couldn't without them

No, it only disables the need for currency exchanges.

&gt; It can be the dangerous speed in a car or too cheap loans with the Euro. 

This has nothing to do with the eurozone crisis. You don't seem to realize the problems. This isn't Ireland we're talking about. Ireland doesn't even have a problem with government debt, it has a problem with greedy banks. Ireland has enough to sustain their debt, unlike Greece, unlike south Italy, unlike Spain.

&gt; You mean like the CFA-Franc-zone or the East Carribean Dollar?

Smaller radius with the same type of GDP/capita. Sure then it works, but the eurozone crisis is because of a globalization problem.

&gt; To be fair, its per-capita monetary contribution is considerably smaller than the one of Sweden or Denmark.

Exactly.

&gt; There is no convincing case to be made for a connection between Eurozone-membership and negative consequences for a country's economy.

You're way wrong. Finland regrets being in the Eurozone already. Sweden will never join because it would be catastrophic for the Swedish economy.

The fact is the countries with smaller GDP/capital aren't able to sustain themselves in the eurozone and therefore they go under. They need a currency themselves can devalue.

&gt;Le congrès faisait suite à la décision de la Cour de cassation de Belgique, le 9 novembre, de confirmer un précédent arrêt de la cour d'appel de Gand, le 21 avril 2004, qui condamnait pour racisme et xénophobie plusieurs associations « proches » du Vlaams Blok : Vlaamse Concentratie (VC), Nationaal Vormingsinstituut (NV) et Nationalistische Omroepstichting (NOS), à de lourdes amendes pénales et risquait d'entraîner, à court terme, une mise hors-la-loi du parti lui-même. En effet, la loi dit qu'un parti que la justice qualifie de ""raciste"" peut se voir priver de sa dotation publique. Or le VB ne pouvait prendre le risque de voir ainsi s'échapper une partie non négligeable de ses finances.

&gt;Le parti change donc de nom, tout en conservant les mêmes initiales (VB) et les mêmes couleurs, le noir et le jaune, qui sont celles de la Flandre. En prévision de l'arrêt du 9 novembre, qui était attendu, le parti avait préalablement modifié ses statuts, renonçant à demander « le renvoi vers leur pays [d'origine] de larges groupes d'immigrés non-européens », et fait désormais campagne pour une non-acceptation de ceux qui « rejettent, nient ou combattent notre culture ».

La storia del campo sacro del “mithos” è anche la storia dell’Essere al potere del mito: ma solo nella sua varietà di Bildseyn, di immagine dell’Essere animato, mai quale volontà di potenza della metafisica dell’immagine del mondo.
Anzi il campo sacro del “mithos” con la sua Bildseyn influenza la mondità, mai può essere soggetto, giacchè la sua fondatezza si disvela sempre dalla metastabilità dell’abisso, dell’invisibile, dell’indicibile, dell’inaudito, dell’aldilà che si presentano di fronte, davanti, in-contro alla mondanità, e si gettano nella sua fondatezza senza essere mai fondati.
In quel senso il campo sacro del “mithos” è libero, è più libero, dalle immagini del mondo: la storia mitika del “mithos” è la libertà dalla volontà di potenza della metafisica nichilista, della fine della storia; è più libera, giacchè abbandona le immagini del mondo per gettare in-contro le immagini dell’Essere animato.
Il campo mitiko non è stato, e non sarà mai una nuova metafisica, se mai è la Teontologia, senza essere ontologica: si eventua invece quale alterità, senza essere differenza, e quale relatività senza essere dispiegamento.
Il campo sacro del “mithos” è la radura ove si getta e si incontra sempre di fronte l’evento dell’immagine dell’Essere animato.
La storia del “mithos” è la storia dell’accadere della presenza, volontà e potenza dell’immagine dell’Essere che si dispiega dall’abisso, dall’aldilà, dall’invisibile, dall’indicibile, dall’inaudito: che decostruisce il tempo e l’immagine del mondo, dell’Esserci, della metafisica imperante nichilista.
Il campo sacro del “mithos” crea lo spazio alla Bildseyn che si eventua dalla metastabilità dell’Abgrundseyn, ma non dà fondatezza alla Grundseyn: si svela in-contro, di fronte, in relatività, quale immagine dell’Essere mai fondata, né fondabile dalla immagine del mondo, o dell’Esserci, o della ontokronia della topology-dasein: Teontologia della Bildseyn quale intervolto, intervarietà della Ikonaseyn del pensiero poetante.
Il campo sacro del “mithos” della ontokronia della topology-dasein è la storia della differenza del venirci in-contro dell’Essere e del suo gettarsi nel mondo, nella Physis cosmica: in qualità di immagine dell’Essere che si eventua, quale Essere animato metastabile dell’intervarietà dell’Abgrundseyn: nella sua varietà della semplice gettatezza nella storia dell’Esserci, o dell’Essere al mondo.
Mai mondo nell’Essere o volontà d’Essere mondità dell’immagine dell’Essere.
Daseyn e Bildseyn sono i sentieri del campo sacro del “mithos” ove si eventua l’in-contro la Gegenseyn della topology-dasein ontologica .
Lì la risonanza dell’Essere che ci in-contra, dà senso alla Teontologia, quale alterità della metafisica nichilista, in relatività con l’ontologia poetante della Physis .
La storia di quell’in-contro si in-contra nella risonanza della storia del “mithos”, quale storia dell’immagine d’Essere che si getta di fronte all’immagine del mondo o dell’Esserci: Bildsetn che si getta in-contro al Daseyn.
Il campo sacro del “mithos” della Physis è quella Topologia ove la storia mitika si eventua quale Bildseyn del Daseyn, ed anche dell’immagine del mondo, attraverso l’immagine dell’Essere animato in relatività con l’immagine dell’Essere che si getta dall’aldilà, dall’invisibile, dall’abisso, Abgrundseyn, indicibile, inaudito.

In practice, the Nazis never did it really right, there *was* significant micro-management and top-down idiocy. Say, Hitler insisting on those new-fangled jet engines to be slapped to bombers instead of fighters, and general disregard for underlings actually knowing stuff better, or even just having a better idea of the situation on the ground.

Implementing that thing right includes very significant amounts of antiauthoritarianism, fostering of clear understanding of doctrine, training people to positions higher than they actually occupy (so they can understand the *intent* of the orders given to them, and improvise around that), and even the willingness to not even chide people for finding sub-optimal solutions to not stifle their initiative.

In the end, actually engraning that thing as intended into some organisation to mastership seems to be neigh impossible if circumstances aren't exactly right.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt;  Putin is wrong when implying it's not possible for Finland to do without Russian gas.

He is wrong about several things, that being one of them. He very clearly tries to make Russia seem much more significant than it is. He claims the US would not depress oil prices because it would reduce the demand for dollars. Russia holds about 0.7% of US Treasuries, and the next 15 largest oil exporters hold 1.4%. Many other countries accept alternate currencies like the Euro or Yuan already for energy shipments. 

The energy trade is not what is propping up the dollar, as many seem to think, including apparently, Mr. Putin. Even if one morning energy exporting countries stopped using the USD completely, it would certainly depress demand for the dollar, but it would not be fatal. 

Given the fact Russia has been one of the most outspoken critics of the USD as a global currency, yet its largest stock exchange is denominated in USD, shows disusing the dollar easier said than done for developing economies. 

He used the Fed's initiation of QE as a reason to call for a new global currency and push the Ruble as a regional currency. He blamed the Fed for inflating away the world's wealth. A couple days ago, the Russian Finance Minister said $65 billion of foreign capital left Russia in the first quarter of this year because the Fed began reigning in dollar liquidity in the past few months (reversing the ""evil"" policy designed to ""steal"" the world's wealth). Turns out the economies of the BRICS were largely dependent on cheap dollar liquidity prompted by Fed QE, and that is what fueled much of their growth the past few years. QE was a good anti-dollar propaganda tool, but in reality his economy relied more on dollars than before because of it (There was a similar sentiment by the Brazilian Finance Minister). 

Either Putin does not know very much about the state of the Dollar, the global economy, or economics in general, or he chooses to ignore glaring facts to make himself and Russia look more powerful than they actually are. Considering I do believe he is fairly intelligent and informed, I'm going to assume the latter.

There are more forms for declaring expenses that are tax deductible ..etc..
The usability of the site is questionable, but it's decently easy, any common working adult can file their own taxes without much help.

Paying for taxes:
- There is tax withholding, which is mandatory on full-time jobs.
Besides that, when you file your taxes you provide a bank account number for reimbursement and/or you have a bank account number and instructions on how to pay your taxes through home banking or from a ATM machine.

Est-ce que tu vois Israël ou Singapour dire ""on est trop petits, il faut absolument fusionner avec les 27 États alentour"" ? Qu'attendent les ~180 autres pays moins riches que la France pour se suicider si la France ne vaut plus rien ? Comme disait De Gaulle, ""comment voulez-vous que les autres croient en vous si vous n'y croyez pas vous-même"" ?

Les Français ont le droit de refuser l'équivalent des réformes Hartz et la désorganisation du service public, tout comme les Allemands ont le droit de refuser de payer toujours plus pour l'Europe du Sud. L'euro impose aux peuples d'adopter les mêmes choix sociétaux que l'État-membre le plus compétitif, ça ne marche pas, ça ne marchera pas : toutes les monnaies supranationales de l'histoire ont fini par disparaître.

&gt; Le travail du diplomate n'est pas d'imposer la volonté de la France. La diplomatie/politique extérieure que tu proposes est une politique de l'isolement que la France a tout à perdre à mener. [...] on peut faire comme on veut sans négocier un minimum avec nos voisins.

Tu iras dire ça à Mélenchon qui veut désobéir au traités et imposer sa version de l'Europe aux 27 autres. Nous à l'UPR on se réfère au droit. Nous sommes le seul mouvement politique en France à dire qu'une ""autre Europe"" est impossible, que ça mène au désastre (comme les évènements le confirment) et qu'il faut en sortir le plus vite possible par l'article 50 du TUE. 

Et ça ne veut pas dire qu'on arrêtera de commercer et parler avec nos voisins une fois sortis, tout comme on peut entretenir de bonnes relations avec les voisins de palier tout en ayant des relations pus étroites avec un cousin vivant à l'autre bout du globe.

&gt; une armée tenue par du chewing-gum et de la ficelle

La France n'est certes plus une très grande puissance, mais le monde attend qu'elle joue son rôle. ""La France n'appartient pas qu'aux Français"" dixit Asselineau. C'est le pays des Droits de l'Homme, qui s'oppose aux empires, qui représente un autre Occident n'ayant pas le culte du ""toujours plus de fric"". Si la France n'est plus respectée aujourd'hui, c'est bien parce que de la France de De Gaulle, elle est devenue le larbin des Américains. 

Tu disais qu'il n'y a pas de ressources en France, figure-toi qu'il n'y en a pas en Europe non plus. Au lieu d'entretenir les meilleures relations possibles avec les pays d'Afrique et du Moyen-Orient, avec lesquels nous avons des liens qui s'étalent sur plusieurs siècles, qui auront encore un peu de pétrole et qui dépasseront démographiquement l'Europe à ce rythme, on se coupe d'eux dans une construction racialiste et en participant à guerres néo-coloniales menées par les gouvernements américains. Des queues record se sont formées devant les ambassades françaises après le discours de De Villepin contre la guerre en Irak à l'ONU. Le logiciel France est actuellement endormi par la vassalisation européenne, mais il peut très bien repartir si on le remet en route.

A century or two ago, around the 1800s, we had a lot of **social problems** due to widespread alcohol abuse. Especially amongst working class families this was a problem. Due to an increase in production due to better technology it became more widespread. 

- In 1919 we had a national referendum on **prohibition**, i.e. the prevention by law of the manufacture and sale of alcohol. The goal was no alcohol consumed at all.

In [the official history of our monopoly](http://www.vinmonopolet.no/artikkel/om-vinmonopolet/dette-er-vinmonopolet/historie), our trade partners are held accountable for the introduction of the distribution/retail monopoly (1922). **France** especially fought for the ability to sell their wine. If we wanted to continue exporting our products to their market... This was just after World War I, the economic malaise of the time was felt everywhere.

It's also worth noting that Norway is a Lutheran (Protestant) Kingdom; religion played a role in society then. Industralization was almost a century old in Norway. Parliamentarism was introduced in 1884. The social-democratic **labor** movement came to power around this time (1928).

Or cut it with the legal system and go all gray market (due to overregulation and overtaxation about 35% of Lithuania's GDP is in the shadow economy). 

Oh about that farm... If a law that is currently in our parliament (not an EP initiative, but a reaction to EP requirement to allow sale of agricultural land to foreigners) passes, in order to buy some farming land in LT you will have to:

1. Have relevant education in agriculture. 

2. Have a farmers permit (200 Euro and lots of paperwork). 


3. Have no less than 3 years of farming experience (and not just renting the land, you will have to meet certain quality standards and quotas in your production). You literally have to be a farmer with experience to get some land for farming. 

4. The land sale will have to be approved by a committee of local farmers and bureaucrats. (local farmers will be able to decide if they want competition or not.)

5. Be able to speak Lithuanian. (foreign investment in the aggro business? Screw that. We need our empty fields of nettles, thistles and dandelions. They are a sacred relic of the peoples!).

Se la dicitura ""Costituzione più bella del mondo"" è relativamente recente (se non ricordo male è una benignata di non molti anni fa), il concetto ad essa sotteso - cioè quello per cui la Costituzione italiana è una specie di picco legislativ-politic-ideale insuperato ed insuperabile - è un mito che nasce per motivi propagandistici contemporaneamente alla Costituzione stessa e da lì si propaga.

Questo mito nasce per via della necessità delle forze di sinistra (segnatamente il Pci) di far passare nell'opinione pubblica di riferimento il concetto che l'accordo di sistema con cui si rinunciava all'approccio rivoluzionario a vantaggio di quello istituzionale (accordo che, non dimentichiamoci che siamo nell'immediato dopoguerra, aveva sollevato svariate perplessità nel corpo sociale che si riconosceva nel Pci) era buono e giusto. Per far passare questo concetto, era necessario dipingere il suo principale risultato - ossia la Costituzione - come un clamoroso passo in avanti che solo la partecipazione del grande partito dei lavoratori aveva reso possibile.

Affinché questa operazione fosse possibile, al Pci servivano delle bandierine piantate nei posti giusti. Da cui discendono la Repubblica fondata sul lavoro, lo Stato che deve rimuovere gli ostacoli politici e sociali che impediscono il pieno sviluppo della persona umana, l'Italia che ripudia la guerra e - più in generale - tutte quelle disposizioni prescrittive che si trovano soprattutto nella prima parte e che, non a caso, più che una Costituzione sembrano linee guida per un governo di centrosinistra. 

L'operazione riesce: la Costituzione viene presentata come documento avanzatissimo frutto della correzione di rotta impressa dal Pci a maggior gloria della giustizia sociale e delle conquiste del proletariato e nell'opinione pubblica (anche quella non comunista, dato che la tentazione di dirsi bravi da soli è trasversale) si consolida l'idea di essere davvero un passo avanti all'universo mondo.

Nonostante cozzi con altri miti successivi (segnatamente quello della resistenza tradita e quello della doppia lealtà), il mito della Costituzione più bella del mondo resiste ai decenni. La Costituzione perde gradualmente la propria funzione di regolamento del gioco per assumere quella del totem sacro ed intoccabile (ed ovviamente circondato da nemici smaniosi di buttarlo giù, perché dovunque c'è un totem ci sono le forze oscure dell'iconoclastia in agguato). In forza di questo si viene a creare una mentalità diffusa riguardo alla Costituzione che è conservazione pura: vietato dire che c'è qualcosa che non va, vietato dire che c'è qualcosa che andrebbe cambiato, vietato dire che c'è qualcosa che andrebbe fatto sparire. L'unico tentativo andato in porto di riforma della Costituzione è quello fatto nel 2001 dal centrosinistra, che in quanto depositario del ruolo di guardiano della Costituzione ha una qualche agibilità, e a cui comunque più che toccare l'ultima parte (che per qualche strana ragione è meno più bella del mondo della prima) non viene concesso.

Il resto dei danni li fa la retorica costituzionalista applicata alla lotta dura contro Berlusconi: totem del Bene di qua e totem del Male di là.

Mmmh wikipedia says (I had to google diglossia &gt;_&gt;) that Italy has more something like ~~didalia~~ dilalia going on, which I think is correct (what I'm saying here about neapolitan and naples will be partly or totally true for a lot of other places/languages in italy as well).

Meaning that while it's true that 1. neapolitan and italian both coexist in Naples and 2. italian is the language used in formal / official occasions, it's also true that 3. non-formal conversation can happen in both languages. I talk in both with friends/family/random strangers. Of course some people prefer one over the other, and even though it's rare, some people just know one of the two, but it usually doesn't matter and you don't have to know neapolitan to buy something on the streets in Naples, altough it probably helps. :)

I once had a girlfriend from a good part of the city who didn't speak neapolitan at all and wasn't very good at understanding it either. It really blew me away at the time (and of course she was fluent by the time we broke up), but yeah these people exist. The same way there are those old people that come from a time (up until the 1950's or something) where they pratically only spoke neapolitan.

To answer your second question: neapolitan is still spoken widely (and wildly) in Naples and the sorroundings, or wherever there are neapolitans (we have a tendency to spread apparently). And yes it does have a stigma, some people find that it sounds gross and don't allow their children to speak it, so that they grow up only speaking italian. This usually happens in the ""good"" part of the city, but can happen anywhere someone is ignorant enough to not see the beauty and the culture of a language that is way older than the nation they live in.




It also has a stigma outside Naples, but that has little to do with the language and more with being neapolitan. We're not very loved by some people in the rest of Italy. \^\^


Btw: the language is called Neapolitan in english, Napoletano in italian and Nnapulitano in neapolitan. The city is called Naples/Napoli/Napule. I just had to clear it, sorry. :D

However, in many Russian cities the infrastructure still is shit, which is kinda weird, so you either have bad or shit compared to Sweden where you have good or shit. I've lived in Russia for my first 10 years, mostly around [Astrakhan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrakhan). The thing with Russia is that infrastructure is only good for St Peter and Moscow, where other cities and rural areas are generally worse in everything (as you said, 2-3 large cities, others tend to get worse and worse, but it's a nation of 140 million, so we have a bit more than 2-3 large cities).

We had frequent power cuts in our apartment. Heating was only an option during winter - you couldn't turn it on during other time, I mean, there was no reason, but still. Hot water was turned off for two weeks or so every 6 months due to maintenance. We had a tramway, but no more. No buses - Marshrutkas tend to act as such. Trains are only out of town. There's an airport but I believe it is for domestic flights only, I never used it.

A state works, as far as this discussion is concerned, in this way:

1) It collect the taxes from the citizens.

2) Once the amount of money is collected, some of it is spent for the central government, and part of it is sent back to the local administrations (regions, provinces, comuni).

So we can subtract the money spent for the central administration, and see: how much money is each region giving? and how much money is each region getting back?

That's called by economists ""fiscal residue"" (in Italian: ""residuo fiscale""). You can see a nice graph of it here, the data is provided by the Ministry for Economical Development each year, is no secret!

So, as you can see, we can easily establish that some regions are ADVANTAGED by redistribution via taxation, while some others are DISADVANTEGED.

European countries like Greece and Portugal borrowed over their means which was facilitated by the Euro, and the creditor banks essentially betting Euro nations would not be allowed to default. Also from joining the Euro, these countries lost the ability to devalue their currencies to make their exports more competitive and to fend off deflation.

Today we see the effects of the latter. Much of Southern Europe is experiencing deflation, or is very close to it, and the ECB has done nothing except made speeches about its resolve to combat deflation. Euro countries with healthy inflation, albeit lower than the ECB target of 2%, seem to be driving ECB policy at this point. Despite the fact that currency creation and anti-deflation measures would significantly benefit half of Euro members, it seems the ECB might be only willing to take action when Germany starts feeling the effects of deflation.

Private sector of self employed: You fill out the form (2~3 pages, I think) and turn it to IRD. You can also do it online. 

State Employees: Taxes are levied directly from your paycheck every month. 

Social Insurance is also levied from the paycheck if you are an employee, state or private, and your employer is not a tyrant that threatens to fire you if you don't agree to work without paying social insurance (they are supposed to pay half).

Municipal taxes: At least in my municipality, the municipal tax form is just a single page, and since it's a small town, you pay in cash at the municipality building. 

Corporate income tax is probably a lot more complicated. Not touching that. 

There's also property tax, which used to be part of the municipal tax, but since 2013 (post-Troika), its also taxed by the central government, in a way that we are still struggling to understand.

Love: 

1: The Cities/towns/villages and their very unique history, 

2: the quality and diversity of education offered at universities (Germany managed to bring forth some of the greatest minds in human history so far), 

3: the rejection of any unnecessary nationalilsm/patriotism,

4: the language and literature,

5: its decison to step in as european avant-garde when it comes to solar power and stuff (even though russia might succeed Germany simply by finishing a nuclear fusion reactor but whatever...)

I'd change:

1: Schools and any kind of conventional education besides most of what happens at university,

2: federalism - this is the worst for German politics. It causes way to much political nonsense; but not only in Germany; Europe as a whole needes to become a *real* union, we could start this by accepting English, french and spanish as ""Europe-languages"" *everywhere*, which would aquire us to teach them a lot more sufficiently, etc.

3: German military-, pharmaceutical- and financial-industries need to be regulated; we need to get rid of them as they are now

4: the opression of progress by religion; really some things sort of appear plain ridiculous; whether it's as a scientist, a musician or a politician: there are too many restrictions for each of them which don't suit a seperation of church and state

5: international affairs and diplomacy; why is Germany afraid of calling Israel what it is? A US american colony? Why does Germany condemn Chinese, Russian, Southeaset-Asian, East-European, North-Korean, Middle-Eastern and Central African actions concerning human rights development and such while it's one of the richest states and good ally with most of the world's remaining richest states and could change anything by dedciding on some drastic but obvious political decisions?

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ehy, personalmente sono un grande appassionato di rap da quasi un anno e potrei stare qui a parlarne per ore. L'argomento è abbastanza complesso, soprattutto qua in Italia dove la cultura sull'argomento è rasente allo zero. 

In generale la premessa importante è che difficilmente troverai un rapper che non sia crudo, sincero e spontaneo nei testi. È una caratteristica base. Il linguaggio dev'essere semplice, di strada. Se riuscirai a superare questo scoglio di comprensione comincerai ad apprezzare i grandissimi testi scritti da rapper italiani e non. Ti dico questo non perché ti considero un cretino incapace di comprendere un pezzo rap, ma perché da come hai scritto penso tu non abbia dimestichezza col genere (lo ammetti pure) ed è un disclaimer che uso spesso.
Detto questo, arrivo alla tua domanda.
Di rapper che fanno qualcosa in più dei ""bambini povri"" ce n'è un sacco, anche e soprattutto lasciando perdere il rap più alternativo (che sarebbe troppo banale e scontato ma tieni, [ecco un esempio] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2pZ8C7ODSs) ). Ti riporto tre esempi.

Kaos One è uno dei rapper apprezzati da quelli che cominciano ad ascoltare rap italiano. Pur essendo molto diretto ha uno stile di scrittura molto lirico ed introspettivo e lascia da parte i temi soliti del rap internazionale. È uno più grandi e famosi rapper dell'old school italiana. Di solito non viene apprezzato perché ha un timbro vocale molto particolare. È generalmente molto deprimente quindi ehy, se sei sereno ti consiglio di non ascoltarlo o ti butterà giù. [Qui un esempio] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RqfQL6tXkM).

Gli A Tribe Called Quest sono invece una delle band più famose della old school americana. Sono stati tra i primi ad unire incredibilmente bene il jazz e la grande tradizione di musica nera americana al rap. Testi e basi curatissime, un MUST per chiunque voglia avvicinarsi all'hip hop. Davvero una bomba. [Senti qua] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHRnvjCkTsw). 

Ora finisco con qualcosa di azzardato. Mi hai accennato ai ""bambini povri"" e quindi voglio provare con qualcosa di più gangsta. Snoop Dogg è uno dei rapper più talentuosi degli anni 90 ma i suoi testi erano sicuramente molto spinti e cazzoni. Non andavano al di là dell'autocelebrazione, del sesso e della droga. Ma c'era di più - affrontava infatti l'argomento con un talento e una dedizione artistica IMPRESSIONANTE. Davvero un grande. Il flow, poi (cioè come il rapper scandisce le parole e come segue la base), è a livelli stellari. Le basi, poi..delle robe rivoluzionarie. C'era di tutto, lì dentro. Ritmi ipnotici, danzerecci, funky. Lo amo. [Qui una canzone tra le mie preferite] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI3yXg-sX5c).

Mi fermo qui, direi. Potrei parlare dell'argomento per ore perché mi appassiona - sono davvero innamorato dell'hip hop e ne parlerei per ore, ma meglio fermarsi qui. Enjoy brah!",0,1397858542,null,0,false,0,cgw2txy,t3_23ca2j,t1_cgw2txy,t1_cgvzyd2,null,1433418118,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

This isn't a major problem. Just look around and if a car comes you stop, if it decides to slow down and let you pass you pass. Otherwise let them pass and wave your fist.

&gt; Or even more annoyingly you need to ride on the side of that major road

Yes some people bike on the roads because they either bike too fast for the bike lanes, or the bike lanes don't go where they want to go.

&gt; During the winter, too cold or too snowy and so on. We should start betting on what few days the trains work as they should.

SJ are incompetent, this one is true for the winter.

However most of it is bullshit, such as:

&gt;  It's like that in every country, the largest cities are perfectly good but as soon as you step out of that city limit it's like a ""third-world infrastructure"". The further you get from the 2-3 largest cities/towns in a country the shittier the infrastructure gets.

Sweden has good infrastructure. We have municipalities who receive money from the state to improve or maintain infrastructure. Some are good some are worse. I haven't seen a terribly bad example yet.

&gt; ...we still have many shitty roads.

Our roads are fine. Mudslides happen sometimes and then we need to fix them, but that can take a while because you need to see when you can afford it. ""many"" here is less than 0.01% of all roads.

&gt; during the summer it's too warm or too rainy.

Our biggest problem when it comes to transport are the trians on the winter because they don't ""prepare"" for the winter or the snow and see it as an excuse not to travel because it's too risky or the rails have snow on them, or are too icy. SJ are compared to donald duck for their incompetence for instance. So yes, trains are a major problem a lot of Swedes are upset about, especially those who commute by train.

&gt;Things that you propose affect integrity of Yugoslavia, and the integrity of Yugoslavia can be altered only in the federal parliament, I'm not sure even of that, but it can be in the federal parliament and other federal institutions. 
Many plans get mixed here. You referred to the constitution and the laws when it suits you; and when it doesn't suit you, you come out with political proclamations. Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina can prevent Croats and Muslims, if necessary, from getting out of Yugoslavia, but we will not prevent you. We will not do that because we are a sovereign people. Gentleman, I did not come here as a god of war, which is how somebody from the Croatian Democratic Party named me, but I want to repeat, for the hundredth time, that the Serbian Democratic Party does not create the will of the Serbian people. It interprets it. We would lie to you if we said that you can adopt this and that you can do something with this in Europe.
Gentlemen from the SDA, for the last three months we've been talking about other rights. We are talking freely and openly about a different way of organizing Bosnia and Herzegovina, where some kind of a three-tier approach will enable Bosnia to stay united and Serbs, Muslims and Croats to stay in Yugoslavia for as long as they want to. This is a three-tier solution where the sovereignty of the peoples, as Mr. Bjelobrk correctly said, would be exercised not only at the level of the republic and the federal state but also in autonomous provinces. 
If you don't want this, we could agree with you leaving Yugoslavia by means of a plebiscite, but we shall use the same mechanism to prevent you from taking us out of Yugoslavia. We do not mind if you submit an initiative to change the constitution of Bosnia-Herzegovina. But you cannot do it this way. It has to be done through the constitutional commission, civil council of citizens which is where we would then vote. I'm trying to tell you, in the calmest way possible, the Serbian people know what they want. You want to tell the people in The Hague that this is a third or fourth republic that does not want to live in Yugoslavia, but you cannot do that because we want to live in Yugoslavia.
You can say that in your name. All the sovereign people in Bosnia can only speak for themselves. They cannot speak for other peoples. We have reached that conclusion in this parliament. Before the national and international public, we will prevent you from committing violence, constitutional violence against Serbs because the constitutional violence breeds all other kinds of violence. We will not be in control anymore.
This has been repeated here a hundred times. We will no longer be in control if we get into a situation where Croatia and Slovenia are, especially Croatia. The hell would be a thousand times worse in Bosnia-Herzegovina. There would be no way to stop it.
I ask you once again, I am not threatening, I am pleading that you take seriously the political will of the Serbian people represented here today, the Serbian Democratic Party, the Serbian Renewal Movement and some Serbs from the other parties represent. I plead with you to fully understand that what you are doing is not good. The road that you are choosing for Bosnia and Herzegovina is the same highway to hell and suffering that Slovenia and Croatia have already taken. Do not think that you will not take Bosnia and Herzegovina to hell and the Muslim people maybe into extinction, because if there is a war, the Muslim people will not be able to defend themselves.
Please, these are big statements, but serious situations demand big statements. How are you going to prevent people in Bosnia and Herzegovina from killing each other? How can the war in Croatia be prevented, especially in areas where Serbs and Croats live together and where their political wills have clashed without adhering to the legal framework which is the only way to resolve.""

Eventually, it got to the point where he had amassed a nontrivial amount of quality work, and that if he were going to continue in this vein, he may as well go to a University and do it, and eventually get a chance to defend his dissertation and earn a PhD.

The valuable lesson learned is this: studying something on that level of intensity, it has to be something that you are absolutely consumed by. The research will require you to devote your life. If it requires you to sacrifice things that you will regret, then it may not be for you.

I am not agreeing with Putin. I'm simply stating the reality. Russia has never taken a step back in an escalating situation until the other side has made a gesture of good will. That gesture is needed. 

People may think it's a far away possibility, but if things keep escalating, the path will ultimately lead to war. Maybe not this year, or the next, but eventually.

Come dice Kit_Emmuorto, fu una benignata di qualche anno fa, tre per la precisione, in occasione del 150esimo anniversario.

In quell'occasione, lo storico del risorgimento Alberto Mario Banti si permise di criticare le falsità storiche dietro quest'operazione di propaganda e ricevette critiche da ogni dove.

Si permise di criticare il fatto che le numerose iniziative di celebrazione nel centocinquantenario furono affidate per lo più a gente dello spettacolo (romanzieri, quando non addirittura, per l'appunto, comici), che con la storia poco hanno a che spartire.

Lamentava la totale assenza di coinvolgimento del mondo accademico, tramite la quale si sarebbero potute evitare cose a suo avviso insensate come celebrare l'anniversario a partire dalla costituzione del Regno di Italia e non dell'inizio della Repubblica, o come idealizzare un Risorgimento che è nato dalla stessa mentalità che diede poi origine ai nazionalismi del XX secolo.

Il suo articolo originale sul manifesto è al momento inaccessibile, ma c'è [questa intervista](http://alfredoferrara.blogspot.co.il/2011/02/lesegesi-di-benigni-unappassionata.html) che espone un po' il suo pensiero.

Let's make a very simple scenario, the country has in total 100million euro and you make 2500€ per month. You borrow 1,000€ from me, you only need to pay me back 1,000€ (plus interest). If we now make an extreme example and say we had 100% inflation (this is usually a big problem but let's assume it's not). Inflation is almost always due to an increase of money available, so now it would be 200million euro instead of 100m, as it increased by 100%. This means all costs increased by 100% and so are the salaries. You now earn 5000€ however it has the same purchasing power as it did before. If a loaf of bread used to cost 50 cents it now costs 1€, and because your salary went up by the same amount, you can buy the same amount of loaves as you could've before. However the strange thing is you only owe me 1,000€ (plus interest), even though it had the same purchasing power as 2000€ has now.

true,IntelligentNickname,SWED,Sweden,"No. As I said economics is extremely complex. It's a science about a science about a science. It's all very abstract and thus far none actually understands it. All economics do is looking at history and see what worked and what doesn't. If we actually knew what we are doing we wouldn't have crashes in the markets or recessions. We wouldn't even have economic rights or left.

To answer your question, banks profits from giving out loans on the interest. You'll notice you'll receive less interest for placing your money in the bank than borrowing. So essentially they borrow your money at 0.5% interest or whatever it is at currently, and then lend for 3% or whatever the rates are. That's just the idea of a bank in simple terms though, they do more advanced stuff such as stockmarkets, if I'm not mistaking they also do outsourced jobs for governments (printing money). However investmentbanks usually deal with stockmarkets more than regular ones.

If this was a realistic scenario, the interest rate would be at around 100%. They profit off your interest and when you can't pay them. They look for the ackumulative interest profits rather than one where you just pay off your loan, which is difficult to do. In reality we might have 2% inflation and 3% interest where they actually make money off that 1% because you borrow such huge numbers. You cannot pay back the entire sum either so they profit as time passes. As I said it's kind of complicated so take a look at [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank#Business_model).

To your last point, where China's ambitions must fail, is the countries hosting US bases for the most part want them there. China's neighbors like ASEAN, Japan, SK, and Taiwan all welcome more US involvement rather than less. They see China as a threat, not a partner. So China even having a similar network in its own neighborhood is unlikely unless it took land by force. 

What the US seems to realize, and the UK (after colonialism), is there is often a mutual benefit where both sides can get what they want without a shot ever being fired. The public perception of US troops in places like Japan and SK is overwhelmingly positive, and it is very welcome by their governments. So the US gets its ports, and Japan and SK enjoy an extra degree of protection, win-win.

true,[deleted],null,null,"**5 Great Things About Germany**

**1)** The friendship and familiarity young Germans have with one another. From my experiences traveling abroad (e.g. South America, East Africa) young Germans really look out for one another, and probably due to similar backgrounds get along very well. You can always throw a BBQ or a quick party with low stress with some Germans. Everyone knows what to bring and won't skimp on food or beer. In Germany I like the idea of the 'sneak preview'. The way the whole crowd gets into it is really pleasant (at least in my experience). It is something that would not be 'cool' enough for young people in the States. I also like how Germans view public property and desire/enjoy open green spaces.

**2)** Food. Brotzeit/Breakfast is great. Weichei mit Brot, Butter and Jam for breakfast, and/or Weißwurst mit Brezel. Spagel in season, and flammkuchen to name a few. Germans also are great at making pasta. And of course Döner. Beer is so standard on this list, I'm embarassed to write it out.

**3)** Being Green. Renewable energy/Erneuerbare Energie! Taking public Transportation and bicycling is standard. Recycling too. Trains and Mitfahrengelegenheit.

**4)** The organisation of towns and cities. (Although in some places you see these American style superstores with parking lots starting to pop up) You can quickly walk/bike from your flat/house to the nearest supermarket. Local bars are 'local'. Every viertel/city quarter has its cool bars and lounges to hang out. You don't necessarily have to go very far to meet with some friends at a cool kneipe or biergarten to catch a beer. 

**5)** Cost of living. Rent is so low compared to the States and Norway for example. Lebensmittel/food is relatively cheap and the quality is pretty good. You can really enjoy yourself even if you try to save. Going out is cheap. Getting drinks and seeing a concert doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg. There are a lot of special rates for students and young people. 

**5 Things I don't like about Germany/would change**

**1)** Germans are smug. Just by speaking English they are smug, and they often (rightfully) believe they know a lot about the United States. They have many stories/criticisms/jokes about the U.S. (Native American Removal, Corruption, Healthcare, Foreign Policy, Guns, Highway speed limits, how Americans talk about the weather, NSA etc.) on the tip of their tongues. It gets annoying. I know speaking English in Germany can be an indicator of class, and it usually shows that you are educated and went to University, but that doesn't make you an expert about the U.S. nor does it mean you should feel compelled to explain why things work in Germany the way they do. I don't work for the U.S. State Department, and of course I see how hypocritical the U.S. can be. But do we have to always go through the same motions and reach this awkward comparison of our countries? It gets old. When Germans here me speak Deutsch, and hear some dialectal influence, my syntax, and slang - they usually realise they should cut down on the tour guide crap.

**2)** I feel like Germany needs to embrace its multicultural identity better. I think with way the EU laws for foreigners (EU immigrants don't really have to integrate because they have full rights) non-EU immigrants are really being left behind. Germany is really not a big country, but there is a really big disconnect between how the German people in smaller towns and cities think about Germany and the reality. 1/5 of all of Germany's inhabitants are born abroad. And this is where most of Germany's population growth will come from. It's not my decision to make but there needs to be a genuine reflective dialogue about German nationality versus German citizenship, and a movement for more acceptance and promotion of minorities.

**3)** Germans' complaining about train delays or traffic jams or other people on public transportation. You have a right to complain, but the collective groaning, huffing and puffing doesn't help anyone. Maybe it's just me but I think that mumbling under your breath is really rude. Especially when the person you're complaining about can hear you.

**4)** Germans' expectations of other people (German or otherwise). Germans always have little systems whether it be how they organise the chairs in their flat, their trash, or their dishes. Germans also seem to get really upset when you mess it up. Your system is not always obvious. I think when issues arise, really bad passive aggressiveness manifests. It has been very annoying to deal with two German flatmates who instead of throwing dirty dishes in the dishwasher, decide to bring them into the room of the person who forgot to clean them up. Yeah, maybe German passive aggressiveness as a whole.

**5)** Points of view, and political/social/religious (or anti-religious) beliefs that Germans take for granted. Obviously these views are different from person to person, and also regionally. But I find that, because a lot of Germans are very confident in themselves and their views, they aren't afraid to make broad sweeping statements without considering someone they are talking to holds a different opinion. It is very strange to be in a deep discussion with someone when serious assumptions about one's point of view have been made.

I think you will have an advantage knowing German-French-English well. Not that rare in Europe in general, but less common among engineers in my experience. Have you considered sales?

The ""failing the PhD"" issue is a matter of framing. You could refer to it as doing research. You can say that you realized that you prefer working in industry to academics. I wouldn't worry about it too much. It is not as if you have been idle.

There is some sexism in the German labor market. I had at least one client that refused to hire young women because they didn't want their employees to take the legally allowed maternity time.

A lot of people claim deductions they aren't eligible for out of ignorance too - it's a messy inefficient system.

Also - for the U.S. your employer doesn't necessarily determine how much you pay in taxes.  They do withholding for state and federal taxes - but you basically tell them how many dependents to base the withholding on.

&gt;Of course, and you know that, I didn't say that. What I'm trying to let you understand is that we have an identity as a nation. We have shared culture, history, infrastructures.

Are we talking about the same country? Are you even Italian, have you lived in Italy for a significant length of time?
The only thing that brings our country together is the football World Cup. Culture, tradition, music, food, language.... pretty much everything is very different from north the south.
 Infrastructures are shared, that's true, and the north paid for them, and in the south they work much worse (arguably, because they are run from the south, and not for the lack of funding). And the north is kind enough to leave them to the south in case of a secession.

The colloquial construction ""am [verb]"" is used, like: Ich bin am Kochen. This means: Ich koche gerade. I'm cooking (right now, in this moment, right when you called me up and asked what I'm up to). I doubt this is *just* used in NRW. It's common but not ""correct"" German.

I'm under the impression the pronunciation of Ä can be non-standard, more like English ay I think. Not sure about the regional limitations on that. You also get 'ch' being said a bit like sch; this depends on where you are.

Gucken for look at/watch instead of (an)schauen. Pronounced like it starts with K. Dictionaries tell me you can spell it kucken; I have never seen anyone do this.

Numbers are normal. The -ig at the end can get a bit more like -isch than  it would in perfectly standard Hochdeutsch (to my non-native ears). When giving a phone number, you usually say zwo instead of zwei so it's distinct from drei. This isn't limited to NRW.

Expressions? Well, there's hellau (Dusseldorf) and alaaf (Cologne) for Karneval.

Kein Bock instead of keine Lust might be local/regional slang? I'm not sure -- largely I don't know if something is regional or not unless someone tells me, since it's all just normal to me.

A fun example most people haven't heard about: back in the day the Church really tried to ban bullfighting, up to the point of threatening with excommunication anyone who dared attend a corrida. And we're talking about the 16th century, we had the inquisition around and everything! People still showed up in masses. This kind of stuff kept happening for centuries.

More recently (and I'm old enough to remember this, you guys), since Good Friday is a holiday, well, people get together and when people get together the chances of a BBQ happening are close to 100%. So, since forever, in Spain you could buy yourself a waiver in your local church so you could safely eat meat on a Good Friday without going to hell... because since people were going to do it anyway, at least the Church would get a cut.

And don't get me started on priests having lovers and children being a pretty much accepted open secret in parishes even today.

true,lord_owen,null,null,"I moved to Spain when I was 10 years old thirteen years ago., to a rural part of Málaga where everyone speaks in thick Andalusian accents and barely anyone spoke English at all. Although it can be hard at first, as long as you have dedication you'll get there in the end. Within a year of living there, I was able to more or less communicate in Spanish (I had, and to a certain extent still have issues with all the extra verbal tenses + the differences between masculine and femenine words).

1) Make Spanish friends. I imagine you're probably going to a Spanish school, so get in with the locals. Carry a pocket size dictionary on you if you can't think of a word in Spanish, or if they say something you don't understand. Try to avoid mixing too much with the expat community, since every kid I knew who did that ended up not learning Spanish.

2) Try reading a bit in Spanish everyday. Buy a few, easy books (don't be ashamed to read children's books), or even pick up local free newspapers or magazines.

3) Watch films in Spanish with English subtitles. This can help you get used to the different accents and speed of speech.

4) Buy a basic English to Spanish phrase-book, and try learning a few things from it each day.

5) Initially, don't concern yourself about learning the grammatical side (verbal tenses, análisis morfologico, etc). When it comes to learning any language, it's always easier to learn the basics of speech first. The complicated stuff can always come later.

BTW quelle est la dernière fois que tu à vu un vote à 97% qui était legit ?

Sur un vote ou le choix est entre ""INDEPENDANCE"" (pour se rattacher à la russie dans 2 semaines) et ""Devenir russe immédiatement"" :

http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/06/ukraine-crisis-osce-mission-idUSW8N0LT00Z20140306

Et ou ils annoncent les résultats sur RT.com (l'organe de presse du Kremlin) 2h avant la fin du vote (je l'ai suivi et vu en temps réel. Ils se cachaient même pas de frauder le vote et en avaient de tt globalement rien à foutre).

Bref une bonne vieille élection à la soviet comme on en à rarement vu depuis la chute du mur.

Maintenant je suis conscient que la crimée était genre à 60% russe. Mais l'opinion réelle était autour de 50% de rattachement à la russie ou indépendance. Pas 97%. La russie à donc préférer envahir et voter pour eux. Un grand classique. Le fait que NATO ait fait des conneries en irak ne veux ensuite en rien dire que la russie ne l'as jamais fait.

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Line_of_protesters_at_Dynamivska_str._Euromaidan_Protests._Events_of_Jan_20,_2014.jpg

Yep totallement la même chose. Surtout en sachant que les ""little green men"" ne parlent que russe et pas un seul mot d'ukrainien (qu'ils n'ont jamais entendu de leur vie. Tu sais totalement comme les locaux de kharkiv ou donetsk), arrivent dans des bus marqués Soshi (j'ai plus la photo et c'était dommage; mais voir 30 hommes en vert armés jusqu'au dents avec des armes toutes neuves comme des AK74M ou AK2000, avec un drapeau russe sortir d'un bus marqué sotchi sur la grande place à donetsk en face du SBU puis déclarer qu'ils sont totalement des locaux faisant mineur comme métier et voulant leur ""indépendance"" ca vallait le détour).

Oui oui, la réalité, les armes de destruction massive en Iraq. Quelle naïveté. Un petit conseil : arrête de croire ce qui vient des US et de leur caniches européens sans croiser avec d'autres sources.

90% de la population de Crimée parle russe à la naissance contre 10% l'ukrainien. 

Le niveau de vie de la Russie est 3 fois supérieur à celui de la Crimée. 

L'Ukraine est un pays faible qui s'appauvrit alors que la Russie est forte et s'enrichit. 

L'Ukraine a pendant toutes les années 90 méprisé et affaibli la Crimée, en abolissant la Constitution de Crimée de 1992, en dirigeant la Crimée par décrets alors que le Parlement criméen s'y opposait.

Voilà ce qui explique le **rattachement** de la Crimée à la Russie.

Pour le reste de l'Ukraine, tu fais comme si le nouveau gouvernement était légitime ou populaire. En réalité, il s'agit d'oligarques, de banquiers, alliés à des nazis, mais comme ils sont contre les méchants russes, ça t'est égal, ils deviennent automatiquement gentils.

Interesting thing that /u/Kuerbel posted though, I had no idea there were laws that enabled you to ""force"" your employer to give you a part-time job. This is pretty cool.

For the age thing, easy (but kinda long) explanation!

I graduated high school at 16 (skipped a year as a kid ( ^actually ^skipped ^two, ^then ^had ^to ^repeat ^one ^in ^high ^school ^due ^to ^depression/school ^refusal ), plus I was born in October), then a Master's degree takes five years in France. I was in an integrated double cursus between partner universities so it only took 11 semesters instead of 10 to get two degrees instead of one. They're in the same field though, the advantage is only the binational aspect. So I got my degrees at 22, worked for six months as an engineer in the automotive industry and started my PhD a week after my 23rd birthday, almost exactly 18 months ago.

It might seem early, but in France we don't have the same freedom other countries have when it comes to education. I was always puzzled by German students graduating with their Master's degree at 27 or 28, taking only a couple classes per semester (with ample time to study to make straight 1.0's). We didn't have that choice! We had to take 8 to 10 classes per semester (with mediocre results), had exams in the middle of our Studienarbeit etc. Likewise, while French PhD students might take 4 or 5 years to complete their thesis in humanities, in scientific fields they mostly don't let us take more than the standard three years (because they're forced by doctoral schools to pay us).",0,1397903336,null,0,false,0,cgwg0kw,t3_23cei1,t1_cgwg0kw,t1_cgvq3md,null,1433424419,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

&gt;

&gt;The __Republic of Venice__ ([Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language): *Repubblica di Venezia*) was a state originating from the city of [Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice) in [Northeastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Italy) [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy). It existed for over a millennium, from the late 7th century until 1797. Despite its long history of war and conquest, the Republic's modern reputation is chiefly based on its status as an [economic and trading power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_Venice).

Not really.

I get your point but an analogy is just a tool. You've used yours to imply that the EU bares similarities between nazi Germany because we are United and have one flag and Germany leads us. 

Obviously Germany leading the EU is a little stretching of the truth and probably not meant entirely seriously. Also I would say people mainly criticise nazi Germany for their use of force in achieving their goal. Not its stress for a united Europe. 

The point of comparing Russia's actions to nazi Germany's is more useful in my opinion. Hitler got away with it purely because it is such a convincing argument.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; There was a vote to ban it. 

No there was not. There was a vote about repealing an illegal and unconstitutional language law pushed through by Yanukovich in 2012, and repealing that particular law - which did not happen - does not equal to 'ban'. 

The 2012 Ukrainian Law on Language Policy was one law among the about 300 illegal and unconstitutional Yanukovich's laws and acts to be repealed. The parliament (democratically elected in 2012, mind you) voted for repealing those laws, but the government did not repeal that particular law. The government's reasoning being that despite of it being illegally adopted crappy law it is better to prepare a better legislation first.

And it indeed is a crappy law as it disproportionally favours Russian language at the expence of other languages.

Before its illegal and uncostitutional adoption in 2012 Yanokovich's Ukrainian Law on Language Policy was heavily criticised by human rights watchdogs, academics and scholars, representatives of other minorities and ministeries as lopsided, substandard, and disproportionally favouring one language. 

The law was [criticized](http://www.uaba.org/resources/Documents/Blog%20Docs/12-08-23%20Amb%20Vollebaek%20Letter%20to%20Ukrainian-Am%20%20Bar%20Assoc_16%20Aug.pdf) by the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities as its *""approach to language policy is deeply divisive and is likely to lead to future polarization of society. Indeed, the disproportionate favoring of the Russian language, while also removing most incentives for learning or using Ukrainian in large parts of the country, could potentially undermine Ukraine’s very cohesion""*. He was also concerned that the legislation was not adopted in accordance with Ukrainian constitutional and procedural law.

The Council of Europe stated ([1](http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=CDL-REF%282011%29001-e), [2](http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=CDL%282011%29101-e)) that the legislation failed to provide a proper balance between the development and use of a state language as a unifying factor in society and the development and protection of minority languages in accordance with European standards.

The law was also criticized by Ukrainian legal scholars, the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and other academic institutions, and numerous ministeries within the Yanukovych government as divisive and failing to protect the rights of all Ukrainians irrespective of their ethnic background.

And the law had no effect in Crimea as an autonomus region. Nothing would have changed there whether that law was in effect or repealed.

&gt; I'm not making it up.

I know YOU are not making it up. You're merely parroting a propaganda lie made up by someone else.

Especially Russian state media has invented and spread lies such as: the new Ukrainian government had created a new oppressive language law (didn't happen) or repealed a law (didn't happen) or banned Russian language (didn't happen) with the purpose of oppressing the Russian minority (didn't happen) including Crimea (not even applicable). And variations of that have been repeated in the media.

What really happened was that the democratically elected (in 2012) parliament voted to repeal an unconstitutional and unbalanced language law. Repealing it would not have led to 'ban' of any language. But the law was not repealed because the government prevented that and upheld the law. So the terrible 'fascist' government actually protected the status of Russian language here. And none of it had any bearing on Crimea anyway.

&gt; Denn gerne wird ignoriert, dass auch Feiertage selbst im Gesetz eindeutig als ""Verbote von Arbeit"" bezeichnet werden - ein Verbot, das viele Freiheiten erst ermöglicht.

Welche Freiheit mir das Tanzverbot erlaubt, schreibt er da jedoch nicht. Es ist ja nicht so als würde ich jemandem die Freiheit nehmen Jesu Tod zu feiern wenn ich tanze...

Um das zu überspielen setzt er noch einen drauf:

&gt;Es wird gesagt: ""Ich bin dann frei, wenn ich jederzeit das tun und lassen kann, was ich will.""

Jo. Weil, es geht plötzlich nicht mehr um ein Tanzverbot sondern um ANARCHIE zu Ostern! 

&gt; Abseits dieser Äußerungen gegen ein ""Tanzverbot"" macht auch der Zeitpunkt der alljährlichen Aufregung stutzig: kurz vor dem höchsten christlichen Fest. Warum wird nicht am Volkstrauertag groß demonstriert? Warum werden hier keine Empörungsschreie laut?

Vielleicht weil Ostern FREI ist und es oft SCHÖNES WETTER ist und weil ich den Volkstrauertag erst einmal nachgooglen musste um zu wissen wann der ist? Btw: es ist immer ein Sonntag...

Zwischendurch hört der Autor komplett auf über den Sinn des Verbotes zu reden und beschäftigt sich ausschliesslich mit der Gegenseite die ihn provoziert. 

Dann kommt das:
&gt; Der Staat definiert durch das Feiertagsgesetz bestimmte Tage, die uns ermöglichen, uns aus dem Alltag auszuklinken. Das ist gut so.

Jetzt soll ich dem Staat auch noch dankbar sein dafür, daß er mir eine Art des ""Ausklinkens"" vorschreibt bzw. beschränkt? Really? Nach der dünnen Argumentation zu so einem Schluss zu kommen ist lächerlich. 

Er versucht es zum Ende hin noch einmal mit einer windigen Taktik: 

&gt; Zu einer funktionierenden Gesellschaft gehört Respekt vor dem, was anderen wichtig ist

Ich weiss nicht ob ich als Katholik Ostern irgendwie missinterpretiere aber wo stört mich das beim Eiersuchen wenn irgendwo in der Stadt jemand tanzt? Religion ist doch mein privates Ding. Ich gehe in die Kirche und dann nach Hause. Weder in der Kirche noch daheim wird getanzt. Wo ist das Problem? 

Nehmen wir an, daß ich mit einer schweren Grippe im Bett liege und die Nachbarn stören mich weil sie morgens Lärm machen wenn sie zur Arbeit gehen. Also stören mich die Leute tatsächlich. Ich werde geweckt, kann nicht mehr einschlafen, verzögere wahrscheinlich die Gesundungsphase und muss am Ende vielleicht sogar länger im Bett bleiben. Das verursacht der Gemeinschaft Kosten. Einen tatsächlichen Schaden.

Ich bin dafür, daß wir gesetzlich meinen Nachbarn verbieten Lärm zu machen wenn ich krank bin!

...und das wäre am Ende gerechtfertigter als dieses Tanzverbot.

We also have an army that is capable of defending us, and in case we got attacked I am 100% sure the German army would defend Poland with all it has to offer.

limit freedom of speech and make sure you let people preach your cause and by the religious, news papers and television. Doesn't matter if it's true or not, just if it's enough to get people moving.

Next step is to make sure you deploy secret agents in the region and create groupsof locals, or let them create themselves spontaniously, that will help your cause. You may pay them or support them in other ways such as food, gear or weapons. 

When the time comes let them group up and create trouble. First part is to protest and clash with the opposition, make sure you beat them out of the way and make them afraid to counter you and you don't need a majority to accomplish anything. Be aggresive and make sure you have to be stopped by force. This will only help to gather more regular folk that support your cause which then can use as a shield. But whatever you do, do not use deadlyweapons. Because as long as you do not use deadly weapons you can play innocent and do anything you want, you can take over any building, beat up anyone and destroy as you wish. scapegoating all the way and playing the self determination for the people card. It's also easier to do it in a corrupt country where you have a lot of anger towards the government already. You can place your own favorable government, make trouble and get good deals, or annex parts of the country.

I'm also sure (this is looking at the track record of what the CIA for example has done decades ago), that this has been going on for both sides. Free speech is a bitch, it's important but also makes foreign propagand difficult to control. The scale Russia is doing it.. will it's without shame. It's difficult to pick a side when it's a corrupt government on the one side and more assholes on the other side.

&gt;""Tanzverbote"" haben mit Religion oder der Kirche gar nichts zu tun.

Dass ein Tanzverbot ausgerechnet an Karfreitag nichts mit Religion zu tun hat, ist schon eine ganz schön steile Behauptung. Gleiches gilt für den Totensonntag:

&gt;Der Totensonntag oder Ewigkeitssonntag ist in den evangelischen Kirchen in Deutschland und der Schweiz ein Gedenktag für die Verstorbenen. [Wikipedia]

Das sind dann schon mal zwei Drittel der ""Tanzverbotstage"", die es in allen Bundesländern gibt.

#2. Die Konzentration auf Karfreitag sei ein Hinweis, dass es um Provokation gehe:

&gt;Vielleicht deshalb, weil neben der ""Ich lass mir nichts verbieten""-Mentalität noch etwas ganz anderes dahintersteckt: Provokation. Man will diejenigen treffen, die Karfreitag emotional tatsächlich als einen Tag des Gedenkens begehen.

Karfreitag ist einer der wenigen Tage, an dem es bundesweite Tanzverbote gibt. Es ist einer der ganz wenigen Anlässe für ein regional mehrtägiges Tanzverbot. Es gibt kein Tanzberot, das länger dauert. Es ist das einzige Tanzverbot, das regelmäßig auf einen Freitag fällt, und Freitag Abend gehen nun mal mehr Menschen auf Partys als am Sonntag Abend. Aber man kann natürlich auch eine böse anti-christliche Verschwörung daraus basteln, wenn man die Augen nur fest genug zumacht.

#3. Wer gegen ein Verbot ist, müsse gegen alle Verbote sein.

&gt;Sich so enorm über ein Tanzverbot aufzuregen und andererseits gesetzliche Arbeitsverbote dankend hinzunehmen, ist inkonsequent.

I don't even...

#4. Lust sei kein Argument

&gt;""Ich habe aber Lust dazu"" ist kein Argument, das in einer sachlichen Debatte weiterführt.

Es soll auch kein Argument für das allgemeine Persönlichkeitsrecht sein, sondern es ist dessen Inhalt. Es gehört zu diesem Grundrecht, z.B. tanzen dürfen, wenn ich dazu Lust habe. Wer dieses Recht einschränken will, braucht dazu einen guten Grund. ""Irgendwas mit Jesus"" ist kein guter Grund. Die Tanzverbote (mit Ausnahme vom Volkstrauertag?) sind fast alle ""zufälligerweise"" an christlichen Feiertagen, andere Religionen werden ignoriert. Und es geht auch nicht darum, z.B. Gottesdienste konkret zu schützen (ein Verbot eienr Loveparade vor einer Kirche während eines Gottesdienstes am Karfreitag könnte ich z.B. durchaus nachvollziehen), sondern es wird für einen längeren Zeitraum flächendeckend und emissionsunabhängig etwas verboten.

In the last 25 years US has assumed the role of world's only superpower and that has many more facets than just military. US has a huge economical influence everywhere, which reaps huge benefits for Americans at home but in order to maintain this power balance the stick must be used sometimes. This is why the US pours enormous amounts of money to maintain a military technological edge and muscle power over everyone else. This is dead obvious when you look at the level of contributions to NATO. US is by far the no 1 contributor.

For now, weaker countries in Europe have accepted their role in this power equation, tacitly admitting that NATO is just a protection tax they need to pay to US in order to benefit from their help in a crisis. This is, unfortunately, the only possible solution right now because Europe is such a mumbo jumbo of countries and cultures that it's impossible to have any one country raise to the level of ""leader"" without automatically opening wounds that are at least hundreds of years old in other countries.

Fortunately, EU is progressing quite nicely and we could become a single country within the next 100-150 years. This is obviously way beyond our generation so in the mean time we kind of need US to maintain it's big brother position, along with all the perks and responsibilities that come with it.

I have no desire to see US blood spilled to defend my country against Russia. However, if Russia ever feels like controlling Eastern Europe again, I would like to know US has my back without dragging its tail through political bullshit. I'll be the one marching towards Moscow but just give me a fighting chance.

As far as ""hating US"" goes, I must say this is unavoidable in your position. However the popular views on US are wildly different between Western and Eastern Europe. People in Western Europe have mostly forgotten what war feels like and many live in a fairy world where war seems like something from the Stone Age.

Well, at least for US it doesn't because there is no wage tax. It would make it difficult, if not impossible, to capture the ""wage tax"" data. Which means the number is either made up or not what it says it is.

&gt;What's the difference?

Let's call the wage W.

When the tax time comes this is how the tax is calculated:

1. You add to W all streams of income including bonuses, employee share ownership plans, stock dividends and capital gains, dividends from your checking and saving accounts,  income from rental properties, etc...

2. You subtract from W: 401k contributions, healthcare contributions, mortgage interest, property taxes, child credits, etc...

The number you get is called [AGI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjusted_Gross_Income) (Adjusted Gross Income). 

Now based on AGI certain deductions I mentioned above are phased out. Additionally, AGI is different for Fed and States.

Once you have the AGI you can apply the tax conform to your tax bracket.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; You're ignorant if you think this is what Russia wanted. This is pushback. They're losing influence and they're trying to exert their power to show they're still relevant.

And the proper European/American response to that would be a grander show of force to remind Russia (and Ukraine, and our other allies all over the world) exactly how little we tolerate violations of the international system we have created. By failing to response, we are allowing Russia to gain influence because Russia has proven it can flagrantly violate international laws and the system the Americans and Western Europeans set up with no meaningful consequences. That will only encourage other countries to do so as well, and when they do, they will look to Russia for help.

&gt; This is where diplomacy comes in. Give them something, we get something. And we always have sanctions. When you have two opposing military build ups, the only options start becoming military.

*But what the nuclear industry asserts as confidence appears more like a confidence game. The thick, reinforced walls do not surround all vital parts of a nuclear power plant—as the industry knows very well. One study of aircraft hazards, jointly prepared by the owners of two similar nuclear power plants more than 20 years ago, concluded, ""The control building is the only single building which, if hit, could lead to core melt.""[2] The control buildings at every nuclear plant in the United States are located outside the robust structures described by the industry. Thus, the nuclear industry's proclamations about the robustness of thick, reinforced walls may be accurate, but they fail to tell the entire story.* [1]

*In 37 of the 81 OSREs conducted, the security forces were unable to defend even one element of the target set successfully from simulated ground assaults.* [1]

*Nuclear power plants were not designed to withstand some forms of terrorist
attack, such as large aircraft impact, but existing safety and security regimes
provide some defence.* [2] 

*Published reports suggest that, in a worst case scenario, the impact of large
aircraft on certain facilities could cause a significant release of radioactive
material with effects over a wide area.* [2]

*Other ongoing nuclear plant security issues include the vulnerability of spent fuel pools, which
hold highly radioactive nuclear fuel after its removal from the reactor, standards for nuclear plant
security personnel, and nuclear plant emergency planning.* [3]

*A plane crash could trigger a 'significant radiological release', according to an inquiry into the expansion of Lydd airport in Kent.* [4]

[This really started back in November of 2013, when the EU issued the ultimatum to Yanukovych, creating the divide between pro-Russia and pro-EU/USA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE9jULgC42o).

When they lost, right wing student groups began the revolution. This is quite magic, the revolution happens when the West doesn't get what they want.

The US are organizing ""colored revolutions"" in ex-USSR countries since 2000 is well documented. The 2004 election of a pro-West government was the result of the Orange revolution in Ukraine.

It seems that this 2014 revolution is just the last attack against Russian interests. Unfortunately, the US got too greedy this time and Putin is now forced to show muscles, like in Georgia when after the colored revolution there, the new government was integrating with NATO and discussing putting a ballistic missile shield there. It was also followed by a Russian intervention.

You're not showing Russia anything that's helping the situation.

&gt;By failing to response, we are allowing Russia to gain influence because Russia has proven it can flagrantly violate international laws and the system the Americans and Western Europeans set up with no meaningful consequences. That will only encourage other countries to do so as well, and when they do, they will look to Russia for help.

By failing to respond... how? How is a military build up doing anything? What precisely is the *goal* behind a military build up? Intimidation? That's not going to work.

Here's some realpolitik. Russia can, will, and does violate ""international laws"". As have Europeans and Americans. Strong countries do what they want to weaker ones. If you're trying to implement some sort of standard, the first step would be to follow it. Right now you're taking the moral high ground and there is absolutely no basis on which to do so.

Secondly, we have no right to impose *any* rules on Russia. This is a matter of diplomacy. Russia is not a subordinate state that has stepped out of line that only needs to be slapped back into place. There is a necessity to talk them down, not *threaten them with military force*. 

&gt;What, exactly, does Russia want to gain from us diplomatically? What do you suggest we give them, in return for them returning to status quo ante? 

I suggest there is negotiation. That we give Russia something it wants. We get something from Russia in return. 

&gt;And even if they do hold up their end, all they will have proven is that we will reward those who militarily annex parts of other states. Imagine if we strike a deal with Russia in which they withdraw from Crimea (I cannot imagine how, but let's go with it). We give them wide-ranging promises and all kinds of goodies. What will we have proven?

It will have proven that Russia, one of the most powerful countries on the planet, can exert regional influence. Big deal. You think that's going to set a precedent? Because it wont.

Second, diplomacy doesn't exist in a vacuum, it's frequently conducted side-by-side with other operations to maximize outcomes.

In 1939, Estonian diplomats argued for the very same ""de-escalation at all cost"" that you approve, and in a year, the country was overrun by foreign armed forces, the government overthrown, with a puppet government asking to join the Soviet Union, resulting in an occupation that lasted for half a century, which caused more people losing their lives through executions and deportations to Siberian forced labor camps than the armed conflict Finland fought.
