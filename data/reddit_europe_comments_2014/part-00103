&gt;La colpa grave: ""La carente analisi del rischio"". ""La colpa degli imputati è certamente grave - scrive il giudice - ampia e netta, infatti, è risultata la divaricazione tra la condotta in concreto tenuta e la regola precauzionale applicabile"". E ancora: ""La carente analisi del rischio sismico non si è limitata alla omessa considerazione di un singolo fattore ma alla sottovalutazione di molteplici indicatori di rischio e delle correlazioni esistenti tra tali indicatori"" è scritto in sentenza.

peccato che non ci fosse nessun ""molteplice indicatore di rischio"" che avesse un minimo senso scientifico. grave rischio di una scossa entro il 2015? se anche fosse, cosa fai, OGNI volta che c'è uno sciame sismico fai evacuare la popolazione? no, perchè -dlin dlon, ricordiamolo- uno sciame sismico non è predittivo. Checchè ne dica il giudice.

EDIT:

Why Vigo, dare I ask? It's not a famously tourist city... Where are you from? Have you been to Spain or Galicia before?

Okay, here goes:

Firstly, the old town (Casco Vello) should be your first port of call. It's nothing spectacular, but the winding streets and old cafes/bars are good to see and relax in. If the weather is nice, choose a restaurant down on Rúa Montero Ríos and sit outside watching the world go by. 

Parque O Castro is nice, and gives good views over the city, and walk past the old walls of the San Sebastián fortress nearby. Parque Castrelos has a nice old house (with a museum/gallery) and gardens, and the 18th century Santa María de Castrelos church is close.

For museums, there's the MARCO in the city centre (contemporary art), Museo do Mar de Galicia (Galician history). Not sure what others...

If you can go to the Islas Cies, definitely go. The beaches are great, even if the water is cold. Also, Baiona is a nice nearby place, go to Tui and walk across to Valença in Portugal. Compostela is great for architecture further north, also Pontevedra is about 25 minutes away and is very picturesque.

Drink Estrella Galicia (EDIT: San Amaro and Ancora are good local craft beers) or white wine (Ribeiro or Albariño are the best, and local). For seafood, the pulpo, rape and percebes are always popular. Otherwise, codido gallego, empanadas, zorza, pimientos de Padrón, lacón and grelos are typical.

Cortina is nice, but very touristic and ""rich"" place. If you feel like walking, go see Tre cime di lavaredo, the most iconic place of dolomites.

Russia cannot credibly make such a promise, so they will not agree to an ICJ arbitration.

You seem to be under the impression that the UN and all its various related IOs are a government. They're not.

true,McNorch,gamer,,"Eh... 'na parola! Ogni regione (se non addirittura ogni città) adotta regole diverse, o meglio, le regole principali rimangono, ma ci sono tanti piccoli dettagli che variano da paese a paese.

Allora io ci provo, spero qualcuno mi correggerà nel caso dovessi sbagliare/dimenticare qualcosa. 

Nel tressette a 4 giocatori, si gioca a coppie di due dove il compagno di squadra ti sta di fronte (c'é anche quello a 2 ma é meno divertente) si sgama il mazziere (io e i miei amici facciamo a caso, ma se giochiamo al bar allora si distribuiscono le carte e il primo asso determina il mazziere) il mazziere quindi distribuisce in senso antiorario dopo aver tagliato il mazzo, ogni giocatore deve avere 10 carte.

Nel mazzo di carte ci sono 11 punti che possono essere ottenuti sommando le carte prese, l'**asso** vale 1 punto,  il **2** , **3** e le **figure** (Re, Cavallo e la Donna/Fante) valgono 1/3 di punto. **4,5,6,7** sono ***gli scartini***, e non valgono na cippa.

Ai fini dell'attribuzione della presa, ad ogni carta è assegnato un grado determinato dalla posizione all'interno della seguente scala (ordinata dal grado più alto a quello più basso):

* Tre

* Due

* Asso

* Re

* Cavallo

* Fante

* Sette

* Sei

* Cinque

* Quattro

Si gioca in ""passate"" di solito al meglio di 1,3 o di 5 passate, una passata viene vinta dalla squadra che arriva a 31 punti per prima (in alcuni paesi si puó interrompere una passata se si crede di aver raggiunto i 31 punti, di nuovo le regole variano, alcuni non lo permettono, altri lo permettono altri ancora lo permettono solo al termine della terza mano)

Il gioco inizia con il giocatore che ha il 4 a denari, e si procede poi in senso antiorario.

Prima che il giocatore butti il 4 a denari peró si puó ***mandare a monte*** la mano, e bisogna dichiarare il ***buongioco*** qui ci sono molte variazioni regionali (alcuni paesi/cittá per esempio non permettono di mandare a monte) ma di solito si manda a monte se un giocatore ha tre 7 in mano, se ha meno di 4 figure (1 punto e 1figura) se il mazziere ""ha dato le carte male"" (i precisini vogliono 1 carta a testa alla prima distribuzione poi 5 e poi 4. e li capisci che giochi con dei brutti perdenti, perché s'attaccano alla scusa piú stronza perché hanno delle carte non ottime).
Per quanto riguarda il **Buongioco** anche qui ci sono variazioni regionali/provinciali/cittadine/paesane. Il Buongioco vale 3 punti extra (o uno dipende sempre dalle compagnie con cui si gioca) e va dichiarato prima che la prima mano venga giocata (o terminata o addirittura a volte prima della terza mano)
Dalle mie parti si dichiarano 2 tipi di buongioco (i nomi probabilmente variano da nord a sud): **il buongioco
** ovvero tris di assi, tris di 2 o tris di 3 e **napoli** asso, 2 e 3 sullo stesso palo (o seme o come lo volete chiamare voi)

Se nessuno manda a monte si può iniziare a giocare, l'obbiettivo del gioco  come detto prima é accumulare 31 punti in una passata (se si fa 11 a 0  dalle mie parti si vince la passata per **""cappottone""**)  si gioca per pali (il giocatore che butta la carta per prima determina il palo/seme) la mano viene ""presa"" dal giocatore con la carta di grado piú alta, il primo a giocare la mano seguente é colui che ""prende"". Si prosegue fino a esaurimento carte.


Di solito alla prima mano ""non si parla"" ovvero non si possono comunicare le proprie intenzioni ai compagni di squadra  sia vocalmente che tramite ""segni"", alcune varianti vietano la comunicazione totalmente, si dice infatti che il gioco venne inventato da 2 muti.

Inoltre (copio da wiki) 

&gt;Il giocatore che per primo in una mano gioca una carta appartenente a un dato seme ha facoltà di dichiarare, solo di quel seme, i carichi che possiede, il numero di carte totali o, infine, può chiedere al compagno di fare una particolare giocata su quel dato palo. Restano vietate qualsiasi dichiarazioni o richieste a proposito di pali diversi da quello giocato.Tali dichiarazioni sono effettuate con alcune espressioni verbali tipiche; tuttavia l'adozione, principalmente nell'Italia settentrionale, di una più rigida regola di divieto di comunicazione verbale ha fatto sì che si diffondesse anche una maniera di esprimerle esclusivamente gestuale. Ancora oggi non è raro trovare giocatori che utilizzano i gesti tradizionali per segnalare il gioco. 
Di tali gesti si ricordano in particolare:

&gt;*""busso"", picchiando con le nocche della mano sul tavolo, significa ""gioca la carta più alta che hai di quel seme e, qualora tu prenda, ritorna prima od eventualmente poi nello stesso seme"";

&gt;*""striscio"" (o ""liscio""), espressa strisciando la carta sul tavolo, significa ""in questo seme ne ho altre (almeno una)"" oppure, se effettuato dopo aver preso su un ""busso"" del compagno, ""per il momento gioco così, ma non preoccuparti che ho la possibilità di ritornare nel seme da te bussato"";

&gt;*""volo"", dall'azione di lanciare la carta sul tavolo di gioco, significa che si sta giocando l'ultima carta del palo.

true,McNorch,gamer,,"Aggiungo (sempre da wiki)

La lunga tradizione popolare del gioco del tressette ha fatto nascere diverse espressioni tipiche per comunicare informazioni o richieste di gioco. Oltre a quelle già descritte in precedenza, le più usuali sono:

il ""carico"", termine derivante dal gioco della Briscola e indicante una carta di alto grado (in ordine decrescente il tre, il due e l'asso), può essere detto anche ""base di buon gioco"", ""pizzico"" o ""stillo"";

""busso la napoli"" (in gergo 'A Nàpule a dinare, coppe, mazze o spade) per accusare il possesso di una napoli ovvero Tre, Due e Asso dello stesso seme;

""voglio il 25"" per richiedere il 2 ed il 3 di un determinato palo;

""ho il 28"" per dichiarare il possesso dell'asso e del 2;

""ho il 29"" per dichiarare il possesso dell'asso e del 3;

""ho l'asso (o il due o il tre)"" per dichiarare il possesso di un dato carico;

""voglio il tre (o il due o l'asso)"" è una richiesta indirizzata al compagno di squadra e in genere implica che si possiedono gli altri due carichi;

se non si possiedono carichi si può dichiarare il numero di carte del palo giocato in proprio possesso specificandone il numero ordinale (es. se giocando una carta di un palo si rimane con altre quattro carte in mano di quello stesso palo si dice, riferendosi alla carta giocata, ""quinta""; se le carti rimanenti sono scartine allora si dice ""quinta liscia""); si ha l'obbligo di dichiarare le cinque carte maggiori e cioè il cavallo, il re, l'asso il due e il tre; per tutte le altre carte vengono definite a seconda del numero, lisce.
se non rimangono in mano altre carte di quel palo la carta giocata si definisce ""piombo"" o si dice ""qui sono piombo"";

""piombarsi"" è l'atto, strategico o necessario, di liberarsi di tutte le carte di un determinato palo,
""la meglio"", ""carta tre"", ""base franca"" o ""carta franca"" è la carta con maggior valore di un palo tra quelle che ancora devono essere giocate, e quindi impossibile da prendere con una carta dello stesso palo (ad es. se sono già usciti asso, due e tre, il re diventa ""carta tre"");

""ho una bussata forte"" indica che si hanno in mano il tre ed il due accompagnate da almeno altre tre scartine o figure tutte di uno stesso seme;

""un liscio e busso"" si dichiara quando si hanno in mano il tre e l'asso di uno stesso seme;

in altre regioni, sono rispettivamente ""busso"", ""ribusso"" e ""liscio e busso"" il tre, il due e l'asso seguiti da altre 2 carte dello stesso palo (in caso siano di più si aggiunge l'aggettivo ""lungo"" se seguito da quattro carte, ""lunghissimo"" da più di quattro carte);

""lisciare"" o ""andare liscio"" significa giocare una carta di valore inferiore a quelle già presenti sul tavolo, cercando di non aggiudicarsi la giocata;

""avere la chiusura in mano"", ""calare le mani"", ""essere franco"" o ""andare a terra"" indicano la situazione che si verifica qualora il giocatore di mano ha carte tali da essere matematicamente il vincitore di tutte le passate rimanenti. Tutte le carte ancora da giocare, dette in questo caso ""fatte"" o ""franche"", vengono prese dal vincitore direttamente, senza materialmente giocare le ulteriori passate.

""Secondo doppio"", ""terzo doppio"", ""quarto doppio"" etc.: re seguito da due, tre, quattro o più carte dello stesso seme.",0,1397243696,null,0,false,0,cgq0q3u,t3_22sgk9,t1_cgq0q3u,t1_cgq0pqd,null,1433313327,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

I've been doing a lot of reading about the immigration process (mainly trying to sort out pension &amp; health insurance) and have seen that it is possible to arrive (not sure what visa you would need initially) and then sort out the correct visa.

I would expect in your case that you should be able to provide a copy of your bank statement. You wouldn't be expected to have a German bank account, as the bank will want you to be living in Germany before allowing you to open an account.

Also with regards to which bank you choose, I expect that most of your banking will be done online, so try and find one that offers an English interface.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"In case of money grubbing pay walls:

&gt;SOME say economics in Germany is treated as a branch of moral philosophy. More often it is the worst sort of contract law. Throughout the euro crisis legal pettifogging has hampered rational policy. The German finance ministry is filled with lawyers, not economists, starting with its boss, Wolfgang Schäuble. Big decisions have often ended up at the constitutional court in Karlsruhe. The euro zone wasted time tightening fiscal rules that treated mostly symptoms (budget deficits) not causes (a deficient structure and crippled banks) and led to excessive austerity. The European Central Bank’s action that saved the euro in 2012 has recently been undermined by the Karlsruhe court, which thinks that the never-used “outright monetary transactions” (OMT) programme to buy bonds of countries that agree to reforms is illegal. And now excessive legalism has messed up the banking union, which will not live up to the promise to sever the doom-loop between weak banks and weak governments.

&gt;Having survived and returned to weak growth, the euro zone faces a new danger: deflation. But lawyerly nitpicking is again one factor holding up an effective response. Deflation raises the burden of debt and causes consumers to stop spending, because they expect cheaper prices. Low inflation makes it harder to adjust wages and prices relative to Germany. Headline inflation has dropped to an annual 0.5%, far below the ECB’s target of “below, but close to, 2%”. Some countries are already in deflation; any new shock might push the euro into yet another crisis.

&gt;Ensuring price stability is the core business of the ECB. Even the ultra-conservative Bundesbank in Germany, which opposes the ECB’s bond-buying, agrees it must act against deflation or even persistently low inflation. The Bundesbank’s head, Jens Weidmann, says he will consider entering the “uncharted waters” of QE (quantitative easing, in which central banks print money to buy assets and thus bring down long-term interest rates) already pursued in America, Britain and Japan.

&gt;German legalism is also affecting the ECB. Its president, Mario Draghi, who in July 2012 promised to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro, now seems to be doing whatever it takes to avoid a hard decision. He tries to talk down interest rates through “forward guidance”, and speaks of the ECB’s unanimous readiness to consider unconventional measures. To Philippe Legrain, a former adviser to the European Commission and author of a new book on the crisis (and once a journalist on The Economist), the ECB has a deflationary bias: contrast its inaction over falling prices with its hair-trigger response to the illusory danger of inflation in 2011, when it raised interest rates at the height of the crisis.

&gt;But that deflationary bias also in part stems from Germany’s influence—and inevitably that of the court in Karlsruhe. Many expect Mr Weidmann’s agreement in principle to OMT and to the idea of bond buying to turn to disagreement over specific measures. Karlsruhe’s hostility to OMT casts a pall over quantitative easing. The judges made much of the distinction between monetary policy carried out by ECB technocrats and economic policy that needed greater political legitimacy. The court said buying the bonds of some countries to lower borrowing costs discriminates against others, impairs the market mechanism, increases the risk of losses for the ECB and violates the prohibition on monetary financing of states. Yet almost any act of monetary policy is a form of redistribution between savers and borrowers.

&gt;Mr Weidmann hints he would rather buy private debt than government bonds. A rival school of thought holds that, in fact, buying private debt resembles industrial policy, in that it might favour some sectors over others. In any case, there might not be enough corporate debt to buy, since most euro-zone companies are financed by banks. So, beyond another small cut in interest rates (which are already close to zero), or the imposition of negative deposit rates, the ECB might end up buying sovereign bonds after all.

&gt;One worry is that QE might not make much difference, doing too little to raise inflation and failing to stimulate more lending. Ideally, the euro zone should first fix the banks. That might happen at the end of the year, when the ECB completes its review of bank balance-sheets before taking over as the euro zone’s lead bank supervisor. But new rules to impose losses on creditors will not come fully into force until 2016. The single resolution mechanism to wind down banks is too legally convoluted and lacks a credible taxpayer-financed backstop. Given the “bogus” banking union, as Mr Legrain calls it, the ECB might prefer to hide problems rather than to reveal losses that countries are unable or unwilling to bear.

&gt;**Argentina—or Japan?**
German legalism is a sign of a deeper disagreement: governments want the convenience of a single currency, but not the risk-sharing and transfers of a federation. Germany rejects liability for others. It has blocked Eurobonds and a common backstop for banks. It has bailed out troubled countries through loans, but only on strict conditions. It has tightened fiscal rules and persisted in running large surpluses, worsening deflation and creating political resistance, most recently in France and Italy. And when German ministers have turned a blind eye, the Bundesbank and Karlsruhe have tried to limit risk-sharing through the ECB.

&gt;The defence of the national treasury provides exciting work for lawyers, but it makes for poor crisis-management. To work properly, a currency union needs some degree of fiscal union. Until the ECB stepped in as a lender of last resort in 2012, euro-zone countries were in effect so many Argentinas, all borrowing in a foreign currency. But unless it acts quickly to avert deflation, they could yet become latter-day Japans.",0,1397245384,null,0,false,0,cgq1hl1,t3_22sw4h,t1_cgq1hl1,t3_22sw4h,null,1433313682,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Don't get stuck like I did and do your research **early** the schools in Paris have a much more exhausting and longer application process than the schools in other cities. I barely missed the cut off for most of the major Parisian schools and I had to focus my search elsewhere in the country. 

Stay focused, do your research and everything will be fine.

Donostia (the Basque name for San Sebastian) is a splendid option, it is certainly one of the most beautiful cities in the Basque Country.

I'm sure you'll find both cities to your liking, there's plenty to do in both: museums, aquariums, quality eating, nature... I don't know what interests you the most. 

&gt;surfing in San Sebastien

Always a great experience, just be sure to check the weather forecast before, the Basque Country is very rainy! 

&gt;My wife wants to explore French Basque country, anyone have a suggestion on what town might suit us best?

The Northern Basque Country is an unspoiled treasure, it really is. And it is really less than an hour away from Donostia! I'd recommend you [Biarritz](http://www.biarritz.fr/portail/diaporama/visuel1.jpg) (great surfing as well!) and [Bayonne](http://images.france-for-visitors.com/images/supersize/bayonne.jpg), for cities, and if you want to see some small traditional Basque villages, Espelette, Sare and Ainhoa are really great, and close to both Donostia and Biarritz. If you're willing to go a bit further inland, Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port and Cambo-les-Bains are really good too.

&gt;cities in between

Rural Basque Country is beautiful, especially the coast. I'd recommend you to visit [Zarautz](http://www.laspain.com/Guipuzcoa/Zarautz_Guipuzcoa6.jpg) (very Donostia-like but smaller, and with high-quality restaurants) and the fishing towns of [Saint-Jean-de-Luz](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qGeuVBmUVNQ/UXQ_0iEgzyI/AAAAAAAAADs/53OKxkNFh3U/s1600/3166_port_saint-jean-de-luz.jpg), [Getaria](http://fotos.diariovasco.com/201010/getaria-4872.portua-eta-eliza.redes.2010-10-21-640x640x80.jpg), [Lekeitio](http://www.lekeitio.com/es-ES/PhotoGallery/GALLERY01/Im%C3%A1genes%20de%20Lekeitio/lekeitio_goitik.jpg), [Mundaka](http://mundakasurfshop.com/public_html/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Mundaka-Surf-Shop.png) is very famous for its surf-scene and waves, and it is inside the [Urdaibai park](http://www.mybilbaobizkaia.com/fitxategiak/07/turismo/Adjuntos/Imagenes/Blogs/Posts/urdaibai1.jpg) and of course, a must-see in my opinion, [Gaztelugatxe](http://www.ojodigital.com/foro/attachments/paisajes/205115d1380571621-gaztelugatxe-y-la-chica-del-paraguas-rosa-gaztelugatxechicawebod.jpg). With the exception of Saint-Jean-de-Luz, all of them are located between Donostia and Bilbao.

If you're into hiking, there are many places to go inland, so tell me if you're interested and I can name you some good places.

&gt;He didn't say he saw any evidence in these photos. It was your interpretation.

I don't know how anyone else would interpret it. If I'm talking about an even and say that I've seen photos regarding that what is claimed it is implied that there is certain evidence on those photos.

&gt;And this tape is indeed shitty propaganda

Even if true it doesn't change the contents of it - which were not spoken with intent to be ""shitty propaganda"".

&gt;Paet is a Foreign Minister of Estonia, but it doesn't make him an authority the subject, and it doesn't make him a person with some inside knowledge.

So, to believe/doubt something  you need to have experts with inside knowledge confirm it? I disagree. Doubt from people who had some insider knowledge should be enough to warrant an official or preferably independent investigation.

&gt;All he had was hearsay he collected during short visit to Ukraine on February 25.

""hearsay"" implies that it's unfounded rumor - kinda the exact opposite of what he's talking about, there are certain things that need to be investigated, doubt and (it seems certain evidence) does exist that don't support the official version of events.

Does that mean that what he heard is definitely true? No, of course not. But saying it's a 'rumor' is also not the right description.

&gt;Different events are different? You don't say.

They're not really different. ""Group of people protesting in favor of &lt;side&gt;"", according to most comments here the &lt;side&gt; is practically the only factor on which it's decided whether or not the protests are propaganda or not.

&gt;They will not be viewed the same, because they are different.

You're just confirming my point that people here view protests differently just because they're for different sides.

First of all, after the troublesome years of student protests (end of the '60s) an entire generation of teachers was made with no real skills or knowledge. I've experienced myself several 68ers, as they're often called, pretending being teachers. That, and the 20 years of belittling and dismantling of the education system begun with Berlusconi's Age of TV Success, led to several generations of people who really don't value culture or knowledge.

Several 'older' people are baffled at how ignorant younger people are, or even at how even basic texts turn out to be challenging to lots of people under 30. Culture is not cool, taking part in X-Factor is. Books? Boring, and Facebook takes enough time already.

Add to this the economic crisis, due to which entire branches of knowledge are now considered pretty much useless (literature, philosophy, history, etc.) and there you have it. People just think studying is worthless, you won't get a job anyway, so you might as well spend time doing auditions for Big Brother or whatever.

Im not saying that i agree with the coup, or the strike, or violence, or not voting, those were some massive mistakes the old powers used to find a quick way out of chavez, that just made him more radical and only willing to elect to ministries according to loyalty instead of capacity to do things.

Uno in particolare e' durato anni ed era parecchio impegnativo..
Noi lo chiamavamo ""cirulla"" anche se la cirulla e' un'altra cosa(vedi sopra).. E se qualcuno lo riconosce, plz HALP!

una partita media dura 45 min e si gioca in 5.

La base e' briscola (con A=1 e 3=3 a differenza dalla briscola) ma il gioco vero in realta' e' un giro di scommesse sul gioco di carte: dopo aver visto le proprie carte e prima di iniziare la mano si dichiara il numero di prese che si fara' nella mano successiva; se alla fine della mano si ha azzeccato si prendono 10 punti + il numero di prese dichiarate e fatte, se invece si ""sballa"" niente punti...

In prima (e ultima)mano si hanno 8 carte in mano e la briscola e' quadri.
Il numero di carte in mano diminuisce ad ogni mano (quelle inutilizzate rimangono coperte e da loro si sceglie la briscola) fino ad arrivare ad 1 carta a testa, dopodiche' si procede a risalire verso le 8 carte per un totale di 15 mani.

The Lusitania is massively overblown as a cause of US entry in WWI, they didn't join even de jure until something like two years after the incident. The actual causes of US entry into WWI were the Zimmermann telegram and the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare. 

The latter as a casus belli is self explanatory, especially for a neutral power who's trade with its biggest partners was being directly threatened. The former was a message sent to Mexico by Germany that proposed it join the Central Powers in exchange for three American border states in the event of a Central Powers victory and the US's entry on the side of the Entente. The combination of those two factors sparked waves of anti-German sentiment that led to the declaration of war a few months later.

And look who's talking mister ""I-lost-an-inbred-archduke-let's-kill-10-million-people"". The First World War was started by an extreme over-reaction to Serbian terrorism by Austria-Hungary, and most involved parties were drug into the conflict by their entangling alliances; I don't think anyone besides Russia really cared about Serbia.

&gt;parents, grandparents, and great grandparents who originally came here from...Ireland.

Ireland has a law that allows foreign-born descendants of Irish citizens to become Irish citizens (and thus EU citizens) in certain situations.

""Children born outside Ireland to Irish citizen parents

If either of your parents was an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, then you are automatically an Irish citizen, irrespective of your place of birth.

If your parent derived Irish citizenship in another manner, for example, through marriage, adoption or naturalisation, further information can be obtained from your nearest Irish embassy or consulate.

If the parent through whom you derive Irish citizenship was deceased at the time of your birth, but would have been an Irish citizen if alive at that time, you are also an Irish citizen. Also, you derive citizenship through an Irish parent whether or not your parents were married to each other at the time of your birth.

If you were born outside Ireland to an Irish citizen who was himself or herself born outside Ireland and if any of your grandparents was born in Ireland, then you are entitled to become an Irish citizen. However before you can claim Irish citizenship, you must have your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register, which is maintained by the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - see 'How to apply' below. If you are entitled to register, your Irish citizenship is effective from the date of registration - not from the date when you were born.

Citizenship through descent from Irish grandparents

If one of your grandparents is an Irish citizen but none of your parents was born in Ireland, you may become an Irish citizen. You will need to have your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register.

If you are entitled to register, your Irish citizenship is effective from the date of registration. The Irish citizenship of successive generations may be maintained in this way by each generation ensuring their registration in the Foreign Births Register before the birth of the next generation.

Since 1 July 1986, a person registered in the Foreign Births Entry Book after 1986 is deemed to be an Irish citizen only from the date of his/her entry in the Register and not from the date of birth. This means that children born to that person before his/her date of entry in the Register are not entitled to citizenship.

People registered before July 1986 are deemed Irish citizens either from the date the original Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act came into force, that is, 17 July 1956, or their date of birth, whichever is later. Only children born after 17 July 1956 can claim citizenship in such cases.""

true,atuaprima,SWIT,Switzerland,"I don't think we're in a good economy for a not-so-high-skilled person to move abroad, especially to Europe. As you may know, the EU is still suffering from the recent recession and this year will show whether the economy is getting back on its feet or not. Either way, it's gonna take some time to create net employment and grow out of the recession. Especially for non-skilled.

In Switzerland, in particular, it's even harder, I might even say impossible for a canadian. Not because of the economy, but because of regulations. You see, to work in CH and being not a native, you need a permit (to live and work), which is only granted on certain special circumstances. There are basically three levels of workers in CH: Swiss Nationals; EU-Nationals; Others. Because of the agreements with the EU, a EU-citizen applying to work in CH is placed on an equal basis related to swiss nationals (on paper; culturally, that's another matter). These people have priority when finding a job. This also means that people from Others (everywhere but EU) can only be employed and given a permit if 1) they have a job contract; and 2) the company willing to give this job contract proves that there is not a capable person to do the same job both in CH and the whole EU (basically among 500 Million people) - that's the priority rule. (Of course, it's not that rigid and there are ways around it - if you are specialist in your job, it can be proved that the job has to go to you, and there's nobody in EU who could do it instead of you. Then the company writes a form and, if the argument is accepted, the person gets a permit. Many multinationals do this to relocating staff. There are many americans and asians working in Finance, Insurance, IT, etc. on this basis.)

However, being non-highly-skilled, like you mentioned, basically means you'd probably have no chance to find a job, as those jobs are always occupied by low-skilled EU-migrants who have priority (like Portuguese, Spanish, Italians, Serbians, etc...). It is hard to prove there is no bartender or cleaning lady available to work in CH in the whole EU... Thats is why low-skilled people from outside europe are becoming rarer to see here. But you mentioned you are descendant of EU-Nationals.. do you have any EU passport? That would be a different situation, I believe.

There's also the possibility of finding the love of your life, and marrying hir/him. :p Beware, though: as soon as you divorce, the permit gets revoged and you are told to go back home.

The whole intent is to simply derail or distract the online discussion from focusing on the issue at hand. Say for instance it's about a school shooting (like in the documentary). The government employee's job would be to go in and just say things like, ""Oh yeah, what do you guys even know about that? Where are your sources?

What do you propose instead? For them to go back and work for nothing on the farms? How reliable are you?"" Then they go on to quabble about the derailed subject brought on by the government employee -- completely distracting from the fresh issue at hand.

They signed a great gas deal with Tymoshencko and got the crimean base lease extended. They will find a way to work with Ukraine because Ukraine and Russia are too interlinked. Large parts of Ukraine need Russia has an export market and it will take years to shift to other markets.

This subreddit and the entire western media is going through one massive anti-Russian circlejerk just like the one before Iraq. Russia at the end of the day cares about what is best for it's self. Putin isn't an idiot nor is he desperate. This guy for all his fault has managed to transform his country from the mess Yeltsin left. He know what he is doing. So far looking at his trackrecord. If Ukraine is run by a Pro-EU government that can't join NATO, he'll try to make as much money off Ukraine. If Ukraine is run by a Pro-Russian government, he'll be forced to help out whenever that government screws up.

The one country other than Ukraine that gains nothing from this is the US. US doesn't want to be involved in Europe. They are trying to move hardware and personnel into Asia so that they can contain China before it gets to strong. America has made a lot of promises in Asia and they are expected to keep those promises. If they end up in a stupid standoff with Russia, it gives more time for China to grow stronger and succesfully bully American allies. They can't afford to have heavy military prescence in Europe, Middle East and S.E Asia. The very last thing they need is for European countries who are unwilling to pick up the slack when it comes to military spending and have been unwilling to see through military conflicts asking for help.",0,1397258054,null,0,false,0,cgq6uex,t3_22ryjq,t1_cgq6uex,t1_cgq66d5,null,1433316273,-9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-9

true,sammy1857,null,null,"&gt; First of all - you are comparing a single man's wage to the minimum wage in the Palestinian authority. Ignoring the fact that you should be comparing it with the minimum wage in Israel as it's an Israeli company - the man is earning $2000 dollars a month when the minimum wage is 377. He's clearly a skilled labourer so the comparison is pointless. What does a similar machine operator earn in Israel? How many people are being paid below the Israeli minimum wage? What are the land taxes that he's paying as opposed to opening a factory in Israel?

The minimum wage in Israel is [$1,218$ per month](http://www.btl.gov.il/English%20Homepage/Mediniyut/GeneralInformation/Pages/MinimumWage.aspx), so he's making more than some Israeli workers, too. Even if some workers are making less than the wage cited (which we don't have proof any are), they still have potential to earn more than an Israeli.

&gt;Secondly - go ask a sweatshop worker anywhere in the world if he wants to lose his job. Obviously no matter how miserable, he will say no. They do it for survival.

Sure, but they will be miserable doing it, which these Palestinians really don't seem to be. [Watch their testimonies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl85AL1l0H0), let them speak for themselves.

&gt;“First off we need a job and an income to live -- I have a family and I need money.”

This applies anywhere- it applies to most Israeli workers, most American workers, and most Chinese workers equally. Palestinians need to have a job and an income to support their families and survive just as any person of any other nationality does. It is not evidence of anything, except perhaps the fact that this worker has good moral values that teach him he should find gainful employment to support his family, as opposed to stealing.

&gt;This man doesn't care whether it's an illegal settlement or not. The point is that the international community should care. This company opened a factory knowing that it was illegal. The fact that he has workers who are Palestinians doesn't change the fact that he is helping in their exploitation by supporting and legitimising illegal settlement building. 

1. We just established the factory is not exploiting its workers by either Palestinian or Israeli standards

2. The owner of the factory is actually a proponent of the two state solution, and tries to support Palestinian and Israeli social and economic cooperation. Again, I recommend you take a moment to [listen to these people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl85AL1l0H0) and hear what they have to say.

&gt;Palestinians are prohibited from building on the majority of Area C. A World Bank report last year estimated that the Palestinian economy could be boosted by 35 percent if development of Area C were allowed.

Yes, because administration of Area C was legally allocated to Israel under the Oslo Accords.

&gt;Moral of the story - you can't knowingly open a factory in an illegal territory and then try to take the moral high ground 

Moral of the story - you can provide hundreds of Palestinians with gainful employment they would not have otherwise gotten, a fact your business can't substantially change at the moment, in an attempt to elevate their living standards and promote cooperation, and you'll still be berated for it.",0,1397259528,null,0,false,0,cgq7eif,t3_22riyu,t1_cgq7eif,t1_cgq6ot7,null,1433316536,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

How does that change what the Palestinians are going through? If 50% of Americans were against the Iraq war, would that stop or excuse the killing? 

And yes, they pay Palestinians more than they would be getting elsewhere. But not as much as Israelis. There's an economic benefit to it obviously, or they wouldn't bother. But there's an entire area called Area C that Palestinians are prohibited from building in because of these settlements. The World Bank estimates the Palestinian economy would be boosted by 30% if they were allowed to build there. So yes, the factory pays more to those workers. But no, the Palestinians as a whole would be infinitely better off without those settlements. 



&gt;Think about it: if Sodastream goes bankrupt, who suffers most as a result? The handful of Israeli entrepreneurs who are still worth millions? Or the hundreds of Palestinians who made five times what their neighbors did and who now have to join the massive ranks of the unemployed?

If Sodastream moves its factory those Palestinians working for them will suffer. But the Palestinians as a whole will get one step closer to ending the settlements and boosting their own economy on their own land. 

I find this whole line of thinking absurd. ""Yes it's illegal, but it helps a tiny fraction of Palestinians even though the whole system is illegal. So instead of targeting the system we should let it pass""

Am I a Russian shill? 


On a side note whenever i want to comment on someones message, first thing i do is check his posting history. There are quite a few individuals in this subreddit who is loaded with an agenda or special interests. I don't know if they are ""ideological warriors who just fight the good fight for their ideals"" or just simply paid to do so, but i do know that posting the same stuff over and over again requires time and effort. Being the lazy bastard i am, i wonder why do people continue to do so and how come they never even try to present something different to the table.


Unfortunately i cannot give you an insight on Russian media comment sections, mostly because i never bother to read nor Russian media, nor comments, but i am sure they are at least Youtube ""quality"". 

Does astroturfing exists - yes, is Russia actively engaged in such activities - quite likely, is everyone who disagrees with established narrative/hive mind (which is quite often formed my media outlets) is a Russian paid shill - doubtful.

But to the point. 1: The US has no desire to station troops in Ukraine. This entire situation is viewed as a mess in America, and there's no consolidated opinion on the matter, but it's agreed pretty much everywhere that we aren't interested in fighting in Ukraine. 

2: There isn't much risk of their being military conflict with Germany or Japan, but there most certainly *is* a risk of military conflict *in* those countries or in their immediate areas. Japan has standing conflicts with both North Korea and China, and the US is obligated to come to their defense in the event of conflict. The bases in Germany wre more pressing during the Cold War, when the Iron Curtain came down in the middle of the country, but they still fulfill the same purpose today; keeping Russia at bay. Seeing as Russia *just* annexed the territory of a sovereign nation in the region, it's probably a wise decision. Various NATO members in eastern Europe have called for aid, and Germany would probably be the staging ground before heading further east.

Yes it has. I already mentioned that it hampers America's ability to move to Asia. It's a waste of time and resources. Russia isn't going to invade a NATO country, that is WW3. However America is being forced to reassure NATO countries. They are devoting precious resources and attention to this issue when they would prefer not to. Meanwhile China is still getting stronger and stronger. This also shows that Russia is more likely to react strongly with diplomatic fallout if the US is caught trying to topple lets say the Belarusian government or the Kazakhstani one.

&gt;This whole thing has actually been incredibly great for America, since it restored whatever weakness the NSA scandal had created in its relationship with Europe, the entire world (with what, 11 exceptions?) now sees Russia as the bad guys, eastern European countries (and Germany) who were starting to court Russia and join in on the Ostpolitik are now calling for US bases to be set up in their territory, and there is going to be significant foreign investment in US natural gas export terminals.

Not it hasn't. The relationships of countries aren't based on single issues. The US-Europe ties were never going to be harmed by NSA. We need each other to much, however it damages ties when it comes to security and privacy issues. Just because tensions with Russia are up doesn't mean that Europeans are suddenly going to forget that Merkel was spied upon. The damage from that still exists and will continue to fester. Also I already mentioned, America doesn't neeed bases in Europe. It's only European countries who benefit from that. They get to keep their spending low and avoid military conflicts while America picks up the slack. Meanwhile America's long term interest aka containing China becomes more difficult and expensive. This thing with Russia is a distraction. The gravity of world politics is moving away from the Atlantic to the Indian and Pacific ocean. Germany, Russia, UK and France will just be former has beens compared to China, Indonesia and India. The American government wants to keep up with international developments, not relive the cold war.


Oh and don't buy the crap about China disliking the event in Ukraine. I've seen some pretty delusional stuff about how Russia has pissed of it's central asian allies, India or China. Let me reiterate, it's pretty delusional. The Chinese media may be hating on Russia but not the Chinese government. The only country that is slightly worried is Azerbajian just incase the Armenians pull the Crimean stunt on the NK.

&gt;and caused Russia to go into recession... all completely on accident, without even trying.

The Russian economy has been slightly weak before the current crisis and this only pushes it further down. However Russia is more than able to handle it. Putin and Medvedev proved themselves during the last financial crisis. Plus Russia is opening pipelines to China. China since it's poorer than Europe will pay less, however they are a market that is growing very fast. Faster than the already developed Europe. Russia is in a good position financially to deal with this, I don't see why your so happy. Their finances are better than ours is and we're supposed to be in our 4th year of austerity.


&gt;Honestly if this had worked out differently and the Kremlin had no gone insane and nationalistic, I would have expected this whole thing to be orchestrated by the US for its own benefit. Only since then, Russia elevated it to the current position and I doubt Putin is a CIA mole.


This is the biggest issue out of all them. Just because someone is doing something that you really don't want them to, doesn't mean they are crazy or insane.

No, he's picking a fight from a weak position against much stronger players. Russia's economy is 1/10th the size of the United States and the EU, and is funded mostly by oil sales which is both a finite business and a commodity that looks likely to become much cheaper. Even though they know that it is a fatal flaw in the economy, oil continues to gain as a percentage of economic output. Russia's small business community is collapsing because Putin is pathologically obsessed with stamping out dissent which has caused the creative class that fuels entrepreneurship to flee abroad. Ultimately the US and EU (and just the US if needs be) can bring to bear an enormous amount of power and resources against Russia if it decides to do so. The only thing holding it back is the post-Cold War era order of things which while giving it a paramount spot also restrains its activities. Putin is trying to change the rules Russia operates under, but the US (and the EU)can do the same thing with far more resources and people. Russian men have a life expectancy of 64 years and their population is at best leveling out but most likely shrinking. Of all the current larger powers in the world, the US is right behind India in the order for expected population growth. Eventually everything he is trying to paper over with aggression and authoritarianism will collapse. You know the West goes through periods of malaise while dealing structural problems in their society and economy. Russia undergoes a total collapse every time because they ignore structural deficiencies for so long that they completely destroy the system.

Obviously the best thing for Russia to do would be to align closer to the EU, let their ""sphere of influence"" idea die, and start to build an economy that encourages small business growth and entrepreneurship.

No, it means that you're able to create a model through which Israeli and Palestinian economic cooperation can increase, and which may steadilyd expand into the administrative and executive levels, fostering greater economic development not only within the territories, but between people of opposing nationalities. This, in turn, will help further interlink the Israeli and Palestinian economies, incentivizing diplomatic resolution and discouraging clashes, which will financially hurt both Palestinians and Israelis.

And again, Sodastream is not exploiting its workers.

&gt;Are you saying no illegal wage under cutting occurs?

No, but that can occur whether the employers are Palestinian or Israeli. At least with an Israeli employer, the Palestinians can petition the ministry of labor to get their employer to follow regulations.

&gt; Is that a joke? If someone asks you about your job on TV you are not going to be negative if you want to keep your job. 

No, but I think it would be a bit obvious if the entire factory were lying through their teeth. But in interview after interview, and video after video, the majority of the workers seem to honestly be okay with their job. Again, I don't see why they wouldn't be. They are being paid high wages and have good benefits, like any other employees.

I do think think Russian intelligence is that ruthless, Viktor Bout proves they are willing to take big gambles. Bout was brought into the Russian intelligence hierarchy in 2005 so when he met with the FARC[DEA agents] in 2008 he was working under the authority of the Russian intelligence services(even if he never got permission specifically for this). 

&gt; Eventually, the fake FARC members managed to arrange a face-to-face meeting with Bout in Bangkok, Thailand. There, they told Bout they required weapons for the explicit purpose of shooting down U.S. aircraft assisting the Colombian military in counter-narcotics operations. “We're fighting against the United States,” they told him, to which Bout responded “we are together in this … they are my enemy also.”

Since he was known for never over promising what he could deliver, it seems unlikely that he would have promised to deliver surface to air missile which he would have had to acquire from the Russian military, without something that assured him the Russian government would follow through. Honestly even though the Russian government protests his arrest, they are lucky that it was a sting operation and nobody ever shot down American airplanes with weapons he supplied. If the Russian military/intelligence nexus is willing to risk some sort of American military retaliation, then I have no idea how far they would go with former Soviet states.

Since the US is seen as a symbol of liberalism, capitalism and consumerism, it's easy to see why it would be so hated here. I'm not sure if there's anything else but this seems to me to be enough to explain it.

There's also something in ex-Yu countries called [yugonostalgia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugo-nostalgia), and I'm sure other eastern countries have similar phenomenons, which would then again perpetuate the communist world-view and hence anti-Americanism.

Your ticket will include the platform you'll arrive and the platform where to get your next train. Unlike other rail systems, Germany seems to be able to know this month' ahead. 
If you still miss your connection, no worries. Walk to the Deutsche Bahn office in the station and ask for a new connection.

È stata pubblicata una review sistematica che prende in considerazione dati finora non pubblicati. La presenza di dati non pubblicati ha fatto sì che le precedenti review in merito a questo fossero incomplete - cioè, c'era un ""publication bias"", una distorsione creata dal fatto che solo alcuni dati erano pubblicati e quindi analizzati.

Volendo essere precisi, il farmaco non è *inutile*; però i suoi benefici sono talmente marginali che non giustificano il suo impiego. Il farmaco riduce lievemente la durata dei sintomi (mezza giornata; praticamente è come non prenderlo) e riduce lievemente il rischio di contrarre l'influenza se assunto preventivamente. Non riduce in maniera statisticamente significativa il rischio di essere ospedalizzati o di sviluppare complicanze.

Questi dati non sono completamente affidabili a causa di varii problemi nei trial, ma sono il meglio che abbiamo.

Detto questo, il fatto che il farmaco sia inutile è venuto fuori (come in casi precedenti, es. reboxetina) grazie al fatto che vengono fatti trial sui farmaci e la loro efficacia viene continuamente messa alla prova dalla medicina moderna. Il fatto che non venga dimostrata l'efficacia di un farmaco non significa che *tutti* i farmaci siano da buttare, né significa che tutte le industrie farmaceutiche mettano in commercio farmaci inefficaci.

Bad part (for us) is that they adapt, learn and improve from spam. This software is extremely sophisticated and  it's translation module is very good. We are speaking about ""better then google translate"" good. Seriously. They have done great work there. Too bad they use it for propaganda. I would love to see how they solved all those problems :).

For example first their messages were very easy to find out because they made typical russicism in their Estonian language and they often used some random Estonian first name for commenter name. Thing is, before that, in 20 years, it was extremely rare that someone used common firstname as comment nick. They changed that behavior now as it was good give-away. It was down to the point where people just downvoted every comment with first name as nick.

Basically when you are German you would see that all the cool names like ithisa and Mantonization are replaced with Kurt and Hans.

Second thing you may notice is that they use typical soviet demagogic patterns. Whataboutism is very common.

Third, usually you know people around you, you know how your people think and what they write. Then suddenly out of blue, comments change and votes change. This is really noticeable as people do not change they worldviews as quick. Suddenly forum is flooded by weird pro-russian comments and you start to ask yourself ""why I never noticed before that we had so many people who think like that?"", well you did not.

Fourth, more controversial comments get huge amount of up and downvotes. Before it was usually very lopsided. Comments got like 1000+ votes and 100- votes or other way. After change there were pro-russian comments with 1000+ votes and 1000- votes. They also do it pretty well, they do not Flood votes, they just make sure to + vote enough to get small margin as it is less visible.

The non regional trains are mainly the ICs (InterCity trains) and the ICEs (InterCity Express trains). These cost more. When you buy a ticket you buy the fare, but not a seat reservation. Seat reservations are 4€ extra if I recall correctly. So if you find yourself with some sort of rail pass that lets you take an IC or an ICE and if you are a person who has to have a seat (lots of people are happy to take their chances to find an empty seat or sit on the floor or in the restaurant car), then buy a reservation. You can book a seat reservation separate from your ticket online. Generally no seat reservations on regional trains. 

Most of the cities in Germany have their own tariff area within their greater city area Hamburg, for example, has the HVV). If you take a regional train in Hamburg, a Metronom, for example, is the name of a regional train company that has a partnership with Deutsche Bahn but is not actually Deutsche Bahn, you could be sitting on a Metronom train in Hamburg and the person to your right and the person to your left and you could all have different tickets from different companies and be on the same train: Deutsche Bahn, Metronom, and HVV. The choices can be overwhelming. Don't worry too much about it. If you use the bahn.de website, however, and you are trying to get a ticket and you can't buy one online it might be because DB reports almost all timetables for trains, but they can't always sell tickets for all of the trains.

Just remeber to keep the blood and the heads, when the Conductors come *they* will demand to be appeased. Also you will need the blood when DB Security comes. Here is a nice quick guide on drawing a protection circle with blood (www.Deutsche-Bahn.de/Schutzzirkel).

Ad esempio, mettiamo che tu abbia asso e re di spade e sia il tuo seme migliore. Chiameresti il 3 di spade e chi ha quella carta giocherebbe con te.
A questo punto devi pensare a quanti punti potreste realisticamente fare e fissarlo come tuo limite massimo per l'asta.
Ci sono ovviamente altri fattori, tipo quanti carichi hai. 
Anche il modo in cui gli altri partecipano all'asta ti da un'idea di come siano distribuite le carte.

Inoltre puoi chiamarti in mano o ""in braghe"" che vuol dire chiamare una carta che tu stesso hai. In quel caso i punti che si assegnano a chi vince raddoppiano.

&gt;__Port of Vigo__ ([Galician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_language): *Porto de Vigo*, [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language): *Puerto de Vigo*) located in [Vigo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigo), [Pontevedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontevedra_(province\)), [Galicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Spain\)), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain) is the biggest [fishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing) [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port) in the world   and one of the busiest in transportation. It is also home of the world's largest fishing company, [Pescanova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pescanova). In 2008, unloaded fish reached 751,971 tonnes.

&gt;Vigo is the base for the big fishing companies which have prominent presence in countries such [Namibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia), [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa), [Mozambique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia), [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina), the [Falkland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands), [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile) and [Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru), among others. Fish is sent all over Spain and abroad to countries like Portugal, Italy, France and other more distant markets including Asia.

&gt;In Vigo, important international trade fairs are held, like Conxemar, an annual event dedicated to frozen fish products. The [World Fishing Exhibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Fishing_Exhibition) takes place periodically.

He isn't. The whole article is ""a member of congress said"" and ""a member of the staff said"" this and that about what Breedlove said. Some classified briefings are quoted as well, which the author clearly didn't attend. There's also something from a written testimony to congress that was not delivered.

The only thing coming directly from the man's mouth is nothing like the rest of the article:

&gt;In a statement for The Daily Beast, Breedlove acknowledged that he met with members of both parties in Congress in the last week in March. “**I provided my estimation of Russian capabilities and that estimation was well-received by the Members. As these sessions were classified, I can only get into generalities.**” Breedlove added that he discussed a number of issues including the U.S. consideration of non-lethal aid to Ukraine. “**I was clear that our efforts were aimed at reassuring our NATO Allies and European partners of our commitment and resolve**,” he said.",0,1397298335,null,0,false,0,cgqhxxc,t3_22spfo,t1_cgqhxxc,t1_cgq3wac,null,1433321568,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

That's Manichaeism right there, once again: shining a light on the good guys vs the bad guys. That's bullshit.

To us, every country has internal issues to resolve; to you, you like to meddle in every country with issues. The conflict in Ukraine should not be an oportunity to profit and play military. It's an opportunity to raise options on the table and let them decide. ON THEIR OWN. Can you cope with democracy, when it's not leaned towards Western interests? We can. We have tons of countries not adherent to EU and NATO on our backdoor and, you know what, it's fine.

I'm actually glad China is becoming a new world power in global geopolitics. I don't care if they're communists or state capitalists or whatever. As long as they steal part of the decision making from the US, who acts like a spoiled single child at every occasion, then it is worth it.

&gt;We allotted the most time to Donostia, as our main focus for the trip is cuisine, and I'm sure we will not be disappointed. Can you recommend any lunch and/or dinner places in Donostia?

Donostia is recognized in a European level for its gastronomy, so I'm sure you won't be disappointed. It is the Basque capital of good eating, from small pintxos (Basque version of Spanish tapas) in local bars to high-end restaurants. There are many bars (some of them of very high standards) through the old town, and they're very well known for their pintxos, be sure to check that out. 

The most famous restaurants in Donostia are [Akelaŕe](http://www.akelarre.net/public_home/ctrl_home.php), [Arzak](http://www.arzak.info/index.html), [Martín Berasategui](http://www.martinberasategui.com/es/inicio) and [Mugaritz](http://www.mugaritz.com/), they can be quite expensive and you need to make a reservation (sometimes there are even waiting lists), but you really don't need to go to those to experience some great gastronomy in the city. I'd recommend you to visit the [official tourism website of the city](http://www.sansebastianturismo.com/en/eat/where-to-eat) for more info. The [Basque Culinary Center](http://www.bculinary.com/en/home) is a good option to see (and taste) experimental dishes, and some other wonders.

&gt;I believe I have heard Zarautz mentioned as a surfing town. Is it worthwhile to travel there for the restaurants alone?

I would say so. I mean, it is like a miniature version of Donostia, but with a very own identity. And it has a bunch of very famous restaurants (and of course, the beach). [You can find more info here](http://www.turismozarautz.com/turismozarautz/dm/gastronomy.asp?nombre=2410&amp;hoja=0&amp;sesion=1347). 

If you're really into surfing, I'd recommend you again the Urdaibai area, especially [Mundaka](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGHkL6Pwhio/S7RcliFYjtI/AAAAAAAAEMA/jXS1TdrUdGE/s1600/IMG_9821_4.JPG). It is considered one of the best surfing-spots in northern Spain.

Sometimes misparses the English, but it gives you options to pick from (which parse should I choose) when it gets confused.

Also, between certain languages Google Translate goes through English first. This is almost always a really bad choice (English is notoriously hard to understand for computers).

L'articolo de Linkiesta non cambia di un epsilon il discorso, continua a confermare che si tratta di una sentenza demenziale. Quando dice:

&gt; «i terremoti non si possono prevedere, e questo lo si è già dato per acquisito». Il punto è invece che «ciò che agli imputati era richiesto, per legge, era l’analisi del rischio e una corretta informazione». In pratica, per farla breve, si sono spesi troppo nel tranquilizzare la popolazione.  

si sta contraddicendo immediatamente. Tranquillizzare la popolazione, anche con la famigerata ""operazione mediatica"" di Bertolaso, era esattamente quello che devi fare.

Questo perchè quando si dice (come dicono tutti gli accecati dall'odio verso Boschi e Bertolaso, che non stanno simpatici neanche a me):
&gt;, tra dire ""Non lo sappiamo"" o ""Non c'è pericolo"", c'è un'enorme differenza.

si ignora completamente la statistica degli eventi tra cui si sceglie. Se mi chiedi: ""Domani potrebbe arrivare Cthulhu in tutù rosa a distruggere Milano"", la risposta *formalmente corretta* è ""non lo so"". Anche alla domanda ""domani sorgerà il sole?"" la risposta formalmente corretta è *non lo so*. A praticamente qualsiasi domanda che non sia un teorema della matematica, quella è e resta la risposta corretta.

Quello che diamo invece di norma sono le risposte statisticamente più attendibili. Se chiedi alla Protezione Civile o a degli astronomi di dirti se domani un asteroide di 10 km crollerà sulla Torre di Pisa, non ti devono rispondere ""boh, chi lo sa, forse che sì forse che no"". Ti devono rispondere ""guarda, no."" Qualsiasi altra affermazione scatena il *panico* nella popolazione, e il panico invece quasi certamente creerà danni (economici soltanto se va bene, alle persone se va peggio). 

Idem in questo caso. Quando c'è un rischio improbabile e imprevedibile, la cosa migliore è sempre ridurre il panico e tranquillizzare, perchè statisticamente ha l'outcome migliore. 

Quindi per quanto mi riguarda costoro hanno fatto *benissimo* il loro lavoro, e se invece lo Stato gli chiedeva di indurre il panico nella popolazione, era lo Stato a sbagliare. Li difendo perchè hanno preso una decisione scientificamente e mediaticamente correttissima, e sono stati crocifissi solo a causa del senno di poi.",0,1397308710,null,0,false,0,cgqjp5z,t3_22oify,t1_cgqjp5z,t1_cgqgpuw,null,1433322462,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

Allerdings ist es real so, dass sich bei weitem nicht jeder Vegetarier/Veganer so intensiv mit den diskursiven Spezifika der moraltheoretischen Debatte auseinandersetzt.

Tierhaltung und ihre Folgen verursachen mindestens 32,6 Milliarden Tonnen CO2 pro Jahr, und insgesamt etwa 51% der weltweiten Treibhausgase ([Quelle](http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6294)).

Hinzu kommen die desaströsen Auswirkungen von Fleischkonsum auf den weltweiten Wasserhaushalt, Biodiversität und Lebensmittelproduktivität ([Quelle](http://www.worldwatch.org/node/549)). 

Fleisch (und andere Tierprodukte) zu konsumieren ist völliger Unsinn, wenn man auch nur am Rande daran interessiert ist, Weltprobleme wie Hunger und Umweltzerstörung mitzulösen. Zudem ist es, ganz egoistisch gesehen, viel einfacher gesund zu leben, schlank zu bleiben und leistungsfähig zu sein.

Je pense pas.

&gt; Combien de temps ça a duré

J'ai fait ca, 4-5 jours, le temps de faire une dizaine de temples.

&gt; As-tu des conseils sur la préparation d'un tel pélerinage ?

Yep. Renseigne toi sur:

* le climat de l'endroit et prévois ton équipement en rapport
* le logement. Perso j'ai fait ça à l'arrache et tant qu'il fait noir et sans trop de bruit, je dors n'importe où.
* sur internet sur les gens qui ont fait le même pèlerinage que celui que tu veux faire.

Après:

* voyage léger
* chausse-toi bien
* prévois de l'eau
* trousse à pharmacie, lunette de soleil, crème solaire
* si c'est dans un pays où tu ne parles pas la langue, un guide de conversation c'est pas du luxe

&gt;Au final ça t'a apporté quoi ?

* des supers histoires à raconter en soirées
* un ou deux coups de soleil
* des rencontres improbables: un moine bouddhiste guide des pèlerinages de St Compostelle, un vieux japonais qui parlait couramment français et avec qui j'ai taillé le bout de gras sur l'éloge de l'ombre, un vieux garçon tout bourré qui m'invitait à passer la nuit chez lui et ses vieux, la veuve d'un célèbre procureur qui me filait des conseils sur la vie, etc. 

Je pense que cela apporte beaucoup (your experience may vary). Plusieurs raisons à ça: tu es coupé de tout, tu es seul, et tu as beaucoup de temps.

**Retrospective Liars** 

When people began to question the [unities of Aristotle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_unities) in France and others consequently also defended them, there was once more to be seen that which has been seen so often, but seen so unwillingly: 

people lied to themselves about the reasons why the laws ought to exist, merely for the sake of not acknowledging to themselves that they had accustomed themselves to the authority of those laws and  did no longer want things to be any different. 

And so it is done in every prevailing morality or religion and has always be done that way: the reasons and intentions behind the habit, are only lied into existence when people begin to question the habit, and ask for reasons and intentions. Here, the great dishonesty of the conservatives reveals itself: - they are retrospective liars.

[translation note: ""Retrospective Liar"" is my coinage of ""Hinzulügner"" which consists of ""hinzu"" and ""liar"".

""hinzu"" normally means something like ""on-top"", but can also mean ""as an afterthought"", which seems to be the meaning Nietzsche is going for here ]

If that fails with some individuals who manage to cross the patrols and soldiers they should probably be placed in detention centers where they will obviously have to do some work so they aren't fed by the Italian taxpayer.

I am sure we will have a few sit-down meals, but they would likely be mid-range as far as price goes.  Do you have any tips or choosing a restaurant?  I would be sure almost any of them are tremendous, but if you don't have any specific suggestions, are there any helpful tips on choosing a place?

Any can't miss dishes?  I am a huge fan of game meats, and meat in general.  My wife is primarily vegetarian, but is sensible enough to not miss out on a bite of a great dish.  We are also looking forward to the seafood, as we are 400 miles inland at home.

I paesi germanici e centro-europei hanno pochi laureati, invece quelli latini tanti, per via del diverso sistema educativo. 

Nei paesi centro-europei oltre alle scuole tecniche stile italia ci sono gli apprendistati, per cui uno studia e lavora e impara una professione specifica per cui riceve un diploma, e può poi comunque ottenere una maturità professionale. 
Ci sono anche le università professionali che sono orientate più a dare una formazione professionale in 3 anni e sono orientate a chi vuole continuare gli studi dopo un'educazione secondaria professionale, rispetto alle università tradizionali che sono pensate per chi prima ha fatto il liceo e non sa fare nulla ma è forte nelle materie teoriche e si può quindi mettere l'asticella in alto. 
Invece in italia o università o niente, e chi ha fatto la scuola professionale e magari è semplicemente meno bravo a studiare di un liceale sbatte contro un muro. 

Il problema dell'italia è che adotta il sistema latino ma ha percentuali di laureati addirittura più basse dei paesi centro-europei. 

Come dice JaviG, poi si creano quegli squilibri: se l'unico modo di diventare un muratore abile è attraverso un percorso professionale informale (tanto per iniziare devi averlo il lavoro giusto con qualcuno disposto ad addestrare), è chiaro che poi c'è una carenza. 

Questo modo di fare mi sembra sia un problema anche negli USA (con l'aggravante dell'indebitamento degli studenti che studiano roba inutile). 

Andrebbero dati più soldi all'educazione secondaria superiore e flessibilizzata quella terziaria. ",0,1397315651,null,0,1397316534,0,cgqlmoi,t3_22t2ua,t1_cgqlmoi,t3_22t2ua,null,1433323372,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

I don't see what you buy at a Pakistani shop, why you eat kebab that's bad for you and having mosques which propagate Islam which is overall the most backwards religion.

But whatever. Suum cuique. Let's make an economic example.

Let's assume I make 2500 Euros a month. As you probably know in Italy it's pretty acceptable that the state takes about 1000 of these Euros from me via taxes. Now, an immigrant costs the state around the 30 Euros a month. Further you can make the very very simple calculations how much illegal immigrants eat from my money. So I pay for these people.

But is that the only problem? No, of course not. It is an accepted fact that immigrants, wherever they go, wherever from, bring crime to the country. Europeans aren't an exception. Italians and Irish people brought crime in the US in the beginning of the last century. So this is what immigrants are doing now. 

So if that is not reason enough to stop illegal immigration, I don't know what is.

As for being lucky-the success of European countries has nothing to do with luck. It's a lot of hard work over many centuries. You are not lucky to live in a nice country. You ancestors worked hard for it.

So, for me, I think it's worth kind of embracing the nationalism and becoming used to it, **but** making sure that nationalism is observed in the *right way*. That this nationalism promotes peace, learning, respect and so on. Earlier forms of German and other kinds of European nationalism focused on things like being physically strong, having powerful military capabilities, being stronger and able to crush other cultures, et cetera.

Il est possible que tes ""points"" soient identiques sans que ce soit toi. Le cas le plus évident c'est les jumeaux, mais ça peut être une mutation, ou juste la faute à pas de chance. A partir de là, c'est purement des statistiques et des probabilités, la chance qu'on trouve une personne qui correspondent mais qui ne soit pas le criminel est très faible, de l'ordre du 0.00...1%. Mais ça n'est pas 0.
Et les probas sont très compliquées à visualiser pour une personne (même quand on comprend les maths derrière), du coup quand on voit autant de 0 derrière la virgule on se dit qu'en réalité ça ne peut jamais arriver , mais si.

C'est pour ça qu'un test d'adn pour indemniser quelqu'un (prouver qu'il n'est pas coupable) est fiable, si tu ne correspond pas c'est pas toi, mais pour prouver la culpabilité il faut corroborer avec autre chose. Quand tu limites ton test adn aux ""500 personnes sur les lieux du crime"", la probabilité qu'un corresponde par erreur est encore plus faible et donc plus fiable.

Idem, si tu as 10 personnes et que tu es certains que l'une d'entre elle a commis le crime, si une seule d'entre elle à un adn qui correspond c'est fiable. Mais c'est parce que tu as d'autres éléments pour limiter en plus de l'adn.

Mon message n'était pas tellement que les tests adn en général font mettre des tas d'innocents en prison, ça n'est pas le cas du tout, mais plutôt que j'aimerai qu'une fois de temps en temps on insiste sur le fonctionnement de ces tests parce que cet aspect semble complètement ignoré de tout le monde et les gens ont de nos jours une vision du test adn qui ne correspond pas du tout à la réalité.

Tiens un exemple simple: si tu fais un test adn de paternité, on te dira tout de suite que c'est pas fiable à 100%, même si les chance d'erreurs sont faibles. Premier lien google pour illustrer: http://www.dna-geneticconnections.com/dna_accuracy.html

&gt; no man will ever be 100% included as the biological father because there is always the slight possibility that the DNA profile of the alleged father matches the DNA profile of the child by mere chance. The likelihood of this happening is usually well below 0.001% (1 in 100,000)
&gt;For paternity cases, if the alleged father is not the biological father, the result will be 100% exclusion. However, if the alleged father cannot be excluded as the biological father, the result will be a certain percent inclusion. Make sure you look for a lab that routinely provides at least 99.99% probability of inclusion.

Comme ils le disent ""si on te dis que tu n'es pas le père, tu peux en être sur à 100%, mais si on te dit que tu es le père, ça sera uniquement un pourcentage de probabilité proche de 99.99%, et il y aura toujours une chance que tu test positif par erreur"".

Question bonus: ""eh mais, pourquoi on en test pas directement 100 ou 200 de tes locus là, comme ça on sera sur"". Parce que un c'est plus long, donc plus cher, et deux, tu augmente les chances de ratés.

La filosofia in generale come disciplina è aperta alla trasformazione fattuale, perchè è inerentemente umana, ma quando la tua filosofia è dettata da un essere onnipotente, allora per cambiarla devi affidarti o all'imposizione (condanna di eresia), o all'ignoranza (quanti sanno, per esempio, che il concetto dell'immacolata concezione è stato inventato solo 150 anni fa?)

The Nazis were quite comfortable and consistent with who they were and had big plans. Another Gandhi quote:

&gt;The calculated violence of Hitler may even result in a general massacre of the Jews by way of his first answer to the declaration of such hostilities. But if the Jewish mind could be prepared for voluntary suffering, even the massacre I have imagined could be turned into a day of thanksgiving and joy that Jehovah had wrought deliverance of the race even at the hands of the tyrant. For to the god fearing, death has no terror. It is a joyful sleep to be followed by a waking that would be all the more refreshing for the long sleep.

When one of the most insistent and brilliant pacifists ever is advocating voluntarily accepting the final solution and turning it into a ""day of thanksgiving and joy"" because god, I want at least one warhawk in my foreign policy team, thanks. Of course Ghandi was more complex than this, and at other times expressed resorting to arms when absolutely all else fails. But to me that's accepting that no matter how pacifist your ideals are and how much you are willing to give up for them, you might need a hawk someday.

But I can only say that about my country. Shit is probably different in other countries of Europe. Like in places where legal purchase age is 16.

I am not proud that my grandma takes a pension of 1000 Euros or so while a bunch of free loaders take the money I pay for taxes. Italy was established for Italians. It's the land of Italians.

Why are countries created? Let's talk about Rousseau's social contract. The citizens of a country give away their freedom and money so a government can provide for their needs and defend them. Basically, a country is a structure that is there for the sole reason to serve the interests of it's people, to keep the people save, and those people's culture alive and well.

Giving social benefits to immigrants is completely illogical. It it not beneficial for the Italian people. No, it takes away their money and gives it to others. It also introduces crime, thus is not defending those citizens physically. So, accepting illegal immigration is absolutely against the social contract and pretty much defeats the reason of there being a country in the first place. Europe is also providing for a form of social contract but this time for a whole continent. So we can all benefit.

In the end everything is economy. Germany helps Greece, so in time Greece can help Germany and make them money and vice-versa. It is irrelevant as it is an economic relationship that benefits all. Illegal immigration only benefits illegal immigrants. It is betraying the interests of Italian people. Simple as that.

Why would we accept that challenge? They come here, they are the ones who should either integrate or leave.

Note that we are talking about illegal immigration, not all immigration. Legal immigration(unless the laws are stupid like in Sweden) is good for the country and helps the Italians as well as the immigrants. If you are highly skilled and a good contribution to Italy, you're welcome. If not, your place is not here.

In conclusion: Accepting illegal immigrants is betraying the interests of the Italian people, it is ignoring the simple laws of economics and it is overall horrible for the local culture. It defeats the purpose of there being an Italy and not a bunch of villages on a peninsula in the first place.

Donc, soit on considère qu'il y a 500 lycéens garçons, et qu'ils sont absolument tous suspects, auquel cas on les fout tous en garde à vue, on les passe tous à l'interrogatoire pour voir si leurs circonstances tiennent la route, et on peut même tous les mettre en détention préventive, pour en faire craquer un ou deux. 

Mais à ce compte là, il faut se demander pourquoi ça serait forcément un lycéen présent ce jour là ? Pourquoi pas un pote d'un lycéen qui vient souvent, ou encore un ancien élève, ou bien une femme avec un godemichet comme dans Nip/Tuck, ou même Julien Coupat ou Dominique Baudis, qui sont ou ont été tous les deux suspects sur d'autres affaires d'ailleurs (il n'y a jamais de fumée sans feu ma bonne dame). Donc pourquoi ne pas étendre la recherche à tous les Français ? 

Soit on considère qu'aucun n'est suspect, et ben tant pis. La justice, ce n'est pas recherche absolue de la vengeance et d'un coupable quoi qu'il arrive. C'est censé être la recherche de la vérité sans enfreindre les libertés individuelles. 

Pour moi, ce n'est pas un nombre qui fixe la limite, c'est plutôt de savoir si la personne est réellement suspectée ou pas.

true,DivideEtImpera8,ITAL,Italy,"There is no such things as ethics. Ethics is a man-made concept that changes very rapidly and very often. Economy is in the basis of species existing, humans have just taken it to the next level. Animals have a type of cooperation to survive. Wolves eat the week deer. The deer population keeps he fit genes, and there are as many deer as the nature can feed. And wolves have full bellies. Even in a preadator-pray condition it's still economy.

And you see this is the kind of thing that bothers me with taxes. For example, Italy gives money to the Vatican. And religious people are probably happy about it. Just like Italy gives money to immigrants and people like yourself are happy about it. I, on the other hand, would not like to pay for neither of these things.

The state is not a leech that sucks your earning and that is why I spoke of Rousseau. The basic of his work has started before Ancient Egypt and has stayed unchanged until today. The idea of a state is that. **The citizen gives part his personal freedom and part of his wealth in exchange for the protection of his life and favors the state produces for the money**. Basically. if we ignore the freedom/protection part(which is important but irrelevant to our discussion) you get money for services. Now as I pay taxes, I expect that the government to create and keep infrastructure, health care, sustain an army and so on and so forward. Therefore i pay for services. That is why it is a social contract-just like the contract you have with a person who sells you something-you give the money and he the favor. 

And this is where illegal immigrants come into play. The favors I pay for taxes should be beneficial to me. I hope you understand that. The moment the government spends money on an immigrant, this no longer  benefits me-it does the opposite. They take my money in exchange for no favor. Any money you give and don't get anything back is charity. Basically, the government giving my money to immigrants, means the government is starting a charity on my name without my approval, therefore braking the trust circle government-citizen. Simply put, this is theft I didn't sign up for.

&gt;How is accepting immigrants destroying the idea of our country?

Because it is braking the social contract. It is no longer beneficial for me. Without that social contract the country is an useless entity. Simple as that.

As for people coming here. Thankfully Italy is not one of the counties lacking brain resource. We are one of the few Western countries who have enough doctors for example. combined with unemployment we are a country that is currently in zero need of immigration. Also, I know a Romanian who finished law school in Romania but if he stays there his salary, for the same education, will be half of the salary he'll get in Italy for the same thing. So that's a reason to come. But that is a little off topic.

Again, economically and socially illegal immigrants are a burden and you can't deny that without sounding stupid. No offense.

I know a few immigrants, I have the honor to call some of them my friends although those who are my friends are all Eastern European immigrants. I know a guy from Morocco. He sells stuff on the streets. He doesn't pay taxes. He and other 7 immigrants live in an apartment like savages. He sends all of his money to his family in Morocco. He's also not a bad person. He is not a bad person, but he is a person without whom Italy would be a better place. He's a good guy but he's a social parasite. And that's that. We have to think of our interests as a nation. You're a Lombard. You know Italy has a hard time being a nation. A Venetian and a Sicillian are people from two different worlds. Putting more in the mix can't bring any good.

A proposito di espedienti estremi dei procacciatori di contratti mi è stato raccontato poco tempo fa un aneddoto:

Segretaria di un piccolo ufficio gestisce tra le altre cose anche le utenze telefoniche. Si presentano due bellimbusti con un'offerta per telefonia e internet, chiedono di vedere l'ultima bolletta dello studio per capire se riescono a formulare un'offerta migliore di quella attualmente in essere. La segretaria mostra la bolletta e dopo un po' di scribacchiamenti gli avventori presentano un'offerta che però la segretaria rifiuta.

Dopo circa due settimane non funziona più telefono e internet. Chiamano il call center del gestore dove rispondono che probabilmente è dovuto al passaggio a nuovo operatore e non ci possono fare niente. Dopo un po' di telefonate e incazzature esce fuori il misfatto: i venditori si erano appuntati il codice di migrazione dalla bolletta ed avviato il processo di cambio gestore senza chiedere niente a nessuno.

Vendredi dans la journée, le coordinateur lycée et le directeur du lycée sont venus nous remettre les convocations, nous expliquer la cellule de crise, ne pas interférer avec l'enquête... et que le fait de ne pas se soumettre au test pourrait conduire en garde à vue.

En bref, dans le mail de jeudi soir, il est dit que le prélèvement nécessite le consentement de la personne (et de ses parents pour les mineurs). Puis on a appris le vendredi en classe qu'il serait suspect de ne pas s'y soumettre et que l'on pourrait finir en garde à vue.

After the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia, the question of the future organization of the country arose. Slovak politicians pushed for a loose federation, while Czechs advocated a more centralized model. No deal could be struck and the leaders of the both federative republics decided to dissolve the country, despite almost 2/3 of the citizens being against the dissolution.

This is obviously a simplified explanation, but that's what you get if you ask for a single paragraph. For more info, visit [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_Czechoslovakia) or read [this article](http://www.pehe.cz/prednasky/2004/the-split-of-czechoslovakia-a-defeat-or-a-victory).

As for the country's end, if we exclude speculations about WW3 or Vogon fleet, I guess the only possibility is the country acceding into a hypothetical European Federation. The recreation of Czechoslovakia has never been suggested or advocated by any political party in either of the countries and polls show most people in both countries now agree the dissolution was the right decision.",0,1397329557,null,0,false,0,cgqqp3m,t3_22vasx,t1_cgqqp3m,t3_22vasx,null,1433325827,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7
