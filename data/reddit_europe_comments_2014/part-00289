&gt;When I see more countries because western style democracies, I think it is a good thing for the world because western style democracies do not go to war with each other.

I think that, too. Not American style democracies, but EU democracies — sure. But I'm only for it if ""democracies"" aren't installed through military action. Which is the case with most American installed ""democracies"". U.S. doesn't even shy away from ousting democratically elect leaders — i.e. Iran 1953 coup, which is pretty much why Iran hates you guys so much these days.

&gt;Russia had no right to tell countries how they can defend themselves or who they can trade with.

I agree with that, too. But the same applies for the West — they shouldn't have given assurances that NATO would not expand, and they shouldn't have threatened Yanukovych with sanctions or supported the protesters. But they did.

You seem to believe that I'm justifying Russian actions. I'm not. I'm trying to put them in proper context to show that both the West and Russia are responsible, and they both act the same.

The eurozone crisis stemmed from a lack of a closer fiscal union needed to address monetary concerns. This lack of a fiscal union will undoubtedly be addressed within the coming decades so it's unlikely that a currency crisis of the scale that took place in the eurozone will occur again in further decades. 

Even considering the crisis though, it is impossible to deny that to an extent the UK is placed at a disadvantage in terms of international monetary power.

It's very interesting you are trying to convince me that I don't know history, then you are failing.

Poland was attacked from two sides by Red Army and Wehrmacht, from two sides by two most powerful armies in the world, yet never surrender, there was still AK, Polish Underground State, Polish London Government. Don't forget that when Poland was even weaker in 1920 we won against Soviet invasion of Poland during Polish-Soviet war. It was attack of powerful country on weaker, we won. 

And we are not like Denmark or Norway where the only killed German soldier was that who fell on the ice. But I understand them. Germans didn't want to enslave Danes, but Poles and Jews. 

And about France. The most annoying fact is that France was ally of Poland, we had milatary union. When Poland was attacked both France and UK refused to help our military, then they(France) got occupied with bigger failure and shame. After WW2 France was one of the ""winners"" of WW2 they occupied Germany and again despised Poland and allowed the Stalin to rule Poland. 

Now they cry, because Poland is not happy about supporting Russian invasion of Ukraine, by selling them warships... Where is the logic? Sorry for my english if I made a mistake.

Spain was fully in control of the situation. What the Spanish government could have was to decrease and scale down public building projects and other government expenditure. They could also have made construction more expensive with different levies to scale down private sectors appetite for investment. However those things didn't happen because the politicians, constructors, unions and bankers were in bed with each others. As long as construction boom would continue, it promised goods things for everyone of them... In short run.

In case of Portugal, they were already in stagnation that had started in 00s when their building boom went bust. The stagnation changed to recession, because Portuguese government was late on implementing structural changes.

In case of Ireland it was construction and property booms combined with government overspending continuously. In case of Italy it was stagnation by not implementing any reforms combined with demographic crisis. In case of France again not implementing reforms.

&gt; As for GDP per capita, how recent are your figures? What are your sources? And why is GDP per capita really the correct measure to use here, rather than PPP per capita, which makes more sense if you want to talk about wealth? And surely GDP is not the only figure worth looking at, what about employment figures? The GBP depreciated against the EUR during the financial crisis - and is currently appreciating.

In case of my figures, you can check them from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29_per_capita) and the figures that I used where from 2013 and done by IMF. The reason why I prefer nominal figures is because hard currency is hard currency. If you want to buy anything more than just local vegetables, hard currency is what you measure. And even while Pound has appreciated, like you can see from the figures, it is still a way from France.

&gt; Having the GPB has meant that the UK has been able to adopt a totally different monetary policy from the eurozone, quantitative easing, is your view that quantitative easing has not helped the UK, and the eurozone has been helped by the lack of it?

If we look at the GDP per capita (nominal) figures then I would argue that it hasn't. I would also make the same argument about the USA, in case of the USA what has really aided them has been their gas and shale oil booms that have compleatly changed the dynamics of American economy.

&gt;

&gt;A __back vowel__ is a type of [vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel) sound used in spoken [languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language). The defining characteristic of a back vowel is that the tongue is positioned as far back as possible in the mouth without creating a constriction that would be classified as a [consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant). Back vowels are sometimes also called __dark vowels__ because they are perceived as sounding darker than the [front vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_vowel).  The back vowels which have dedicated symbols in the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) are:

&gt;


&gt;* [close back unrounded vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_back_unrounded_vowel) [ɯ]

&gt;* [close back rounded vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_back_rounded_vowel) [u]

&gt;There also are back vowels which don't have dedicated symbols in the IPA:

&gt;* [near-open back unrounded vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_back_unrounded_vowel) [ɑ̝] or [ʌ̞] (normally written [ɑ], i.e. as if it were [fully open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_vowel))

Danger of abuse here is companies avoiding taxation while enjoying the single market; there is no danger in some states being able to charge extra taxes.

I don't think there's much point in having a federal personal income tax for eg - not quite sure why this was federalized in the US, though I gather it was controversial. Or property or inheritance taxation. Sales tax, Corporate tax, Energy&amp;Carbon taxation, Financial taxation and ofc tariffs - these are of interest to the federal level I think. Also unemployment benefits contributions, being a very effective automatic counter-cyclical stabilizer, something sorely lacking in the monetary union. Unlike say health or pension or generic social security &amp; welfare plans, which I don't see why they'd have a place on the federal level.

They can be sufficiently harmonized even without having a federal tax being applied to them and put into a federal budget - rates can be coordinated or capped in various ways, or gains can be redistributed to the states.

Black flags are apparently meaningful in Islam. Lately they've been co-opted by a variety of nefarious terrorist groups.

http://time.com/3311665/isis-flag-iraq-syria/

Well, usually I am doing all the things the right way. No bribes anywhere no matter what. I do respect all the rules, I do not follow the popular saying ”it works this way too”, I respect people everywhere, I am calm and civilized in traffic, I am friendly if someone requests help on streets and many other things like this.

One month ago I crossed on red light by mistake and the police caught me. It was a really nice young officer (the old ones are way too grumpy) who got my driver license suspended 30 days for this. He did not ask for a bribe, he did not suggested it and I did not try to beg him to forgive me or to find excuses like most of my countrymen do. I admitted my mistake and I told him that I will pay for it. 

And I see that many of the young people born after 1989 and a little before being too young to feel the communism are way more friendly, way more helpful, way more civilized and way more correct than the ones who were grown in communism. Of course, not all the young people are like that, but you can feel the difference in the last 4-5 years.

This is a law from the 1939 in the constitution. The governments of Ireland have all just ignored it.

It is part of the governments recent actions to remove outdated laws and decree's. As this one was in the constitution it needs a referendum to remove it which will happen with the referendums next year including one to introduce gay marriage. 

There is also a law that no business can open on a Sunday since 1938, the whole country was made an exempt area quickly after they realized their mistake.

I support the idea of the NHS existing, and I like Scandinavia, and their approach to capitalism and welfare but:

The ""Health Lives"" ranking with measures outcomes, preventable deaths, and conditions amendable to healthcare ranked the UK 10th, to the US's 11. Australia is just as obese as the UK, it is not just lifestyle.

&gt;**The only serious black mark against the NHS was its poor record on keeping people alive.** On a composite ""healthy lives"" score, which includes deaths among infants and patients who would have survived had they received timely and effective healthcare, the UK came 10th. 

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/17/nhs-health

&gt;The U.S. and **U.K.** had much higher death rates in 2007 from conditions amenable to medical care than some of the other countries, e.g., **rates 25 percent to 50 percent higher** than Australia and Sweden

http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2014/jun/mirror-mirror

The NHS is having funding cut, it is being privatised, standards of care are falling, and there are cultural problems within NHS. If you want to argue about something being 'socialist' and working, don't use the NHS as an example. I agree with you, but you're wrong about the NHS.

Why are GPs turning people back all across the country if the NHS is the best? Why does stuff like [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-29383247) happen if it's ""pure socialism""? How does Mid Staffordhire happen?

There are two points of views that both lead to these actions regarding the south (and remember those are not the only points of views, those are just the two big ones in favor of what is happening):

1. The south are lazy leachers that just try to get unto our success, we the german people have build everything up from ruins, from a completely destroyed country and people and through hard work we got right back on the top! In the meantime, the people in the south got complacent, they tried to cut too big of a portion of the pie for themselfs (their wages increased even more than their GDP increased, meanwhile german wages didn't increase that much other than inflation while the GDP increased a lot, this was done for stability and safety against crisis etc. and now we think they tried to get too much out of everything while they didn't have enough of everything so they were too greedy) and you let the whole place get corrupted with your lazy/sleezy attitude. If we germans are going to pay for your fuck-ups with our hard earned money, then we make sure that you will be in a position to pay it back, we want that money again, so we are going to make you cut a lot of stuff, so that you will be able to give us that money back in the future, because we all know it you are just trying to take our money from us, your corrupt system will get most of it, and then the germans will see nothing of it every again.

2. We germans through good forward thinking, hard cuts (to the social security system and a lot of cuts everywhere basically) put ourselfs in a position, where we are competitive even now and successfully got over the crisis. We learned those lesson, eventhough they were hard (german standard of living didn't increase for 6 years after reunifications, giants cuts were made to the social secucity system etc.) through reunification, it worked for us, trimming all that fat away has helped us stay in a competitive place. Now those other countries will have to do the same stuff germany did, so they can get rid of their corruptioon and all the unneccessary fat, and after the austerity is done and you are at a reasonable place, you can start growing the economy just like germany did and you will end up in a good place, because that is how we did it and we are awesome :D

Those are the main two feelings in germany that are pro austerity, I have not said that I aggree with any of them (eventhough to a lesser extend i kinda aggree with the first one, but i think growing their economy through stimulation would be a better way to ensure the money back, and im not as hardcore with that line of thought, i dont aggree with any of those fully), there are loads of smaller things for it and also a lot of people are against austerity, as always in the real world, it is never black and white.

Ohh and for the hero and leader thing:

It may sound really stupid because WW2 is long gone, however from a young age we germans are basically indoctrinated that nationalism/patriotism/thinking off you (openly) that you are the best are all really bad things and do lead to really bad things (as they can, shown 19th 20th century in europe for example, but they dont have to, and I think if those views are not too hardcore they can actually be beneficial).

And we are taught that germany and germans are not fit to lead, we are fit to support, able to change small details so stuff turns out the way we want it, act from behind the curtains as a benevolent helper, however we germans are not fit to lead and we can and might be really really fucking horrible. The word leader itself (Führer) is nearly completely useless in the german language and kind of symbolises our problem.

In class we have debates about nationalism and we do a lot about germany b4 during and after ww2 so we understand  how it happened, how horrible it was and how it could have been done better, like 2/3 of my history class was around WW2, and in basically every class there is atleast one fairly big topic about nazis (not science classes, eventhough we did mention nazis in physics), like we read jewish literature and post ww2 and during ww2 literatur, the during ww2 were either pro nazi or by people that ran away from germany. 

In religion class we talk about the ethics that were going on at that time and how christians lived during nazi germany, and how they maybe should have acted.

In 9th grade I went to a concentration camp, even having to step into the gas shower, looking at the oven seeing pictures of mass graves, looking into the little baracks that they lived in, seeing pictures with them beeing overcrowded and constantly beeing reminded WE did this.

So from that standpoint it is, while it may be sad, understandable why germany sometimes acts slowly, merkel has to ease the general german public into taking more of a leadership role, beeing more proactive in serious matter, because until the economic crisis, we really weren't doing that sort of stuff, she constantly has to test how far she can go and slowly get the german public to accept its new role.

I might not like that, but that is the reality we deal with.

But because they don't love their families, and think better off themselfs and are cold and unemotional, they have no heart in it while fighting, so the french without a real reason to fight other than their arrogance to show they are apparently better than germany (which they clearly aren't because germans fight to protect their home, their wife and children and their culture), they will easily run if they get actually threatened.

They are arrogant whenever they can but the second there is a problem and they see their are not as superior as they thought, they will cry and get scared and frightened, and because they don't fight with soul, and because they don't fight because of the love for the vaterland and the family, they have no reason to be there and they turn and run.

This comes from the different types of nationalisms the nations had at the time (idk the english words so ill just translate the german ones, hope that is okay).

Germany (from beeing a lot of sovereign states when nationalism was on the rise) was a cultural nationalism, talking in german, liking german literature the music of old and new, appreciating the soul in german work of art, and living the hard working germanspeaking german live, will make you a german no matter where you are! (Like people in austrohungarian empire that thought of themselfs as german while living in prag etc.) Not that you don't have to fullfill al criteria, only beeing hardworking and speaking german makes you already a full german, but literature like writing yourself or reading a lot of books helps you be more accepted/thought of as better, more german etc. and can help you if you are not hardworking etc.

The french nationalism thanks to it beeing one single nation, that is still really proud of napoleon keeping them together under his system and what they did under him, and proud of the revolution, killing that hated monarchy and instating the best form of government in the world, a democracy, has a different kind of nationalism (I really don't know how to translate the german word in english here, hope you forgive me).

You are french if you live under the french system, vote, help the french state, live in france and try to work/think yourself up in social live abiding the rules. This is what makes you french, and what makes the other not french...

I could go into more detail about french stereotypes about germans to help illustrate my point, and if you wish to do so I will, or I could show some more stereotypes the germans had, it didn't end there, however I hope this was good enough and that I did atleast a reasonable job at explaining it :D",0,1412108084,null,0,false,0,ckwtkgm,t3_2hu4ji,t1_ckwtkgm,t1_ckwqj16,null,1426748358,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Property, especially private property, which they distinguish from 'personal property', involves someone having a kind of rulership and it is that kind of thing that anarchism opposes.

Personal property is unproblematic even in anarchism, but is contrasted with private property, typically defined as privately owned means of production, such as land rented out to others which is regarded as illegitimate.

It is an somewhat old ideology with an origin in France and the modern so-called ""anarcho""-capitalists have never been part of its actual traditions, being regarded as people who attempt to usurp the name, just as the now so-called libertarians usurped that name (it originally referred to the kind views that were espoused for example by [Joseph Déjacque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_D%C3%A9jacque) which were quite far to the left).",0,1412108224,null,0,false,0,ckwtn4k,t3_2hvcn0,t1_ckwtn4k,t1_ckws8xv,null,1426748324,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

As to the relationship of the countries, term above was damaging (""doesn't actually do anything that would hurt""), not hostile (later question was whence the european hostility towards the relationship, quite different than saying something about it being a hostile country). Now that entirely depends on the methods used to battle for one's (eternally) dissenting position - recklessly destructive tantrums and blackmails obviously alienate one from potential future allies. Voting against a proposition one disagrees with and defending that vote with a topical argument is in fact highly welcome.

For eg, a public campaign after the public elections rather than before, as opposed to coalition building with the nations for a vote where one might still defeat an unwelcome development is a fairly deep gutter of political filth. Though simultaneous complaints about lack of electability in EU power and active prevention of such electability are fairly repulsive in their hypocrisy to start with. You can see how welcome this kind of behavior was by the final vote.

So is vetoing a crucial policy not involving the UK in one unrelated segment (or if anything negatively related given the role of the financial system as it stood was in creating the crisis leading to the fiscal compact) so as to try and force concessions in another. Here the UK is directly attempting to prevent others from integrating further, at a point where obviously the monetary union requires further integration to function! To opportunistically take advantage of their predicament, rather than at the very least not kicking them when they're down. You can see how welcome this kind of behavior was by indignant circumvention instead of appeasement of this tactic.

Obviously simultaneously complaining about the amount payed into the EU budget and demanding a mechanism that will make any amount invested into the UK mitigate this amount only by a third its nominal value is a fairly clear signal one is more interested in complaining about the EU for domestic consumption than in real engagement.

Depending on how much money you've already invested in university in the US, you might want to stick it out.  Unless you have funding lined up in Germany, you still have to provide proof that you have a minimum of 650€ a month for living expenses, lined up in advance.  As a student, you can work on-campus as much as you want, or you can work a taxed job only 90 full days/ 180 half days a year.

Private financial aid is mostly out of the picture unless you can line something up in the US.  There are a couple of important things to point out.

*Scholarships in Germany are really only for like the top 1% of students, applications are all in German.  There are really only a few private ""Studienstiften"" that offer them and you can generally only apply after you've got some grades in from the German university.

*Starting from birth and going up to age 25 (if you are enrolled in education, up to the level of a master's degree), the government sends German kids and permanent residents (and in some cases, just those with residence permits who give birth in Germany) a certain amount of money per kid to cover stuff like new clothes, piano lessons, whatever.  Once you are at university, then your parents generally just hand you the cash.  This is generally enough to cover a room in a shared apartment or dorm in most university cities.  If your parents don't spend this money on you, you can sue them.  The courts almost always side with the kid.

*If you are a German citizen or permanent resident, your parents are also legally required to cover all of your educational expenses either until you turn 25 or finish a master's degree.  If your parents don't pay up, then you can sue them.  If your family is low-income and can't afford to support you while you are pursuing education, then the government will give you low-income student loans that don't have to be paid back until years after you graduate.  At present, the max amount that generally has to be paid back, no matter how much you received, is around €10k.  If you pay the loans back all at once, then you get another couple grand knocked off.

*Bachelor's and master's degrees are essentially undergrad - master's degrees aren't lumped in with grad school like in the US.  Teaching assistantships and research assistantships are exclusively for PhD students.  If your professor wants someone around to do some basic research, your professor will usually ask you individually.  A lot of people stay at the same university for both their BA and MA, so you're at a disadvantage, because your profs will already have known a lot of people for years already.

*German banks will typically not offer educational loans to people who have lived here for less than five years and who aren't making bank on the side.  Most American banks are totally clueless about anything that happens outside of the U.S. and are unwilling to issue educational loans unless you have a ton of income in the US at the same time.  (Just went through this recently when I was trying to get some private funding to pay for a whole bunch of stuff for my PhD that wasn't covered by the university or outside funding and that I just wanted to knock out of the way at once.)

If you go for a year or so as an undergrad, then it will give you the chance to see if you can handle two years.  Your university in the US will more than likely have a ton of funding and some work-study agreement in place already.  Once you have finished your BA, you are eligible for funding from Fulbright and DAAD, but not before.

More anecdotally, for the last four years, I've lived in a ""traditional"" university city.  105,000 residents, about 35,000 students; roughly 15% of residents are foreigners.  There have recently been a number of meetings around my university about the huge attrition of master's students who show up, have special dreams that Germans will suddenly speak perfect English to them, and open them with welcome arms.  Students who have already spent time in Germany know what they're in for.

Also, in German classes in the US, you talk a whole lot about stuff that is relevant for university studies (war, death, poverty, film terminology, etc.), but the first time you go for a haircut or need to ask your building maintenance crew how to turn off your fire alarm when you accidentally burn something in the oven, you're effed.  Need to go to the ER?  Most Germans can read English pretty well, especially with the help of a dictionary, or ask for ketchup while eating out on vacation, but sometimes you might have to wait for a doctor to come around that feels comfortable explaining your problem to you in English - yes, even at university clinics.  That's practical vocabulary that you can only learn from being in a country.  I've been in Germany eight of the last 10 years, am engaged to a German, have a MA in German (and another one in English), am working on a PhD, and last week at the university clinic, the doctor and I both had to get on Google because I was having a brain fart and could only remember the brand name of a certain medication... that has a completely different name here.

Winters are oppressive and get much darker than they do in the US - the southernmost point in Germany is still farther north than the northernmost point in the US.  Germans aren't known for being extroverted, so a lot of times, you really do have to put on your extroverted hat and invite people you don't know well but that seem OK to go get a cup of coffee, because there's a 99% chance that they won't ask you.  Even then, sometimes you have to chalk it up to being a silly, extroverted American.  Another city where I studied had a US Army base that is now closing down, and a lot of landlords didn't want to rent to me because they had had a rough time with soldiers screwing up their property and then PCSing out, so even though the landlord still had the deposit, it still wasn't enough to cover the property damage.  Most people have no concept of charity, unless it deals with cute children in a third-world country.  If you want special foods from home, a lot of the time, you have to plan for it at least a few days in advance.  

Holidays are on different days and things can shut down for days at a time, so you really have to pay attention when you first get here, to make sure that you've got enough food in the fridge to make it through whatever random saint's day it is.  Different things are polite (it's OK to stare at people and blow your nose in public, but sniffling is extremely rude and people will butt into you without saying ""excuse me"") and there are lots of unspoken cultural rules that you can generally only get from experiencing the culture first-hand.  You have to be able to make mistakes in terms of breaking these rules and not beat yourself down when you break them.  (I moved to Hungary without really knowing the language well, and accidentally visited a vet when I got stung by a wasp in Tesco, just because I saw a Hungarian compound word where the first part looked like the German word for ""general"" and then the Hungarian word for ""doctor""!)  

I love living here.  I love the language, have a high quality of life and think that the quality of life here is generally pretty great, and plan to die here.  My fiancé was offered a green card via his employer but we still want to stay here.  However, contrary to hoop dreams and Hollywood, the vast majority of life here does not consist of grilling bratwurst and watching soccer and drinking beer on a hot summer day while surrounded by extroverted blondes in bikinis who speak perfect English.

TL; DR - If you think you can handle the bad stuff, too, then go for it.  And don't say that you weren't warned.  : ) 

ETA - I just had a long conversation with a friend about lousy customer service and lazy employees.  If you need anything done here, you have to add the phrase ""Can I talk to your manager?"" and make a scene and suddenly the employee knows how to fix everything.  (In particular we discussed one situation where we didn't get our receipt, went back 30 minutes later with a defective product and another print-out with the transaction number on it.  I used the same point-of-sale system in the US.  The employee swore up and down that she couldn't look up old receipts until I told her I knew how to and would be happy to show her how.)  Most Germans don't grow up with learning how to complain to customer service and aren't ballsy enough to do it.  Sometimes the manager will side with the lazy employee though.  There are so many online groups with people who bought shoes, tried them on at home, decided they were too small without ever having worn them out, and then re-sell them rather than return them.  (Don't get me started on most German flea markets, though.  I recently pissed someone off because I pointed out that they wanted more for a banged-up used product than the product costs new - and they still wanted the higher price, even after showing them proof that it is still cheaper new.)  On the other hand, if you ask a German how you look and they think you look like crap, they will tell you that you look like crap.

So, I will try to be shorter (I said try), not to conviece you, but just to present a French point of view (witch mean that I am not fighting with you at all).

For the 1st point (The south are lazy leachers), I don't think normal ppl are lazy there. I think they have been fucked up by their politics and it's hard for me to see that the population has been punished but not the politics that has cheat them, even if I do agree that, at the end, every one have to pay their dept.

Thus, for all of the ww2 stories, I think France had already accept a lot in forgiveness to Germany (And our peacefull relation is something I cherish). As I told you else where, we don't have anymore hate for you, just missunderstanding.

As you said, nowodayd German ppls are the more affected with ww2. The point is that French ppls are more affected with Vichy gov action in ww2 than with our craps in our colonial empire, but we know we done craps. So, that's one of the reasons why French ppls supported hugely French war in Mali to support the population their. We have humanity dept to them so we are ready to die for them (and I mean the ppls, not their corrupted gov).

Then, I come back to the € crisis. We hate their corrupted government but we don't think that normal ppls have to be only ones to pay the price of being refounded by us (if French had to vote in a referendum that weither or not former Greek president have to be beheaded, French will vote 90% yes !). In an other hand, I find stupid to ask 2ww Nazi historical dept to support any country fully refounding.

Then, about your bad press ... let say that the UK one is worst but we are used to it. They predict the fall of France as far as I remember and probably since a millenium and a half. We are still alive so what UK press says of us ... 

I just don't know what bad thing we done to Germany to deserve it ? I mean, we accpted to don't humiliate you after ww2, to support your export trade to be sure that you will not be weak compare to RDA, that you can reunite US, UK, FR Germany, that you can reunite with Est germany and became the strongest EU power. So why your press just like to be bad with us?

    [1] Sie irren, Herr Bleibein!      
    [1] Verzeihung, da habe ich mich wohl geirrt.         

Beide Formen werden aufgeführt, auch wenn über den Artikel steht, dass eine Erläuterung, wann welche Form gebraucht werden soll, fehlt. Da steht nirgends, dass eine der beiden Formen veraltet oder falsch sei.

&gt;Es gibt ein Sprichwort: Es gehört oft mehr Mut dazu, seine Meinung zu ändern als ihr treu zu bleiben.

Wir disktuieren hier aber nicht über Meinungen, sondern in erster Linie darüber, ob ""Sie irren."" korrekt ist oder nicht und ob es in Gebrauch ist.

Similarly, if you used a factory to exploit workers, they would simply go on producing with it, ignoring your attempts to own it in the private property sense, since you would not own the factory in the private property sense.

I believe that it should be clear from these examples that there are in fact fewer restrictions in proper anarchism.

You got any proof for that? Besides your personal opinion, and guesses about the percentage? I also think it would probably be pretty illegal for the German government, but IANAL.

Wow, really? The US shares *most* of its intelligence gathered in Germany with the German government. This is really a part of this whole 'affaire' that the German government seems *really* shy to tell its own citizens. In other words, the German government isn't telling German citizens the whole truth about the whole spy affaire. 

This is, in part, because intelligence activities undertaken by governments is absolutely 'Top Secret'. 

However, there is certainly a lot that Merkel isn't saying. 

Do you have any ideas what kinds of capabilities the US gov't has in intelligence gathering, compared to Germany? That the US is actually not only *willing* to help Germany with the area of intelligence gathering, but that the US also *didn't* tell the general public about classified intelligence gathering operations done in tandem with the German government - after all of Germany was pissed at the US for spying - is an enourmous service to Germany. 

For example, I don't think the normal German realizes - that hey, if they don't speak Arabic, there's pretty much no chance they're under threat of possible coming under surveillance. 

I'll say that again - 

It is my opinion, my feeling, that almost nobody in Germany who doesn't write or speak Arabic is even under *threat* of being targeted for surveillance by the US. 

Germans may say 'what about Merkel? she doesn't speak Arabic!' 

My answer to that - is that Germany spied on US leaders too (Hillary Clinton and John Kerry), so perhaps that's a different issue. 

The stationing of US troops on German soil is another issue, but I don't think you realize all of the good that those troops do for Germany, in any event. 

Do you *really* think that the German government is telling the German people everything?

 * ponderate bene sulla tipologia di società che avete intenzione di avviare, rimanete un libero artiere con p.iva fino a quando non vi potete permettere di aprire una srl/srls o equivalente ente con rischio limitato al capitale societario

-settore dell'arte

 * prima di imbarcarvi in un'avventura imprenditoriale, fate esperienza, e rimembrate che la saggezza imprenditoriale ha 3 caratteri fondamentali:

       * l'area di foggia tecnica, dove il professionista si diletta nell'apprendere le innumerevoli sfaccettature di una particolare arte

       * l'area della vendita, dove il venditore col tempo eccelle nel trattare con i clienti, e rientra in questo campo anche il sapere del marketing, che precede il contatto fra acquirente e venditore

       * l'area dei numeri e dell'amministrazione, dove l'organizzatore si impegna a ridurre al minimo i tempi di lavoro e gli sprechi, aumentare l'efficienza e l'automazione, mantiene i contatti con gli esperti commercialisti, fiscalisti e legali

       * vi sarebbe un quarto figuro, quello de lo investitore, il gentiluomo col denaro che decide di finanziare l'opera imprenditoriale, che non puode completamente definirsi saggio, ma che detiene comunque potere e deve quindi essere capace di giudicare le proprie e le altrui decisioni ed azioni

Se non eccellete in almeno uno di questi settori, mio caro buon amico, vi prego di NON procedere con l'avventura imprenditoriale e di soffermarvi prima sulla prima o sulla seconda, che sono le strade più semplici (badate bene, NON dicevo FACILI, ma semplici poichè si puode partire da zero)

-settore de l'arte de la vendita e del marketing

 * quando avete deciso il settore di mercato a cui volete accostarvi, badate bene ai vostri avversari in campo, chiedete ai compratori e clienti de li competitori vostri e SOPRATTUTTO arrivate a capire cosa ancora tal zona di mercato chiede, quali particolari grattacapi potete voi risolvere a questi clienti che, seppur scontenti, comprano poichè in bisogno ma al tempo stesso impossibilitati di scegliere alternative poichè non esistono

 * testate la vostra idea e SOPRATTUTTO la realizzazione de la idea stessa, e ricordate che la differenza fra la buona e la cattiva impresa sono i denari che entrano meno quelli che escono, e quindi un flusso costante di clienti è la cosa più importante, ancora PIU' IMPORTANTE de la idea imprenditoriale stessa

È tardi e il sottoscrivente è infiacchito e spossato dal richiamo di Morfeo, quello che ho elencato è una MINIMA parte delle considerazioni di cui tener conto, ma essendo le prime in ordine di numero ad essermi balzate al pensiero, sono quelle che per ora vi trasmetto. Semmai dovessero venirmi a mente altre importanti nozioni e concetti ve li porrò in seguito.

You will probably have to pay import duties. These could be considerable. 

You will have to get a European Conformance Certificate (I believe that's what it's called), which certifies the vehicle conforms to EU regulations. If it doesn't (and it likely won't), you'll have to pay for the conversion work to be done. Since its a German manufacturer, you'll be better off than if it was an American one, but the car was still built for the US market, not the EU, and there are substantial differences.  It shouldn't be hard to find a dealership or mechanic that can do this for you, but it will cost you. 

Most cities will be able to offer you a license plate that fits, either a normal plate that isn't as wide or an American-sized plate with two lines (you see these around American bases a lot). 

Also, bear in mind that just because it conforms to EU specs doesn't mean everything will be perfect. The American spec car will probably have an electronic governor, so that will need to be removed if you want to top it out on the autobahn, if it's even possible. If you have an in-dash GPS unit, it's probable it won't work at all or you may end up with limited functionality (since many US-spec GPS units can't be loaded with full EU maps).

Direi deviazioni rispetto ad un risultato atteso - stranamente, al lavoro, anche le deviazioni 'positive' (risultati piu' favorevoli del previsto) a volte possono dare rogne.. pure piu' delle deviazioni 'negative', per le quali in genere sono pronti fondi/piani di contingenza.  

Poi, nel linguaggio comune, posso parlare di 'rischio' per intendere qualunque evento inaspettato e infausto - tipo il rischio di essere preso a cazzotti da un ubriaco alla fermata dell'autobus, o il rischio di beccarmi una multona all'autovelox.


&gt; come definireste il concetto di ""caso""?

Direi l'insieme dei fattori non conoscibili o esattamente quantificabili che portano ad un certo risultato.  

&gt; come definireste il concetto di ""probabile/improbabile""?

Penso che una cosa sia probabile se credo che si verifichera' piu' di quanto non creda che non si verifichera'. Poi, nel discorrere comune, si dice che una cosa e' probabile se si crede *molto* di piu' che una cosa si verifichera' rispetto a che non si verifichera'.

Also bis auf die Erschießung von Grenzverletzern ist das heute nicht anders, sondern sogar wesentlich schlimmer. Geändert hat sich nur, dass dies frei genannt wird von denen, die davon profitieren.

1. Freie Wahlen
haben hier seit der Wiedervereinigung noch nie stattgefunden. Wahlen haben nur den Zweck der Legitimierung der Einheitspartei. Ob wir 5 Personen oder 600 oder 10 000 im Parlament sitzen haben spielt keine Rolle. An die Macht kommt immer die Einheitspartei. Selbst die Opposition stimmt stets für die Einheitspartei oder koaliert mit ihr obwohl es eine Mehrheit abseits dessen gibt. Die einzig reale Oppositionspartei ist ausgerechnet die aus der PDS hervorgegangene Linke aus dem ""Unrechtsstaat"". Dazu gesellen sich 50% Nichtwähler, undenkbar in der DDR.

2. Gewaltenteilung existiert schlicht nicht. Dies beginnt ganz oben in der EU, in welche die Exekutive der Nationalstaaten im Ministerrat sitzt und legislative Tätigkeiten ausübt. Klassischer Teil des Faschismus. 
Geht man auf tiefere Ebenen, muss man ja schon weit von der Realität entfernt argumentieren, um in Deutschland so etwas wie eine Gewaltenteilung zu erkennen. Bei uns ist die Exekutive an Weisungen der Legislative gebunden. Das machen nicht einmal die Diktaturen in der arabischen Welt so offensichtlich.

3. Massenweise Bespitzelung. Ich glaube dazu muss man nichts mehr sagen. Seit dem NSA Skandal gilt die DDR ja als Bürgerrechtsstaat, der die Privatsphäre seiner Bürger nicht halb so schlimm verletzte wie es heutzutage der Fall ist. Auch heute entscheiden Geheimdienste darüber, wer Grundrechte genießt und wer nicht, man hilft Drittstaaten Deutsche zu entführen und zu foltern etc.

Es dürfte klar sein, dass nur Apologeten und Profiteure des derzeitigen Systems in diesem irgendein positives Gegenstück zur DDR sehen.

I certainly would like to see more EU companies set up offices and factories here and there. But losing American factories and offices? No thinks. We've already lost a Dell factory.

It seems like the EC is jealous that we have all those American factories and offices in our country which they have very little of. Understandable. But instead of blaming Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands for this, maybe other EU countries should start making their countries friendlier to US companies IMHO.

I assume that Germans don't make mistakes with genders because the gender of a word actually matters in speech too. ""Das vs. dass"" and issues with commas, on the other hand, don't affect pronunciation and would probably be easy to screw up in writing.

It's funny, because sometimes I swear that non-native speakers of many languages actually make fewer orthographic mistakes than natives, because they had to learn all of those rules in a slow, painstaking way as adults. They learned the language by memorizing prescribed rules and if you deviate even slightly from those rules, they won't understand you.

North Italy had a pretty large sugar refinement industry until a few years ago. This industry was well established, providing seasonal workers, logistic companies and cultivation with a reliable income.

Then one day, the [European community decides that Italy is producing too much sugar](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eridania#La_direttiva_europea_e_la_chiusura_degli_stabilimenti). Sugar refinement companies are granted monetary compensation, provided that the refineries are closed and destroyed. Reconversion to energy production is forbidden. The sites must be lopped clean. The alternative is fines from the EU. Consequence: layoffs, complete destruction of the industrial resource, and of the network of related services.

Translation: the EU is a scam aimed at destroying the industrial infrastructure of non-German, non-French, non-Scandinavian industry, leaving these countries work 37 hours per week, sitting on a pile of money, while the ""lazy Italians"" work 60 hours per week, with 40% unemployment created by the very policies that the EU forced Italy to accept. And then they have the courage to complain.

The stadium has an interesting history. The Hill 16 end was made using rumble from Dublin city centre from the 1916 rising - an armed uprising against British rule. 

In 1920, during the Irish War of Independence, British troops and armoured vehicles broke inside and went onto the playing field during a game. They shot into the stands. 14 civilians including one player on the pitch were killed. 

The first soccer and rugby games were only held there recently. Foreign games, primarily soccer and rugby were banned there.

A change like this will always be a big ""drastic"" change for some reason. It is not a reason not to do it. It is a proposed solution to the problem of tax havens and just because you cannot predict everything that might happen if it is implemented then it does not mean we should not make the attempt to do it.

They oppose it on ideological grounds of course.

&gt;I'm sure you can see why a system where Ireland gets systematically raped and pillaged by pretty much every other country in the EU would not go down well in Ireland. Seriously, taking money from small countries and giving it to large ones is highly counter-intuitive and counter-productive. Why should money flow from Ireland, Croatia and Lithuania to Germany and the UK, where is the fairness in that?

The fairness lies in the fact that right now a minority is screwing over the majority by bending over for corporations.

But, I mean, really? I'm not even sure that anything I said was even all that controversial. 

For example - in order to 'spy' like the NSA does, you have to have targets. Sorry - political correctness - most of those so-called 'targets' will be people from an Arabic background, who speak Arabic. They will go on the Arabic internet, as it were, write on their facebook pages in Arabic, and so on and so forth. However, there are obviously many different languages and dialects that fall under that broader language umbrella. So, not only do you need translators - or in other words, native speakers. You need to have such people working for the government, and being them themselves trustworthy beyond reproach. Working for the FBI, for example. Those aren't such easy people to find! 

So, you find a candidate, and train them for a year or more even initially, as to how to work 'terrorism' with the FBI/CIA/US Gov. 

Then you have to find *so many* of such people, to cover not only enough dialects or what have you, but in order to work on so many cases! 

Do you guys realize the immense amount of training and the infrastructure behind such training, in order to produce a translation analyst/specialist working for the NSA? 

Germany does *not* have that kind of infrastructure. The BND does not have the *ability* to train the amount of specialists it takes to do the kind of work that the NSA is ***mostly*** doing in Germany. 

So, the US helps Germany. By doing so, the US is - of course - also helping itself, because as the Hamburg Terror Cell situation illustrated, if there are places such people can safely congregate in Europe that may directly effect the security of the US. 

We're also helping keep Germany a safe place. For example, a lot of 'that' has to do with the *don't even THINK about it* effect that the US helping Germany with surveillance has towards 'would-be' terrorists. 

Those are just some points. They are not exhaustive, and I may have not added a caveat here or a qualification there, but these are examples of thoughts I have about the NSA Affaire that I absolutely *never* hear from the German side. I ask myself ""why not?"" To my mind, they are at least relatively legitimate. 

______________________
*
When I say ***mostly*** above, I'm saying that I do not think that 100% of all surveillance activities of the US in Germany were all totally legitimate. I don't know, maybe I would put that number at between 60% and 80% of all US surveillance activities in Germany were clean and was in working with the German government, where the German government had full knowledge. 

But guys, you make it sound like 100% of the spying the US did in Germany - both the German government didn't know about - and it was just spying on normal kids, guys hanging out, and it was for no reason!!! 

I mean, let's get real here. 

If you're a German and never spoke a word of Arabic in your life, the chances that you've been personally targeted by the US govt for surveillance are between slim and none, and slim just left town.

""At a time when scientific opinion is central to EU policy making and legislative processes, the idea of a single person secretly advising the Commission on all science related matters, from climate change, to toxic chemicals, GMOs, fracking and fisheries, is not only unscientific, it is also in direct contradiction to the democratic process enshrined by the European Union,"" says David Azoulay, Senior Attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL). ""It is critical that EU lawmakers have access to the best representation of wide-ranging and transparent scientific advice to carry out their work; asking one single person to secretly determine what science ‘is’ on a subject is a grave mistake.”

As someone who is a scientist who studies swans, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls geese swans. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""swan family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Anatidae, which includes things from mallards to diving ducks to Canadian geese.

So your reasoning for calling a goose a swan is because random people ""call the French ones swans?"" Let's get pigeons and sparrows in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A goose is a goose and a member of the goose family. But that's not what you said. You said a goose is a swan, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the goose family swans, which means you'd call mallards, wood ducks, and other birds swans, too.

Je ne sais pas l'origine exacte de tous les stéréotypes, mais je t'assure que les américains ont des stéréotypes pour presque chaque pays ou culture. En fait, je trouve qu'il est difficile à croire que c'est pas le même partout. Les humains jugent ; c'est juste la réalité. 

Cependant, tu as raison : les américains ne savent pas quand c'est trop. A mon avis, ils continuent à utiliser ces stéréotypes pour deux raisons : Ils veulent sembler cool à leurs amis et il veulent faire partie de la conversation. La deuxième raison suit: beaucoup d'américains sait presque rien des autres cultures. Et la raison pour celà est simple : il ne faut pas connaitre une autre culture ou une autre langue pour réussir aux E.U. Il faut comprendre l'anglais et la culture américaine, et c'est tout. Et donc, en générale, après on est diplômé, on n'étudie pas les cultures étrangères. 

Une petit exemple : Un de mes amis a travaillé à une «study abroad fair», c'est à dire une sorte de salon pour les étudiants qui veulent étudier à l'étranger. Bref, mon ami, il s'occupait un stand pour un programme au Québec, et un étudiant lui a dit (en anglais, bien sûr), «Le Québec, c'est en France, n'est-ce pas?»  Oui, il y a des gens si ignorant.

Je te conseillerais d'ignorer les stéréotypes qui concernent ta propre culture, ou en fait les stéréotypes en générale. Et je veux attirer l'attention sur tous les commentaires positifs des Français sur Reddit, car ils existent ; je les ai vu. Pas tous le monde est ignorant.

J'espère que celà soit utile.
